301,301,301,Using Dynamic Stochastic Modelling to Estimate Population Risk Factors in Infectious Disease: The Example of FIV in 15 Cat Populations,13.949601,7.34878,2009-10-16,"BACKGROUND: In natural cat populations, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) is transmitted through bites between individuals. Factors such as the density of cats within the population or the sex-ratio can have potentially strong effects on the frequency of fight between individuals and hence appear as important population risk factors for FIV. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To study such population risk factors, we present data on FIV prevalence in 15 cat populations in northeastern France. We investigate five key social factors of cat populations; the density of cats, the sex-ratio, the number of males and the mean age of males and females within the population. We overcome the problem of dependence in the infective status data using sexually-structured dynamic stochastic models. Only the age of males and females had an effect (p = 0.043 and p = 0.02, respectively) on the male-to-female transmission rate. Due to multiple tests, it is even likely that these effects are, in reality, not significant. Finally we show that, in our study area, the data can be explained by a very simple model that does not invoke any risk factor. CONCLUSION: Our conclusion is that, in host-parasite systems in general, fluctuations due to stochasticity in the transmission process are naturally very large and may alone explain a larger part of the variability in observed disease prevalence between populations than previously expected. Finally, we determined confidence intervals for the simple model parameters that can be used to further aid in management of the disease.","Fouchet, David; Leblanc, Guillaume; Sauvage, Frank; Guiserix, Micheline; Poulet, Hervé; Pontier, Dominique",PLoS One,142,17
340,340,340,Calculating the potential for within-flight transmission of influenza A (H1N1),13.888866,7.295666,2009-12-24,"BACKGROUND: Clearly air travel, by transporting infectious individuals from one geographic location to another, significantly affects the rate of spread of influenza A (H1N1). However, the possibility of within-flight transmission of H1N1 has not been evaluated; although it is known that smallpox, measles, tuberculosis, SARS and seasonal influenza can be transmitted during commercial flights. Here we present the first quantitative risk assessment to assess the potential for within-flight transmission of H1N1. METHODS: We model airborne transmission of infectious viral particles of H1N1 within a Boeing 747 using methodology from the field of quantitative microbial risk assessment. RESULTS: The risk of catching H1N1 will essentially be confined to passengers travelling in the same cabin as the source case. Not surprisingly, we find that the longer the flight the greater the number of infections that can be expected. We calculate that H1N1, even during long flights, poses a low to moderate within-flight transmission risk if the source case travels First Class. Specifically, 0-1 infections could occur during a 5 hour flight, 1-3 during an 11 hour flight and 2-5 during a 17 hour flight. However, within-flight transmission could be significant, particularly during long flights, if the source case travels in Economy Class. Specifically, two to five infections could occur during a 5 hour flight, 5-10 during an 11 hour flight and 7-17 during a 17 hour flight. If the aircraft is only partially loaded, under certain conditions more infections could occur in First Class than in Economy Class. During a 17 hour flight, a greater number of infections would occur in First Class than in Economy if the First Class Cabin is fully occupied, but Economy class is less than 30% full. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide insights into the potential utility of air travel restrictions on controlling influenza pandemics in the winter of 2009/2010. They show travel by one infectious individual, rather than causing a single outbreak of H1N1, could cause several simultaneous outbreaks. These results imply that, during a pandemic, quarantining passengers who travel in Economy on long-haul flights could potentially be an important control strategy. Notably, our results show that quarantining passengers who travel First Class would be unlikely to be an effective control strategy.","Wagner, Bradley G; Coburn, Brian J; Blower, Sally",BMC Med,142,22
456,456,456,Environmental factors preceding illness onset differ in phenotypes of the juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies,13.495314,7.2906995,2010-08-27,"Objective. To assess whether certain environmental factors temporally associated with the onset of juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (JIIMs) differ between phenotypes. Methods. Physicians completed questionnaires regarding documented infections, medications, immunizations and an open-ended question about other noted exposures within 6 months before illness onset for 285 patients with probable or definite JIIM. Medical records were reviewed for 81% of the patients. Phenotypes were defined by standard clinical and laboratory measures. Results. Sixty per cent of JIIM patients had a reported exposure within 6 months before illness onset. Most patients (62%) had one recorded exposure, 26% had two and 12% had three to five exposures. Patients older than the median age at diagnosis, those with a longer delay to diagnosis and those with anti-signal recognition particle autoantibodies had a higher frequency of documented exposures [odds ratios (ORs) 95% CI 3.4, 31]. Infections were the most common exposure and represented 44% of the total number of reported exposures. Non-infectious exposures included medications (18%), immunizations (11%), stressful life events (11%) and unusual sun exposure (7%). Exposures varied by age at diagnosis, race, disease course and the presence of certain myositis autoantibodies. Conclusion. The JIIMs may be related to multiple exposures and these appear to vary among phenotypes.","Rider, Lisa G.; Wu, Lan; Mamyrova, Gulnara; Targoff, Ira N.; Miller, Frederick W.",Rheumatology,142,1

F4 is a fusion protein comprising HIV-1 antigens p17 and p24, reverse transcriptase and Nef. This study assessed the toxicity, biodistribution and shedding profiles of MV1-F4. Cynomolgus macaques were intramuscularly immunized one or three times with the highest dose of MV1-F4 intended for clinical use, the reference (Schwarz) measles vaccine or saline, and monitored clinically for 11 or 85 days. Toxicological parameters included local and systemic clinical signs, organ weights, haematology, clinical and gross pathology and histopathology. Both vaccines were well tolerated, with no morbidity, clinical signs or gross pathological findings observed. Mean spleen weights were increased after three doses of either vaccine, which corresponded with increased numbers and/or sizes of germinal centers. This was likely a result of the immune response to the vaccines. Either vaccine virus replicated preferentially in secondary lymphoid organs and to a lesser extent in epithelium-rich tissues (e.g., intestine, urinary bladder and trachea) and the liver. At the expected peak of viremia, viral RNA was detected in some biological fluid samples from few animals immunized with either vaccine, but none of these samples contained infectious virus. In conclusion, no shedding of infectious viral particles was identified in cynomolgus monkeys after injection of MV1-F4 or Schwarz measles vaccines. Furthermore, no toxic effect in relation to the MV vaccination was found with these vaccines in this study.","Lorin, Clarisse; Segal, Lawrence; Mols, Johann; Morelle, Danielle; Bourguignon, Patricia; Rovira, Olga; Mettens, Pascal; Silvano, Jérémy; Dumey, Nicolas; Le Goff, Frédérick; Koutsoukos, Marguerite; Voss, Gerald; Tangy, Frédéric",Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,142,1
999,999,999,Severe Childhood Malaria Syndromes Defined by Plasma Proteome Profiles,13.535156,7.638979,2012-12-04,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral malaria (CM) and severe malarial anemia (SMA) are the most serious life-threatening clinical syndromes of Plasmodium falciparum infection in childhood. Therefore it is important to understand the pathology underlying the development of CM and SMA, as opposed to uncomplicated malaria (UM). Different host responses to infection are likely to be reflected in plasma proteome-patterns that associate with clinical status and therefore provide indicators of the pathogenesis of these syndromes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Plasma and comprehensive clinical data for discovery and validation cohorts were obtained as part of a prospective case-control study of severe childhood malaria at the main tertiary hospital of the city of Ibadan, an urban and densely populated holoendemic malaria area in Nigeria. A total of 946 children participated in this study. Plasma was subjected to high-throughput proteomic profiling. Statistical pattern-recognition methods were used to find proteome-patterns that defined disease groups. Plasma proteome-patterns accurately distinguished children with CM and with SMA from those with UM, and from healthy or severely ill malaria-negative children. CONCLUSIONS: We report that an accurate definition of the major childhood malaria syndromes can be achieved using plasma proteome-patterns. Our proteomic data can be exploited to understand the pathogenesis of the different childhood severe malaria syndromes.","Burté, Florence; Brown, Biobele J.; Orimadegun, Adebola E.; Ajetunmobi, Wasiu A.; Battaglia, Francesca; Ely, Barry K.; Afolabi, Nathaniel K.; Athanasakis, Dimitrios; Akinkunmi, Francis; Kowobari, Olayinka; Omokhodion, Samuel; Osinusi, Kikelomo; Akinbami, Felix O.; Shokunbi, Wuraola A.; Sodeinde, Olugbemiro; Fernandez-Reyes, Delmiro",PLoS One,142,1
1097,1097,1097,Molecular Profiling of Multiple Human Cancers Defines an Inflammatory Cancer-Associated Molecular Pattern and Uncovers KPNA2 as a Uniform Poor Prognostic Cancer Marker,13.684877,7.586828,2013-03-25,"BACKGROUND: Immune evasion is one of the recognized hallmarks of cancer. Inflammatory responses to cancer can also contribute directly to oncogenesis. Since the immune system is hardwired to protect the host, there is a possibility that cancers, regardless of their histological origins, endow themselves with a common and shared inflammatory cancer-associated molecular pattern (iCAMP) to promote oncoinflammation. However, the definition of iCAMP has not been conceptually and experimentally investigated. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Genome-wide cDNA expression data was analyzed for 221 normal and 324 cancer specimens from 7 cancer types: breast, prostate, lung, colon, gastric, oral and pancreatic. A total of 96 inflammatory genes with consistent dysregulation were identified, including 44 up-regulated and 52 down-regulated genes. Protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for some of these genes. The iCAMP contains proteins whose roles in cancer have been implicated and others which are yet to be appreciated. The clinical significance of many iCAMP genes was confirmed in multiple independent cohorts of colon and ovarian cancer patients. In both cases, better prognosis correlated strongly with high CXCL13 and low level of GREM1, LOX, TNFAIP6, CD36, and EDNRA. An “Inflammatory Gene Integrated Score” was further developed from the combination of 18 iCAMP genes in ovarian cancer, which predicted overall survival. Noticeably, as a selective nuclear import protein whose immuno-regulatory function just begins to emerge, karyopherin alpha 2 (KPNA2) is uniformly up-regulated across cancer types. For the first time, the cancer-specific up-regulation of KPNA2 and its clinical significance were verified by tissue microarray analysis in colon and head-neck cancers. CONCLUSION: This work defines an inflammatory signature shared by seven epithelial cancer types and KPNA2 as a consistently up-regulated protein in cancer. Identification of iCAMP may not only serve as a novel biomarker for prognostication and individualized treatment of cancer, but also have significant biological implications.","Rachidi, Saleh M.; Qin, Tingting; Sun, Shaoli; Zheng, W.

1125,1125,1125,A Study of the Mechanism of the Chaperone-like Function of an scFv of Human Creatine Kinase by Computer Simulation,13.733328,7.773216,2013-04-24,"A new application of antibodies is to use them as macromolecular chaperones. Protein antigens usually have multiple epitopes, thus, there may be a plurality of antibodies binding to one antigen. However, not all antibodies that bind to one antigen could act as a chaperone. Experiments show that some screened anti-human creatine kinase single chain antibodies (scFV) could assist in the folding and stabilizing of the enzyme, while others could not. We built the model of the single chain antibody (scFv-A4) that increased the stability of human creatine kinase (HCK) by the homology modeling method. Epitopes of human creatine kinase were predicted by computer and then the binding of scFv-A4 and HCK was modeled with computer. The calculation results were further combined with the peptide array membrane experiment results to obtain reliable models for the scFv-A4-HCK complex. Based on the above study we gave an explanation about how scFv-A4 could act as a macromolecular chaperone assisting the folding of HCK. This study provides an approach for predicting antigen-antibody binding mode and also a useful theoretical guidance for the study of antibodies' chaperone-like function.","Feng, Jianyu; Guo, Hong; Li, Sen; Lu, Tun",PLoS One,142,11
1330,1330,1330,Application of an Amine Functionalized Biopolymer in the Colonic Delivery of Glycyrrhizin: A Design and In Vivo Efficacy Study,13.834838,7.2684064,2013-05-18,"In our current study, a newer amine functionalized guar gum derivative was studied for its efficacy in colonic drug delivery. Glycyrrhizic acid mono-ammonium salt was used as the model drug. Drug-loaded microparticles were formulated by ionic crosslinking using sodium tripolyphosphate. The Scanning Electron Microscopic study revealed spherical particles of sizes from 4.9 ± 3.8 μm to 6.9 ± 3.9 μm. The FT-IR studies presented a possible interaction between the drug and the polymer. The drug was encapsulated in amorphous form as observed from the powder X-Ray Diffraction studies. A cumulative drug release study was carried out in simulated gastric, intestinal, and colonic fluids. The cumulative drug release studies presented a burst release followed by a sustained release of the drug in simulated colonic fluid containing rat cecal contents. The drug-polymer ratio was optimised using a 3(2) factorial design by taking the amounts of glycyrrhizic acid (X(1)) and guar gum alkyl amine (X(2)) as the independant variables. The percent cumulative drug release at 240 mins (Q(240)), 720 mins (Q(720)), and at 1,440 mins (Q(1440)) were considered as the dependant variables. The efficacy of the optimized formulation was studied in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced rat colitis model. The tissue’s nitric oxide, malondialdehyde, and myeloperoxidase activities were found to be much lower in the microparticle-treated group compared to free drug-treated group. The histology of the colonic tissue from the treated group of animals revealed almost no infiltration of inflammatory cells in the tissue for the microparticle-treated group of animals. The synthesized amine derivative of guar gum was found to be better in vitro with a better in vivo efficacy in the colonic delivery of glycyrrhizic acid monoammonium salt and can be considered as a newer modified biopolymer for colonic drug delivery.","Kumar De, Amit; Datta, Sriparna; Mukherjee, Arup",Sci Pharm,142,1
1370,1370,1370,Potential role of viruses in white plague coral disease,13.485562,7.3009543,2013-08-15,"White plague (WP)-like diseases of tropical corals are implicated in reef decline worldwide, although their etiological cause is generally unknown. Studies thus far have focused on bacterial or eukaryotic pathogens as the source of these diseases; no studies have examined the role of viruses. Using a combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and 454 pyrosequencing, we compared 24 viral metagenomes generated from Montastraea annularis corals showing signs of WP-like disease and/or bleaching, control conspecific corals, and adjacent seawater. TEM was used for visual inspection of diseased coral tissue. No bacteria were visually identified within diseased coral tissues, but viral particles and sequence similarities to eukaryotic circular Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA viruses and their associated satellites (SCSDVs) were abundant in WP diseased tissues. In contrast, sequence similarities to SCSDVs were not found in any healthy coral tissues, suggesting SCSDVs might have a role in WP disease. Furthermore, Herpesviridae gene signatures dominated healthy tissues, corroborating reports that herpes-like viruses infect all corals. Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus (NCLDV) sequences, similar to those recently identified in cultures of Symbiodinium (the algal symbionts of corals), were most common in bleached corals. This finding further implicates that these NCLDV viruses may have a role in bleaching, as suggested in previous studies. This study determined that a specific group of viruses is associated with diseased Caribbean corals and highlights the potential for viral disease in regional coral reef decline.","Soffer, Nitzan; Brandt, Marilyn E; Correa, Adrienne MS; Smith, Tyler B; Thurber, Rebecca Vega",The ISME Journal,142,17

The purpose of this pilot study is to determine whether protein profiling in NTD-mothers differ from normal controls using SELDI-TOF-MS. ProteinChip Biomarker System was used to evaluate 82 maternal serum samples, 78 urine samples and 76 amniotic fluid samples. The validity of classification tree was then challenged with a blind test set including another 20 NTD-mothers and 18 controls in serum samples, and another 19 NTD-mothers and 17 controls in urine samples, and another 20 NTD-mothers and 17 controls in amniotic fluid samples. Eight proteins detected in serum samples were up-regulated and four proteins were down-regulated in the NTD group. Four proteins detected in urine samples were up-regulated and one protein was down-regulated in the NTD group. Six proteins detected in amniotic fluid samples were up-regulated and one protein was down-regulated in the NTD group. The classification tree for serum samples separated NTDs from healthy individuals, achieving a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 97% in the training set, and achieving a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 97% and a positive predictive value of 95% in the test set.

While there has been a major shift away from d4T use in resource-limited countries, a large number of patients have previously received (or continue to receive) d4T, and many have developed peripheral neuropathy. The identification of genetic predictors of increased risk might suggest novel therapeutic targets for such patients. In AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 384, antiretroviral-naïve patients were randomized to d4T/didanosine (ddI)- or zidovudine/lamivudine-containing regimens. Data from d4T/ddI recipients were analyzed for genome-wide associations (approximately 1 million genetic loci) with new onset distal sensory peripheral neuropathy. Analyses involved 254 patients (49 % White, 34 % Black, 17 % Hispanic), comprising 90 peripheral neuropathy cases (32 grade 1, 35 grade 2, 23 grade 3) and 164 controls. After correcting for multiple comparisons, no polymorphism was consistently associated with neuropathy among all patients, among White, Black, and Hispanic patients analyzed separately, both in genome-wide analyses (threshold, P < 5.0 × 10(−8)) and focused on 46 neuropathy-associated genes (threshold, P < 3.5 × 10(−5)). In the latter analyses, the lowest P values were in KIF1A among Whites (rs10199388, P = 8.4 × 10(−4)), in LITAF among Blacks (rs13333308, P = 6.0 × 10(−6)), and in NEFL among Hispanics (rs17763685, P = 5.6 × 10(−6)).

Various computational methods that have been developed based on the antigen structures and the mimotopes these years narrow the search for experimental validation. These methods can be divided into two categories: antigen structure-based methods and mimotope-based methods. Though new methods of the two kinds have been proposed in these years, they cannot maintain a high degree of satisfaction in various circumstances. In this paper, we proposed a new conformational B-cell epitope prediction method based on antigen preprocessing and mimotopes analysis. The method classifies the antigen surface residues into “epitopes” and “nonepitopes” by six epitope propensity scales, removing the “nonepitopes” and using the preprocessed antigen for epitope prediction based on mimotope sequences. The proposed method gives out the mean F score of 0.42 on the testing dataset. When compared with other publicly available servers by using the testing dataset, the new method yields better performance. The results demonstrate the proposed method is competent for the conformational B-cell epitope prediction.","Sun, Pingping; Ju, Haixu; Zhang, Baowen; Gu, Yu; Liu, Bo; Huang, Yanxin; Zhang, Huijie; Li, Yuxin",Biomed Res Int,142,8

This study aims to investigate the expression and distribution of CFTR in the ganglia of the human gastrointestinal tract. Fresh tissue and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded normal gastrointestinal tract samples were collected from eleven surgical patients and five autopsy cases. Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, laser-assisted microdissection and nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were performed. Expression of CFTR protein and mRNA was detected in neurons of the ganglia of all segments of the human gastrointestinal tract examined, including the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, appendix, colon and rectum. The extensive expression of CFTR in the enteric ganglia suggests that CFTR may play a role in the physiology of the innervation of the gastro-intestinal tract. The presence of dysfunctional CFTRs in enteric ganglia could, to a certain extent, explain the gastrointestinal symptoms frequently experienced by CF patients.","Xue, Ruiqi; Gu, Huan; Qiu, Yamei; Guo, Yong; Korteweg, Christine; Huang, Jin; Gu, Jiang",Sci Rep,142,11

Information on sapovirus infection of wildlife is limited and is currently lacking for any free-ranging wildlife species in Africa. By screening a large number of predominantly fecal samples (n = 631) obtained from five carnivore species in the Serengeti ecosystem, East Africa, sapovirus RNA was detected in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta, family Hyaenidae), African lion (Panthera leo, family Felidae), and bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis, family Canidae), but not in golden or silver-backed jackals (Canis aureus and C. mesomelas, respectively, family Canidae). A phylogenetic analysis based on partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences placed the sapovirus strains from African carnivores in a monophyletic group. Within this monophyletic group, sapovirus strains from spotted hyenas formed one independent sub-group, and those from bat-eared fox and African lion a second sub-group. The percentage nucleotide similarity between sapoviruses from African carnivores and those from other species was low (< 70.4%). Long-term monitoring of sapovirus in a population of individually known spotted hyenas from 2001 to 2012 revealed: i) a relatively high overall infection prevalence (34.8%); ii) the circulation of several genetically diverse variants; iii) large fluctuations in infection prevalence across years, indicative of outbreaks; iv) no significant difference in the likelihood of infection between animals in different age categories. The likelihood of sapovirus infection decreased with increasing hyena group size, suggesting an encounter reduction effect, but was independent of socially mediated ano-genital contact, or the extent of the area over which an individual roamed.","Olarte-Castillo, Ximena A.; Hofer, Heribert; Goller, Katja V.; Martella, Vito; Moehlman, Patricia D.; East, Marion L.",PLoS One,142,17

However, the development of systemically delivered antisense therapeutics has been hampered by poor tissue penetration and cellular uptake, including crossing of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) to reach targets in the central nervous system (CNS). For SMA application, we have investigated the ability of various BBB-crossing peptides for CNS delivery of a splice-switching phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO) targeting survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) exon 7 inclusion. We identified a branched derivative of the well-known ApoE (141–150) peptide, which as a PMO conjugate was capable of exon inclusion in the CNS following systemic administration, leading to an increase in the level of full-length SMN2 transcript. Treatment of newborn SMA mice with this peptide-PMO (P-PMO) conjugate resulted in a significant increase in the average lifespan and gains in weight, muscle strength, and righting reflexes. Systemic treatment of adult SMA mice with this newly identified P-PMO also resulted in small but significant increases in the levels of SMN2 pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) exon inclusion in the CNS and peripheral tissues. This work provides proof of principle for the ability to select new peptide paradigms to enhance CNS delivery and activity of a PMO SSO through use of a peptide-based delivery platform for the treatment of SMA potentially extending to other neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases.","Shabanpoor, Fazel; Hammond, Suzan M; Abendroth, Frank; Hazell, Gareth; Wood, Matthew J.A.; Gait, Michael J.",Nucleic Acid Ther,142,1

To date >70 chemical compounds have been isolated from Cassiae semen, and the major components have been determined to be anthraquinones, naphthopyrones and volatile oil. The crude extracts and pure compounds of Cassiae semen have been used as effective agents in preclinical and clinical practice due to their beneficial activities, including antihyperlipidemic, antidiabetic, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, antibacterial, antioxidant and hypotensive activities. With the body of reported data, it has been suggested that Cassiae semen has convincing medicinal potential. However, the pharmacological mechanisms of the main bioactive compounds and the association between structure and activity require further investigation.","Dong, Xiaoxv; Fu, Jing; Yin, Xingbin; Yang, Chunjing; Zhang, Xin; Wang, Wenping; Du, Xueying; Wang, Qingling; Ni, Jian",Mol Med Rep,142,22

The early parasite detection is one of the effective means to prevent severe malaria of which specific treatment strategies are limited. Many clinical characteristics and laboratory testings have been used for the early diagnosis and prediction of severe disease. However, a few of these factors could be applied to clinical practice. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were demonstrated as useful biomarkers in many diseases such as malignant diseases and cardiovascular diseases. Recently it was found that plasma miR-451 and miR-16 were downregulated in malaria infection at parasitic stages or with multi-organ failure involvement. MiR-125b, -27a, -23a, -150, 17–92 and -24 are deregulated in malaria patients with multiple organ failures. Here, the current findings of miRNAs were reviewed in relation to clinical severity of malaria infection and emphasized that miRNAs are potential biomarkers for severe malaria infection.","Chamnanchanunt, Supat; Fucharoen, Suthat; Umemura, Tsukuru",Malar J,142,1

IFN-λ4, a recent member of this family is expressed only in a subset of the population due to a frameshift-causing DNA polymorphism rs368234815. We examined the association of this polymorphism with atopy (aeroallergen sensitization) and asthma in a Polish hospital-based case-control cohort comprising of well-characterized adult asthmatics (n = 326) and healthy controls (n = 111). In the combined cohort, we saw no association of the polymorphism with asthma and/or atopy. However, the IFN-λ4-generating ΔG allele protected older asthmatic women (>50 yr of age) from atopic sensitization. Further, ΔG allele significantly associated with features of less-severe asthma including bronchodilator response and corticosteroid usage in older women in this Polish cohort. We tested the association of related IFNL locus polymorphisms (rs12979860 and rs8099917) with atopy, allergic rhinitis and presence/absence of asthma in three population-based cohorts from Europe, but saw no significant association of the polymorphisms with any of the phenotypes in older women. The polymorphisms associated marginally with lower occurrence of asthma in men/older men after meta-analysis of data from all cohorts. Functional and well-designed replication studies may reveal the true positive nature of these results.","Chinnaswamy, Sreedhar; Wardzynska, Aleksandra; Pawelczyk, Malgorzata; Makowska, Joanna; Skaaby, Tea; Mercader, Josep M.; Ahluwalia, Tarunveer S.; Grarup, Niels; Guindo-Martinez, Marta; Bisgaard, Hans; Torrents, David; Linneberg, Allan; Bønnelykke, Klaus; Kowalski, Marek L.",Sci Rep,142,1

3356,3356,3356,Elevated serum LAMC2 is associated with lymph node metastasis and predicts poor prognosis in penile squamous cell carcinoma,13.9809065,7.4365478,2018-08-28,"PURPOSE: Molecular biomarkers, especially serologic factors, have been widely applied in cancer diagnosis and patient follow-up. However, there are few valuable prognostic factors in penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC). Here, the authors investigated whether laminin gamma 2 (LAMC2) expression, especially serum LAMC2 (sLAMC2) level, was a suitable prognostic factor that could aid in the prediction of survival in PSCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 114 PSCC patients. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were performed to detect LAMC2 expression; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to test sLAMC2 concentration; and a Transwell assay and an in vivo experiment in nude mice were used to test PSCC cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. The chi-squared test was used to analyze the association between LAMC2 level and clinical parameters, the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the hazard ratio for death, and Kaplan–Meier analysis with a log-rank test was used for the survival analysis. RESULTS: LAMC2 was overexpressed in PSCC tissues, and the LAMC2 expression level was higher in metastatic lymph node (LN) tissues than in primary cancer tissues; moreover, the LAMC2 levels in primary cancer tissues and sLAMC2 were higher in patients with LN metastasis than in those without LN metastasis. Upregulated LAMC2 facilitated the migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of PSCC cells in vitro and promoted LN metastasis of PSCC cells in nude mice. Elevated LAMC2 levels were strongly correlated with advanced clinicopathologic parameters, especially LN metastasis, in PSCC patients and predicted shorter disease-specific survival. The predictive value of sLAMC2 is superior to that of C-reactive protein and squamous cell carcinoma antigen previously reported in PSCC patients, and a stratification analysis revealed that the level of sLAMC2 had a higher predictive value for disease-specific survival in early penile cancer (especially at the N(0/X) stage) than in later-stage penile cancer. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that sLAMC2 is a potential serologic prognostic marker in PSCC and could aid in risk stratification in early-stage PSCC patients.","Zhou, Qiang-Hua; Deng, Chuang-Zhong; Chen, Jie-Ping; Huang, Kang-Bo; Liu, Ting-Yu; Yao, Kai; Liu, Zhuo-Wei; Qin, Zi-Ke; Li, Yong-Hong; Guo, Sheng-Jie; Ye, Yun-Lin; Zhou, Fang-Jian; Huang, Wenlin; Liu, Ran-Yi; Han, Hui",Cancer Manag Res,142,8

METHODS: Nine hundred and twenty Chinese children and adolescents (8 to 16 years) underwent graded cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill until volitional exhaustion. Peak VO(2) was corrected for the effects of body mass by ratio or allometric scaling. Z score equations for predicting peak VO(2) were developed. Correlations between scaled peak VO(2), z scores, body size and age were tested to examine the effectiveness of the approach. RESULTS: Eight hundred and fifty-two participants (48% male) were included in the analyses. Absolute peak VO(2) significantly increased with age in both sexes (both P<0.05), while ratio-scaled peak VO(2) increased only in males (P<0.05). Allometrically scaled peak VO(2) increased from 11 years in both sexes, plateauing by 12 years in girls and continuing to rise until 15 years in boys. Allometically scaled peak VO(2) was not correlated with body mass, but remained correlated with height and age in all but the older girls. Peak VO(2) z score was not correlated with body mass, height or age. CONCLUSIONS: Absolute and allometric scaled peak VO(2) values are provided for Hong Kong Chinese children and adolescents by age and sex. Peak VO(2) z scores improve the evaluation of cardiopulmonary fitness, allowing comparisons across ages and sex and will likely provide a better metric for tracking change over time in children and adolescents, regardless of body size and age.","Yu, Clare C.

3818,3818,3818,Influence of gene modification in biological behaviors and responses of mouse lung telocytes to inflammation,13.788413,7.6403375,2019-05-15,"BACKGROUND: Telocytes play key roles in maintenance of organ/tissue function and prevention of organ injury. However, there are great challenges to investigate telocytes functions using primary telocytes, due to the difficulties of isolation, identification, and stability. The present study aims at constructing continuous cell strain of mouse lung telocyte cell line with stable characters by gene modification and investigating biological behaviors and responses of gene-modified telocytes to inflammation. METHODS: Mouse primary lung telocytes were isolated and identified using immune-labeling markers and immunoelectron microscopy. Primary telocytes were transformed with Simian vacuolating virus 40 small and large T antigen (SV40). Biological characters, behaviors morphology, and proliferation of those gene-modified telocytes were defined and monitored dynamically for 50 generations, as compared with primary lung telocytes. Cell cycle of mouse primary lung telocytes or gene-modified telocytes was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Gene modified telocytes of generations 5, 10, 30 and 50 were observed with telopodes and also showed CD34 and ckit positive. Multiple cellular morphology were also observed on telocyte cell-line under monitor of celliq and enhanced cell proliferation were showed. SV40 transduction was also reduced apoptosis and increased the ratio of S and G2 phases in telocyte cell-line. CONCLUSION: We successfully constructed mouse lung telocyte cell-line which maintained the biological properties and behaviors as primary telocytes and could responses to inflammation induced by LPS. Thus, gene-modified lung telocytes, Telocyte Line, would provide a cell tool for researchers exploring the roles and applications of telocytes involved in physiological and pathological states in future.

3840,3840,3840,Immunomodulatory Effect after Irreversible Electroporation in Patients with Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer,13.94793,7.647553,2019-05-12,"PURPOSE: Irreversible electroporation (IRE) has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective method for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect after IRE and to evaluate the prognostic value of variations of the immune parameters in LAPC patients after IRE. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples of 34 patients were obtained preoperatively and on the third day (D3) and seventh day (D7) after IRE, respectively. The phenotypes of lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry, and dynamic changes of serum levels of cytokines, complement, and immunoglobulin were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and concordance index (C-index) were used to compare the survival predictive ability. RESULTS: There was a transitory decrease followed by a steady increase for CD4(+) T cell, CD8(+) T cell, NK cell, IL-2, C3, C4, and IgG while a reverse trend was detected for Treg cell, IL-6, and IL10 after IRE. The alteration of CD8(+) T cell between D3 and D7 was identified as a prognostic factor for both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The values of ROC curve (AUC) and C-indexes of the alteration of CD8(+) T cell for OS and PFS were 0.816 and 0.773 and 0.816 and 0.639, respectively, which were larger than those of other immune or inflammation-based indexes. CONCLUSIONS: This study presented the first evidence of IRE-based immunomodulatory in patients with LAPC. The alteration of CD8(+) T cell between D3 and D7 showed relatively good performance and could be used as an effective tool for prognostic evaluation for LAPC patients after IRE.","He, Chaobin; Wang, Jun; Sun, Shuxin; Zhang, Yu; Li, Shengping",J Oncol,142,1
4048,4048,4048,Co-delivery of glycyrrhizin and doxorubicin by alginate nanogel particles attenuates the activation of macrophage and enhances the therapeutic efficacy for hepatocellular carcinoma,13.55811,7.338037,2019-08-14,"Nanocarrier drug delivery systems (NDDS) have been paid more attention over conventional drug delivery system for cancer therapy. However, the efficacy is hampered by the fast clearance of activated macrophage from the blood circulation system. In this study, glycyrrhizin (GL) was introduced into alginate (ALG) nanogel particles (NGPs) to construct multifunctional delivery vehicle to decrease the fast clearance of activated macrophage and enhance the anticancer efficacy with the combination therapy of GL and doxorubicin (DOX). Methods: We firstly synthesized the GL-ALG NGPs with intermolecular hydrogen bond and ionic bond as the multifunctional delivery vehicle. The immune response and phagocytosis of macrophage on GL-ALG NGPs were investigated on RAW 264.7 macrophages. The pharmacokinetic study of DOX loaded in GL-ALG NGPs was performed in rats. The active targeting effects of GL-ALG NGPs were further studied on hepatocellular carcinoma cell (HepG2) and H22 tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, the anticancer molecular mechanism of DOX/GL-ALG NGPs was investigated on HepG2 cells in vitro and tumor-bearing mice in vivo. Results: GL-ALG NGPs could not only avoid triggering the immuno-inflammatory responses of macrophages but also decreasing the phagocytosis of macrophage. The bioavailability of DOX was increased about 13.2 times by DOX/GL-ALG NGPs than free DOX in blood. The mice with normal immune functions used in constructing the tumor-bearing mice instead of the nude mouse also indicated the good biocompatibility of NGPs. GL-mediated ALG NGPs exhibited excellent hepatocellular carcinoma targeting effect in vitro and in vivo. The results suggested that the anticancer molecular mechanism of the combination therapy of glycyrrhizin and doxorubicin in ALG NGPs was performed via regulating apoptosis pathway of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity, which was also verified in H22 tumor-bearing mice. Conclusion: DOX/GL-ALG NGPs could attenuate the activation of macrophage and enhance the therapeutic efficacy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Our results suggest that the combination therapy would provide a new strategy for liver cancer treatment.","Wang, Qiang-Song; Gao, Li-Na; Zhu, Xiao-Ning; Zhang, Yan; Zhang, Chuang-Nian; Xu, Dong; Cui, Yuan-Lu",Theranostics,142,1

4225,4225,4225,A review on the eco-epidemiology and clinical management of human granulocytic anaplasmosis and its agent in Europe,13.745823,7.6792154,2019-12-21,"Anaplasma phagocytophilum is the agent of tick-borne fever, equine, canine and human granulocytic anaplasmosis. The common route of A. phagocytophilum transmission is through a tick bite, the main vector in Europe being Ixodes ricinus. Despite the apparently ubiquitous presence of the pathogen A. phagocytophilum in ticks and various wild and domestic animals from Europe, up to date published clinical cases of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) remain rare compared to the worldwide status. It is unclear if this reflects the epidemiological dynamics of the human infection in Europe or if the disease is underdiagnosed or underreported. Epidemiologic studies in Europe have suggested an increased occupational risk of infection for forestry workers, hunters, veterinarians, and farmers with a tick-bite history and living in endemic areas. Although the overall genetic diversity of A. phagocytophilum in Europe is higher than in the USA, the strains responsible for the human infections are related on both continents. However, the study of the genetic variability and assessment of the difference of pathogenicity and infectivity between strains to various hosts has been insufficiently explored to date. Most of the European HGA cases presented as a mild infection, common clinical signs being pyrexia, headache, myalgia and arthralgia. The diagnosis of HGA in the USA was recommended to be based on clinical signs and the patient’s history and later confirmed using specialized laboratory tests. However, in Europe since the majority of cases are presenting as mild infection, laboratory tests may be performed before the treatment in order to avoid antibiotic overuse. The drug of choice for HGA is doxycycline and because of potential for serious complication the treatment should be instituted on clinical suspicion alone.","Matei, Ioana A.; Estrada-Peña, Agustín; Cutler, Sally J.; Vayssier-Taussat, Muriel; Varela-Castro, Lucía; Potkonjak, Aleksandar; Zeller, Herve; Mihalca, Andrei D.",Parasit Vectors,142,11

The present study investigated the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of TCs in a mouse model of respiratory distress. METHODS: The mouse model of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was established by intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). After instillation of TCs culture medium, lung injury was assessed, and angiogenesis markers, including CD31 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), were detected by immunofluorescence. Bioinformatics analysis was used to screen significantly differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in cultured TCs stimulated with LPS, and the regulation of downstream angiogenesis genes by these miRNAs was analysed and verified. PI3K subunits and pathways were evaluated by using a PI3K p110α inhibitor to study the involved mechanisms. RESULTS: In ARDS mice, instillation of TCs culture medium ameliorated LPS-induced inflammation and lung injury and increased the protein levels of CD31 and eNOS in the injured lungs. A total of 7 miRNAs and 1899 mRNAs were differentially regulated in TCs stimulated with LPS. Functional prediction analysis showed that the differentially expressed mRNAs were enriched in angiogenesis-related processes, which were highly correlated with miR-21a-3p. Culture medium from TCs with miR-21a-3p inhibition failed to promote angiogenesis in mouse models of LPS-induced ARDS. In cultured TCs, LPS stimulation upregulated the expression of miR-21a-3p, which further targeted the transcription factor E2F8 and decreased Notch2 protein expression. TCs culture medium enhanced hemangioendothelioma endothelial cells (EOMA cells) proliferation, which was blocked by the miR-21a-3p inhibitor. The PI3K p110α inhibitor decreased vascular endothelial growth factor levels in LPS-stimulated TCs and reversed the enhancing effect of TCs culture medium on EOMA cells proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: TCs exerted protective effects under inflammatory conditions by promoting angiogenesis via miR-21a-3p. The PI3K p110α subunit and transcriptional factor E2F8 could be involved in this process.","Zhou, Yile; Yang, Yajie; Liang, Tao; Hu, Yan; Tang, Haihong; Song, Dongli; Fang, Hao",J Transl Med,142,22

TUNEL labeling was absent from both microglia and perivascular cells at all time points investigated. Indirect evidence is presented that microglia may transfer myelin degradation products to the perivascular space.

In this work, the informational content of overlapping genes belonging to prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses was analyzed. Using information theory indices, we identified in the regions of overlap a first pattern, exhibiting a more uniform base composition and more severe constraints in base ordering with respect to the nonoverlapping regions. This pattern was found to be peculiar to coliphage, avian hepatitis B virus, human lentivirus, and plant luteovirus families. A second pattern, characterized by the occurrence of similar compositional constraints in both types of coding regions, was found to be limited to plant tymoviruses. At the level of codon usage, a low degree of correlation between overlapping and nonoverlapping coding regions characterized the first pattern, whereas a close link was found in tymoviruses, indicating a fine adaptation of the overlapping frame to the original codon choice of the virus. As a result of codon usage correlation analysis, deductions concerning the origin and evolution of several overlapping frames were also proposed. Comparison of amino acid composition revealed an increased frequency of amino acid residues with a high level of degeneracy (arginine, leucine, and serine) in the proteins encoded by overlapping genes; this peculiar feature of overlapping genes can be viewed as a way with which they may expand their coding ability and gain new, specialized functions.","Pavesi, Angelo; De Iaco, Bettina; Granero, Maria Ilde; Porati, Alfredo",J Mol Evol,142,1

In this context alveolar macrophage interleukin-8 secretion, phagocyte oxidative response and concentrations of lavage proteins were quantified, including interleukin-8, in 31 patients with pneumonia, 13 age matched patients with peripheral lung consolidation and six healthy volunteers; these findings were related to the impairment of gas exchange and the bacterial load in the alveolar space. Increased interleukin-8 levels were found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and in alveolar macrophage supernatants from patients with pneumonia (214 ng/10(5) AM±121 vs 71 ng/10(5) AM±35 and 66 ng/10(5) AM±30, p<0.05). Interleukin-8 release from alveolar macrophages correlated with the upregulated spontaneous luminol enhanced oxidative response of pulmonary phagocytes but not with the neutrophil count in BALF. In pneumonia patients a significant difference was found between patients with 10(4) or more colony forming units (CFU)/ml BALF of one pathogen and patients with less CFU or nonspecific microbiological results (261 ng/10(5) AM±89 vs 179 ng/10(5) AM±81 and 7.5 ng/ml BALF±17 vs 0.44 ng/ml BALF±1, p<0.05). Further, a negative correlation between interleukin-8 release of alveolar macrophages and the arterial pO(2) at the time of BALF could be demonstrated (r=−0.47, p<0.05). The results demonstrate local cellular activation in community-acquired pneumonia, which is related to the bacterial load in the alveolar space and to impairment of gas exchange.

RESULTS: The IL-8 expression at both protein and mRNA levels was found to be significantly elevated in asthmatic children compared to healthy subjects (P < 0.0001, P = 0.004; respectively). Higher levels of IL-8 mRNA are detected in subjects with moderate to severe asthma. The presence of IL8-251 A/T (rs4073) and + 781C/T (rs2227306) polymorphisms was significantly associated with an increased risk of asthma (P = 0.002, P = 0.036, respectively). In addition, we noted a significant association between these polymorphisms and an elevated risk of atopic asthma (P < 0.05). For rs2227306 SNP, the highest median level of IgE was detected for the presence of TT genotype (865 ± 99.74 IU/mL). Although, the rs4073 polymorphism conferred a higher risk to develop asthma at an advanced stage of severity (P = 0.008). The rs4073 T and rs2227306 C alleles are considered as risk factors for asthma development. The rs4073 T allele is represented also as a risk factor for asthma severity in Tunisian children. CONCLUSIONS: Both IL-8 gene and protein expression may play a key role in asthma pathogenesis.

Single vessel involvement or multiple vascular occlusions may give rise to a wide variety of presentations. Any combination of vascular occlusive events may occur in the same individual and the time interval between them also varies considerably from weeks to months or even years. Deep vein thrombosis, sometimes accompanied by pulmonary embolism, is the most frequently reported manifestation in this syndrome. Cerebrovascular accidents—either stroke or transient ischemic attacks—are the most common arterial thrombotic manifestations. Early and late fetal losses, premature births and pre-eclampsia are the most frequent fetal and obstetric manifestations. Additionally, several other clinical features are relatively common in these patients, i.e., thrombocytopenia, livedo reticularis, heart valve lesions, hemolytic anemia, epilepsy, myocardial infarction, leg ulcers, and amaurosis fugax. However, a large variety of other clinical manifestations have been less frequently described in patients with the APS, with prevalences lower than 5%. These include, among others, large peripheral or aortic artery occlusions, Sneddon's syndrome, chorea, transverse myelopathy, intracardiac thrombus, adult respiratory distress syndrome, renal thrombotic microangiopathy, Addison's syndrome, Budd-Chiari syndrome, nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver, avascular necrosis of the bone, cutaneous necrosis or subungual splinter hemorrhages.

Chest X-ray features of 300 consecutive patients who had undergone 333 liver transplants over an 11-year period were analysed: the type of pulmonary complication, the infecting pathogens and the mean time of their occurrence are described. The main risk factors for lung infections were quantified through univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. Non-infectious pulmonary abnormalities (atelectasis and/or pleural effusion: 86.7 %) and pulmonary oedema (44.7 %) appeared during the first postoperative week. Infectious pneumonia was observed in 13.7 %, with a mortality of 36.6 %. Bacterial and viral pneumonia made up the bulk of infections (63.4 and 29.3 %, respectively) followed by fungal infiltrates (24.4 %). A fairly good correlation between radiological chest X-ray pattern, time of onset and the cultured microorganisms has been observed in all cases. In multivariate analysis, persistent non-infectious abnormalities and pulmonary oedema were identified as the major independent predictors of posttransplant pneumonia, followed by prolonged assisted mechanical ventilation and traditional caval anastomosis. A “pneumonia-risk score” was calculated: low-risk score ( < 2.25) predicts 2.7 % of probability of the onset of infections compared with 28.7 % of high-risk ( > 3.30) population. The “pneumonia-risk score” identifies a specific group of patients in whom closer radiographic monitoring is recommended. In addition, a highly significant correlation (p < 0.001) was observed between pneumonia-risk score and the expected survival, thus confirming pulmonary infections as a major cause of death in OLT recipients.","Golfieri, R.; Giampalma, E.; Morselli Labate, A.

Mean age was 41.48 months. Male to female ratio was 2.95:1. Mean PRISM III score on admission was 18.50. Diagnoses included respiratory (19.7%), cardiac (9.7%), neurological (17.9%), infectious (12.5%), trauma (11.7%), other surgical (8.8%).196 children (20.68%) required mechanical ventilation. Average duration of ventilation was 6.39 days. 27 children (30.7 children /1000 admissions) had acute respiratory distress syndrome. Gross mortality was 6.7% (59 patients). PRISMIII adjusted mortality was directly proportional to PRISMIII scores. 49.5% of nonsurvivors had multiorgan failure. Average length of PICU stay was 4.52 +/−2.6 days.

If we can obtain satisfactory prediction using only nucleotide (sequence) information, it would be more promising. Three groups recently identified essential genes in human cancer cell lines using wet experiments and it provided wonderful opportunity to accomplish our idea. Here we improved the Z curve method into the λ-interval form to denote nucleotide composition and association information and used it to construct the SVM classifying model. RESULTS: Our model accurately predicted human gene essentiality with an AUC higher than 0.88 both for 5-fold cross-validation and jackknife tests. These results demonstrated that the essentiality of human genes could be reliably reflected by only sequence information. We re-predicted the negative dataset by our Pheg server and 118 genes were additionally predicted as essential. Among them, 20 were found to be homologues in mouse essential genes, indicating that some of the 118 genes were indeed essential, however previous experiments overlooked them. As the first available server, Pheg could predict essentiality for anonymous gene sequences of human. It is also hoped the λ-interval Z curve method could be effectively extended to classification issues of other DNA elements.

While scientifically metagenomic analysis was established before the start of the era of high-throughput sequencing, the availability of the first second-generation sequencers was the kick-off for diagnosticians to use sequencing for the detection of novel pathogens. Today, diagnostic metagenomics is becoming the standard procedure for the detection and genetic characterization of new viruses or novel virus variants.

Templates, designed through expert agreement, are valuable and feasible, but they need to be updated on a regular basis due to developments in available equipment and treatment options. In 2011, a consensus-based template documenting and reporting data in p-EMS was published. We aimed to revise and update the template for documenting and reporting in p-EMS. METHODS: A Delphi method was applied to achieve a consensus from a panel of selected European experts. The experts were blinded to each other until a consensus was reached, and all responses were anonymized. The experts were asked to propose variables within five predefined sections. There was also an optional sixth section for variables that did not fit into the pre-defined sections. Experts were asked to review and rate all variables from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree) based on relevance, and consensus was defined as variables rated ≥4 by more than 70% of the experts. RESULTS: Eleven experts participated. The experts generated 194 unique variables in the first round. After five rounds, a consensus was reached. The updated dataset was an expanded version of the original dataset and the template was expanded from 45 to 73 main variables. The experts approved the final version of the template. CONCLUSIONS: Using a Delphi method, we have updated the template for documenting and reporting in p-EMS. We recommend implementing the dataset for standard reporting in p-EMS.","Tønsager, Kristin; Krüger, Andreas Jørstad; Ringdal, Kjetil Gorseth; Rehn, Marius",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,142,1

The scoring functionality that evaluates the fitness of the docking result is one of the major challenges in virtual screening. In general, scoring functionality in docking requires a large amount of floating-point calculations, which usually takes several weeks or even months to be finished. This time-consuming procedure is unacceptable, especially when highly fatal and infectious virus arises such as SARS and H1N1, which forces the scoring task to be done in a limited time. This paper presents how to leverage the computational power of GPU to accelerate Dock6’s (http://dock.compbio.ucsf.edu/DOCK_6/) Amber (J. Comput. Chem. 25: 1157–1174, 2004) scoring with NVIDIA CUDA (NVIDIA Corporation Technical Staff, Compute Unified Device Architecture – Programming Guide, NVIDIA Corporation, 2008) (Compute Unified Device Architecture) platform. We also discuss many factors that will greatly influence the performance after porting the Amber scoring to GPU, including thread management, data transfer, and divergence hidden. Our experiments show that the GPU-accelerated Amber scoring achieves a 6.5× speedup with respect to the original version running on AMD dual-core CPU for the same problem size. This acceleration makes the Amber scoring more competitive and efficient for large-scale virtual screening problems.","Yang, Hailong; Zhou, Qiongqiong; Li, Bo; Wang, Yongjian; Luan, Zhongzhi; Qian, Depei; Li, Hanlu",Advances in Computational Biology,142,1

In retroviruses, synthesis of pol gene products necessitates either readthrough of a stop codon or frameshifting. Here we present an experimental system that permits quantification of translational errors in vivo. It consists of a family of expression vectors carrying different mutated versions of the luc gene as reporter. Mutations include both an in-frame stop codon and 1-base-pair deletions that require readthough or frameshift, respectively, to give rise to an active product. This system is sensitive enough to detect background errors in mammalian cells. In addition, one of the vectors contains two unique cloning sites that make it possible to insert any sequence of interest. This latter vector was used to analyse the effect of a DNA fragment, proposed to be the target of high level slippage at the gag-pol junction of HIV. The effect of paromomycin and kasugamycin, two antibiotics known to influence translational ambiguity, was also tested in cultured cells. The results indicate that paromomycin diversely affects readthrough and frameshifting, while kasugamycin had no effect.

The pathogen is present in very high levels within infected plants and can be transmitted by a broad range of mechanisms; therefore early specific detection is vital for effective disease management. In this study, a polyclonal antibody (pAb) was developed and deployed in a lateral flow device (LFD) format to allow rapid in‐field detection of Xcm. Published Xcm PCR assays were also independently assessed: only two assays gave specific amplification of Xcm, whilst others cross‐reacted with non‐target Xanthomonas species. Pure cultures of Xcm were used to immunize a rabbit, the IgG antibodies purified from the serum and the resulting polyclonal antibodies tested using ELISA and LFD. Testing against a wide range of bacterial species showed the pAb detected all strains of Xcm, representing isolates from seven countries and the known genetic diversity of Xcm. The pAb also detected the closely related Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vasculorum (Xav), primarily a sugarcane pathogen. Detection was successful in both naturally and experimentally infected banana plants, and the LFD limit of detection was 10(5) cells mL(−1). Whilst the pAb is not fully specific for Xcm, Xav has never been found in banana. Therefore the LFD can be used as a first‐line screening tool to detect Xcm in the field. Testing by LFD requires no equipment, can be performed by non‐scientists and is cost‐effective. Therefore this LFD provides a vital tool to aid in the management and control of Xcm.","Hodgetts, J.; Karamura, G.; Johnson, G.; Hall, J.; Perkins, K.; Beed, F.; Nakato, V.; Grant, M.; Studholme, D.

In reviewing more recent findings, an attempt is made to fill knowledge gaps and revisit some canonical views of vRNA structures involved in replication. In particular, alternative views are offered on the nature of the flaviviral promoter and genome cyclization, and the feasibility of refining in vitro‐derived models with modern RNA probing and sequencing methods is pointed out.

This study examines the biodiversity of Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) communities in these scarce Afroalpine lake systems, in order to determine their uniqueness in relation to lowland African lakes and alpine lakes in temperate regions, and to evaluate the potential of Afroalpine Chironomidae as biological indicators to monitor future changes in the ecological integrity of their habitat. Location Mount Kenya (Kenya) and Rwenzori Mountains (Uganda). Methods The species composition of Afroalpine chironomid communities was assessed using recent larval death assemblages extracted from the surface sediments of 11 high‐mountain lakes between 2900 and 4575 m. Results were compared with similar faunal data from 68 East African lakes at low and middle elevation (750–2760 m), and with literature records of Chironomidae species distribution in sub‐Saharan Africa, the Palaearctic region and elsewhere. All recovered taxa were fully described and illustrated. Results The 11‐lake analysis yielded 1744 subfossil chironomid larvae belonging to 16 distinct taxa of full‐grown larvae, and three taxa of less differentiated juveniles. Eleven of these 16 are not known to occur in African lakes at lower elevation, and eight taxa (or 50% of total species richness) appear restricted to the specific habitat of cold lakes above 3900 m, where night‐time freezing is frequent year‐round. The faunal transition zone coincides broadly with the Ericaceous zone of terrestrial vegetation (c. 3000–4000 m). Snowline depression during the Quaternary ice ages must have facilitated dispersion of cold‐stenothermous species among the high mountains of equatorial East Africa, but less so from or to the Palaearctic region via the Ethiopian highlands. Main conclusions Chironomid communities in glacier‐fed lakes on Africa's highest mountains are highly distinct from those of lowland African lakes, and potentially unique on a continental scale. By virtue of excellent preservation and their spatial and temporal integration of local community dynamics, chironomid larval death assemblages extracted from surface sediments are powerful biological indicators for monitoring the hydrological and ecological changes associated with the current retreat and loss of Africa's glaciers.","Eggermont, Hilde; Verschuren, Dirk",J Biogeogr,142,1

Certain metabolites play a key role in ARDS and could serve as potential targets for developing therapies against this respiratory disorder. The present study was designed to determine such “functional metabolites” in ARDS using metabolomics and in vivo experiments in a mouse model. METHODS: Metabolomic profiles of blood plasma from 42 ARDS patients and 28 healthy controls were captured using Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) assay. Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis were performed on metabolomic profiles from blood plasma of ARDS patients and healthy controls to screen for “functional metabolites”, which were determined by variable importance in projection (VIP) scores and P value. Pathway analysis of all the metabolites was performed. The mouse model of ARDS was established to investigate the role of “functional metabolites” in the lung injury and mortality caused by the respiratory disorder. RESULTS: The metabolomic profiles of patients with ARDS were significantly different from healthy controls, difference was also observed between metabolomic profiles of the non-survivors and the survivors among the ARDS patient pool. Levels of Phenylalanine, D-Phenylalanine and Phenylacetylglutamine were significantly increased in non-survivors compared to the survivors of ARDS. Phenylalanine metabolism was the most notably altered pathway between the non-survivors and survivors of ARDS patients. In vivo animal experiments demonstrated that high levels of Phenylalanine might be associated with the severer lung injury and increased mortality of ARDS. CONCLUSION: Increased mortality of acute respiratory distress syndrome was associated with high levels of plasma Phenylalanine. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR1800015930.

Choleraesuis vaccine candidate strain rSC0011 (ΔP(crp527)::TT araC P(BAD)crp Δpmi-2426 ΔrelA199::araC P(BAD)lacI TT ΔasdA33, Δ, deletion, TT, terminator) delivering SaoA, a conserved surface protein in most of S. suis serotypes, provided excellent protection against S. suis challenge, but occasionally lead to morbidity (enteritidis) in vaccinated mice (approximately 1 in every 10 mice). Thus, alternated attenuation method was sought to reduce the reactogenicity of strain rSC0011. Herein, we described another recombinant attenuated S. Choleraesuis vector, rSC0012 (ΔP(fur88):: TT araC P(BAD)fur Δpmi-2426 ΔrelA199:: araC P(BAD)lacI TT ΔasdA33) with regulated delayed fur mutation to avoid inducing disease symptoms while exhibiting a high degree of immunogenicity. RESULTS: The strain rSC0012 strain with the ΔP(fur88)::TT araC P(BAD)fur mutation induced less production of inflammatory cytokines than strain rSC0011 with the ΔP(crp527)::TT araC P(BAD)crp mutation in mice. When delivering the same pS-SaoA plasmid, the intraperitoneal LD(50) of rSC0012 was 18.2 times higher than that of rSC0011 in 3-week-old BALB/C mice. rSC0012 with either pS-SaoA or pYA3493 was cleared from spleen and liver tissues 7 days earlier than rSC0011 with same vectors after oral inoculation. The strain rSC0012 synthesizing SaoA induced high titers of anti-SaoA antibodies in both systemic (IgG in serum) and mucosal (IgA in vaginal washes) sites, as well as increased level of IL-4, the facilitator of Th2-type T cell immune response in mice. The recombinant vaccine rSC0012(pS-SaoA) conferred high percentage of protection against S. suis or S. Choleraesuis challenge in BALB/C mice. CONCLUSIONS: The live-attenuated Salmonella enterica serotype Choleraesuis vaccine rSC0012(pS-SaoA) with regulated delayed fur mutation provides a foundation for the development of a safe and effective vaccine against S. Choleraesuis and S. suis.","Li, Yu-an; Chen, Yunyun; Du, Yuan zhao; Guo, Weiwei; Chu, Dianfeng; Fan, Juan; Wang, Xiaobo; Bellefleur, Matthew; Wang, Shifeng; Shi, Huoying",BMC Vet Res,142,5

Their ability to predict influenza-related pneumonia, however, is less well-established. METHODS: A total of 693 laboratory-confirmed FluA-p patients diagnosed between Jan 2013 and Dec 2018 and recruited from five teaching hospitals in China were included in the study. The sample included 494 patients in the derivation cohort and 199 patients in the validation cohort. The prediction rule was established based on independent risk factors for 30-day mortality in FluA-p patients from the derivation cohort. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality of FluA-p patients was 19.6% (136/693). The FluA-p score was based on a multivariate logistic regression model designed to predict mortality. Results indicated the following significant predictors (regression statistics and point contributions toward total score in parentheses): blood urea nitrogen > 7 mmol/L (OR 1.604, 95% CI 1.150–4.492, p = 0.040; 1 points), pO(2)/F(i)O(2) ≤ 250 mmHg (OR 2.649, 95% CI 1.103–5.142, p = 0.022; 2 points), cardiovascular disease (OR 3.967, 95% CI 1.269–7.322, p < 0.001; 3 points), arterial PH < 7.35 (OR 3.959, 95% CI 1.393–7.332, p < 0.001; 3 points), smoking history (OR 5.176, 95% CI 2.604–11.838, p = 0.001; 4 points), lymphocytes < 0.8 × 10(9)/L (OR 8.391, 95% CI 3.271–16.212, p < 0.001; 5 points), and early neurominidase inhibitor therapy (OR 0.567, 95% CI 0.202–0.833, p = 0.005; − 2 points). Seven points was used as the cut-off value for mortality risk stratification. The model showed a sensitivity of 0.941, a specificity of 0.762, and overall better predictive performance than the PSI risk class (AUROC = 0.908 vs 0.560, p < 0.001) and the CURB-65 score (AUROC = 0.908 vs 0.777, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that a FluA-p score was easy to derive and that it served as a reliable prediction rule for 30-day mortality in FluA-p patients. The score could also effectively stratify FluA-p patients into relevant risk categories and thereby help treatment providers to make more rational clinical decisions.","Chen, Liang; Han, Xiudi; Li, Yan Li; Zhang, Chunxiao; Xing, Xiqian",Respir Res,142,1

The VP8* protein from the P[4], P[6], P[8], P[9], P[11], P[14] and P[25] genotypes were produced in E. coli. These proteins were tested with 88 serum samples from children (n = 41, 3.5 years old in average) and from adults (n = 47, 58 years old in average) by ELISA. A subset of 55 samples were genotyped for the FUT2(G428A) polymorphism and the antibody titers compared. The same subset of samples was also analysed by ELISA using whole rotavirus Wa particles (G1P[8]) as antigen. Ninety-three per cent of the samples were positive for at least one of the VP8* antigens. Differences in the IgG seroprevalence were found between children and adults for the P[4], P[8] and P[11] genotypes. Similarly, significant differences were found between adults and children in their antibody titers against the P[4], P[8], and P[11] VP8* genotypes, having the children higher antibody titers than adults. Interestingly, positive samples against rare genotypes such as P[11] (only in children), P[14] and P[25] were found. While no statistical differences in the antibody titers between secretors and non-secretors were found for any of the tested P genotypes studied, a higher statistic significant prevalence for the P[25] genotype was found in secretors compared to non-secretors. Significant differences in the antibody titers between secretors and non-secretors were found when the whole viral particles from the Wa rotavirus strain (G1P[8]) were used as the antigen.","Vila-Vicent, Susana; Gozalbo-Rovira, Roberto; Rubio-Del-Campo, Antonio; Santiso-Bellón, Cristina; Navarro-Lleó, Noemí; Muñoz, Carlos; Buesa, Javier; Rodríguez-Díaz, Jesús",Sci Rep,142,11

Obesity, anesthesia, and pneumoperitoneum cause reduced pulmoner functions and a tendency for atelectasis. The alveolar “recruitment” maneuver (RM) keeps airway pressure high, opening alveoli, and increasing arterial oxygenation. The aim of our study is to research the effect on respiratory mechanics and arterial blood gases of performing the RM in LSG surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing LSG surgery were divided into two groups (n = 30) Patients in group R had the RM performed 5 min after desufflation with 100% oxygen, 40 cmH(2)O pressure for 40 s. Group C had standard mechanical ventilation. Assessments of respiratory mechanics and arterial blood gases were made in the 10th min after induction (T1), 10th min after insufflation (T2), 5th min after desufflation (T3), and 15th min after desufflation (T4). Arterial blood gases were assessed in the 30th min (T5) in the postoperative recovery unit. RESULTS: In group R, values at T5, PaO(2) were significantly high, while PaCO(2) were significantly low compared with group C. Compliance in both groups reduced with pneumoperitoneum. At T4, the compliance in the recruitment group was higher. In both groups, there was an increase in PIP with pneumoperitoneum and after desufflation this was identified to reduce to levels before pneumoperitoneum. CONCLUSION: Adding the RM to PEEP administration for morbidly obese patients undergoing LSG surgery is considered to be effective in improving respiratory mechanics and arterial blood gas values and can be used safely.","Sümer, Ismail; Topuz, Ufuk; Alver, Selçuk; Umutoglu, Tarik; Bakan, Mefkur; Zengin, Seniyye Ülgen; Coşkun, Halil; Salihoglu, Ziya",Obes Surg,142,1

In mammals, hair cells lack regenerative capacity, and their death leads to permanent hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. Their paucity and inaccessibility has limited the search for otoprotective and regenerative strategies. Growing hair cells in vitro would provide a route to overcome this experimental bottleneck. We report a combination of four transcription factors (Six1, Atoh1, Pou4f3, and Gfi1) that can convert mouse embryonic fibroblasts, adult tail-tip fibroblasts and postnatal supporting cells into induced hair cell-like cells (iHCs). iHCs exhibit hair cell-like morphology, transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles, electrophysiological properties, mechanosensory channel expression, and vulnerability to ototoxin in a high-content phenotypic screening system. Thus, direct reprogramming provides a platform to identify causes and treatments for hair cell loss, and may help identify future gene therapy approaches for restoring hearing.","Menendez, Louise; Trecek, Talon; Gopalakrishnan, Suhasni; Tao, Litao; Markowitz, Alexander L; Yu, Haoze V; Wang, Xizi; Llamas, Juan; Huang, Chichou; Lee, James; Kalluri, Radha; Ichida, Justin; Segil, Neil",,142,1

The strain was identified as a representative of the genus Halomonas in the Gammaproteobacteria. The bacterium was capable of PPN utilization as a nitrogen source only, while phenylacetonitrile (PAN) served both as carbon, energy and nitrogen source. This capacity was not described previously for any other haloalkaliphilic bacteria. Apart from the nitriles mentioned above, resting cells of ANL-αCH3 also hydrolyzed mandelonitrile, benzonitrile, acrylonitrile, and phenylglycinonitrile, presumably using nitrilase pathway. Neither nitrile hydratase nor amidase activity was detected. The isolate showed a capacity to grow with benzoate and salicylate as carbon and energy source and demonstrated the ability to completely mineralize PAN. These clearly indicated a potential to catabolize aromatic compounds. On the basis of unique phenotype and distinct phylogeny, strain ANL-αCH3 is proposed as a novel species of the genus Halomonas—Halomonas nitrilicus sp. nov.

The study determined anti-CAV antibodies within 28 days of re-vaccination and factors associated with the absence of antibodies and vaccination response. Methods: Ninety-seven healthy adult dogs (last vaccination ≥12 months) were re-vaccinated with a modified live CAV-2 vaccine. Anti-CAV antibodies were measured before vaccination (day 0), and after re-vaccination (day 7, 28) by virus neutralization. A ≥4-fold titer increase was defined as vaccination response. Fisher’s exact test and multivariate regression analysis were performed to determine factors associated with the absence of antibodies and vaccination response. Results: Totally, 87% of dogs (90/97; 95% CI: 85.61–96.70) had anti-CAV antibodies (≥10) before re-vaccination. Vaccination response was observed in 6% of dogs (6/97; 95% CI: 2.60–13.11). Time since last vaccination (>3–5 years, OR = 9.375, p = 0.020; >5 years, OR = 25.000, p = 0.006) was associated with a lack of antibodies. Dogs from urban areas were more likely to respond to vaccination (p = 0.037). Conclusion: Many dogs had anti-CAV pre-vaccination antibodies, even those with an incomplete vaccination series. Most dogs did not respond to re-vaccination. Based on this study, dogs should be re-vaccinated every 3 years or antibodies should be determined.","Bergmann, Michèle; Freisl, Monika; Zablotski, Yury; Speck, Stephanie; Truyen, Uwe; Hartmann, Katrin",Viruses,142,1

There is emerging evidence that an aberrant immune response in the initial stages of infection lead to severe disease. Many inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators are significantly higher in patients with severe dengue compared to those who develop mild infection, during febrile phase of illness. Monocytes, mast cells, and many other cells of the immune system, when infected with the DENV, especially in the presence of poorly neutralizing antibodies, leads to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of interferon signaling pathways. In addition, production of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 further leads to inhibition of cellular antiviral responses. This dysregulated and aberrant immune response leads to reduced clearance of the virus, and severe dengue by inducing a vascular leak and excessive inflammation due to high levels of inflammatory cytokines. Individuals with comorbid illnesses could be prone to more severe dengue due to low grade endotoxemia, gut microbial dysbiosis and an altered phenotype of innate immune cells. The immunosuppressive and inflammatory lipid mediators and altered phenotype of monocytes are likely to further act on T cells and B cells leading to an impaired adaptive immune response to the virus. Therefore, in order to identify therapeutic targets for treatment of dengue, it would be important to further characterize these mechanisms in order for early intervention. In this review, we discuss the differences in the innate immune responses in those who progress to develop severe dengue, compared to those with milder disease in order to understand the mechanisms that lead to severe dengue.","Malavige, Gathsaurie Neelika; Jeewandara, Chandima; Ogg, Graham S.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,142,33

In most patients, the EEG changes somewhat predictably in response to propofol and volatile agents, so a frontal EEG channel can guide avoidance of insufficient and excessive administration of general anesthesia. Persistent alpha-spindles (around 10 Hz) phase-amplitude coupled with slow delta waves (around 1 Hz) are commonly seen during an “appropriate hypnotic state of general anesthesia”. Such patterns can be appreciated from the EEG waveform or from the spectrogram (a colour-coded display of how the power in the various EEG frequencies changes with time). Nevertheless, there are exceptions to this. For example, administration of ketamine and nitrous oxide is generally not associated with the aforementioned alpha-spindle coupled with delta wave pattern. Also, some patients, including older adults and those with neurodegenerative disorders, are less predisposed to generate a strong electroencephalographic “alpha-spindle” pattern during general anesthesia. There might also be some rare instances when the frontal EEG shows a pattern suggestive of general anesthesia, while the patient has some awareness and is able to follow simple commands, albeit this is typically without obvious distress or memory formation. Thus, the frontal EEG alone, as currently analyzed, is an imperfect but clinically useful mirror, and more scientific insights will be needed before we can claim to have a reliable readout of brain “function” during general anesthesia.","Hight, Darren F.; Kaiser, Heiko K.; Sleigh, Jamie W.; Avidan, Michael S.",Can J Anaesth,142,1

Today it is a matter of course that a reliable diagnosis is made before treating a disease, but this must be viewed as inconsistent in medical history. The beginnings of radical prostatectomy for the treatment of prostate cancer, like the first surgical therapies for kidney and bladder tumors, can be located in the pioneering period of organ surgery in the German Empire (1871–1918). The establishment of this procedure in its current form with larger numbers of cases is in turn thanks to the Nestor of American urology, Hugh Hampton Young, who carried out the first perineal prostatovesiculectomy, which from today’s perspective can be described as complete. Although the indication has remained largely unchanged since then, this intervention has undergone extensive changes in recent decades. But how has the diagnosis of prostate cancer developed in this period? Of course, much more dynamic. While the procedure prostatovesiculectomy was already established, development of prostate cancer diagnosis began first slowly in the course of the 20th century, then more dynamically. The following article uses medical (historical) original sources to present not only the basics and further developments of the established and, at the same time, subject to constant intervention in urology, but also the essential developments in the environment of neighboring medical disciplines, for example, think of laboratory medicine, radiology, nuclear medicine or rehabilitation medicine, but especially pathology. Incidentally, it was only these developments that created the basis for the correct setting of indications and the identification of alternatives to radical prostatovesiculectomy.","Otto, Wolfgang; Wieland, Wolf F.",Urologe A,142,1

Secondary bacterial infections, including Staphylococcus aureus, result in increased morbidity and mortality during seasonal epidemics and pandemics. While coinfections can result in deleterious pathologic consequences, including alveolar-capillary barrier disruption, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We have characterized host- and pathogen-centric mechanisms contributing to influenza-bacterial coinfections in a primary cell coculture model of the alveolar-capillary barrier. Using 2009 pandemic influenza (pH1N1) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), we demonstrate that coinfection resulted in dysregulated barrier function. Preinfection with pH1N1 resulted in modulation of adhesion- and invasion-associated MRSA virulence factors during lag phase bacterial replication. Host response modulation in coinfected alveolar epithelial cells were primarily related to TLR- and inflammatory response-mediated cell signaling events. While less extensive in cocultured endothelial cells, coinfection resulted in changes to cellular stress response- and TLR-related signaling events. Analysis of cytokine expression suggested that cytokine secretion might play an important role in coinfection pathogenesis. Taken together, we demonstrate that coinfection pathogenesis is related to complex host- and pathogen-mediated events impacting both epithelial and endothelial cell regulation at the alveolar-capillary barrier.","Nickol, Michaela E.; Lyle, Sarah M.; Dennehy, Brendan; Kindrachuk, Jason",Cells,142,1

Inflammation is one of the non-genetic factors that has been shown to greatly affect the metabolism of drugs—primarily through inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) drug-metabolizing enzymes—and hence contribute to the mismatch between the genotype predicted drug response and the actual phenotype, a phenomenon called phenoconversion. This review focuses on inflammation-induced drug metabolism alterations. In particular, we discuss the evidence assembled through human in-vitro models on the effect of inflammatory mediators on clinically relevant CYP450 isoform levels and their metabolizing capacity. We also present an overview of the current understanding of the mechanistic pathways via which inflammation in hepatocytes may modulate hepatic functions that are critical for drug metabolism. Furthermore, since large inter-individual variability in response to inflammation is observed in human in-vitro models and clinical studies, we evaluate the potential role of pharmacogenetic variability in the inflammatory signaling cascade and how this can modulate the outcome of inflammation on drug metabolism and response.","de Jong, Laura M.; Jiskoot, Wim; Swen, Jesse J.; Manson, Martijn L.",Genes (Basel),142,1

However, patients’ readiness for this solution has not been investigated among patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to evaluate patients’ anticipated experiences regarding telemedicine, including voice conversational agents combined with provider-driven support delivered by phone. METHODS: A cross-sectional study enrolled patients with chronic CVD who were surveyed using a validated investigator-designed questionnaire combining 19 questions (eg, demographic data, medical history, preferences for using telehealth services). Prior to the survey, respondents were educated on the telemedicine services presented in the questionnaire while being assisted by a medical doctor. Responses were then collected and analyzed, and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of willingness to use voice technology. RESULTS: In total, 249 patients (mean age 65.3, SD 13.8 years; 158 [63.5%] men) completed the questionnaire, which showed good repeatability in the validation procedure. Of the 249 total participants, 209 (83.9%) reported high readiness to receive services allowing for remote contact with a cardiologist (176/249, 70.7%) and telemonitoring of vital signs (168/249, 67.5%).

METHODS: Using a reverse vaccinology approach, where genomic analysis informed the Shigella immunome via an antigen microarray, we aimed to identify novel immunogenic Shigella antigens. A core genome analysis of Shigella species, pathogenic and non-pathogenic Escherichia coli, led to the selection of 234 predicted immunogenic Shigella antigens. These antigens were expressed and probed with acute and convalescent serum from microbiologically confirmed Shigella infections. RESULTS: Several Shigella antigens displayed IgG and IgA seroconversion, with no difference in sero-reactivity across by sex or age. IgG sero-reactivity to key Shigella antigens was observed at birth, indicating transplacental antibody transfer. Six antigens (FepA, EmrK, FhuA, MdtA, NlpB, and CjrA) were identified in in vivo testing as capable of producing binding IgG and complement-mediated bactericidal antibody. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide six novel immunogenic Shigella proteins that could serve as candidate vaccine antigens, species-specific carrier proteins, or targeted adjuvants.

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the utility of histopathology, IHC, and clonality testing to differentiate between IBD and LSA and agreement of diagnostic results for endoscopic biopsy (EB) samples from the upper (USI) and lower small intestine (LSI). ANIMALS: Fifty‐seven cats with IBD or LSA. METHODS: All cases were categorized as definitive IBD (DefIBD), possible LSA (PossLSA), probable LSA (ProbLSA), or definitive LSA (DefLSA) based on histopathology alone. Results from IHC and clonality testing were integrated. RESULTS: Based on histopathology alone, 24/57 (42.1%), 15/57 (26.3%), and 18/57 (31.6%) cats were diagnosed with DefIBD, PossLSA or ProbLSA, and DefLSA, respectively. After integrating IHC and clonality testing, 11/24 cases (45.8%) and 15/15 cases (100%) previously categorized as DefIBD and PossLSA or ProbLSA, respectively, were reclassified as LSA. A final diagnosis of IBD and LSA was reported in 13/57 (22.8%) and 44/57 (77.2%) cats, respectively. Agreement between USI and LSI samples was moderate based on histopathology alone (κ = 0.66) and after integrating IHC and clonality testing (κ = 0.70). However, only 1/44 (2.3%) of the LSA cases was diagnosed based on LSI biopsy alone. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Integrating IHC and clonality testing increased the number of cases diagnosed with LSA, but the consequence for patient outcome is unclear. There was moderate agreement between USI and LSI samples. Samples from the LSI rarely changed the diagnosis.","Chow, Betty; Hill, Steve L.; Richter, Keith P.; Marsilio, Sina; Ackermann, Mark R.; Lidbury, Jonathan A.; Suchodolski, Jan S.; Cocker, Sarah; Steiner, Jörg M.",J Vet Intern Med,142,1

The viral envelope glycoprotein E2 and E(rns) are major targets for eliciting antibodies against CSFV in infected animals. In this report, the glycoprotein E2 and E(rns) were expressed using the baculovirus system and their protective immunity in rabbits were tested. Twenty CSFV seronegative rabbits were randomly divided into five groups. Each rabbit was intramuscularly immunized with CSFV-E2, CSFV-E(rns), or their combination (CSFV-E2 + E(rns)). Besides, a commercial CSFV vaccine (C-strain) and PBS were used as positive or negative controls, respectively. Four weeks after the second immunization, all the rabbits were challenged with 100 RID(50) of CSFV C-strain. High levels of CSFV E2-specific antibody, neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to CSFV were elicited in the rabbits inoculated with C-strain, CSFV-E2, and CSFV-E2 + E(rns). And the rabbits inoculated with the three vaccines received complete protection against CSFV C-strain. However, no neutralizing antibody was detected in the E(rns) vaccinated rabbits and the rabbits exhibited fever typical of CSFV, suggesting the E(rns) alone is not able to induce a protective immune response. Taken together, while the E(rns) could not confer protection against CSFV, E2 and E2 + E(rns) could not only elicit humoral and cell-mediated immune responses but also confer complete protection against CSFV C-strain in rabbits.","Wei, Qiang; Bai, Yilin; Song, Yapeng; Liu, Yunchao; Yu, Wei; Sun, Yaning; Wang, Li; Deng, Ruiguang; Xing, Guangxu; Zhang, Gaiping",Virol J,142,1

Orbital fibroblasts contribute to both orbital tissue inflammation and remodeling in GO, and as such are crucial cellular elements in active GO and inactive GO. However, so far it is largely unknown whether GO disease progression is associated with functional reprogramming of the orbital fibroblast effector function. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare both the proteome and global DNA methylation patterns between orbital fibroblasts isolated from active GO, inactive GO and healthy controls. METHODS: Orbital fibroblasts from inactive GO (n=5), active GO (n=4) and controls (n=5) were cultured and total protein and DNA was isolated. Labelled and fractionated proteins were analyzed with a liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD022257. Furthermore, bisulphite-treated DNA was analyzed for methylation pattern with the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450K beadchip. In addition, RNA was isolated from the orbital fibroblasts for real-time quantitative (RQ)-PCR. Network and pathway analyses were performed. RESULTS: Orbital fibroblasts from active GO displayed overexpression of proteins that are typically involved in inflammation, cellular proliferation, hyaluronan synthesis and adipogenesis, while various proteins associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) biology and fibrotic disease, were typically overexpressed in orbital fibroblasts from inactive GO. Moreover, orbital fibroblasts from active GO displayed hypermethylation of genes that linked to inflammation and hypomethylated genes that linked to adipogenesis and autoimmunity. Further analysis revealed networks that contained molecules to which both hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes were linked, including NF-κB, ERK1/2, Alp, RNA polymerase II, Akt and IFNα. In addition, NF-κB, Akt and IFNα were also identified in networks that were derived from the differentially expressed proteins. Generally, poor correlation between protein expression, DNA methylation and mRNA expression was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Both the proteomics and DNA methylation data support that orbital fibroblasts from active GO are involved in inflammation, adipogenesis, and glycosaminoglycan production, while orbital fibroblasts from inactive disease are more skewed towards an active role in extracellular matrix remodeling. This switch in orbital fibroblast effector function may have therapeutic implications and further studies into the underlying mechanism are thus warranted.","Virakul, Sita; Somparn, Poorichaya; Pisitkun, Trairak; van der Spek, Peter J.; Dalm, Virgil A.

NH(3), as a stimulus, exerts negative impact on broiler growth and production, but the molecular mechanisms are not clear yet. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation of Bupleurum falcatum L saikosaponins (SP) on the growth and ileum health status in broilers exposed to NH(3). Day-old Arbor Acers broilers (n = 480) were randomly allocated into 1 of 4 treatments. The main factors were dietary SP supplementation (0 or 80 mg/kg of diet) and NH(3) challenge (with or without 70 ± 5 ppm NH(3)). The data of growth, intestinal morphology, and mRNA expression related to ileal function were collected from broilers exposed to NH(3) for 7 d. Results showed that NH(3) remarkably suppressed growth performance and intestinal development as well as induced biological injuries in the ileum of broilers, resulting from oxidative stress, mucous barrier damage, and immune dysfunction as well as upregulated apoptosis. These negative effects of NH(3) were alleviated by the SP supplement. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of SP may be helpful in alleviating the detrimental effects of NH(3) on the ileum development in broilers.","Shu, Gang; Xu, Dan; Ran, Chonglin; Yin, Lizi; Lin, Juchun; Fu, Hualin; Zhang, Wei; Bai, Shiping; Peng, Xi; Zhao, Xiaoling; Amevor, Felix Kwame",Poult Sci,142,7

Biocuration is essential to extract knowledge from research data and make it available in a structured and standardized way to the scientific community. However, processing biological data—mainly from literature—requires a huge effort that is difficult to attribute and quantify. APICURON collects biocuration events from third-party resources and aggregates this information, spotlighting biocurator contributions. APICURON promotes biocurator engagement implementing gamification concepts like badges, medals and leaderboards and at the same time provides a monitoring service for registered resources and for biocurators themselves. APICURON adopts a data model that is flexible enough to represent and track the majority of biocuration activities. Biocurators are identified through their Open Researcher and Contributor ID. The definition of curation events, scoring systems and rules for assigning badges and medals are resource-specific and easily customizable. Registered resources can transfer curation activities on the fly through a secure and robust Application Programming Interface (API). Here, we show how simple and effective it is to connect a resource to APICURON, describing the DisProt database of intrinsically disordered proteins as a use case. We believe APICURON will provide biological knowledgebases with a service to recognize and credit the effort of their biocurators, monitor their activity and promote curator engagement.

Reliable and affordable neurobiological and psychological biomarkers that distinguish problematic internet use (PIU) from functional online activities are of utmost importance. Previous studies have shown a relationship between spontaneous eye blinking rate (sEBR) and changes in dopamine regulation in neurological and psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders. In this study, we utilized sEBR to examine the potential link between individual differences in dopaminergic neurotransmission and PIU. In sum, 62 subjects participated in this study (median age 25, IQR 6 years, 34 females). The Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire (PIUQ-9), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Clark–Beck Obsessive–Compulsive Inventory (CBOCI) and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) were used for psychological assessment. The sEBRs were assessed with an electrooculogram recorded from above and below the left eye and from the right and left outer canthi. The group with PIU (PIUQ-9 > 20) expressed higher levels of impulsivity and compulsive behavior symptoms than the control group. In the group with PIU, impulsivity levels were inversely related to sEBR, and a trend of negative association of sEBR with compulsive behavior was observed. Future research should enroll subjects with high levels of PIU and strongly expressed psychopathology levels to further address the utility of sEBR as a potential biomarker.","Simkute, Dovile; Nagula, Igor; Tarailis, Povilas; Burkauskas, Julius; Griskova-Bulanova, Inga",J Pers Med,142,1

However, high STED light power (10(1∼3) MW/cm(2)) is often required to achieve significant resolution improvement, which inevitably introduces phototoxicity and severe photobleaching, damaging the imaging quality, especially for long-term cases. Recently, the employment of nanoprobes (quantum dots, upconversion nanoparticles, carbon dots, polymer dots, AIE dots, etc.) in STED imaging has brought opportunities to overcoming such long-existing issues. These nanomaterials designed for STED imaging show not only lower STED power requirements but also more efficient photoluminescence (PL) and enhanced photostability than organic molecular probes. Herein, we review the recent progress in the development of nanoprobes for STED imaging, to highlight their potential in improving the long-term imaging quality of STED microscopy and broadening its application scope. We also discuss the pros and cons for specific classes of nanoprobes for STED bioimaging in detail to provide practical references for biological researchers seeking suitable imaging kits, promoting the development of relative research field.","Liu, Yanfeng; Peng, Zheng; Peng, Xiao; Yan, Wei; Yang, Zhigang; Qu, Junle",Front Chem,142,1

Secondarily, this study tested the change in physical activity (PA) and sedentary time with intervention exposure. METHODS: Prior to randomization to the intervention (n = 45) or behavior “as usual” wait-listed control (n = 40) groups, participants completed baseline surveys and an accelerometer protocol. The intervention focused on increasing PA and decreasing sedentary time through social cognitive theory techniques. Follow-up acceptability/usability surveys (intervention group only) and accelerometers were sent after the intervention period. Information on intervention completion, adverse events, and user statistics were collected to determine feasibility. Median login time and mean acceptability/usability scores were calculated. RESULTS: Participants (mean age = 60 ± 7 years) included female (n = 80, 94%) and male survivors of breast (82%), colon (6%), endometrial (6%), bladder (4%), and kidney (2%) cancer. Seventy-eight (91.7%) participants returned partially or fully complete post-intervention data. There were no reported injuries or safety concerns. Intervention participants logged into the website for a total of 95 min (Q1, Q3 = 11, 204). System usability scores (72 ± 3) indicated above average usability of the website. Changes in time spent active and sedentary were not statistically significantly different between groups (p = 0.45), but within-group changes suggested intervention group participants spent more time active and less time sedentary after the intervention. CONCLUSION: Results of this pilot study suggest its feasibility and acceptability for survivors of several inactivity-related cancers. Additional research to determine long-term efficacy is warranted. This low-cost online-only intervention has the potential to have a very broad reach.

Due to the high density of these codes, their non-modular nature and the complex intracellular processes they encode, the ability of current approaches to decipher them is very limited. We describe the first computational-experimental pipeline for studying the effects of viral silent and non-silent information on its fitness. The pipeline was implemented to study the Porcine Circovirus type 2 (PCV2), the shortest known eukaryotic virus, and includes the following steps: (1) Based on the analyses of 2100 variants of PCV, suspected silent codes were inferred. (2) Five hundred variants of the PCV2 were designed to include various ‘smart’ silent mutations. (3) Using state of the art synthetic biology approaches, the genomes of these five hundred variants were generated. (4) Competition experiments between the variants were performed in Porcine kidney-15 (PK15) cell-lines. (5) The variant titers were analyzed based on novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments. (6) The features related to the titer of the variants were inferred and their analyses enabled detection of various novel silent functional sequence and structural motifs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 50 of the silent variants exhibit higher fitness than the wildtype in the analyzed conditions.","Baron, Lia; Atar, Shimshi; Zur, Hadas; Roopin, Modi; Goz, Eli; Tuller, Tamir",Sci Rep,142,1

The primary methods of PVI are radiofrequency catheter ablation (RF) and cryoballoon catheter ablation (CRYO), but these methods have not been directly compared with respect to PVI durability and the effect thereof on AF burden (% of time in AF). METHODS: Accordingly, we performed a randomized trial including 98 patients (68% male, 61 [55–67] years) with paroxysmal AF assigned 1:1 to PVI by contact-force sensing, irrigated radiofrequency catheter, or second-generation cryoballoon catheter. Implantable cardiac monitors were inserted ≥1 month before PVI for assessment of AF burden and recurrence, and all patients, irrespective of AF recurrence, underwent a second procedure 4 to 6 months after PVI to determine PVI durability. RESULTS: In the second procedure, 152 out of 199 (76%) pulmonary veins (PVs) were found durably isolated after RF and 161 out of 200 (81%) after CRYO (P=0.32), corresponding to durable isolation of all veins in 47% of patients in both groups (P=1.0). Median AF burden before PVI was 5.4% (interquartile range, 0.5%–13.0%) versus 4.0% (0.6%–18.1%), RF versus CRYO (P=0.71), and reduced to 0.0% (0.0%–0.1%) and 0.0% (0.0%–0.5%), respectively (P=0.58)—a reduction of 99.9% (92.9%–100.0%) and 99.3% (85.9%–100.0%; P=0.36). AF burden after PVI significantly correlated to the number of durably isolated PVs (P<0.01), but 9 out of 45 (20%) patients with durable isolation of all veins had recurrence of AF within 4 to 6 months after PVI (excluding a 3-month blanking period). CONCLUSIONS: PVI by RF and CRYO produce similar moderate to high PVI durability. Both treatments lead to marked reductions in AF burden, which is related to the number of durably isolated PVs. However, for one-fifth of paroxysmal AF patients, complete and durable PVI was not sufficient to prevent even short-term AF recurrence.

We investigated whether antifungal prophylaxis reduces the incidence of IAPA. METHODS: We compared 7 days of intravenous posaconazole (POS) prophylaxis with no prophylaxis (standard-of-care only, SOC) in a randomised, open-label, proof-of-concept trial in patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure due to influenza (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03378479). Adult patients with PCR-confirmed influenza were block randomised (1:1) within 10 days of symptoms onset and 48 h of ICU admission. The primary endpoint was the incidence of IAPA during ICU stay in patients who did not have IAPA within 48 h of ICU admission (modified intention-to-treat (MITT) population). RESULTS: Eighty-eight critically ill influenza patients were randomly allocated to POS or SOC. IAPA occurred in 21 cases (24%), the majority of which (71%, 15/21) were diagnosed within 48 h of ICU admission, excluding them from the MITT population. The incidence of IAPA was not significantly reduced in the POS arm (5.4%, 2/37) compared with SOC (11.1%, 4/36; between-group difference 5.7%; 95% CI − 10.8 to 21.7; p = 0.32). ICU mortality of early IAPA was high (53%), despite rapid antifungal treatment. CONCLUSION: The higher than expected incidence of early IAPA precludes any definite conclusion on POS prophylaxis. High mortality of early IAPA, despite timely antifungal therapy, indicates that alternative management strategies are required. After 48 h, still 11% of patients developed IAPA. As these could benefit from prophylaxis, differentiated strategies are likely needed to manage IAPA in the ICU.

Pooled outcomes indicated a higher NLR in GDM pregnancies than in normoglycemic controls (SMD = 0.584; 95% CI, 0.339–0.830; P < .001), although extensive heterogeneity between studies was noted. Subgroup analysis revealed that the higher pooled estimate in GDM was not affected by diagnostic criteria, ethnicity, or BMI, although matching for BMI reduced heterogeneity between studies. This meta-analysis supports the higher NLR in GDM described by some individual studies.","Pace, Nikolai Paul; Vassallo, Josanne",J Endocr Soc,142,1

We present a method for the delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes by nucleofection directly into CD14(+) human monocytes purified from peripheral blood, leading to high rates of precise gene knockout. These cells can be efficiently differentiated into monocyte-derived macrophages or dendritic cells. This process yields genetically edited cells that retain transcript and protein markers of myeloid differentiation and phagocytic function. Genetic ablation of the restriction factor SAMHD1 increased HIV-1 infection >50-fold, demonstrating the power of this system for genotype-phenotype interrogation. This fast, flexible, and scalable platform can be used for genetic studies of human myeloid cells in immune signaling, inflammation, cancer immunology, host-pathogen interactions, and beyond, and could facilitate the development of myeloid cellular therapies.","Hiatt, Joseph; Cavero, Devin A.; McGregor, Michael J.; Zheng, Weihao; Budzik, Jonathan M.; Roth, Theodore L.; Haas, Kelsey M.; Wu, David; Rathore, Ujjwal; Meyer-Franke, Anke; Bouzidi, Mohamed S.; Shifrut, Eric; Lee, Youjin; Kumar, Vigneshwari Easwar; Dang, Eric V.; Gordon, David E.; Wojcechowskyj, Jason A.; Hultquist, Judd F.; Fontaine, Krystal A.; Pillai, Satish K.; Cox, Jeffery S.; Ernst, Joel D.; Krogan, Nevan J.; Marson, Alexander",Cell Rep,142,1

This study aimed to investigate the effects of nature video viewing on isometric exercise and find a useful practice for green exercise in urban living. In the current study, 18 male subjects were recruited in a randomized crossover trial and underwent a sequence of wall squat exercises. The whole experiment contained three periods of baseline (before exercise), exercise, and recovery (after exercise), and each period lasted for 2 min. A video of forest walking was played in the exercise and recovery periods as treatment, while a black screen was set as control. The Rate of Perceived Exertion Scale (RPE) and Feeling Scale (FS) were employed to measure perceived exertion and affective responses in the exercise period; heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) including the standard deviation of normal-to-normal RR intervals (SDNN), the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), and the standard deviations of the Poincaré plot (SD1), were recorded in the three periods. Heart rate recovery (HRR) in the recovery period was further calculated based on 30 s and 60 s time frames. Results demonstrated that during the exercise period nature video viewing was associated with better affective responses (median of 1.00 and an interquartile (IQR) of 2.00, p = 0.017), lower perceived exertion (median = 6.00, IQR = 2.00, p = 0.021), and lower HR (median = 89.60, IQR = 20.94, p = 0.01), but the differences in HRV indices between the experimental settings were not statistically significant. In the recovery period, significantly higher values of RMSSD (median = 34.88, IQR = 24.52, p = 0.004), SD1 (median = 24.75, IQR = 17.41, p = 0.003), and HR (median = 84.18, IQR = 16.58, p = 0.001) were observed in the treatment setting, whereas no statistically significant difference was found for HRR. In general, our findings support that nature video viewing may help reduce perceived exertion, increase exercise pleasure, buffer heart rate, and improve cardiac autonomic recovery for wall squat exercising, which implies the potential of nature-based stimuli in green exercise. However, due to the limited research sample, further study may need to include female participants and focus on various populations to confirm the effectiveness of using virtual and environments depicting nature at home or in public exercise places to promote positive exercise experience.","Li, Hansen; Zhang, Xing; Bi, Shilin; Liu, Haowei; Cao, Yang; Zhang, Guodong",Int J Environ Res Public Health,142,1

Its etiology is diverse; however genetic factors are significant. The most common mutations in HNSCC were found in the genes: PIK3CA (10–12%), BRCA1 (6%), and BRCA2 (7–9%). In some cases, these biomarkers correlate with recurrences or survival showing a potential of prognostic and predictive value. A total of 113 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor samples were collected from patients with HNSCC (oral cavity: 35 (31.0%); oropharynx: 30 (26.0%); larynx: 48 (43.0%)). We examined PIK3CA H1047R mutation by Real Time PCR (RT-qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were analyzed by RT-qPCR while p16 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Finally, we identified HPV infection by RT-qPCR. The relationships between genomic alterations and clinical parameters were assessed using the Yates’ corrected Chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test for nominal variables. Kaplan Meier plots were applied for survival analysis. Our results revealed 9 PIK3CA H1047R mutations detected by ddPCR: 8 of them were negative in RT-qPCR. Due to the use of different methods to test the presence of the PIK3CA gene mutation, different treatment decisions might be made. That is why it is so important to use the most sensitive methods available. We confirmed the usefulness of ddPCR in the PIK3CA mutation assessment in FFPE samples.","Borkowska, Edyta M.; Barańska, Magda; Kowalczyk, Magdalena; Pietruszewska, Wioletta",Biomolecules,142,1

Many successful patient-level interventions to prevent chronic disease progression and complications have used automated telephone self-management support, which relies on patient activation and communication to achieve improved health outcomes. It is not clear whether these interventions are similarly applicable to patients with LEP compared to patients with English proficiency. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were as follows: (1) To examine the impact of LEP on patient engagement (primary outcome) with a 12-month language-concordant self-management program that included automated telephone self-management support, designed for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). (2) To assess the impact of LEP on change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and albuminuria (secondary outcomes) resulting from the self-management program. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of the Kidney Awareness Registry and Education (KARE) pilot trial (NCT01530958) which was funded by the National Institutes of Health in August 2011, approved by the University of California Institutional Review Board in October 2011 (No. 11-07399), and executed between 2013 and 2015. Multivariable logistic and linear models were used to examine various facets of patient engagement with the CKD self-management support program by LEP status. Patient engagement was defined by patient’s use of educational materials, completion of a health coaching action plan, and degree of participation with automated telephone self-management support. Changes in SBP and albuminuria at 12 months by LEP status were determined using multivariable linear mixed models. RESULTS: Of 137 study participants, 53 (38.7%) reported LEP, of which 45 (85%) were Spanish speaking and 8 (15%) Cantonese speaking. While patients with LEP and English proficiency similarly used the program’s educational materials (85% [17/20] vs 88% [30/34], P=.69) and completed an action plan (81% [22/27] vs 74% [35/47], P=.49), those with LEP engaged more with the automated telephone self-management support component. Average call completion was 66% among patients with LEP compared with 57% among those with English proficiency; patients with LEP requested more health coach telephone calls (P=.08) and had a significantly longer average automated call duration (3.3 [SD 1.4] min vs 2.2 [1.1 min], P<.001), indicating higher patient engagement. Patients with LEP randomized to self-management support had a larger, though nonstatistically significant (P=.74), change in SBP (–4.5 mmHg; 95% CI –9.4 to 0.3) and albuminuria (–72.4 mg/dL; 95% CI –208.9 to 64.1) compared with patients with English proficiency randomized to self-management support (–2.1 mmHg; 95% CI –8.6 to 4.3 and –11.1 mg/dL; 95% CI –166.9 to 144.7). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LEP with CKD were equally or more engaged with a language-concordant, culturally appropriate telehealth intervention compared with their English-speaking counterparts. Augmented telehealth may be useful in mitigating communication barriers among patients with LEP.

IAV can infect a broad range of avian and mammalian species, depending on subtype, and avian IAV can be moved over relatively long distances by migratory birds. Although spillover infections from wildlife or domestic animals to humans are an important part of the transmission cycle that can drive outbreaks, the relevance of companion animals, specifically dogs and cats, is not fully understood. A novel pandemic H1N1 reassortant (H1N1pdm09) emerged from swine in 2009, infecting humans, and wild and domestic animals worldwide. During a 2016 human influenza outbreak in Kyiv, subtype H1N1pdm09 predominated and was associated with severe disease and deaths; however, H3N2 and influenza B viruses were also detected. No case of avian influenza in humans was detected. To investigate potential involvement of companion animals, animals in a veterinary hospital (116 cats and 88 dogs) were randomly selected, and sera were tested using a commercially available IAV nucleoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twelve of 203 serum samples were positive for influenza antibodies (5.7% of dogs and 6.08% cats). These are the first data to demonstrate influenza A infection of pets in Ukraine, highlighting the potential risk of infection of companion animals from close contact with humans.","Kovalenko, Ganna; Galat, Maryna; Ishchenko, Lyudmila; Halka, Ihor",Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,142,8

Upon binding to target cells, the antibody’s constant (Fc) domain recruits complement component C1 to initiate a proteolytic cascade that generates lytic pores and stimulates phagocytosis. The C1 complex (C1qr(2)s(2)) consists of the large recognition protein C1q and a heterotetramer of proteases C1r and C1s (C1r(2)s(2)). While interactions between C1 and IgG-Fc are believed to be mediated by the globular heads of C1q, we here find that C1r(2)s(2) proteases affect the capacity of C1q to form an avid complex with surface-bound IgG molecules (on various 2,4-dinitrophenol [DNP]-coated surfaces and pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus). The extent to which C1r(2)s(2) contributes to C1q–IgG stability strongly differs between human IgG subclasses. Using antibody engineering of monoclonal IgG, we reveal that hexamer-enhancing mutations improve C1q–IgG stability, both in the absence and presence of C1r(2)s(2). In addition, hexamer-enhanced IgGs targeting S. aureus mediate improved complement-dependent phagocytosis by human neutrophils. Altogether, these molecular insights into complement binding to surface-bound IgGs could be important for optimal design of antibody therapies.","Zwarthoff, Seline A.; Widmer, Kevin; Kuipers, Annemarie; Strasser, Jürgen; Ruyken, Maartje; Aerts, Piet C.; de Haas, Carla J.

METHODS: We performed an electronic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and Web of Science from inception until June 16, 2021 with no language restrictions. In addition, a research-in-progress database and grey literature were searched. RESULTS: We identified 22 RCTs (2225 patients) comparing higher PEEP (1007 patients) with lower PEEP (991 patients). No statistically significant association between higher PEEP and hospital mortality was observed (risk ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.89–1.16; I(2) = 0%, p = 0.62; low certainty of evidence). Among secondary outcomes, higher PEEP was associated with better oxygenation, higher respiratory system compliance, and lower risk of hypoxemia and ARDS occurrence. Furthermore, barotrauma, hypotension, duration of ventilation, lengths of stay, and ICU mortality were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In our meta-analysis of RCTs, higher PEEP, compared with lower PEEP, was not associated with mortality in patients without ARDS receiving invasive mechanical ventilation.

Innate immunity is critical for cell-autonomous clearance of intracellular pathogens like Burkholderia by regulating programmed cell death. Inflammasome-dependent inflammatory cytokine release and cell death contribute to host protection against Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia thailandensis; however, the contribution of apoptosis and necroptosis to protection is not known. Here, we found that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) lacking key components of pyroptosis died via apoptosis during infection. BMDMs lacking molecules required for pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis (PANoptosis), however, were significantly resistant to B. thailandensis-induced cell death until later stages of infection. Consequently, PANoptosis-deficient BMDMs failed to limit B. thailandensis-induced cell-cell fusion, which permits increased intercellular spread and replication compared to wild-type or pyroptosis-deficient BMDMs. Respiratory B. thailandensis infection resulted in higher mortality in PANoptosis-deficient mice than in pyroptosis-deficient mice, indicating that, in the absence of pyroptosis, apoptosis is essential for efficient control of infection in vivo. Together, these findings suggest both pyroptosis and apoptosis are necessary for host-mediated control of Burkholderia infection.","Place, David E.; Christgen, Shelbi; Tuladhar, Shraddha; Vogel, Peter; Malireddi, R.

However, lung function decline, hospitalizations, and mortality may be reduced with the use of the antifibrotic medications, nintedanib and pirfenidone. Historical outcomes for hospitalized patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis are grim; however there is a paucity of data since the approval of nintedanib and pirfenidone for treatment. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of nintedanib and pirfenidone on mortality following respiratory-related hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Using a large U.S. insurance database, we created a one-to-one propensity score matched cohort of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treated and untreated with an antifibrotic who underwent respiratory-related hospitalization between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2018. Mortality was evaluated at 30 days and end of follow-up (up to 2 years). Subgroup analyses were performed for all patients receiving treatment in an ICU and those receiving invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation during the index hospitalization. RESULTS: Antifibrotics were not observed to effect utilization of mechanical ventilation or ICU treatment during the index admission or effect mortality at 30-days. If patients survived hospitalization, mortality was reduced in the treated cohort compared to the untreated cohort when followed up to two years (20.1% vs 47.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with antifibrotic medications does not appear to directly improve 30-day mortality during or after respiratory-related hospitalizations.

In the current study, a novel Kunitz-like trypsin inhibitor, Kunitzin-AH, was isolated from the skin secretion of Amolops hainanensis. The novel peptide displayed a modest trypsin inhibitory activity with the inhibitor constant (K(i)) value of 1.18 ± 0.08 µM without inducing damage to healthy horse erythrocytes. Then, a series of shortened variants of Kunitzin-AH were designed by truncating a peptide loop and site mutation inside the loop to illustrate the structure–activity relationship of the trypsin inhibition function. Among the variants, a significant decrease was observed for the Cys-Cys loop domain, while the extension of an Arg at N-terminus (RCKAAFC) retained the inhibitory activity, indicating that the -RCK-motif is essential in forming the reactive domain for exerting the inhibitory activity. Furthermore, substitutions of Ala by hydrophobic or hydrophilic residues decreased the activity, indicating suitable steric hindrance provides convenience for the combination of trypsin. Additionally, the conformational simulation of the analogues processed with Chimera and Gromacs and further combination simulations between the peptides and trypsin conducted with HDOCK offered a potential opportunity for the natural trypsin inhibitory drug design.

METHODS: We defined legal accountability as use of the judicial system following state failure to respect, protect or fulfil SRHR as enshrined in national law, as well as individuals’ or the state’s use of criminal law mechanisms to prevent unwanted behaviour and to provide remedy. We undertook a keyword search in PubMed, Scopus and LexisNexis and then consulted a group of experts to provide guidance regarding further peer-reviewed and grey literature, yielding a total of 191 articles. RESULTS: The majority of the empirical, peer-reviewed articles identified were regarding abortion law and abortion care availability, followed by violence against women. Most of these articles explore the gaps between law and practice. We identified seven key factors that shape the efficacy of legal accountability efforts, including the ways a law or court decision is formulated, access to courts, the (dis)advantages of criminal law in the given context, cultural norms, politics, state capacity and resources and the potential for further litigation. Many articles explained that use of the judiciary may be necessary to effect change and that the act of claiming rights can empower, but that legal avenues for change can be imperfect tools for justice.

RESULTS: Among 43,687 MSM who initiated the questionnaire, 27,318 (62.5%) reported their HIV status; 7001 (25.6%) of whom were YMSM. Most YMSM (83.4%) reported an HIV test in the past year, and 15.7% reported an HIV positive status in Peru, 8.4% in Mexico and 7.7% in Brazil. In adjusted models, low-income was associated with higher odds of self-reported HIV positive status in Brazil (aOR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.01–1.75) and Peru (aOR = 1.56, 95%CI: 1.02–2.40), but not in Mexico. Lower education was associated with higher odds of self-reported HIV positive status only in Brazil (aOR = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.05–1.75). CONCLUSIONS: In this large, cross-country study, self-reported HIV positive status among YMSM was high. Lower socioeconomic status was associated with higher odds of self-reported HIV positive status in Brazil and Peru. There is an urgent need for HIV prevention interventions targeting YMSM, and efforts to address low-income YMSM are especially needed in Peru and Brazil.

The majority of deaths (99%) occur in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). Vaccines against RSV infection are underway. To obtain access to RSV interventions, LMICs depend on support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. To identify future vaccine target populations, information on children with severe RSV infection is required. However, there is a lack of individual patient-level clinical data on instances of life-threatening RSV infection in LMICs. The RSV GOLD III—ICU Network study aims to describe clinical, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of children with life-threatening RSV infection in Gavi-eligible countries. METHODS: The RSV GOLD-III—ICU Network study is an international, prospective, observational multicenter study and will be conducted in 10 Gavi-eligible countries at pediatric intensive care units and high-dependency units (PICUs/HDUs) during local viral respiratory seasons for 2 years. Children younger than 2 years of age with respiratory symptoms fulfilling the World Health Organization (WHO) “extended severe acute respiratory infection (SARI)” case definition will be tested for RSV using a molecular point-of-care (POC) diagnostic device. Patient characteristics will be collected through a questionnaire. Mortality rates of children admitted to the PICU and/or HDU will be calculated. DISCUSSION: This multicenter descriptive study will provide a better understanding of the characteristics and mortality rates of children younger than 2 years with RSV infection admitted to the PICU/HDU in LMICs. These results will contribute to knowledge on global disease burden and awareness of RSV and will directly guide decision makers in their efforts to implement future RSV prevention strategies.

A Secondary Analysis from the IOPS-MS Study,13.879442,7.5771217,2021-08-10,"Over the past decade, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown very competitive performance in medical image analysis tasks, such as disease classification, tumor segmentation, and lesion detection. CNN has great advantages in extracting local features of images. However, due to the locality of convolution operation, it cannot deal with long-range relationships well. Recently, transformers have been applied to computer vision and achieved remarkable success in large-scale datasets. Compared with natural images, multi-modal medical images have explicit and important long-range dependencies, and effective multi-modal fusion strategies can greatly improve the performance of deep models. This prompts us to study transformer-based structures and apply them to multi-modal medical images. Existing transformer-based network architectures require large-scale datasets to achieve better performance. However, medical imaging datasets are relatively small, which makes it difficult to apply pure transformers to medical image analysis. Therefore, we propose TransMed for multi-modal medical image classification. TransMed combines the advantages of CNN and transformer to efficiently extract low-level features of images and establish long-range dependencies between modalities. We evaluated our model on two datasets, parotid gland tumors classification and knee injury classification. Combining our contributions, we achieve an improvement of 10.1% and 1.9% in average accuracy, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art CNN-based models. The results of the proposed method are promising and have tremendous potential to be applied to a large number of medical image analysis tasks. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to apply transformers to multi-modal medical image classification.","Dai, Yin; Gao, Yifan; Liu, Fayu",Diagnostics (Basel),142,1

Resting heart rate variability (HRV) was used as indicator of cardiac autonomic control. Secondary factors were related to factors that contribute to cardiovascular health. Studies examining the effects of endurance, resistance, multimodal, or coordinative training interventions in healthy participants aged between 45 and 60 years old on average were considered. The methodological quality of the studies was examined using two assessment scales (TESTEX and STARD(HRV)). PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020206606. The literature review retrieved eight studies fulfilling all inclusion criteria. Cardiac autonomic control and cardiovascular health improved after endurance and multimodal interventions. Resistance training had no significant impact on HRV or any secondary health factor. Coordinative exercise interventions showed inconclusive results regarding HRV but showed significant improvements in secondary health factors. The quality assessment tools revealed some methodological and reporting deficits. Despite the small number of studies, we suggest endurance and multimodal interventions including aerobic exercises for the enhancement of cardiac autonomic control and the reduction of cardiovascular risk in middle-aged adults.

This review aims to summarize the current knowledge about the association of oral microbiota with OSCC and to describe possible etiopathogenetic mechanisms involved in processes of OSCC development and progression. Association studies included in this review were designed as case–control/case studies, analyzing the bacteriome, mycobiome, and virome from saliva, oral rinses, oral mucosal swabs, or oral mucosal tissue samples (deep and superficial) and comparing the results in healthy individuals to those with OSCC and/or with premalignant lesions. Changes in relative abundances of specific bacteria (e.g., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus sp.) and fungi (especially Candida sp.) were associated with OSCC. Viruses can also play a role; while the results of studies investigating the role of human papillomavirus in OSCC development are controversial, Epstein–Barr virus was positively correlated with OSCC. The oral microbiota has been linked to tumorigenesis through a variety of mechanisms, including the stimulation of cell proliferation, tumor invasiveness, angiogenesis, inhibition of cell apoptosis, induction of chronic inflammation, or production of oncometabolites. We also advocate for the necessity of performing a complex analysis of the microbiome in further studies and of standardizing the sampling procedures by establishing guidelines to support future meta-analyses.","Vyhnalova, Tereza; Danek, Zdenek; Gachova, Daniela; Linhartova, Petra Borilova",Microorganisms,142,1

It is doubtful whether the Starling bioreactance device, which averages CI over 24 s and refreshes the displayed value every 4 s (Starling-24.4), can detect the EEXPO-induced changes in CI (ΔCI). Our primary goal was to test whether this Starling device version detects preload responsiveness through EEXPO. We also tested whether shortening the averaging and refresh times to 8 s and one second, respectively, (Starling-8.1) improves the accuracy of the device in detecting preload responsiveness using EEXPO. METHODS: In 42 mechanically ventilated patients, during a 15-s EEXPO, we measured ∆CI through calibrated pulse contour analysis (CI(pulse), PiCCO2 device) and using the Starling device. For the latter, we considered both CI(Starling-24.4) from the commercial version and CI(Starling-8.1) derived from the raw data. For relative ∆CI(Starling-24.4) and ∆CI(Starling-8.1) during EEXPO, we calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) to detect preload responsiveness, defined as an increase in CI(pulse) ≥ 10% during passive leg raising (PLR). For both methods, the correlation coefficient vs. ∆CI(pulse) was calculated. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were preload responders and sixteen non preload-responders. The AUROC for ∆CI(Starling-24.4) was significantly lower compared to ∆CI(Starling-8.1) (0.680 ± 0.086 vs. 0.899 ± 0.049, respectively; p = 0.027). A significant correlation was observed between ∆CI(Starling-8.1) and ∆CI(pulse) (r = 0.42; p = 0.009), but not between ∆CI(Starling-24.4) and ∆CI(pulse). During PLR, both ∆CI(Starling-24.4) and ∆CI(Starling-8.1) reliably detected preload responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Shortening the averaging and refresh times of the bioreactance signal to 8 s and one second, respectively, increases the reliability of the Starling device in detection of EEXPO-induced ∆CI.

However, probe-based multiplexing requires multiple fluorescent channels, while intercalating dye-based multiplexing needs primers to be designed for amplicons having different melting temperatures. Here, we report a single fluorescent channel-based qPCR duplexing method on a model containing the sequence of chromosomes 21 (Chr21) and 18 (Chr18). We combined nonspecific intercalating dye EvaGreen with a 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) probe specific to either Chr21 or Chr18. The copy number (cn) of the target linked to the FAM probe could be determined in the entire tested range from the denaturation curve, while the cn of the other one was determined from the difference between the denaturation and elongation curves. We recorded the amplitude of fluorescence at the end of denaturation and elongation steps, thus getting statistical data set to determine the limit of the proposed method in detail in terms of detectable concentration ratios of both targets. The proposed method eliminated the fluorescence overspilling that happened in probe-based qPCR multiplexing and determined the specificity of the PCR product via melting curve analysis. Additionally, we performed and verified our method using a commercial thermal cycler instead of a self-developed system, making it more generally applicable for researchers. This quantitative single-channel duplexing method is an economical substitute for a conventional rather expensive probe-based qPCR requiring different color probes and hardware capable of processing these fluorescent signals.","Zhang, Haoqing; Yan, Zhiqiang; Wang, Xinlu; Gaňová, Martina; Chang, Honglong; Laššáková, Soňa; Korabecna, Marie; Neuzil, Pavel",ACS Omega,142,22

Numerical simulations have shown that public health awareness of the susceptible individuals on snakebite preventive measures could reduce the number of envenoming and prevent deaths and disabilities in the population. The simulations further revealed that if at least fifty percent of snakebite envenoming patients receive early treatment with antivenom a substantial number of deaths will be averted. Furthermore, it is shown using optimal control that combining public health awareness and antivenom treatment averts the highest number of snakebite induced deaths and disability adjusted life years in the study area. To choose the best strategy amidst limited resources in the study area, cost effectiveness analysis in terms of incremental cost effectiveness ratio is performed. It has been established that the control efforts of combining public health awareness of the susceptible individuals and antivenom treatment for victims of snakebite envenoming is the most cost effective strategy.

The synergy between agonist binding and ‘co-activator’ recruitment is highly conformationally driven. The characterization of conformational dynamics is essential for mechanistic and therapeutic understanding. To shed light on the conformational ensembles, dynamics, and structural determinants that govern the activation process of FXR, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation is employed. Atomic insights into the ligand binding domain (LBD) of FXR revealed significant differences in inter/intra molecular bonding patterns, leading to structural anomalies in different systems of FXR. The sole presence of an agonist or ‘co-activator’ fails to achieve the essential bioactive conformation of FXR. However, the presence of both establishes the bioactive conformation of FXR as they modulate the internal wiring of key residues that coordinate allosteric structural transitions and their activity. We provide a precise description of critical residue positioning during conformational changes that elucidate the synergy between its binding partners to achieve an FXR activation state. Our study offers insights into the associated modulation occurring in FXR at bound and unbound forms. Thereafter, we also identified hot-spots that are critical to arrest the activation mechanism of FXR that would be helpful for the rational design of its agonists.","Kumari, Anita; Mittal, Lovika; Srivastava, Mitul; Pathak, Dharam Pal; Asthana, Shailendra",Front Mol Biosci,142,1

Particular attention must be paid to alcohol consumption among young people. It has been shown that 25% of young people’s deaths are attributable to alcohol, and around 35 million people aged over 11 had consumed at least one alcoholic beverage in 2015. Study Design: Young people aged 18–24 were the most vulnerable to binge drinking in Italy, and 50.6% of teenagers drunk alcohol. Only a few studies in the literature have investigated those habits in university students. This study aims to examine alcohol use habits in a population of university students in Italy. Methods: Between 2018 and 2019, an anonymous online questionnaire was randomly sent to university students from 17 different universities in a network of research centres to study alcohol use disorders. The survey included socio-demographic information, questions about alcohol use, knowledge about alcohol consumption, and related risks. Used questionnaires were the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) and the Drinking Motive Questionnaire-Revised (DMQ-R). Results: the AUDIT-C revealed that 53.3% of students were high-risk drinkers. Regarding binge drinking habits, 13.1% of students admitted to binge drinking behavior at least once a month. In our sample, male students are more likely to be low-risk drinkers than female peers (p < 0.008). Students from northern Italy are more likely to be high-risk drinkers (p = 0.003). Beer (65.9%) and wine (60.9%) were the most consumed alcoholic beverages. The most common places to drink alcohol were pubs (85.5%). The most likely motivations to drink alcohol were enhancement (40.43%), social (38.39%), coping (15.63%), and social pressure or conformity (5.55%). Only 43.8% of participants reported having attended an educational course on alcohol. Conclusions: University students were not fully aware of the implications of alcohol misuse and will be part of the adult society as critical figures and future leaders. It is imperative to inform students about alcohol consumption risks and investigate the motivations to drink. Stress, anxiety, and social pressure are only a few issues young people are exposed to.

This research has addressed the inhibitory potential of rutin against the Jab1 oncogene in SiHa cancer cells, which is known to inactivate various tumor suppressor proteins including p53 and p27. Further, the inhibitory efficacy of rutin via Jab1 expression modulation in cervical cancer has not been yet elucidated. Hence, we hypothesized that rutin could exhibit strong inhibitory efficacy against Jab1 and, thereby, induce significant growth arrest in SiHa cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. In our study, the cytotoxic efficacy of rutin on the proliferation of a cervical cancer cell line (SiHa) was exhibited using MTT and LDH assays. The correlation between rutin and Jab1 mRNA expression was assessed by RT-PCR analysis and the associated events (a mechanism) with this downregulation were then explored via performing ROS assay, DAPI analysis, and expression analysis of apoptosis-associated signaling molecules such as Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase-3 and -9 using qRT-PCR analysis. Results exhibit that rutin produces anticancer effects via inducing modulation in the expression of oncogenes as well as tumor suppressor genes. Further apoptosis induction, caspase activation, and ROS generation in rutin-treated SiHa cancer cells explain the cascade of events associated with Jab1 downregulation in SiHa cancer cells. Additionally, apoptosis induction was further confirmed by the FITC-Annexin V/PI double staining method. Altogether, our research supports the feasibility of developing rutin as one of the potent drug candidates in cervical cancer management via targeting one such crucial oncogene associated with cervical cancer progression.","Pandey, Pratibha; Khan, Fahad; Alzahrani, Faisal Abdulrahman; Qari, Huda A.; Oves, Mohammad",Molecules,142,1

METHODS AND RESULTS: In the CHILD (Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development) Cohort Study, we analyzed 2382 children with complete data on early life feeding and blood pressure. Infant feeding was documented from hospital records in the first few days of life and reported by mothers throughout infancy. Blood pressure was measured at 3 years of age. Analyses controlled for birth weight, gestational age, socioeconomic status, maternal body mass index, and other potential confounders. We found that nearly all children (2333/2382; 97.9%) were ever breastfed, of whom 98 (4.2%) only briefly received breast milk during their birth hospitalization (“early limited breastfeeding”). At 3 years of age, blood pressure was higher in children who were never breastfed (mean systolic/diastolic 103/60 mm Hg) compared with those who were ever breastfed (99/58 mm Hg), including those who received only early limited breastfeeding (99/57 mm Hg). These differences in systolic blood pressure persisted in adjusted models (ever breastfed: −3.47 mm Hg, 95% CI, −6.14 to −0.80; early limited breastfeeding: −4.24 mm Hg, 95% CI, −7.45 to −1.04). Among breastfed children, there was no significant dose‐response association according to the duration or exclusivity of breastfeeding. Associations were not mediated by child body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Although the benefits of sustained and exclusive breastfeeding are indisputable, this study indicates any breastfeeding, regardless of duration or exclusivity, is associated with lower blood pressure at 3 years of age. Further research examining the bioactive components of early breast milk, underlying mechanisms, and long‐term associations is warranted.","Miliku, Kozeta; Moraes, Theo J.; Becker, Allan B.; Mandhane, Piushkumar J.; Sears, Malcolm R.; Turvey, Stuart E.; Subbarao, Padmaja; Azad, Meghan B.",J Am Heart Assoc,142,1

Focusing on the ASA CAP Code Rules, we examined e-cigarette advertising regulation compliance in traditional advertising channels and on social media. METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of UK e-cigarette and related product advertising using a randomly selected sample (n = 130) of advertising in traditional channels and on Instagram which appeared between January and December 2019. All ads were independently double-coded to assess compliance with each CAP Code Rule. RESULTS: In traditional channels, our sample of advertising had largely good compliance. Only very small numbers of these ads appeared to be clearly in breach of any of the ASA rules (5% were in breach of Rule 22.7; 2% of Rule 22.9; and 1% of Rule 22.10). In contrast, we judged that all of the Instagram sample (n = 30) was in breach of Rule 22.12. For some rules, it was not possible to make definitive judgments about compliance, given uncertainty regarding how a rule should be interpreted and applied. CONCLUSIONS: We found overall good compliance for advertising in traditional channels, but assessed all of our social media advertising samples was in breach of regulations. Current guidance on e-cigarette advertising could be improved to facilitate e-cigarette advertising assessment and regulation. It would be beneficial to bring consumer perspectives into the assessment of regulation compliance. IMPLICATIONS: The regulation of e-cigarette advertising is a global concern. The UK Government has a statutory obligation to review the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations by May 2021. This study assessed compliance with current UK e-cigarette advertising regulations on placement and content. We identified areas where greater clarity is needed and outlined implications for future regulation.","Stead, Martine; Ford, Allison; Angus, Kathryn; MacKintosh, Anne Marie; Purves, Richard; Mitchell, Danielle",Nicotine Tob Res,142,1

Applying machine learning to address biological problems is expected to grow at an unprecedented rate, yet it is perceived by the uninitiated as a mysterious and daunting entity entrusted to the domain of mathematicians and computer scientists. The aim of this review is to identify key points required to start the journey of becoming an effective machine learning practitioner. These key points are further reinforced with an evaluation of how machine learning has been applied so far in a broad scope of real-life microbiology examples. This includes predicting drug targets or vaccine candidates, diagnosing microorganisms causing infectious diseases, classifying drug resistance against antimicrobial medicines, predicting disease outbreaks and exploring microbial interactions. Our hope is to inspire microbiologists and other related researchers to join the emerging machine learning revolution.","Goodswen, Stephen J; Barratt, Joel L N; Kennedy, Paul J; Kaufer, Alexa; Calarco, Larissa; Ellis, John T",FEMS Microbiol Rev,142,1

It has also been reported to diffuse into cerebrospinal fluid. We administered IV MOX to children (6 wks-4½ yrs) receiving conventional antimicrobial therapy for bacterial meningitis. Plasma and CSF specimens were collected 2 to 3 hours after a dose and assayed for MOX concentration by HPLC (capable of detecting 1 μg/ml of MOX). Eight patients received single doses of 15 or 25 mg/kg. In 11 determinations the plasma levels ranged between 4.7 and 29.4 μg/ml but MOX was detected in the CSF in only one instance. Eight patients received 50 mg/kg of MOX every 8 hours for 3 doses, and in 5 patients the drug diffused into CSF. MOX was detectable in 3/5 of CSF specimens early in the course of illness (2nd or 3rd day) and averaged 20% (range 2.5 to 30%) of plasma concentration. It was detectable in 5/11 of CSF specimens obtained later in the illness (13th to 22nd day) and averaged 15.7% (6 to 36%) of plasma concentration. There was no correlation between the diffusion of MOX into CSF and the CSF white cell count, however MOX diffused to a greater extent in patients with higher CSF protein content. In summary, MOX diffuses into CSF but such diffusion is unpredictable. Caution must be exercised in using MOX alone in the treatment of meningitis.","Thirumoorthi, M C; Buckley, Joyce A; Kauffman, Ralph E; Dajani, Adrian S",Pediatr Res,142,22

T lymphocytes first identified in the chordate lineage and constitute a highly sophisticated branch of adaptive immune system. Apart from B cells, it is the only cell type that exhibits antigenic specificities; achieved by gene rearrangement. T cells are unique with respect to diversity of their subsets, which have distinct effector specificities, proliferative abilities, memory generation, and life span. T cells are impactful in viral infections by virtue of their capability to combat intracellular pathogens. The effector functions of T cells are mediated through cytokines/chemokines and by direct cytotoxicity of infected cells. T cell response can be beneficial or detrimental to host; prognosis depending on qualitative and quantitative differences in the response. Persistent viral infections are associated with functionally suboptimal, exhausted T cell responses, which are unable to clear virus. Specific subsets such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) dampen antiviral responses; thereby favouring viral persistence. However, Tregs protect the host from immunopathology by limiting perpetual inflammation. Certain other subsets such as Th17 cells may contribute to autoimmune component of viral infections. The importance of T cells is highlighted by the fact that modern vaccination and therapeutic approaches focus on modulating T cell frequencies and effector functions. This chapter emphasises the understanding how T cells influence outcomes of viral infections, modern vaccination and therapeutic strategies with thrust on T cell biology.","Jagadeesh, Achanta; Prathyusha, A.

Kessler, MD, former FDA commissioner [1]. Screening donated blood for infectious diseases that can be transmitted through blood transfusion is a very important step in ensuring safety. The United States has the safest blood supply in the world [1] and the FDA is striving to keep it safe by decreasing the risk of infectious disease transmission. The regulatory agency is continuously updating its requirements and standards for collecting and processing blood. As mentioned earlier, an important step in ensuring safety is the screening of donated blood for infectious diseases. In the United States, tests for infectious diseases are routinely conducted on each unit of donated blood, and these tests are designed to comply with regulatory requirements (Table 28.1).

Microbial indoor exposure is a broader concept than microbial growth in buildings. Other sources of indoor microbial exposure include the outdoor environment, humans (crowdedness) and furry pet keeping. Microbial exposure can have different health effects depending on the dose, different exposure route, genetic disposition and the timing of exposure. Microbial stimulation linked to large microbial diversity in early life can protect against disease development, especially for allergic asthma and atopy. Protective effects are more often reported for bacterial exposure and adverse health effects are more often linked to mould exposure. There are many studies on health associations for indoor exposure to endotoxin, mainly from homes. The risk of getting atopic asthma may be less if you are exposed to endotoxin in childhood but the risk of non-atopic asthma may increase if exposed to endotoxin especially in adulthood. Moreover, genetic disposition modifies health effects of endotoxin. Epidemiological studies on muramic acid (from gram-positive bacteria) or ergosterol (from mould) are few. Studies on health effects of indoor exposure to beta-1-3-glucan (from mould) have conflicting results (positive as well as negative associations). Epidemiological studies on health effects of indoor exposure to mycotoxins are very few. Some studies have reported health associations for MVOC, but it is unclear to what extent MVOC has microbial sources in indoor environments. Many studies have reported health associations for fungal DNA, especially as a risk factor for childhood asthma at home. Since most studies on health effects of indoor exposure to mould, bacteria and microbial agents are cross-sectional, it is difficult to draw conclusions on causality.

In this chapter, we present a near real-time sentiment analysis service of public health-related tweets. Traditionally, it is impossible for humans to effectively measure the degree of public health concerns due to limited resources and significant time delays. To solve this problem, we have developed a computational intelligence approach for Epidemic Sentiment Monitoring System (ESMOS) to automatically analyze the disease sentiments and gauge the Measure of Concern (MOC) expressed by Twitter users. More specifically, we present a knowledge-based approach that employs a disease ontology to detect the outbreak of diseases and to analyze the linguistic expressions that convey subjective expressions and sentiment polarity of emotions, feelings, opinions, personal attitudes, etc. with a sentiment classifier. The two-step sentiment classification method utilizes the subjective vocabulary corpus (MPQA), sentiment strength corpus (AFINN), as well as emoticons and profanity words that are often used in social media postings. It first automatically classifies the tweets into personal and non-personal classes, eliminating many tweets such as non-personal “retweets” of news articles from further consideration. In the second stage, the personal tweets are classified into Negative and non-Negative sentiments. In addition, we present a model to quantify the public’s Measure of Concern (MOC) about a disease, based on sentiment classification results. The trends of the public MOC are visualized on a timeline. Correlation analyses between MOC timeline and disease-related sentiment category timelines show that the peaks of the MOC are weakly correlated with the peaks of the News timeline without any appreciable time delay or lead. Our sentiment analysis method and the MOC trend analyses can be generalized to other topical domains, such as mental health monitoring and crisis management. We present the ESMOS prototype for public health-related disease monitoring, for public concern trending and for mapping analyses.","Ji, Xiang; Chun, Soon Ae; Geller, James",Sentiment Analysis and Ontology Engineering,142,8

Postoperative period composed of pulmonary rehabilitation and analgesia includes breathing exercise, cough training, self-management education, and psychosocial support, and they have been shown to decrease complications. According to some new studies, paravertebral block has similar analgesic effects with thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA). Although paravertebral block has fewer adverse effects, TEA is still the gold standard for pain relief after thoracotomies. The incidence of pneumonia varies in the literature because there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of postoperative pneumonia. Many centers use only clinical criteria, whereas others use invasive diagnostic techniques. Empirical antibiotic treatment should be started based on patient factors, local infection, and susceptibility patterns.","Özcan, Perihan Ergin; Şentürk, Evren",Postoperative Care in Thoracic Surgery,142,17

One critical component that is required in such systems is a method to automatically determine how notable a certain news story is, in order to prioritize these stories during delivery. One way to do so is to compare each story in a stream of news stories to a notable event. In other words, the problem of detecting notable news can be defined as a ranking task; given a trusted source of notable events and a stream of candidate news stories, we aim to answer the question: “Which of the candidate news stories is most similar to the notable one?”. We employ different combinations of features and learning to rank (LTR) models and gather relevance labels using crowdsourcing. In our approach, we use structured representations of candidate news stories (triples) and we link them to corresponding entities. Our evaluation shows that the features in our proposed method outperform standard ranking methods, and that the trained model generalizes well to unseen news stories.","Saravanou, Antonia; Stefanoni, Giorgio; Meij, Edgar",Advances in Information Retrieval,142,1

Regardless of the nature of the emergency, the organizational response will be quite different when the emergency condition exists within the facility from when it occurs at some distant location. The actual emergency response programs of healthcare facilities indicate that much more effort has gone into a prepared response to external emergencies than to internal emergencies. Exceptions can be found in the areas of fire safety and bomb threat programs, in which various regulatory and accrediting agencies have considerable involvement. The planning and management of emergency incidents and conditions that healthcare organizations face daily come in many sizes, shapes, and colors. While some of these situations are intentionally created by man, others result from unintentional accidents, and still others are weather related.

A more effective and uniform approach to the prevention of these microbial threats is essential. The technological advances in the next generation sequencing field and decreasing costs of these tests provide novel opportunities in understanding the dynamics of infection—even in real time—through the analysis of microbial genome diversity. The projected significant increase in whole (microbial) genome sequencing (WGS) will likely also enable a much better understanding of the pathogenesis of the infection and the molecular basis of the host response to infection. But the full potential of these advances will only transpire if the data in this area become transferable and thereby comparable, preferably in open-source systems. There is therefore an obvious need to develop a global system of whole microbial genome databases to aggregate, share, mine and use microbiological genomic data, to address global public health and clinical challenges, and most importantly to identify and diagnose infectious diseases. The global microbial identifier (GMI) initiative, aims to build a database of whole microbial genome sequencing data linked to relevant metadata, which can be used to identify microorganisms, their communities and the diseases they cause. It would be a platform for storing whole genome sequencing (WGS) data of microorganisms, for the identification of relevant genes and for the comparison of genomes to detect outbreaks and emerging pathogens. To harness the full potential of WGS, a shared global database of genomes linked to relevant metadata and the necessary software tools needs to be generated, hence the global microbial identifier (GMI) initiative. This tool will ideally be used in amongst others in the diagnosis of infectious diseases in humans and animals, in the identification of microorganisms in food and environment, and to track and trace microbial agents in all arenas globally. This will require standardization and extensive investments in computational analytical tools. In addition, the wider introduction of WGS in clinical diagnostics can accelerate developments in health care in many poor countries. This overview describes the growing network of stakeholders behind GMI, the contours of the database, and the IT structures needed to serve the GMI user community. It discusses what essentially can be done by a global GMI tool and how the GMI organization could help achieve these goals.","Wielinga, Peter R.; Hendriksen, Rene S.; Aarestrup, Frank M.; Lund, Ole; Smits, Saskia L.; Koopmans, Marion P.

After that thermophilous deciduous forests gradually crowded out the birch woods and reached their optimum in the Atlantic Period. The lakes were increasingly filled with peat, the eutraphent character of the marsh vegetation weakened and ombrogenous bog communities spread across the region. Shortly before the Sub‐Boreal Period the first indications of human interference in the forests were detectable.

It follows then that computation using musical models can provide results that are analogous to results provided by mathematical, physical, and psychological models. The audible output of a carefully constructed musical model can demonstrate properties and relationships in a way that is immediately perceptible. For this reason, the study of musical computation is a worthwhile pursuit as a pedagogical tool for computational science. Proposed in this paper is a curriculum for implementing the study of musical computation within a larger computer science or computational science program at a college or university. A benefit of such a curriculum is that it provides a way to integrate artistic endeavors into a STREAM program, while maintaining the mathematical foundations of STEM. Furthermore, the study of musical computation aligns well with the arts-related components of Human-Centered Computing. The curriculum is built on the following two hypotheses: The first hypothesis is that the cognitive, creative, and structural processes involved in both musical composition and computer programming, are similar enough that skilled computer scientists, with or without musical backgrounds, can learn to use programming languages to compose interesting, expressive, and sophisticated musical works. The second hypothesis is that the links between music, mathematics, and several branches of science are strong enough that skilled computational scientists can create musical models that are able to be designed using vocabularies of mathematics and science. While the curriculum defined in this paper focuses on musical computation, the design principles behind it may be applied to other disciplines.","Roth, Richard; Pierce, William",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,142,1

Depending on a chosen application scenario, a model generator has to fulfill different requirements: As a modeling language is usually defined by a meta-model, all generated models are expected to conform to their meta-models. For performance tests of model-driven engineering techniques, the efficient generation of large models should be supported. When generating several models, the resulting set of models should show some diversity. Interactive model generation may help in producing relevant models. In this paper, we present a rule-based, configurable approach to automate model generation which addresses the stated requirements. Our model generator produces valid instance models of meta-models with multiplicities conforming to the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). An evaluation of the model generator shows that large EMF models (with up to half a million elements) can be produced. Since the model generation is rule-based, it can be configured beforehand or during the generation process to produce sets of models that are diverse to a certain extent.","Nassar, Nebras; Kosiol, Jens; Kehrer, Timo; Taentzer, Gabriele",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,142,19

Few studies have assessed factors associated with the value of HIE through its actual use. This study investigates provider perceptions on HIE comparing those who had prior experience vs those who had no experience with it. In so doing, we identify six constructs: prior use, system complexity, system concerns, public/population health, care delivery, and provider performance. This study uses a mixed methods approach to data collection. From 15 interviews of medical community leaders, a survey was constructed and administered to 263 clinicians. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance was used, along with Tukey HSD tests for multiple comparisons. Results indicated providers whom previously used HIE had more positive perceptions about its benefits in terms of system complexity (p = .001), care delivery (p = .000), population health (p = .003), and provider performance (p = .005); women providers were more positive in terms of system concerns (p = .000); patient care (p = .031), and population health (p = .009); providers age 44–55 were more positive than older and younger groups in terms of patient care (p = .032), population health (p = .021), and provider performance (p = .014); while differences also existed across professional license groups (physician, nurse, other license, admin (no license)) for all five constructs (p < .05); and type of organization setting (hospital, ambulatory clinic, medical office, other) for three constructs including system concerns (p = .017), population health (p = .018), and provider performance (p = .018). There were no statistically significant differences found between groups based on a provider’s role in an organization (patient care, administration, teaching/research, other). Different provider perspectives about the value derived from HIE use exist depending on prior experience with HIE, age, gender, license (physician, nurse, other license, admin (no license)), and type of organization setting (hospital, ambulatory clinic, medical office, other). This study draws from the theory of planned behavior to understand factors related to physicians’ perceptions about HIE value, serving as a departure point for more detailed investigations of provider perceptions and behavior in regard to future HIE use and promoting interoperability.","Feldman, Sue S.; Hikmet, Neset; Modi, Shikha; Schooley, Benjamin",Inf Syst Front,142,19

However, empirically determined NIV settings may not achieve optimal ventilatory support. Therefore, the efficacy of NIV should be systematically monitored. The minimal recommended monitoring strategy includes clinical assessment, arterial blood gases (ABG) and nocturnal transcutaneous pulsed oxygen saturation (SpO(2)). Polysomnography is a theoretical gold standard but is not routinely available in many centers. Simple tools such as transcutaneous capnography (TcPCO(2)) or ventilator built-in software provide reliable informations but their role in NIV monitoring has yet to be defined. The aim of our work was to compare the accuracy of different combinations of tests to assess NIV efficacy. METHODS: This retrospective comparative study evaluated the efficacy of NIV in consecutive patients through four strategies (A, B, C and D) using four different tools in various combinations. These tools included morning ABG, nocturnal SpO(2), TcPCO(2) and data provided by built-in software via a dedicated module. Strategy A (ABG + nocturnal SpO(2)), B (nocturnal SpO(2) + TcPCO(2)) and C (TcPCO(2) + builtin software) were compared to strategy D, which combined all four tools (NIV was appropriate if all four tools were normal). RESULTS: NIV was appropriate in only 29 of the 100 included patients. Strategy A considered 53 patients as appropriately ventilated. Strategy B considered 48 patients as appropriately ventilated. Strategy C misclassified only 6 patients with daytime hypercapnia. CONCLUSION: Monitoring ABG and nocturnal SpO(2) is not enough to assess NIV efficacy. Combining data from ventilator built-in software and TcPCO(2) seems to represent the best strategy to detect poor NIV efficacy.

Most preliminary care series report rapid clinical progression and higher mortality compared to the general population. METHODS: Retrospective study at Harper University Hospital - Detroit Medical Center. Twenty-five renal transplant recipients (RTR) presenting consecutively with COVID-19 symptoms and positive NP swab PCR for SARS-CoV2 between 03/01/2020 - 05/01/2020 were included. Data on demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, management and outcomes were collected. RESULTS: All 25 patients were hospitalized. Patients had a median age of 56, all African American and deceased donor transplant recipients. Most had hypertension (96%), about half (52%) had diabetes, 64% had pulmonary disease including obstructive sleep apnea, COPD and pulmonary hypertension. Most common presenting symptom was dyspnea (64%), followed by fever and cough (56%) and diarrhea (56%). One-half of patients had multifocal opacities on initial chest x-ray (52%). Immunosuppression with tacrolimus and low dose prednisone was continued, while mycophenolate mofetil was held on admission. Following institution guidelines, hydroxychloroquine was given to 32%, while 48% received both hydroxychloroquine and steroids. Prophylactic anticoagulation was given to 80% of patients and therapeutic coagulation to 8%. Oxygen supplementation given to 60% of patients and one patient required intubation. Three patients (12%) required transfer to the intensive care unit, one expired. At follow-up, treatment with mycophenolate was reintroduced based on resolution of symptoms and laboratory parameters. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infected RTR in this small cohort had lower mortality of 4% (n=1) compared to State-wide mortality of 10%. Despite multiple co-morbidities and chronic immunosuppression, our patient cohort had excellent prognosis and lower mortality compared to other series. Exact reasons for this optimal outcome are explored.

Despite five National Patient Safety Alerts since 2005, “Never Events” related to nasogastric feeding persist. In addition to placement errors, current practice often leads to delays in feeding, which subsequently result in worse patient outcomes. It is crucial that tube placement is confirmed accurately and in a timely way. Medical advancements in this area have been slow to find a solution which meets this need.

Nowadays, it is difficult to find a job where no ICT skills are required. At the same time, there is a lack of ecosystems for adult reskilling in digital competence. Moreover, most of them do not use of a common language and terminology, decreasing the possibilities of being used by a wider public. In addition, the assessment of digital competence cannot be done using simple self-assessment tests, but more complex tools such as simulations or other activities based on real scenarios. Considering this, we designed a performance-based evaluation system following a pragmatic approach based on DigComp framework. We carried out a needs analysis based on expert consultation (63 teleworkers and 82 entrepreneurs) to create an assessment syllabus and implement the assessment modules. Then, we conducted an analysis by experts (n = 21) of the relationship between the content of the tests and the construct it was intended to measure. After refinement, the system was piloted by end-users all over Europe (n = 525). Results confirmed that DigComp was the most appropriate reference when considering the transversality of digital competence, providing researchers with well-defined clear criteria.

Each section opens with a popular song that was freshly reimagined during the 2019 anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests. First, I argue that Bangladeshis, as signifiers of death, kill the Assamese subjectivity while staging a cause to become Assamese in the first place. Their presence represents our inability to recoup Assam’s many losses, inducing melancholic helplessness in the ethnos. Second, I illustrate how middle-class households internalise certain immigrants as domestic helps, appropriating their emotional and material labour in private to claim hegemony in public politics. Third, I demonstrate why Assam is doomed to extinguish its revolutions before they happen.

Our purpose is to examine how it affected the epidemiology of pediatric fractures in a tertiary hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study comparing the epidemiology and management of pediatric fractures in our centre during the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to the previous year. The ""pandemic"" cohort includes patients seen during this state of alarm (03/14/2020 to 06/21/20); and the ""pre-pandemic"" cohort the same period of 2019. RESULTS: Between both periods, 233 pediatric patients were treated for 258 fractures. There were no significant changes in their age or sex. The incidence of fractures was decreased by 66%. Despite this decrease, the percentage of fractures that required surgical intervention doubled. The time until the evaluation in the emergency room was also modified, with a higher proportion of patients seen more than 24 hours after the trauma. Regarding the anatomical locations, a reduction in bicortical fractures stands out, in contrast to greenstick fractures and epiphysiolysis. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the epidemiology of pediatric fractures. There was a reduction in the incidence of fractures and a delay in hospital care, probably due to fear of going to the hospital due to the risk of contagion. Home confinement may justify the lower proportion of high-energy distal radius fractures, such as bicortical fractures.","Meneses Gutiérrez, A; Lanuza Lagunilla, L; Suárez-Anta Rodríguez, P J; Camblor Valladares, Á; García Arias, A; Cabria Fernández, J; García Cuello, L; Mateo Negreira, J",Br J Surg,142,10

In this study, we evaluated longitudinal serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as to COVID-19 vaccination in IBD patients. METHODS: We collected clinical data and sera from IBD patients enrolled in an observational SARS-CoV-2 sero-surveillance study at our large hospital center in New York City during routine infusions and clinic visits. To distinguish between infection and vaccination, sera was collected prior to vaccination where possible, and all sera was tested for both antibodies to SARS-CoV-2-specific RBD, the target of current available vaccines in the U.S., and nucleocapsid proteins. RESULTS: Our results reveal waning antibody titres in 13 of 16 (81%) patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 over a course of 6-7 months. Of 48 vaccinated patients, 16 patients completed vaccine schedules with two doses, and all 16 (100%) achieved seroconversion above the threshold required for convalescent plasma donation. CONCLUSION: While antibody responses to infection in IBD patients have questionable stability, completion of the COVID-19 vaccine series in IBD patients results in robust serological responses. To our knowledge is the first data confirming adequate serological responses to COVID-19 vaccination in IBD patients with and without biologic medications. Studies are needed to assess adequacy of dosing schedules, medication effects, measurement of cell-mediated responses, durability of immune responses, and clinical efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in IBD patients.","Wong, S Y; Dixon, R; Gold, S; Vicky, M; Helmus, D; Cadwell, K; Colombel, J F",J Crohns Colitis,142,11

Obesity is one of the major comorbidities that are related to complications in the course of the disease. Obesity is characterized by a chronic low grade of inflammation and it is proposed that abnormal gut microbiota together with increased gut permeability are risk factors of this pathology. The aim of the present study was to conduct a descriptive research and investigate about the imbalance in the gastrointestinal microbiota (dysbiosis) in patients with COVID‐19 and obesity. A library research using the electronic databases PubMed and Google Scholar was performed. The full search strategy combined terms from three themes: COVID‐19, obesity, and gut microbiota. Terms were searched as both keywords (title/abstract words) and a comprehensive list of MeSH terms related to each theme. Titles and abstracts were reviewed for relevance and then screened considering the full text content. Network maps were also generated to evaluate the co‐ocurrence terms in the papers analyzed using VOSviewer 1.6.14 software. Several studies indicate that gut microbiota is altered in COVID‐19 patients showing a decrease in abundance and diversity. Different opportunistic pathogens were found increased in COVID‐19 patients including Collinsella, Streptococcus, Morganella, Rothia, Veillonella, Erysipelatoclostridium, Actinomyces, Coprobacillus and Clostridium. Many of them were associated with an increased in SARS‐CoV‐2 infectivity, inflammatory markers, or COVID‐19 disease severity. Fecal fungal microbiome was also altered showing an enrichment of fungal pathogens from the genera Candida and Aspergillus. There is a correlation between the bacterial species present in the gut microbiota of COVID‐19 patients and in patients with obesity. This was observed principally in the increment of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria and the decrease of Bacteroidetes. Modulation of gut microbiota with prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics are suggested to be used in patients with COVID‐19. The present study contributes to highlight the importance of gastrointestinal microflora in COVID‐19 patients with obesity as well as the necessity to study specifically this population which report a higher risk of COVID‐19 morbidity and mortality. Further studies are needed to evaluate potential treatments to reestablish gut microbiome, reduce inflammation, and improve immune function considering the persistence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the gastrointestinal tract.","Massip Copiz, María Macarena",FASEB J,142,1

Specifically, we investigated how the visual aesthetics of positive emotional interface design influenced learners’ cognitive processes, emotional valences, learning outcomes, and subjective experience. Eighty-one college students took part in the experimental study. They were divided into the three experimental groups: a holistic layout of positive emotional design group (HPED), a local layout of positive emotional design group (LPED), and a neutral emotional design group (ND). By using a mixed approach of questionnaires and eye tracking, we further explored the differences among the three groups in cognitive processing, learning outcomes, and subjective experience. Results indicated that the LPED group invested higher cognitive effort, put more attentional focus in the relevant knowledge content module, and achieved better learning performance (i.e., retention and transfer tests) in contrast to the HPED group and the ND group. However, no significant difference in dynamic changes of emotional state among the three groups was detected. The analytical results can provide researchers and practitioners with valuable insights into the positive emotional design of multimedia learning, which allows for the facilitation of mental engagement, learning outcomes and subjective perception.","Peng, Xian; Xu, Qinmei; Chen, Yufan; Zhou, Chenying; Ge, Yuqing; Li, Na",Int J Educ Technol High Educ,142,1

The pathogen causing this pandemic was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is well known that SARS-CoV-2 transmits via respiratory droplets and close contact with infected individuals or contaminated items. In addition to these two major transmission routes, other modes of transmission have not been confirmed. Considering that some COVID-19 patients have presented with ocular discomforts and positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in ocular surfaces, as well as the discovery of the SARS-CoV-2 receptors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and transmembrane protease, serine 2, in the oculus, the ocular surface is now thought to be a possible alternative route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and a replication site. This review summarizes the evidence connecting COVID-19 with ocular tissues, ocular symptoms during SARS-CoV-2 infection, the potential role of the conjunctiva in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and the physiopathological mechanisms. Appropriate precautions in ophthalmology departments, including innovative complete and effective patient management plans, protective personal equipment, hand hygiene, and strict personal distance intervals, are essential to effectively minimize the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and control the pandemic.","Ran, Hong Li; Zhou, Xiang Tian; Liu, William J.; Gao, George F.",,142,18

Based on a survey of 30 Romanian management consulting companies and a qualitative comparative analysis, we model the relationship between management consulting companies’ current context (customers’ industries, internal and external triggers for digital transformation), the current state of digital transformation, and expected digital transformation. By considering managerial expectations importance in future decisions, and contingency theory for explaining the links between context, current state and expected digital transformation, different paths concerning digital transformation are identified at Romanian management consulting companies. For some of them, the combination of internal and external triggers and the existence of previous digital transformation activities led to increases in the recognized importance of digital transformation in future business models and to newer business services (digital strategy). For others, which do not have powerful external triggers, digital transformation is associated with internal efficiency–related triggers, and it targets only improvements in existing business models due to technology adoption (technology strategy). A small number of management consulting companies do not expect digital transformation to have a large impact on their future business model, because of either the lack of external triggers to do so or the absence of previous digital transformation activities. This research demonstrates the contingency and evolutionary nature of the digital transformation process, in which specific combinations between internal and external triggers can explain the expectations of management consulting companies’ managers about digital transformation.","Crișan, Emil Lucian; Stanca, Liana",Inf Syst E-Bus Manage,142,1

This work made it possible to derive the characteristics of the model from previous case studies and applications with real data, and to link the reasoning techniques to concrete approaches used by intelligence analysts such as, for example, the Structured Analytic Techniques. The model allows to represent an operational situation according to three complementary perspectives: descriptive, relational and behavioral. These three perspectives are instantiated on the basis of the principles and methods of Granular Computing, mainly based on the theories of fuzzy and rough sets, and with the help of further structures such as graphs.

Traditional methods such as comparing the features’ cosine similarity and exploring the datasets manually to check which feature vector is suitable is relatively time consuming. Many classification tasks failed to achieve better classification results because of poor feature vector selection and sparseness of data. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework, topic2features (T2F), to deal with short and sparse data using the topic distributions of hidden topics gathered from dataset and converting into feature vectors to build supervised classifier. For this we leveraged the unsupervised topic modelling LDA (latent dirichlet allocation) approach to retrieve the topic distributions employed in supervised learning algorithms. We made use of labelled data and topic distributions of hidden topics that were generated from that data. We explored how the representation based on topics affect the classification performance by applying supervised classification algorithms. Additionally, we did careful evaluation on two types of datasets and compared them with baseline approaches without topic distributions and other comparable methods. The results show that our framework performs significantly better in terms of classification performance compared to the baseline(without T2F) approaches and also yields improvement in terms of F1 score compared to other compared approaches.","Wahid, Junaid Abdul; Shi, Lei; Gao, Yufei; Yang, Bei; Tao, Yongcai; Wei, Lin; Hussain, Shabir",PeerJ Comput Sci,142,1

The diagnosis of the disease is done via a visual inspection of the lesional skin by dermatologists. Classification of psoriasis using gene expression is an important issue for the early and effective treatment of the disease. Therefore, gene expression data and selection of suitable gene signatures are effective sources of information. METHODS: We aimed to develop a hybrid classifier for the diagnosis of psoriasis based on two machine learning models of the genetic algorithm and support vector machine (SVM). The method also conducts gene signature selection. A publically available gene expression dataset was used to test the model. RESULTS: A number of 181 probe sets were selected among the original 54,675 probes using the hybrid model with a prediction accuracy of 100% over the test set. A number of 10 hub genes were identified using the protein-protein interaction network. Nine out of 10 identified genes were found in significant modules. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the genetic algorithm improved the SVM classifier performance significantly implying the ability of the proposed model in terms of detecting relevant gene expression signatures as the best features.","Tapak, Leili; Afshar, Saeid; Afrasiabi, Mahlagha; Ghasemi, Mohammad Kazem; Alirezaei, Pedram",Biomed Res Int,142,1

The invasiveness and need for trained personnel make the NP technique unsuited for repeated community-based mass screening. We developed a technique to collect saliva in a simple and easy way with the sponges that are usually used for tamponade of epistaxis. This study was carried out to validate the clinical performance of oral sponge (OS) sampling for SARS-CoV-2 testing. METHODS: Over a period of 22 weeks, we collected prospectively 409 paired NP and OS samples from consecutive subjects presenting to a public community-based free screening center. Subjects were referred by their attending physician because of recent COVID-19 symptoms (n=147) or by the contact tracing staff of the French public health insurance since they were considered as close contacts of a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case (n=262). RESULTS: In symptomatic subjects, RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing with OS showed a 96.5% (95%CI: 89.6–94.8) concordance with NP testing, and, a 93.2% (95%CI: 89.1–97.3)] sensitivity when using the IdyllaTM platform and a sensitivity of 76.3% [69.4–83.2] on the Synlab Barla laboratory platform. In close contacts the NP-OS concordance (93.8% [95%CI: 90.9–96.7]) and OS sensitivity (71.9% [95%CI: 66.5–77.3]) were slightly lower. CONCLUSION: These results strongly suggest that OS testing is a straightforward, low-cost and high-throughput sampling method that can be used for frequent RT-PCR testing of COVID-19 patients and mass screening of populations.","Boutros, Jacques; Benzaquen, Jonathan; Marquette, Charles Hugo; Ilié, Marius; Labaky, Mickelina; Benchetrit, Didier; Lavrut, Thibaut; Leroy, Sylvie; Chemla, Richard; Carles, Michel; Tanga, Virginie; Maniel, Charlotte; Bordone, Olivier; Allégra, Maryline; Lespinet, Virginie; Fayada, Julien; Griffonnet, Jennifer; Hofman, Véronique; Hofman, Paul",ERJ Open Res,142,1

The optimization of drug dosing may improve treatment outcomes, reduce toxicity, and reduce the risk of developing drug resistance. To adequately implement TDM, accurate and precise analytical procedures are required. In clinical practice, blood is the most commonly used matrix for TDM; however, less invasive samples, such as dried blood spots or non-invasive saliva samples, are increasingly being used. The choice of sample preparation method, type of column packing, mobile phase composition, and detection method is important to ensure accurate drug measurement and to avoid interference from matrix effects and drug metabolites. Most of the reported procedures used liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques due to its high selectivity and sensitivity. High-performance chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) methods are also used when a simpler and more cost-effective methodology is desired for clinical monitoring. The application of high-performance chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) with and without derivatization processes and high-performance chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED) techniques for the analysis of various drugs in biological samples for TDM have been described less often. Before chromatographic analysis, samples were pretreated by various procedures-most often by protein precipitation, liquid-liquid extraction, and solid-phase extraction, rarely by microextraction by packed sorbent, dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction. The aim of this article is to review the recent literature (2010-2020) regarding the use of liquid chromatography with various detection techniques for TDM.","Tuzimski, Tomasz; Petruczynik, Anna",Molecules,142,30

To reduce that risk, guidelines recommend to systematically perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) before extubation in order to mimic the postextubation physiological conditions. SBT is usually performed with a T-piece disconnecting the patient from the ventilator or with low levels of pressure-support ventilation (PSV). However, work of breathing is lower during PSV than during T-piece. Consequently, while PSV trial may hasten extubation, it may also increase the risk of reintubation. We hypothesise that, compared with T-piece, SBT performed using PSV may hasten extubation without increasing the risk of reintubation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This study is an investigator-initiated, multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing T-piece vs PSV for SBTs in patients at high risk of reintubation in ICUs. Nine hundred patients will be randomised with a 1:1 ratio in two groups according to the type of SBT. The primary outcome is the number of ventilator-free days at day 28, defined as the number of days alive and without invasive mechanical ventilation between the initial SBT (day 1) and day 28. Secondary outcomes include the number of days between the initial SBT and the first extubation attempt, weaning difficulty, the number of patients extubated after the initial SBT and not reintubated within the following 72 hours, the number of patients extubated within the 7 days following the initial SBT, the number of patients reintubated within the 7 days following extubation, in-ICU length of stay and mortality in ICU, at day 28 and at day 90. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The study has been approved by the central ethics committee 'Ile de France V' (2019-A02151-56) and patients will be included after informed consent. The results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

In adults the staircase phenomenon can be avoided by tetanic prestimulation. This study examined, if tetanic prestimulation eliminates the staircase phenomenon in children. After written informed consent, the neuromuscular function of 80 children, 10 in each age group (< 6 months, 6-12 months, 12-24 months, 2-3 years, 3-6 years, 6-12 years, 12-18 years, and ≥ 18 years) was measured on both arms simultaneously over 30 min under general anaesthesia. The ulnaris nerve was stimulated using the TOF technique every 15 s. The twitch response (T1, TOF ratio [TOFR]) was measured by acceleromyography. Before calibration, tetanic prestimmulation (50 Hz for 5 s) was administered to one randomly selected arm. The effect of tetanic prestimulation and age was analysed using general linear models based on the normalized T1 and TOFRs of both arms. Tetanic prestimulation significantly affected T1 values avoiding the staircase phenomenon (p < 0.0001). After 5.8 min [1.0-17.2 min] the normalized T1 values increased to 117% [102-147%] without prestimulation (p < 0.0001) independent of the age group (p = 0.539). The normalized TOFR was stable throughout the observation period of 30 min 100% [95-107%]. Infants (> 12 weeks), children, and young adults (< 18 years) develop similar characteristics of the staircase phenomenon than adults. Tetanic prestimulation prevents the staircase phenomenon in these age groups. The stability of the TOFR reading confirms its value to monitor neuromuscular function over time.Registration: The study was registered as NCT02552875 on Clinical Trials.gov on July 29, 2014.","Unterbuchner, Christoph; Werkmann, Markus; Ziegleder, Raphael; Kraus, Stephanie; Seyfried, Timo; Graf, Bernhard; Zeman, Florian; Blobner, Manfred; Sinner, Barbara; Metterlein, Thomas",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,142,9

It is surrounded by critical nuclear structures (the hypothalamus and thalami) and important glandular structures (the pituitary and pineal glands). Although a wide array of pathologic processes may involve the third ventricle, most are extrinsic masses. By understanding the anatomic boundaries of the third ventricle and its relationship to adjacent structures, it is possible to create short lists of differential diagnoses. Third ventricle masses can be classified as arising in or immediately adjacent to one of five locations: anterior, posterior, inferior, foramen of Monro, and intraventricular. Anterior masses involve the optic and infundibular recesses, posterior masses affect or arise in the posterior commissure and pineal gland, and inferior masses involve or affect the ventricle floor. Masses may also arise at or adjacent to the foramen of Monro or entirely within the third ventricle. Of the intraventricular masses, chordoid glioma-a rare low-grade primary neoplasm-is unique to the third ventricle. Congenital malformations of the third ventricle are uncommon and are most often noted during childhood.

METHODS We compared glycemic metrics during lockdown with the same period of 2019. The psychological impact was evaluated with the Test of Anxiety and Depression. RESULTS We analyzed metrics of 117 adolescents (87% on Multiple Daily Injections and 100% were flash glucose monitoring/continuous glucose monitoring users). During the lockdown, we observed an increase of the percentage of time in range (TIR) (p<0.001), with a significant reduction of time in moderate (p=0.002), and severe hypoglycemia (p=0.001), as well as the percentage of time in hyperglycemia (p<0.001). Glucose variability did not differ (p=0.863). The glucose management indicator was lower (p=0.001). 7% of youths reached the threshold-score (≥115) for anxiety and 16% for depression. A higher score was associated with lower TIR [p=0.028, p=0.012]. CONCLUSIONS Glycemic control improved during the first lockdown period with respect to the previous year. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with worse glycemic control; future researches are necessary to establish if this improvement is transient and if psychological difficulties will increase during the prolonged pandemic situation.","Cusinato, Maria; Martino, Mariangela; Sartori, Alex; Gabrielli, Claudia; Tassara, Laura; Debertolis, Giulia; Righetto, Elena; Moretti, Carlo",Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,142,1

The maximum R2O3 content of light rare-earth compounds reached 63 mol % and decreased with a decrease in the ionic radius of R3+. The thermal, optical, vibrational, and structural properties were investigated, particularly for 50R2O3-50B2O3 glasses. The glass transition temperature increased with a decrease in the ionic radius of R3+, while the thermal stability was not affected by the glass composition. The packing density increased with a decrease in the ionic radius of R3+ due to lanthanoid contraction. Raman scattering and Fourier transform infrared spectra revealed that, in the rare-earth-rich glasses, no conventional three-dimensional networks consisting of corner-sharing BOn (n = 3 or 4) units existed because all B atoms were formed as isolated BO3 units. The simple environment around B atoms in the glasses led to additional IR transmittance regions, irrespective of the kinds of R. The total correlation functions obtained from high-energy X-ray diffraction measurements were analyzed using the pair-function method and compared with those of various RBO3 crystalline phases. It was suggested that the local structure around R resembles the ν-NdBO3-type crystal structure, and the O coordination number of R ranged from 6.5 to 7.7, smaller than that of the crystalline phase. The glass-forming ability depending on R was discussed based on the structural similarities between the melt, glass, and crystalline phases.","Sasaki, Shunta; Masuno, Atsunobu; Ohara, Koji; Yanaba, Yutaka; Inoue, Hiroyuki; Watanabe, Yasuhiro; Kohara, Shinji",Inorganic chemistry,142,22

The purpose of this study was to determine if, and to what extent, radiofrequency energy couples to other common laparoscopic instruments and to describe practical steps that can minimize the magnitude of antenna coupling. METHODS In a laparoscopic simulator, monopolar radiofrequency energy was delivered to an L-hook. The tips of standard, nonelectrical laparoscopic instruments (either an unlit 10 mm telescope or a 5 mm grasper) were placed adjacent to bovine liver tissue and were never in contact with the active electrode. Thermal imaging quantified the change in tissue temperature nearest the tip of the telescope or grasper at the end of a 5 s activation of the active electrode. RESULTS A 5 s activation (30 watts, coagulation mode, 4 cm separation between instruments) increased tissue temperature compared with baseline adjacent to the grasper tip (2.2 ± 2.2 °C; p = 0.013) and telescope tip (38.2 ± 8.0 °C; p < 0.001). The laparoscopic telescope tip increased tissue temperature more than the laparoscopic grasper tip (p < 0.001). Lowering the generator power from 30 to 15 Watts decreased the heat generated at the telescope tip (38.2 ± 8.0 vs. 13.5 ± 7.5 °C; p < 0.001). Complete separation of the camera/light cords and the active electrode cord decreased the heat generated near the telescope tip compared with parallel bundling of the cords (38.2 ± 8.0 vs. 15.7 ± 11.6 °C; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Commonly used laparoscopic instruments couple monopolar radiofrequency energy without direct contact with the active electrode, a phenomenon that results in heat transfer from a nonelectrically active instrument tip to adjacent tissue. Practical steps to minimize heat transfer resulting from antenna coupling include reducing the monopolar generator power setting and avoiding of parallel bundling of the telescope and active electrode cords.","Jones, Edward L; Robinson, Thomas N; McHenry, Jennifer R; Dunn, Christina L; Montero, Paul N; Govekar, Henry R; Stiegmann, Greg V",Surgical endoscopy,142,1

Moreover, our results revealed that arsenic can reduce global acetylation of histone H4 at K16 (H4K16 ac) in lymphocytes via decreasing the level of males absent on the first but upregulates mRNA and protein levels of the forkhead/winged-helix box P3 (Foxp3) gene by increasing the acetylation of histone H4 at K16 (H4K16) at the promoter of Foxp3. Finally, arsenic-induced dysfunction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) could be ameliorated by trichostatin A.

All patients but one required hospitalization. Ten patients (83%) were discharged following a mean of 16.4±9.7 days of hospitalization. Two patients were diagnosed while hospitalized for other conditions, and these were the only patients who died. Those who died were older than those who survived. CONCLUSION The incidence of COVID-19 in our HDU in Madrid at the height of the pandemic was high, especially in patients on peritoneal dialysis. No potential benefit for preventing the infection in patients on home dialysis was observed. Advanced age and nosocomial transmission were the main factors linked to a worse prognosis.","Maldonado, María; Ossorio, Marta; Del Peso, Gloria; Santos, Carlos; Álvarez, Laura; Sánchez-Villanueva, Rafael; Rivas, Begoña; Vega, Cristina; Selgas, Rafael; Bajo, María A",Nefrologia : publicacion oficial de la Sociedad Espanola Nefrologia,142,30

OBJECTIVE To compare outcomes between M1 and M2 occlusions in the Analysis of Revascularization in Ischemic Stroke with EmboTrap (ARISE II) trial. METHODS We performed a prespecified analysis of the ARISE II trial with the primary outcome of 90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2, which we termed good outcome. Secondary outcomes included reperfusion rates and major adverse events. The primary predictor was M2 occlusion, which we compared with M1 occlusion. RESULTS We included 183 patients, of whom 126 (69%) had M1 occlusion and 57 (31%) had M2 occlusion. There was no difference in the reperfusion rates or adverse events between M2 and M1 occlusions. The rate of good outcome was not different in M2 versus M1 occlusions (70.2% vs 69.7%, p=0.946). In a logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex, and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, M2 occlusions did not have a significantly different odds of good outcome compared with M1 occlusions (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.88, p=0.87). CONCLUSION In ARISE II, M2 occlusions achieved a 70.2% rate of good outcome at 90 days, which is above published rates for untreated M2 occlusions and superior to prior reports of M2 occlusions treated with endovascular thrombectomy. We also report similar rates of good outcome, successful reperfusion, death, and other adverse events when comparing the M1 and M2 occlusions.","de Havenon, Adam; Narata, Ana Paula; Amelot, Aymeric; Saver, Jeffrey L; Bozorgchami, Hormozd; Mattle, Heinrich Paul; Ribo, Marc; Andersson, Tommy; Zaidat, Osama O",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,142,15

In this study, we identified the hub genes (hub miRNA genes) associated with hypertension and explored the relationship between hypertension miRNA-gene by constructing a mRNA co-expression network and a miRNA co-expression network, which can help to reveal the mechanism and predict the prognosis of hypertension progression. MATERIAL AND METHODS Based on gene expression profile data of hypertensive samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, WGCNA was used to detect hypertension-related biomarkers and key mRNA and miRNA modules. Then, DAVID was used to perform gene-annotation enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and miRPath were used for pathway analysis of mRNA and miRNAs genes. RESULTS We identified 3 key modules relating to hypertension, 2 mRNA modules named Msaddlebrown and Mgreenyellow and 1 miRNA module named Msalmon. In addition, 12 hub genes (RPL21, RPS28, LOC442727/PTGAP10, LOC100129599/RPS29P14, TBXAS1, FCER1G, CFP, FURIN, PECAM1, IGSF6, NCF1C, and LOC285296/UNC93B3) and 7 hub miRNAs (hsa-miR-1268a/b, hsa-miR-513c-3p, hsa-miR-4799-5p, hsa-miR-296-3p, hsa-miR-5195-5p, hsa-miR-219-2-3p, and hsa-miR-548d-5p) relating to hypertension were identified. HIF-1 signaling pathway and insulin signaling pathway were closely related to the 3 key modules. We also discovered 4 miRNAs (hsa-miR-548am-3p, hsa-miR-513c-3p, hsa-miR-182-5p, and hsa-miR-548d-5p) and 6 genes (IGF1R, GSK3B, FOXO1, PRKAR2B, HIF1A, and PIK3R1) were the core nodes in the hypertension-related miRNA-gene network, and hsa-miR-548am-3p was at the center of the network. CONCLUSIONS These findings will help improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of hypertension, and the discovered genes can serve as signatures for early diagnosis of hypertension.","Li, Zongjin; Chyr, Jacqueline; Jia, Zeyu; Wang, Lina; Hu, Xi; Wu, Xiaoming; Song, Changxin",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,142,30

There are currently many approaches for its management, using both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The National Institute of Health - Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) score is a validated measure commonly used to measure CP/CPPS symptoms. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of non-pharmacological therapies for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). SEARCH METHODS We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases, trial registries, grey literature and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search of all databases was August 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were men with a diagnosis of CP/CPPS. We included all available non-pharmacological interventions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies, performed statistical analyses and rated quality of evidence (QoE) according to the GRADE methods. MAIN RESULTS We included 38 unique studies with 3290 men with CP/CPPS across 23 comparisons.1. Acupuncture: (three studies, 204 participants) based on short-term follow-up, acupuncture reduces prostatitis symptoms in an appreciable number of participants compared with sham procedure (mean difference (MD) in total NIH-CPSI score -5.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.32 to -4.26, high QoE). Acupuncture likely results in little to no difference in adverse events (moderate QoE). It probably also decreases prostatitis symptoms compared with standard medical therapy in an appreciable number of participants (MD -6.05, 95% CI -7.87 to -4.24, two studies, 78 participants, moderate QoE).2. Circumcision: (one study, 713 participants) based on short-term follow-up, early circumcision probably decreases prostatitis symptoms slightly (NIH-CPSI score MD -3.00, 95% CI -3.82 to -2.18, moderate QoE) and may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse events compared with control (a waiting list to be circumcised, low QoE).3. Electromagnetic chair: (two studies, 57 participants) based on short-term follow-up, we are uncertain of the effects of the use of an electromagnetic chair on prostatitis symptoms. It may be associated with a greater incidence of adverse events compared with sham procedure (low to very low QoE).4. Lifestyle modifications: (one study, 100 participants) based on short-term follow-up, lifestyle modifications may be associated with a greater improvement in prostatitis symptoms in an appreciable number of participants compared with control (risk ratio (RR) for improvement in NIH-CPSI scores 3.90, 95% CI 2.20 to 6.92, very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events.5. Physical activity: (one study, 85 participants) based on short-term follow-up, a physical activity programme may cause a small reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH-CPSI score MD -2.50, 95% CI -4.69 to -0.31, low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events.6. Prostatic massage: (two studies, 115 participants) based on short-term follow-up, we are uncertain whether the prostatic massage reduces or increases prostatitis symptoms compared with control (very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events.7. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy: (three studies, 157 participants) based on short-term follow-up, extracorporeal shockwave therapy reduces prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH-CPSI score MD -6.18, 95% CI -7.46 to -4.89, high QoE). These results may not be sustained at medium-term follow-up (low QoE). This treatment may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse events (low QoE).8. Transrectal thermotherapy compared to medical therapy: (two studies, 237 participants) based on short-term follow-up, transrectal thermotherapy alone or in combination with medical therapy may decrease prostatitis symptoms slightly when compared with medical therapy alone (NIH-CPSI score MD -2.50, 95% CI -3.82 to -1.18, low QoE). One included study reported that participants may experience transient adverse events.9. Other interventions: there is uncertainty about the effects of other interventions included in this review. We found no information regarding psychological support or prostatic surgery. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Some of the interventions can decrease prostatitis symptoms in an appreciable number without a greater incidence of adverse events. The QoE was mostly low. Future clinical trials should include a full report of their methods including adequate masking, consistent assessment of all patient-important outcomes including potential treatment-related adverse events and appropriate sample sizes.","Franco, Juan Va; Turk, Tarek; Jung, Jae Hung; Xiao, Yu-Tian; Iakhno, Stanislav; Garrote, Virginia; Vietto, Valeria",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,142,16

However, tack fixation poses the risk of adhesions and injury to the intestine. We report the case of spiral tacks adherent to the small bowel after IPOM repair for incisional hernia. PRESENTATION OF CASE 64 years old male patient who underwent laparoscopic IPOM repair for incisional hernia 1 year after open sigmoid resection. A laminated polypropylene mesh was fixed with titanium spiral tacks. 4 years later, elective open cholecystectomy was performed. Two spiral tacks integrated in the seromusular layer of the small bowel were encountered. Tacks were removed and bowel lesions oversewn with interrupted seromuscular stitches. DISCUSSION According to the current literature, complications related to metal spiral tacks in IPOM mesh repair such as intestinal perforation or strangulation ileus seem to be rare. To our knowledge, spiral tacks adherent to the intestine have not yet been published to date. Alternative techniques for mesh fixation are transfascial sutures with single stitches, continuous sutures or fibrin glue, as already used in TAPP and TEP procedures for inguinal hernia repair. The ideal and safest technique for mesh fixation in IPOM repair for incisional hernias remains controversial. CONCLUSION Spiral tacks used for intraperitoneal mesh fixation can lead to adhesions and bowel lesions. Sutures, absorbable tacks or fibrin glue are alternatives for mesh fixation. Further clinical trials are needed to evaluate the safest technique of laparoscopic IPOM incisional hernia repair.","Haltmeier, Tobias; Groebli, Yves",International journal of surgery case reports,142,26

METHODS A prospective, randomized comparison of laparoscopic skills performance on four access devices (ADs) (GelPOINT, SILS Port, SSL Access System, TriPort) and one IP-SSA setup was conducted. A laparoscopic trainer box was used to train 18 (2nd- to 4th-year) medical students, four surgical residents, and five attending surgeons to proficiency in multiport laparoscopy using four laparoscopic drills (i.e., peg transfer, bean drop, pattern cutting, extracorporeal suturing). Drills then were performed in random order on each IP-SSA and AD-SSA setup using straight laparoscopic instruments. Repetitions were timed and errors recorded. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey HSD post hoc tests. RESULTS The attending surgeons had significantly faster total task times than the residents or students (P < 0.001), but the difference between the residents and students was not significant. Pair-wise comparisons showed significantly faster total task times for the IP-SSA setup than for all four AD-SSAs within the student group only (P < 0.05). The total task times for the residents and attending surgeons showed a similar profile, but the differences were not significant. When the data for the three groups were combined, the total task time was less for the IP-SSA setup than for each of the four AD-SSA setups (P < 0.001). Similarly, the IP-SSA setup was significantly faster than three of the four AD-SSA setups for peg transfer, three of the four setups for pattern cutting, and two of the four setups for suturing. No significant differences in error rates between the IP-SSA and AD-SSA setups were detected. CONCLUSIONS Compared with an IP-SSA laparoscopic setup, AD-SSAs are associated with longer task performance times in a trainer box model, independently of the level of training. Task performance was similar across the different SSA devices.","Schill, Matthew R; Varela, J Esteban; Frisella, Margaret M; Brunt, L Michael",Surgical endoscopy,142,27

These effects are primarily induced by IL-1 cytokines, which are involved in the elevation of hepatic acute phase proteins and fever. IL-1 has a broad spectrum of biological activities and participates in both innate and acquired immunity. In infections, IL-1 induces gene expression and synthesis of several cytokines/chemokines in both macrophages and mast cells (MCs). The activation of MCs triggers the secretion of mediators stored in the granules, and the de novo synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In microorganism infections, the release of IL-1 macrophage acts on adhesion molecules and endothelial cells leading to hypotension and septic shock syndrome. IL-1 activated by SARS-CoV-2 stimulates the secretion of TNF, IL-6 and other cytokines, a pro-inflammatory complex that can lead to cytokine storm and be deleterious in both lung and systemically. In SARS-CoV-2 septic shock, severe metabolic cellular abnormalities occur which can lead to death. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 induces IL-1 in macrophages and MCs causing the induction of gene expression and activation of other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Since IL-1 is toxic, its production from ubiquitous MCs and macrophages activated by SARS-CoV-2 can also provokes both gastrointestinal and brain disorders. Furthermore, in these immune cells, IL-1 also elevates nitric oxide, and the release of inflammatory arachidonic acid products such as prostaglndins and thromboxane A2. All together these effects can generate cytokine storm and be the primary cause of severe inflammation with respiratory distress and death. Although, IL-1 administered in low doses may be protective; when it is produced in high doses in infectious diseases can be detrimental, Therefore, IL-1 blockade has been studied in many human diseases including sepsis, resulting that blocking it is absolutely necessary. This definitely nurtures hope for a new effective therapeutic treatment. Recently, two interesting anti-IL-1 cytokines have been widely described: IL-37 and IL-1Ra. IL-37, by blocking IL-1, has been observed to have anti-inflammatory action in rodents, in vivo and in transfected cells. It has been reported that IL-37 is a very powerful protein which inhibits inflammation and its inhibition can be a valid therapeutic strategy. IL-37 is a natural suppressor of inflammation that is generated through a caspase-1 that cleaves pro-IL-37 into mature IL-37 which translocates to the nucleus and inhibits the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes; while IL-1Ra inhibits inflammation by binding IL-1 to its IL-1R (receptor). We firmly believe that blocking IL-1 with an anti-inflammatory cytokine such as IL-37 and/or IL-1Ra is an effective valid therapy in a wide spectrum of inflammatory disorders including SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19. Here, we propose for the first time that IL-37, by blocking IL-1, may have an important role in the therapy of COVID-19.","Conti, P; Caraffa, Al; Gallenga, C E; Ross, R; Kritas, S K; Frydas, I; Younes, A; Ronconi, G",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,142,1

We present a patient with IVH secondary to a ruptured AVM safely treated with IVT rt-PA. A 48-year-old Hispanic male with a history of dermatomyositis presented to the emergency department with sudden left-sided weakness. En route to computed tomography (CT), he became lethargic. Computed tomography revealed extensive IVH with acute hydrocephalus, which was treated with the placement of external ventricular drain with clinical improvement. Computed tomography angiogram performed did not reveal AVM. Cerebral digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) was planned due to suspicion of AVM. Prior to DSA, patient became acutely lethargic. Computed tomography imaging revealed worsening hydrocephalus. External ventricular drain was noted to be draining. Repeat CT revealed improved hydrocephalus but with left lateral ventricle dilatation. Risks and benefits of IVT rt-PA were discussed with the family and a decision was made to treat.

With the sleeve gastrectomy growing to be the predominant primary bariatric operation in the United States, it is imperative that we understand the impact of LSG on GERD. OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of LSG on GERD symptoms. METHODS One hundred and ninety-one bariatric surgery candidates completed a Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL) questionnaire before and after undergoing elective LSG (mean follow-up time of 20.4 ± 2.7 months). Values were stratified by the presence or absence of preoperative GERD, GERD medications, age, gender, crural repair, patient satisfaction with present condition, and percent total weight loss (%TWL). RESULTS For the entire group, mean weight loss, %TWL, and reduction in BMI were 79 pounds, 28.1%, and 12.7 kg/m2 respectively. Within the overall cohort, there was no significant change in GERD symptoms from before to after surgery (mean GERD-HRQL scores were 6.1 before and after surgery, p = 0.981). However, in a subgroup analysis, patients without GERD preoperatively demonstrated a worsening in mean GERD-HRQL scores after surgery (from 2.4 to 4.5, p = 0.0020). The percentage of change in the usage of medications to treat GERD was not statistically significant (from 37 to 32%, p = 0.233). The percent of patients satisfied with their condition postoperatively was significantly increased in those with preoperative GERD, older age, crural repair intraoperatively, and in those with the highest %TWL. CONCLUSION These results suggest that while overall LSG does not significantly affect GERD symptoms, patients without GERD preoperatively may be at risk for developing new or worsening GERD symptoms after surgery. It is important to remark that this is a review of the patient's clinical symptoms of GERD, not related to any endoscopic, pathological, or manometry studies. Such studies are necessary to fully establish the effect of LSG on esophageal health.","Silveira, Flavia Carvalho; Poa-Li, Christina; Pergamo, Matthew; Gujral, Akash; Kolli, Sindhura; Fielding, George A; Ren-Fielding, Christine J; Schwack, Bradley F",Obesity surgery,142,1

We aimed to outline significant positive teaching outcomes and devise a comprehensive framework for the optimal teaching of suturing skills for medical students. MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched MEDLINE® (via Ovid), EMBASE and SCOPUS databases until July 2019 with no language restriction using predefined 'Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO)' criteria. Data were summarised in discrete thematic axes using a qualitative synthesis approach. RESULTS Our search yielded a total of 2,562 articles, out of which 25 were included in the final data synthesis. We provide a structured breakdown of educational interventions including participants, instructors and nature of teaching intervention. We also describe discrete means for assessment of performance and retention of suturing skills. Based on those we propose a standardised framework on teaching suturing skills for novices. CONCLUSION To our knowledge this is the first systematic review investigating teaching interventions used to teach suturing skills in medical students. After extraction of individual positive teaching outcomes and utilising widely known learning theories and principles, we devised a comprehensive framework for more efficient and cost-effective teaching of suturing skills to medical students in the future.","Emmanuel, Thanos; Nicolaides, Marios; Theodoulou, Iakovos; Yoong, Wai; Lymperopoulos, Nikolaos; Sideris, Michail",In vivo,142,33

Antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii were detected in ostriches from South and North America, Africa and Asia. Except for one study from Spain, there is a lack of information about T. gondii seroprevalence in ostriches from Europe. For this reason, the aim of the study was to detect antibodies to T. gondii in farm-reared ostriches from the Czech Republic. Serum samples of 409 ostriches (Struthio camelus), collected at 9 farms were tested by Latex agglutination test. Antibodies to T. gondii were detected in 149 (36%) birds with a statistical difference for individual farms (8%-71%, p = 0.0121), and regions (8%-65%, p = 0.002). Seropositivity did not statistically differ (p > 0.05) in size of farms (50% and 35% on small and large farms, respectively), sex of birds (38% and 35% in males and females, respectively), season and year of collection. Tissue samples (brain, heart, and pectoral muscle) of 105 birds were also tested by PCR to detect T. gondii DNA. The parasite T. gondii was detected in the brain and heart of one seronegative ostrich (1%) from a small farm. Based on our results, we can assume that ostriches may present high risk of toxoplasmosis for humans through consumption of raw or undercooked ostrich meat and even seronegative individuals could harbor T. gondii in their tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first serological detection of T. gondii in ostriches in the Czech Republic, and the first PCR detection in Europe.","Bártová, E; Kobédová, K; Budíková, M; Račka, K",International journal of food microbiology,142,1

We present a succinct overview of the topic, including the nature and magnitude of the problem, contributing factors, current limited options, and potential novel therapeutic approach. COMMENT Pre-, intra- and perioperative medications are commonly administered for anxiety, anaesthesia, muscle relaxation and pain relief among other reasons. Several of the medications alone or in joint-action can be additive or synergistic producing respiratory depression. Given the large number of surgical procedures that are performed each year, even a small percentage of postoperative respiratory complications translates into a large number of affected patients. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION Due to the large number of surgeries performed each year, and the variety of medications used before, during, and after surgery, the occurrence of postoperative respiratory depression is surprisingly common. It is a significant medical problem and burden on hospital resources. There is a need for new strategies to prevent and treat the acute and collateral problems associated with postoperative respiratory depression.","Peppin, John F; Pergolizzi, Joseph V; Gan, Tong J; Raffa, Robert B",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,142,1

The long-term results of a protocol using placement of multiple plastic stents to treat ABS following OLT were analyzed. METHODS All patients who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for OLT-related biliary complications at our Endoscopy Unit between July 1994 and March 2012 were retrospectively identified from the ERCP database. Patients with an ABS treated with an increasing number of plastic stents were included in the study. Follow-up after stent removal was obtained by telephone contact with the patient and/or referring physician and by liver function tests (LFTs) evaluation. RESULTS 56 patients, treated with an increasing number of plastic stents until resolution of the stricture, were included. Five patients were then excluded (unrelated death during treatment, n = 3; incomplete treatment because of poor compliance, n = 2), and 51/56 patients reached study end points and were included in the analysis. Resolution of ABS was obtained in 50/51 patients; 1 patient required hepaticojejunostomy because of failure to pass the stricture with the guidewire (per protocol resolution, 98 %). Mean duration of endoscopic treatment was 11.5 months, with a median 4 ERCPs per patient. Immediate ERCP-related adverse events occurred in 3/56 patients (5.4 %). After a median follow-up of 5.8 years from stent removal, 3/50 patients (6 %) had recurrence of ABS. These 3 patients were successfully treated again endoscopically and are asymptomatic after a further median follow-up of 5.6 years. CONCLUSIONS At long-term follow-up, endoscopic treatment with multiple plastic stents of ABS following OLT appeared to be effective in most patients. Stricture recurrence is rare and can be successfully treated again endoscopically.","Tringali, Andrea; Barbaro, Federico; Pizzicannella, Margherita; Boškoski, Ivo; Familiari, Pietro; Perri, Vincenzo; Gigante, Giovanni; Onder, Graziano; Hassan, Cesare; Lionetti, Raffaella; Ettorre, Giuseppe Maria; Costamagna, Guido",Endoscopy,142,31

Methods: The investigation about the psychological status of 183 medical staffs on duty during the epidemic period was conducted using Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) from 18th to 20th February, 2020, who came from Tianjin and other provinces. The respondents were divided into first-line and non-first-line groups according to their jobs, and local and non-local groups according to their work places, respectively. The data was collected by ""Star Questionnaires"" using the mobile terminal, and the statistical analysis was carried out to compare whether there were differences in depression and anxiety among medical staff of different groups. Results: The total SAS score (48.96±9.21) and SDS score (56.69±7.57) of all medical staff were higher than those of the national norm SAS (33.80±5.90) and SDS (41.88±10.57) from 1158 individuals (P<0.01) . Among 183 medical staff, the anxiety was found in 87 individuals and the rate of anxiety was 47.5%. The depression was found in 134 individuals and its rate was 73.2%. The anxiety combined with depression was found in 69 individuals and its rate was 37.7%. The scores of SAS and SDS of first-line group were (49.40±9.77) and (55.76±6.86) , respectively. And those of non-first-line group were (48.69±8.87) and (57.29±7.96) . They were higher than those of the national norm, and the differences were both statistically significant (P<0.01) , but there was no difference between the first-line group and non-first-line group.

Outlines of the torso in the frontal and anteroposterior planes were calculated from photographic images to determine continuous form gradients (m/m) for the anterior, posterior and lateral aspects of the torso. Torso cross-sectional areas at each vertical sample (0.001 m) were used to calculate maximal rate of change in cross-sectional area (m2/m) in the chest-waist and waist-hip segments. During the non-propulsive hand phase in middle-long distance front crawl, kicking propulsion is negligible and therefore the net force is equal to the drag. Drag coefficients were calculated at the instant of maximum horizontal deceleration of centre of mass during the non-propulsive hand phase of 400 m pace front crawl. Maximal rate of change in cross-sectional area (r = 0.44, p = 0.014) and posterior form gradient (r = 0.50, p = 0.006) of the waist-hip torso segment had moderate positive correlations with the maximal drag coefficient. A regression model including these variables explained 41% of the variance (p = 0.001).

We explored the active components against rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from an extensively used couplet of Chinese herbs, Gastrodia elata and Radix aconiti lateralis preparata (TF) via untargeted metabolomics and network pharmacological approaches. METHODS Water extracts of TF were mixed at ratios 1:1, 3:2 and 2:3 (w/w). Ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was then utilized as metabolomics screening. Human Metabolome (http://www.hmdb.ca/) and Lipidmaps (http://www.lipidmaps.org/) databases were used to annotate detected compounds. Further identification of vital genes and important pathways associated with the anti-RA properties of the TF preparations was done via network pharmacology, and verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS Four key compounds involved in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and isoflavonoid biosynthesis were identified through metabolomics analyses. Three key components of TF associated with anti-RA activity were linoleic acid, daidzein, and daidzin. Results of RT-qPCR revealed that all 3 tested TF couplets (1:1, 3:2, and 2:3) markedly suppressed the transcription of PTGS2. These results were consistent with our network pharmacological predictions.

We prospectively validated the usefulness of a predefined, structured, stepwise approach to DEN with the objective of improving procedural efficiency and resource use. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective study of patients with necrotizing pancreatitis who after endoscopic transluminal drainage did not have clinical improvement and required DEN. The study was undertaken in 2 phases. Phase I was a retrospective analysis of interventions performed using an unstructured, conventional approach. Median of 3 necrosectomy sessions (range, 2 to 3) were required to achieve 80% treatment success in 20 patients. On the basis of these observations, a structured approach that included 3 steps (debridement, necrosis extraction, and irrigation) was developed and validated prospectively in phase II in 39 patients. The main outcome was to compare procedural efficiency defined as a number of necrosectomy sessions to achieve treatment success. RESULTS Although there was no significant difference in treatment success (phase I=80.0 vs. phase II=94.9%, P=0.17), the procedure was more efficient in phase II [median session, 2 (interquartile range=1 to 3) vs. 3 (interquartile range=2 to 3); P=0.003]. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that a structured, stepwise approach was associated with fewer necrosectomy sessions to achieve treatment success (odds ratio=4.7; 95% confidence interval=1.5-15.0; P=0.008) when adjusted for patient demographics, lab parameters, and disease characteristics. CONCLUSIONS By decreasing the number of necrosectomy sessions, a structured, stepwise approach to endoscopic necrosectomy seems to improve procedural efficiency.","Bang, Ji Young; Wilcox, Charles Mel; Hawes, Robert; Varadarajulu, Shyam",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,142,5

Hemorrhagic infarction was more common in Q1 (P=0.037), and Q2 (P=0.018), compared with Q4, and parenchymal hemorrhage was more common in Q1 (P=0.029) than Q4. CONCLUSIONS Lower admission serum calcium level is independently associated with HT after IVT, and this hypothesis needs larger confirmatory trials.","Guo, Yang; Yan, Shenqiang; Zhang, Sheng; Zhang, Xiaocheng; Chen, Qingmeng; Liu, Keqin; Liebeskind, David S; Lou, Min",Stroke,142,1

This study investigated the clinical features of COVID-19 infection in solid-organ transplant recipients at our center in Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our study included 23 solidorgan transplant recipients and 336 nontransplant individuals (143 previously healthy and 193 patients with at least 1 comorbidity) who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 disease in our hospital between March 2020 and January 2021. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of patients were compared. We used SPSS version 20.0 for statistical analysis. All groups were compared using chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests. P < .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Mean age of solid-organ transplant recipients was 49.8 ± 13.7 years (78.3% men, 21.7% women). Among the 23 recipients, 17 (73.9%) were kidney and 6 (26.1%) were liver transplant recipients. Among nontransplant individuals, 88.7% (n = 298) had mild/moderate disease and 11.3% (n = 38) had severe disease. Among transplant recipients, 78.3% (n = 18) had mild/moderate disease and 21.7% (n = 5) had severe disease (P = .224). Transplant recipients had greater requirements for nasal oxygen (P = .005) and noninvasive mechanical ventilation (P = .003) and had longer length of intensive care unit stay (P = .030) than nontransplant individuals. No difference was found between the 2 groups in terms of mortality (P = .439). However, a subgroup analysis showed increased mortality in transplant recipients versus previously healthy patients with COVID-19 (P < .05). Secondary infections were major causes of mortality in transplant recipients. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 infection resulted in higher mortality in solid-organ transplant recipients versus that shown in healthy patients. More attention on secondary infections is needed in transplant recipients to reduce mortality.","Darılmaz Yüce, Gülbahar; Ulubay, Gaye; Tek, Korhan; Savaş Bozbaş, Şerife; Erol, Çiğdem; Büyükaşık, Pırıl; Haberal, Kemal Murat; Arslan, Ayşe Hande; Akçay, Müserref Şule; Haberal, Mehmet",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,142,31

The NV protease cleaves the polyprotein encoded by open reading frame 1 of the viral genome at five nonhomologous sites, releasing six nonstructural proteins that are essential for viral replication. The structural details of how NV protease recognizes multiple substrates are unclear. In our X-ray structure of an NV protease construct, we observed that the C-terminal tail, representing the native substrate positions P5 to P1, is inserted into the active site cleft of the neighboring protease molecule, providing atomic details of how NV protease recognizes a substrate. The crystallographic structure of NV protease with the C-terminal tail redesigned to mimic P4 to P1 of another substrate site provided further structural details on how the active site accommodates sequence variations in the substrates. Based on these structural analyses, substrate-based aldehyde inhibitors were synthesized and screened for inhibition potency. Crystallographic structures of the protease in complex with each of the three most potent inhibitors were determined. These structures showed concerted conformational changes in the S4 and S2 pockets of the protease to accommodate variations in the P4 and P2 residues of the substrate/inhibitor, which could be a mechanism for how the NV protease recognizes multiple sites in the polyprotein with differential affinities during virus replication. These structures further indicate that the mechanism of inhibition by these inhibitors involves covalent bond formation with the side chain of the conserved cysteine in the active site by nucleophilic addition, and such substrate-based aldehydes could be effective protease inhibitors.","Muhaxhiri, Zana; Deng, Lisheng; Shanker, Sreejesh; Sankaran, Banumathi; Estes, Mary K; Palzkill, Timothy; Song, Yongcheng; Prasad, B V Venkataram",Journal of virology,142,19

Although, the implicit costs of this pathology are increasing every year, thus, there is a need to find a novel method which can provide promising results in the management of diabetes and can overcome the side effects associated with the conventional medication. Comprehensive review of this topic was undertaken through various research and review papers which were conducted using MEDLINE, BIOSIS and EMBASE database.

From the detailed analysis, we have highlighted some molecular pathways and novel targets which had shown promising results in both in-vitro and in-vivo studies and may be considered as pipeline target for clinical trials. Furthermore, these targets not only abetted amelioration of diabetes but also helped in mitigation of diabetes associated complications as well. Thus, based on the available information and literature on these potential molecules, conclusive evidence can be drawn which confirms targeting these novel pathways may unleash an array of benefits that have the potential to overpower the benefits obtained from conventional therapy in the management of diabetes thereby decreasing morbidity and mortality associated with diabetic complications.","Gupta, Amit; Behl, Tapan; Sehgal, Aayush; Bhardwaj, Shaveta; Singh, Sukhbir; Sharma, Neelam; Hafeez, Abdul",Molecular biology reports,142,1

It results in job loss on the one hand and less wages, increased working hours, overqualified employees and part time jobs on the other hand. Low demand of labour and a huge availability of work force will put many in a disadvantageous position, where they will have to compromise with the circumstances by being underemployed. Cabinet decisions, by some Indian states like Uttar Pradesh, to suspend the labour laws related to minimum wage, bonus, working hours and other employee benefits will put workers in a highly disadvantageous position of being underemployed. This may lead to many socio-economic, psychological and health-related implications. OBJECTIVE The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review on the concept of underemployment, its types and consequences. METHODOLOGY A critical and constructive analysis of the literature was performed. RESULTS The findings reveal that if employment does not provide workers with proper opportunities to use their education, time, skills and expertise, it can create stressful situations in workers' lives.

In the case of enveloped viruses, this activity was assigned to the formation of a polyelectrolyte complex between an anionic species, the polyanion, and the spike cationic proteins which are, for polymer chemists, comparable to cationic polyelectrolytes. Unfortunately, in vitro antiviral activity was not confirmed in vivo, possibly because polyanions were captured by cationic blood elements before reaching target cells. Accordingly, virologists abandoned the use of polyanions for antiviral therapy. In the case of coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants the game may not be over because these viruses infect cells of airways and not of blood. This communication proposes strategies to use polysulfates to attack and inhibit viral particles before they reach target cells in the airways. For this, polysulfate solutions may be administered by spray, gargling and nebulization or used to capture virus-containing droplets and aerosols by bubbling when these vectors are in the atmosphere. The technical means exist. However, biocompatibility and biofunctionality tests are necessary in the case of airways. Such tests require manipulation of pathogens, something which is beyond the competences of a biomaterialist. For this, a specialist in virology is necessary. Attempts to find one failed so far despite all-around solicitations over the past ten months and despite the fact that attacking the virus with polysulfates may complement beneficially the defensive strategies based on masks, vaccines and hospitals.","Vert, Michel",Journal of biomaterials science.

To date, more than seventeen million confirmed cases and more than half a million died worldwide from COVID-19. Patients with cardiovascular disease are more susceptible to contracting this disease and presenting more complications. We did a literature search on the association of cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 in databases such as Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library. The purpose of this review is to provide updated information for health professionals who care for patients with COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease, given that they have a high risk of complications and mortality. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers is controversial, and there is no evidence not to use these medications in patients with COVID-19. Regarding treatment with hydroxychloroquine associated or not with azithromycin, there is evidence of a higher risk with its use than clinical benefit and decreased mortality. Likewise, patients with heart failure are an important risk group due to their condition per se. Patients with heart failure and COVID-19 are a diagnostic dilemma because the signs of acute heart failure could be masked.

METHODS Cross-sectional population-based cohort with randomized selection of participants from Linköping, Sweden. An Omron m10-IT oscillometric device was used for clinic and home blood pressures (HBP) in the morning and evening for 1 week. RESULTS We recruited 5029 middle-aged and mainly defined WCH as SBP at least 140 mmHg and/or DBP at least 90 mmHg with HBP less than 135/85 mmHg. There were 2680 normotensive participants and 648 had WCH after exclusion of treated participants. More women (59.5%) than men (42.8%, P < 0.001) had WCH. We found higher prevalence of CACS greater than 100 compared with less than 100 (12.4 vs. 7.2%, P < 0.001), PWV (11.5 ± 1.5 vs. 10.4 ± 1.3 m/s, P < 0.001) and a higher prevalence of one or more carotid plaques (59.5 vs. 48%, P < 0.001) in participants with WCH than in normotension. Participants with WCH also had more dyslipidemia and higher glucose levels. Normotensive women scored lower on nervousness than women with WCH (P = 0.022). After matching of 639 participants with WCH to normotensive participants according to age, gender and systolic HBP the prevalence of a high CACS (12.1 vs. 8.6%, P = 0.003,) PWV (11.0 ± 0.068 vs. 11.5 ± 0.068 m/s, estimated marginal means ± SE, P < 0.001 by ANOVA) but not more carotid plaques (59.5 vs. 55.6%, P = 0.23), remained in the participants with WCH compared with the matched normotensive participants. CONCLUSION WCH is particularly common in middle-aged women, and it displays metabolic dysfunction and increased prevalence of arteriosclerotic manifestations in both genders. As markers of increased cardiovascular risk were present also after matching normotensive and WCH participants according to systolic HBP, age and gender, the presence of WCH signals an increased cardiovascular risk burden that is not fully explained by elevated BP levels at home.","Johansson, Martina A K; Östgren, Carl Johan; Engvall, Jan; Swahn, Eva; Wijkman, Magnus; Nystrom, Fredrik H",Journal of hypertension,142,5

The proposed new DoA index is evaluated using data from adult patients in an age range from 22 to 75 years. The results show that the new DoA index is able to detect the changing pattern of EEG signals early and agree with the clinical notes of an attending anaesthetist.

ABSTRACT Natural pacing of the heart results in heart rate variability, an indicator of good health and cardiac function. A contributor to heart rate variability is respiratory sinus arrhythmia or RSA - an intrinsic respiratory modulated pacing of heart rate. The loss of RSA is associated with poor cardiac prognosis and sudden cardiac death. We tested if reinstatement of respiratory modulated heart rate (RMH) would improve cardiac performance in heart failure. Heart failure was induced in Wistar rats by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Rats were unpaced, monotonic paced and RMH paced; the latter had the same average heart rate as the monotonic paced animals. Cardiac function was assessed non-invasively using echocardiography before and after two weeks of daily pacing at a time when pacing was turned off. RMH increased cardiac output by 20 ± 8 % compared to monotonic pacing (-3 ± 5 %; P<0.05). This improvement in cardiac output was associated with an increase in stroke volume compared to monotonic pacing (P = 0.03) and improvement in circumferential strain (P = 0.02). Improvements in ejection fraction (P = 0.08) and surrogate measures of left ventricle compliance did not reach significance. Increases in contractility (P<0.05) and coronary blood flow (P<0.05) were seen in vitro during variable pacing to mimic RMH. Thus, in rats with left ventricular dysfunction, chronic RMH pacing improved cardiac function through improvements in systolic function. As these improvements were made with pacing switched off, we propose the novel idea that RMH pacing causes reverse-remodelling. This article is protected by copyright.

Traditional partner services metrics evaluate the number of partners found and treated. We estimated the proportion of partners of syphilis patients not locatable for intervention. METHODS We reviewed records of early syphilis cases (primary, secondary, early latent) reported during 2015-2017 in seven jurisdictions (Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia, New York City, and San Francisco). Among interviewed syphilis patients, we determined the proportion who reported named partners (with locating information), reported unnamed partners (no locating information), and did not report partners. For patients with no reported partners, we estimated their range of unreported partners to be between one and the average number of partners for patients who reported partners. RESULTS Among 29,719 syphilis patients, 23,613 (80%) were interviewed and 18,581 (63%) reported 84,224 sex partners (average=4.5; 20,853 (25%) named and 63,371 (75%) unnamed). An estimated 11,138 to 54,521 partners were unreported. Thus, 74,509 to 117,892 (of 95,362 to 138,745) partners were not reached by partner services (78-85%). Among interviewed patients, 71% reported ≥1 unnamed partner or reported no partners; this proportion was higher for men who reported sex with men [MSM] (75%), compared to men who reported sex with women only (65%), and women (44%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS The expression of eEF1A2 in ovarian cancer was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Using ovarian CCC cell lines, the antitumor effect of Plitidepsin was assessed both in vitro and in vivo. By over-expressing or knocking down the eEF1A2 expression, we investigated the role of eEF1A2 in the sensitivity of CCC cells to Plitidepsin. RESULTS Immunoreactivity to eEF1A2 was observed in 76.2% of CCC, which was significantly higher than other histological subtypes of ovarian cancer. Plitidepsin exhibited significant antitumor activity toward chemonaive and chemoresistant CCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Ectopic expression of eEF1A2 in CCC cells resulted in increased sensitivity to Plitidepsin. In contrast, eEF1A2 knockdown decreased sensitivity of CCC cells to plitidepsin. CONCLUSION Plitidepsin, a novel anti-cancer agent that targets eEF1A2, may be a promising agent for treating ovarian CCC.","Miyake, Ryuta; Yamanaka, Shoichiro; Matsubara, Sho; Mabuchi, Seiji",Anticancer research,142,19

The use of positron emission tomography (PET) would further increase the resolution and quantification accuracy of Affibody-based imaging. The rapid in vivo kinetics of Affibody molecules permit the use of the generator-produced radionuclide (68)Ga (T1/2=67.6 min). Earlier studies have demonstrated that the chemical nature of chelators has a substantial influence on the biodistribution properties of Affibody molecules. To determine an optimal labeling approach, the macrocyclic chelators 1,4,7,10-tetraazacylododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N,N,N-triacetic acid (NOTA) and 1-(1,3-carboxypropyl)-1,4,7- triazacyclononane-4,7-diacetic acid (NODAGA) were conjugated to the N-terminus of the synthetic Affibody molecule ZHER2:S1 targeting HER2. Affibody molecules were labeled with (68)Ga, and their binding specificity and cellular processing were evaluated. The biodistribution of (68)Ga-DOTA-ZHER2:S1, (68)Ga-NOTA-ZHER2:S1 and (68)Ga-NODAGA-ZHER2:S1, as well as that of their (111)In-labeled counterparts, was evaluated in BALB/C nu/nu mice bearing HER2-expressing SKOV3 xenografts. The tumor uptake for (68)Ga-DOTA-ZHER2:S1 (17.9 ± 0.7%IA/g) was significantly higher than for both (68)Ga-NODAGA-ZHER2:S1 (16.13 ± 0.67%IA/g) and (68)Ga-NOTA-ZHER2:S1 (13 ± 3%IA/g) at 2 h after injection. (68)Ga-NODAGA-ZHER2:S1 had the highest tumor-to-blood ratio (60 ± 10) in comparison with both (68)Ga-DOTA-ZHER2:S1 (28 ± 4) and (68)Ga-NOTA-ZHER2:S1 (42 ± 11). The tumor-to-liver ratio was also higher for (68)Ga-NODAGA-ZHER2:S1 (7 ± 2) than the DOTA and NOTA conjugates (5.5 ± 0.6 vs.3.3 ± 0.6). The influence of chelator on the biodistribution and targeting properties was less pronounced for (68)Ga than for (111)In. The results of this study demonstrate that macrocyclic chelators conjugated to the N-terminus have a substantial influence on the biodistribution of HER2-targeting Affibody molecules labeled with (68)Ga.This can be utilized to enhance the imaging contrast of PET imaging using Affibody molecules and improve the sensitivity of molecular imaging. The study demonstrated an appreciable difference of chelator influence for (68)Ga and (111)In.","Strand, Joanna; Honarvar, Hadis; Perols, Anna; Orlova, Anna; Selvaraju, Ram Kumar; Karlström, Amelie Eriksson; Tolmachev, Vladimir",PloS one,142,16
75704,75704,75704,ART and science of keeping HIV out of the blood supply.,13.706765,7.732703,2020-09-10,"BACKGROUND The majority of transplant recipients undergo immunosuppressive treatment to prevent organ or tissue rejection. Consequently, they are more susceptible to infection agents including a number of viruses causing a significant morbidity and mortality. Only a limited number of viruses are currently tested for in transplant donors and recipients due to the cost and complexity. TLDA may provide a suitable format to address more systematic testing approach. METHODS 101 liver transplant recipient samples were retrospectively tested for 48 viral targets including two controls (BVDV and MS2) and two common viruses (TTV and HPgV), using a custom designed TLDA. 8 samples were analysed simultaneously on 384-well TLDA. Samples giving a signal considered positive/indeterminant were re-tested by different individual confirmatory assays. RESULTS Infections with six previously untested for viruses - EBV, HPIV3, HuPuV9, KIV, HMPV and HPV - were detected in fourteen patients. Previously detected HCV infections were also confirmed. These infections did not seem have an effect on 5 year post-transplant outcome. 55 of 79 and 17 of 87 samples available for confirmatory assays were positive for TTV and HPgV, included for the evaluation of the TLDA performance. CONCLUSIONS The custom viral TLDA can be successfully used for simultaneous detection of a range of post-transplant viral infections. To fully exploit its potential for monitoring and intervention, a whole blood testing should be applied in a prospective setting.","Cleland, Alexander; Malloy, Kristen; Donnelly, Mhairi C; Davidson, Janice; Simpson, Kenneth J; Petrik, Juraj",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,142,2

A constantly search for market leadership, including Dentistry field and dental materials, stimulates the industries to launch daily new products. Inventions related to health researches are mostly protected by patents as intellectual property. A patent landscape analysis through searches in patent banks is a tool used to identify trends in different areas of innovations. OBJECTIVE Identify and evaluate the scenario of research, development and innovation of dental products in Argentina by a technological prospecting based on patents. METHODS A survey of patent documents was conducted by searching for deposited and granted patents of dental products. The searches were carried out during January 2020 in the patent database of the National Institute of Industrial Property of Argentina (INPI-AR). The terms 'dentistry', ""buccal"", 'dental' and ""oral"" were used to select in the titles and abstracts of patent application reports. The information extracted from patent reports was organized in tables and graphs using GraphPad Prism 6 software to evaluate the applications. RESULTS A total of 363 patents were published from 1989 to 2016, mainly by international industries, 93.3 % as Patent Invention and 3.0 % as a Utility Model applications on Dentistry. Only two patents (0.5 %) were deposited by universities, as University of Melbourne (Patent number 20060102378) and Universidad Nacional del Nordeste (Patent number 20140104149) which only the last one is national. Among the deposits only 6.6 % were granted, the most was in force, denied or lost. According to the specialties, most patents were related to compositions (64.7 %) and personal products (21.7 %), also on Dentistry/Cariology (6.33 %) and Prostheses/Implants (4.68 %). CONCLUSION In general, we find that the most patent applications are related to the preventive area, personal products and compositions for formulations. Few dental patents deposits are currently available in Argentina, suggesting that the importation of products into the area remains large, which can make dental products more expensive. It is important to invest in technology-based companies to promote increased economic activity, being a consequence of investment in knowledge creation and intellectual property to the Dentistry area.","Marques, Lidia Audrey Rocha Valadas; de Oliveira Filho, Rosueti Diógenes; Lotif, Mara Assef Leitão; Girão, Francisco Josimar; de Alencar, Emmanuel Arraes; Bandeira, Mary Anne Medeiros; Squassi, Aldo",Recent patents on biotechnology,142,5

METHODS We examined the incidence of clinical complications and physiological derangements that occurred in 160 neurologically injured patients (90 males, 70 females, mean age 57 ± 17 years) who underwent intra-hospital transport (288 cases, 237 scheduled, 51 unscheduled) for computed tomography scans. RESULTS Our findings indicate that (1) at least one significant complication (predominantly hemodynamic) occurred in over one-third (36%) of all transports (p = n.s scheduled vs. unscheduled) necessitating the deployment of interventions designed to treat changes in arterial pressure (2) despite the presence of trained medical personnel and availability of specialized equipment, intra-cranial pressure was not adequately monitored during transports (especially in patients with intra-cranial hypertension prior to transport) (3) intra-hospital transfer was associated with minor but statistically significant clinical changes, including a reduction in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (Pa(O(2)))/inspired oxygen fraction (Fi(O(2))) (only in the scheduled transport population), decreased arterial lactate levels (scheduled transport population), lowered body temperature (scheduled transport population), and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pa(CO(2))) (scheduled transport population). CONCLUSIONS Intra-hospital transport of brain-injured NICU patients may present some hazards even if performed by skilled personnel with specialized equipment. In Trauma Centers such as ours, an improvement in the frequency of neuromonitoring [intra-cranial pressure (ICP) and end-tidal CO2 (ET(CO(2)))] during transport is recommended.","Picetti, Edoardo; Antonini, Marta Velia; Lucchetti, Maria Chiara; Pucciarelli, Serena; Valente, Adriana; Rossi, Ilaria; Schiavi, Paolo; Servadei, Franco; Caspani, Maria Luisa; Mergoni, Mario",Neurocritical care,142,16

OBJECTIVES To compare respiratory physiology, clinical outcomes, and extrapulmonary clinical features of severe COVID-19 with non-COVID ARDS. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study, comparing 130 consecutive mechanically ventilated patients with severe COVID-19 with 382 consecutive mechanically ventilated patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS. Initial respiratory physiology and 28-day outcomes were compared. Extrapulmonary manifestations (inflammation, extrapulmonary organ injury, and coagulation) were compared in an exploratory analysis. RESULTS Comparison of patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS suggested small differences in respiratory compliance, ventilatory efficiency, and oxygenation. 28-day mortality was 30% in COVID-19 patients and 38% in non-COVID ARDS. In adjusted analysis, point estimates of differences in time-to-breathing-unassisted at 28 days (adjusted SHR 0.98 [95% CI 0.77-1.26]) and 28-day mortality (risk ratio = 1.01 [95% CI 0.72-1.42]) were small for COVID-19 vs. non-COVID ARDS, although the confidence intervals for these estimates include moderate differences. Patients with COVID-19 had lower neutrophil counts but did not differ in lymphocyte count or other measures of systemic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS In this single center cohort, we found no evidence for large differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID ARDS. Many key clinical features of severe COVID-19 were similar to those of non-COVID-19 ARDS, including respiratory physiology and clinical outcomes, although our sample size precludes definitive conclusions. Further studies are needed to define COVID-19-specific pathophysiology before deviation from evidence-based treatment practices can be recommended.","Sjoding, Michael W; Admon, Andrew J; Saha, Anjan K; Kay, Stephen G; Brown, Christopher A; Co, Ivan; Claar, Dru; McSparron, Jakob I; Dickson, Robert P",Annals of the American Thoracic Society,142,32

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is used to diagnose a current infection, but its utility as a reference standard is constrained by sampling errors, limited sensitivity (71% to 98%), and dependence on the timing of specimen collection. Chest imaging tests are being used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease, or when RT-PCR testing is unavailable. OBJECTIVES To determine the diagnostic accuracy of chest imaging (computed tomography (CT), X-ray and ultrasound) in people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS We searched the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. We conducted searches for this review iteration up to 5 May 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA We included studies of all designs that produce estimates of test accuracy or provide data from which estimates can be computed. We included two types of cross-sectional designs: a) where all patients suspected of the target condition enter the study through the same route and b) where it is not clear up front who has and who does not have the target condition, or where the patients with the target condition are recruited in a different way or from a different population from the patients without the target condition. When studies used a variety of reference standards, we included all of them. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We screened studies and extracted data independently, in duplicate. We also assessed the risk of bias and applicability concerns independently, in duplicate, using the QUADAS-2 checklist and presented the results of estimated sensitivity and specificity, using paired forest plots, and summarised in tables. We used a hierarchical meta-analysis model where appropriate. We presented uncertainty of the accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS We included 84 studies, falling into two categories: studies with participants with confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 at the time of recruitment (71 studies with 6331 participants) and studies with participants suspected of COVID-19 (13 studies with 1948 participants, including three case-control studies with 549 cases and controls). Chest CT was evaluated in 78 studies (8105 participants), chest X-ray in nine studies (682 COVID-19 cases), and chest ultrasound in two studies (32 COVID-19 cases). All evaluations of chest X-ray and ultrasound were conducted in studies with confirmed diagnoses only. Twenty-five per cent (21/84) of all studies were available only as preprints, 15/71 studies in the confirmed cases group and 6/13 of the studies in the suspected group. Among 71 studies that included confirmed cases, 41 studies had included symptomatic cases only, 25 studies had included cases regardless of their symptoms, five studies had included asymptomatic cases only, three of which included a combination of confirmed and suspected cases. Seventy studies were conducted in Asia, 2 in Europe, 2 in North America and one in South America. Fifty-one studies included inpatients while the remaining 24 studies were conducted in mixed or unclear settings. Risk of bias was high in most studies, mainly due to concerns about selection of participants and applicability. Among the 13 studies that included suspected cases, nine studies were conducted in Asia, and one in Europe. Seven studies included inpatients while the remaining three studies were conducted in mixed or unclear settings. In studies that included confirmed cases the pooled sensitivity of chest CT was 93.1% (95%CI: 90.2 - 95.0 (65 studies, 5759 cases); and for X-ray 82.1% (95%CI: 62.5 to 92.7 (9 studies, 682 cases). Heterogeneity judged by visual assessment of the ROC plots was considerable. Two studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound and both reported zero false negatives (with 10 and 22 participants having undergone ultrasound, respectively). These studies only reported True Positive and False Negative data, therefore it was not possible to pool and derive estimates of specificity. In studies that included suspected cases, the pooled sensitivity of CT was 86.2% (95%CI: 71.9 to 93.8 (13 studies, 2346 participants) and specificity was 18.1% (95%CI: 3.71 to 55.8). Heterogeneity judged by visual assessment of the forest plots was high. Chest CT may give approximately the same proportion of positive results for patients with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection: the chances of getting a positive CT result are 86% (95% CI: 72 to 94) in patient with a SARS-CoV-2 infection and 82% (95% CI: 44 to 96) in patients without. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The uncertainty resulting from the poor study quality and the heterogeneity of included studies limit our ability to confidently draw conclusions based on our results. Our findings indicate that chest CT is sensitive but not specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected patients, meaning that CT may not be capable of differentiating SARS-CoV-2 infection from other causes of respiratory illness. This low specificity could also be the result of the poor sensitivity of the reference standard (RT-PCR), as CT could potentially be more sensitive than RT-PCR in some cases. Because of limited data, accuracy estimates of chest X-ray and ultrasound of the lungs for the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be carefully interpreted. Future diagnostic accuracy studies should avoid cases-only studies and pre-define positive imaging findings. Planned updates of this review will aim to: increase precision around the accuracy estimates for CT (ideally with low risk of bias studies); obtain further data to inform accuracy of chest X rays and ultrasound; and continue to search for studies that fulfil secondary objectives to inform the utility of imaging along different diagnostic pathways.","Salameh, Jean-Paul; Leeflang, Mariska Mg; Hooft, Lotty; Islam, Nayaar; McGrath, Trevor A; van der Pol, Christian B; Frank, Robert A; Prager, Ross; Hare, Samanjit S; Dennie, Carole; Spijker, René; Deeks, Jonathan J; Dinnes, Jacqueline; Jenniskens, Kevin; Korevaar, Daniël A; Cohen, Jérémie F; Van den Bruel, Ann; Takwoingi, Yemisi; van de Wijgert, Janneke; Damen, Johanna Aag; Wang, Junfeng; McInnes, Matthew Df",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,142,25

Methods: Literature on novel coronavirus pneumonia was retrieved from PubMed and EMBASE databases. The relevant data was extracted and a meta-analysis was performed using StatsDirect statistical software V.2.8.0 to calculate the combined odds ratio. Results: Seven studies were included, consisting of 1594 cases. The meta-analysis result showed that the most common clinical symptoms of the novel coronavirus pneumonia were fever (91.6%) and cough (64.5%), followed by dyspnea (32.8%) and sputum (28.1%). Headache (10.5%), sore throat (11.2%), hemoptysis (3.2%), diarrhea (6.6%) and the other symptoms were relatively rare. Aspartate aminotransferase (29%), alanine transaminase (22.7%), and total bilirubin (11.7%) levels were elevated, except for serum albumin levels (80.4%). The common therapeutic agents used were antibiotics (87.7%), antiviral drugs (75.5%), and glucocorticoids (26.6%), while antifungal agents (7.7%) were used in few. Mechanical ventilation (13.4%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (1.9%), and continuous renal replacement therapy (3.8%) were used in severe cases. The rate of mortality in hospital was 7.7%, respectively. Heterogeneity between studies was significant; however, subgroup and sensitivity analysis had failed to identify clear sources of heterogeneity. Conclusion: Fever, cough and liver dysfunction are the main clinical manifestations of this disease and the mortality rate is low.","Wu, Y Y; Li, H Y; Xu, X B; Zheng, K X; Qi, X S; Guo, X Z",Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,142,1

One major cause for failure of NPC chemotherapeutic treatments is reportedly correlated with the elevation of cancer stem cell (CSC) fractions. Thus, this present study aims to investigate the effect of cisplatin (CDDP) treatment on the enrichment of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and its associated signaling pathway in EBV-negative NPC cells. Cisplatin-pretreated 5-8F NPC cells (5-8F CDDP) were first generated by treating the cells with 0.5 μM cisplatin for 48 h. After the instant treatment, 5-8F CDDP showed increased IC50 values, demonstrating a decrease in CDDP sensitization. Besides, the proportion of NPC cells with cancer stem-like phenotypes comprising side population (SP), key stemness-related gene expressions including SOX2, ALDH1, CD24 was significantly enhanced. Additionally, 5-8F CDDP displayed the upregulation of β-catenin gene, suggesting its association with the CSC-initiating mechanism. Furthermore, a tankyrase inhibitor for Wnt/β-catenin pathway, XAV939, substantially reduced CSCs and retrieved the cisplatin sensitivity in 5-8F CDDP. This confirms that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling is accountable for rising of the CSC population in EBV-negative NPC. Finally, the combined treatment of CDDP and XAV939 exhibited lower 5-8F CDDP cell viability compared to the treatment of CDDP alone, suggesting the reversal of cisplatin sensitization. In conclusion, the enhancement of CSCs in 5-8F NPC cells caused by the instant cisplatin treatment is initially mediated through the upregulation of β-catenin and activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. As a result, a primary chemotherapeutic treatment with closely monitoring the targeted Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway could potentially prevent the development of CSCs and improve the treatment efficiency in NPC.","Sinnung, Sirorut; Janvilisri, Tavan; Kiatwuthinon, Pichamon",Molecular and cellular biochemistry,142,17

Secondary goals included the assessment of anatomical correction, recurrence and complication rates. METHODS This is a prospective, single-center study that included 82 patients between 2009 and 2016. A clinical evaluation took place before surgery, and was repeated at 3, 12, 36 and 60 months postoperatively. Patients routinely received an anterior prosthesis, associated with a posterior prosthesis in case of symptomatic rectocele. Patients included self-administered questionnaires for functional pelvic problems (PFDI-20), quality of life (PFIQ-7), and sexual function (PISQ-12), and a clinical examination with POP-Q staging, at each medical visit. RESULTS Functional pelvic problems derived from prolapse (PFDI-20 scores) and their impact on patients' quality of life (PFIQ-7 score) significantly improved at 3, 12, 36 and 60 months postoperatively. Improvement on sexual activity was significant at 3 and 60 months postoperatively. Effective prolapse anatomical correction (POP-Q score < 2) was found in 94.4% and 97.2% of patients at the anterior and middle stages, respectively, at the end of follow-up, but only in 80.3% at the posterior stage. Symptomatic recurrence required surgical intervention in 4 patients (5.3%). CONCLUSIONS This long-term follow-up prospective analysis confirms the good functional and anatomical results of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy for pelvic organ prolapse.","Wagner, Laurent; Chevrot, Armand; Llinares, Elisabeth; Costa, Pierre; Droupy, Stéphane",International urology and nephrology,142,6

This was a descriptive study of the preparedness planning, infection prevention, and collaboration with public health agencies undertaken by 2 health systems in Wisconsin between September and December 2014. The preparedness approach used by the 2 health systems relied successfully on their robust infrastructure for planning and infection prevention. In the setting of rapidly evolving guidance and unprecedented fear regarding Ebola, the 2 health systems enhanced their response through collaboration and coordination with each other and government public health agencies. Key lessons learned included the importance of a rigorous planning process, robust infection prevention practices, and coalitions between public and private health sectors. The potential threat of Ebola virus disease stimulated emergency preparedness in which acute care facilities played a leading role in the public health response.

The purpose of this study was to develop soluble prodrugs of celecoxib with reduced pigment binding and enhanced retinal delivery. Three hydrophilic amide prodrugs of celecoxib, celecoxib succinamidic acid (CSA), celecoxib maleamidic acid (CMA), and celecoxib acetamide (CAA) were synthesized and characterized for solubility and lipophilicity. In vitro melanin binding to natural melanin (Sepia officinalis) was estimated for all three prodrugs. In vitro transport studies across isolated bovine sclera and sclera-choroid-RPE (SCRPE) were performed. Prodrug with the highest permeability across SCRPE was characterized for metabolism and cytotoxicity and its in vivo transscleral delivery in pigmented rats. Aqueous solubilities of CSA, CMA, and CAA were 300-, 182-, and 76-fold higher, respectively, than celecoxib. Melanin binding affinity and capacity were significantly lower than for celecoxib for all three prodrugs. Rank order for the % in vitro transport across bovine sclera and SCRPE was CSA > CMA ~ CAA ~ celecoxib, with the transport being 8-fold higher for CSA than celecoxib. CSA was further assessed for its metabolic stability and in vivo delivery. CSA showed optimum metabolic stability in all eye tissues with only 10-20% conversion to parent celecoxib in 30 min. Metabolic enzymes responsible for bioconversion included amidases, esterase, and cytochrome P-450. In vivo delivery in pigmented BN rats showed that CSA had 4.7-, 1.4-, 3.3-, 6.0-, and 4.5-fold higher delivery to sclera, choroid-RPE, retina, vitreous, and lens than celecoxib. CSA has no cytotoxicity in ARPE-19 cells in the concentration range of 0.1 to 1000 μM. Celecoxib succinamidic acid, a soluble prodrug of celecoxib with reduced melanin binding, enhances transscleral retinal delivery of celecoxib.","Malik, Pradip; Kadam, Rajendra S; Cheruvu, Narayan P S; Kompella, Uday B",Molecular pharmaceutics,142,16

This paper describes the preparation and activity of these military teams, records the lessons identified (LI) and reviews the complications encountered'. The teams each had two members. A consultant or registrar in emergency medicine (EM) and pre-hospitalemergency medicine (PHEM)E or anaesthesia and an emergency nurse or paramedic. Following a period of training, the teams undertook 52 transfers over a 14-day period. LI centred around minimising both interruption to ventilation and risk of aerosolisation of infectious particles and thus the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to the treating clinicians. Three patient-related complications (6% of all transfers) were identified. This was the first occasion on which the Defence Medical Services (DMS) were the main focus of a large-scale clinical military aid to the civil authorities. It demonstrated that DMS personnel have the flexibility to deliver a novel effect and the ability to seamlessly and rapidly integrate with a civilian organisation. It highlighted some clinical lessons that may be useful for future prehospital emergency care taskings where patients may have a transmissible respiratory pathogen. It also showed that clinicians from different backgrounds are able to safely undertake secondary transfer of ventilated patients.

However, it is critical to develop suitable in vitro platforms to isolate and characterize the replication kinetics and pathogenesis of recently identified human pathogens. HCoV-HKU1, a human coronavirus identified in a clinical sample from a patient with severe pneumonia, has been a major challenge for successful propagation on all immortalized cells tested to date. To determine if HCoV-HKU1 could replicate in in vitro models of human ciliated airway epithelial cell cultures (HAE) that recapitulate the morphology, biochemistry, and physiology of the human airway epithelium, the apical surfaces of HAE were inoculated with a clinical sample of HCoV-HKU1 (Cean1 strain). High virus yields were found for several days postinoculation and electron micrograph, Northern blot, and immunofluorescence data confirmed that HCoV-HKU1 replicated efficiently within ciliated cells, demonstrating that this cell type is infected by all human coronaviruses identified to date. Antiserum directed against human leukocyte antigen C (HLA-C) failed to attenuate HCoV-HKU1 infection and replication in HAE, suggesting that HLA-C is not required for HCoV-HKU1 infection of the human ciliated airway epithelium. We propose that the HAE model provides a ready platform for molecular studies and characterization of HCoV-HKU1 and in general serves as a robust technology for the recovery, amplification, adaptation, and characterization of novel coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses from clinical material.","Pyrc, Krzysztof; Sims, Amy C; Dijkman, Ronald; Jebbink, Maarten; Long, Casey; Deming, Damon; Donaldson, Eric; Vabret, Astrid; Baric, Ralph; van der Hoek, Lia; Pickles, Raymond",Journal of virology,142,5

The most common symptoms of COVID‑19 are: fever (81.8%-100%), cough (46.3%-86.2%), myalgia and fatigue (11%-50%), expectoration (4.4%-72%), and dyspnea (18.6%-59%). The most common laboratory abnormalities in COVID‑19 include decreased lymphocyte count (35%-82.1%), thrombocytopenia (17%-36.2%), elevated serum C‑reactive protein (60.7%-93%), lactate dehydrogenase (41%-76%), and D‑dimer concentrations (36%-46.4%). Among comorbidities in patients with COVID‑19, cardiovascular disease is most commonly found. In addition, patients with concomitant cardiovascular diseases have worse prognosis and more often require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), compared with patients without such comorbidities. It is estimated that about 20% of patients with COVID‑19 develop cardiac injury. Cardiac injury is more prevalent among patients with COVID‑19 who require ICU care. In a group of critically ill patients, 27.5% had an elevated N‑terminal pro-B‑type natriuretic peptide concentration, and increased cardiac troponin level was found in 10% of patients. One of the life‑threatening cardiac manifestations is coronavirus fulminant myocarditis, which may also occur without accompanying symptoms of pulmonary involvement. Early recognition and treatment is crucial in these cases. So far, data on the incidence of arrhythmias in patients with COVID‑19 are limited.

Two-piece extended catheters permit remote exit-site locations away from problematic abdominal conditions. OBJECTIVE The effect on clinical outcomes by remotely locating catheter exit sites to the upper abdomen or chest was compared to conventional lower abdominal sites. METHODS In a nonrandomized design, peritoneal access was established with 158 extended catheters and 270 conventional catheters based upon body habitus and special clinical needs. Prospective data collection included patient demographics, infectious and mechanical complications, and catheter survival. RESULTS Kaplan-Meier survival time until first exit-site infection was longer for extended catheters (p = 0.03). Poisson regression showed no difference in exit site, subcutaneous tunnel, and peritonitis infection rates; however, the proportion of catheters lost during peritonitis episodes was significantly greater for extended catheters (p = 0.007) and appeared to be due primarily to coagulase-negative staphylococcus organisms. Poisson regression showed interactions of body mass index (BMI) and diabetic status in determining catheter loss from peritonitis for both catheter types (p = 0.02). Extended catheter patients had higher BMI and diabetes prevalence (p < 0.0001). Overall extended catheter survival at 1, 2, and 3 years (92%, 80%, 71%) trended lower than conventional devices (93%, 87%, 80%; p = 0.0505).

However, a universally effective treatment regimen has not been developed to date. The main protease (Mpro), a key enzyme of SARS-CoV-2, plays a crucial role in the replication and transcription of this virus in cells and has become the ideal target for rational antiviral drug design. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations three times for these complexes of Mpro (monomeric and dimeric) and nine potential drugs that have a certain effect on the treatment of COVID-19 to explore their binding mechanism. In addition, a total of 12 methods for calculating binding free energy were employed to determine the optimal drug. Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Chloroquine consistently showed an outstanding binding ability to monomeric Mpro under various methods. Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Saquinavir presented the best performance when binding to a dimer, which was independent of the protonated state of Hie41 (protonated at Nε) and Hid41 (protonated at Nδ), and these findings suggest that Chloroquine may not effectively inhibit the activity of dimeric Mpro in vivo. Furthermore, three common hot-spot residues of Met165, Hie41, and Gln189 of monomeric Mpro systems dominated the binding of Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Chloroquine. In dimeric Mpro, Gln189, Met165, and Met49 contributed significantly to binding with Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Saquinavir; therefore, Gln189 and Met165 might serve as the focus in the discovery and development of anti-COVID-19 drugs. In addition, the van der Waals interaction played a significant role in the binding process, and the benzene ring of the drugs showed an apparent inhibitory effect on the normal function of Mpro. The binding cavity had great flexibility to accommodate these different drugs. The results would be notably helpful for enabling a detailed understanding of the binding mechanisms for these important drug-Mpro interactions and provide valuable guidance for the design of potent inhibitors.","Luo, Song; Huang, Kaifang; Zhao, Xiaoyu; Cong, Yalong; Zhang, John Z H; Duan, Lili",Nanoscale,142,1

Methods A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted from December 2017 to January 2019. The trial included 60 subjects between the ages of 19 and 70 who had higher alanine transaminase (ALT) levels than the normal upper limit. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: GS-KG9 (n = 30) and placebo (n = 30). The former was administered three GS-KG9 capsules (3 g/day) and the latter three placebo capsules (3 g/day) twice each day orally after meals in the morning and evening for 12 weeks. The primary goal was to observe the changes in ALT and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels. The safety of the treatment was assessed and adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Results Out of 60 subjects, nine were excluded from the efficacy analysis because they met the exclusion criteria. Therefore, a total of 51 subjects were evaluated for the effectiveness of the treatment (26 in the GS-KG9 group and 25 in the placebo group). After 12 weeks of treatment, the ALT levels were significantly reduced in the GS-KG9 group compared to the placebo group (p=0.009). The GGT level of the GS-KG9 group was significantly lower than that of the placebo group (p=0.036). Mild AEs, such as diarrhea, occurred during the study. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Conclusion The results of this trial suggest that GS-KG9 might be an effective and safe option for mild hepatic dysfunction.

In this work we attempt to review the current literature and to investigate the possible combination of LESS to other currently available approaches such as natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), needlescopic and robotic laparoscopic surgery. METHODS Extensive literature search on the topics of LESS, hybrid and pure NOTES, Needlescopic-assisted LESS and ""Robot-assisted LESS"" took place. Additionally, the accumulated experience from 118 LESSs performed in our departments is presented in an attempt to provide evidence regarding the mix of technique in LESS in urology. RESULTS The challenging nature of LESS limits the broader application and acceptance. Expanding experience in single-site surgery has currently provided tools such as transvaginal access, needlescopic instruments and robot assistance that can aid LESS and enhance its efficiency without compromising any of its advantages. A mix of these techniques with LESS could ease the stiff learning curve of the second and benefit not only its performance but also the adaptation of LESS as a standard practice. CONCLUSION Pure LESS although feasible, remains a technical challenge for the surgeon, preventing the widespread application of the technique. The goal of urologists on LESS surgery should not be the purity of LESS approach, but the superiority against already established techniques. A mix of techniques could be a key for the documentation of the advantages of LESS over conventional laparoscopy.","Liatsikos, Evangelos; Kyriazis, Iason; Kallidonis, Panagiotis; Do, Minh; Dietel, Anja; Stolzenburg, Jens-Uwe",World journal of urology,142,24

METHODS We carried out a cross-sectional study in December 2020 and enrolled 800 elderly people through stratified sampling technique, including 777 valid samples (with a mean age of 71.81 ± 8.36 years), of which 382 cases (49.2%) were women. The level of healthy fitness was measured using the HFMS V1.0. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient, split-half reliability, test-retest reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, exploratory factor and confirmatory factor were calculated for assessing the reliability and validity of HFMS V1.0. RESULTS HFMS V1.0 consists of 8 dimensions and 38 items. The scale had acceptable reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.920, split-half = 0.946, test-retest = 0.878). Exploratory factor analysis showed KMO value =0.927, and uncovered 10 factors with the cumulative contribution rate of 65.71% and all factor loads over 0.40. The item distribution was consistent with the initial expectation of the scale. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated good fit: CMIN/DF = 2.796, RMSEA = 0.048, IFI =0.914, TLI = 0.902, CFI = 0.913. CONCLUSION HFMS V1.0 was shown to have acceptable reliability and validity indices for this sample. Collectively, HFMS V1.0 is reliable and efficient to measure the healthy fitness of elderly people. It is recommended to use it among the elderly in other Chinese cities in the future to ensure uniformity and objectivity. This scale can be carried out to evaluate of the effectiveness of public health measures in improving the healthy fitness level of the elderly and optimizing public health policies.","Liu, Qian; Zhou, Hui; Qiu, Heng; Huang, Chen; Jiang, Lijie; Jiang, Guli; Wu, Weixuan; Huang, Zhuomin; Xu, Jun",BMC public health,142,17

Catheter pinch-off syndrome is a rare and unusual complication. It is difficult to retrieve dislodged catheters from the pulmonary artery, especially if the catheter is stuck to the peripheral pulmonary artery. We herein describe the successful removal of a catheter stuck in the pulmonary artery with a stepwise approach. First, a pigtail catheter was used to tug the dislodged catheter in order to free the unilateral end. Then, a gooseneck snare was used to catch and pull the catheter out of the patient. The key to success is to free the end of the catheter.","Nakabayashi, Keisuke; Nomura, Hidekimi; Isomura, Daichi; Sugiura, Ryo; Oka, Toshiaki",Case reports in cardiology,142,16

However, few studies have focused on the safety and feasibility of adopting this new technique. The present study aimed to review the surgical outcomes after the initial experience of performing ICBI anastomosis and to evaluate whether this technique can be safely adopted without increasing operative risk during the early learning process. METHODS Forty-two consecutive patients who underwent ICBI anastomosis with laparoscopic distal gastrectomy by a single surgeon were enrolled, and their operative outcomes and hospital course were compared with those of 179 patients who underwent conventional extracorporeal Billroth I (ECBI) anastomosis by the same operator. The learning curve was assessed by evaluating the moving average of anastomosis time. RESULTS The operating time in the ICBI group was significantly longer than that in the ECBI group (142 vs. 116 min, p < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences in the postoperative hospital course such as gas passage, diet initiation, postoperative fever, and hospital stay between the two groups. Postoperative morbidity did not significantly differ between the ICBI and ECBI groups (7.1 vs. 12.3 %, p = 0.428). No anastomosis-related complications occurred in the ICBI group. The mean anastomosis time for ICBI anastomosis was 24 ± 5 min, and the anastomosis average time curve showed that it reached a plateau approximately after the 14th case. CONCLUSIONS ICBI anastomosis has a steep learning curve without increasing operative risk in the early learning process, when performed by experienced laparoscopic surgeons. The technical feasibility and clinical advantages of intracorporeal anastomosis need to be proven in future clinical trials.","Jeong, Oh; Jung, Mi Ran; Park, Young Kyu; Ryu, Seong Yeop",Surgical endoscopy,142,1

Indeed, infectious complications have been a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. This review chronicles the progress in defining and developing approaches to the management of fever and neutropenia through observational and controlled clinical trials done by single institutions, as well as by national and international collaborative groups. The resultant data have led to recommendations and guidelines from professional societies and frame the current principles of management. Recommendations include those guiding new treatment options (from monotherapy to oral antibiotic therapy) and use of prophylactic antimicrobial regimens in high-risk patients. Of note, risk factors have changed with the advent of hematopoietic cytokines (especially granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) in shortening the duration of neutropenia, as well as with the discovery of more targeted cancer treatments that do not result in cytotoxicity, although these are still the exception. Most guiding principles that were developed decades ago-about when to begin empirical treatment after a neutropenic patient becomes febrile, whether and how to modify the initial treatment regimen (especially in patients with protracted neutropenia), and how long to continue antimicrobial therapy-are still used today. This review describes how the treatment principles related to the management of fever and neutropenia have responded to changes in the patients at risk, the microbes responsible, and the tools for their treatment, while still being sustained over the arc of time.","Pizzo, Philip A",Annals of internal medicine,142,12

STUDY DESIGN A retrospective review of billing data. SETTING A large-volume practice with both community and tertiary care providers. METHODS As part of a quality initiative, billing data were queried to identify children <18 years of age who underwent tympanostomy tube placement between January 2019 and December 2020. Patient age, practice location, and case numbers were gathered. RESULTS The study included data from 2652 patients. Prior to state-mandated clinic and operating room restrictions, there were no significant differences in the number of tympanostomy tubes placed (P = .64), including month-to-month comparisons, the distribution of patients being cared for at community vs tertiary care sites (P = .63), or patient age at the time of surgery (P = .97) between 2019 and 2020. After resumption of outpatient clinical and elective surgical activities, the number of tympanostomy tubes placed decreased significantly between 2019 and 2020 (831 vs 303 cases, P = .003), with a persistent month-to-month difference. In addition, patients undergoing tube placement were older (4.5 vs 3.2 years, P < .001). The distribution of cases performed in the community setting decreased during this time period as well (P < .001). CONCLUSION During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of pediatric tympanostomy tube placement has significantly decreased. The age of patients undergoing surgery has increased, and more children are being cared for in a tertiary setting. These findings may reflect changes in the prevalence of acute and chronic otitis media as the result of the pandemic.","Diercks, Gillian R; Cohen, Michael S",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,142,1

Barbed suturing is a new technology that has the potential to greatly facilitate laparoscopic suturing. AIM To compare surgical outcomes and vaginal vault healing between barbed sutures and traditional sutures in the repair of the vaginal vault during single-port TLH. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between August 2013 and June 2015, we performed single-port TLH in 85 consecutive patients for benign or premalignant gynecological conditions. The first 48 patients underwent single-port TLH with traditional interrupted sutures, and the next 37 patients underwent single-port TLH with absorbable unidirectional knotless barbed sutures for repair of the vaginal vault. RESULTS The patient characteristics (age, body mass index), procedures performed, uterine weight, and uterine disease were similar between the groups. There were no differences in blood loss, hemoglobin change, length of hospital stay, or perioperative complications. Operative time and the time required for vaginal cuff suturing were significantly shorter in the barbed suture group than in the traditional suture group (57.8 ±13.5 vs. 80.1 ±18.7 min, p < 0.001; 5.5 ±1.7 vs. 12.9 ±3.5 min, p < 0.001). Moreover, the use of barbed sutures significantly reduced the incidence of vaginal granulation tissue formation (2.7% vs. 35.4%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Use of barbed sutures in single-port TLH reduced the operative time, suturing time of the vaginal vault, and formation of vaginal granulation tissue. Barbed suturing may help overcome surgical difficulties and vaginal cuff complications.","Lee, Yoon Hee; Chong, Gun Oh; Kim, Mi Ju; Gy Hong, Dae; Lee, Yoon Soon",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,142,1

However, little is known about the impact of the pandemic in PICUs. In this qualitative study, we aimed to assess pediatric critical care providers' perspectives on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the experiences of patients and families in the PICU and on their personal and professional lives. METHODS Nineteen pediatric critical care and complex care attending physicians and nurse practitioners from a PICU in a tertiary, freestanding children's hospital in the Midwest completed a semistructured, qualitative interview. Transcripts were analyzed by using thematic analysis. RESULTS For both PICU providers and patients and families, participants described a negative overall impact of the pandemic, especially relating to increased stress and fear of contracting the disease. Disease precautions such as visitor restrictions and restricting movement were reported to be particularly stressful for families because they limited coping strategies (eg, in-person social support). Providers described changes to the work environment, patient care, and their personal lives. CONCLUSIONS Results elucidate the perceived impacts of COVID-19 and associated hospital precautions on the lives of PICU providers, patients, and families. Providers, patients, and families likely require additional psychosocial support during the pandemic. When possible, policies regarding disease management should maximize safety while minimizing additional stress. Further research is needed to explore patient and family perspectives regarding the impact of COVID-19 and to evaluate the continued impact of COVID-19 over time.","Balistreri, Kathryn A; Lim, Paulina S; Tager, Julia B; Davies, W Hobart; Karst, Jeffrey S; Scanlon, Matthew C; Rothschild, Charles B",Hospital pediatrics,142,16

Maintaining a stable PD catheter position, independent of body position, omental wrapping or catheter displacement secondary to bowel movements is essential in maintaining effective catheter function. METHODS We developed a new procedure of catheter placement through combining and adapting several previously described operative techniques including laparoscopic placement of a curled double cuff Tenckhoff catheter with subcutaneous tunneling superior to the rectus sheet, an oblique course through the abdominal wall, deep entry into the pelvic peritoneum and directed placement of the curled tip within the pouch of Douglas. Retrospective analysis of catheter function was conducted, evaluating catheter position, function, complication rate and catheter survival against findings for current insertion techniques described within literature. RESULTS Between March 2009 and November 2011, 54 patients underwent PD catheter insertion. The observation period was an average of 343 ± 273 days. All patients received abdominal plain film showing optimal catheter position in 89 %. Reported catheter function was very good in 85.2 %, with no or few alarms per week during APD, moderate in 9.3 % with occasional minor dysfunctions (≤ 2 alarms per night), and poor in 5.6 %, with regular alarm disturbance. In one case, primary dysfunction led to catheter replacement. At completion, stable catheter function with occasional minor dysfunction was achieved in 52 of 54 cases. Catheter-related complications (leakage, hydrocele formation, infection and need for replacement) were observed in 14.8 %. At the end of the observation period, 55.6 % of catheters remained in use. Patient dropout occurred through death (18.5 %), renal transplantation (7.4 %), renal recovery (1.9 %), removal secondary to infection or dysfunction (9.3 %) and conversion to HD due to poor dialysis quality (7.4 %). CONCLUSION The above technique combines and optimises previously described laparoscopic catheter implantation techniques, allowing increased catheter stability resulting in an undisturbed catheter function suitable for APD.","Meier, Clemens M; Poppleton, Aaron; Fliser, Danilo; Klingele, Matthias",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,142,19

The ante-mortem diagnosis of FIP in clinical cases is still challenging. In cats without effusion, a definitive diagnosis can only be achieved post mortem or with invasive methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of a combined reverse transcriptase nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) and sequencing approach in the diagnosis of FIP, detecting mutations at two different nucleotide positions within the spike (S) gene. Methods The study population consisted of 64 cats with confirmed FIP and 63 cats in which FIP was initially suspected due to similar clinical or laboratory signs, but that were definitively diagnosed with another disease. Serum/plasma and/or effusion samples of these cats were examined for feline coronavirus (FCoV) RNA by RT-nPCR and, if positive, PCR products were sequenced for nucleotide transitions within the S gene. Results Specificity of RT-nPCR was 100% in all materials (95% confidence interval [CI] in serum/plasma 83.9-100.0; 95% CI in effusion 93.0-100.0). The specificity of the sequencing step could not be determined as none of the cats of the control group tested positive for FCoV RNA. Sensitivity of the 'combined RT-nPCR and sequencing approach' was 6.5% (95% CI 0.8-21.4) in serum/plasma and 65.3% (95% CI 50.4-78.3) in effusion. Conclusions and relevance A positive result is highly indicative of the presence of FIP, but as none of the control cats tested positive by RT-nPCR, it was not possible to confirm that the FCoV mutant described can only be found in cats with FIP. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the usefulness of the sequencing step including FCoV-RNA-positive cats with and without FIP. A negative result cannot be used to exclude the disease, especially when only serum/plasma samples are available.","Felten, Sandra; Weider, Karola; Doenges, Stephanie; Gruendl, Stefanie; Matiasek, Kaspar; Hermanns, Walter; Mueller, Elisabeth; Matiasek, Lara; Fischer, Andrea; Weber, Karin; Hirschberger, Johannes; Wess, Gerhard; Hartmann, Katrin",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,142,27

Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) often occurs with hemoglobinuria, and its underlying pathophysiological mechanism is unknown. Heme can trigger inflammation by inducing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the production of inﬂammatory mediators. We therefore investigated whether circulating heme is involved in SIRS following RFA of hepatic hemangiomas. METHODS We enrolled 65 patients with hepatic hemangioma who underwent RFA. Serum concentrations of free heme, ROS, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) were measured after RFA. Univariate analysis and a multivariate binary logistic regression model were used to evaluate the contribution of 17 risk factors for SIRS after RFA. RESULTS Fifty-nine (59/65, 90.8%) patients developed hemoglobinuria, among which 25 (25/59, 42.4%) experienced SIRS shortly after RFA. In the SIRS group, the serum concentrations of heme, ROS, and TNF-α were immediately elevated after RFA compared with baseline and slowly regained their normal levels 3 days after RFA. Moreover, the concentrations of circulating heme significantly correlated with those of ROS (r = 0.805, P < 0.001) and TNF-α (r = 0.797, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the volume of hemangioma [odds ratio (OR) = 1.293, P = 0.031], time of ablation (OR = 1.194, P = 0.029) as well as the concentrations of heme (OR = 1.430, P = 0.017), ROS (OR = 1.251, P = 0.031), and TNF-α (OR = 1.309, P = 0.032) were significantly associated with SIRS. CONCLUSION Circulating heme was associated with the induction of ROS and the production of TNF-α, which may contribute to the induction of SIRS following RFA of hepatic hemangiomas.","Yang, Xu; Liu, Jun; Yang, Meng-Meng; Wang, Shao-Hong; Xu, Li; Ke, Shan; Ding, Xue-Mei; Sun, Wen-Bing; Gao, Jun",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,142,1

We performed a systematic review with statistical pooling to estimate the formation rate, distribution and severity of postoperative adhesions in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. A literature search was carried out for all articles reporting on the incidence, distribution and severity of adhesions between January 1990 and July 2011. Twenty-five articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The weighted mean formation rate of adhesions after abdominal surgery was 54 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 40-68 %), and was 66 % (95 % CI 38-94 %) after gastrointestinal surgery, 51 % (95 % CI 40-63 %) after obstetric and gynaecological surgery and 22 % (95 % CI 7-38 %) after urological surgery. The mean overall severity score was 1.11 ± 0.98 according to the Operative Laparoscopy Study Group classification. Laparoscopic surgery reduced the adhesion formation rate by 25 % and decreased the adhesion severity score (laparoscopic; 0.36 ± 0.69 vs. open; 2.14 ± 0.84) for gastrointestinal surgery. Our results demonstrate that the incidence and severity of abdominal adhesions varies between surgical specialties and procedures. An increased awareness of adhesions can help in identifying the underlying mechanisms of adhesion formation and novel therapeutic approaches, while also improving the surgical consent process.","Okabayashi, Koji; Ashrafian, Hutan; Zacharakis, Emmanouil; Hasegawa, Hirotoshi; Kitagawa, Yuko; Athanasiou, Thanos; Darzi, Ara",Surgery today,142,12

Patients starting TAC require careful dose adjustment, owing to the wide range of optimal dosages, depending on their CYP3A5 expression status. Here, we evaluated whether individualization of TAC dosages based on CYP3A5 SNPs would improve its therapeutic efficacy in ulcerative colitis. METHODS Twenty-one patients were prospectively treated, with their initial dosage adjusted according to their CYP3A5 status (0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 mg/kg/day for CYP3A5*3/*3, CYP3A5*1/*3, and CYP3A5*1/*1, respectively). Their clinical outcomes were compared with those of patients treated with a fixed dose (0.1 mg/kg/day). RESULTS The first blood trough level of CYP3A5 expressors, CYP3A5*1/*3 or CYP3A5*1/*1, and the overall rate in achieving the target blood trough level within a week in the individualized-dose group were significantly higher than those in the fixed-dose group (5.15±2.33 ng/mL vs. 9.63±0.79 ng/mL, P=0.035 and 12.5% vs. 66.7%, P=0.01).

The coincident comorbidities can increase the risk of traditional treatments for tumor embolus in each region. CASE REPORT A young patient with previously unknown cardiac myxoma presented with seizure and was found to have stress cardiomyopathy, multiple cerebral large vessel occlusions with acute ischemic stroke, bilateral lower extremity tumor emboli and rhabdomyolysis, and renal tumor embolus with acute tubular necrosis. We describe a multidisciplinary approach applying cerebrovascular stent retriever devices in tumor embolectomy of the renal artery of a young patient with systemic morbidity, preventing safe laparotomy for open surgical tumor embolectomy. CONCLUSION We describe 2-month renal function outcomes and the considerations in applying a neuroendovascular mechanical thrombectomy device within the renal artery. This was a radiographically successful technique and her renal function appears to be improving at the 2-month follow-up, although this is complicated by other renal insults and support.","Silva, Michael A; See, Alfred P; Shah, Samir K; Khandelwal, Priyank; Patel, Nirav J; Lyu, Heather; Menard, Matthew T; Aziz-Sultan, Mohammad Ali",Vascular and endovascular surgery,142,20

We hypothesized that elevated preoperative heart rate increases the risk of myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINS). METHODS We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective international cohort study of patients aged ≥45 yr undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Preoperative heart rate was defined as the last measurement before induction of anaesthesia. The sample was divided into deciles by heart rate. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine relationships between preoperative heart rate and MINS (determined by serum troponin concentration), myocardial infarction (MI), and death within 30 days of surgery. Separate models were used to test the relationship between these outcomes and predefined binary heart rate thresholds. RESULTS Patients with missing outcomes or heart rate data were excluded from respective analyses. Of 15 087 patients, 1197 (7.9%) sustained MINS, 454 of 16 007 patients (2.8%) sustained MI, and 315 of 16 037 patients (2.0%) died. The highest heart rate decile (>96 beats min(-1)) was independently associated with MINS {odds ratio (OR) 1.48 [1.23-1.77]; P<0.01}, MI (OR 1.71 [1.34-2.18]; P<0.01), and mortality (OR 3.16 [2.45-4.07]; P<0.01). The lowest decile (<60 beats min(-1)) was independently associated with reduced mortality (OR 0.50 [0.29-0.88]; P=0.02), but not MINS or MI. The predefined binary thresholds were also associated with MINS, but more weakly than the highest heart rate decile. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative heart rate >96 beats min(-1) is associated with MINS, MI, and mortality after non-cardiac surgery. This association persists after accounting for potential confounding factors.

As the host genes of the small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), they are commonly localized in the nucleolus, where they exert multiple regulatory functions orchestrating cellular homeostasis and differentiation as well as metastasis and chemoresistance. Indeed, worldwide literature has reported their involvement in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of different histotypes of cancer, being able to exploit peculiar features, for example, the possibility to act both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Moreover, SNHGs regulation is a fundamental topic to better understand their role in tumor progression albeit such mechanism is still debated.

Because seminal plasma creates the environment for the proper functioning of spermatozoa, in this study, we verified the associations among standard spermiograms, seminal biochemical parameters (neutral alpha-glucosidase, fructose, and citric acid) and oxidative stress markers (total antioxidant capacity, catalase activity, superoxide dismutase activity, and malondialdehyde concentration) in distinct entities associated with male infertility with and without long-time exposure to local hyperthermia. We demonstrated that men exposed to prolonged environmental or clinically recognized local heat stress in adulthood may suffer from dysregulation of seminal antioxidant components, which can be directly associated with epididymal and prostate function. The comparative analysis of the studied parameters showed numerous correlations among all biochemical parameters (particularly neutral alpha-glucosidase) with low standard semen quality in almost all the investigated infertile groups. In light of the data obtained in this originally designed study, we conclude that more attention should be paid to the epididymis and accessory gland function in subfertile and infertile men exposed to genital heat stress, especially in the context of novel treatment algorithms (targeted therapies).","Fraczek, Monika; Wojnar, Lukasz; Kamieniczna, Marzena; Piasecka, Malgorzata; Gill, Kamil; Kups, Michal; Chopyak, Valentina; Havrylyuk, Anna; Nakonechnyy, Jozef; Nakonechnyy, Andrij; Wozniak, Tomasz; Kurpisz, Maciej",International journal of molecular sciences,142,13

The balance between the dynamic pressure in the flow and the restoring capillary pressure in the interasperity spaces determines the stability of the Cassie state of wettability and is a function of the relative extent of no-slip and free shear regions per unit surface area. In the present study, using a fractal representation of rough surface topography, an analytical model is developed to quantify the stability of the Cassie state of wettability as well as drag reduction and the friction factor for laminar flow in a rectangular channel between nonwetting multiscale rough surfaces. A systematic study is conducted to quantify the effects of fractal parameters of the surfaces and the flow Reynolds number on drag reduction and the friction factor. The studies are used to develop friction factor curves extending the classical Moody diagram to hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces. On the basis of the studies, regime maps are derived for estimating the extent of drag reduction offered by hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces, revealing that superhydrophobic surfaces do not always offer the best drag reduction performance. The application of the fractal model to practical topographies of nonwetting surfaces of copper, aluminum, and zinc oxide fabricated via electrodeposition and etching is also discussed.","Hatte, S; Pitchumani, R",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,142,22

As such, the purpose of this study was to examine walking pattern variability by way of lower extremity coordination and spatio-temporal characteristics in children with autism compared with individuals with typical development during over-ground walking. METHODS Bilateral continuous relative phase variability was computed for the thigh-leg, leg-foot, and thigh-foot segment couples for 11 children with autism and 9 children with typical development at each gait sub-phase. Furthermore, left and right stride lengths and stride width were computed and compared. The Model Statistic was utilized to test for statistical differences in variability between each child with autism to an aggregate group with typical development. Effect sizes were computed to determine the meaningfulness between responses for children with autism and typical development. Coefficient of variation and effect sizes were computed for stride lengths and stride width. FINDINGS Analysis revealed that children with autism exhibited differences in variability in each gait sub-phase. Notably, all but two children with autism exhibited lesser variability in all segment couples during terminal swing. Differences in stride lengths were relatively minimal, however, greater coefficient of variation magnitudes in stride width were observed in children with autism. INTERPRETATION This finding reveals that children with autism may have limited or a preferred movement strategy when preparing the foot for ground contact. The findings from this study suggest variability may be an identifiable characteristic during movement in children with autism.","Eggleston, Jeffrey D; Harry, John R; Cereceres, Patrick A; Olivas, Alyssa N; Chavez, Emily A; Boyle, Jason B; Dufek, Janet S",Clinical biomechanics,142,28

MATERIALS AND METHODS A web-based questionnaire was designed to differentiate the impact of the pandemic on inpatient and outpatient nuclear medicine operations and on public versus private health systems, respectively. Questions were addressing the following issues: impact on nuclear medicine diagnostics and therapy, use of recommendations, personal protective equipment, and organizational adaptations. The survey was available for 6 days and closed on April 20, 2020. RESULTS 113 complete responses were recorded. Nearly all participants (97 %) report a decline of nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures. The mean reduction in the last three weeks for PET/CT, scintigraphies of bone, myocardium, lung thyroid, sentinel lymph-node are -14.4 %, -47.2 %, -47.5 %, -40.7 %, -58.4 %, and -25.2 % respectively. Furthermore, 76 % of the participants report a reduction in therapies especially for benign thyroid disease (-41.8 %) and radiosynoviorthesis (-53.8 %) while tumor therapies remained mainly stable. 48 % of the participants report a shortage of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS Nuclear medicine services are notably reduced 3 weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reached Germany, Austria and Switzerland on a large scale. We must be aware that the current crisis will also have a significant economic impact on the healthcare system. As the survey cannot adapt to daily dynamic changes in priorities, it serves as a first snapshot requiring follow-up studies and comparisons with other countries and regions.","Freudenberg, Lutz S; Dittmer, Ulf; Herrmann, Ken",Nuklearmedizin.

When the tumor is located in the intraluminal stomach, two minimally invasive surgical procedures involving laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) or endoscopic intragastric surgery (EIGS) are frequently performed. To date, there have been no comparative studies of LECS and EIGS in patients with intraluminal gastric GISTs regarding short-term and long-term outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare the safety and feasibility of LECS and EIGS in patients with intraluminal gastric GISTs. METHODS This was a single-center retrospective study of 46 consecutive patients with intraluminal gastric GISTs who underwent minimally invasive surgery. LECS (n = 21) was performed between 2013 and 2015 and EIGS (n = 26) was performed between 2001 and 2013. RESULTS The overall incidence of perioperative complications was significantly higher in the EIGS group than in the LECS group (40 vs 4.8%; P = 0.006). In the EIGS group, three patients with intraoperative gastric mucosal injury were followed-up throughout surgical repair (12%). An esophageal tear was found in one patient during oral removal of tumor (4%). Postoperative gastric hemorrhage occurred in three patients (12%) and superficial surgical site infection was observed in three patients (12%). In the LECS group, anastomotic leakage requiring additional drainage was observed in one patient (4.8%). EIGS had less favorable results regarding median time to resumption of first oral intake (2 vs 1 days; P = 0.005). Two of 46 patients (4.3%), including one patient who underwent LECS and one patient who underwent EIGS developed recurrence. No cause-specific deaths were observed. CONCLUSION LECS is a feasible and safe procedure for intraluminal gastric GISTs with regard to both short-term surgical and long-term oncological outcomes.

Presently, there is a lack of robust and analytically validated markers for predicting and early diagnosis of DILI. Sphingolipid metabolism and subsequent disruption of sphingolipid homeostasis has been documented to play a key role contributing to hepatocellular death and subsequent liver injury. A more comprehensive understanding of sphingolipid metabolism in response to liver toxicity has great potential to gain mechanistic insight into hepatotoxicity and define molecular markers that are responsible for hepatocyte dysfunction. Here, we present an analytical platform that provides multidimensional mass spectrometry-based datasets for comprehensive structure characterization of sphingolipids extracted from human primary hepatocytes (HPH) exposed to toxic levels of acetaminophen (APAP). Sphingolipid metabolism as measured by characterization of individual sphingolipid structure was sensitive to APAP toxicity displaying a concentration-dependent response. A number of sphingolipid structures were differentially expressed across varying APAP exposures highlighting the unique role sphingolipid metabolism has in response to hepatotoxicity and its potential use as a molecular marker in DILI.","Li, Linhao; Wang, Hongbing; Jones, Jace W",Prostaglandins & other lipid mediators,142,1

Frailty is an important geriatric syndrome affecting a minority of PHW. Frailty negatively affects PHW's clinical status and quality of life. This review will update care providers on the current state of frailty that limits the healthspan of PWH. RECENT FINDINGS Ongoing low-level HIV replication in treated PWH leads to immune activation and chronic inflammation contributing to the destabilization of normally autoregulated physiologic systems in response to environmental and biologic challenges characteristic of frailty. Understanding these underlying mechanisms will determine potential intervention options. Potentially reversible risk factors that promote progression to and reversion from the dynamic state of frailty are being studied and will help prevent frailty. Simple assessment tools and treatment strategies for frailty are being adapted for aging PWH.

Recent cancer research is now utilizing the medicinal chemistry toolbox to tailor novel 'smart' carrier systems that can reduce the major limitations of chemotherapy ranging from non-specificity and ubiquitous biodistribution to systemic toxicity. In this aspect, various stimuli-responsive polymers have gained considerable interest due to their intrinsic tumor targeting properties. Among these polymers, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAM) has been chemically modified to tune its thermoresponsivity or even copolymerized to endow new stimulus responsiveness for enhancing tumor targeting. Herein, we set our design rationale to impart additional active targeting entity to pH/temperature-responsive PNIPAM-based polymer for more efficient controlled payloads accumulation at the tumor through cellular internalization via synthesizing novel ""super intelligent"" lactoferrin conjugated PNIPAM-acrylic acid (LF-PNIPAM-co-AA) copolymer. The synthesized copolymer was physicochemically characterized and evaluated as a smart nanocarrier for targeting breast cancer. In this regard, Honokiol (HK) was utilized as a model anticancer drug and encapsulated in the nanoparticles to overcome its lipophilic nature and allow its parenteral administration, for achieving sustainable drug release with targeting action. Results showed that the developed HK-loaded LF-PNIPAM-co-AA nanohydrogels displayed high drug loading capacity reaching to 18.65 wt.% with excellent physical and serum stability. Moreover, the prepared HK-loaded nanohydrogels exhibited efficient in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities. In vivo, HK-loaded nanohydrogels demonstrated suppression of VEGF-1 and Ki-67 expression levels, besides inducing apoptosis through upregulating the expression level of active caspase-3 in breast cancer-bearing mice.

METHODS Horizontal full-thickness wall defects (3.5 cm) of cattle rectal specimens were closed via transanal endoscopic microsurgery using a monofilament suture with clips at the end (Surgipro(®) 2/0; Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA, n = 25) or a self-retaining barbed suture (V-Loc™ 180 3/0; Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA, n = 25). The primary endpoint was the pneumatic leakage pressure of the suture line. As a secondary endpoint, suture time was evaluated. RESULTS The median pneumatic leakage pressure for barbed sutures was 45.5 mbar (range 17-106 mbar) and 33.5 mbar (range 19-106 mbar) for monofilament sutures (p = 0.58). A pneumatic leak at a critical pressure below 25 mbar occurred in 3 cases with barbed sutures and in 7 cases with monofilament sutures (p = 0.29). Median suturing time [19:25 min:s (range 12:00-33:30) vs. 20:41 (17:00-28:33), p = 0.23] did not differ between the two groups.

In this study, we evaluated bacterial load and blood leukocyte transcriptomic responses of 3-week-old turkeys challenged with the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) UK1 strain. Turkeys (n = 8/dose) were inoculated by oral gavage with 108 or 1010 colony forming units (CFU) of S.

Fecal shedding was 1-2 log10 higher in the 1010 CFU group than the 108 CFU group, but both doses effectively colonized the crop, spleen, ileum, cecum, colon, bursa of Fabricius and cloaca without causing any detectable clinical signs in either group of birds. Blood leukocytes were isolated from a subset of the birds (n = 3-4/dpi) both pre-inoculation (0 dpi) and 2 dpi with 1010 CFU and their transcriptomic responses assayed by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). At 2 dpi, 647 genes had significant differential expression (DE), including large increases in expression of immune genes such as CCAH221, IL4I1, LYZ, IL13RA2, IL22RA2, and ACOD1. IL1β was predicted as a major regulator of DE in the leukocytes, which was predicted to activate cell migration, phagocytosis and proliferation, and to impact the STAT3 and toll-like receptor pathways. These analyses revealed genes and pathways by which turkey blood leukocytes responded to the pathogen and can provide potential targets for developing intervention strategies or diagnostic assays to mitigate S. Typhimurium colonization in turkeys.","Monson, Melissa S; Bearson, Bradley L; Sylte, Matthew J; Looft, Torey; Lamont, Susan J; Bearson, Shawn M D",Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,142,1

In this paper, we distinguish public health ethics from clinical ethics, research ethics, public health law and politics. We then discuss issues in public health ethics including: how to weigh up the benefits, harms and costs of intervening; how to ensure that public health interventions produce fair outcomes; the potential for public health to undermine or promote the rights of citizens; and the significance of being transparent and inclusive in public health interventions. We conclude that the explicit and systematic consideration of ethical issues will, and should, become central to every public health worker's daily practice.","Carter, Stacy M; Kerridge, Ian; Sainsbury, Peter; Letts, Julie K",New South Wales public health bulletin,142,12

DESIGN This was a randomized controlled trial. SETTING A total of 59 assisted living facilities in Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts participated. PARTICIPANTS The sample included 550 mostly White (98%), female (69%) residents with a mean age of 89.30 (standard deviation = 7.63) years. INTERVENTION The four-step FFC-AL-EIT intervention was implemented by a function focused care nurse facilitator working with a facility champion over 12 months. The steps included: (1) environment and policy assessments; (2) education; (3) establishing resident function focused care service plans; and (4) mentoring and motivating. MEASURES Resident descriptive data (e.g., age, sex, education, and comorbidities), depression, agitation, resistiveness to care, and the quality of care interactions were obtained at baseline and 4 and 12 months. Treatment fidelity data included environment and policy assessments, performance of function focused care by staff, and service plan assessments. RESULTS There was a significant positive treatment effect related to depression, agitation, resistiveness to care, and quality of care interactions with either less decline or some improvement in these behaviors and symptoms in the treatment versus control group. CONCLUSION The study provides some statistical support, which may not necessarily be clinically significant evidence, for psychosocial outcomes of residents and care interactions between staff and residents in assisted living settings.","Resnick, Barbara; Boltz, Marie; Galik, Elizabeth; Fix, Steven; Holmes, Sarah; Zhu, Shijun; Barr, Erik",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,142,27

The present study aims to investigate the effect of wildfire allied pollutants, particulate matter (PM-2.5 μm), and carbon monoxide (CO) on the dynamics of daily cases and deaths due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in San Francisco, USA. MATERIALS AND METHODS For this study, we selected San Francisco, one of the regions affected by the wildfires allied pollution in California, USA. The data on the COVID-19 pandemic in San Francisco, including daily new cases and new deaths were recorded from Worldometer Web. The daily environmental pollutants particulate matter (PM-2.5 μm) and carbon monoxide (CO) were recorded from the metrological web ""BAAQMD"". The daily cases, deaths, particulate matter (PM-2.5 μm) and carbon monoxide were documented from the date of the occurrence of the first case of (SARS-CoV-2) in San Francisco, CA, USA, from March 20, 2020 to Sept 16, 2020. RESULTS The results revealed a significant positive correlation between the environmental pollutants particulate matter (PM2.5 μm) and the number of daily cases (r=0.203, p=0.007), cumulative cases (r=0.567, p<0.001) and cumulative deaths (r=0.562, p<0.001); whereas the PM2.5 μm and daily deaths had no relationship (r=-0.015, p=0.842). In addition, CO was also positively correlated with cumulative cases (r=0.423, p<0.001) and cumulative deaths (r=0.315, p<0.001), however, CO had no correlation with the number of daily cases (r=0.134, p=0.075) and daily deaths (r=0.030, p=0.693). In San Francisco, one micrometer (μg/m3) increase in PM2.5 caused an increase in the daily cases, cumulative cases and cumulative deaths of SARS-COV-2 by 0.5%, 0.9% and 0.6%, respectively. Moreover, with a 1 part per million (ppm) increase in carbon monoxide level, the daily number of cases, cumulative cases and cumulative deaths increased by 5%, 9.3% and 5.3%, respectively. On the other hand, CO and daily deaths had no significant relationship. CONCLUSIONS The wildfire allied pollutants, particulate matter PM-2.5μm and CO have a positive association with an increased number of SARS-COV-2 daily cases, cumulative cases and cumulative deaths in San Francisco. The metrological, disaster management and health officials must implement the necessary policies and assist in planning to minimize the wildfire incidences, environmental pollution and COVID-19 pandemic both at regional and international levels.","Meo, S A; Abukhalaf, A A; Alomar, A A; Alessa, O M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,142,20

Initial response to this pandemic involved the development, production, and distribution of diagnostic molecular assays at an unprecedented rate, leading to minimal validation requirements and concerns regarding their diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings. In addition to molecular testing, serological assays to detect antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are now becoming available from numerous diagnostic manufacturers. In both cases, the lack of peer-reviewed data and regulatory oversight, combined with general misconceptions regarding their appropriate use, have highlighted the importance of laboratory professionals in robustly validating and evaluating these assays for appropriate clinical use. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Task Force on COVID-19 has been established to synthesize up-to-date information on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19, as well as to develop practical recommendations on the use of molecular, serological, and biochemical tests in disease diagnosis and management. This review summarizes the latest evidence and status of molecular, serological, and biochemical testing in COVID-19 and highlights some key considerations for clinical laboratories operating to support the global fight against this ongoing pandemic.

In the last years, advances in functional and genetic testing have improved the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to immune dysregulation syndromes. CTLA-4 deficiency is a rare disease with variable phenotype, ranging from absence of symptoms to severe multisystem manifestations and complications. We describe a rare case of CTLA-4 deficiency in a boy with gastric cancer, very early onset inflammatory bowel disease and polyautoimmunity, the second-ever reported in the literature with the same characteristics. A 17-year-old boy was referred to Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital of Rome, a tertiary care center, for a gastric mass and a long-term history of very early onset inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, polyarthritis and psoriasis. Histology of gastric biopsies revealed the presence of neoplastic signet ring cells. Imaging staging showed localized cancer; therefore, the patient underwent subtotal gastrectomy with termino-lateral gastro-jejunal anastomosis. Immunological work up and genetic testing by next-generation sequencing panels for primary immunodeficiencies led to the diagnosis of CTLA-4 deficiency. Good disease control was obtained with the administration of Abatacept. The patient experienced an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection without any concern. Eighteen months after treatment initiation, the patient is alive and well. Immunologic and genetic testing, such as next-generation sequencing, should always be part of the diagnostic approach to patients with complex immune dysregulation syndrome, severe clinical course, poor response to treatments or cancer.

Nevertheless high failure rates and severe complications have been reported. We conducted this study to evaluate if the usage of the new gastric tube guide would speed up the placement of orogastric tubes and ease the procedure. METHODS Thirty one professionals were given a hands-on-training in orogastric tube placement in a simulation manikin without and with the gastric tube guide. Afterwards they performed both methods in randomized order. We recorded the placement time, counted the required attempts and asked the participants to rate their experience with both methods. RESULTS The median placement time using the gastric tube guide was 14 s compared to 25 s without the device. In addition all participants were able to place the orogastric tube when using the gastric tube guide compared to 26/31 (84%) without it. Furthermore 26/31 (84%) users preferred the gastric tube guide over the standard method.

Oxidative stress and its related metabolic syndromes are potential risk factors in the susceptibility to, and severity of COVID-19. In concert with the earliest reports of COVID-19, obstetricians started to diagnose and treat SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy (""COVID-19-Pregnancy""). High metabolic demand to sustain normal fetal development increases the burden of oxidative stress in pregnancy. Intracellular redox changes intertwined with acute phase responses at the maternal-fetal interface could amplify during pregnancy. Interestingly, mother-to-fetus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in most of the COVID-19-Pregnancy cases. This relative absence of vertical transmission may be related to the presence of lactoferrin in the placenta, amniotic fluid, and lacteal secretions. However, the cytokine-storm induced during COVID-19-Pregnancy may cause severe inflammatory damage to the fetus, and if uncontrolled, may later result in autism spectrum-like disorders and brain development abnormalities in neonates. Considering this serious health threat to child growth and development, the prevention of COVID-19 during pregnancy should be considered a high priority.

94517,94517,94517,The next epidemic--lessons from Ebola.,13.530693,7.312433,2015,"INTRODUCTION High-resolution esophageal manometry (HREM) is essential in characterizing achalasia subtype and the extent of affected segment to plan the myotomy starting point during per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). However, evidence is lacking that efficacy is improved by tailoring myotomy to the length of the spastic segment on HREM. We sought to investigate whether utilizing HREM to dictate myotomy length in POEM impacts postoperative outcomes. METHODS Comparative analysis of HREM-tailored to non-tailored patients from a prospectively collected database of all POEMs at our institution January 2011 through July 2017. A tailored myotomy is defined as extending at least the length of the diseased segment, as initially measured on HREM. RESULTS Forty patients were included (11 tailored versus 29 non-tailored). There were no differences in patient age (p = 0.6491) or BMI (p = 0.0677). Myotomy lengths were significantly longer for tailored compared to non-tailored overall (16.6 ± 2.2 versus 13.5 ± 1.8; p < 0.0001), and for only type III achalasia (15.9 ± 2.4 versus 12.7 ± 1.2; p = 0.0453), likely due to more proximal starting position in tailored cases (26.0 ± 2.2 versus 30.0 ± 2.7; p < 0.0001). Procedure success (Eckardt < 3) was equivalent across groups overall (p = 0.5558), as was postoperative Eckardt score (0.2 ± 0.4 versus 0.8 ± 2.3; p = 0.4004). Postoperative Eckardt score was significantly improved in the tailored group versus non-tailored for type III only (0.2 ± 0.4 versus 1.3 ± 1.5; p = 0.0435). A linear correlation was seen between increased length and greater improvement in Eckardt score in the non-tailored group (p = 0.0170). CONCLUSIONS Using HREM to inform surgeons of the proximal location of the diseased segment resulted in longer myotomies, spanning the entire affected segment in type III achalasia, and in lower postoperative Eckardt scores. Longer myotomy length is often more easily achieved with POEM than with Heller myotomy, which raises the question of whether POEM results in better outcomes for type III achalasia, as types I and II do not generally have measurable spastic segments.","Kane, Erica D; Budhraja, Vikram; Desilets, David J; Romanelli, John R",Surgical endoscopy,142,33

With the introduction of targeted temperature management more than a decade ago, postresuscitation care has attracted increased attention. In the present review, we discuss best practice hospital management of unconscious out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with a special focus on targeted temperature management. What is termed post-cardiac arrest syndrome strikes all organs and mandates access to specialized intensive care. All patients need a secured airway, and most patients need hemodynamic support with fluids and/or vasopressors. Furthermore, immediate coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention, when indicated, has become an essential part of the postresuscitation treatment. Targeted temperature management with controlled sedation and mechanical ventilation is the most important neuroprotective strategy to take. Targeted temperature management should be initiated as quickly as possible, and according to international guidelines, it should be maintained at 32° to 36°C for at least 24 h, whereas rewarming should not increase more than 0.5°C per hour. However, uncertainty remains regarding targeted temperature management components, warranting further research into the optimal cooling rate, target temperature, duration of cooling, and the rewarming rate. Moreover, targeted temperature management is linked to some adverse effects. The risk of infection and bleeding is moderately increased, as is the risk of hypokalemia and magnesemia. Circulation needs to be monitored invasively and any deviances corrected in a timely fashion. Outcome prediction in the individual patient is challenging, and a self-fulfilling prophecy poses a real threat to early prognostication based on clinical assessment alone. Therefore, delayed and multimodal prognostication is now considered a key element of postresuscitation care. Finally, modern postresuscitation care can produce good outcomes in the majority of patients but requires major diagnostic and therapeutic resources and specific training. Hence, recent international guidelines strongly recommend the implementation of regional prehospital resuscitation systems with integrated and specialized cardiac arrest centers.","Kirkegaard, Hans; Taccone, Fabio Silvio; Skrifvars, Markus; Søreide, Eldar",Anesthesiology,142,12

People often imagine how events might have turned out ""if only"" something had been different. The ""fault lines"" of reality, those aspects more readily changed, indicate that counterfactual thoughts are guided by the same principles as rational thoughts. In the past, rationality and imagination have been viewed as opposites. But research has shown that rational thought is more imaginative than cognitive scientists had supposed. In The Rational Imagination, I argue that imaginative thought is more rational than scientists have imagined. People exhibit remarkable similarities in the sorts of things they change in their mental representation of reality when they imagine how the facts could have turned out differently. For example, they tend to imagine alternatives to actions rather than inactions, events within their control rather than those beyond their control, and socially unacceptable events rather than acceptable ones. Their thoughts about how an event might have turned out differently lead them to judge that a strong causal relation exists between an antecedent event and the outcome, and their thoughts about how an event might have turned out the same lead them to judge that a weaker causal relation exists. In a simple temporal sequence, people tend to imagine alternatives to the most recent event. The central claim in the book is that counterfactual thoughts are organised along the same principles as rational thought. The idea that the counterfactual imagination is rational depends on three steps: (1) humans are capable of rational thought; (2) they make inferences by thinking about possibilities; and (3) their counterfactual thoughts rely on thinking about possibilities, just as rational thoughts do. The sorts of possibilities that people envisage explain the mutability of certain aspects of mental representations and the immutability of other aspects.","Byrne, Ruth M J",The Behavioral and brain sciences,142,19

This study investigated the effect of closed tracheal suctioning on aspiration of fluid past the tracheal tube cuff in an in vitro benchtop model. METHODS High-volume low pressure tube cuffs of 7.5 mm internal diameter (ID) were placed in a 22 mm ID artificial trachea connected to a test lung. Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) with 15 cm H₂O peak inspiratory pressure and 5 cm H₂O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was used. A closed tracheal suction system (CTSS) catheter (size 14Fr) was attached to the tracheal tube and suction was performed for 5, 10, 15, or 20 seconds under 200 or 300 cm H₂O suction pressures. Amount of fluid (mL) aspirated along the tube cuff and the airway pressure changes were recorded for each suction procedure. Fluid aspiration during different suction conditions was compared using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney test (Bonferroni correction [α = .01]). RESULTS During 10, 15, and 20 seconds suction, airway pressure consistently dropped down to -8 to -13 cm H₂O (P < .001) from the preset level. Fluid aspiration was never observed under PPV + PEEP but occurred always during suctioning. Aspiration along the tube cuff was higher with -300 cm H₂O than with -200 cm H₂O suction pressure (P < .001) and was much more during 15 and 20 seconds suction time as compared to 5 seconds (P < .001).

Despite sharing a similar etiology, COVID-19 patients present different patterns from asymptomatic to severely hypoxemic patients. In some patients, patterns of multiorgan failure have been observed similarly to patients with bacterial sepsis. This review aimed to analyze the currently available data on the treatment of COVID-19, specifically the most studied antiviral agents and therapies targeting the immune system including those that have been investigated in sepsis. RECENT FINDINGS In the last months, several trials have been conducted worldwide to try to identify optimal antiviral treatments against COVID-19. Antiviral agents such as lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine have been investigated as well as specific and non-specific immunomodulators in order to determine their potential efficacy against SARS-Cov2. SUMMARY To date, the vast majority of the studied antiviral and immunomodulatory agents have failed to improve outcomes of patients with COVID-19 except for dexamethasone.

However, the anxiety among students and faculty on university and college campuses, is undeniable. In-person instruction was haulted. Research labs and officeswere locked down or operating with limited personnel Thus, the challenges to have timely instruction and to move the research enterprise forward have been enormous. Provided here is a perspective gathered from a literature search using PubMed and google with search words ""COVID-19, stress, college students"", ""COVID-19, stress, US graduate students"", and ""COVID-19, stress, postdoc researchers"". RESULTS This article is an opinion piece, part personal and part peer experiences. It is presented in light of studies suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic has imposed significant mental stress and anxiety upon students and faculty members within the academy. CONCLUSION Loss of face-to-face interactions as a result of virtual instruction, lack of in-person mentoring, and loss of research productivity has taken its toll on the mental health and well- being of the academic community. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, the ingenuity of the human spirit has innovated solutions to catch up on research productivity and to pursue academic excellence.","Salim, Samina",Current neuropharmacology,142,17

Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is endorsed in the European guidelines of Urology as second-line therapy - on par with pharmacological treatment for women with OAB. METHODS This prospective cohort study describes our clinical experience with PTNS in a daily outpatient clinic, on a consecutive cohort. The cohort of 116 patients was mixed; including both men and women with idiopathic (iOAB) and neurogenic (nOAB) overactive bladder. Patients were treated with a 12-week course of PTNS followed by monthly maintenance treatment. Data were collected during 4 years. RESULTS The most common indication for PTNS was OAB with urge incontinence (53%) followed by OAB-dry and nocturia (both 16%). One hundred and ten (95%) patients completed follow-up and 68 patients (62%) continued to maintenance treatment. A total of 68 patients reported an effect on PROM, BD and ICIQ-OAB, which is the same 62% that continue in maintenance PTNS. A significant decline was seen in overall ICIQ-OAB score, with a median drop from 87 to 54, a significant decline in overall frequency and nocturia on bladder diary and a shift in pad test group in 19% of the incontinence patients. CONCLUSION PTNS shows an equally significant effect on men as well as women both in the iOAB and nOAB subgroups in a daily outpatient clinic. In our opinion, PTNS should be a standard treatment option available at urological departments, where both men and women in both sub-groups could benefit from treatment. Further randomized studies focusing on men with iOAB are needed.","Andersen, K; Kobberø, H; Pedersen, T B; Poulsen, M H",Scandinavian journal of urology,142,17

The relationships between virus infection and the mechanisms that moderate cytokine transcription are incompletely understood. We investigated the influence of Keap1 on cytokine gene induction by Sendai virus infection in mouse embryo fibroblasts. Virus infection induced Keap1 binding to the Ifnb1, Tnf, and Il6 genes. Keap1 moderated viral induction of their transcription by mechanisms that did not require Nrf2. Keap1 was required for NF-κB p50 recruitment, but not for NF-κB p65 or IRF3 recruitment, to these genes. Keap1 formed complexes with NF-κB p50 and NF-κB p65, which were visualized using bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis. These bimolecular fluorescence complementation complexes bound chromosomes in live cells, suggesting that Keap1 could bind chromatin in association with NF-κB proteins. Keap1 was required for viral induction of G9a-GLP lysine methyltransferase binding and H3K9me2 modification at cytokine genes. G9a-GLP inhibitors counteracted transcription repression by Keap1 and enhanced Keap1 and NF-κB recruitment to cytokine genes. The interrelationships among Keap1, NF-κB, and G9a-GLP recruitment, activities, and transcriptional effects suggest that they form a feedback circuit, which moderates viral induction of cytokine transcription. Nrf2 counteracted Keap1 binding to cytokine genes and the recruitment of NF-κB p50 and G9a-GLP by Keap1. Whereas Keap1 has been reported to influence cytokine expression indirectly through its functions in the cytoplasm, these findings provide evidence that Keap1 regulates cytokine transcription directly in the nucleus. Keap1 binds to cytokines genes upon virus infection and moderates their induction by recruiting NF-κB p50 and G9a-GLP.","Burns, Veronica Elizabeth; Kerppola, Tom Klaus",Journal of immunology,142,31

Otolaryngologists were actively involved in the management of the pandemic. In this work, we analyzed and compared the otolaryngology surgical activity performed during the pandemic in two large public hospitals located in different Italian regions. In northern Italy, otolaryngologists were mainly involved in performing surgical tracheotomies in COVID-19 positive patients and contributed to the management of these patients in intensive care units. In central Italy, where the burden of the infection was significantly lower, otolaryngologists focused on diagnosis and treatment of emergency and oncology patients. This analysis confirms the important role of the otolaryngology specialists during the pandemic, but also highlights specific differences between two large hospitals in different Italian regions.","Minni, Antonio; Pilolli, Francesco; Ralli, Massimo; Mevio, Niccolò; Roncoroni, Luca; Placentino, Angelo; Cialente, Fabrizio; Candelori, Francesca; Milani, Alessandro; de Vincentiis, Marco; Dragonetti, Alberto Giulio",Science progress,142,1

In this review, we discuss CRMs and their potential as cancer therapeutics. Firstly, we establish an overview of CR and its impacts on healthy and tumor cells. CR and CRM drugs have shown to decrease age-related diseases and can act as an anti-cancer agent. As it can be challenging for an individual to diligently stick to a diet that would induce CR, CRMs are even more desirable. Then we discuss the drug class by highlighting three CRMs; resveratrol, (-)-hydroxycitric acid and rapamycin. These CRMs are commonly known for their dietary effects, but the underlying mechanisms that drive cellular metabolic and proteomic changes show promise as a cancer therapeutic. Lastly, we highlight the use of mass spectrometry and proteomic techniques on experiments utilizing CRM drugs to understand the cellular pathways impacted by this drug class, leading to a better understanding of the anti-cancer properties and potentials of caloric restriction mimetics.

Given these problems can have significant impacts throughout the lifespan, preventing the negative repercussions of COVID-19 on children's mental health is essential. Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) show promise in this regard. OBJECTIVE The goal of the present study was to compare the impact of online MBI and a P4C interventions on mental health, within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a randomized cluster trial to assess and compare the impact of both interventions on elementary school students' (N = 37) anxiety and inattention symptoms as well as on their basic psychological need satisfaction (BPN). RESULTS ANCOVAs revealed a significant effect of the P4C intervention on mental health difficulties, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in the P4C group showed lower scores on the measured symptoms at post-test than participants in the MBI group. Significant effects of the MBI on levels of BPN were also found. Participants in the MBI intervention reported greater BPN satisfaction at post-test than participants in the P4C intervention. CONCLUSION Results from this study suggest that in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a P4C intervention centered around COVID-19 related themes may be helpful to reduce mental health difficulties, that a MBI may be useful to satisfy BPN, and that both interventions were easy to offer online to elementary school students. Future work including a larger sample size and follow-up measures is warranted. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE Practice: Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can be used to foster mental health in elementary school students, in the current COVID-19 context. Policy: As we do not anticipate that facilitators will be allowed in schools during the 2020-2021 school year and that children will, most likely, be attending school in the current COVID-19 context, policymakers who want to implement psychological support measures in elementary schools should consider an online modality, which has shown in this study to work well, be feasible, and yield positive results on youth mental health.","Malboeuf-Hurtubise, Catherine; Léger-Goodes, Terra; Mageau, Geneviève A; Joussemet, Mireille; Herba, Catherine; Chadi, Nicholas; Lefrançois, David; Camden, Chantal; Bussières, Ève-Line; Taylor, Geneviève; Éthier, Marc-André; Gagnon, Mathieu",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,142,25

This study aimed to investigate the role of dengue non-structural 1 (NS1) protein and host factors contributing to severe dengue. Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing system was used to investigate the changes in barrier function of microvascular endothelial cells treated NS1 protein and serum samples from patients with different disease severity. Cytokines and metabolites profiles were assessed using a multiplex cytokine assay and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry respectively. The findings showed that NS1 was able to induce the loss of barrier function in microvascular endothelium in a dose dependent manner, however, the level of NS1 in serum samples did not correlate with the extent of vascular leakage induced. Further assessment of host factors revealed that cytokines such as CCL2, CCL5, CCL20 and CXCL1, as well as adhesion molecule ICAM-1, that are involved in leukocytes infiltration were expressed higher in dengue patients in comparison to healthy individuals. In addition, metabolomics study revealed the presence of deregulated metabolites involved in the phospholipid metabolism pathway in patients with severe manifestations. In conclusion, disease severity in dengue virus infection did not correlate directly with NS1 level, but instead with host factors that are involved in the regulation of junctional integrity and phospholipid metabolism. However, as the studied population was relatively small in this study, these exploratory findings should be confirmed by expanding the sample size using an independent cohort to further establish the significance of this study.","Soe, Hui Jen; Manikam, Rishya; Raju, Chandramathi Samudi; Khan, Mohammad Asif; Sekaran, Shamala Devi",PloS one,142,1

These negative side effects have a crucial impact on their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). To date, there is evidence that rehabilitation interventions such as physical activity and psychosocial support have a positive effect on the HRQoL of cancer survivors. Unfortunately, there are no specific guidelines for rehabilitation or survivorship programmes for MIBC survivors. Therefore, this systematic review aims to assess the effects of exercise-based and psychosocial rehabilitation interventions in MIBC survivors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The approach of this review is consistent with the Cochrane methodology. Randomized controlled trials and non-randomised studies will be included. The population of interest is patients (≥18 years of age) with diagnosis of MIBC or high-risk non-MIBC for whom a radical cystectomy is indicated. There will be two eligible intervention types for inclusion: exercise-based and psychosocial rehabilitation interventions. The primary outcome measures are patient-reported outcomes (eg, HRQoL, fatigue and pain) and physical fitness. Studies will be identified independently by two review authors by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database. A third reviewer will be asked by disagreements. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data will be summarised descriptively. If homogeneity of the studies is sufficient, meta-analysis will be undertaken. The broad scope of this review (ie, different interventions and study designs) is needed to have a comprehensive view on effective rehabilitation interventions. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not required, as no primary data will be collected. Results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication.","Rammant, Elke; Bultijnck, Renée; Sundahl, Nora; Ost, Piet; Pauwels, Nele S; Deforche, Benedicte; Pieters, Ronny; Decaestecker, Karel; Fonteyne, Valérie",BMJ open,142,20

Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear how hospitals in the federal states of Berlin and Brandenburg are structured with regard to structural adaptions, personnel situations, protective equipment and trainings. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate and compare the current status of all hospitals in both states. Methods: In April 2020, an online survey of all hospitals in Berlin and Brandenburg (n = 99) was carried out. Structural capacities, the personnel situation, protective equipment and training were investigated. Results: The hospitals (response rate: 31.3 %) have made all structural changes except for n = 1 facility. The majority of the failure rate is critically stated as 5 - 10 % before (58.6 %) and during the pandemic (51.5 %). The proportion with > 10 % default rate increases from 20.7 % to 31.0 %. 45.2 % of hospitals report that they rarely have shortage in protective clothing. Nurses at peripheral wards are often trained in handling with respiratory patients. The duration is in median 2 - 8 hours. No significant differences between Berlin and Brandenburg were found. Conclusions: At the time of the survey, the hospitals in Berlin and Brandenburg were well prepared for the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, the results indicate that hospitals are well prepared to ensure the health care provision.","Gräske, Johannes; Lengert-Brzozowski, Sandra; Neumann, Fränze; Görsch, Luisa; Biniok, Maria; Koppe, Louise",Pflege,142,16

Namely, vitamin D supplementation appeared to improve viral RTIs across cohorts particulate in those with vitamin D deficiency. Among the evaluated dietary supplements, specific lactobacillus strains were used most commonly with select prebiotics that showed potentially positive effects on the prevention and treatment of viral RTIs. Further, ginseng extract supplementation may effectively prevent viral RTIs as adjuvant therapy.

ST-4 is a TCR-enhanced mutant derived from superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 (SEC2), which can hyperactivate CD4+ T cells without MHC class II molecules. However, whether ST-4/SEC2 can enhance metabolic reprogramming in CD8+ T cells remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that ST-4, but not SEC2, could induce proliferation of purified CD8+ T cell from BALB/c mice in Vβ8.2- and -8.3-specific manners. Results of gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis showed that fatty acid contents in CD8+ T cells were increased after ST-4 stimulation. Flow cytometry and Seahorse analyses showed that ST-4 significantly promoted mitochondrial energy metabolism in CD8+ T cells. We also observed significantly upregulated levels of gene transcripts for fatty acid uptake and synthesis, and significantly increased protein expression levels of fatty acid and mitochondrial metabolic markers of mTOR/PPARγ/SREBP1 and p38-MAPK signaling pathways in ST-4-activated CD8+ T cells. However, blocking mTOR, PPARγ, SREBP1, or p38-MAPK signals with specific inhibitors could significantly relieve the enhanced fatty acid catabolism and mitochondrial capacity induced by ST-4. In addition, blocking these signals inhibited ST-4-stimulated CD8+ T cell proliferation and effector functions. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that ST-4 enhanced fatty acid and mitochondria metabolic reprogramming through mTOR/PPARγ/SREBP and p38-MAPK signaling pathways, which may be important regulatory mechanisms of CD8+ T cell activation. Understanding the effects of ST-4-induced regulatory metabolic networks on CD8+ T cells provide important mechanistic insights to superantigen-based tumor therapy.","Fu, Xuanhe; Xu, Mingkai; Zhang, Huiwen; Li, Yongqiang; Li, Yansheng; Zhang, Chenggang",Journal of immunology,142,5

This raises a question as to the reasons for this underpreparedness. While preparedness should have better reflected pandemics' long-run inevitability and potentially catastrophic impact, government-planning horizons are short term, and the attentiveness of policymakers is bounded and subject to multiple demands. Preparedness is therefore affected by the fundamental uncertainty surrounding the exact nature, timing, and impact of a pandemic. While a subjective probability is attributable to such an event's occurrence, just like it is any other, if founded on scant knowledge and perceived as being low it may inhibit preparedness. Under such circumstances, preparedness may be better served by a focus on plausibility. Moreover, any tendency for policymakers to disregard highly uncertain, low-probability, yet highly impactful events of this type is exacerbated by their ""fat-tailed"" distribution, which obscures their potential extremity. This article considers how plausibility-based scenario planning can increase preparedness for extreme events like a global pandemic, thereby reducing overconfidence in continued business-as-usual in their face, and emphasizing precaution in their wake. In so doing, the article contributes to what in this journal has recently been called ""type B,"" ""generic and fundamental"" risk science, which is concerned with identifying better ways to present and communicate uncertainties. In focusing on plausibility-based scenario planning, the article highlights a method seldom previously discussed in relation to risk science, yet one that can contribute much to this type B component of it.","Derbyshire, James",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,142,1

METHODS This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed on twenty-five patients with non-healing DFU. Patients were treated with PRP-FG dressing plus oral vitamin E and C (intervention group) or PRP-FG dressing plus placebo (control group) for eight weeks. RESULTS Eight weeks after treatment, six wounds in the intervention group and two wounds in the control group were completely closed, and also wound size significantly reduced in both intervention (-9.7 ± 6.9 cm2, p = 0.002), and control (-5.6 ± 5.4 cm2, p = 0.003) groups. This reduction in wound size was significantly greater in the intervention group compared to the control group (p = 0.019). Also, a significant decrease in prooxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB) index, ESR, and hs-CRP were observed in the intervention group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Results of this trial showed that PRP-FG dressing along with oral vitamin E and C could be used to increase wound healing in patients with non-healing DFU by enhancing the wound healing process and reducing oxidative stress.

METHODS A prospective, observational, non-randomized cohort trial was performed comparing 25 consecutive patients who underwent PUG placement between April 2020 and August 2020 with 25 consecutive patients who underwent PRG placement between February 2020 and March 2020. Procedure time, sedation, analgesia requirements, and complications were compared between the two groups in non-inferiority analysis. RESULTS Technical success rates were 96% in both groups (24/25) of procedures. Ninety-two percent of patients in the PUG cohort were admitted to the ICU at the time of G-tube request. Aside from significantly more COVID-19 patients in the PUG group (P < .001), there was no other statistically significant difference in patient demographics. Intra-procedure pain medication requirements were the same for both groups, 50 micrograms of IV fentanyl (P = 1.0). Intra-procedure sedation with IV midazolam was insignificantly higher in the PUG group 1.12 mg vs 0.8 mg (P = .355). Procedure time trended toward statistical significance (P = .076), with PRG being shorter than PUG (30.5 ± 14.1 minutes vs 39.7 ± 17.9 minutes). There were 2 non-device related major complications in the PUG group and 1 major and 1 minor complication in the PRG group. CONCLUSION PUG is similar in terms of complications to PRG gastrostomy tube placement and a safe method for gastrostomy tube placement in the critically ill with the added benefits of bedside placement, elimination of radiation exposure, and expanded and improved access to care.","Reis, Stephen P; Brejt, Sidney Z; Weintraub, Joseph R; Ahmad, Noor; Susman, Jonathan; Mobley, David G",Journal of intensive care medicine,142,27

We investigated the association of pre-existing medical conditions and self-perceived health status with the risk of mental health complications during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS In October-December, 2020, 1036 respondents completed online survey that included assessment of pre-existing conditions, self-perceived health status, depressive (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 score ≥ 10), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorders-7 score ≥ 10) and post-traumatic stress (Impact of Events Scale Revised) symptoms, alcohol use (AUDIT), and COVID-19 fear (COVID-19 Fears Questionnaires for Chronic Medical Conditions). RESULTS Study participants were predominantly women (83%), younger than 61 years of age (94%). Thirty-six percent of respondents had a pre-existing condition and 5% considered their health status as bad or very bad. Pre-existing conditions and poor perceived health status were associated with increased risk for moderate to severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, fear of COVID-19 and post-traumatic stress symptoms, independently from respondents' age, gender, living area, smoking status, exercise, alcohol consumption and diet. CONCLUSIONS Pre-existing medical conditions and poor perceived health status are associated with increased risk of poor mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Buneviciene, Inesa; Bunevicius, Romas; Bagdonas, Sarunas; Bunevicius, Adomas",Journal of public health,142,1

Two manifold learning methods, isometric feature mapping and locally linear embedding, are applied to the analysis of reaction trajectories, which are calculated by the quasi-classical trajectory approach on a newly developed accurate quartet state NH3+(4A) potential energy surface for a multichannel reaction NH+ + H2 → N + H3+/NH2+ + H. The results show that isometric feature mapping can clearly identify different reaction paths from the reactive trajectories, and the locally linear embedding is better for the classification of non-reactive trajectories, and both of them facilitate quantitative analysis. With the help of trajectory analysis, the competition between the two H-atom abstraction reactions can be attributed to two different capture paths.","Shi, Weiliang; Jia, Tian; Li, Anyang",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,142,31

Recent studies have highlighted the role of mechanical signals in mammalian dermal wound healing. However, the biological link between mechanical stimulation of wounded tissue and the subsequent cellular response has not been fully determined. The capacity for researchers to study this link is partially limited by the lack of instrumentation capable of applying controlled mechanical stimuli to wounded tissue. The studies outlined here tested the hypothesis that it was possible to control the magnitude of induced wound tissue deformation using a microfabricated dressing composed of an array of open-faced, hexagonally shaped microchambers rendered in a patch of silicone rubber. By connecting the dressing to a single vacuum source, the underlying wounded tissue was drawn up into each of the microchambers, thereby inducing tissue deformation. For these studies, the dressings were applied to full-thickness murine dermal wounds with 200 mmHg vacuum for 12 h. These studies demonstrated that the dressing was capable of inducing wound tissue deformation with values ranging from 11 to 29%. Through statistical analysis, the magnitude of the induced deformation was shown to be a function of both microchamber height and width. These results demonstrated that the dressing was capable of controlling the amount of deformation imparted in the underlying tissue. By allowing the application of mechanical stimulation with varying intensities, such a dressing will enable the performance of sophisticated mechanobiology studies in dermal wound healing.","Kane, Bartholomew J; Younan, George; Helm, Douglas; Dastouri, Pouya; Prentice-Mott, Harrison; Irimia, Daniel; Chan, Rodney K; Toner, Mehmet; Orgill, Dennis P",Journal of biomedical materials research.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with retroperitoneal metastatic disease due to gynecologic malignancies were evaluated for imaging-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation in this study. Efficacy of treatment was assessed by post-radiofrequency ablation activity on PET/CT scans. RESULTS Eight patients were considered for imaging-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of retroperitoneal metastatic disease. Radiofrequency ablation was successfully completed in five patients with six metastatic tumors. All procedures were performed with the use of hydrodissection as an adjunct maneuver to displace adjacent structures. All patients showed absence of FDG activity on post-radiofrequency ablation PET/CT scans. Three (60%) of the five patients showed absence of FDG activity of the treated disease at 23.5 months after radiofrequency ablation.

A retrospective review of 378 consecutive laparoendoscopic single-site(LESS) donor nephrectomies performed between 04/15/2009 and 04/09/2014 was conducted. Twelve patients (3%) developed an umbilical hernia. Eleven (92%) were female and eight (73%) of these patients had a prior pregnancy. Hernias were reported 13.5 ± 6.9 months after donation, and the mean size was 5.1 ± 3.7 cm. Seven additional cases (1.9%) required a return to the operating room for internal hernia (2), evisceration (1), bleeding (1), enterotomy (1), and wound infection (2). The original incision was utilized for reexploration. One patient required emergent conversion to an open procedure for bleeding during the initial donation. There were no mortalities.

Methods: Secondary analysis of an RCT including 170 adults meeting DSM-IV criteria for OUD. Participants were randomized to 12-weeks of treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU plus a digital therapeutic providing 67 digital, interactive educational modules based on the Community Reinforcement Approach. TAU consisted of buprenorphine maintenance therapy, 30 minutes biweekly clinician interaction, and abstinence-based contingency management. Primary endpoints were treatment retention and abstinence (negative urine drug screen) during weeks 9-12 of treatment. Safety was assessed by evaluating adverse events. Results: Participants randomized to TAU plus a digital therapeutic had significantly greater odds of opioid abstinence during weeks 9-12 compared to TAU: 77.3% versus 62.1% respectively (P = 0.02), OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.10-3.95. The risk of patients leaving treatment was significantly lower in the digital therapeutic group (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26-0.92).

Despite correlations between outcomes, expertise and advanced cognitive skills, current methods to evaluate these skills remain subjective, rater- and situation-dependent and non-systematic. The purpose of this study was to develop objective metrics using a Web-based platform and to obtain validity evidence for their assessment of decision-making during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS An interactive online learning platform was developed ( www.thinklikeasurgeon.com ). Trainees and surgeons from six institutions completed a 12-item assessment, developed based on a cognitive task analysis. Five items required subjects to draw their answer on the surgical field, and accuracy scores were calculated based on an algorithm derived from experts' responses (""visual concordance test"", VCT). Test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and correlation with self-reported experience, Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS) score and Objective Performance Rating Scale (OPRS) score were calculated. Questionnaires were administered to evaluate the platform's usability, feasibility and educational value. RESULTS Thirty-nine subjects (17 surgeons, 22 trainees) participated. There was high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.95; n = 10) and internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.87). The assessment demonstrated significant differences between novices, intermediates and experts in total score (p < 0.01) and VCT score (p < 0.01). There was high correlation between total case number and total score (ρ = 0.83, p < 0.01) and between total case number and VCT (ρ = 0.82, p < 0.01), and moderate to high correlations between total score and GOALS (ρ = 0.66, p = 0.05), VCT and GOALS (ρ = 0.83, p < 0.01), total score and OPRS (ρ = 0.67, p = 0.04), and VCT and OPRS (ρ = 0.78, p = 0.01). Most subjects agreed or strongly agreed that the platform and assessment was easy to use [n = 29 (78 %)], facilitates learning intra-operative decision-making [n = 28 (81 %)], and should be integrated into surgical training [n = 28 (76 %)].

METHODS Between February 2011 and June 2012, 57 patients underwent LGGCP. Thirteen had it associated with a lap band and were excluded from the study. Data was collected through routine follow-up. Demographics, complications, and percentage of excess weight loss (% EWL) were determined. RESULTS Forty-four patients underwent LGGCP, 40 women and 4 men with a mean age of 40 years (range, 18-72), a mean body mass index of 38 kg/m(2) (range, 35-46). Comorbidities included 2 diabetes mellitus, 11 hypertension, 8 hyperlipidaemia, and 8 obstructive sleep apnea. The mean operative time was 106 min (range, 60-180) and mean duration of hospital stay was 18 h (range, 12-168). Operative complications included one subphrenic abscess, one gastrogastric hernia, and one acute respiratory distress syndrome. Thirty patients experienced strong restriction with nausea and vomiting for the first 10 days (79.5 %). Eleven patients (25.0 %) came back with intractable nausea and vomiting, and were hospitalized, or had their hospital stay prolonged. Four patients needed early reversal of gastric plication (9 %). There was no postoperative death. The mean postoperative % EWL was 30.6 % (n = 40), 57.0 % (n = 24), 50.7 % (n = 13) at 1, 6, and 12 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS LGGCP yields an acceptable weight loss compared to other restrictive procedures, but with a higher readmission rate for postoperative nausea and vomiting, or even reversal of plication.

To understand the response of macrophages, they are often cultured in vitro on biomaterials. Since a wide range of biomaterials is currently used in the clinics, we undertook a systematic review of the macrophage polarization in response to these different surgical biomaterials in vitro. Beside the chemistry, material characteristics such as dimension, pore size, and surface topography are of great influence on the response of macrophages. The macrophage response also appears to depend on the differences in sterilization techniques that induce lasting biochemical changes or residues of chemicals and their byproducts used for sterilization. Regarding tissue-based biomaterials, macrophages on human or porcine dermis, strongly cross-linked by chemicals elicit in general a proinflammatory response with higher amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. Synthetic biomaterials such as polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) + polyacrylamide (PAAm), PET + sodium salt of poly(acrylic acid) (PAANa), perfluoropolyether (PFPE) with large posts, PEG-g-PA, and polydioxanone (PDO) always appear to elicit an anti-inflammatory response in macrophages, irrespective of origin of the macrophages, for example, buffy coats or full blood. In conclusion, in general in vitro models contribute to evaluate the foreign body reaction on surgical biomaterials. Although it is difficult to simulate complexity of host response elicited by biomaterials, after their surgical implantation, an in vitro model gives indications of the initial foreign body response and allows the comparison of this response between biomaterials.","Boersema, Geesien S A; Grotenhuis, Nienke; Bayon, Yves; Lange, Johan F; Bastiaansen-Jenniskens, Yvonne M",BioResearch open access,142,29

Therefore, we hypothesized that αs1- and β-CN have strong cross-reactivity among CN components, despite the low similarity in the full-length amino acid sequences. METHODS The αs1-, β-, and κ-CN were purified from commercial cow's milk. We recruited 39 patients with cow's milk allergy and the serum IgE levels for each CN component were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cross-reactivity between CN components was investigated by competitive ELISA against αs1-CN. Sequence homology between CN components at the peptide level was calculated using in silico analysis and quantified by the Property Distance (PD) value. RESULTS The αs1-CN-specific IgE levels exhibited a strong positive correlation with the β-CN-specific IgE (r = 0.945, P < 0.001). Complete competition was observed by β-CN against αs1-CN, suggesting the presence of common epitopes between them. In silico analysis detected 24 peptide sets with PD values lower than 10 between αs1- and β-CN, and 14 sets between αs1- and κ-CN. The amino acid sequences of αs1- (E61-E70) and β-CN (I12-E21) that showed the lowest PD value (5.30) were present in the characteristic sequence known as casein phosphopeptide (CPP).

Therefore, it is essential to implement evidence-based strategies for preventing these readmissions. The primary objective of our systematic review was to identify and describe the domains of existing primary research on strategies aimed at reducing hospital readmissions among adult patients with COPD. We also aimed to identify existing gaps in the literature to facilitate future research efforts. A total of 843 studies were captured by the initial search and 96 were included in the final review (25 randomized controlled trials, 37 observational studies, and 34 non-randomized interventional studies). Of the included studies, 72% (n = 69) were considered low risk of bias. The majority of included studies (n = 76) evaluated patient-level readmission prevention strategies (medication and other treatments (n = 25), multi-modal (n = 19), follow-up (n = 16), telehealth (n = 8), education and coaching (n = 8)). Fewer assessed broader system- (n = 13) and policy-level (n = 7) strategies. We observed a trend toward reduced all-cause readmissions with the use of medication and other treatments, as well as a trend toward reduced COPD-related readmissions with the use of multi-modal and broader scale system-level interventions. Notably, much of this evidence supported shorter-term (30-day) readmission outcomes, while little evidence was available for longer-term outcomes. These findings should be interpreted with caution, as considerable between-study heterogeneity was also identified. Overall, this review identified several evidence-based interventions for reducing readmissions among patients with COPD that should be targeted for future research.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/15412555.2021.1955338 .","Sharpe, Isobel; Bowman, Meghan; Kim, Andrew; Srivastava, Siddhartha; Jalink, Matthew; Wijeratne, Don Thiwanka",COPD,142,11

METHODS A sample of 4668 observations (patient year) of 1350 haemodialysis with hypertension (HH) patients and 4668 observations of 1436 non-HH (NHH) patients were drawn from the National Health Insurance Research Database over the years from 1999 to 2005. The impact of ODGB on hypertension-related outpatient utilization of HH was estimated using the difference in difference (DID) method and examined in three stages: (1) the fee for service stage, the pre-ODGB (2000), (2) the phase-in stage (2001-2002) and (3) the post-ODGB stage (2003-2005). RESULTS ODGB implementation did not affect the number of dialysis visits for HH patients. However, it did lead to a reduction in fees for antihypertension drugs used by haemodialysis facilities. There was an increase of 4.06 visits per patient per year (P < 0.001) in the number of non-dialysis outpatient with antihypertensive drugs visits for HH patients compared with the control group. The total fees for antihypertensive drugs for HH patients increased by New Taiwan Dollars (NT$)13 008 (P < 0.001) per patient per year relative to the control group after the implementation of ODGB. CONCLUSIONS As ODGB was implemented, HH patients received fewer antihypertensive drugs during their dialysis visit. In addition, there was an increase in the number of non-dialysis outpatient visits by HH patients as well as increased payment in the drugs associated with their non-dialysis outpatient visits compared with the control group.","Chang, Ray-E; Tsai, Ya-Hsing; Myrtle, Robert C",Health policy and planning,142,31

There is, however, no consensus on how to define success for such initiatives. This scoping review aims to identify the key elements for defining the quality of patient and family caregiver engagement in decision-making across the engagement domains (individual, community/organisation, system) of British Columbia's healthcare system. We will use those elements to develop a conceptual evaluation framework. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This scoping review follows Arskey and O'Malley's methodology. (1) The research question was identified through team discussions. (2) Articles for data source will be identified using a librarian-informed search strategy for seven bibliographic databases as well as grey literature sources. (3) Selected articles will be relevant to the evaluation of patient and family caregiver engagement in healthcare systems. (4) Two researchers will independently extract data into predefined and emerging categories. (5) The researchers will reconcile and organise the identified elements. The research team's collective perspective will then refine the elements, and select, interpret and summarise the results. (6) Persons from key stakeholder groups will be consulted to refine the emergent conceptual framework. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION We will seek ethics approval for the stakeholder consultation. This study follows an integrated knowledge translation approach. The results will inform evaluation of the Patients as Partners Initiative of the British Columbia Ministry of Health, and will be disseminated as a scientific article, a research brief, and presentations at conferences and stakeholder meetings.","Hamilton, Clayon; Snow, M Elizabeth; Clark, Nancy; Gibson, Shannon; Dehnadi, Maryam; Lui, Michelle; Koster, Andrew; McLean, Janet; Li, Linda C",BMJ open,142,17

SETTING The HIV outpatient clinic of the Infectious Diseases Department of Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy, which serves more than 5000 PLWH per year. METHODS A before and after quasi-experimental study design was used to make a retrospective assessment of the monthly trend of HIV-RNA determinations of ≥50 among the PLWH attending our clinic, with ""before"" being the period from January 1, 2016 to February 20, 2020, and ""after"" being the period from February 21, 2020 to December 31, 2020 (the COVID-19 period). Interrupted time series analysis was used to evaluate any changes in the trend. RESULTS During the study period, 70,349 HIV-RNA viral load determinations were made, and the percentage of HIV-RNA viral load determinations of <50 copies/mL increased from 88.4% in 2016 to 93.2% in 2020 (P < 0.0001). There was a significant monthly trend toward a decrease in the number of HIV-RNA determinations of ≥50 copies/mL before the pandemic (β -0.084; standard error 0.015; P < 0.001), and this did not significantly change after it started (β -0.039, standard error 0.161; P = 0.811). CONCLUSIONS A high prevalence of viral suppression was maintained among the PLWH referring to our clinic, despite the structural barriers raised by the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of simplified methods of delivering care (such as teleconsultations and multiple antiretroviral treatment prescriptions) may have contributed to preserving this continuum.","Giacomelli, Andrea; Bonazzetti, Cecilia; Conti, Federico; Pezzati, Laura; Oreni, Letizia; Micheli, Valeria; Mancon, Alessandro; Vimercati, Stefania; Albrecht, Maria; Passerini, Matteo; Cossu, Maria Vittoria; Capetti, Amedeo Ferdinando; Meraviglia, Paola; Antinori, Spinello; Rizzardini, Giuliano; Galli, Massimo; Ridolfo, Anna Lisa",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,142,1

A total of 15 pigs were subjected to laparoscopic-assisted cryoablation on both kidneys. After intervention, each animal was randomized to a postoperative follow-up period of 1, 2, or 4 weeks, after which computed tomography perfusion and magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed. Immediately after imaging, open bilateral nephrectomy was performed allowing for histopathological examination of the cryolesions. On computed tomography perfusion and magnetic resonance imaging examinations, rim enhancement was observed in the transition zone of the cryolesion 1week after laparoscopic-assisted cryoablation. This rim enhancement was found to subside after 2 and 4 weeks of follow-up, which was consistent with the microscopic examinations revealing of fibrotic scar tissue formation in the peripheral zone of the cryolesion. On T2 magnetic resonance imaging sequences, a thin hypointense rim surrounded the cryolesion, separating it from the adjacent renal parenchyma. Microscopic examinations revealed hemorrhage and later hemosiderin located in the peripheral zone. No nodular or diffuse contrast enhancement was found in the central zone of the cryolesions at any follow-up stage on neither computed tomography perfusion nor magnetic resonance imaging. On microscopic examinations, the central zone was found to consist of coagulative necrosis 1 week after laparoscopic-assisted cryoablation, which was partially replaced by fibrotic scar tissue 4 weeks following laparoscopic-assisted cryoablation. Both computed tomography perfusion and magnetic resonance imaging found the renal collecting system to be involved at all 3 stages of follow-up, but on microscopic examination, the urothelium was found to be intact in all cases. In conclusion, cryoablation effectively destroyed renal parenchyma, leaving the urothelium intact. Both computed tomography perfusion and magnetic resonance imaging reflect the microscopic findings but with some differences, especially regarding the peripheral zone. Magnetic resonance imaging seems an attractive modality for early postoperative follow-up.","Nielsen, Tommy Kjærgaard; Østraat, Øyvind; Graumann, Ole; Pedersen, Bodil Ginnerup; Andersen, Gratien; Høyer, Søren; Borre, Michael",Technology in cancer research & treatment,142,19

With the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the use of chlorine disinfection has increased, raising the already substantial risks of DBP exposure. While a number of methods are able to remove TCAA, their application for continuous treatment is limited due to their complexity and expensive or hazardous inputs. We investigated a novel system that employs palladium (Pd0) nanoparticles (PdNPs) for catalytic reductive dechlorination of TCAA. H2 was delivered directly to PdNPs in situ coated on the surface of bubble-free hollow-fiber gas-transfer membranes. The H2-based membrane Pd film reactor (H2-MPfR) achieved a high catalyst-specific TCAA reduction rate, 32 L/g-Pd/min, a value similar to the rate of using homogeneously suspended PdNP, but orders of magnitude higher than with other immobilized PdNP systems. In batch tests, over 99% removal of 1 mM TCAA was achieved in 180 min with strong product selectivity (≥ 93%) to acetic acid. During 50 days of continuous operation, over 99% of 1 mg/L influent TCAA was removed, again with acetic acid as the major product (≥ 94%). We identified the reaction pathways and their kinetics for TCAA reductive dechlorination with PdNPs using direct delivery of H2. Sustained continuous TCAA removal, high selectivity to acetic acid, and minimal loss of PdNPs support that the H2-MPfR is a promising catalytic reactor to remove chlorinated DBPs in practice.","Cai, Yuhang; Long, Xiangxing; Luo, Yi-Hao; Zhou, Chen; Rittmann, Bruce E",Water research,142,31

Early warning and forecasting are one of the most cost-effective ways for HFMD control and prevention. However, relevant research is limited, especially in China with a large population and diverse climatic characteristics. This study aims to identify local specific HFMD epidemic thresholds and construct a weather-based early warning model for HFMD control and prevention across China. METHODS Monthly notified HFMD cases and meteorological data for 22 cities selected from different climate zones from 2014 to 2018 were extracted from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System and the Meteorological Data Sharing Service System, respectively. A generalized additive model (GAM) based on meteorological factors was conducted to forecast HFMD epidemics. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) was generated to determine the value of optimal warning threshold. RESULTS The developed model was solid in forecasting the epidemic of HFMD with all R square (R2) in the 22 cities above 85%, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) less than 1%. The warning thresholds varied by cities with the highest threshold observed in Shenzhen (n=7,195) and the lowest threshold in Liaoyang (n=12). The areas under the curve (AUC) was greater than 0.9 for all regions, indicating a satisfied discriminating ability in epidemics detection. CONCLUSIONS The weather-based HFMD forecasting and early warning model we developed for different climate zones provides needed information on occurrence time and size of HFMD epidemics. An effective early warning system for HFMD could provide sufficient time for local authorities to implement timely interventions to minimize the HFMD morbidity and mortality.","Gao, Qi; Liu, Zhidong; Xiang, Jianjun; Tong, Michael; Zhang, Ying; Wang, Shuzi; Zhang, Yiwen; Lu, Liang; Jiang, Baofa; Bi, Peng",Environmental research,142,1

Objective To evaluate early surgical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in different subspecialties. Design, Setting, and Participants This matched cohort study conducted in the general, vascular and thoracic surgery, orthopedic, and neurosurgery units of Spedali Civili Hospital (Brescia, Italy) included patients who underwent surgical treatment from February 23 to April 1, 2020, and had positive test results for COVID-19 either before or within 1 week after surgery. Gynecological and minor surgical procedures were excluded. Patients with COVID-19 were matched with patients without COVID-19 with a 1:2 ratio for sex, age group, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and comorbidities recorded in the surgical risk calculator of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Patients older than 65 years were also matched for the Clinical Frailty Scale score. Exposures Patients with positive results for COVID-19 and undergoing surgery vs matched surgical patients without infection. Screening for COVID-19 was performed with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay in nasopharyngeal swabs, chest radiography, and/or computed tomography. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on positivity of at least 1 of these investigations. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was early surgical mortality and complications in patients with COVID-19; secondary end points were the modeling of complications to determine the importance of COVID-19 compared with other surgical risk factors. Results Of 41 patients (of 333 who underwent operation during the same period) who underwent mainly urgent surgery, 33 (80.5%) had positive results for COVID-19 preoperatively and 8 (19.5%) had positive results within 5 days from surgery. Of the 123 patients of the combined cohorts (78 women [63.4%]; mean [SD] age, 76.6 [14.4] years), 30-day mortality was significantly higher for those with COVID-19 compared with control patients without COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 9.5; 95% CI, 1.77-96.53). Complications were also significantly higher (OR, 4.98; 95% CI, 1.81-16.07); pulmonary complications were the most common (OR, 35.62; 95% CI, 9.34-205.55), but thrombotic complications were also significantly associated with COVID-19 (OR, 13.2; 95% CI, 1.48-∞). Different models (cumulative link model and classification tree) identified COVID-19 as the main variable associated with complications. Conclusions and Relevance In this matched cohort study, surgical mortality and complications were higher in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients without COVID-19.

We assessed the safety and efficacy of combined mogamulizumab (anti-CCR4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-programmed death-1 [PD-1] antibody) in immunotherapy-naive patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN This study (NCT02476123) comprised dose-escalation (3+3 design) and expansion parts. Patients received nivolumab (3.0 mg/kg) every 2 weeks, with mogamulizumab (0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg in dose-escalation, 1.0 mg/kg in expansion) once weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks, until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary objective was safety; secondary objectives were antitumor effects, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. Exploratory biomarker analyses were conducted. RESULTS 96 patients were enrolled (July 2015-November 2016): six patients in the dose-escalation part and 90 in the expansion part. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in the dose-escalation part. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 29% of patients in the expansion part (no grade 5 TRAEs). The most frequent TRAEs were rash (39%), rash maculo-papular (20%), diarrhea (13%), stomatitis (12%), and pruritus (11%). There were four (27%) confirmed tumor responses among 15 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and one confirmed and two unconfirmed responses among 15 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. During treatment, populations of effector Tregs (CD4+CD45RA-FoxP3high) decreased and CD8+ T-cells in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes increased. CONCLUSIONS Combining an anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab, with a Treg-depleting anti-CCR4 antibody, mogamulizumab, provides an acceptable safety profile, antitumor activity, and a potentially effective option in cancer immunotherapy.","Doi, Toshihiko; Muro, Kei; Ishii, Hiroshi; Kato, Terufumi; Tsushima, Takahiro; Takenoyama, Mitsuhiro; Oizumi, Satoshi; Gemmoto, Kazuto; Suna, Hideaki; Enokitani, Kouki; Kawakami, Tetsuyoshi; Nishikawa, Hiroyoshi; Yamamoto, Noboru",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,142,16

As COVID-19 rapidly overwhelmed the healthcare system in 2020, oncology departments found that space, staff, and funds were reallocated to address patient needs during the pandemic. Traditional outpatient services were required to operate with reduced resources, with special attention to additional measures to protect workers and patients from exposure to the virus. Little is known about how these changes affected the nature of the practice of oncology social work. Methods: We compared data on OSW interventions for three months (March-May) 2019 to the same period in 2020. Mount Sinai Downtown Cancer Center's Department of Social Work routinely collects data on services provided by social workers using a validated instrument. As NYC became the epicenter of the COVID-19 in March 2020, the comparison of these time periods creates a natural experiment to examine whether and how the presence of the virus impacted the services provided by OSWs. Findings: There was little difference in the number of encounters that took place between the two time periods (2186 encounters in 2019 and 2084 encounters in 2020); however, there were notable differences in the types of interventions. While interventions involving supportive counseling decreased in 2020, we identified a significant increase specific to bereavement counseling. Conclusion: The study shows a remarkable consistency in the volume and types of services provided by OSWs, in spite of the radical increase in stressors they experienced during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that the OSWs did not allow these stressors to interfere with their work with patients. This study demonstrates how routine use of an instrument to measure OSW interventions can be used to examine services provided over time and to evaluate potential influences of external factors.","Snow, Alison; Handsman, Sarah; Lawton, Brittany; Burruss, Karen; Oktay, Julianne S",Journal of psychosocial oncology,142,20

However, literature on the HIT products is largely for outpatients and little is known about those for hospitalized patients. In 2014, a Korean hospital developed an inpatient portal known as the Smart Bedside Station (SBS). A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the associated factors for accessing the medication view menu (Today's Medication) on the SBS using data from October 2018 through September 2019. A root cause analysis with expert review was conducted to identify additional barriers for accessing the medication view menu. Approximately 92.58% of the study population accessed the SBS at least once during their hospital stay. However, 99.20% of accessed patients used the SBS for entertainment purposes (e.g., television) and 40.16% viewed the medication information. Younger age, higher education, and certain jobs were significant associated factors for accessing the medication information. In conclusion, this study revealed strong associations between accessing the medication view menu on the SBS and a number of associated factors. Based on the results, further research is warranted to suggest new items to access the medication view menu by hospitalized patients.","Cho, Jungwon; Kim, Seungyeon; Shin, Sangyoon; Yoo, Hyejin; Park, Gi Hyue; Jeon, Eunha; Lee, Eunsook; Lee, Ho-Young; Lee, Euni",International journal of environmental research and public health,142,17

RF ablation was performed using an internally cooled or expandable multitined electrode. The primary endpoint was complete response (CR) determined using (18)F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) performed 6 months after RF ablation. The secondary endpoint was the incidence and grade of adverse events (AEs) evaluated using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. RESULTS All patients underwent RF ablation and had efficacy analyses evaluated; however, FDG-PET/CT images before RF ablation were not available for two patients. The CR rate was 68 % (21 of 31 patients). One patient had a grade 5 AE unrelated to RF ablation. Grade ≥3 AEs occurred in 12 % of patients. During the follow-up period (median 37 months; range 1-55 months), five patients developed local tumor progression and nine (29 %) died. Overall survival at 1, 2, and 3 years was 97, 82, and 74 %, respectively.

However, the mediators and molecular pathways involved in human platelet-mediated NET generation remain poorly defined. Circulating plasma exosomes mostly originating from platelets may induce vascular apoptosis and myocardial dysfunction during sepsis; however, their role in NET formation remains unclear. This study aimed to detect whether platelet-derived exosomes could promote NET formation during septic shock and determine the potential mechanisms involved. METHODS Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were cocultured with exosomes isolated from the plasma of healthy controls and septic shock patients or the supernatant of human platelets stimulated ex vivo with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A lethal cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model was used to mimic sepsis in vivo; then, NET formation and molecular pathways were detected. RESULTS NET components (dsDNA and MPO-DNA complexes) were significantly increased in response to treatment with septic shock patient-derived exosomes and correlated positively with disease severity and outcome. In the animal CLP model, platelet depletion reduced plasma exosome concentration, NET formation, and lung injury. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that exosomal high-mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1) and/or miR-15b-5p and miR-378a-3p induced NET formation through the Akt/mTOR autophagy pathway. Furthermore, the results suggested that IκB kinase (IKK) controls platelet-derived exosome secretion in septic shock. CONCLUSIONS Platelet-derived exosomes promote excessive NET formation in sepsis and subsequent organ injury. This finding suggests a previously unidentified role of platelet-derived exosomes in sepsis and may lead to new therapeutic approaches.","Jiao, Yang; Li, Weiwei; Wang, Wei; Tong, Xingyu; Xia, Ran; Fan, Jie; Du, Jianer; Zhang, Chengmi; Shi, Xueyin",Critical care,142,14

METHODS We conducted interviews with 40 pregnant women to identify components of decision-making regarding prenatal genetic screens and tests at this visit. Analysis was approached using grounded theory. RESULTS Participants brought distinct notions of risk to the visit, including skewed perceptions of baseline risk for a fetal genetic condition and the implications of screening and testing. Participants were very concerned about financial considerations associated with these options, ranking out-of-pocket costs on par with medical considerations. Participants noted diverging priorities at the first visit from those of their healthcare provider, leading to barriers to shared decision-making regarding screening and testing during this visit. CONCLUSION Research is needed to determine how to restructure the initiation of prenatal care in a way that best positions patients to make informed decisions about prenatal genetic screens and tests.

METHODS Eight hundred and three patients undergoing 871 consecutive hip and knee arthroplasties (including sixty-one in patients with inflammatory arthritis and 810 in patients with noninflammatory arthritis) were prospectively evaluated for periprosthetic joint infection. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and synovial fluid white blood-cell count with differential were obtained routinely. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to establish optimal thresholds for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection, and the area under the curve was calculated to determine the overall accuracy of these tests for patients with inflammatory compared with noninflammatory arthritis. RESULTS The utility of all serum and synovial tests for predicting chronic periprosthetic joint infection was similar for patients with noninflammatory and inflammatory arthritis. The optimal cutoffs in patients with noninflammatory and inflammatory arthritis were 32 and 30 mm/hr, respectively, for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate; 15 and 17 mg/L, respectively, for the C-reactive protein level; 3450/μL and 3444/μL, respectively, for the synovial fluid white blood-cell count; and 78% and 75%, respectively, for the differential. The areas under the curves were similar for the two groups (84.9% and 85.0%, respectively, for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate; 88.5% and 85.1%, respectively, for the C-reactive protein level; 94.5% and 93.8%, respectively, for the synovial fluid white blood-cell count, and 95.0% and 93.6%, respectively, for the differential). Finally, the sensitivities, specificities, negative predictive values, and positive predictive values for all tests were also comparable in both groups. The rate of periprosthetic joint infection was significantly higher following procedures in patients with inflammatory arthritis than following procedures in patients with noninflammatory arthritis (31% compared with 18%; p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and synovial fluid white blood-cell count with differential are useful for diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection in patients with inflammatory as well as noninflammatory arthritis, with similar optimal cutoff values and overall testing performance. The synovial fluid white blood-cell count and differential performed the best for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection. Physicians evaluating patients with a failed or painful total hip or knee arthroplasty should not assume that elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and synovial fluid white blood-cell count with differential is secondary to inflammatory arthropathy; rather, elevation of these markers may indicate periprosthetic joint infection, and further evaluation for infection is warranted.","Cipriano, Cara A; Brown, Nicholas M; Michael, Andrew M; Moric, Mario; Sporer, Scott M; Della Valle, Craig J",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Availability is ensured by dietary intake of its precursors and by de novo production via sunlight. Yet, vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are very common across the globe and are connected to many pathophysiological states, for example, diabetes mellitus, allergies, autoimmune diseases, pregnancy complications, and recently have also been associated with worse COVID-19 clinical outcomes. SUMMARY In this review, we summarize current knowledge about vitamin D metabolism in general, its role in diabetes mellitus (mainly type 2) and diabetic complications (mainly diabetic kidney disease), and potential therapeutic perspectives including vitamin D signalling as a druggable target. Key Messages: Vitamin D is not only a vitamin but also a hormone involved in many physiological processes. Its insufficiency or deficiency can lead to many pathological states.","Galuška, David; Pácal, Lukáš; Kaňková, Kateřina",Kidney & blood pressure research,142,27

In France the concept of precariousness, akin to social deprivation, was developed and is widely used. EPICES is a short questionnaire that was developed to measure this concept. This study aimed to evaluate Differential Item Functioning (DIF) in the EPICES questionnaire between contrasted areas: mainland France, French West Indies (FWI) and French Guiana (FG). METHODS The population was taken from the INDIA study, which aimed to evaluate the impact of social inequalities on stroke characteristics and prognosis. Eligible people were patients referred to neurology or emergency departments for a suspicion of stroke. We assessed the DIF using hybrid ordinal logistic regression method, derived from item response theory. RESULTS We analysed 1 553 stroke patients, including 768 from FWI (49.5%), 289 from FG (18.6%) and 496 from mainland (31.9%). We identified five items with a moderate to large DIF in area comparisons: ""meeting with a social worker"", ""complementary health insurance"", ""home-owning"", ""financial difficulties"" and ""sport activities"". Correlation between EPICES score and the latent variable was strong (r = 0.84). CONCLUSION This is the first attempt to assess the DIF of the EPICES score between different French populations. We found several items with DIF, which can be explained by individual interpretation or local context. However, the DIFs did not lead to a large difference between the latent variable and the EPICES score, which indicates that it can be used to assess precariousness and social deprivation between contrasted areas.","Guilloteau, Adrien; Binquet, Christine; Bourredjem, Abderrahmane; Fournel, Isabelle; Lalanne-Mistrih, Marie Laure; Nacher, Mathieu; Rochemont, Devi; Cabie, André; Mimeau, Emmanuelle; Mislin-Tritsch, Caroline; Joux, Julien; Lannuzel, Annie; Bonithon-Kopp, Claire; Béjot, Yannick; Devilliers, Hervé",PloS one,142,0

Material and methods Patients were randomized into Group 1 ( n = 11, mean age: 65.3 ± 4.2 years, received iloprost infusion protocol alone) or Group 2 ( n = 11, mean age: 62.9 ± 6.7, received iloprost infusion plus standardized protocol of peroneal nerve electrostimulation). Electrostimulation was delivered with 1 Hz frequency, 27 mA current, and 200 ms pulse width. Peak blood flow velocities in the anterior and posterior tibialis arteries were measured with duplex ultrasound. Results There was a slight insignificant increase in blood velocity in anterior tibialis artery in Group 1 (from 17.6 ± 13.0 to 18.6 ± 13.1, p = 0.57), whereas the increase in Group 2 was marked (from 23.8 ± 18.3 to 32.2 ± 19.7, p = 0.01). Blood velocity in posterior tibialis artery also increased in both groups, but it was not of statistical significance. No significant difference was found between two groups in regard to final pulse oximetry oxygen saturation levels. Conclusion Electrostimulation of the peroneal nerve caused a substantial increase in anterior tibialis artery blood velocity when used as an adjunct to medical therapy in patients with critical limb ischemia.","Yilmaz, Seyhan; Mermi, Esra U; Zobaci, Ethem; Aksoy, Eray; Yastı, Çınar",Vascular,142,1

METHODS We analyzed clinical characteristics of 18 severely or critically ill patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheal intubation. The general demographic and clinical data of the patients including their age, gender, pre- intubation state of consciousness and the ventilation mode were recorded. The anesthesiologists performing the tracheal intubation procedure evaluated and recorded the tracheal intubation conditions of the patients. The changes in the vital signs of the patients before anesthesia induction and after intubation were recorded. RESULTS The average ages of these patients were 70.39±8.02 years. Fifteen patients (83.33%) received non- invasive ventilation before tracheal intubation, and 13 patients (72.22%) were conscious before tracheal intubation. After induction of anesthesia, the blood pressure and heart rate of the patients decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Most of the patients (94.44%) were in excellent or good conditions for tracheal intubation, and the first-attempt success rate of tracheal intubation was 100%. Five patients died within 3 weeks following the intubation. Tracheotomy was performed in one patient. Twelve patients were still on endotracheal mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit, and one of them received ECMO treatment due to poor oxygenation. A total of 16 experienced anesthesiologists participated in tracheal intubation, all with third-level protection during the operation, and no medical staff infection has been detected so far. CONCLUSIONS For patients with severe and critical COVID-19 and indications of tracheal intubation, we recommend early intubation with invasive respiratory support to improve the treatment efficacy and reduce the mortality. Anesthetic agents should be used carefully during tracheal intubation to ensure patients' safety. The medical staff should have a high-level protection during the intubation to maximally ensure their safety.","Wang, Jiafang; Lu, Fan; Zhou, Mingxing; Qi, Zhong; Chen, Zhijun",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,142,1

Increased tensile strength of the repair and decreased suture material at the repair site may be 2 methods of improving biologic and biomechanical outcomes, and conduit-assisted repair can aid in achieving both of these goals. METHODS Ninety-nine fresh-frozen digital nerves were equally divided into 11 different groups. Each group uses a different combination of number of sutures at the coaptation site and number of sutures at each end of the nerve-conduit junction, as well as 2 calibers of nylon suture. Nerves were transected, repaired with these various suture configurations using an AxoGuard conduit, and loaded to failure. RESULTS The 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that repairs performed with 8-0 suture have significantly higher maximum failure load compared with 9-0 suture repairs ( P < .01). Increasing the number of sutures in the repair significantly increased the maximum failure load in all groups regardless of suture caliber used ( P < .01). Repairs with 9-0 suture at the coaptation site did not jeopardize repair strength when compared with 8-0 suture. CONCLUSIONS Conduit-assisted primary digital nerve repairs with 8-0 suture increases the maximum load to failure compared with repairs with 9-0 suture, as does increasing the overall number of sutures. Using 9-0 suture at the coaptation site with 8-0 suture at the nerve-conduit junction does not jeopardize tensile strength when compared with similar repairs using all 8-0 suture and may decrease inflammation at the repair site while still achieving sufficient tensile strength.","Babovic, Nikola; Klaus, Derek; Schessler, Matthew J; Schimoler, Patrick J; Kharlamov, Alexander; Miller, Mark C; Tang, Peter",Hand,142,25

There are no case reports of MPFL reconstruction for chronic patellofemoral instability due to MPFL injury in aged populations. CASE PRESENTATION 81-year-old female presented with left knee pain, giving way, and patellar instability while climbing stairs, which continued for 18 months. Patellar apprehension test was positive, and roentgenogram showed lateral patellar subluxation. Conservative therapy was not successful; hence, we performed a lateral release and MPFL reconstruction surgery. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE After arthroscopic lateral release, the hamstring tendon was harvested, and a graft composite made of doubled hamstring tendon and polyester tape with a suspensory fixation device was prepared. Then, a femoral bone tunnel was constructed in a socket shape at the anatomical footprint of the MPFL. The graft was passed through the femoral tunnel, and free ends of the graft composite were sutured to the periosteum of the patella, using two suture anchors at 60° of knee flexion with patellar reduction. Physiotherapy was gradually started using a patella-stabilizing orthosis on the first postoperative day. Her Kujala score improved from 66 to 97 points, and Barthel index score improved from 70 to 100 points at 1 year after surgery. She neither developed patellofemoral joint OA nor had any recurrence of symptoms at the 5-year postoperative follow up. CONCLUSION MPFL reconstruction using the hamstring tendon is an effective procedure for patients with chronic patellofemoral instability even after the age of 80 years.","Takahashi, Tsuneari; Takeshita, Katsushi",The open orthopaedics journal,142,1

There has been concern that trainees may not achieve the procedural numbers required to graduate as independent electrophysiologists within the usual timeline. We sought to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the percentage of clinical cardiac EP (CCEP) fellows in jeopardy of not meeting procedural volume requirements and overall sentiments regarding preparedness of fellows for independent practice. METHODS We surveyed CCEP fellows and program directors about baseline procedural volumes, curriculum changes due to the pandemic, and attitudes about preparedness for board examinations and independent practice. RESULTS Ninety-nine fellows and 27 program directors responded to the survey. Ninety-eight percent of responding fellows reported a decrease in procedural volume as a result of the pandemic. Program directors reported an overall decrease in annual number of ablations and device procedures performed by each fellow during the 2019-2020 academic year compared to the preceding year. Despite this, a minority of fellows and program directors reported concerns about meeting Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education procedural requirements for devices (9%, 4%, respectively) and ablation (19%, 9%) or preparedness for independent practice after a two-year fellowship. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a decrease in procedural volume for CCEP trainees, but the majority of fellows and program directors do not anticipate major barriers to timely graduation.

The two most important diagnostic procedures used to evaluate tubal patency are hysterosalpingography and laparoscopy. Objectives To asses the hysterosalpingography and laparoscopy results of patients diagnosed with infertility and investigate the diagnostic value of hysterosalpingography in patients with tubal factor infertility. Methods The hysterosalpingography and laparoscopy results of 208 patients who presented to the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic at Dicle University, Faculty of Medicine between January 2014- January 2018 were retrospectively evaluated. Hysterosalpingography and laparoscopy results were compared with regard to the investigation of the presence of tubal obstruction and of the pelvic structures that could cause tubal obstruction. The specificity, sensitivity, positive, and negative predictive values of hysterosalpingography were computed. Results The number of patients evaluated was 208. The ratio of primary infertile patients was 57.2% and 42.8% was secondary infertile.

Benefits include no visible scars, less pain, and shorter recovery time. We describe a video of a 37-year-old female who underwent a pure transvaginal appendectomy (TVA) for acute appendicitis. This is 1 of 18 successfully performed TVAs at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Appropriate Institutional Review Board was obtained preoperatively. METHODS The patient was positioned in steep Trendelenburg and then a weighted speculum was introduced into the vagina allowing exposure of the posterior vaginal fornix. The cervix was grasped with a single-toothed tenaculum on the posterior cervical lip and the posterior vaginal fornix was visualized. Access to the peritoneum was achieved by electrocautery and then sharp dissection. A SILS™ port (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) was introduced and pneumoperitoneum up to 15 mmHg was achieved. Two 5-mm trocars and one 12-mm trocar were used. A 5-mm 30° angled endoscope, a flexible reticulating endograsper, and straight standard instruments were used. The identified appendix was dissected and a stapler was used to divide the mesoappendix from the appendix. Following confirmation of good hemostasis and no spillage of bowel contents, the appendix was removed from the abdomen within a retrieval bag and the culdotomy was closed with a running absorbable suture. The patient tolerated the 27 min procedure well and was discharged home in good condition on postoperative day 1.","Roberts, Kurt E; Silasi, Dan-Arin; Bell, Robert L; Duffy, Andrew J",Surgical endoscopy,142,11

In this paper were investigated the physiological traits of two populations of Dictyota dichotoma var. intricata, living at two different pH for several generations to assess the reasons of the algae reduced abundance at current (8.1) compared to low pH (6.7). Besides, through transplant experiments, the two populations were analysed for the stress response and reversibility of physiological performance at different pH. The long-term acclimation to high pCO2/low pH favours an ecotype characterised by low energetic costs, higher photochemical efficiency and more resistance to the oxidative stress, compared to individuals living at current pH. These traits promoted the growth and reproduction of the community living at pH 6.7, favouring a lower macroalgal diversity, but a higher ecological success under ocean acidification. The similar behaviour observed between Dictyota living at pH 6.7 and transplanted thalli from pH 6.7 to 8.1, suggested a high tolerance to pH changes in the short-term. On the contrary, adaptive responses may have favoured molecular adjustments on the long-term, as showed by the significant differences between the wild populations at pH 8.1 and 6.7. The overall data indicate that both plasticity and adaptive mechanisms may be the reasons for the success of the brown seaweeds under future high pCO2/low pH. The plasticity due to photochemistry adjustments is likely involved in the early response to environmental changes. Conversely, modifications in the photosynthetic biochemical machinery suggest that more complex adaptive mechanisms occurred in the current population of Dictyota living at pH 6.7. Further studies on population genetics will reveal if any differentiation is taking place at the population level or a local adaptation has already occurred in Dictyota and other brown algae under chronic low pH.","Porzio, Lucia; Arena, Carmen; Lorenti, Maurizio; De Maio, Anna; Buia, Maria Cristina",The Science of the total environment,142,16

Design, Setting, and Participants Parallel, open-label, pragmatic randomized clinical trial conducted at 4 socioeconomically diverse clinics in India that recruited patients with type 2 diabetes; a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score of at least 10 (range, 0-27); and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of at least 8%, systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at least 140 mm Hg, or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of at least 130 mg/dL. The first patient was enrolled on March 9, 2015, and the last was enrolled on May 31, 2016; the final follow-up visit was July 14, 2018. Interventions Patients randomized to the intervention group (n = 196) received 12 months of self-management support from nonphysician care coordinators, decision support electronic health records facilitating physician treatment adjustments, and specialist case reviews; they were followed up for an additional 12 months without intervention. Patients in the control group (n = 208) received usual care over 24 months. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the between-group difference in the percentage of patients at 24 months who had at least a 50% reduction in Symptom Checklist Depression Scale (SCL-20) scores (range, 0-4; higher scores indicate worse symptoms) and a reduction of at least 0.5 percentage points in HbA1c, 5 mm Hg in SBP, or 10 mg/dL in LDL cholesterol. Prespecified secondary outcomes were percentage of patients at 12 and 24 months who met treatment targets (HbA1c <7.0%, SBP <130 mm Hg, LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dL [<70 mg/dL if prior cardiovascular disease]) or had improvements in individual outcomes (≥50% reduction in SCL-20 score, ≥0.5-percentage point reduction in HbA1c, ≥5-mm Hg reduction in SBP, ≥10-mg/dL reduction in LDL cholesterol); percentage of patients who met all HbA1c, SBP, and LDL cholesterol targets; and mean reductions in SCL-20 score, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score, HbA1c, SBP, and LDL cholesterol. Results Among 404 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 53 [8.6] years; 165 [40.8%] men), 378 (93.5%) completed the trial. A significantly greater percentage of patients in the intervention group vs the usual care group met the primary outcome (71.6% vs 57.4%; risk difference, 16.9% [95% CI, 8.5%-25.2%]). Of 16 prespecified secondary outcomes, there were no statistically significant between-group differences in improvements in 10 outcomes at 12 months and in 13 outcomes at 24 months. Serious adverse events in the intervention and usual care groups included cardiovascular events or hospitalizations (4 [2.0%] vs 7 [3.4%]), stroke (0 vs 3 [1.4%]), death (2 [1.0%] vs 7 [3.4%]), and severe hypoglycemia (8 [4.1%] vs 0). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with diabetes and depression in India, a 12-month collaborative care intervention, compared with usual care, resulted in statistically significant improvements in a composite measure of depressive symptoms and cardiometabolic indices at 24 months. Further research is needed to understand the generalizability of the findings to other low- and middle-income health care settings.

Some have argued that not only was the definition changed, but that it was done to pave the way for declaring a pandemic. Others claim that the definition was never changed and that this allegation is completely unfounded. Such polarized views have hampered our ability to draw important conclusions. This impasse, combined with concerns over potential conflicts of interest and doubts about the proportionality of the response to the H1N1 influenza outbreak, has undermined the public trust in health officials and our collective capacity to effectively respond to future disease threats. WHO did not change its definition of pandemic influenza for the simple reason that it has never formally defined pandemic influenza. While WHO has put forth many descriptions of pandemic influenza, it has never established a formal definition and the criteria for declaring a pandemic caused by the H1N1 virus derived from ""pandemic phase"" definitions, not from a definition of ""pandemic influenza"". The fact that despite ten years of pandemic preparedness activities no formal definition of pandemic influenza has been formulated reveals important underlying assumptions about the nature of this infectious disease. In particular, the limitations of ""virus-centric"" approaches merit further attention and should inform ongoing efforts to ""learn lessons"" that will guide the response to future outbreaks of novel infectious diseases.","Doshi, Peter",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,142,12

METHODS The method was literature review. RESULTS An infectious aerosol is a collection of pathogen-laden particles in air. Aerosol particles may deposit onto or be inhaled by a susceptible person. Aerosol transmission is biologically plausible when infectious aerosols are generated by or from an infectious person, the pathogen remains viable in the environment for some period of time, and the target tissues in which the pathogen initiates infection are accessible to the aerosol. Biological plausibility of aerosol transmission is evaluated for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and norovirus and discussed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza, and Ebola virus. CONCLUSIONS Aerosol transmission reflects a modern understanding of aerosol science and allows physically appropriate explanation and intervention selection for infectious diseases.","Jones, Rachael M; Brosseau, Lisa M",Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,142,0

The TICI scale is ordinal and observer-dependent, which may result in suboptimal prediction of patient outcome and inconsistent reperfusion grading. AIMS We present a semi-automated quantitative reperfusion measure (quantified TICI (qTICI)) using image processing techniques based on the TICI methodology. METHODS We included patients with an intracranial proximal large vessel occlusion with complete, good quality runs of anteroposterior and lateral digital subtraction angiography from the MR CLEAN Registry. For each vessel occlusion, we identified the target downstream territory and automatically segmented the reperfused area in the target downstream territory on final digital subtraction angiography. qTICI was defined as the percentage of reperfused area in target downstream territory. The value of qTICI and extended TICI (eTICI) in predicting favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) was compared using area under receiver operating characteristics curve and binary logistic regression analysis unadjusted and adjusted for known prognostic factors. RESULTS In total, 408 patients with M1 or internal carotid artery occlusion were included. The median qTICI was 78 (interquartile range 58-88) and 215 patients (53%) had an eTICI of 2C or higher. qTICI was comparable to eTICI in predicting favorable outcome with area under receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.63 vs. 0.62 (P = 0.8) and 0.87 vs. 0.86 (P = 0.87), for the unadjusted and adjusted analysis, respectively. In the adjusted regression analyses, both qTICI and eTICI were independently associated with functional outcome.

The disease was later named as a novel Coronavirus disease or COVID-19. It was then declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019. As of February 5, 2021, 103 million laboratory-confirmed cases and nearly 2.3 million deaths have been reported globally. The number of death tolls continue to rise, and a large number of countries have been forced to implement social distancing and lockdown. As per literature, Coronavirus is transmitted human to human or human to animal via airborne droplets. Coronavirus enters the human cell through membrane ACE-2 exopeptidase receptor. WHO, ECDC, and ICMR advised to avoid public places and close contact with infected persons and pet animals. To date, there is no evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19. The main therapies being used to treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, and respiratory therapy. Although several therapies have been proposed, quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the contagion rate. We conducted a literature review of publicly available information to summarize knowledge about the pathogen and the current epidemic. In the present literature review, the causative agents of the pandemic, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis techniques are discussed. Further, currently used treatment and prevention strategies along with vaccine trials and computational tools are all described in detail.","Sharma, Rahul; Khokhar, Dharmendra; Gupta, Bhanushree; Saxena, Purnendu; Ghosh, Kallol Kumar; Geda, Arvind Kumar; Kuca, Kamil",Current medicinal chemistry,142,12

However, given issues in accuracy with mammography, there is a need for evolving evidence-based surveillance recommendations with supplemental imaging. In this systematic review, we compiled and compared existing studies that describe the test performance of surveillance breast MRI among women with PHBC. METHODS We searched PubMed and EMBASE using MeSH terms for studies (2000-2019) that described the diagnostic characteristics of breast MRI in women with PHBC. Search results were reviewed and included based on PICOTS criteria; quality of included articles was assessed using QUADAS-2. Meta-analysis of single proportions was conducted for diagnostic characteristics of breast MRI, including tests of heterogeneity. RESULTS Our review included 11 articles in which unique cohorts were studied, comprised of a total of 8338 women with PHBC and 12,335 breast MRI done for the purpose of surveillance. We predict intervals (PI) for cancer detection rate per 1000 examinations (PI 9-15; I2 = 10%), recall rate (PI 5-31%; I2 = 97%), sensitivity (PI 58-95%; I2 = 47%), specificity (PI 76-97%; I2 = 97%), and PPV3 (PI 16-40%; I2 = 44%). CONCLUSIONS Studies addressing performance of breast MRI are variable and limited in population-based studies. The summary of evidence to date is insufficient to recommend for or against use of breast MRI for surveillance among women with PHBC.","Haas, Cameron B; Nekhlyudov, Larissa; Lee, Janie M; Javid, Sara H; Bush, Mary; Johnson, Dianne; Gleason, Timothy; Kaufman, Cary; Specht, Jennifer; Stitham, Sean; Wernli, Karen J",Breast cancer research and treatment,142,20

METHODS AND RESULTS In the present study, we explored the use of LE-PolyICLC, a liposome encapsulated double-stranded RNA, as a possible prophylactic, therapeutic and immune enhancement agent. In a mouse infection model, we showed that the administration of LE-PolyICLC intranasally before or shortly after infection could inhibit virus replication, leading to a significant reduction in pulmonary viral titres and a higher survival rate of infected mice. When used as a molecular adjuvant, LE-PolyICLC significantly enhanced both the humoral and cellular responses elicited by inactivated H5N1 vaccine and augmented the protective efficacy provided by vaccination. Most importantly, the data also demonstrate that LE-PolyICLC could effectively attenuate the development of pulmonary fibrosis during the restoration period at day 14 after H5N1 infection. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, the data obtained in the present study suggest that strong consideration should be given for the use of LE-PolyICLC as prophylactic and therapeutic agents and also as a vaccination adjuvant to combat highly pathogenic influenza infection and its associated complications such as pulmonary fibrosis.","Li, Yi; Hu, Yanxin; Jin, Yi; Zhang, Guozhong; Wong, Jonathan; Sun, Lun-Quan; Wang, Ming",The journal of gene medicine,142,16

These experiments are increasingly being applied in understanding the complex impacts of heavy metals, ocean acidification, global warming, and oil spills. The insights of the present review indicate how metals and metal-bound activities impact on various aspects of ecological complexities like prey predator cues, growth, embryonic development, and reproduction. Plankton and benthos are used more often over fish and microbes owing to their smaller size, faster reproduction, amenability, and repeatability during mesocosm experiments. The results of ocean acidification reveal calcification of plankton, corals, alteration of pelagic structures, and plankton blooms. The subtle effect of oil spills is amplified on sediment microorganisms, primary producers, and crustaceans. An overview of the mesocosm designs over the years indicates that gradual changes have evolved in the type, size, design, composition, parameters, methodology employed, and the outputs obtained. Most of the pelagic and benthic mesocosm designs involve consideration of interactions within the water columns, between water and sediments, trophic levels, and nutrient rivalry. Mesocosm structures are built considering physical processes (tidal currents, turbulence, inner cycling of nutrients, thermal stratification, and mixing), biological complexities (population, community, and ecosystem) using appropriate filling containers, and sampling facilities that employ inert materials. The principle of design is easy transportation, mooring, deployment, and free floating structures besides addressing the unique ecosystem-based science problems. The evolution of the mesocosm tools helps in understanding further advancement of techniques and their applications in marine ecosystems.","Sharma, Krishna Venkatarama; Sarvalingam, Barath Kumar; Marigoudar, Shambanagouda Rudragouda",Environmental science and pollution research international,142,1

Over the last 40 years, assisted reproductive technology (ART) has helped millions of childless couples. However, ART is limited by a low success rate and risk of multiple gestations. Devising methods for selecting the best gamete or embryo that increases the ART success rate and prevention of multiple gestation has become one of the key goals in ART today. Special emphasis has been placed on the development of non-invasive approaches, which do not require perturbing the embryonic cells, as the current morphology-based embryo selection approach has shortcomings in predicting the implantation potential of embryos. An observed association between embryo metabolism and viability has prompted researchers to develop metabolomics-based biomarkers. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides a non-invasive approach for the metabolic profiling of tissues, gametes and embryos, with the key advantage of having a minimal sample preparation procedure. Using NMR spectroscopy, biologically important molecules can be identified and quantified in intact cells, extracts or secretomes. This, in turn, helps to map out the active metabolic pathways in a system. The present review covers the contribution of NMR spectroscopy in assisted reproduction at various stages of the process.","Asampille, Gitanjali; Cheredath, Aswathi; Joseph, David; Adiga, Satish K; Atreya, Hanudatta S",Open biology,142,31

These associations appear to extend beyond the typical associations between violence and mental health, and to be independent of the effects of co-occurring forms of trauma and violence exposure. However, there is no existing theoretical framework within which we may understand the unique contributions of police violence to mental health and illness.This article aims to identify potential factors that may distinguish police violence from other forms of violence and trauma exposure, and to explore the possibility that this unique combination of factors distinguishes police violence from related risk exposures. We identify 8 factors that may alter this relationship, including those that increase the likelihood of overall exposure, increase the psychological impact of police violence, and impede the possibility of coping or recovery from such exposures.On the basis of these factors, we propose a theoretical framework for the further study of police violence from a public mental health perspective.

As the major types of programmed cell death, autophagy and apoptosis have been observed in response to H2O2-mediated oxidative stress and have been demonstrated to be responsible for porcine GC death. To date, however, the cellular reactions linking autophagy to the apoptosis of porcine GC under oxidative stress are still poorly understood. Porcine GC were treated with H2O2, and autophagic flux was examined by western blotting. Cell viability and cell death assays were performed after cotreatment of porcine GC with autophagy activator (rapamycin) or inhibitor (3-methyladenine, 3-MA) together with H2O2. We revealed that short exposure (1-3 h) of porcine GC to H2O2 dramatically increased autophagic flux (1.8- to 2.5-fold over that in the control), whereas 6-12 h prolonged treatment decreased autophagy but elevated the caspase-3 activity and GC apoptotic rate. Furthermore, we showed that pretreatment with rapamycin exacerbated H2O2-mediated cytotoxicity and caspase-3 activation but that 3-MA or siRNAs specific for Beclin 1 and Atg7 genes ameliorated H2O2-mediated GC apoptosis. Together, our results indicate that autophagy plays a pivotal role in H2O2-mediated porcine GC apoptosis. Importantly, we show that the early induction of autophagic flux contributes to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in porcine GC. The results also suggest that regulating the autophagy response in porcine GC under oxidative stress might be a new strategy for abnormal follicular atresia.","Zhang, Jia-Qing; Ren, Qiao-Ling; Chen, Jun-Feng; Gao, Bin-Wen; Wang, Xian-Wei; Zhang, Zi-Jing; Wang, Jing; Xu, Ze-Jun; Xing, Bao-Song",Reproductive sciences,142,1

OBJECTIVE This study examined the minimally invasive surgical trends, patient characteristics, and operative variables unique to patients undergoing hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery. DESIGN This was a retrospective medical chart review. SETTINGS The study was conducted in a tertiary care medical center. PATIENTS Patients included in the study were those who underwent pure laparoscopic colectomies, hand-assisted laparoscopic colectomies, and traditional open surgery for elective treatment of diverticular disease, colorectal cancer, IBD, and benign polyp disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes included patient characteristics and operative variables unique to patients undergoing hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery and documentation of operative technique trends within an experienced colorectal group. RESULTS Diverticular disease characteristics specific to hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery included the presence of dense inflammatory adhesions (p < 0.0001), diverticular fistulas (p < 0.0001), and unresolved phlegmon (p = 0.0003). Characteristics specific for colorectal cancer included intraoperative tumor bulk (p < 0.0001) and the inability to achieve appropriate surgical resection margins (p < 0.001). Similarly, variables identified for benign polyp disease included adhesions (p < 0.0001) and the ability to gain adequate exposure (p < 0.0001). Limited use of hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery was observed in patients with IBD. LIMITATIONS This was a retrospective, observational study from a single center. CONCLUSIONS Conversion to hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery provides benefit in surgical scenarios where dense inflammatory adhesions, diverticular fistulas, and intra-abdominal postdiverticulitis phlegmon are present. In addition, benefit is observed in patients with colorectal cancer where laparoscopic dissection of bulky tumor proves to be difficult and where the technical ability to obtain margins using pure laparoscopy is compromised. Although our practice has changed to favor pure laparoscopy, hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery continues to play an important role in complex colorectal cases that otherwise would require open surgery (see video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/DCR/A146).","Jadlowiec, Caroline C; Mannion, Elizabeth M; Thielman, Mary J; Bartus, Christine M; Johnson, Kristina H; Sardella, William V; Vignati, Paul V; Cohen, Jeffrey L",Diseases of the colon and rectum,142,1

Here, we describe an outbreak of FLS in Arizona from which an IBV variant that is nearly 90% homologous to DMV/1639 using the Spike subunit 1 gene, named AZ/FLS/17, was isolated and used in challenge experiments. Three-day-old specific-pathogen-free chicks were challenged with AZ/FLS/17 or M41 in high and low doses, and the disease outcomes were compared. Overall, no differences in microscopic lesions or viral loads in the reproductive tract were detected between AZ/FLS/17- and M41-infected birds. To minimize the losses linked to FLS in the problematic flocks, an updated live-attenuated IBV vaccine protocol including the use of the Ma5 strain at the hatchery was implemented, resulting in a drastic reduction of false layers in the subsequent flocks. To monitor the circulation of wild-type and vaccine strains in this population, a molecular surveillance study was performed. Samples were collected at 1, 7, 14, and 21 days of age, and from laying hens at 30 and 36 wk. In older birds, the IBV strains detected were more diverse than at 1 and 7 days of age. Nevertheless, live vaccine combinations are still widely used to decrease the losses caused by FLS in commercial egg laying flocks worldwide.","da Silva, A P; Giroux, C; Sellers, H S; Mendoza-Reilley, A; Stoute, S; Gallardo, R A",Avian diseases,142,1

At the same time, single-port access surgery has fostered the development of new techniques and methods seeking better cosmetic results and less postoperative pain, while maintaining the satisfactory results obtained by the standard laparoscopic approach. One of the problems associated to single-access surgery is the lack of traction and the difficulties to retract the liver. The authors' aim was to try to avoid additional trocars or sutures in order to perform pure single-incision surgery, using 2 magnetic forceps. METHODS The authors present the case of a 51-year-old morbidly obese female (body mass index = 44.82) who underwent a pure single-access laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with no additional trocars or sutures and assisted by 2 neodymium magnetic forceps: one to retract the liver and the other to retract the stomach in order to provide sufficient triangulation for adequate exposure of the surgical field during dissection. RESULTS The procedure was completed in 120 minutes. No preoperative or postoperative complications were recorded, and the patient was discharged 2 days after surgery. CONCLUSION Single-port access sleeve gastrectomy assisted by magnetic forceps is feasible and safe in the hands of experienced laparoscopic surgeons, solving one of the problems associated to this type of surgery, that is, the need for an additional trocar and needles or sutures to retract the liver and stomach in order to perform the operation.","Morales-Conde, Salvador; Dominguez, Guillermo; Gomez, Jesus Cañete; Socas, María; Barranco, Antonio; Moreno, Joaquin García; Padillo, Francisco Javier",Surgical innovation,142,19

Although nonstandard tubes can be placed over the percutaneous kit dilator, clinicians often place standard tracheostomy tubes and change to nonstandard tubes only after problems arise. This practice risks early tracheostomy tube change, possible bleeding, or loss of the airway. We sought to identify predictors of nonstandard tracheostomy tubes. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this matched case-control study at an urban, academic, tertiary care medical center, we reviewed 1220 records of patients who received a tracheostomy. Seventy-seven patients received nonstandard tracheostomy tubes (cases), and 154 received standard tracheostomy tubes (controls). RESULTS Sex, endotracheal tube size, severity of illness, and computed tomography scan measurement of the distance from the trachea to the skin at the level of the superior aspect of the anterior clavicle were significant predictors of nonstandard tracheostomy tubes.

Revascularization of the foot is now often performed by using percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; over a 4-year period, the authors performed more than 2500 antegrade interventional procedures in patients with critical limb ischemia, diabetes, and infrainguinal arterial disease. Intraprocedural angiography of the foot is crucial for successful planning and guidance of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in tibial and pedal arteries, and its effective use requires both anatomic knowledge and technical skill. To select the best revascularization strategy and obtain optimal clinical results, interventional radiologists, cardiologists, and vascular surgeons performing below-the-knee endovascular procedures also must be familiar with the functional aspects of circulation in the foot.

Here we show that the transcription factor Glis1 induces multi-level epigenetic and metabolic remodelling in stem cells that facilitates the induction of pluripotency. We find that Glis1 enables reprogramming of senescent cells into pluripotent cells and improves genome stability. During early phases of reprogramming, Glis1 directly binds to and opens chromatin at glycolytic genes, whereas it closes chromatin at somatic genes to upregulate glycolysis. Subsequently, higher glycolytic flux enhances cellular acetyl-CoA and lactate levels, thereby enhancing acetylation (H3K27Ac) and lactylation (H3K18la) at so-called 'second-wave' and pluripotency gene loci, opening them up to facilitate cellular reprogramming. Our work highlights Glis1 as a powerful reprogramming factor, and reveals an epigenome-metabolome-epigenome signalling cascade that involves the glycolysis-driven coordination of histone acetylation and lactylation in the context of cell fate determination.","Li, Linpeng; Chen, Keshi; Wang, Tianyu; Wu, Yi; Xing, Guangsuo; Chen, Mengqi; Hao, Zhihong; Zhang, Cheng; Zhang, Jinye; Ma, Bochao; Liu, Zihuang; Yuan, Hao; Liu, Zijian; Long, Qi; Zhou, Yanshuang; Qi, Juntao; Zhao, Danyun; Gao, Mi; Pei, Duanqing; Nie, Jinfu; Ye, Dan; Pan, Guangjin; Liu, Xingguo",Nature metabolism,142,1

We sought to determine the efficacy of intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV r-tPA) in a subset of patients with mild deficit in the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). METHODS IST-3 compared IV r-tPA with control within 6 hours of onset in patients for whom IV r-tPA was considered promising but unproven. Analysis was restricted to subjects randomized within 3 hours of onset with a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≤5, pretreatment blood pressure <185/110, and no other r-tPA exclusion criteria. We compared r-tPA and control arms for primary (Oxfordshire Handicap Score [OHS] 0-2) and secondary (ordinal OHS and OHS 0-1) outcomes at 6 months. RESULTS Among 3035 IST-3 subjects, 612 (20.2%) had an National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≤5; of these 106 (17.6%) met the restricted criteria. Allocation to r-tPA was associated with an increase in OHS 0 to 2 (84% r-tPA versus 65% control; adjusted odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-8.79) and a favorable shift in OHS distribution (adjusted odds ratio, 2.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-4.85). There was no significant effect of r-tPA on OHS 0 to 1 (60% versus 51%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-4.43).

Although medical students world-wide have reported an increased level of anxiety, factors in the academic setting during ERL that influenced anxiety levels have not been studied yet. The present study aimed to evaluate anxiety levels of first year medical students and its correlation with academic factors during ERL. Methods ERL for neuroanatomy was conducted for six weeks mainly by online small group teaching. At completion, feedback was collected from students (n = 97) which included a GAD-7 questionnaire for anxiety levels and a modified VARK analysis to record changes in learning styles. Results Of 97 students (M46, F51) 43.30% had minimal, 31.96% mild, 10.31% moderate and 14.43% severe anxiety. Academic exchanges such as student-teacher interaction (80.41%), tutor feedback (90.72%) and mentor meetings (81.44%) were reported to be advantageous. There was a significant (p = 0.0056) correlation between enjoyment of small group discussion and lower GAD-7 scores. There was significant change in perceived learning styles during ERL. Video calls (p = 0.018) and gaming (p = 0.022) were significant modes of stress relief. There was significant correlation (p = 0.022) between gaming and GAD-7 scores. Conclusion About one-fourth of the students faced anxiety issues during ERL period. Small group interactions with focus on promoting connectedness and interaction, augmented by feedback, mentorship, familial and social support are important in reducing anxiety which should be kept in mind by educators while delivering such learning experiences.","Srivastava, Supraja; Jacob, Jenny; Charles, Aby S; Daniel, Priyanka; Mathew, John K; Shanthi, Pauline; Devamani, Kiran; Mahasampath, Gowri; Rabi, Suganthy","Medical journal, Armed Forces India",142,16

However, their effects on dynamic hyperinflation, an important mechanism contributing to symptoms and exercise tolerance in patients with COPD, have not been evaluated. Twenty-seven patients with moderate to severe COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second 52 ± 13% predicted) completed pulmonary function tests, echocardiography, maximal exercise tests, and cycle endurance tests at baseline. Inspiratory capacity was measured at 2-minute intervals during the cycle endurance test to quantify dynamic hyperinflation. Pulmonary function and cycle endurance testing were repeated after 14 days of bisoprolol 10 mg/day and 14 days of placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. The extent of dynamic hyperinflation at peak isotime exercise with bisoprolol and placebo was compared. Peak isotime was defined as the latest time point that was reached during the 2 cycle endurance tests. Changes in inspiratory capacity from rest to peak isotime were different with bisoprolol compared to placebo (-0.50 ± 0.35 vs -0.41 ± 0.33 L, p = 0.01). Exercise duration tended to be lower with bisoprolol compared to placebo (305 ± 125 vs 353 ± 172 seconds, p = 0.11). The magnitude of change in exercise duration between the bisoprolol and placebo conditions was correlated with the magnitude of change in inspiratory capacity (r = 0.57, p <0.01). In conclusion, bisoprolol was associated with modest worsening dynamic hyperinflation, whereas exercise duration remained unchanged in patients with moderate to severe COPD. The magnitude of these effects was small and should not contraindicate the use of bisoprolol in patients with COPD.","Mainguy, Vincent; Girard, Daniel; Maltais, François; Saey, Didier; Milot, Julie; Sénéchal, Mario; Poirier, Paul; Provencher, Steeve",The American journal of cardiology,142,29

DESIGN A 2019 online survey of board-certified physiatrists (n=616 completed, 30.1% response) collected information about demographics, practice characteristics, hours worked, and retirement intentions. Microsimulation models projected future physiatrist supply and demand using data from the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, national and state population projections, American Community Survey, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, and other sources. RESULTS Approximately 37% of 8,853 active physiatrists indicate their workload exceeds capacity, 59% indicate workload is at capacity, and 4% indicate under capacity. These findings suggest a 940 (10.6%) national shortfall of physiatrists in 2017 with substantial geographic variation in supply adequacy. Projected growth in physiatrist supply from 2017 to 2030 approximately equals demand growth (2,250 versus 2,390), suggesting that without changes in care delivery, the shortfall of physiatrists will persist with a 1,080 (9.7%) physiatrist shortfall in 2030. CONCLUSION Without an increase in physiatry residency positions the current national shortfall of physiatrists is projected to persist. While a projected increase in physiatrists' use of advanced practice providers may help preserve access to comprehensive physiatry care, it is not expected to eliminate the shortfall.","Dall, Timothy M; Reynolds, Ryan; Chakrabarti, Ritashree; Forte, Gaetano; Langelier, Margaret; Wang, Shen; Whyte, John; Ankam, Nethra Sridhara; Annaswamy, Thiru; Fredericson, Michael; Jain, Nitin B; Karimi, Danielle Perret; Morgenroth, David C; Slocum, Chloe; Wisotzky, Eric",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,142,1

Such targeted therapies have shown long-term relapse-free survival in patients with B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. However, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) represents a serious, potentially life-threatening side effect often associated with CAR T-cell therapy. CRS manifests as a rapid (hyper)immune reaction driven by excessive inflammatory cytokine release, including interferon-g and interleukin-6. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Many cytokines implicated in CRS are known to signal through the Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. Here we study the effect of blocking JAK pathway signaling on CAR T-cell proliferation, anti-tumor activity and cytokine levels in in vitro and in vivo models. RESULTS We report that itacitinib, a potent, selective JAK1 inhibitor, was able to significantly and dose-dependently reduce levels of multiple cytokines implicated in CRS in several in vitro and in vivo models. Importantly, we also report that at clinically relevant doses that mimic human JAK1 pharmacologic inhibition, itacitinib did not significantly inhibit proliferation or antitumor killing capacity of three different human CAR T-cell constructs (GD2, EGFR, and CD19). Finally, in an in vivo model, antitumor activity of CD19-CAR T-cells adoptively transferred into CD19+ tumor bearing immuno-deficient animals was unabated by oral itacitinib treatment. CONCLUSIONS Together, these data suggest that itacitinib has potential as a prophylactic agent for the prevention of CAR T-cell-induced CRS, and a phase II clinical trial of itacitinib for prevention of CRS induced by CAR T-cell therapy has been initiated (NCT04071366).","Huarte, Eduardo; O'Conner, Roddy S; Peel, Michael T; Nunez-Cruz, Selene; Leferovich, John; Juvekar, Ashish; Yang, Yan-Ou; Truong, Lisa; Huang, Taisheng; Naim, Ahmad; Milone, Michael C; Smith, Paul A",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,142,16

BIs greater than 40% of total body surface area are considered extensive and result in local and systemic response. We sought to assess morphological and myogenic mechanisms through both short- and long-term intensive insulin therapies that affect the skeletal muscle after extensive skin BI in young rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS Wistar rats aged 21 d were distributed into four groups: control (C), control with insulin (C + I), scald burn injury (SI), and SI with insulin (SI + I). The SI groups were submitted to a 45% total body surface area burn, and the C + I and SI + I groups received insulin (5 UI/Kg/d) for 4 or 14 d. Glucose tolerance and the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index were determined. Gastrocnemius muscles were analyzed for histopathological, morphometric, and immunohistochemical myogenic parameters (Pax7, MyoD, and MyoG); in addition, the expression of genes related to muscle atrophy (MuRF1 and MAFbx) and its regulation (IGF-1) were also assessed. RESULTS Short-term treatment with insulin favored muscle regeneration by primary myogenesis and decreased muscle atrophy in animals with BIs, whereas the long-term treatment modulated myogenesis by increasing the MyoD protein. Both treatments improved histopathological parameters and secondary myogenesis by increasing the MyoG protein. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with insulin benefits myogenic parameters during regeneration and modulates MuRF1, an important mediator of muscle atrophy.","Quintana, Hananiah Tardivo; Baptista, Vivianne Izabelle de Araújo; Lazzarin, Mariana Cruz; Antunes, Hanna Karen Moreira; Le Sueur-Maluf, Luciana; de Oliveira, Camila Aparecida Machado; de Oliveira, Flavia",The Journal of surgical research,142,1

Participants advocated a patient-centred approach by a colorectal specialist, within strong multidisciplinary teamworking. The use of anti-TNFα therapy is advocated. Where definitive surgical techniques are considered they should be carefully selected to avoid adverse impact on function. Ano/rectovaginal fistulas should be managed by specialists in fistulating disease.

It may be responsible for tandem occlusion defined by a cervical steno-occlusive carotid wall hematoma associated with an intracranial large-vessel stroke. Intravenous thrombolysis is associated with a poor clinical outcome in these cases, and endovascular treatment has not been specifically evaluated to date. Our aim was to evaluate endovascular treatment technical and clinical efficiency in this specific occlusion topography, in comparison with treatment of isolated anterior circulation stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS As part of our ongoing prospective stroke data base started in August 2009 (Prognostic Factors Related to Clinical Outcome Following Thrombectomy in Ischemic Stroke [RECOST] Study), we analyzed all carotid artery dissection tandem occlusion strokes and isolated anterior circulation occlusions. All patients were selected for endovascular treatment according to clinical-radiologic mismatch, NIHSS ≥ 7 and DWI-ASPECTS ≥5, within 6 hours after onset. For carotid artery dissection, the revascularization procedure consisted first of distal recanalization by a stent retriever in the intracranial vessel. Following assessment of the circle of Willis, internal carotid artery stent placement was only performed in case of insufficiency. Carotid artery dissection treatment efficacy, safety, and clinical outcome were compared with the results of the isolated anterior circulation occlusion cohort. RESULTS Two hundred fifty-eight patients with an anterior circulation stroke were analyzed, including 57 with tandem occlusions (22%); among them, 20 were carotid artery dissection-related occlusions (7.6%). The median age of patients with tandem occlusions with internal carotid dissection was 52.45 versus 66.85 years for isolated anterior circulation occlusion (P < .05); the mean initial NIHSS score was 17.53 ± 4.11 versus 17.55 ± 4.8 (P = .983). The median DWI-ASPECTS was 6.05 versus 6.64 (P = .098), and the average time from onset to puncture was 4.38 for tandem occlusions versus 4.53 hours in isolated anterior circulation occlusion (P = .704). Complication rates and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were comparable in both groups (5% versus 3%, P = .49). The duration of the procedure was significantly prolonged in case of tandem occlusion (80.69 versus 65.45 minutes, P = .030). Fourteen patients with carotid artery dissection (70%) had a 3-month mRS of ≤ 2, without a significant difference from patients with an isolated anterior circulation occlusion (44%, P = .2). Only 5 carotid artery dissections (25%) necessitated cervical stent placement. No early ipsilateral stroke recurrence was recorded, despite the absence of stent placement in 15 patients (75%) with carotid artery dissection. CONCLUSIONS Mechanical endovascular treatment of carotid artery dissection tandem occlusions is safe and effective compared with isolated anterior circulation occlusion stroke therapy. Hence, a more conservative approach with stent placement only in cases of circle of Willis insufficiency may be a reliable and safe strategy.","Marnat, G; Mourand, I; Eker, O; Machi, P; Arquizan, C; Riquelme, C; Ayrignac, X; Bonafé, A; Costalat, V",AJNR.

In a previous study, we have shown that histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) levels go up in macrophages infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and it hypoacetylates histone H3 at the promoter of IL-12B gene, leading to its downregulation. We now show that after infection with M. tuberculosis, HDAC1 is phosphorylated, and the levels of phosphorylated HDAC1 (pHDAC1) increase significantly in macrophages. We found that transcriptional repressor protein zinc finger and BTB domain 25 (ZBTB25) and transcriptional corepressor Sin3a associate with the HDAC1 silencing complex, which is recruited to the promoter of IL-12B to downregulate its expression in infected macrophages. Knocking down of ZBTB25 enhanced release of IL-12p40 from infected macrophages. Inhibition of HDAC1 and ZBTB25 promoted colocalization of M. tuberculosis and LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3) in autophagosomes. Induction of autophagy resulted in the killing of intracellular M. tuberculosis Enhanced phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT4 was observed in macrophages upon treatment with HDAC1 and ZBTB inhibitors, and inhibition of JAK2/STAT4 negated the killing of the intracellular pathogen, suggesting their role in the autophagy-mediated killing of intracellular M. tuberculosis In view of the emergence of drug resistance in M. tuberculosis, host-directed therapy is an attractive alternative strategy to combat tuberculosis (TB). HDACs have been proposed to be host targets for TB treatment. Our study indicates that ZBTB25, a functional subunit of the HDAC1/Sin3a repressor complex involved in IL-12B suppression, could be an alternative target for host-directed anti-TB therapy.IMPORTANCE Following infection with M. tuberculosis, levels of HDAC1 go up in macrophages, and it is recruited to the promoter of IL-12B where it hypoacetylates histone H3, leading to the downregulation of the gene. Here, we show that host transcriptional repressor protein ZBTB25 and transcriptional corepressor Sin3a associate with HDAC1 in the silencing complex. Knocking down of ZBTB25 prevented the recruitment of the complex to the promoter and consequently enhanced the gene expression and the release of IL-12p40 from infected macrophages. Pharmacological inhibition of ZBTB25 in infected macrophages resulted in the induction of autophagy and killing of intracellular M. tuberculosis Drug-resistant TB is a serious challenge to TB control programs all over the world which calls for finding alternative therapeutic methods. Host-directed therapy is gaining significant momentum in treating infectious diseases. We propose that ZBTB25 is a potential target for host-directed treatment of TB.","Madhavan, Aravind; Arun, K B; Pushparajan, Akhil Raj; Balaji, M; Kumar, Ramakrishnan Ajay",mSphere,142,29

Grading scales are available to aid the assessment of curative risk for microsurgery and radiosurgery. No grading system has been developed to assess the curative risk of endovascular surgery. OBJECTIVE To report our retrospective application of the AVM embocure score to patients treated at our institution between 2005 and 2011 METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 39 patients with CAVM treated at our institution between 2005 and 2011 with the primary aim of achieving a curative embolization. After reviewing all the different variables associated with the conventional Onyx embolization technique for CAVMs, we identified the following as the most relevant characteristics influencing the chances for complete angiographic embolization and complication risk: the number of arterial pedicles and draining veins, size of AVM nidus, and vascular eloquence. We sought to develop a scoring system to assess the complication risk for a curative embolization of CAVM with liquid embolic Onyx (Covidien, Irvine, California, USA). We developed the AVM embocure score (AVMES). This scoring system ranges from 3 to 10 and is the arithmetic sum of the number of arterial pedicles feeding the AVM (≤3, 4-6, >6), the number of draining veins (≤3, 4-6, >6), the size of the AVM nidus in centimeters (≤3, 4-6, >6), and the vascular eloquence (0-1). We applied AVMES to the same cohort of patients and validated the predictability of complete angiographic embolization and expected clinical risk of complication. RESULTS In lesions with an AVMES of 3 (n=8), there was a 100% rate of complete AVM obliteration and 0% rate of major complications. In AVMES 4 (n=12) lesions, there was 75% complete obliteration rate, with 8% major morbidity. In AVMES 5 (n=9) lesions, there was 78% complete obliteration and 11% major morbidity. In AVMES >5 (n=10) there was 20% complete obliteration and 30% major morbidity. Receiver-operator curve analysis showed that this scoring system was robust in its discriminative ability, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8356 for complete obliteration without complication, AUC=0.8240 for complete obliteration regardless of the presence of major morbidity, and AUC=0.7529 for major morbidity. CONCLUSIONS The AVMES complements existing scoring systems for microsurgery and radiosurgery. It provides a valuable tool for risk assessment during the complex decision-making process in treating AVMs that accounts for angioarchitectural features of particular relevance to endovascular surgeons.","Lopes, Demetrius K; Moftakhar, Roham; Straus, David; Munich, Stephan A; Chaus, Fahad; Kaszuba, Megan C",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,142,1

Of particular interest is the nonstructural NSs protein, which forms large filamentous fibril bundles in the nucleus. Past studies have shown NSs to be a multifaceted protein important for virulence through modulation of the interferon response as well acting as a general inhibitor of transcription. Here we investigated the regulation of the DNA damage signaling cascades by RVFV infection and found virally inducted phosphorylation of the classical DNA damage signaling proteins, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) (Ser-1981), Chk.2 (Thr-68), H2A.X (Ser-139), and p53 (Ser-15). In contrast, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) (Ser-428) phosphorylation was decreased following RVFV infection. Importantly, both the attenuated vaccine strain MP12 and the fully virulent strain ZH548 showed strong parallels in their up-regulation of the ATM arm of the DNA damage response and in the down-regulation of the ATR pathway. The increase in DNA damage signaling proteins did not result from gross DNA damage as no increase in DNA damage was observed following infection. Rather the DNA damage signaling was found to be dependent on the viral protein NSs, as an NSs mutant virus was not found to induce the equivalent signaling pathways. RVFV MP12-infected cells also displayed an S phase arrest that was found to be dependent on NSs expression. Use of ATM and Chk.2 inhibitors resulted in a marked decrease in S phase arrest as well as viral production. These results indicate that RVFV NSs induces DNA damage signaling pathways that are beneficial for viral replication.","Baer, Alan; Austin, Dana; Narayanan, Aarthi; Popova, Taissia; Kainulainen, Markus; Bailey, Charles; Kashanchi, Fatah; Weber, Friedemann; Kehn-Hall, Kylene",The Journal of biological chemistry,142,1

METHODS Cross-sectional population-based study, using secondary data from the National Health Survey (PNS) of 2013. The sample size was 2,969 elderly individuals. Latent Class Analysis was used to construct the dependent variable ""profile of dental service use"" from questions related to this profile. The independent variables formed 3 blocks: sociodemographic; comorbidities; functionalities and self-perception of oral health. The Rao-Scott Test and Standardized Residue Analysis tested the association. To measure the effect of covariates, Odds Ratio was estimated using a multiple hierarchical model of multinomial logistic regression. Significance level was 5%. RESULTS Three latent classes were identified: Direct Disbursement Profile, Health Plan Profile and the Unified Health System (SUS) Profile. White elderly people were associated with the Direct Disbursement and Health Plans profile. The Health Plan profile was more associated with the married marital status or living with a spouse. In the multiple model, low schooling was associated with the profile of SUS users and elderly people diagnosed with cancer with the Health Plan profile. Self-perceiving oral health as bad or very bad increased the chances of belonging to the SUS profile. CONCLUSION Latent Class Analysis proved to be a powerful strategy for a subtle and detailed understanding of the profile of dental service use and its relationship with associated factors.","Moreira, Rafael da Silveira; Mauricio, Herika de Arruda; Monteiro, Ive da Silva; Marques, Mônica Maria Motta Dos Reis",Revista brasileira de epidemiologia = Brazilian journal of epidemiology,142,25

It is anticipated that rationing of health care resources will be required, thus demanding that choices be made about which individuals should receive potentially life-saving care when not all who can be saved can be served. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION Most proposed triage and allocation plans have used medical inclusion and exclusion criteria to reduce this gap, but there will still be many more patients than resources. Thus, the potential to arbitrarily exclude groups of people on non-medical grounds in order to reduce relative scarcity could offer an attractive option. Can societies make reasoned anticipatory decisions to keep certain people from receiving influenza treatment in order to maximize the availability of care for other, more favored groups? RESULTS In this paper, we argue that taking the fundamental moral equality of people seriously requires the inclusion of vulnerable, socially marginalized groups (such as illegal immigrants and incarcerated prisoners) in planning for a pandemic. While there may be a majoritarian justification for a priori discrimination against some groups of people on non-medical grounds, there are no morally defensible reasons to do so and many reasons not to engage in such behavior. CONCLUSIONS Pandemic planners should resist attempts to institute either unsanctioned or authorized discrimination in resource allocation. Because of their unique position in society, their ethical code and their essential role in confronting a pandemic, physicians can (and should) defend egalitarianism in the allocation of health care resources in such a public health crisis and advocate and act against such exclusion were it to occur.","Rosoff, Philip M; DeCamp, Matthew",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,142,20

METHODS We implemented a comprehensive search strategy across three electronic databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid) and Embase (Ovid). All studies using time-series, retrospective, prospective, pre-post or cross-sectional study designs were included. Studies were required to examine suicide mortality as the outcome of interest. To help organise the results, studies were grouped into six broad categories of universal interventions consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan. A narrative synthesis of results was used to describe the findings. RESULTS Of the 15 641 studies identified through the search strategy, 100 studies were eligible in the following categories: law and regulation reforms (n=66), physical barriers (n=13), community-based interventions (n=9), communication strategies (n=4), mental health policies and strategies (n=7), and access to healthcare (n=1). Overall, 100% (13/13) of the included physical barrier interventions resulted in a significant reduction in suicide mortality. Although only 70% (46/66) of the law and regulation reform interventions had a significant impact on reducing suicide, they hold promise due to their extended reach. Universal suicide prevention interventions seem to be more effective at reducing suicide among males than females, identifying a need to stratify results by sex in future studies. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that universal suicide prevention interventions hold promise in effectively reducing suicide mortality in high-income OECD countries.","Ishimo, Marie-Claire; Sampasa-Kanyinga, Hugues; Olibris, Brieanne; Chawla, Mitulika; Berfeld, Noami; Prince, Stephanie A; Kaplan, Mark S; Orpana, Heather; Lang, Justin J",Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,142,16

To solve this problem, we have used a wet etching technique to fabricate 23 nm wide nanostructures randomly aligned as ridges on aluminum (Al) 6063 alloy surfaces. The surfaces were etched for 0.5, 1, and 3 h. The surfaces were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, contact angle goniometry, nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy. Strains of the Gram negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus were used to evaluate the bacterial attachment behavior. For the first time, common respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV), were investigated for antiviral activity on nanostructured surfaces. It was found that the etched Al surfaces were hydrophilic and the nanoscale roughness enhanced with the etching time with Rrms ranging from 69.9 to 995 nm. Both bacterial cells of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were physically deformed and were nonviable upon attachment after 3 h on the etched Al 6063 surface. This nanoscale surface topography inactivated 92 and 87% of the attached P. aeruginosa and S. aureus cells, respectively. The recovery of infectious RSV was also reduced significantly within 2 h of exposure to the nanostructured surfaces compared to the smooth Al control surfaces. There was a 3-4 log10 reduction in the viability counts of rhinovirus after 24 h on the nanostructured surfaces. The nanostructured surfaces exhibited excellent durability as the surfaces sustained 1000 cycles of 2000 μN load without any damage. This is the first report that has shown the combined antibacterial and antiviral property of the nanostructured surface with excellent nanomechanical properties that could be potentially significant for use in hospital environments to stop the spread of infections arising from physical surfaces.","Hasan, Jafar; Xu, Yanan; Yarlagadda, Tejasri; Schuetz, Michael; Spann, Kirsten; Yarlagadda, Prasad Kdv",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,142,27

Heat shock also triggers proteostasis factors to form subcellular quality control bodies, but the relationship between these spatial structures and the HSR is unclear. Here we show that localization of the J-protein Sis1, a cofactor for the chaperone Hsp70, controls HSR activation in yeast. Under nonstress conditions, Sis1 is concentrated in the nucleoplasm, where it promotes Hsp70 binding to the transcription factor Hsf1, repressing the HSR. Upon heat shock, Sis1 forms an interconnected network with other proteostasis factors that spans the nucleolus and the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. We propose that localization of Sis1 to this network directs Hsp70 activity away from Hsf1 in the nucleoplasm, leaving Hsf1 free to induce the HSR. In this manner, Sis1 couples HSR activation to the spatial organization of the proteostasis network.","Feder, Zoë A; Ali, Asif; Singh, Abhyudai; Krakowiak, Joanna; Zheng, Xu; Bindokas, Vytas P; Wolfgeher, Donald; Kron, Stephen J; Pincus, David",The Journal of cell biology,142,7

The presence of the MYD88 L265P mutation was significantly linked to advanced age, the presence of multiple brain lesions, and DLBCL molecular subtype. Multivariate analyses additionally confirmed that elevated TLR4 and p-STAT3 expression levels are associated with a poorer PCNSL patient prognosis.

Simultaneous intracolonic and intraabdominal CO(2) insufflation may result in significant physiologic changes, but in-depth physiologic effects have not been studied to date. This study aimed to evaluate the physiologic changes and the overall safety of simultaneous CO(2) laparoscopy and colonoscopy. METHODS A prospective pilot study was performed with 26 subjects (17 men and 9 women) undergoing laparoscopic surgical treatment for colorectal conditions adjunctively managed with CO(2) intraoperative colonoscopy. Surgery proceeded with CO(2) insufflation to a maximum pressure of 12 mmHg by laparoscopy and with a maximum CO(2) flow of 5 l/min via colonoscopy. Serial intra- and postoperative arterial blood gases, end-tidal CO(2), and minute ventilation were recorded during predetermined periods: during initial laparoscopy, during simultaneous colonoscopy and laparoscopy, during laparoscopy after colonoscopy, and after desufflation. RESULTS No significant morbidity resulted from simultaneous CO(2) insufflation. Three patients had a CO(2) partial pressure (PaCO(2)) greater than 50, and one patient with a body mass index (BMI) higher than 42 kg/m(2) had a PaCO(2) greater than 50 for more than 30 min and was compensated by increasing minute ventilation. The mean pH was 7.36 in the recovery room. Postoperatively, no patient had a pH lower than 7.3, prolonged intubation, or reintubation. CONCLUSION Simultaneous CO(2) colonoscopy and laparoscopy lead only to transient alterations in respiratory parameters that can be compensated. Based on these findings, simultaneous insufflation of CO(2) into the peritoneal cavity and the large bowel lumen during complex endoscopic procedures may be considered safe for most patients.","Trencheva, Koiana; Dhar, Panchali; Sonoda, Toyooki; Lee, Sang; Samuels, Jon; Stein, Brenna; Milsom, Jeffrey",Surgical endoscopy,142,31

DESIGN Multicentre, randomised controlled, endpoint blinded trial. SETTING Seven inpatient rehabilitation sites in Germany (2013-17). PARTICIPANTS 200 adults with subacute stroke (days 5-45 after stroke) with a median National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS, range 0-42 points, higher values indicating more severe strokes) score of 8 (interquartile range 5-12) were randomly assigned (1:1) to aerobic physical fitness training (n=105) or relaxation sessions (n=95, control group) in addition to standard care. INTERVENTION Participants received either aerobic, bodyweight supported, treadmill based physical fitness training or relaxation sessions, each for 25 minutes, five times weekly for four weeks, in addition to standard rehabilitation therapy. Investigators and endpoint assessors were masked to treatment assignment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcomes were change in maximal walking speed (m/s) in the 10 m walking test and change in Barthel index scores (range 0-100 points, higher scores indicating less disability) three months after stroke compared with baseline. Safety outcomes were recurrent cardiovascular events, including stroke, hospital readmissions, and death within three months after stroke. Efficacy was tested with analysis of covariance for each primary outcome in the full analysis set. Multiple imputation was used to account for missing values. RESULTS Compared with relaxation, aerobic physical fitness training did not result in a significantly higher mean change in maximal walking speed (adjusted treatment effect 0.1 m/s (95% confidence interval 0.0 to 0.2 m/s), P=0.23) or mean change in Barthel index score (0 (-5 to 5), P=0.99) at three months after stroke. A higher rate of serious adverse events was observed in the aerobic group compared with relaxation group (incidence rate ratio 1.81, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 3.36). CONCLUSIONS Among moderately to severely affected adults with subacute stroke, aerobic bodyweight supported, treadmill based physical fitness training was not superior to relaxation sessions for maximal walking speed and Barthel index score but did suggest higher rates of adverse events. These results do not appear to support the use of aerobic bodyweight supported fitness training in people with subacute stroke to improve activities of daily living or maximal walking speed and should be considered in future guidelines.

Fifty positive cats were included in the study, 16 of which were treated with doxycycline (orally, 5 mg/kg twice a day) while other 34 with oxytetracycline (intramuscular injection, 10 mg/kg once a day). It was determined that all (100%) cats with Mycoplasma spp. infection had a flea infestation. Majority of cats (94%) did not receive the regular antiparasitic application and only 6 (12%) of them had complete vaccinations. Mycoplasma spp. infection was associated with younger age and outdoor access. Among the feline breed, striped cat (74%) was more prone to infection. The most common clinical signs encountered in cats were weakness (94%) and anorexia (84%). Haematological parameters revealed thrombocytopenia (86%), and anaemia (40%) in infected cats. At the end of the treatment, recovery rates for doxycycline and oxytetracycline groups were 87.5% and 67.6%, respectively. General status of these cats indicated significant improvement on the 4th day of treatment, and clinical symptoms are restored on the th day. Mycoplasmosis is an important infection for cats having anaemia, thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis. Flea infestations are risk factor for contamination of the disease. Based on our results, we recommend doxycycline treatment (5 mg/kg) for up to 21 days for elimination of Mycoplasma spp. in the blood of infected cats.","Çetin, H S; Ekici, O; Küçükyildiz, F; Senlik, B",Tropical biomedicine,142,19

While myopia has been associated with scleral remodelling and changes in posterior scleral shape, there has been little research examining how myopia affects in-vivo anterior sclera shape. We compared anterior scleral shape in emmetropes, low to moderate myopes, and high myopes. METHODS In this prospective study, the Eye Surface Profiler instrument was used to quantify anterior eye surface shapes of forty-five young adult participants (58 % females) aged between 18 and 35 years, including 15 emmetropes, 15 low to moderate myopes, and 15 high myopes. Sagittal height and axial radius of curvature of regions over the nasal and temporal corneal periphery and anterior sclera were exported and analysed. RESULTS After quality control of the data, 39 and 43 subjects had data analysed from the nasal and temporal sides, respectively. The nasal sides of the surfaces of the corneal periphery and anterior sclera had greater sagittal height in high myopes than in emmetropes across all regions (mean sagittal heights 2.44 ± 0.07 and 2.21 ± 0.04 mm, respectively, p = 0.02), but no significant differences were found between low to moderate myopes with emmetropes or with high myopes. No significant refractive group differences occurred for temporal anterior eye surface height. High myopes' nasal-temporal asymmetry of sagittal height was less than of emmetropes (means 0.20 ± 0.07 and 0.46 ± 0.06 mm, respectively, p = 0.02). High myopes also exhibited less nasal-temporal axial radius of curvature asymmetry than emmetropes (mean 0.35 ± 0.08 and 0.71 ± 0.08 mm, respectively, p = 0.01) across all regions. CONCLUSIONS High myopes exhibited a different anterior eye surface shape than emmetropes, having greater sagittal height in the nasal corneal periphery and anterior sclera. There was less nasal-temporal asymmetry of sagittal height and axial radius of curvature in high myopes than in emmetropes. Asymmetric growth of the eye associated with myopia development may be the underlying reason. These findings have implications for design of contact lenses, particularly soft and larger rigid lenses such as mini-sclerals.","Niyazmand, Hamed; Read, Scott A; Atchison, David A; Collins, Michael J",Contact lens & anterior eye : the journal of the British Contact Lens Association,142,1

The pressure ulcer prevention program (PUPP) had a multifaceted approach and data were collected for a period of 5 years. The results showed a definite reduction in the incidences of HAPUs. Many such programs show similar positive results and echo many of the same considerations of risk, prevention strategies, and the need for early intervention. However, none of the other studies either replicate the hospital's PUPP nor the extent of the positive and lasting effect of the program. Eager to determine the contributing factor(s) in order that the project success could be continued and possibly replicated in other quality improvement projects, it was decided that an examination and comparison of other similar programs and their results would be necessary in order to uncover the answer.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute and short-term performance of the WEB II device regarding the immediacy, degree, and durability of aneurysm occlusion in two patients. METHODS The WEB II device was implanted in one patient with an unruptured MCA trifurcation aneurysm and one patient with an unruptured basilar tip aneurysm. The degree of intra-aneurysmal flow disruption was graded based on serial digital subtraction aneurysm angiography performed over 30 min immediately following device implantation and at 8 weeks. Immediate and 8-week post-treatment CT and 3-T MRI studies were also performed. RESULTS Delivery and deployment of the WEB II device was technically straightforward and achieved without complications. Neither device required retrieval or repositioning after full deployment. There were no peri-procedural thrombembolic or hemorrhagic complications. In both cases, complete aneurysm occlusion was observed within minutes of device deployment. Short-term angiographic follow-up confirmed stable complete occlusion at 8 weeks. CONCLUSION Early technical and clinical results from the first WEB II cases have been encouraging and suggest that the intra-saccular deployment of self-expanding, compliant, cylindrical, high-density, braided metallic mesh constructs may represent a feasible approach for the endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms.","Klisch, Joachim; Sychra, Vojtech; Strasilla, Christoph; Liebig, Thomas; Fiorella, David",Neuroradiology,142,33

The data were compared to the results of recently published thrombectomy trials (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, EXTEND-IA, SWIFT-PRIME, REVASCAT and THRACE). METHODS We retrospectively studied 246 patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent thrombectomy between January 2012 and December 2015 at the NMC in Upper Austria. The main outcome measures were modified Rankin scale (mRS) score 0-2 at 90 days, all-cause mortality and stroke or thrombectomy-related mortality at discharge, as well as 90 days postdischarge. RESULTS The median age was 70.4 years (IQR 59.9-76.9) and the median NIHSS at admission 16 (IQR 13-20). The thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) scale 2b-3 recanalization was achieved in 87.4%, 11.0% of the patients died in hospital and an additional 6.1% within 90 days after discharge. After 90 days, 56.5% had a mRS score 0-2. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that the positive results of thrombectomy reported in several randomized controlled studies can be achieved in routine clinical practice; therefore, the setting of an organized, regional stroke network proved an effective and appropriate method for delivering regional thrombectomy stroke treatment.","Stockinger, Maria Sophie; Trenkler, Johannes; von Oertzen, Tim; Nussbaumer, Karin; Sonnberger, Michael; Schimetta, Wolfgang; Pereira, Anthony C; Traxler, Gerhard; Dorninger, Claudia; Haring, Hans-Peter",Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,142,10

Little research, however, has explored the experiences of transgender individuals who have undergone nonsurgical injectable procedures (NSIPs). Objectives This study examined theoretically relevant psychosocial characteristics of transgender individuals who have and have not undergone NSIPs. Methods An online survey of demographic and psychosocial constructs was disseminated through transgender-specific support groups and Facebook groups from December 2019 to February 2020. Psychosocial measures included self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory), anticipated discrimination (Intersectional-Anticipated Discrimination), gender identity and physicality congruence (Transgender Congruence Scale), body image (Body Image Quality of Life Inventory), and overall satisfaction with facial appearance (FACE-Q Face Overall). The Mann-Whitney U test assessed differences by history of NSIPs, and the Kruskal-Wallis test assessed gender and racial differences. A P-value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results Participants (N = 101) were transfeminine (n = 58), transmasculine (n = 31), gender-diverse (n = 12), and mostly (71%) white. Almost two-thirds of respondents (62%) reported using NSIPs; 6 participants reported undergoing NSIPs from non-licensed providers. History of NSIPs was associated with greater self-esteem (P < 0.01), less anticipated discrimination (P < 0.01), greater physicality and gender identity congruence(P < 0.001), greater body image quality of life (P < 0.001), and greater satisfaction with overall facial appearance (P < 0.01). Conclusions Use of NSIPs was associated with more positive psychosocial symptoms. Experiences with NSIPs may play an important role in psychosocial functioning for transgender individuals.

This Position Statement from the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) is an attempt to homogenize recommendations and, hence, patient management according to the best scientific evidence and other considerations (e.g. health policy). A Working Group developed consensus statements, using the existing national guidelines as a starting point and considering new evidence in the literature. The Position Statement wishes to contribute to a more cost-effective approach to the care of patients with BE by reducing the number of surveillance endoscopies for patients with a low risk of malignant progression and centralizing care in expert centers for those with high progression rates.Main statements MS1 The diagnosis of BE is made if the distal esophagus is lined with columnar epithelium with a minimum length of 1 cm (tongues or circular) containing specialized intestinal metaplasia at histopathological examination. MS2 The ESGE recommends varying surveillance intervals for different BE lengths. For patients with an irregular Z-line/columnar-lined esophagus of < 1 cm, no routine biopsies or endoscopic surveillance is advised. For BE ≥ 1 cm and < 3 cm, BE surveillance should be repeated every 5 years. For BE ≥ 3 cm and < 10 cm, the interval for endoscopic surveillance should be 3 years. Patients with BE with a maximum extent ≥ 10 cm should be referred to a BE expert center for surveillance endoscopies. Patients with limited life expectancy and advanced age should be discharged from endoscopic surveillance. MS3 The diagnosis of any degree of dysplasia (including ""indefinite for dysplasia"") in BE requires confirmation by an expert gastrointestinal pathologist. MS4 Patients with visible lesions in BE diagnosed as dysplasia or early cancer should be referred to a BE expert center. All visible abnormalities, regardless of the degree of dysplasia, should be removed by means of endoscopic resection techniques in order to obtain optimal histopathological staging MS5 All patients with a BE ≥ 10 cm, a confirmed diagnosis of low grade dysplasia, high grade dysplasia (HGD), or early cancer should be referred to a BE expert center for surveillance and/or treatment. BE expert centers should meet the following criteria: annual case load of ≥10 new patients undergoing endoscopic treatment for HGD or early carcinoma per BE expert endoscopist; endoscopic and histological care provided by endoscopists and pathologists who have followed additional training; at least 30 supervised endoscopic resection and 30 endoscopic ablation procedures to acquire competence in technical skills, management pathways, and complications; multidisciplinary meetings with gastroenterologists, surgeons, oncologists, and pathologists to discuss patients with Barrett's neoplasia; access to experienced esophageal surgery; and all BE patients registered prospectively in a database.","Weusten, Bas; Bisschops, Raf; Coron, Emanuel; Dinis-Ribeiro, Mário; Dumonceau, Jean-Marc; Esteban, José-Miguel; Hassan, Cesare; Pech, Oliver; Repici, Alessandro; Bergman, Jacques; di Pietro, Massimiliano",Endoscopy,142,16

In vitro models of surface-attached biofilms do not always accurately mimic these processes. Here, we tested a new approach to create in vitro non-attached bacterial aggregates using the principle of magnetic levitation of biological objects placed into a magnetic field gradient. Bacteria grown under magnetic levitation conditions formed non-attached aggregates that were studied with CLSM and SEM and characterized quantitatively. Non-attached aggregates consisted of bacteria submerged into an extracellular matrix and demonstrated features characteristic of biofilms, such as polymeric matrix that binds Ruby Red and Congo red dyes, prerequisite of bacterial growth, and increased resistance to gentamicin. Three quantitative methods were explored to characterize strain-specific potential to form non-attached aggregates: geometric sizes, relative quantities of aggregated and free-swimming bacteria, and Congo red binding. A comparison of three E. coli strains demonstrated that the strain weakly forming non-attached aggregates differed from strains that formed aggregates based on all three parameters (p<0.05). Further, we characterized biofilm formation on plastic and agar surfaces by these strains and found that good biofilm formation ability does not necessarily indicate good non-attached aggregate formation ability, and vice versa. The model and quantitative methods can be applied for in vitro studies of non-attached aggregates and modeling bacterial behavior in chronic infections, as it is important to increase understanding of the role that non-attached bacterial aggregates play in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases.Importance paragraphAn increasing amount of evidence indicates that chronic infections are associated with non-attached biofilm-like aggregates formed by pathogenic bacteria. These aggregates differ from biofilms because they form under low-shear conditions within the volume of biological fluids and they do not attach to surfaces. Here, we describe an in vitro model that provides non-attached aggregate formation within the liquid volume due to magnetic levitation. Using this model, we demonstrated that despite morphological and functional similarities of non-attached aggregates and biofilms, strains that exhibit good biofilm formation might exhibit poor non-attached aggregate formation, suggesting that mechanisms underlying the formation of biofilms and non-attached aggregates are not identical. The magnetic levitation approach can be useful for in vitro studies of non-attached aggregate formation and simulation of bacterial behavior in chronic infections.","Domnin, Pavel; Arkhipova, Anastasiya; Petrov, Stanislav; Sysolyatina, Elena; Parfenov, Vladislav; Karalkin, Pavel; Mukhachev, Andrey; Gusarov, Alexey; Moisenovich, Mikhail; Khesuani, Yusef; Ermolaeva, Svetlana",Applied and environmental microbiology,142,19

The expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in COVID-19, thereby suppressing immune responses, has been described as responsible for the severity of the disease, but the correlation between MDSC subsets and COVID-19 severity remains elusive. Therefore, we classified patients according to clinical and laboratory findings - aiming to investigate the relationship between MDSC subsets and laboratory findings such as high C-reactive protein, ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase levels, which indicate the severity of the disease. Forty-one patients with COVID-19 (26 mild and 15 severe; mean age of 49.7 ± 15 years) and 26 healthy controls were included in this study. MDSCs were grouped into two major subsets - polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) and monocytic MDSCs - by flow cytometric immunophenotyping, and PMN-MDSCs were defined as mature and immature, according to CD16 expressions, for the first time in COVID-19. Total MDSCs, PMN-MDSCs, mature PMN-MDSCs and monocytic MDSCs were significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 compared to the healthy controls (P < 0.05). Only PMN-MDSCs and their immature PMN-MDSC subsets were higher in the severe subgroup than in the mild subgroup. In addition, a significant correlation was found between C-reactive protein, ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase levels and MDSCs in patients with COVID-19. These findings suggest that MDSCs play a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, while PMN-MDSCs, especially immature PMN-MDSCs, are associated with the severity of the disease.","Emsen, Ayca; Sumer, Sua; Tulek, Baykal; Cizmecioglu, Hilal; HusamettinVatansev,; Goktepe, Mevlut Hakan; Kanat, Fikret; Koksal, Yavuz; Arslan, Ugur; Artac, Hasibe",Scandinavian journal of immunology,142,5

This study aimed to investigate donors' awareness, attitudes and compliance with the two-phased policy implementation of time-limited deferral for men who have sex with men (MSM) in Hong Kong. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three rounds of questionnaire survey were conducted between July 2017 and June 2019 covering the periods of pre-implementation (Round A), post-implementation without and with pre-donation questionnaire revision (Round B and C). Chi-square test and multivariable regression analysis were performed. RESULTS Of 3085 donors recruited, 968, 1036 and 1081 completed the surveys in Round A, B and C, respectively. The non-compliance rate of MSM remained stable at 0·6% (3/497), 0·4% (2/551) and 0·5% (3/587) among male donors in Round A, B and C, respectively. Two MSM donors from Round C complying with the prevailing policy were identified. About two-thirds (60·7%) of respondents from Round B and C were unaware of the policy change. Overall, over 80% were either neutral or positive about the change. CONCLUSION Our study showed a consistently low non-compliance rate of MSM over the three periods. The generally high level of acceptance of time-limited deferral among donors lends support to science-based policy development to protect blood safety. The identification of compliant MSM donors suggests that the 12-month deferral is effective and acceptable to MSM. With a deferral period far exceeding the window period, it is a step towards a more equitable policy.","Lau, Janice Ying-Chui; Lee, Cheuk-Kwong; Chan, Chin-Pok; Leung, Jennifer Ngar-Sze; Poon, Chin-Man; Lee, Shui-Shan",Vox sanguinis,142,25

A teleproctoring concept using optical see-through head-mounted displays with a proctor's ability to see and, more important, virtually interact in the operator's visual field is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS Test conditions were created for simulated proctoring using a bifurcation aneurysm flow model for WEB device deployment. The operator in the angiography suite wore a Magic Leap-1 optical see-through head-mounted display to livestream his or her FOV to a proctor's computer in an adjacent building. A Web-based application (Spatial) was used for the proctor to virtually interact in the operator's visual space. Tested elements included the quality of the livestream, communication, and the proctor's ability to interact in the operator's environment using mixed reality. A hotspot and a Wi-Fi-based network were tested. RESULTS The operator successfully livestreamed the angiography room environment and his FOV of the monitor to the remotely located proctor. The proctor communicated and guided the operator through the procedure over the optical see-through head-mounted displays, a process that was repeated several times. The proctor used mixed reality and virtual space sharing to successfully project images, annotations, and data in the operator's FOV for highlighting any device or procedural aspects. The livestream latency was 0.71 (SD, 0.03) seconds for Wi-Fi and 0.86 (SD, 0.3) seconds for the hotspot (P = .02). The livestream quality was subjectively better over the Wi-Fi.

Such collections arise, for example, in evolutionary studies. Split networks can be viewed as a generalization of phylogenetic trees and may be generated using the SplitsTree package. Recently, the NeighborNet method for generating split networks has become rather popular, in part because it is guaranteed to always generate a circular split system, which can always be displayed by a planar split network. Even so, labels must be placed on the “outside” of the network, which might be problematic in some applications. To help circumvent this problem, it can be helpful to consider so-called flat split systems, which can be displayed by planar split networks where labels are allowed on the inside of the network too. Here, we present a new algorithm that is guaranteed to compute a minimal planar split network displaying a flat split system in polynomial time, provided the split system is given in a certain format. We will also briefly discuss two heuristics that could be useful for analyzing phylogeographic data and that allow the computation of flat split systems in this format in polynomial time.","Spillner, Andreas; Nguyen, Binh T; Moulton, Vincent",IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,142,16

Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP)-guided HF management using the CardioMEMS™ HF system was shown to be safe and reduce HF hospitalisation (HFH) rates in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III patients. However, these findings have not been replicated in health systems outside the United States. Therefore, the CardioMEMS European Monitoring Study for Heart Failure (MEMS-HF) evaluated the safety, feasibility, and performance of this device in Germany, The Netherlands, and Ireland. METHODS AND RESULTS 234 NYHA class III patients (68±11 years, 22% female, ≥1 HFH in the preceding year) from 31 centres were implanted with a CardioMEMS sensor and underwent PAP-guided HF management. One-year rates (95% confidence interval [CI]) of freedom from device-/system-related complications and from sensor failure (co-primary outcomes) were 98.3% (95.8-100.0) and 99.6% (97.6-100.0), respectively. Survival rate was 86.2%. For the 12 months post- versus pre-implant, HFHs decreased by 62% (0.60 vs. 1.55 events/patient-year; hazard ratio 0.38 [95% CI 0.31-0.48], P<0.0001). After 12 months, mean PAP decreased by 5.1±7.4 mmHg, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ] Overall/Clinical Summary Scores increased from 47.0±24.0/51.2±24.8 to 60.5±24.3/62.4±24.1 (P<0.0001), and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire sum-score improved from 8.7±5.9 to 6.3±5.1 (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION Haemodynamic-guided HF management proved feasible and safe in the health systems of Germany, The Netherlands, and Ireland. Physician-directed treatment modifications based on remotely obtained PAP values were associated with fewer HFH, sustainable PAP decreases, marked KCCQ improvements, and remission of depressive symptoms.

Magnetoionic approaches appear particularly promising, electrolytes and ionic conductors being capable of on/off control of ferromagnetism and tuning of magnetic anisotropy. A clear limitation, however, is that these devices either electrically tune a known ferromagnet or electrically induce ferromagnetism from another magnetic state, e.g., antiferromagnetic. Here, we demonstrate that ferromagnetism can be voltage-induced even from a diamagnetic (zero-spin) state suggesting that useful magnetic phases could be electrically induced in ""nonmagnetic"" materials. We use ionic liquid-gated diamagnetic FeS2 as a model system, showing that as little as 1 V induces a reversible insulator-metal transition by electrostatic surface inversion. Anomalous Hall measurements then reveal electrically tunable surface ferromagnetism at up to 25 K. Density functional theory-based modeling explains this in terms of Stoner ferromagnetism induced via filling of a narrow e g band.","Walter, Jeff; Voigt, Bryan; Day-Roberts, Ezra; Heltemes, Kei; Fernandes, Rafael M; Birol, Turan; Leighton, Chris",Science advances,142,5

Objective To assess the complications, safety, and timing of tracheotomy performed for critically ill patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective cohort study assessed consecutive patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) who had COVID-19 that required tracheotomy. Patients were recruited from March 16 to April 10, 2020, at a tertiary referral center. Exposures A surgical tracheotomy was performed for all patients following recommended criteria for use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Main Outcomes and Measures The number of subthyroid operations, the tracheal entrance protocol, and use of PPE. Infections among the surgeons were monitored weekly by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swab samples. Short-term complications, weaning, and the association of timing of tracheotomy (early [≤10 days] vs late [>10 days]) with total required days of invasive ventilation were assessed. Results A total of 50 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.8 [9.2] years; 33 [66%] male) participated in the study. All tracheotomies were performed at the bedside. The median time from intubation to tracheotomy was 9 days (interquartile range, 2-24 days). A subthyroid approach was completed for 46 patients (92%), and the tracheal protocol was adequately achieved for 40 patients (80%). Adequate PPE was used, with no infection among surgeons identified 4 weeks after the last tracheotomy. Postoperative complications were rare, with minor bleeding (in 6 patients [12%]) being the most common complication. The successful weaning rate was higher in the early tracheotomy group than in the late tracheotomy group (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.55; 95% CI, 0.96-6.75), but the difference was not statistically significant. There was less time of invasive mechanical ventilatory support with early tracheotomy compared with late tracheotomy (mean [SD], 18 [5.4] vs 22.3 [5.7] days). The reduction of invasive ventilatory support was achieved at the expense of the pretracheotomy period. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, with the use of a standardized protocol aimed at minimizing COVID-19 risks, bedside open tracheotomy was a safe procedure for patients and surgeons, with minimal complications. Timing of tracheotomy may be important in reducing time of invasive mechanical ventilation, with potential implications to intensive care unit availability during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Avilés-Jurado, Francesc Xavier; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel; González-Sánchez, Nesly; de Ossó, José; Arancibia, Claudio; Rojas-Lechuga, María Jesús; Ruiz-Sevilla, Laura; Remacha, Joan; Sánchez, Irene; Lehrer-Coriat, Eduardo; López-Chacón, Mauricio; Langdon, Cristóbal; Guilemany, Josep María; Larrosa, Francisco; Alobid, Isam; Bernal-Sprekelsen, Manuel; Castro, Pedro; Vilaseca, Isabel",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,142,27

METHODS We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature (2005 to August 2013) with PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library, reviewed references of retrieved articles, and contacted manufactures to identify studies assessing the accuracy of noninvasive Hb monitoring against central laboratory Hb measurements. Two independent reviewers assessed the quality of studies using recommendations for reporting guidelines and quality criteria for method comparison studies. Pooled mean difference and standard deviation (SD) (95% limits of agreement) across studies were calculated using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I statistic. RESULTS A total of 32 studies (4425 subjects, median sample size of 44, ranged from 10 to 569 patients per study) were included in this meta-analysis. The overall pooled random-effects mean difference (noninvasive-central laboratory) and SD were 0.10 ± 1.37 g/dL (-2.59 to 2.80 g/dL, I = 95.9% for mean difference and 95.0% for SD). In subgroup analysis, pooled mean difference and SD were 0.39 ± 1.32 g/dL (-2.21 to 2.98 g/dL, I = 93.0%, 71.4%) in 13 studies conducted in the perioperative setting and were -0.51 ± 1.59 g/dL (-3.63 to 2.62 g/dL, I = 83.7%, 96.4%) in 5 studies performed in the intensive care unit setting. CONCLUSIONS Although the mean difference between noninvasive Hb and central laboratory measurements was small, the wide limits of agreement mean clinicians should be cautious when making clinical decisions based on these devices.","Kim, Sang-Hyun; Lilot, Marc; Murphy, Linda Suk-Ling; Sidhu, Kulraj S; Yu, Zhaoxia; Rinehart, Joseph; Cannesson, Maxime",Anesthesia and analgesia,142,28

The need is now being realized for newer innovations to further reduce the trauma of surgical access. We report our experience and outcome of the first case series of single-port access adrenalectomy by using SILS™ port. METHODS Between June 2009 and November 2010, 6 patients with adrenal tumors underwent single-port access adrenalectomy via SILS port. The device was placed through a single 3 cm incision. The patients' demographics, adrenal mass characteristics, operative time, conversion rate, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and postoperative pain score were measured. Five patients underwent adrenalectomy by using the retroperitoneal approach and 1 by using the laparoscopic transperitoneal approach. RESULTS Three men and 3 women with mean age 51 years (range, 37-67) underwent single-incision adrenalectomy. The mean tumor size was 3.3 cm (range, 1.5-6). Three of these cases were Conn's syndrome, and the remaining 3 were incidentaloma. No significant complications or conversions to the conventional procedure were recorded. The mean operative time was 121 minutes (range, 70-165). The mean hospital stay was 2.7 days (range, 2-4). No local recurrences or hormonal relapse have been recorded to the present with a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 3-20).

It functions by filling the fistula tract with an acellular crosslinked porcine dermal collagen matrix suspension. The MASERATI 100 study group was set up to evaluate the clinical outcome of Permacol paste in the treatment of anorectal fistula. This paper reports the results from the initial 30 patients enrolled in the MASERATI 100 prospective, observational clinical trial. METHOD Patients (N = 30) with anal fistula presenting to 10 European academic surgical units were treated with a sphincter-preserving technique using Permacol paste. Fistula healing was assessed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment, with the primary end-point of fistula healing at 6 months post-surgery. Faecal continence and patient satisfaction were recorded at each follow-up visit and adverse events were monitored throughout the follow-up. RESULTS Of the 28 patients with data at 6 months post-surgery, 15 (54%) were healed, and the healing rate was maintained at 12 months. Healing after treatment with Permacol paste was similar for intersphincteric to transsphincteric fistulae and primary or recurrent fistulae. Only one patient exhibited an adverse event (perianal abscess) that was possibly related to the treatment. At the last outpatient visit, over 60% of patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the operation. CONCLUSION Permacol paste is shown to be effective in treating primary and recurrent cryptoglandular anorectal fistula with minimal unwanted side effects.","Giordano, P; Sileri, P; Buntzen, S; Stuto, A; Nunoo-Mensah, J; Lenisa, L; Singh, B; Thorlacius-Ussing, O; Griffiths, B; Ziyaie, D",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,142,24

METHODS Data were analyzed for 874 patients operated on between January 1993 and May 2010 in 3 different surgical departments. RESULTS The median preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 52 kg/m² (range, 35-63). Comorbidities present were hypertension (57%), hypercholesterolemia (87%), hypertriglyceridemia (53%), type 2 diabetes (35%), and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS; 9%). The mean follow-up was 11.9 ± 3.1 years. The median BMI decreased to 33.9 after 1 year from bariatric surgery, 31.1 after 2-5 years, 30.9 after 5-10 years, and 31.2 kg/m² after 10-15 years. Overall, 67% of diabetic patients were able to stop insulin and 97% were able to stop oral hypoglycemic drugs within 1 year.

It is important to determine how relationships between key outcomes, specifically loneliness and depressive symptoms, manifest over a brief timeframe and in a pandemic context. METHOD Data was gathered over 4 months (March - June 2020) using an online survey with three repeated measures at monthly intervals (N = 1958; 69.8% females; Age 18-87 years, M = 37.01, SD = 12.81). Associations between loneliness, depression symptoms, and emotion regulation difficulty were tested using Pearson's product moment correlations, and descriptive statistics were calculated for all study variables. Cross-lagged structural equation modelling was used to examine the temporal relationships between variables. RESULTS The longitudinal association between loneliness and depressive symptoms was reciprocal. Loneliness predicted higher depressive symptoms one month later, and depressive symptoms predicted higher loneliness one month later. The relationship was not mediated by emotion regulation difficulties. Emotion regulation difficulties and depressive symptoms were also reciprocally related over time. LIMITATIONS Limitations include the reliance on self-report data and the non-representative sample. There was no pre-pandemic assessment limiting the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the mental health impact of the COVID-19 crisis. CONCLUSIONS Loneliness should be considered an important feature of case conceptualisation for depression during this time. Clinical efforts to improve mental health during the pandemic could focus on interventions that target either loneliness, depression, or both.

There is also evidence that antipsychotic (AP) treatment may induce binge eating or other related compulsive eating behaviours. It is therefore possible that abnormal eating patterns may contribute to the significant weight gain and other metabolic disturbances observed in patients with psychosis. In this scoping review, we aimed to explore the underlying psychopathological and neurobiological mechanisms of disrupted eating behaviours in psychosis spectrum disorders and the role of APs in this relationship. A systematic search identified 35 studies that met our eligibility criteria and were included in our qualitative synthesis. Synthesizing evidence from self-report questionnaires and food surveys, we found that patients with psychosis exhibit increased appetite and craving for fatty food, as well as increased caloric intake and snacking, which may be associated with increased disinhibition. Limited evidence from neuroimaging studies suggested that AP-naïve first episode patients exhibit similar neural processing of food to healthy controls, while chronic AP exposure may lead to decreased activity in satiety areas and increased activity in areas associated with reward anticipation. Overall, this review supports the notion that AP use can lead to disturbed eating patterns in patients, which may contribute to AP-induced weight gain. However, intrinsic illness-related effects on eating behaviors remain less well elucidated, and many confounding factors as well as variability in study designs limits interpretation of existing literature in this field and precludes firm conclusions from being made.","Stogios, Nicolette; Smith, Emily; Asgariroozbehani, Roshanak; Hamel, Laurie; Gdanski, Alexander; Selby, Peter; Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Graff-Guerrero, Ariel; Taylor, Valerie H; Agarwal, Sri Mahavir; Hahn, Margaret K",Nutrients,142,28

To maintain and improve the quality of care for people with mental illness, there is a need to understand how to effectively incorporate technologies into the delivery of compassionate mental health care. The objectives of this scoping review are to: (1) identify the digital technologies currently being used among patients and health professionals in the delivery of mental health care; (2) determine how these digital technologies are being used in the context of the delivery of compassionate care and (3) uncover the barriers to, and facilitators of, digital technology-driven delivery of compassionate mental health care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Searches were conducted of five databases, consisting of relevant articles published in English between 1990 and 2019. Identified articles will be independently screened for eligibility by two reviewers, first at a title and abstract stage, and then at a full-text level. Data will be extracted and compiled from eligible articles into a data extraction chart. Information collected will include a basic overview of the publication including the article title, authors, year of publication, country of origin, research design and research question addressed. On completion of data synthesis, the authors will conduct a consultation phase with relevant experts in the field. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required for this scoping review. With regards to the dissemination plan, principles identified from the relevant articles may be presented at conferences and an article will be published in an academic journal with study results. The authors also intend to engage interested mental health professionals, health professional educators and patients in a discussion about the study findings and implications for the future.","Strudwick, Gillian; Zhang, Timothy; Inglis, Fiona; Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Munnery, Mikayla; Lo, Brian; Singh Takhar, Shuranjeet; Charow, Rebecca; Wiljer, David",BMJ open,142,1

BACKGROUND Transcatheter occlusion relying on X-ray imaging has become the treatment of choice for patients with patent ductus arteriosus. Interventionists now work hard to minimise radiation exposure in order to reduce risk of induced cancers. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive children who underwent transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus from January 2012 to January 2016. Clinical data, anatomical characteristics, and catheterisation procedure parameters were reported. Radiation doses were analysed for the following variables: total air kerma, mGy; dose area product, Gy.cm2; dose area product per body weight, Gy.cm2/kg; and total fluoroscopic time. RESULTS A total of 324 patients were included (median age=1.51 [Q1-Q3: 0.62-4.23] years; weight=10.3 [6.7-17.0] kg). In all, 322/324 (99.4%) procedures were successful. The median radiation doses were as follows: total air kerma: 26 (14.5-49.3) mGy; dose area product: 1.01 (0.56-2.24) Gy.cm2; dose area product/kg: 0.106 (0.061-0.185) Gy.cm2/kg; and fluoroscopic time: 2.8 (2-4) min. In multivariate analysis, a weight >10 kg, a ductus arteriosus width <2 mm, complications during the procedure, and a high frame rate (15 frames/second) were risk factors for an increased exposure.

We performed a systematic review including a case report on this subject with the primary objective of identifying the total number of cases in the literature. The secondary objective was to assess median survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS A 59-year-old woman presented to our institution with anal incontinence to mucus leakage. Flexible sigmoidoscopy identified a carpet adenoma from the dentate line to the rectosigmoid junction. An abdomino-perineal resection (APR) was performed using the transanal total mesorectal excision technique (TaTME). No adjuvant chemotherapy was offered. Twenty-one months following the operation a stomal recurrence was identified. Palliative radiotherapy was commenced and the patient is alive 6 months later with no visible recurrence at the site of the stoma. A systematic review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS The systematic review identified 19 individual cases of either metachronous or true metastatic recurrence, including our own case. Median survival was 30 months in the 8 cases where further treatment was offered and accepted. CONCLUSION Stomal metastases or metachronous colorectal cancer is uncommon. The causes for this pattern of spread are not clear. Long-term survival from cutaneous recurrence is generally poor. For carefully selected patients, redo surgery is an option with satisfactory results.","Davey, Simon; McCarthy, Kathryn",In vivo,142,1

We investigated the cognitive and socio-cognitive profiles of patients with severe OSA, controlling for potentially relevant mediating variables (i.e. age, body-mass index, cognitive reserve and depression). Moreover, we studied the neuropsychological profile of a high-risk OSA phenotype characterized by severe OSA and severe nocturnal hypoxemia.Method: We assessed 29 previously untreated severe OSA patients with a mean age of 55.6 (± 9.9 years) and a mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 53.1 (± 17.4). A control group of 34 healthy participants was also enrolled. Participants completed an extensive neuropsychological battery that included social cognition, a relatively new investigation area among OSA patients.Data analysis: Data were analyzed with a Bayesian approach. Specifically, Bayesian ANCOVA was used to investigate whether the grouping variable could predict test performance. Age, body-mass index, cognitive reserve and state of depression were added as covariates to the null model to weight the effects of these potential confounding factors. Three groups were analyzed: healthy controls (H), OSA with severe apnea and severe nocturnal oxygen desaturation (D+), and OSA with severe apnea non-desaturators (D-). Performances on the various neuropsychological tests were treated as the dependent variables.Results: The results indicate that non-verbal reasoning, the theory of mind skills, and mental shifting ability were impaired in OSA patients. Patients with severe nocturnal hypoxemia underperformed compared to patients with the same severity of apnea but non-desaturators. Additionally, we observed a trend toward a worse performance among OSA desaturator patients in the following abilities: constructional ability, short term verbal memory, phonological fluency, and the ability to inhibit automatic and dominant responses.Conclusion: The data suggest a key role of hypoxemia in affecting cognitive functioning in OSA patients. Executive functions and the concomitant involvement of social cognition are particularly affected.","Macchitella, Luigi; Romano, Daniele Luigi; Marinelli, Chiara Valeria; Toraldo, Domenico Maurizio; Arigliani, Michele; De Benedetto, Michele; Angelelli, Paola",Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,142,12

Socket misalignments and permanent deformations reduce the comfort of the amputee. In order to forestall such issues, sufficient information about the socket lifespan needs to be acquired, which is fairly difficult given the lack of calculation methods that estimate the fatigue life in the literature. In this paper a semi-analytical model is proposed based on experimental results. It highlights the effects of the amputee average daily walking time on the socket fatigue life. A proportionality relationship is demonstrated linking the Burgers model parameters at the structural scale to those at the macroscopic scale. Hence, it becomes possible to evaluate the permanent deformation that induces a misalignment in the socket. These results are useful for the designers to predict the fatigue life of the socket, and also for clinicians to monitor the mechanical degradation of the trans-tibial socket and schedule maintenance or replacement.","Mankai, Wahbi; Ben Smida, Brahim; Chafra, Moez; Ben Cheikh, Ridha","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

MS appears not to be a risk factor for severe adverse COVID-19 outcomes (though patients with advanced disability or a progressive phenotype are at higher risk). Disease-modifying therapy (DMT)-based care appears generally safe for patients with MS who develop COVID-19 (although there may be an increased risk of adverse outcomes with anti-CD20 therapy). Interferon-β, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab and cladribine tablets are unlikely to increase the risk of infection; fingolimod, anti-CD20 agents and alemtuzumab may confer an intermediate risk. Existing DMT therapy should be continued at this time. For patients requiring initiation of a DMT, all currently available DMTs except alemtuzumab can be started safely at this time; initiate alemtuzumab subject to careful individual risk-benefit considerations. Patients should receive vaccination against COVID-19 where possible, with no interruption of existing DMT-based care. There is no need to alter the administration of interferon-β, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, fingolimod or cladribine tablets for vaccination; new starts on other DMTs should be delayed for up to 6 weeks after completion of vaccination to allow the immune response to develop. Doses of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine may be scheduled around doses of anti-CD20 or alemtuzumab. Where white cell counts are suppressed by treatment, these should be allowed to recover before vaccination.","Inshasi, Jihad; Alroughani, Raed; Al-Asmi, Abdullah; Alkhaboury, Jaber; Alsalti, Abdullah; Boshra, Amir; Canibano, Beatriz; Deleu, Dirk; Ahmed, Samar Farouk; Shatila, Ahmed; Thakre, Mona",Neurology and therapy,142,1

Droplet formation occurs at the gas-liquid line and between 20 and 60 bar above the Widom line, the corresponding borderline identified as the Frenkel line. The droplets start to form spheres of constant radius of ≈ 45 Å and transform into rods and globules at higher pressure. Droplet formation represents a liquid-liquid (polymorphic) phase transition of the same composition but different density, whose difference defines its order parameter.

RECENT FINDINGS Direct infection of the kidney by SARS-CoV-2 is not common, and convincing morphologic evidence of substantive kidney infection by SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. Severe COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury is likely multifactorial and results from the physiologic disturbances and therapies used to treat this illness. COVID-19-associated collapsing glomerulopathy (COVAN) is seen almost exclusively in patients with apolipoprotein L1 high-risk genotypes with no evidence of direct infection of the kidney by SARS-CoV-2. SUMMARY The prevailing evidence does not support substantive or persistent infection of kidneys in COVID-19 and indirect means of tissue injury are favored, although a 'hit and run' model cannot be excluded. COVAN frequently occurs in patients with mild respiratory systems, suggesting that innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide the second hit needed for the development of collapsing glomerulopathy in susceptible individuals.","Smith, Kelly D; Akilesh, Shreeram",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,142,33

Resilience has been identified as a mitigating factor for adverse mental health outcomes. Schools have shown an increasing interest in strategies to support students' mental health. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a school-based 1:1 health coaching program designed to build resilience by teaching students coping skills and strategies to increase their self-efficacy. STUDY DESIGN Single group intervention study with pre/post measures. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS Sixth grade students (aged 11-12 years) attending an urban middle school. INTERVENTION Youth participated in up to 6 resiliency-focused, 1:1 health coaching sessions completed over 8 weeks and conducted during the school day. Health coaches utilized motivational interviewing techniques to set and work toward resilience-related goals focused on improving coping skills and self-efficacy with youth during the intervention (January through March 2020). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The Child and Youth Resilience Measure-Revised and other mental health assessments were completed at baseline and immediately following completion of the intervention to evaluate outcomes. Paired sample t-tests and Hedges' g effect sizes were conducted to evaluate intervention effectiveness. Student participation rates were assessed throughout the intervention. RESULTS 287 youth participated in the study (87% participation rate) and participated in over 85% of health coaching sessions offered. A paired samples t-test revealed the youth resilience significantly increased from pre (M = 75.7, SD = 6.9) to post (M = 77.6, SD = 6.8) intervention (t[257] = 3.73, p < .001) and the size of the effect was medium (g = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.11, 0.46). CONCLUSIONS The findings demonstrate that health coaching can be an effective strategy for improving resiliency in youth. Future studies evaluating how to effectively disseminate this intervention strategy are planned.","Lee, Joey A; Heberlein, Erin; Pyle, Emily; Caughlan, Thomas; Rahaman, Darvi; Sabin, Margaret; Kaar, Jill L",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,142,1

DESIGN A cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire for HCWs during the summer and fall of 2005. SETTING Primary and emergency care clinics at 5 medical centers in King County, Seattle, Washington. RESULTS Nurse professionals who reported receiving training (odds ratio [OR], 2.5 [confidence interval {CI}, 1.1-5.9]; P=.029), instructional feedback from supervisors (OR, 3.0 [CI, 1.5-5.9]; P=.002), and management support for implementing safe work practices had a higher odds of also reporting adherence to recommended respiratory precautions, compared with nurses who did not. Training was the only important determinant for adherence to respiratory precaution measures among medical practitioners (OR, 5.5 [CI, 1.2-25.8]; P=.031). The reported rate of adherence to hand hygiene practices was higher among nurse professionals who were male (OR, 2.2 [CI, 1.0-4.9]; P=.045), had infants, small children, or older adults living at home (OR, 2.2 [CI, 1.2-3.9]; P=.007), reported cleanliness and orderliness of the establishment where they worked (OR, 2.0 [CI, 1.1-3.5]; P=.019), had received respiratory-infection control training (OR, 3.2 [CI, 1.8-6.0]; P<.001), and reported fears about catching a dangerous respiratory infection at work (OR, 2.3 [CI, 1.2-4.5]; P=.011). CONCLUSION A number of HCW and work-site characteristics associated with HCWs' use of recommended respiratory-infection control measures have been identified. These potentially influential characteristics should be considered as targets or guides for further investigation, which should include the evaluation of intervention strategies.","Turnberg, Wayne; Daniell, William; Simpson, Terri; Van Buren, Jude; Seixas, Noah; Lipkin, Edward; Duchin, Jeffery",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,142,5

The aim of the present study was to report our experience treating basilar apex aneurysms with flow-diverter stents and to evaluate their efficacy and safety profile in this specific anatomic condition. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed data from all consecutive patients treated with flow-diverter stents at our institution between January 2011 and January 2015. Patients with large basilar apex aneurysms treated with a flow-diverter stent were included in the study. Clinical presentations, technical details, intra- and perioperative complications, and clinical and angiographic outcomes were recorded, with a midterm follow-up. RESULTS Of the 175 aneurysms treated with flow-diverter stents at our institution, 5 patients (2 women and 3 men; age range, 44-58 years) received flow-diverter stent for basilar apex aneurysms. The mean follow-up after stent deployment was 21 months (range, 15-24 months). One patient died on day 31 from an early postprocedural midbrain hemorrhage. One patient had a right cerebellar hemispheric ischemic lesion with a transient cerebellar syndrome resolved within 24 hours without neurologic sequelae at the latest follow-up. The mRS was 0 in 4 patients and 6 in 1 patient at last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Flow diversion is a feasible technique with an efficacy demonstrated at a midterm follow-up, especially in the case of basilar apex aneurysm recurrences after previous endovascular treatments. Concern about its safety profile still exists.","Da Ros, V; Caroff, J; Rouchaud, A; Mihalea, C; Ikka, L; Moret, J; Spelle, L",AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology,142,1

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of linear stapled reconstruction in terms of anastomotic-related complications for EJS in TLTG. METHODS We collected data on 829 consecutive gastric cancer patients who underwent TLTG reconstructed by the Roux-en-Y method with radical lymphadenectomy between January 2010 and December 2016 in 13 hospitals. The patients were divided into two groups according to reconstruction method and matched by propensity score. Postoperative EJS-related complications were compared between the linear stapler (LS) and the circular stapler (CS) groups. RESULTS After matching, data from 196 patients in each group were analyzed. The overall incidence of EJS-related complications was significantly lower in the LS group than in the CS group (4.1% vs. 11.7%, p = 0.008). The incidence of EJS anastomotic stenosis during the first year after surgery was significantly lower in the LS group than in the CS group (1.5% vs. 7.1%, p = 0.011). The incidence of EJS bleeding did not differ significantly between the groups, although no bleeding was observed in the LS group (0% vs. 2.0%, p = 0.123). The incidence of EJS leakage did not differ significantly between the groups (2.6% vs. 3.6%, p = 0.771). CONCLUSION The use of linear stapled reconstruction is safer than the use of circular stapled reconstruction for intracorporeal EJS in TLTG because of its lower risks of stenosis.","Murakami, Katsuhiro; Obama, Kazutaka; Tsunoda, Shigeru; Hisamori, Shigeo; Nishigori, Tatsuto; Hida, Koya; Kanaya, Seiichiro; Satoh, Seiji; Manaka, Dai; Yamamoto, Michihiro; Kadokawa, Yoshio; Itami, Atsushi; Okabe, Hiroshi; Hata, Hiroaki; Tanaka, Eiji; Yamashita, Yoshito; Kondo, Masato; Hosogi, Hisahiro; Hoshino, Nobuaki; Tanaka, Shiro; Sakai, Yoshiharu",Surgical endoscopy,142,16

They are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of the Coronaviridae family. Proteases of SARS-CoV-2 are necessary for viral replication, structural assembly, and pathogenicity. The approximately 33.8 kDa M pro protease of SARS-CoV-2 is a non-human homologue and is highly conserved among several coronaviruses, indicating that M pro could be a potential drug target for Coronaviruses. Methods: Herein, we performed computational ligand screening of four pharmacophores (OEW, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and N3) that are presumed to have positive effects against SARS-CoV-2 M pro protease (6LU7), and also screened 50,000 natural compounds from the ZINC Database dataset against this protease target. Results: We found 40 pharmacophore-like structures of natural compounds from diverse chemical classes that exhibited better affinity of docking as compared to the known ligands. The 11 best selected ligands, namely ZINC1845382, ZINC1875405, ZINC2092396, ZINC2104424, ZINC44018332, ZINC2101723, ZINC2094526, ZINC2094304, ZINC2104482, ZINC3984030, and ZINC1531664, are mainly classified as beta-carboline, alkaloids, and polyflavonoids, and all displayed interactions with dyad CYS145 and HIS41 from the protease pocket in a similar way as other known ligands. Conclusions: Our results suggest that these 11 molecules could be effective against SARS-CoV-2 protease and may be subsequently tested in vitro and in vivo to develop novel drugs against this virus.","Silva Andrade, Bruno; Ghosh, Preetam; Barh, Debmalya; Tiwari, Sandeep; José Santana Silva, Raner; Rodrigues de Assis Soares, Wagner; Silva Melo, Tarcisio; Santos Freitas, Andria; González-Grande, Patrícia; Sousa Palmeira, Lucas; Carlos Junior Alcantara, Luiz; Giovanetti, Marta; Góes-Neto, Aristóteles; Ariston de Carvalho Azevedo, Vasco",F1000Research,142,1

To support the pathologists, a new technical professional role, the pathologists' assistant (PA), has been introduced. METHODS We decided to carry out a retrospective analysis on PAs' performance. This was compared with that of junior/senior pathologists in the amount and type of surgical specimens examined, the number of lymph node retrieved in colorectal resections, the number of cases needing a second grossing procedure and the average time spent in grossing. As the COVID-19 pandemic period in fact resulted in a dramatic reduction of histological cases in our department, we divided PA activities into two periods, according to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS 'Simple' specimens made up the majority (92%) of the specimens examined by PAs in pre-COVID-19 period while 'complex' specimens, often neoplastic, represented the minor part (7%). However, 'simple' specimens dropped to 81% and 'complex' specimens rose to 18% in the COVID-19 period, when PAs had the chance to test themselves with more complicated surgical samples, under the supervision of a pathologist. Lymph node retrieval rate and average time spent in grossing are in line with literature data and confirm that PAs performance is comparable with pathologists' one, in selected settings. CONCLUSION In our experience, PA has represented a fundamental time-saving resource for the pathologists, who can devote time almost exclusively to diagnostic reporting.","Bortesi, Mara; Marchetti, Marialisa; Arpaia, Ilaria; Marchi, Letizia; Ganassi, Marilena; Zanetti, Eleonora; Fontanesi, Cristina; Costantini, Massimo; Piana, Simonetta",Journal of clinical pathology,142,1

The mucosa and the content of the small intestine from newborn pre-weaned piglets with diarrhea were tested for the presence of PEDV by molecular and morphologic methods, and found to be positive. Negative-staining electron microscopy (EM) revealed the presence of coronavirus- like particles in the samples. The result of molecular detection by nested RT-PCR based on the amplification of the M gene was positive. Using a novel alternative method we successfully propagated the PEDV strain (CH/QX-2) in Vero cells, confirmed by ultrathin sections of the cells and Immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Phylogenetic analysis based on the partial S gene showed that the CH/QX-2 isolate was genetically closer to strains more commonly found in China, but differed genetically from two domestic strains (CH/S, 1986 and LZC, 2007), Korean strains (DR13, 2007), and the vaccine strain (CV777 vs) currently being used in China. CH/QX-2 formed a unique clade in the derived phylogenetic tree indicating that the CH/QX-2 strain currently circulating in central China is a new variant of PEDV. This study extends current knowledge on the diversity and epidemiology of PEDV.","Li, Ren-feng; Tian, Xiang-qin; Liu, Yong; Xu, Jing; Liu, Dong-yang",Polish journal of veterinary sciences,142,33

METHODS Two-hundred community participants completed the four subtests of the CBB on an iPad platform, during a free adult health check on two islands in the region, between October and December 2016. Acceptability was defined as completing the learning trial of a task and usability as continuing a task through to completion, determined by examiner acumen and internal Cogstate completion and integrity criteria. These were combined into a single dichotomous completion measure for logistic regression analyses. Performance-measured as reaction times and accuracy of responses-was analyzed using linear regression analyses. RESULTS CBB completion ranged from 82.0% to 91.5% across the four tasks and the odds of completing decreased with age. After adjusting for age, iPad/tablet familiarity increased the odds of completion for all tasks while level of education and employment increased the odds for some tasks only. These variables accounted for 18.0%-23.8% of the variance in reaction times on speeded tasks. Age and education had the most effect, although semipartial correlations were modest. CONCLUSIONS When administered in a health-screening context, the acceptability and usability of the CBB were greatest in young- to middle-aged participants with some education and iPad/tablet experience. Older and more vulnerable participants may have benefited from additional time and practice on the CBB prior to administration.","Thompson, Fintan; Cysique, Lucette A; Harriss, Linton R; Taylor, Sean; Savage, Greg; Maruff, Paul; Mcdermott, Robyn",Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists,142,16

At year-end 2019, an estimated 1.2 million persons in the United States were living with HIV infection (2). Using data reported to the National HIV Surveillance System, CDC estimated the annual number of new HIV infections (incidence) among persons aged ≥13 years in the United States during 1981-2019. Estimated annual HIV incidence increased from 20,000 infections in 1981 to a peak of 130,400 infections in 1984 and 1985. Incidence was relatively stable during 1991-2007, with approximately 50,000-58,000 infections annually, and then decreased in recent years to 34,800 infections in 2019.

Combating antimicrobial resistant microbes (AMR) requires coordinated international efforts that incorporate new conventional antibiotic development as well as development of alternative drugs with antimicrobial activity, management of existing antimicrobials, and rapid detection of AMR pathogens. Areas covered: This manuscript discusses some conventional strategies to control microbial resistance. The main purpose of the manuscript is to present information on specific herbal medicines that may serve as good treatment alternatives to conventional antimicrobials for infections sensitive to conventional as well as resistant strains of microorganisms. Expert commentary: Identification of potential new antimicrobials is challenging; however, one source for potential structurally diverse and complex antimicrobials are natural products. Natural products may have advantages over other post-germ theory antimicrobials. Many antimicrobial herbal medicines possess simultaneous antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal and/or antiviral properties. Herbal products have the potential to boost host resistance to infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Antimicrobial broad-spectrum activity in conjunction with immunostimulatory properties may help to prevent microbial resistance to herbal medicine. As part of the efforts to broaden use of herbal medicines to treat microbial infections, pre-clinical and clinical testing guidelines of these compounds as a whole should be implemented to ensure consistency in formulation, efficacy and safety.","Enioutina, Elena Yu; Teng, Lida; Fateeva, Tatyana V; Brown, Jessica C S; Job, Kathleen M; Bortnikova, Valentina V; Krepkova, Lubov V; Gubarev, Michael I; Sherwin, Catherine M T",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,142,1

Particularly, recent evidences suggested that men may be considered as at higher risk of poor prognosis or death once the infection occurred and concerns surfaced in regard of the risk of a possible testicular injury due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS Several data support the existence of a bivalent role of testosterone (T) in driving poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. On one hand, this is attributable to the fact that T may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells by means of an enhanced expression of transmembrane serine-protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). At the same time, younger man with normal testicular function compared to women of similar age are prone to develop a blunted immune response against SARS-CoV-2, being exposed to less viral clearance and more viral shedding and systemic spread of the disease. Conversely, low levels of serum T observed in hypogonadal men predispose them to a greater background systemic inflammation, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and immune system dysfunction, hence driving harmful consequences once SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred. Finally, SARS-CoV-2, as a systemic disease, may also affect testicles with possible concerns for current and future testicular efficiency. Preliminary data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 genome is not normally found in gonads and gametes, therefore sex transmission could be excluded as a possible way to spread the COVID-19. CONCLUSION Most data support a role of T as a bivalent risk factor for poor prognosis (high/normal in younger; lower in elderly) in COVID-19. However, the impact of medical treatment aimed to modify T homeostasis for improving the prognosis of affected patients is unknown in this clinical setting. In addition, testicular damage may be a harmful consequence of the infection even in case it occurred asymptomatically but no long-term evidences are currently available to confirm and quantify this phenomenon. Different authors excluded the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in sperm and oocytes, thus limiting worries about both a potential sexual and gamete-to-embryos transmission of COVID-19. Despite these evidence, long-term and well-designed studies are needed to clarify these issues.","Lisco, Giuseppe; Giagulli, Vito A; De Pergola, Giovanni; De Tullio, Anna; Guastamacchia, Edoardo; Triggiani, Vincenzo","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",142,14

The association between AGA and cerebellar ataxias has been inconsistently reported. METHODS We performed a systematic literature search and a meta-analysis to study the weighted pooled OR of idiopathic cerebellar ataxia (IDCA) cases to controls or to hereditary ataxia (HA) for AGA seropositivity using fixed effect model. RESULTS Eleven studies were included, with a total of 847 IDCA cases, 1654 controls and 445 HA cases. IDCA cases had fourfold higher odds than controls (OR 4.28, 95% CI 3.10 to 5.90) and twofold higher odds than HA cases (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.45 to 3.44) of having AGA seropositivity. Sensitivity analysis excluding the most weighted study, which accounted for 69% of the total weight, still showed similar associations (IDCA vs controls, OR 3.18, 95% CI 1.79 to 5.67 and IDCA vs HA, OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.86, respectively). The subgroup analysis showed that, when compared with controls, IDCA cases of both East Asian and Western countries had approximately threefold to fourfold higher odds to have AGA seropositivity (OR 3.41, 95% CI 1.67 to 6.97 and OR 4.53, 95% CI 3.16 to 6.49, respectively), suggesting the lack of ethnic heterogeneity. The odds of AGA seropositivity for HA cases was not significantly higher than controls (OR 1.41, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.44).

Many of these patients have pre-existing conditions that make them more prone to COVID-19 symptoms, and this susceptibility potentially increases after BoNT-A injections. METHODS A retrospective chart review of 500 patients identified 256 pediatric patients with cerebral palsy who received an intramuscular BoNT-A injection to determine relative doses used for each Gross Motor Functional Classification Score (GMFCS). Data regarding age, weight, GMFCS, BoNT-A total body dosage, and inpatient hospitalizations for 6 months post-injection were collected. Differences between GMFCS levels were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance testing. Inpatient hospitalizations were recorded and assessed using relative risk to determine the population risk of hospitalization in the setting of initiating injections during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Based on GMFCS level, patients who were GMFCS I or II received fewer units of BoNT-A medication per kilogram of body weight compared to GMFCS III-V (p< 0.0005, F= 25.38). There was no statistically significant difference in frequency or time to hospitalization when comparing patients receiving BoNT-A compared to a control group. CONCLUSIONS Resumption of BoNT-A injections during the time of COVID-19 requires a systematic approach based on risks and potential benefits. Data from this analysis does not show increased risk for patients who received injections historically; however, recommendations for resumption of injections has not previously been proposed in the setting of a pandemic. In this manuscript, a tiered approach to considerations for injections was proposed. Botulinum toxin type A injections have a history of improving spasticity in the pediatric patient with cerebral palsy. Ensuring appropriate selection of patients for injection with BoNT-A during this pandemic is increasingly important.","McLaughlin, Matthew J; Fisher, Mark T; Vadivelu, Sathya; Ramsey, Justin; Ratnasingam, Denesh; McGhee, Emily; Hartman, Kim",Journal of pediatric rehabilitation medicine,142,1

Prior to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, NYC H+H served over one million patients, including the most vulnerable New Yorkers, and billed fewer than 500 telehealth visits monthly. Once the pandemic struck, we established a strategy to allow us to continue to serve existing patients and treat the surge of new patients. Starting in March 2020 we were able to transform the system using virtual care platforms through which we conducted almost 83,000 billable televisits in one month and more than 30,000 behavioral health encounters via telephone and video. Telehealth also enabled us to support patient-family communication, post-discharge follow-up, and palliative care for COVID-19 patients. Expanded Medicaid coverage and insurance reimbursement for telehealth played a pivotal role in this transformation. As we move to a new blend of virtual and in-person care, it is vital that the major regulatory and insurance changes undergirding our COVID-19 telehealth response be sustained to protect access for our most vulnerable patients.

The elderly and persons with chronic diseases are especially vulnerable to health problems due to heat. This article is devoted to the question of the extent to which the effects of heat waves in Germany are changing over time, and whether preventive health measures are working. METHODS We use a statistical model to quantify the effect of high mean temperatures on mortality. Within this model, different exposure-response curves for the three temporal intervals 1992-2000, 2001-2010, and 2011-2017 are estimated. Attention is also paid to the delayed effect on mortality of high mean temperatures in the preceding week. RESULTS Our analysis reveals a clear, systematic association of the mean temperature in the current week, as well as the mean temperature in the preceding week, with weekly mortality. This association is more pronounced for higher age groups and decreases over the years under analysis, with the exception of a relatively weak effect of heat in southern Germany in 1992-2000. The strongest effects were related to the heat waves in 1994 and 2003, with approximately 10 200 and 9600 fatalities, respectively. Approximately 7800 fatalities were estimated for the summer of 2006, and 4700 and 5200 for 2010 and 2015, respectively. CONCLUSION In Germany, as elsewhere, climate change has been causing more frequent, more intense, and longer periods of heat in the summer. The harmful effect of heat on health is reduced by adaptive processes, presumably including successful preventive measures. Such measures should be extended in the future, and perhaps complemented by other measures in order to further diminish the effect of heat on mortality .","An der Heiden, Matthias; Muthers, Stefan; Niemann, Hildegard; Buchholz, Udo; Grabenhenrich, Linus; Matzarakis, Andreas",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,142,25

Despite the paucity of high-quality scientific studies assessing its effectiveness, this procedure is being used increasingly. This review aims to describe commonly used techniques for SPILS appendicectomies (SPILA), to summarise complication rates in the literature and to provide discussion on indications and implementation. METHODS All available databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE(®) and Embase™ were searched in February 2011 and cross-referenced for available English literature describing SPILA in patients of any age. RESULTS Three broad technical approaches are described: procedures using laparoscopic instruments through a single skin incision in the abdominal wall, regardless of the number of fascial incisions, with or without the additional use of percutaneous sutures or wires to 'assist' the operation, and hybrid procedures, in which the appendix is exteriorised using a single incision laparoscopically assisted operation but subsequently divided using a conventional 'open' appendicectomy technique. Complication rates seem to be highest in SPILA procedures unassisted by sutures or wires.

STUDY DESIGN The clinical data of 2,056 patients (2,473 hernias) who underwent laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair at Shanghai Minimally Invasive Surgery Center between January 2001 and December 2011 were analyzed retrospectively. The operation priority was used to divide the patients into 7 groups for analysis of the learning curve. RESULTS There were 1,005 transabdominal preperitoneal patch plastic repairs (TAPP), 1,458 total extraperitoneal repairs (TEP), and 10 intraperitoneal onlay mesh repairs performed on 874, 1,175, and 7 patients, respectively. Median follow-up period was 60 months. The operation time and postoperative hospital stay for TEP were considerably shorter than those for TAPP. The complication rate for TEP, especially seroma, was considerably lower. Transabdominal preperitoneal patch plastic repair was performed in 81.4% of the recurrent inguinal hernias. Seven patients underwent unilateral intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair and 3 others underwent unilateral intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair and TAPP on the opposite. Most of patients with grade I and II hernias underwent TEP. The learning curve has demonstrated that more obstacles occurred in the earlier phase of the laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair training, supported by findings such as fewer cases performed annually, longer operation time, and higher incidence of complications and recurrence. These findings have improved as experience is accumulated through more operations. In addition, the ratios of TEP to TAPP and mesh nonfixation to fixation also evolved throughout the course of the study. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is a feasible technique that can be popularized in China.","Feng, Bo; He, Zi-Rui; Li, Jian-Wen; Ling, Tian-Long; Zhang, Yun; Chen, Xin; Lu, Ai-Guo; Wang, Ming-Liang; Zheng, Min-Hua",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,142,10

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Orthodontic Clinic at School of Dentistry of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo. PARTICIPANTS A total of 108 orthodontic patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Pre-treatment orthodontic records were evaluated. Dental casts were used to determine the maximum crown measurements of fully erupted permanent teeth in the mesiodistal dimensions. Second and third molars were not included in the analysis. Genomic DNA samples were used for the genotyping of four genetic polymorphisms: ESR1 (rs9340799 and rs2234693) and ESR2 (rs1256049 and rs4986938). The associations between tooth size and sex were evaluated using t test. The associations between tooth size and genotype were analysed with linear regression and adjusted by sex at an alpha of P⩽0.05. RESULTS Female patients presented smaller tooth size than male patients. A statistically significant difference was observed in almost all teeth (P<0.05). The genetic polymorphisms in rs9340799, rs2234693, rs1256049 and rs4986938 were associated with some tooth sizes in both the maxilla and mandible (P<0.05). CONCLUSION This study provides evidence that genetic polymorphisms in ESR1 and ESR2 could be associated with tooth size in permanent teeth.","Cunha, Arthur S; Vertuan Dos Santos, Luiza; Schaffer Pugsley Baratto, Samantha; Abbasoglu, Zerrin; Gerber, Jennifer Tsi; Paza, Aleysson; Matsumoto, Mírian Aiko Nakane; Scariot, Rafaela; Stuani, Maria Bernadete; Küchler, Erika Calvano",Journal of orthodontics,142,20

This study was undertaken to establish the degree of familial clustering of groin hernias on a nationwide scale. Methods A register-based cohort was created consisting of all children in Denmark whose parents were born in 1970 or later by the use of the Danish Civil Registration System. Within this cohort, all groin hernia operations were identified. To establish the risk estimates associated with a positive family history of groin hernia operation, information on groin hernia operations in fathers, mothers and siblings was also assessed. Results In the cohort of 408 381 persons, a total of 4966 were operated on for groin hernia (incidence rate 2·12 per 1000 person-years at risk). A person with a mother who had undergone surgery for a groin hernia had an increased risk of 2·89 (95 per cent c.i. 2·48 to 3·34) of having a groin hernia operation; a person with a father operated on for a groin hernia had an increased risk of 1·75 (1·58 to 1·94); and a person with a sibling operated on for a groin hernia had an increased risk of 2·54 (2·17 to 2·96). The strongest association was seen between mothers who had been operated on for groin hernia and their daughters (increased risk 6·01, 95 per cent c.i. 4·53 to 7·80), compared with the risk in girls who did not have a mother who had undergone surgery for groin hernia. Conclusion Groin hernias are clustered in families, with the strongest relationship seen between mothers and their daughters.","Burcharth, J; Pedersen, M; Bisgaard, T; Pedersen, C B; Rosenberg, J",BJS open,142,31

The objectives of this study were to (1) describe acute care general surgery procedures performed at the largest referral hospital in Rwanda and (2) understand the geographic distribution of disease presentations and referral patterns. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected acute care surgery cases performed at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali (CHUK) in Rwanda between June 1 and December 1, 2011. Using Pearson's χ(2) test and the Fisher exact test, we compared cases originating from within Kigali and transfers from other provinces. Geospatial analyses also were used to further describe transfer patterns. RESULTS During the study period, 2,758 surgical interventions were performed, of which 25.6% (707/2,758) were general surgery operations. Of these, 45.4% (321/707) met the definition of acute care surgery. Only about one-third-32.3% (92/285)-of patients resided within Kigali, whereas about two-thirds-67.7% (193/285)-were transferred from other provinces. Most patients transferred from other provinces were younger than 18 years of age (40.4%; 78/193), and 83.0% (39/47) of patients older than 50 years of age originated from outside of Kigali. Specific operative indications and surgical procedures varied substantially between patients from Kigali and patients transferred from other provinces. CONCLUSION Emergency surgical conditions remain important contributors to the global burden of disease, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Geographic variations exist in terms of operative diagnoses and procedures, which implies a need for improved access to surgical care at the district level with defined transfer mechanisms to greater-level care facilities when needed.","Wong, Evan G; Ntakiyiruta, Georges; Rousseau, Mathieu C; Ruhungande, Landouald; Kushner, Adam L; Liberman, Alexander S; Khwaja, Kosar; Dakermandji, Marc; Wilson, Marnie; Razek, Tarek; Kyamanywa, Patrick; Deckelbaum, Dan L",Surgery,142,17

Studies evaluating palliative care in ILD are rapidly expanding. Uniform outcome measures are crucial to assessing the impact of palliative care in ILD. This scoping review evaluates existing outcome measures in general health-related quality of life (HRQoL), physical health, mental health, social health and advance care planning (ACP) domains in patients with ILD. Articles in English with quantitative assessment of at least one measure of general HRQoL, physical health, mental health, social health or ACP in patients with ILD were included. Searches across three databases yielded 3488 non-duplicate articles. 23 met eligibility criteria and included three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or secondary analysis of an RCT (13%), three cross-sectional studies or secondary analysis of cross-sectional study (13%), one prospective study (4%) and 16 retrospective studies (70%). Among eligible articles, 25 distinct instruments were identified. Six studies assessed general HRQoL (26%), 16 assessed physical health (70%), 11 assessed mental health (48%), six assessed social health (26%) and 16 assessed ACP (70%). The ability to compare results across studies remains challenging given the heterogeneity in outcome measures.

She asks, particularly, how psychological therapies are positioned during such a crisis, and whether the pressures of triage and emergency can leave time and space for sustained emotional and psychological care. She wonders how psychoanalytic time with its containing rhythm can be held onto in the face of the need for triage on the one hand and the flight to online and telephone delivery on the other.

As hospital length of stay decreases, the timely diagnosis of leak becomes more important. We evaluated CT esophagram, white blood count (WBC), and drain amylase levels in the early detection of anastomotic leak. METHODS The diagnostic performance of CT esophagram, drain amylase >800 IU/L, and WBC >12,000/µL within the first 10 days after surgery in predicting leak at any time after esophagectomy was calculated. RESULTS Anastomotic leak occurred in 13 patients (13%). CT esophagram performed within 10 days of surgery diagnosed six of these leaks with a sensitivity of 0.54. Elevation in drain amylase level within 10 days of surgery diagnosed anastomotic leak with a sensitivity of 0.38. When the CT esophagram and drain amylase were combined, the sensitivity rose to 0.69 with a specificity of 0.98. WBC elevation had a sensitivity of 0.92, with a specificity of 0.34. Among 30 patients with normal drain amylase and a normal WBC, one developed an anastomotic leak. CONCLUSIONS Drain amylase adds to the sensitivity of CT esophagram in the early detection of anastomotic leak. Selected patients with normal drain amylase levels and normal WBC may be able to safely forgo CT esophagram.","Baker, Erin H; Hill, Joshua S; Reames, Mark K; Symanowski, James; Hurley, Susie C; Salo, Jonathan C",Journal of gastrointestinal oncology,142,1

Understanding what influences decision-making in HIV-positive people in Africa may help researchers and policy makers in the development of broader, more effective interventions and policies. METHODS We used thematic synthesis and a grounded theory approach to generate a detailed narrative and theoretical model reflecting life with HIV in Africa, and how this influences ART adherence and engagement decisions. We included qualitative primary studies that explored perspectives, perceptions and experiences of HIV-positive people, caregivers and healthcare service providers. We searched databases from 1 January 2013 to 9 December 2016, screened all studies, and selected those for inclusion using purposeful sampling methods. Included studies were coded with Atlas.ti, and we assessed methodological quality across five domains. RESULTS We included 59 studies from Africa in the synthesis. Nine themes emerged which we grouped under three main headings. First, people who are HIV-positive live in a complicated world where they must navigate the challenges presented by poverty, competing priorities, unpredictable life events, social identity, gender norms, stigma, and medical pluralism-these influences can make initiating and maintaining ART difficult. Second, the health system is generally seen as punishing and uninviting and this can drive HIV-positive people out of care. Third, long-term engagement and adherence requires adaptation and incorporation of ART into daily life, a process which is facilitated by: inherent self-efficacy, social responsibilities, previous HIV-related illnesses and emotional, practical or financial support. These factors together can lead to a ""tipping point"", a point in time when patients choose to either engage or disengage from care. HIV-positive people may cycle in and out of these care states in response to fluctuations in influences over time. CONCLUSION This analysis provides a practical theory, arising from thematic synthesis of research, to help understand the dynamics of adherence to ART and engagement in HIV care. This can contribute to the design of service delivery approaches, and informed thinking and action on the part of policy makers, providers, and society: to understand what it is to be HIV-positive in Africa and how attitudes and the health service need to shift to help those with HIV lead 'normal' lives.","Eshun-Wilson, Ingrid; Rohwer, Anke; Hendricks, Lynn; Oliver, Sandy; Garner, Paul",PloS one,142,1

METHODOLOGY This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (β = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72. CONCLUSIONS Public health interventions were likely effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. There is a need to further improve the testing capacity. The high-risk category of individuals being prioritized for hospital admission should be redefined to include individuals older than 50 years.","Gupta, Manoj Kumar; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Goel, Akhil Dhanesh; Saurabh, Suman; Misra, Sanjeev",Journal of infection in developing countries,142,20

Thus, it is important to identify risk factors to reduce the mortality rate. This study aimed to assess the factors associated with hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients, and develop a prediction score based on these findings. Methods: We analyzed 111 patients, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The following patient characteristics were obtained from records: age, gender, type of symptoms, onset of symptoms, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), absolute lymphocyte count, chest x-ray abnormalities, lung involvement, type of lesion, radiographic assessment of the quantity of lung edema (RALE) score, and mortality. Data were analyzed using SPSS 25.0. Results Multivariate analysis showed that age >50 years ( p=0.043), NLR score >5.8 ( p=0.016) and RALE score >2 ( p=0.002) can predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients in the hospital. ROC curve analysis of the score ability to predict mortality showed an area under the curve of 0.794. The cut-off point is 4.5, with a sensitivity of 96.7% and specificity of 49.4% to predict the mortality of COVID-19 patient in the hospital. Conclusions Age, NLR score and RALE score were associated with mortality of COVID-19 patients in the hospital and could be used as a predictor for discharge probability of COVID-19 patients in low health care resource setting. The prediction score may be useful for frontline physicians to effectively manage patients with a higher score to prevent mortality.","Sensusiati, Anggraini Dwi; Amin, Muhammad; Nasronudin, Nasronudin; Rosyid, Alfian Nur; Ramadhan, Nanda Aulya; Lathifah, Rofida; Puspitasari, Eva; Wahyuningtyas, Ria Indah; Soebakti, Erika",F1000Research,142,19

These guidelines include recommendations for clinicians, researchers, policy- and decision-makers, funders, publishers, public health experts, disaster preparedness and response experts, infrastructure providers from the perspective of different domains (Clinical Medicine, Omics, Epidemiology, Social Sciences, Community Participation, Indigenous Peoples, Research Software, Legal and Ethical Considerations), and other potential users. These guidelines include recommendations for researchers, policymakers, funders, publishers and infrastructure providers from the perspective of different domains (Clinical Medicine, Omics, Epidemiology, Social Sciences, Community Participation, Indigenous Peoples, Research Software, Legal and Ethical Considerations). Several overarching themes have emerged from this document such as the need to balance the creation of data adherent to FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable), with the need for quick data release; the use of trustworthy research data repositories; the use of well-annotated data with meaningful metadata; and practices of documenting methods and software.

The purpose of this scoping review was to explore the impact of natural and man-made disasters on contraception in OECD member countries. METHODS Manual searches and systematic searches in six electronic databases were conducted with no language restrictions. All articles were screened by at least two researchers. The data were analysed thematically. RESULTS 108 articles were included. Most focussed on the Zika virus outbreak (n = 50) and the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 28). Four key themes were identified: importance of contraception during disasters, impact of disasters on contraceptive behaviour, barriers to contraception during disasters and ways of improving use of contraception during disasters. Despite efforts to increase access to contraception including by transforming ways of delivery, barriers to use meant that unmet need persisted. CONCLUSIONS To prevent adverse health outcomes and reduce health costs as a result of failure to have access to contraception during disasters, there is a need to intensify efforts to remove barriers to use. This should include increasing access and information on methods of contraception and their side effects (e.g., menstrual suppression) and making contraception freely available.","Freed, Benjamin; Hillman, Sarah; Shantikumar, Saran; Bick, Debra; Dale, Jeremy; Gauly, Julia",The European journal of contraception & reproductive health care : the official journal of the European Society of Contraception,142,1

In this investigation, we sought to find evidence of RSV seroconversion in cord blood and explore its clinical implications for the newborn. METHODS Offspring from 22 pregnant women with a history of viral respiratory infection during the third trimester of pregnancy (RVI group) and 40 controls were enrolled in this study between September 1, 2016 and March 31, 2019. Cord blood sera were tested for anti-RSV antibodies by indirect fluorescent antibody assay. RSV seropositivity was defined as the presence of anti-RSV IgM or IgA, in addition to IgG in cord blood serum at ≥1:20 dilution. RESULTS Anti-RSV IgG was present in all cord blood serum samples from infants born to RVI mothers (95% CI=82-100%), with 16 samples also having elevated titers for either anti-RSV IgA or IgM (73%; 95% CI=52-87%). No controls had evidence of anti-RSV antibodies. Eight (50%) seropositive newborns developed at least one respiratory tract finding, including RDS (N=8), respiratory failure (N=3), and pneumonia (N=1). RSV seropositive newborns also required more days on oxygen, had leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein (p=0.025, p=0.047 and p<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS This study provides evidence of acute seropositivity against RSV in cord blood of newborns delivered from mothers with a history of upper respiratory tract illness in the third trimester. Cord blood seropositivity for anti-RSV IgA or IgM was associated with adverse clinical and laboratory outcomes in newborns. This article is protected by copyright.

The measures implemented had to do mostly with scientific preparation and team reorganization; management of personal protective equipment; redesigning the department's clinical common areas, separation of patient circuits with creation of a designated COVID Operating Room, Post-Anesthetic Care Unit; rescheduling of elective surgery and testing all patients before anesthesia procedures and consulting other hospital departments. The reported data covers the period between the 2nd March and the 30th April of 2020. In this period, 64 cases with COVID-19 or with high clinical suspicion were approached. To date, there have been no cases of in-hospital spread to other patients or to professionals in this department. With this paper we intend to start a reflection that will end up with the optimization of strategies that allows health systems to deal better with COVID-19, keeping patients and health providers safe.","Fernandes, Sofia; Petiz, Catarina; Abecasis, Manuel; Duarte, Luís; Da Costa, Filipe Marques; Paulino, Ana; Ormonde, Lucindo",Acta medica portuguesa,142,13

Key ion channels (mainly the funny channel, HCN4) and Ca2+-handling proteins in the SN are responsible for its function. Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression through inhibition or activation and microRNAs (miRs) do this through inhibition. There is high expression of macrophages and mast cells within the SN connective tissue. 'Novel'/unexplored TFs and miRs in the regulation of ion channels and immune cells in the SN are not well understood. Using RNAseq and bioinformatics, the expression profile and predicted interaction of key TFs and cell markers with key miRs in the adult human SN vs. right atrial tissue (RA) were determined. PRINCIPAL RESULTS 68 and 60 TFs significantly more or less expressed in the SN vs. RA respectively. Among those more expressed were ISL1 and TBX3 (involved in embryonic development of the SN) and 'novel' RUNX1-2, CEBPA, GLI1-2 and SOX2. These TFs were predicted to regulate HCN4 expression in the SN. Markers for different cells: fibroblasts (COL1A1), fat (FABP4), macrophages (CSF1R and CD209), natural killer (GZMA) and mast (TPSAB1) were significantly more expressed in the SN vs. RA. Interestingly, RUNX1-3, CEBPA and GLI1 also regulate expression of these cells. MiR-486-3p inhibits HCN4 and markers involved in immune response. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, RUNX1-2, CSF1R, TPSAB1, COL1A1 and HCN4 are highly expressed in the SN but not miR-486-3p. Their complex interactions can be used to treat SN dysfunction such as bradycardia. Interestingly, another research group recently reported miR-486-3p is upregulated in blood samples from severe COVID-19 patients who suffer from bradycardia.","Aminu, Abimbola J; Petkova, Maria; Atkinson, Andrew J; Yanni, Joseph; Morris, Alex D; Simms, Robert T; Chen, Weixuan; Yin, Zeyuan; Kuniewicz, Marcin; Holda, Mateusz K; Kuzmin, Vladislav S; Perde, Filip; Molenaar, Peter; Dobrzynski, Halina",Progress in biophysics and molecular biology,142,1

Proteins packaged during virus assembly may subsequently form the first line of attack and host manipulation upon infection. A complete characterization of virion components is therefore important to understanding the dynamics of early stages of infection. Mass spectrometry and kinase profiling techniques identified nearly 200 incorporated host and viral proteins. We used published interaction data to identify hubs of connectivity with potential significance for virion formation. Surprisingly, the hub with the most potential connections was not the viral M protein but the nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), which is one of the novel virion components identified by mass spectrometry. Based on new experimental data and a bioinformatics analysis across the Coronaviridae, we propose a higher-resolution functional domain architecture for nsp3 that determines the interaction capacity of this protein. Using recombinant protein domains expressed in Escherichia coli, we identified two additional RNA-binding domains of nsp3. One of these domains is located within the previously described SARS-unique domain, and there is a nucleic acid chaperone-like domain located immediately downstream of the papain-like proteinase domain. We also identified a novel cysteine-coordinated metal ion-binding domain. Analyses of interdomain interactions and provisional functional annotation of the remaining, so-far-uncharacterized domains are presented. Overall, the ensemble of data surveyed here paint a more complete picture of nsp3 as a conserved component of the viral protein processing machinery, which is intimately associated with viral RNA in its role as a virion component.","Neuman, Benjamin W; Joseph, Jeremiah S; Saikatendu, Kumar S; Serrano, Pedro; Chatterjee, Amarnath; Johnson, Margaret A; Liao, Lujian; Klaus, Joseph P; Yates, John R; Wüthrich, Kurt; Stevens, Raymond C; Buchmeier, Michael J; Kuhn, Peter",Journal of virology,142,17

While there is widespread agreement over how wasteful medical care spending is defined, there is no consensus on its magnitude or categories. A shared understanding of the magnitude and components of the issue may aid in systematically reducing wasteful spending and creating opportunities for these funds to improve public health.To this end, we performed a review and crosswalk analysis of the literature to retrieve comprehensive estimates of wasteful medical care spending. We abstracted each source's definitions, categories of waste, and associated dollar amounts. We synthesized and reclassified waste into 6 categories: clinical inefficiencies, missed prevention opportunities, overuse, administrative waste, excessive prices, and fraud and abuse.Aggregate estimates of waste varied from $600 billion to more than $1.9 trillion per year, or roughly $1800 to $5700 per person per year.

Ginsenosides extracted from ginseng have been reported against obesity and the associated metabolic disorders. As a subtype of ginsenoside, ginsenoside Ro is a critical constituent of ginseng. However, its specific effects on obesity remains unknown. G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 5 (TGR5, also known as GPBAR1) is a bile acid membrane receptor, widely expressed in human tissues contributing to various metabolic processes to confer the regulations of glucose and lipid homeostasis.TGR5 has displayed potentials as a therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Here, we explore the anti-obesity effect of ginsenoside Ro with TGR5 activation screened by a library of natural products. Our results showed that the ginsenoside Ro (90mg/kg) treatment ameliorated body weight and lipid accumulation in multiple metabolic organs of high fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice without affecting food intake, and improved oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests (IPITT), and fasting serum glucose. We also found that triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) in serum and liver were significantly decreased after ginsenoside Ro treatment. Then we used Tgr5 knockout mice to explore the role of Tgr5 in the anti-obesity effect of ginsenoside Ro.Our results further demonstrated that ginsenoside Ro promoted glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion and energy expenditure in wild type DIO mice. However, the stimulation of ginsenoside Ro on GLP-1 secretion and energy expenditure were restrained in the Tgr5 knockout mice.In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that ginsenoside Ro ameliorates obesity and insulin resistance in DIO mice via activating TGR5. Significance Statement Obesityis dramatically increasing worldwide and it contributes to multiple metabolic diseases. TGR5 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Ginsenoside Ro, as aoleanane-type ginsenoside, ameliorates obesity and insulin resistance, promotes GLP-1 secretion, increases energy expenditure via activating TGR5. Ginsenoside Ro could be a potential leading compound for treating obesity and its associated metabolic diseases.","Jiang, Lin-Shan; Li, Wei; Zhuang, Tong-Xi; Yu, Jie-Jing; Sun, Shuai; Ju, Zheng-Cai; Wang, Zheng-Tao; Ding, Li-Li; Yang, Li",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,142,1

METHODS One hundred patients, 38% men, with a median age of 61 years and median body mass index of 26 kg/m(2) , underwent LESS fundoplications. The operative times, placement of additional trocars, conversions to ""open"" operations, and complications were compared among patient quartiles to establish a learning curve. Median data are reported. RESULTS The median operative times and complications did not differ among 25-patient cohorts. Additional trocars were placed in 27% of patients, 67% of whom were in the first 25-patient cohort. Patients undergoing LESS fundoplication had a dramatic relief in the frequency and severity of all symptoms of reflux across all cohorts equally (P < .05), particularly for heartburn and regurgitation, without causing dysphagia. CONCLUSION LESS fundoplication ameliorates symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease without apparent scarring. Notably, few operations required additional trocars after the first 25-patient cohort. Patient selection became more inclusive (eg, more ""redo"" fundoplications) with increasing experience, whereas operative times and complications remained relatively unchanged. The learning curve of LESS fundoplication is definable, short, and safe. We believe that patients will seek LESS fundoplication because of the efficacy and superior cosmetic outcomes; surgeons will need to meet this demand.","Ross, Sharona B; Choung, Edward; Teta, Anthony F; Colibao, Lotiffa; Luberice, Kenneth; Paul, Harold; Rosemurgy, Alexander S",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,142,1

QTc prolongation is a worrisome adverse effect, scarcely studied in pediatrics. PATIENTS AND METHODS Pediatric patients affected from COVID-19 who received antivirals were matched (1:2) with controls not infected nor exposed. Electrocardiograms were prospectively analyzed at baseline, during the first 72 h in treatment and after 72 h. RESULTS Eleven (22.9%) out of 48 patients admitted due to COVID-19 (March-July 2020) received antiviral therapy. All had underlying diseases: congenital heart disease (4/11; 36.4%) and immunosuppression (3/11; 27.3%) stand out. 5/11 (45.5%) received treatment at baseline with a potential effect on QTc. There where no differences observed in the baseline QTc between cases and controls: 414.8 ms (49.2) vs. 416.5 ms (29.4) (p = 0.716). Baseline long QT was observed in 2/11 cases and 2/22. Among cases, 10/11 (90.9%) received hydroxychloroquine, mainly associated with azithromycin (8/11; 72.7%), 3 received lopinavir/ritonavir and one remdesivir. The median increase in QTc after 72 h under treatment was 28.9 ms (IQR 48.7) (p = 0.062). 4/11 (36.4%) patients had a long QTc at 72 h, resulting in 3 patients ≥500 ms; treatment was stopped in one (QTc 510 ms) but ventricular arrhythmias were not documented. CONCLUSIONS The use of antivirals caused an increase on the QTc interval after 72 h of treatment, being the QTc long in 36.3% of the patients, although no arrhythmic events were observed. The use of hydroxychloroquine and antivirals requires active QTc monitoring and it is recommended to discontinue treatment if QTc >500 ms.","Esmel-Vilomara, Roger; Dolader, Paola; Sabaté-Rotes, Anna; Soriano-Arandes, Antoni; Gran, Ferran; Rosés-Noguer, Ferran",Anales de pediatria,142,1

However, it is not known how factors effecting symmetry discrimination in static patterns might affect temporal integration in dynamic patterns. One such feature is luminance polarity. Using dynamic stimuli with increasing temporal delay (SOA) between the onset of the first and second element in a symmetric pair, we investigated how four different luminance-polarity conditions affected the temporal integration of symmetric patterns. All four luminance polarity conditions showed similar upper temporal limits of approximately 60 ms. However psychophysical performance over all delay durations showed significantly higher symmetry thresholds for unmatched-polarity patterns at short delays, but also significantly less sensitivity to increasing temporal delay relative to matched-polarity patterns. These varying temporal windows are consistent with the involvement of a fast, sensitive first-order mechanism for matched-polarity patterns, and a slower, more robust second-order mechanism for unmatched-polarity patterns. Temporal integration windows for unmatched-polarity patterns were not consistent with performance expected from attentional mechanisms alone, and instead supports the involvement of second-order mechanisms that combines information from ON and OFF channels.","Bellagarda, Cayla A; Dickinson, J Edwin; Bell, Jason; Badcock, David R",Vision research,142,16

However, conventional contact tracing is resource intensive and is unable to trace all the cases due to recall bias and anonymity of a number of close contacts. So far, few studies have reported the epidemiological features of cases not identified from contact tracing (""unlinked cases"") or described their potential roles in seeding community outbreaks. OBJECTIVE Here we characterized the role of unlinked cases in the epidemic by comparing their epidemiological profile with the linked cases and estimated their transmission potential across different settings. METHODS We obtained the government rapid surveillance data containing the line-listing of COVID-19 confirmed cases accounting for the first three waves in Hong Kong. We compared the demographics, history of chronic illnesses, epidemiological characteristics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes between linked and unlinked cases. Transmission potentials at different settings were assessed by fitting a negative binomial distribution to the observed offspring distribution. RESULTS Time interval from illness onset to hospital admission was longer among unlinked cases than the linked (median: 5.00 vs 3.78 days; P<.001), with a higher proportion experiencing critical or serious conditions (13.0% vs 8.2%; P<.001). The proportion of unlinked cases was associated with the increase of the weekly number of local cases (P=.049). Cluster transmissions from the unlinked cases were most frequently identified in household settings, followed by eateries and workplaces, with the estimated probability of cluster transmissions being around 0.4 for households and 0.1-0.3 for the latter two settings. CONCLUSIONS The unlinked cases were positively associated with the time to hospital admission, severity of infection, and epidemic size - implying a need to design and implement digital tracing methods to complement current conventional testing and tracing. To minimize the risk of cluster transmissions from unlinked cases, digital tracing approaches should be effectively applied in high-risk socio-economic settings, and risk assessment conducted to review and adjust the policies.","Chong, Ka Chun; Jia, Katherine; Lee, Shui Shan; Hung, Chi Tim; Wong, Ngai Sze; Lai, Tsz Tsun; Chau, Nancy; Yam, Carrie; Chow, Tsz Yu; Wei, Yuchen; Guo, Zihao; Yeoh, Eng Kiong",JMIR public health and surveillance,142,24

We have previously shown that gene therapy delivery of human NT3 into affected forelimb muscles improves sensorimotor recovery after stroke in adult and elderly rats. Here, to move toward the clinic, we tested the hypothesis that intramuscular infusion of NT3 protein could improve sensorimotor recovery after stroke. METHODS Rats received unilateral ischemic stroke in sensorimotor cortex. To simulate a clinically feasible time to treatment, 24 hours later rats were randomized to receive NT3 or vehicle by infusion into affected triceps brachii for 4 weeks using implanted catheters and minipumps. RESULTS Radiolabeled NT3 crossed from the bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord in rodents with or without strokes. NT3 increased the accuracy of forelimb placement during walking on a horizontal ladder and increased use of the affected arm for lateral support during rearing. NT3 also reversed sensory impairment of the affected wrist. Functional magnetic resonance imaging during stimulation of the affected wrist showed spontaneous recovery of peri-infarct blood oxygenation level-dependent signal that NT3 did not further enhance. Rather, NT3 induced neuroplasticity of the spared corticospinal and serotonergic pathways. INTERPRETATION Our results show that delayed, peripheral infusion of NT3 can improve sensorimotor function after ischemic stroke. Phase I and II clinical trials of NT3 (for constipation and neuropathy) have shown that peripheral high doses are safe and well tolerated, which paves the way for NT3 as a therapy for stroke.

Our aims were to assess the feasibility and acceptability of performing acupuncture for the treatment of chronic pain in adults with SCD. METHODS This was a single-arm, prospective pilot study of six adults with SCD. Participants reported ⩾ 3 months of chronic pain and were > 18 years of age. Per protocol, acupuncture was to be administered twice per week for 5 weeks, for 30 min per session. All treatments were performed in the acupuncture treatment laboratory at the University of Illinois Chicago College of Nursing. Pain intensity, pain interference, and other symptoms were measured at baseline and after the intervention. Participants completed a semi-structured interview and a protocol acceptability questionnaire after the acupuncture intervention. RESULTS Six participants (mean age 52.5 years, six Black) were enrolled. Although the study was suspended due to COVID-19 and not all participants completed the 10-session protocol, completion rates were high with no missed appointments. One participant did not complete the study due to hospitalization unrelated to acupuncture. No adverse events were reported. At completion of the intervention at 4-5 weeks post-baseline, all participants had reduced pain intensity and pain interference. The mean acceptability score on the protocol acceptability questionnaire was 82%. CONCLUSION It was feasible and acceptable to implement acupuncture in adults with SCD.

Higher values on the GAD-7 anxiety scale were associated with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Odds Ratio=0.78 for each+1 point in GAD-7; 95% confidence interval 0.65-0.95). Within this rather anxious group of subjects, however, the rate of cancellation of medical appointments was also increased (Odds Ratio=1.13 for each+1 point in GAD-7; 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.16). An acute infection was detected in six of a total of 2,451 participants in the point prevalence assessment (0.24%; 95% confidence interval 0.09-0.53%). CONCLUSION Between the first and second COVID-19 waves in Germany, we found a low level of SARS-CoV-2 contamination in the city of Würzburg. A more anxious personality was associated with a lower seroprevalence. Conducting the study was largely facilitated by the existing cohort study.","Eichner, Felizitas A; Gelbrich, Götz; Weißbrich, Benedikt; Dölken, Lars; Kurzai, Oliver; Deckert, Jürgen; Ertl, Georg; Barth, Maria; Hein, Grit; Neuhauser, Hannelore; Morbach, Caroline; Störk, Stefan; Heuschmann, Peter",Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)),142,31

Botulinum toxin-A (Botox-A) is used as pharmacologic agent not only for aesthetic purposes, but also for its vasomotor actions. This study was conducted to establish whether local application of Botox-A increased survival of random pattern skin flaps in rats by changing the expression of neurotransmitters. Forty adult Sprague-Dawley rats with a caudally-based random pattern skin flap were divided into two groups: Botox-A group and saline group. Surviving flap area and cutaneous blood flow in the flap were evaluated on postoperative days 3 and 7. After injection of Botox-A, changes in vessels were analyzed using immunohistochemical staining. Levels of norepinephrine, neuropeptide-Y, nitric oxide, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase were analyzed quantitatively by high performance liquid chromatography, Western blot, and colorimetric assay. The survived area in the Botox-A group was significantly higher than that in the control group on postoperative days 3 and 7. Blood flow in the Botox-A group was significantly high in the proximal and middle areas immediately after the operation. The number of CD31-positive vessels in the Botox-A group was significant greater than that in the control group. Norepinephrine level in the Botox-A group decreased significantly immediately after flap elevation and at postoperative day 3. There were no significant differences in neuropeptide-Y level between the two groups. Nitric oxide level did not change significantly in either group despite the increase in endothelial nitric oxide synthase immediately after flap elevation and at 3 days postoperatively. In conclusion, Botox-A increased vascular blood flow and viable flap area in rats by reducing norepinephrine level. In contrast, neuropeptide-Y, another vasoconstrictor, was not affected by Botox-A. Nitric oxide, a vasodilator, was also not affected by Botox-A, despite the significant increase in endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression in the flaps.","Roh, Tai Suk; Jung, Bok Ki; Yun, Insik; Lew, Dae Hyun; Kim, Young Seok",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,142,1

Various approaches have been utilized to determine the concentration of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-neutralizing antibodies in plasma products. The Canadian Blood Services used Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test 50 (PRNT50) -generated values to qualify convalescent plasma donations supporting clinical trials in Canada. This manuscript describes changes in PRNT50 titers of repeat male plasma donations collected approximately 1-4 months after onset of COVID-19 signs and symptoms in donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Men were eligible to donate if they: met standard criteria, were < 67 years of age, reported a previous SARS-CoV-2-positive nucleic acid test, and recovered and were symptom free for at least 28 days prior to donation. Repeat donation analysis required at least one original and one repeat donation where a PRNT50 was performed. RESULTS From April 29, 2020 to July 25, 2020, 156 donors donated once, with 78 (50%) of the donated plasma having PRNT50 titers of ≥1:160. Thirty-seven (23.7%) of the donated plasma had a titer of 1:40 or 1:80 (individuals donating this plasma were asked to donate a second time only). A total of 30 donors (19.2%) had repeat donations. Of the repeat donors, 15 (50%) had at least an eightfold change from peak to trough PRNT50 titers within greater than 90 days after onset of COVID-19 symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Blood operators cannot infer that SARS-CoV-2 PRNT50 will remain high in repeat plasma donors 3-4 months after onset of COVID-19 symptoms.","Drews, Steven J; Devine, Dana V; McManus, Janet; Mendoza, Emelissa; Manguiat, Kathy; Wood, Heidi; Girardin, Roxie; Dupuis, Alan; McDonough, Kathleen; Drebot, Michael",Transfusion,142,1

Since an endoscopy unit and its staff are at potentially high risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we conducted a survey for the management of the gastrointestinal endoscopic practice, personal protective equipment (PPE), and risk assessment for COVID-19 during the pandemic at multiple facilities.Methods: The 11-item survey questionnaire was sent to representative respondent of Department of Gastroenterology, Osaka City University Hospital, and its 19 related facilities.Results: A total of 18 facilities submitted valid responses and a total of 373 Health care professionals (HCPs) participated. All facilities (18/18: 100%) were screening patients at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection before endoscopy. During the pandemic, we found that the total volume of endoscopic procedures decreased by 44%. Eleven facilities (11/18: 61%) followed recommendations of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society (JGES); consequently, about 35%-50% of esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were canceled. Mask (surgical mask or N95 mask), face shield/goggle, gloves (one or two sets), and gown (with long or short sleeves) were being used by endoscopists, nurses, endoscopy technicians, and endoscope cleaning staff in all the facilities (18/18: 100%). SARS-CoV-2 infection risk assessment of HCPs was conducted daily in all the facilities (18/18: 100%), resulting in no subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCPs.Conclusion: COVID-19 has had a dramatic impact on the gastrointestinal endoscopic practice. The recommendations of the JGES were appropriate as preventive measures for the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the endoscopy unit and its staff.","Maruyama, Hirotsugu; Hosomi, Shuhei; Nebiki, Hiroko; Fukuda, Takashi; Nakagawa, Koichiro; Okazaki, Hirotoshi; Yamagami, Hirokazu; Hara, Junichi; Tanigawa, Tetsuya; Machida, Hirohisa; Aomatsu, Kazuki; Watanabe, Yoshihisa; Sato, Hiroshi; Uno, Hironori; Takaishi, Osamu; Nomura, Tsutomu; Ochi, Masahiro; Oshitani, Nobuhide; Adachi, Kenji; Higashimori, Akira; Ominami, Masaki; Nadatani, Yuji; Fukunaga, Shusei; Otani, Koji; Tanaka, Fumio; Kamata, Noriko; Nagami, Yasuaki; Taira, Koichi; Watanabe, Toshio; Fujiwara, Yasuhiro",Romanian journal of internal medicine = Revue roumaine de medecine interne,142,31

This study aimed to clinically and histomorphometric compare commercially-available sandblasted (RBM) implants, treated with hydrothermal anodization and placed into an animal maxillary sinus model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty 3.75 mm × 8.5 mm threaded titanium implants were placed into the maxillary sinuses of 10 sheep via an external approach, with three test groups and 10 implants per group: right side, Control = CP-titanium with RBM surface, Test group 1 = CP-titanium with RBM + anodized surface; left side, Test group 2 = Ti-6Al-7Nb with RBM + anodized surface. Schneiderian membranes were elevated but not bone grafted. Resonant frequency analysis (RFA) was measured at surgery. Animals were sacrificed after 1 month unloaded healing. Resin-embedded undemineralized ground-sections were digitised, and mean bone-implant contact (% BIC) was measured bilaterally for the best-three consecutive threads. RESULTS Seven of 30 implants showed signs of failure. RFA was low at placement but did not differ between the groups (group mean ISQ values ranged from 23 to 35; χ(2) = 0.37). RFA was not repeated at sacrifice due to implant instability. Histomorphometric analysis showed % BIC was highest for control (34.8 ± 15.7), followed by Test 1 (29.6 ± 18.1) and Test 2 implants (23.3 ± 22.7), but this difference was not statistically significant (χ(2) = 0.3). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Early integration of RBM implants placed into thin maxillary sinus walls was not enhanced by hydrothermal anodization of implant surfaces. This may be related to the initial low stability of the implants and the relatively short healing period. However, non-anodized RBM surfaces showed promising results, with % BIC values comparable to the best estimates of other studies using sinus grafting. Whether the modification of the implant surfaces through anodization with simultaneous sinus grafting would promote enhanced early osseointegration, is a subject of future research.","Duncan, Warwick J; Gay, Jennifer H A; Lee, Min-Ho; Bae, Tae-Sung; Lee, Sook-Jeong; Loch, Carolina",Clinical oral implants research,142,1

Although many instruments facilitating OLV are available, the choice is limited in pediatric patients. PATIENT CONCERNS A 4-year-old female (weight: 18.6 kg, height: 100 cm) was admitted via our pediatric outpatient clinic because of recurrent hemoptysis, 2 weeks in duration. She had no medical or surgical history. DIAGNOSIS Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a 4.5-cm-diameter mass in the left, lower lung lobe. She was diagnosed with a congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM). INTERVENTIONS She was scheduled for emergency lobectomy via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). To ensure successful VATS, OLV was essential. As our hospital lacked a small-diameter fiberoptic bronchoscope and a proper bronchial blocker, we decided to use single-lumen tube (SLT) with adult fiberoptic bronchoscope. OUTCOMES We performed successful bronchoscopic-guided OLV using a SLT. We aligned the tube to the right upper lobar bronchus and Murphy eye to prevent obstruction of the right upper lobe bronchus. At the end of surgery, the endotracheal tube lumen had been narrowed by blood clots, we decided to exchange the tracheal tube. The tube was immediately exchanged. After re-intubation, the pulse oximetry (SpO2) then gradually increased.

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes in patients with umbilical hernias complicated by liver cirrhosis. METHODS Between 2001 and 2010, 44 patients were enrolled in this study. The comparison between non-operative and operative group was performed. Patients who underwent emergency versus elective surgery were also compared. RESULTS Of the 44 patients, there were 33 men and 11 women. Thirty-one patients (70.5%) underwent surgery and 13 patients (29.5%) were treated conservatively. Overall morbidity and mortality rates following herniorrhaphy were 42% and 6.5%. The mean albumin level was significantly lower and total bilirubin, creatinine and mean model of end-stage liver disease score were significantly higher in non-operative group than in operative group. Combined resection was performed more frequently in the emergency group than in elective group. A significantly higher proportion of patients in emergency operation group had postoperative complications (P=0.01), especially ascites (P=0.02). The operative time and postoperative hospital stay were significantly shorter in the elective operation group than in emergency operation group. CONCLUSIONS Early, elective repair of umbilical hernias in cirrhotic patients should be advocated considering the hepatic reserve and patient's condition.

We describe how stroke presents as a clinical syndrome and how imaging as the most important biomarker will help differentiate between stroke subtypes and treatment eligibility. The evolution of hyperacute treatment has led to the current standard of care: intravenous thrombolysis with tissue-type plasminogen activator and endovascular treatment for proximal vessel occlusion in the anterior cerebral circulation. All patients with acute ischemic stroke are in need of hyperacute secondary prevention because the risk of recurrence is highest closest to the index event. The dominant themes of modern stroke care are the use of neurovascular imaging and speed of diagnosis and treatment.","Zerna, Charlotte; Hegedus, Janka; Hill, Michael D",Circulation research,142,1

METHOD Using organizational responses from the 2014 and 2016 waves of the National Mental Health Service survey, this study conducted multivariate logistic analyses to assess whether the ACA policies related to integrated care increased the provision of integrated addictions treatment and primary care at mental health Hispanic-Serving Organizations, relative to Mainstream Organizations. RESULTS Findings showed that Hispanic-Serving Organizations (54.4%) were less likely to provide integrated health services than Mainstream Organizations (59.1%) after the ACA. However, federal funding to help organizations transition into integrated care services (AOR = 1.74, p = 0.01) and accepting Medicaid payments (AOR = 1.59, p = 0.01) increased the provision of integrated care services at Hispanic-Serving Organizations over time.

Common themes of factors contributing to social isolation in each of the health care delivery settings are described, and opportunities for creative interventions by health care providers are identified. As the pandemic continues to unfold and evolve, providers should aim to regularly assess patient risk of isolation and be proactive in preventing negative effects. Additionally, what is learned from health care providers' experiences delivering palliative care during a pandemic can be incorporated into daily practice as social isolation and loneliness are long-standing challenges for the elderly population.","Harden, Karen; Price, Deborah M; Mason, Heidi; Bigelow, April",Journal of hospice and palliative nursing : JHPN : the official journal of the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association,142,16

We performed a propensity score-matched analysis to compare safety and efficacy between the FD and stent-assisted coiling. METHODS A database review was conducted to identify patients with large and giant unruptured aneurysms (aneurysms located in the ACA, MCA, or PCA were excluded) treated with the FD or stent-assisted coiling. A propensity score, representing the probability of using the FD, was generated for each aneurysm using the relevant patient and aneurysmal variables. Angiographic results, complications, and clinical outcomes were compared. RESULTS Forty-five aneurysms treated with the FD (FD alone: 32; FD+Coils: 13) and 45 treated with stent-assisted coiling were matched. The rate of complete occlusion was significantly (P = 0.0002) higher in the FD cohort than the conventional stent cohort at the 6-month follow-up. The FD cohort achieved greater improvement (P < 0.0001) and a lower rate of recurrence (P = 0.0001). The rate of periprocedural complications was similar, as was the proportion of patients who attained mRS ≤ 2 at discharge and at the 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide reliable evidence demonstrating that the FD may be a preferred treatment option for large and giant unruptured aneurysms. KEY POINTS • Flow Diverter provided a higher complete occlusion rate at 6-month follow-up. • Flow Diverter achieved more progress occlusion and less recurrence. • Compared with the conventional stents, procedure-related morbidity of Flow Diverter was similar. • Flow Diverter is a preferred treatment for large and giant unruptured aneurysms.","Zhang, Yongxin; Zhou, Yu; Yang, Pengfei; Liu, Jianmin; Xu, Yi; Hong, Bo; Zhao, Wenyuan; Chen, Qi; Huang, Qing-Hai",European radiology,142,2

In light of growing scientific interest in the treatment of this group, a multistakeholder think tank was convened to discuss the current state of knowledge, improve the care of these patients, and identify appropriate study populations for future observational and randomized trials in the field. Although recent epidemiologic studies in selected populations estimate that the prevalence of aTRH is 10% to 15% of hypertensive patients, further large-scale observational studies will be needed to better elucidate risk factors. To spur the development of therapies for aTRH, the development of an ""aTRH"" label for pharmacologic and device therapies with a developmental pathway including treatment added to the use of existing therapies is favored. Although demonstration of adequate BP lowering should be sufficient to gain Food and Drug Administration approval for therapies targeting aTRH, assessment of improvement in quality of life and cardiovascular outcomes is also desirable and considered in Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services coverage decisions. Device trials under the aTRH label will need uniform and consistent processes for defining appropriate patient populations as well as postapproval registries assessing both long-term safety and duration of responses. Finally, patients with aTRH are likely to benefit from evaluation by a hypertension team to assure proper patient identification, diagnostic work-up, and therapeutic management before consideration of advanced or novel therapies to lower BP.","Vemulapalli, Sreekanth; Ard, Jamy; Bakris, George L; Bhatt, Deepak L; Brown, Alan S; Cushman, William C; Ferdinand, Keith C; Flack, John M; Fleg, Jerome L; Katzen, Barry T; Kostis, John B; Oparil, Suzanne; Patel, Chet B; Pepine, Carl J; Piña, Ileana L; Rocha-Singh, Krishna J; Townsend, Raymond R; Peterson, Eric D; Califf, Robert M; Patel, Manesh R",American heart journal,142,11

Correct thoracic placement during the resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) may be important for achieving effective CPR. HYPOTHESIS The positioning of the REBOA in the thoracic aorta during CPR will affect systemic arterial pressures. METHODS Cardiac arrest was induced in 27 anesthetized pigs. After 7 min of CPR with a mechanical compression device, REBOA in the thoracic descending aorta at heart level (zone Ib, REBOA-Ib, n = 9), at diaphragmatic level (zone Ic, REBOA-Ic, n = 9) or no occlusion (control, n = 9) was initiated. The primary outcome was systemic arterial pressures during CPR. RESULTS During CPR, REBOA-Ic increased systolic blood pressure from 86 mmHg (confidence interval [CI] 71-101) to 128 mmHg (CI 107-150, P < 0.001). Simultaneously, mean and diastolic blood pressures increased significantly in REBOA-Ic (P < 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively), and were higher than in REBOA-Ib (P = 0.04 and P = 0.02, respectively) and control (P = 0.005 and P = 0.003, respectively). REBOA-Ib did not significantly affect systemic blood pressures. Arterial pH decreased more in control than in REBOA-Ib and REBOA-Ic after occlusion (P = 0.004 and P = 0.005, respectively). Arterial lactate concentrations were lower in REBOA-Ic compared with control and REBOA-Ib (P = 0.04 and P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Thoracic aortic occlusion in zone Ic during CPR may be more effective in increasing systemic arterial pressures than occlusion in zone Ib. REBOA during CPR was found to be associated with a more favorable acid-base status of circulating blood. If REBOA is used as an adjunct in CPR, it may be of importance to carefully determine the aortic occlusion level.The study was performed following approval of the Regional Animal Ethics Committee in Linköping, Sweden (application ID 418).","Dogan, Emanuel M; Beskow, Linus; Calais, Fredrik; Hörer, Tal M; Axelsson, Birger; Nilsson, Kristofer F",Shock,142,20

Radical excision of these retroperitoneal liposarcomas is often challenging due to their large size and proximity to visceral organs and major vessels. Here we present the 30-year experience of our multidisciplinary sarcoma team in the treatment of these tumors and analysis of factors influencing survival. METHODS Patients with retroperitoneal liposarcomas treated in Helsinki University Hospital from 1987 to 2017 were reviewed. Local recurrence-free survival, metastases-free survival, and disease-specific survival were assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis, and factors influencing survival were evaluated with Cox regression. RESULTS A total of 107 patients were identified. The median follow-up time was 5.4 years (interquartile range: 2.2-8.8 years). Local recurrence developed in 72% and metastases in 15% during follow-up. The 5-year disease-free survival was 31% and disease-specific survival was 66%. The multifactorial analysis revealed histological type and grade as predictors of disease-specific survival (P < .01) while multifocality carried a poor prognosis for local recurrence (P = .02) and higher histological grade for metastases (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS Retroperitoneal liposarcomas rarely metastasize but tend to recur locally. For tumors that have been resected with macroscopically clear margins, histological, type, and grade are significant predictors of survival.","Homsy, Pauliina; Heiskanen, Ilkka; Sampo, Mika; Rönty, Mikko; Tukiainen, Erkki; Blomqvist, Carl",Journal of surgical oncology,142,17

However, questions remain about the patterns of ocular inflammation and the distribution of viral antigen in the eyes of cats with FIP. This study characterized the ocular lesions of FIP including the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and proliferating cell nuclear antigen by Müller cells in the retina in cases of FIP and to what extent macrophages are involved in ocular inflammation in FIP. Immunohistochemistry for FCoV, CD3, CD79a, glial fibrillary acidic protein, calprotectin, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen was performed on paraffin sections from 15 naturally occurring cases of FIP and from controls. Glial fibrillary acidic protein expression was increased in the retina in cases of FIP. Müller cell proliferation was present within lesions of retinal detachment. Macrophages were present in FIP-associated ocular lesions, but they were the most numerous inflammatory cells only within granulomas (2/15 cats, 13%). In cases of severe inflammation of the ciliary body with damage to blood vessel walls and ciliary epithelium (3/15, 20%), some macrophages expressed FCoV antigens, and immunolabeling for calprotectin on consecutive sections suggested that these FCoV-positive macrophages were likely to be recently derived from blood. In cases of severe and massive inflammation of most ocular structures (4/15, 26%), B cells and plasma cells predominated over T cells and macrophages. These results indicate that gliosis can be present in FIP-affected retinas and suggest that breakdown of the blood-ocular barrier can allow FCoV-bearing macrophages to access the eye.","Ziółkowska, Natalia; Paździor-Czapula, Katarzyna; Lewczuk, Bogdan; Mikulska-Skupień, Elżbieta; Przybylska-Gornowicz, Barbara; Kwiecińska, Kamila; Ziółkowski, Hubert",Veterinary pathology,142,17

Furthermore, the ERP characteristics, their field distribution and the area of their maximum field intensity were extracted and compared between young and elderly, as well as between females and males. A two tone oddball experiment was conducted, involving 27 young adults and 18 elderly, healthy and right handed, and HD-EEG data were acquired. These data were then subjected to auditory ERPs extraction and thorough statistical analysis. The derived experimental results revealed significant age-related differences to both the latencies and the amplitudes of the MMN and the P300 and the topographic distribution of the HD-EEG amplitudes. Additionally, a shift in the maximum intensities from frontal to temporal lobe with aging appeared in the case of the P300, whereas no effect was observed for the MMN component. No statistical significant differences (p>0.05) due to age was found in N400 characteristics. Finally, gender-related differences were significant in the response time of the subjects, finding males response faster. The level and the location of the maximum intensity of sources also differed between genders, especially in young subjects. These findings justify the enhanced potential of HD-EEG data to accurately reflect the age and gender dependencies at the three components of simple auditory ERPs and pave the way for the investigation of neurodegenerative pathologies, such as the Alzheimer's disease.","Tsolaki, Anthoula; Kosmidou, Vasiliki; Hadjileontiadis, Leontios; Kompatsiaris, Ioannis Yiannis; Tsolaki, Magda",Brain research,142,7

There is still insufficient understanding of how it occurs and whether it is due to the sphincter length, relaxation, or pressure differences. Aim This study evaluates the effect on the lower esophageal sphincter of the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) technique applied in surgery in cases of morbid obesity using ambulatory 24-h pH monitoring (APM) and esophageal manometry (EM). Material and methods A retrospective examination was carried out on the APM and EM tests performed preoperatively and postoperatively in cases of LSG. The parameters examined were the body mass index (BMI), amplitude pressure of the esophagus (AP), total length of the lower esophageal segment (LESL), resting pressure of the LES (LESP), residual pressure of the LES (LESR), relaxation time of the LES, intragastric pressure, and the DeMeester score. Results A total of 62 cases with available data were evaluated. A statistically significant difference was determined between the preoperative values and the 3-month postoperative values of BMI, LESP, and relaxation time of the LES. A statistically significant increase was determined in the DeMeester score, and the increase in the total number of reflux episodes longer than 5 min was found to be the most responsible for this increase. No significant difference was determined in the other parameters. Conclusions The LSG was found to cause a reduction in LESP, and an increase in acid reflux causing an extended relaxation time of the LES. This was confirmed by the increase seen in the DeMeester score.","Gemici, Eyup; Kones, Osman; Seyit, Hakan; Surek, Ahmet; Cikot, Murat; Bozkurt, Mehmet Abdussamet; Alis, Halil",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,142,26

Traffic flow prediction (TFP) is one of the key macroscopic parameters of traffic that supports traffic management in ITS. Growth of the real-time data in transportation from various modern equipments, technology, and other resources has led to generate big data, posing a huge concern to deal with. Recently, deep learning (DL) techniques have demonstrated the capability to extract comprehensive features efficiently, using multiple hidden layers, from such huge raw, unstructured, and nonlinear data. Nonlinearity in traffic data is the major cause of inaccuracy in TFP. In this article, we propose a flow strength indicator-based Chronological Dolphin Echolocation-Fuzzy, a bioinspired optimization method with fuzzy logic for incremental learning of deep belief network. Technical indicators provide flow strength features as an input to the model. Hidden layers of DL architecture consequently learn more features and propagate it as an input to next layer for supervised learning. The degree of membership to the features is identified by the membership functions, followed by weight optimization using Dolphin Echolocation algorithm to fit the model for the nonlinear data. Experiments performed on two different data sets, namely Traffic-major roads and performance measurement system-San Francisco (PEMS-SF), show good results for the proposed deep architecture. The analysis of the proposed method using log mean square error and log root mean square deviation acquires a minimum value of 2.4141 and 0.61 for the Traffic-major roads database taken for the time step duration of 1 year and a minimum value of 1.6691 and 0.5208 for PEMS-SF data set for the time step interval of 5 minutes, respectively. These positive results demonstrate key importance of our traffic flow model for the transportation system.","George, Shiju; Santra, Ajit Kumar",Big data,142,1

We hypothesized good outcome and low mortality after LVRS for selected patients with severe hyperinflation and nonhomogeneous morphology even when diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco) is less than 20%. METHODS The study included all patients scheduled for LVRS between March 2005 and May 2014 with a preoperative Dlco of less than 20%. Postoperative 90-day mortality was the primary end point. Secondary end points were postoperative lung function and surgical morbidity at 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS Included were 33 patients with a median forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 23% (interquartile range, 19% to 28%), a median diffusion capacity of 15% (interquartile range, 13% to 18%), and a median hyperinflation of 76% (residual volume-to-total lung capacity ratio of 70% to 76%). Mean follow-up was 44.8 months (range, 10 to 141 months). Heterogeneous emphysema was present in 26 patients, and 7 showed intermediately heterogeneous morphology. Sixteen procedures were bilateral, and 31 were performed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. The 90-day mortality was 0%. Median forced expiratory volume in 1 second percentage predicted at 3 months increased from 23% to 29% (p < 0.001). Median Dlco increased from 15% to 24% (p < 0.001), and median hyperinflation decreased from 76% to 63% (p < 0.001). A prolonged air leak exceeding 7 days occurred in 16 patients (48.5%), and 6 required reoperation for fistula closure. The 7 patients with intermediately heterogeneous emphysema showed a median increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 second from 20% preoperatively to 28% postoperatively (p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS Selected patients with severely impaired Dlco of less than 20% can cautiously be considered as potential candidates if hyperinflation is severe and the lungs show areas with advanced destruction as targets for resection.","Caviezel, Claudio; Schaffter, Nadja; Schneiter, Didier; Franzen, Daniel; Inci, Ilhan; Opitz, Isabelle; Weder, Walter",The Annals of thoracic surgery,142,16

Purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the TTNS procedure applied once a week and three times a week in women diagnosed with wet type refractory OAB. METHODS A total of 60 patients diagnosed with wet type OAB that was refractory to medical treatment were included in the study. Participants were equally and randomly divided into two groups: TTNS treatment was performed with a duration of 30 minutes for 12 weeks, once a week to Group-I and three times a week to Group-II. Pre and post-treatment OAB-V8/ICIQ-SF scores and voiding frequencies recorded in the bladder diary were compared between groups. RESULTS Four patients in Group-1 and eight in Group-2 left the study without completing the treatment. TTNS was performed in both groups for 12 weeks. There was a significant decrease in the voiding frequency, OAB-V8, ICIQ-SF scores in both group-1 and group-2 (p<0.001). A significant decrease in the OAB-V8 score was observed in the 5th week in Group-1, and in the 3rd week in Group-2. Complete response was observed in 6 patients (23.1%) in Group-1 after 12 weeks of TTNS procedure. In Group-2, 10 patients (45.5%) had a complete response. After the 12-week TTNS procedure, no significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of treatment response. CONCLUSION TTNS can be safely used before invasive treatments in resistant OAB. TTNS procedure three times a week seems more effective than performing it once a week.","Alkış, Okan; Sevim, Mehmet; Kartal, İbrahim Güven; Başer, Aykut; İvelik, Halil İbrahim; Aras, Bekir",International journal of clinical practice,142,30

End-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) has been shown to be a reliable parameter to reflect the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the chance of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). OBJECTIVES This study assessed the validity of early capnography as a predictive factor for ROSC and survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims with an underlying nonshockable rhythm. DESIGN Retrospective observational study. SETTING/PATIENTS During a 2-year observational period, data from 2223 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims within the city of Vienna were analysed. The focus was on the following patients: age more than 18 years, an underlying nonshockable rhythm, and advanced airway management within the first 15 min of advanced life support with subsequent capnography. INTERVENTION No specific intervention was set in this observational study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The first measured ETCO2, assessed immediately after placement of an advanced airway, was used for further analysis. The primary outcome was defined as sustained ROSC, and the secondary outcome was 30-day survival. RESULTS A total of 526 patients met the inclusion criteria. These were stratified into three groups according to initial ETCO2 values (<20, 20 to 45, >45 mmHg). Baseline data and resuscitation factors were similar among all groups. The odds of sustained ROSC and survival were significantly higher for patients presenting with higher values of initial ETCO2 (>45 mmHg): 3.59 [95% CI, 2.19 to 5.85] P = 0.001 and 5.02 [95% CI, 2.25 to 11.23] P = 0.001, respectively. On the contrary ETCO2 levels less than 20 mmHg were associated with significantly poorer outcomes. CONCLUSION Patients with a nonshockable out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who presented with higher values of initial ETCO2 had an increased chance of sustained ROSC and survival. This finding could help decision making as regards continuation of resuscitation efforts.","Poppe, Michael; Stratil, Peter; Clodi, Christian; Schriefl, Christoph; Nürnberger, Alexander; Magnet, Ingrid; Warenits, Alexandra-Maria; Hubner, Pia; Lobmeyr, Elisabeth; Schober, Andreas; Zajicek, Andreas; Testori, Christoph",European journal of anaesthesiology,142,1

We conducted a randomized phase III study investigating the efficacy of S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer by evaluating its noninferiority to tegafur-uracil plus leucovorin (UFT/LV). PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients aged 20-80 years with curatively resected stage III colon cancer were randomly assigned to receive S-1 (80-120 mg/day on days 1-28 every 42 days; four courses) or UFT/LV (UFT: 300-600 mg/day and LV: 75 mg/day on days 1-28 every 35 days; five courses). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 years. RESULTS A total of 1518 patients (758 and 760 in the S-1 and UFT/LV group, respectively) were included in the full analysis set. The 3-year DFS rate was 75.5% and 72.5% in the S-1 and UFT/LV group, respectively. The stratified hazard ratio for DFS in the S-1 group compared with the UFT/LV group was 0.85 (95% confidence interval: 0.70-1.03), demonstrating the noninferiority of S-1 (noninferiority stratified log-rank test, P < 0.001). In the subgroup analysis, no significant interactions were identified between the major baseline characteristics and the treatment groups. CONCLUSION Adjuvant chemotherapy using S-1 for stage III colon cancer was confirmed to be noninferior in DFS compared with UFT/LV.

Appropriate pelvic dissection can be measured by the adequacy of circumferential margin (CRM) and distal margin, both are risk factors of local recurrence. Among the various operative procedures for colorectal cancer, low anterior resection (LAR) for rectal cancer is one of the most demanding procedures because it requires resection of cancer with surrounding mesorectal tissue and reconstruction with anastomosis in the narrow pelvis while preserving the autonomic nerves of the urogenital organs particularly in the male pelvis. Low anterior resection is associated with a relatively high incidence of postoperative morbidities, including anastomotic leakage and other operative site infections, and asymptomatic patients infected with COVID-19 submitted to elective could be at higher risk which sometimes result in post operative mortality. Therefore, recognition of the incidence and risk factors of postoperative complications following low anterior resection is essential to prevent it. The importance of some risk factors such as age, nutrition status of the patient, experience of the surgeon and many other factors that influence outcome of colorectal surgery which could be modified pre operatively to prevent post operative complications. In the other hand long term post operative complications may promote tumor recurrence and decrease survival. The severity of these complications was evaluated by Clavien-Dindo classification (Table1) initiated in 1992 is based on the type of therapy needed to correct the complication. The principle of the classification is simple, reproducible, flexible, and applicable. The Clavien-Dindo Classification(1) appears reliable and may represent a compelling tool for quality assessment in surgery. Post-operative complications can also be classified according to time-line related to surgery as such, early postoperative complications can be defined where morbidity rates occurred within 30 days of the procedure (25%-32%)- (Table 2) or long-term as those that take place between the 30th post-operative day to 3 years following. The aims of this review are to provide an overview of the current literature on post operative complications of rectal surgery and to describe risk factors and strategies to prevent, treat or reduce complications.","Franchini Melani, Armando G; Capochin Romagnolo, Luis G",Minerva surgery,142,24

We conducted a survey in Lincang City to determine the measles vaccination status of children on the China-Myanmar border.Methods: We used multistage sampling among children aged 8-83 months. Information on measles vaccination status was obtained from the child's vaccination certificate, and serum samples were tested using commercially available ELISA kits.Results: A total of 938 children were surveyed. The vaccination coverage rate was 98.9% (95% CI: 98.2-99.6%) for measles-containing vaccine dose 1 (MCV1), and 95.8% (95% CI:94.9-96.7%) for measles-containing vaccine dose 2 (MCV2). The timely vaccination coverage rate was 52.0% (95% CI:48.8-55.2%) for MCV1, and 74.1% (95% CI: 82.9-89.0%) for MCV2. The timely-and-complete vaccination coverage rate was 41.0% (95% CI: 36.7-45.3%). The median delay period was 33 (95% CI: 27-39) days for MCV1, and 196 (95% CI: 146-246) days for MCV2. The seropositivity rate in children aged less than 7 years was 94.0% (95% CI: 92.5-95.5%) with a geometric mean titer of 1210.1 mIU/mL.Conclusions: The MCV coverage was high, but timely and timely-and-complete vaccination coverage were low and insufficient to prevent measles outbreaks. It is necessary to add the timely and timely-and-complete vaccination coverage as indicators of vaccination to provide a more complete picture of measles immunization status.","Yang, Xiaotong; Tang, Tingting; Yang, Zhikang; Liu, Lu; Yuan, Shuyi; Zhang, Tai",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,142,19

Although temperate phages constitute a significant fraction of the gut virome, the effects of lysogenic infection are underexplored. We report that the temperate phage, Bacteroides phage BV01, broadly alters its host's transcriptome, the prominent human gut symbiont Bacteroides vulgatus. This alteration occurs through phage-induced repression of a tryptophan-rich sensory protein (TspO) and represses bile acid deconjugation. Because microbially modified bile acids are important signals for the mammalian host, this is a mechanism by which a phage may influence mammalian phenotypes. Furthermore, BV01 and its relatives in the proposed phage family Salyersviridae are ubiquitous in human gut metagenomes, infecting a broad range of Bacteroides hosts. These results demonstrate the complexity of phage-bacteria-mammal relationships and emphasize a need to better understand the role of temperate phages in the gut microbiome.","Campbell, Danielle E; Ly, Lindsey K; Ridlon, Jason M; Hsiao, Ansel; Whitaker, Rachel J; Degnan, Patrick H",Cell reports,142,23

Drugs that raise serum/tissue ACE2 levels include ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) that are commonly used in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes. These comorbidities have adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients that might result from pharmacotherapy. Increasing ACE2 could potentially increase the risk of infection, severity or mortality in COVID-19 or it might be protective as it forms angiotensin-(1-7) which exhibits anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidative effects and prevents diabetes- and/or hypertension-induced end-organ damage. Thus, there existed clinical uncertainty. Here, we review studies implicating 15 classes of drugs in increasing ACE2 levels in vivo and the available literature on the clinical safety of these drugs in COVID-19 patients. Further, in a re-analysis of clinical data from a meta-analysis of 9 studies, we show that ACEIs/ARBs usage was not associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Literature suggests that ACEIs/ARBs usage generally appears to be clinically safe though their use in severe COVID-19 patients might increase the risk of acute renal injury. For definitive clarity, further clinical and mechanistic studies are needed in assessing the safety of all classes of ACE2 raising medications.","Akhtar, Saghir; Benter, Ibrahim F; Danjuma, Mohammed I; Doi, Suhail A R; Hasan, Syed S; Habib, Abdella M",Journal of drug targeting,142,1

Caregivers have barriers to accessing in-person treatment to manage stress. Technology allows for the dissemination of evidence-based interventions in a convenient way. This study examined usage rates of Pep-Pal (an evidence-based mobilized intervention to help caregivers of patients with advanced cancer manage distress) and estimates of efficacy on anxiety, depression, stress, and sexual dysfunction. METHODS Fifty-six primary caregivers of patients with advanced cancer were recruited through oncology clinics and randomized to either Pep-Pal (a mobilized psychoeducation and skills-based intervention for caregivers, n= 26) or treatment as usual (TAU, n= 30). All were screened for moderate anxiety on the HADS-A screening assessment (A ≥ 8) at baseline. RESULTS Participants randomized to Pep-Pal experienced greater reductions in perceived stress (PSS F = 3.91, p=.05), greater increases in ability to learn and use stress management skills (F = 6.16, p = 0.01), and greater increases in sexual function (women only; F = 5.07, p = 0.03) compared to participants in TAU. Of Pep-Pal participants, only 10 (38.5%) watched at least 7/9 full-length sessions. The a priori hypothesis and criterion that participants would watch at least 75% full-length sessions were not met. CONCLUSIONS A brief, easily disseminated mobile intervention showed poor adherence, but had limited estimates of efficacy for secondary outcomes; perceived stress, learning stress management skills, and sexual functioning (women only).

In this paper we examine his diaries at the time of the plague, as well as in the proceeding years and consider how the experiences of Pepys are similar to our own experiences of the 2020 Coronavirus Epidemic. METHOD We examined the entire diaries of Samuel Pepys from 1664 to 1670, as well as supplementary source material, looking for all references to The Great Plague.Results and Conclusion: Though written over 350 years ago the diaries paint a very co-orientated response of society to The Plague. Accurate official statistics were available weekly, isolation was imposed and the government made provision for 'pest houses' to be set up. Pepys is grateful to the doctors who remain in London but critical of the majority who flee the city.

The primary purpose of the study was to determine whether wearing Aqua Titan-treated stockings could improve balance and walking performance in an older population; secondary was to elucidate the mechanisms. In a randomized, double-blind crossover, 16 healthy older adults (age, 67.9 ± 4.2 years; BMI, 24.8 ± 3.1 kg/m²) performed two 4-day trials composed of baseline measures and fatiguing exercise on Day 1, with recovery measures at 14, 38 and 62 h post-exercise, wearing Aqua Titan and control stockings. Balance, walking performance, triceps surae stretch reflex, ankle range of motion and gastrocnemius muscle microvascular perfusion, blood flow and oxygen consumption were measured at baseline and during recovery. Aqua Titan had no effect on the microvascular parameters, but increased total ankle range of motion at 38 h (2.4°; 95% CI ± 1.8°) and 62 h (2.7°; ±1.7°), contributed to by increases in dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. There was decreasing persistence in the medial-lateral center of pressure movement at 38 h (q = 0, −0.0635 ± 0.0455), compared to control stockings. Aqua Titan garments hold potential for improving balance and mobility in older adults in the days following a bout of fatiguing exercise.

The impact of the pandemic on chronic urticaria (CU) and its management are largely unknown. AIM To understand how CU patients are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; how specialists alter CU patient management; and the course of CU in patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our cross-sectional, international, questionnaire-based, multicenter UCARE COVID-CU study assessed the impact of the pandemic on patient consultations, remote treatment, changes in medications, and clinical consequences. RESULTS The COVID-19 pandemic severely impairs CU patient care, with less than 50% of the weekly numbers of patients treated as compared to before the pandemic. Reduced patient referrals and clinic hours were the major reasons. Almost half of responding UCARE physicians were involved in COVID-19 patient care, which negatively impacted on the care of urticaria patients. The rate of face-to-face consultations decreased by 62%, from 90% to less than half, whereas the rate of remote consultations increased by more than 600%, from one in 10 to more than two thirds. Cyclosporine and systemic corticosteroids, but not antihistamines or omalizumab, are used less during the pandemic. CU does not affect the course of COVID-19, but COVID-19 results in CU exacerbation in one of three patients, with higher rates in patients with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic brings major changes and challenges for CU patients and their physicians. The long-term consequences of these changes, especially the increased use of remote consultations, require careful evaluation.","Kocatürk, Emek; Salman, Andaç; Cherrez-Ojeda, Ivan; Ricardo Criado, Paulo; Peter, Jonny; Comert-Ozer, Elif; Abuzakouk, Mohamed; Câmara Agondi, Rosana; Al-Ahmad, Mona; Altrichter, Sabine; Arnaout, Rand; Karla Arruda, Luisa; Asero, Riccardo; Bauer, Andrea; Ben-Shoshan, Moshe; Bernstein, Jonathan A; Bizjak, Mojca; Boccon-Gibod, Isabelle; Bonnekoh, Hanna; Bouillet, Laurence; Brzoza, Zenon; Busse, Paula; Campos, Regis A; Carne, Emily; Conlon, Niall; Criado, Roberta F; de Souza Lima, Eduardo M; Demir, Semra; Dissemond, Joachim; Doğan Günaydın, Sibel; Dorofeeva, Irina; Felipe Ensina, Luis; Ertaş, Ragıp; Mariel Ferrucci, Silvia; Figueras-Nart, Ignasi; Fomina, Daria; Franken, Sylvie M; Fukunaga, Atsushi; Giménez-Arnau, Ana M; Godse, Kiran; Gonçalo, Margarida; Gotua, Maia; Grattan, Clive; Guillet, Carole; Inomata, Naoko; Jakob, Thilo; Karakaya, Gul; Kasperska-Zając, Alicja; Katelaris, Constance H; Košnik, Mitja; Krasowska, Dorota; Kulthanan, Kanokvalai; Sendhil Kumaran, M; Lang, Claudia; Ignacio Larco-Sousa, José; Lazaridou, Elisavet; Anika Leslie, Tabi; Lippert, Undine; Calderón Llosa, Oscar; Makris, Michael; Marsland, Alexander; Medina, Iris V; Meshkova, Raisa; Bastos Palitot, Esther; Parisi, Claudio A S; Pickert, Julia; Ramon, German D; Rodríguez-Gonzalez, Mónica; Rosario, Nelson; Rudenko, Michael; Rutkowski, Krzysztof; Sánchez, Jorge; Schliemann, Sibylle; Enis Sekerel, Bulent; Serpa, Faradiba S; Serra-Baldrich, Esther; Song, Zhiqiang; Soria, Angèle; Staevska, Maria; Staubach, Petra; Tagka, Anna; Takahagi, Shunsuke; Francis Thomsen, Simon; Treudler, Regina; Vadasz, Zahava; Oliveira Rodrigues Valle, Solange; Van Doorn, Martijn B A; Vestergaard, Christian; Wagner, Nicola; Wang, Dahu; Wang, Liangchun; Wedi, Bettina; Xepapadaki, Paraskevi; Yücel, Esra; Zalewska-Janowska, Anna; Zhao, Zuotao; Zuberbier, Torsten; Maurer, Marcus",Allergy,142,11

SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through respiratory droplets produced by coughs or sneezes, as well as aerosols containing viral particles. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is widely used to support respiration in patients with neuromuscular diseases. However, NPPV is also an aerosol-generating procedure. Without appropriate precautions, the risk of spreading the virus is high in NPPV users infected with SARS-CoV-2. At home, self-quarantine is effective in protecting caregivers of patients using NPPV, whereas in hospitals, using a negative pressure room is preferred. As SARS-CoV-2 can survive on surfaces for several days, disinfecting the NPPV machine and the items frequently touched in the room is essential. Setting viral filters is useful for preventing virus transmission and keeping the inside of the NPPV machine clean. Caregivers must wear appropriate personal protective equipment. Furthermore, it should be paid attention to the potential transmission from asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers. During the current pandemic, it is necessary to minimize the risk of transmission among patients using NPPV.","Fujita, Hiroaki; Suzuki, Keisuke",Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,142,19

The recommendations are intended for use by a interdisciplinary team of clinicians across a wide range of settings and highlight key elements involved in prehospital and Emergency Department care, acute treatments for ischemic stroke, and acute inpatient care. The most notable changes included in this 6th edition are the renaming of the module and its integration of the formerly separate modules on prehospital and emergency care and acute inpatient stroke care. The new module, Acute Stroke Management: Prehospital, Emergency Department, and Acute Inpatient Stroke Care is now a single, comprehensive module addressing the most important aspects of acute stroke care delivery. Other notable changes include the removal of two sections related to the emergency management of intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. These topics are covered in a new, dedicated module, to be released later this year. The most significant recommendation updates are for neuroimaging; the extension of the time window for endovascular thrombectomy treatment out to 24 h; considerations for treating a highly selected group of people with stroke of unknown time of onset; and recommendations for dual antiplatelet therapy for a limited duration after acute minor ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack. This module also emphasizes the need for increased public and healthcare provider's recognition of the signs of stroke and immediate actions to take; the important expanding role of paramedics and all emergency medical services personnel; arriving at a stroke-enabled Emergency Department without delay; and launching local healthcare institution code stroke protocols. Revisions have also been made to the recommendations for the triage and assessment of risk of recurrent stroke after transient ischemic attack/minor stroke and suggested urgency levels for investigations and initiation of management strategies. The goal of this updated guideline is to optimize stroke care across Canada, by reducing practice variations and reducing the gap between current knowledge and clinical practice.","Boulanger, J M; Lindsay, M P; Gubitz, G; Smith, E E; Stotts, G; Foley, N; Bhogal, S; Boyle, K; Braun, L; Goddard, T; Heran, Mks; Kanya-Forster, N; Lang, E; Lavoie, P; McClelland, M; O'Kelly, C; Pageau, P; Pettersen, J; Purvis, H; Shamy, M; Tampieri, D; vanAdel, B; Verbeek, R; Blacquiere, D; Casaubon, L; Ferguson, D; Hegedus, Y; Jacquin, G J; Kelly, M; Kamal, N; Linkewich, B; Lum, C; Mann, B; Milot, G; Newcommon, N; Poirier, P; Simpkin, W; Snieder, E; Trivedi, A; Whelan, R; Eustace, M; Smitko, E; Butcher, K",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,142,1

Importantly, this early protective capacity of MVA vaccination completely depends on virus-specific cytotoxic CD8(+) T cell responses. We used MVA vaccination in the mousepox challenge model using ECTV infection to investigate the previously unknown factors required to elicit rapid protective T cell immunity in normal C57BL/6 mice and in mice lacking the interferon alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR(-/-)). We found a minimal dose of 10(5) PFU of MVA vaccine fully sufficient to allow robust protection against lethal mousepox, as assessed by the absence of disease symptoms and failure to detect ECTV in organs from vaccinated animals. Moreover, MVA immunization at low dosage also protected IFNAR(-/-) mice, indicating efficient activation of cellular immunity even in the absence of type I interferon signaling. When monitoring for virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses in mice vaccinated with the minimal protective dose of MVA, we found significantly enhanced levels of antigen-specific T cells in animals that were MVA vaccinated and ECTV challenged compared to mice that were only vaccinated. The initial priming of naive CD8(+) T cells by MVA immunization appears to be highly efficient and, even at low doses, mediates a rapid in vivo burst of pathogen-specific T cells upon challenge. Our findings define striking requirements for protective emergency immunization against severe systemic infections with orthopoxviruses. IMPORTANCE We demonstrate that single-shot low-dose immunizations with vaccinia virus MVA can rapidly induce T cell-mediated protective immunity against lethal orthopoxvirus infections. Our data provide new evidence for an efficient protective capacity of vaccination with replication-deficient MVA. These data are of important practical relevance for public health, as the effectiveness of a safety-tested, next-generation smallpox vaccine based on MVA is still debated. Furthermore, producing sufficient amounts of vaccine is expected to be a major challenge should an outbreak occur. Moreover, prevention of other infections may require rapidly protective immunization; hence, MVA could be an extremely useful vaccine for delivering heterologous T cell antigens, particularly for infectious diseases that fit a scenario of emergency vaccination.","Volz, Asisa; Langenmayer, Martin; Jany, Sylvia; Kalinke, Ulrich; Sutter, Gerd",Journal of virology,142,31

Using a within-subjects design, participants (N = 55) received both active and sham HD-tDCS across 2 sessions while completing a Go/No-Go task in which foods were either associated with response inhibition or response execution. Food craving was measured pre and post stimulation using a standardized questionnaire as well as desire to eat ratings for foods associated with both response inhibition and response execution in the training task. Results revealed no effect of HD-tDCS on reducing state food craving or desire to eat. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were unable to achieve our maximum preplanned sample size or our minimum desired Bayesian evidence strength across all a priori hypotheses; however 6 of the 7 hypotheses converged with moderate or stronger evidence in favor of the null hypothesis over the alternative hypothesis.

Often, rodents and wild animals are identified as important reservoirs for the disease. Twenty-two captive black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) housed within a zoo were examined as part of a routine census and preventive medicine program. During examinations, blood and urine were collected to screen for exposure to, or infection with, leptospirosis. All animals were apparently healthy at the time of examination. Leptospira microscopic agglutination test identified 12 of 22 (54.5%) prairie dogs with antibody titers ≥1 : 100 against Leptospira interrogans serovar bratislava on initial serologic examination. All prairie dogs within this collection were serologically negative for L. interrogans serovars canicola, hardjo, icterohaemorrhagiae, and pomona and Leptospira kirschneri serovar grippotyphosa. Leptospira polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of urine was negative in all animals tested. This report describes evidence that captive prairie dogs may be exposed to leptospirosis, most likely from wild rodent reservoirs; however, serum titers are low, and lack of leptospiral DNA detected by PCR indicates that these captive animals are unlikely to be important reservoirs for the disease.","Olds, June E; Sun, Yaxuan; Baum, David H; Gauger, Phillip",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,142,1

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether there is a difference in procedural volume and cataract surgery between male and female trainees in the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO). METHODS A longitudinal retrospective review of de-identified surgical RANZCO trainee logbook data from 2008 to 2020 was undertaken. Data from 241 trainee logbooks were analysed for: location of training, gender, date of commencement of training, maternity/paternity leave status, number of surgeries observed, assisted, supervised and unsupervised. Surgical cases were grouped as: 1) all surgical cases; 2) complete cataract cases; 3) partial cataract cases. RESULTS Among 241 trainees (40.7% females), 197 263 procedures were performed. Total surgical volume was 21.1% lower at 4 years for females (median 665.5 vs 843.5;p = 0.036). Completed cataract surgery was 21.5% lower at 18 months (median 87.5 vs 111.5; p = 0.022) and 41.7% lower at 4 years (median 216 vs 369;p < 0.001). Interrupted training was significantly more common in females (30.6% vs 0.7%;p < 0.001). However, linear regression analysis did not identify parental leave or duration as a significant predictor for number of completed cataracts (p = 0.206). Complication rate was not different between males and females(p = 0.35). CONCLUSIONS Female trainees completed 41.7% fewer cataract operations at the end of their training compared to male counterparts with the gap widening between years 1 to 4 of training. The current data demonstrates that female and male RANZCO trainees are not receiving equivalent operating experiences. This article is protected by copyright.

Minimally invasive procedures seem to increase the risk of vaginal cuff dehiscence (VCD). Barbed suture is a new class of suture introduced to aid surgeons during laparoscopic suturing, with the aim to reduce operative time, blood loss, and vaginal dehiscence. METHODS We identified all articles that report a series of laparoscopic or robotic-assisted hysterectomy using barbed suture compared to conventional suture for vaginal cuff closure. The main outcome measures were vaginal cuff suturing time, vaginal bleeding, and vaginal dehiscence with or without small bowel evisceration. Suturing time was meta-analyzed as the standardized mean difference, which is the difference in means of two arms divided by pooled standard deviation with 95 % confidence intervals. For vaginal bleeding and dehiscence risk difference were calculated for each study and then meta-analyzed. Fixed models were considered if heterogeneity was low (I (2) < 50 %), otherwise random models were preferred. RESULTS We show that minor bleeding (RD = 0, 95 % CI 0.03-0.03; p value = 0.907) and VCD (RD = -0.01, 95 % CI 0.02-0.00; p value = 0.119) are comparable in minimally invasive hysterectomy with or without the use of barbed suture. The major bleeding (RD = -0.03; 95 % CI 0.05-0.00; p value = 0.047) appears borderline significant, but the difference between the two types of sutures is not high and the upper limit of 95 % IC is equal to 0 so they were considered comparable. Instead, meta-analysis on vaginal cuff suturing time demonstrates that suturing time is reduced with the use of barbed suture (SMD = -0.96, 95 % CI 1.26-0.70; p value <0.001). CONCLUSIONS Barbed suture is safe and well tolerated as traditional sutures and is associated with reduced operative time of laparoscopic vaginal vault closure.","Bogliolo, Stefano; Musacchi, Valentina; Dominoni, Mattia; Cassani, Chiara; Gaggero, Chiara Roberta; De Silvestri, Annalisa; Gardella, Barbara; Spinillo, Arsenio",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,142,28

The vast majority of respondents reduced the frequency of consumption of all types of alcohol. However, when the population was divided into subgroups, this differentiation demonstrated that particular groups are more vulnerable to alcohol misuse. Higher frequency of alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown was most often found in the group of men, people aged 18-24 years, inhabitants of big cities, and remote workers. Besides, significant differences were observed in subpopulations concerning different types of alcohol.

Studies are needed to inform evidence-based infection prevention and control (IP&C) policies. Objective To describe the outcomes of neonates born to mothers with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection and the IP&C practices associated with these outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort analysis reviewed the medical records for maternal and newborn data for all 101 neonates born to 100 mothers positive for or with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 13 to April 24, 2020. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed using Cobas (Roche Diagnostics) or Xpert Xpress (Cepheid) assays. Newborns were admitted to well-baby nurseries (WBNs) (82 infants) and neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) (19 infants) in 2 affiliate hospitals at a large academic medical center in New York, New York. Newborns from the WBNs roomed-in with their mothers, who were required to wear masks. Direct breastfeeding after appropriate hygiene was encouraged. Exposures Perinatal exposure to maternal asymptomatic/mild vs severe/critical COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was newborn SARS-CoV-2 testing results. Maternal COVID-19 status was classified as asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic vs severe/critical. Newborn characteristics and clinical courses were compared across maternal COVID-19 severity. Results In total, 141 tests were obtained from 101 newborns (54 girls [53.5%]) on 0 to 25 days of life (DOL-0 to DOL-25) (median, DOL-1; interquartile range [IQR], DOL-1 to DOL-3). Two newborns had indeterminate test results, indicative of low viral load (2.0%; 95% CI, 0.2%-7.0%); 1 newborn never underwent retesting but remained well on follow-up, and the other had negative results on retesting. Maternal severe/critical COVID-19 was associated with newborns born approximately 1 week earlier (median gestational age, 37.9 [IQR, 37.1-38.4] vs 39.1 [IQR, 38.3-40.2] weeks; P = .02) and at increased risk of requiring phototherapy (3 of 10 [30.0%] vs 6 of 91 [7.0%]; P = .04) compared with newborns of mothers with asymptomatic/mild COVID-19. Fifty-five newborns were followed up in a new COVID-19 Newborn Follow-up Clinic at DOL-3 to DOL-10 and remained well. Twenty of these newborns plus 3 newborns followed up elsewhere had 32 nonroutine encounters documented at DOL-3 to DOL-25, and none had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 6 with negative retesting results. Conclusions and Relevance No clinical evidence of vertical transmission was identified in 101 newborns of mothers positive for or with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, despite most newborns rooming-in and direct breastfeeding practices.","Dumitriu, Dani; Emeruwa, Ukachi N; Hanft, Erin; Liao, Grace V; Ludwig, Elizabeth; Walzer, Lauren; Arditi, Brittany; Saslaw, Minna; Andrikopoulou, Maria; Scripps, Tessa; Baptiste, Caitlin; Khan, Adrita; Breslin, Noelle; Rubenstein, David; Simpson, Lynn L; Kyle, Margaret H; Friedman, Alexander M; Hirsch, Daniel S; Miller, Russell S; Fernández, Cristina R; Fuchs, Karin M; Keown, M Kathleen; Glassman, Melissa E; Stephens, Ashley; Gupta, Archana; Sultan, Sally; Sibblies, Caroline; Whittier, Susan; Abreu, Wanda; Akita, Francis; Penn, Anna; D'Alton, Mary E; Orange, Jordan S; Goffman, Dena; Saiman, Lisa; Stockwell, Melissa S; Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia",JAMA pediatrics,142,1

The aim of this study was to develop a computer model of a laparoscopic ventral hernia repair and to test different meshes in that model at various intra-abdominal pressures. METHODS Four meshes were tested in a computer model of a ventral hernia. Mechanical failure testing of each mesh was performed in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. A CT scan of a patient with a 5 cm umbilical hernia was used to generate a 3 dimensional model. Meshes were then applied to the model in an intraperitoneal onlay position with a 5 cm overlap. The model was then tested with intraabdominal pressures for standing, coughing and jumping with and without meshes. RESULTS Meshes varied significantly (p < 0.001) in both rupture force 14.8 (5.6) to 78 (5) n/cm and force in which they changed from elastic to plastic 1.6 (0.1) to 14.2 (0.2) n/cm. When applied to the computer model all significantly reduced the strain on the abdominal wall from 17.5% without mesh to less than 1% with mesh. All meshes prevented the hernia from bulging in the model. CONCLUSIONS We have developed a computer model of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair based on engineering principles. This model demonstrated that meshes tested significantly reduced the strain on the abdominal wall. Further studies are required to refine this model in order to best simulate the biomechanics of the abdominal wall.","Qandeel, Haitham; Chew, Cindy; Tanner, K E; O'Dwyer, Patrick J",Surgical endoscopy,142,25

MSCs have been studied in clinical trials of autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders, refractory GvHD and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). MSCs can be isolated and expanded from multiple tissues, including umbilical cord (UC). A number of clinical studies demonstrated safety and feasibility of UCMSCs therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 ARDS. UC-derived MSCs are easily available and can be quickly expanded to relevant numbers. UC-MSCs have an extended population doubling capacity and express low levels of class I and class II leukocyte antigen, which may reduce alloreactivity. To meet clinical manufacture demands, UC-MSC production requires an innovative, scaled-up manufacturing platform. We describe the manufacturing strategy developed in support of a double-blind, randomized, controlled UC- MSC clinical trial in subjects with COVID-19 ARDS. Methods, Results & Conclusion: UC-MSC Final Product was manufactured from the master cell bank (MCB) derived from subepithelial lining of a UC from a healthy term delivery, in cGMP conditions. Utilizing a 2D culture xenogeneic protein-free process, UC-MSC MCB was culture-expanded during 3 expansion cycles, in tissue culture treated vessels with increased surface area for each expansion, in commercially available tissue culture media supplemented with platelet lysate. Cells were harvested during log phase, at 75-80% confluence. The manufacturing process yielded ~ 300x increase in total viable cells at the end of the last expansion cycle. The Final Product was cryopreserved using a controlled rate freezer. Each subject in the treatment group received two doses of 100×106 UC-MSCs. A single UC-MSC Final Product batch was sufficient to treat all subjects randomized to the treatment group and complete the trial. The final product was tested for identity (label verification), effectiveness by viable cell dose and cell viability (>80%), safety by assessment of endotoxin (<1.65 EU/ml), Mycoplasma (negative), 14-day Sterility (negative) and purity by [Figure presented] FLOW cytometry (CD90/CD105?>90%, CD34/CD45 <10%). UC-MSC cell doses prepared for infusion produced similar results to UC-MSC Final Product when tested to confirm product identity, effectiveness, safety and purity. The developed 2D culture and expansion process can be successfully scaled up without compromising integrity of the final UC-MSC product.","Linetsky, E.; Lanzoni, G.; Wang, X.; Leñero, C.; Patel, A.; Ricordi, C.",Cytotherapy,142,25

To identify therapeutically targetable mechanisms that are critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, here we elucidated the Master Regulator (MR) proteins representing mechanistic determinants of the gene expression signature induced by SARS-CoV-2. The analysis revealed coordinated inactivation of MR-proteins linked to regulatory programs potentiating efficiency of viral replication (detrimental host MR-signature) and activation of MR-proteins governing innate immune response programs (beneficial MR-signature). To identify MR-inverting compounds capable of rescuing activity of inactivated host MR-proteins, with-out adversely affecting the beneficial MR-signature, we developed the ViroTreat algorithm. Overall, >80% of drugs predicted to be effective by this methodology induced significant reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection, without affecting cell viability.

However, extracellular histones trigger inflammatory responses and contribute to death in sepsis by unknown mechanisms. We recently reported that inflammasome activation and pyroptosis trigger coagulation activation through a tissue factor (TF)-dependent mechanism. Here, we show that histones trigger coagulation activation in vivo as evidenced by coagulation parameters and fibrin deposition in tissues. However, histone-induced coagulopathy was neither dependent on caspase 1/11 and gasdermin D (GSDMD), nor on TLR2 and TLR4, as deficiency of these genes in mice did not protect against histone-induced coagulopathy. Incubation of histones with macrophages induced lytic cell death and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, which is required for TF activity, a key initiator of coagulation.

The drug discovery process for antibody therapeutic candidates however is time-and cost-intensive and heavily reliant on in-vivo and in-vitro high throughput screens. Here, we introduce a framework for structure-based deep learning for antibodies (DLAB) which can virtually screen putative binding antibodies against antigen targets of interest. DLAB is built to be able to predict antibody-antigen binding for antigens with no known antibody binders. We demonstrate that DLAB can be used both to improve antibody-antigen docking and structure-based virtual screening of antibody drug candidates. DLAB enables improved pose ranking for antibody docking experiments as well as selection of antibody-antigen pairings for which accurate poses are generated and correctly ranked. We also show that DLAB can identify binding antibodies against specific antigens in a case study. Our results demonstrate the promise of deep learning methods for structure-based virtual screening of antibodies.","Schneider, Constantin; Buchanan, Andrew; Taddese, Bruck; Deane, Charlotte M.",bioRxiv,142,1

These restrictions have forced many to embrace ‘hyperlocal’ approaches to adventure and provided an opportunity to reimagine our adventure travel philosophies and practices. Despite claims that traditional adventure travel could address some of the “world’s most pressing challenges”, it has largely failed to realize its potential to provide a range of social, economic, and environmental benefits. Conversely, microadventure, which espouses adventures in nearby nature that are low-carbon and human-scaled, is an enticing alternative for both current and post-pandemic conditions. This essay first critiques pre-pandemic adventure travel and describes the hazards of this approach in age of COVID-19. It then explores creative ‘lockdown’ microadventures; envisions what post-pandemic adventure may look like; and explains why we not only need to embrace microadventures in a post-pandemic world, but also why we may prefer them to traditional adventure travel.","Mackenzie, Susan Houge; Goodnow, Jasmine",Leis.

To date, studies have not directly compared hyperglycemic crises in patients with and without COVID-19. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 55 patients admitted to an urban academic medical center since 3/1/2020 meeting laboratory criteria for DKA, HHS, or mixed DKA/HHS were grouped by COVID-19 status per RT-PCR testing and compared (see table). Data were collected by electronic and manual chart abstraction. Diabetes type was adjudicated by an endocrinologist. The whole cohort (mean age 55 ± 17 years) was 53% male, 55% black, 13% white, and 20% Hispanic. There were similar proportions of DKA, HHS, and mixed cases between patients with and without COVID. Compared to those without COVID, patients with COVID had lower anion gap, higher pH and beta-hydroxybutyrate, were more likely to have type 2 diabetes (T2D, 76% vs. 53%) and less likely to have T1D (8% vs. 33%), were 4-times more likely to receive glucocorticoids (88% vs. 20%), had nearly double the length of stay (LOS, 14.1 ± 14.9 vs. 7.4 ± 7.0, p=0.03) and 4-fold higher odds of mortality (OR 4.42 [0.81-24.28], p=0.09). These data suggest there are differences in hyperglycemic emergencies between patients hospitalized with and without COVID, most notably a more frequent history of T2D, longer LOS and greater mortality.","Shah, Arnav A.; Silfani, Elayna Deak Andrew Koppin Christina Allen Shaneisha Zisman-Ilani Yaara Rose Christina Sirisena Imali Rubin Daniel J.",Diabetes,142,1

New diseases emerge annually and place enormous burdens on many countries. Additionally, using humans to handle pandemic situations increases the chances of disease spreading. Therefore, various technologies that do not directly involve humans should be employed to handle pandemic situations. The Internet of Drones (IoDT), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain are emerging technologies that have revolutionized the modern world. This article presents a blockchain-based AI-empowered pandemic situation supervision scheme in which a swarm of drones embedded with AI is engaged to autonomously monitor pandemic outbreaks, thereby keeping human involvement as low as possible. A use case based on a recent pandemic (i.e., COVID-19) is discussed. Two types of drone swarms are used to handle multiple tasks (e.g., checking face masks and imposing lockdowns). A lightweight blockchain is considered to handle situations in remote areas with poor network connectivity. Additionally, a two-phase lightweight security mechanism is adopted to validate the entities in the proposed scheme. A proof of concept is established using an experimental environment setup and dataset training. An analysis of the experimental results demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed scheme.","Islam, A.; Rahim, T.; Masuduzzaman, M.; Shin, S. Y.",Ieee Wireless Communications,142,25

However, a major issue when using compartmental mathematical models concerns the time-invariant formulation of hyper-parameters that prevent the model from following the evolution over time of the epidemiological phenomenon under investigation. In order to cope with this problem, the present work suggests an alternative hybrid approach based on Machine Learning that avoids recalculation of hyper-parameters and only uses an initial set. This study shows that the proposed hybrid approach makes it possible to correct the expected loss of accuracy observed in the compartmental model when the considered time horizon increases. As a case study, a basic compartmental model has been designed and tested to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations during the first and the second pandemic waves in Lombardy, Italy. The model is based on an extended formulation of the contact function that allows modelling of the trend of personal contacts throughout the reference period. Moreover, the scenario analysis proposed in this work can help policy-makers select the most appropriate containment measures to reduce hospitalizations and relieve pressure on the health system, but also to limit any negative impact on the economic and social systems.","Gatto, Andrea Accarino Gabriele Aloisi Valeria Immorlano Francesco Donato Francesco Aloisio Giovanni",Informatics,142,13

Currently, no licensed vaccine is available. Previously we showed that vaccination of transgenic mice with ChAdOx1 MERS, encoding the MERS S protein, prevented disease upon lethal challenge. In the current study we show that rhesus macaques seroconverted rapidly after a single intramuscular vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS. Upon MERS-CoV challenge vaccinated animals were protected against respiratory injury and pneumonia and had a reduction in viral load in lung tissue of several logs. Furthermore, we did not detect MERS-CoV replication in type I and II pneumocytes of ChAdOx1 MERS vaccinated animals. A prime-boost regimen of ChAdOx1 MERS boosted antibody titers, and viral replication was completely absent from the respiratory tract tissue of these rhesus macaques. Finally, we investigated the ability of ChAdOx1 MERS to protect against six different MERS-CoV strains, isolated between 2012 to 2018, from dromedary camels and humans in the Middle East and Africa. Antibodies elicited by ChAdOx1 MERS in rhesus macaques were able to neutralize all MERS-CoV strains. Vaccination of transgenic hDPP4 mice with ChAdOx1 MERS completely protected the animals against disease and lethality for all different MERS-CoV strains. The data support further clinical development of ChAdOx1 MERS supported by CEPI.

The number of their users and consequently, the demand in such platforms are also rising. Quarantine restrictions and regulations related to COVID-19 revealed the problems of organizing both communication and leisure activities online. Since the advent of instant messengers in the 1990s, people have learned to communicate in a hybrid mode and to find friends over the Internet. Online communication, however, has always been occasional and could easily be switched to offline interaction. In view of the imposed restrictions during the pandemic, people were forced to stay isolated. The impact of the restrictions on organized leisure activities for children was also damaging. Online leisure activities were presented at best by online team games. Such online games, however, cannot replace the educational goals and learning outcomes of offline activities. From spring to summer 2020, all Russian schoolchildren and students studied online on various educational platforms. While several models of distance learning and teaching were implemented in the field of education (via Zoom, Microsoft Teams and other platforms), leisure activities were not adapted to an online format. At the same time, organized leisure activities are recognized as the main means for the socialization of children. It is noteworthy that the primary school age group became the most vulnerable. Our research aim was to analyze modern interactive platforms, identify their potential in organizing leisure activities, and determine the conditions for using the platform “Round” for leisure activities of primary school children.

The aim of the article is to present the most important research findings, concerning immigrants and enterprises where they are employed. This issue also includes the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors of this paper focused mostly on Ukrainian immigrants. It has been proven that increase in the number of immigrant workers leads to the growth of the Gross Domestic Product, and contributes to the faster growth in remittances from the Republic of Poland to Ukraine. As a result of the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sales, non-employment costs were reduced in the service and industrial sectors. Employment changes were not correlated with company’s situation. It is worth noting, that because of the COVID-19 pandemic, some companies may be less inclined to recruit immigrants in the near future, and the overall demand for labor may decrease. This is particularly important, because the primary reason for employment people from abroad was the inability to meet labor needs of the citizens of Poland. The majority of immigrants are employed only to perform physical work which does not require qualifications. Large companies show greater interest in the foreign human capital. Over the past five years, there has been an increase in the number of immigrants who declared their intention to stay in Poland for a longer period of time. More than half of the immigrants stay in Poland, with at least, one family member. On this basis, it may be concluded that the number of immigrants willing to settle in Poland is growing.","Dudzik, Iwona Brukwicka Irena",VUZF Review,142,13

Evaluation of multidisciplinary team (MDT) remote consultations,13.893481,7.4882226,2021,"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly stressed healthcare systems. The addition of monoclonal antibody (mAb) infusions, which prevent severe disease and reduce hospitalizations, to the repertoire of COVID-19 countermeasures offers the opportunity to reduce system stress but requires strategic planning and use of novel approaches. Our objective was to develop a web-based decision-support tool to help existing and future mAb infusion facilities make better and more informed staffing and capacity decisions. Materials and Methods: Using real-world observations from three medical centers operating with federal field team support, we developed a discrete-event simulation model and performed simulation experiments to assess performance of mAb infusion sites under different conditions. Results: 162,000 scenarios were evaluated by simulations. Our analyses revealed that it was more effective to add check-in staff than to add additional nurses for middle-to-large size sites with [≥] 2 infusion nurses; that scheduled appointments performed better than walk-ins when patient load was not high; and that reducing infusion time was particularly impactful when load on resources was only slightly above manageable levels. Discussion: Physical capacity, check-in staff, and infusion time were as important as nurses for mAb sites. Health systems can effectively operate an infusion center under different conditions to provide mAb therapeutics even with relatively low investments in physical resources and staff. Conclusion: Simulations of mAb infusion sites were used to create a capacity planning tool to optimize resource utility and allocation in constrained pandemic conditions, and more efficiently treat COVID-19 patients at existing and future mAb infusion sites.","Caglayan, C.; Thornhill, J.; Stewart, M.

CI-AKI was defined as an increase of 25% or more, or an absolute increase of 0.5 mg/dl or more in serum creatinine from baseline value, assessed at 48 hours following the administration of the contrast. The primary endpoint was the development of a new coronavirus infection. Results. We found statistically significant difference in the prevalence of the allergic reaction to iodine (rho=0.0178) between non-COVID and COVID-patients group. Also, there were statistically significant differences in the secondary endpoints: renal replacement therapy (rho=0.0178) and repeated percutaneous coronary intervention in the last year (rho=0.0112) were more common among patients with coronavirus. The difference in the prevalence of arterial hypertension was near to statistical significance (rho=0.0882). Conclusion. COVID-patients with CI-AKI had more allergic reactions to iodine than non-COVID patients. The trend of more common arterial hypertension between COVID-patients was found in our research. There were not any statistical significant differences in other risk factors. There were statistically significant difference in the secondary endpoints such as repeated percutaneous coronary intervention and renal replacement therapy.

However, the purpose of this paper is to focus on the impact of the pandemic in Hajj and Umrah by exploring its impact on different stakeholders affecting its disruption due to the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: This is a library-based study that uses qualitative method to explore the impact of COVID-19 on Hajj and Umrah. Thus, provisions of Quran and hadith on Hajj and Umrah were examined as primary data for the research to establish the importance of the rituals in Islam. Guidelines set by Hajj regulators and instruments enabling them in that behalf were examined likewise. In addition, content analyses were made of relevant secondary data from published sources including articles, books, newspapers and web resources that embody scholarly, scientific and religious views on the issue being studied. Findings: It is realised that in the first year of the pandemic, while Umrah is entirely suspended, Hajj was scaled back and performed by 10,000 people altogether, a tiny segment of the over two and half million that partook in the ritual previously. Hajj and Umrah have been greatly inhibited and jeopardised by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in religious, social, economic, psychological effects on the eligible but affected Muslims and Muslims countries. Along these lines, recommendations were accordingly proffered on the way forward to better Hajj and Umrah management. Originality/value: It is anticipated that the findings of the research would assist policy makers to comprehend the impact of the pandemic on Hajj and Umrah to ensure that the policies they make in this regard would adequately cover every aspect affecting the stakeholders which is deliberated in this research.

Demographics, clinical features and stone characteristics and treatment were noted.ResultsSeventy nine percent of the 38 patients who present in 2019 had ureteric stones, compared to 85% of the 40 patients in 2020. Distal stones made up 53% in 2019, compared to 56% in 2020. Less patients were noted to be febrile in 2020(13%vs35%).There was an increase in conservative management in 2020 (25% vs 21%). Emergency treatment (stent/nephrostomy) with secondary intervention (Ureterorenoscopy(URS)/Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL)) was markedly reduced in 2020(12.5% vs 42%).More patients were also treated with primary interventions (URS/PCNL) within 48 hours (43% in 2020 vs 26%) and 7 days (13% vs 8%).ConclusionMore patients were treated with conservative treatments and early primary interventions. This was done in order to combat unnecessary hospital admissions and stays, as well as surgeries and anaesthesia, whilst minimising stone and stent complications. An improved adherence to GIRFT guideless was also noted, providing better patient care and outcome, whilst reducing unnecessary procedures.","Woo, Caroline Mohammed Kamil Quraishi Gabriel Joseph Mackie Simon Watson Graham",BMJ Leader,142,2

Amentoflavone is a biflavonoid found in the herbal extracts of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), Gingko biloba, Selaginella tamariscina, Torreya nucifera, and many other plants. Its pharmacological actions have been listed as antiviral, antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antidepressant, and neuroprotective. Molecular docking studies have found that amentoflavone binds strongly to the active site of the main protease (Mpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). As conventional antiviral medications are met with limited success against coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and vaccines are one of the only weapons against COVID-19 in the pharmaceutical armamentarium, traditional medicines are being considered for the forefront battle against COVID-19. Clinical studies with Hypericum and Gingko extract as additional or alternative drugs/supplements are registered. Here we review the potential of amentoflavone, an active agent in both Hypericum and Gingko extract as an adjunct therapy for COVID-19. Its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and sepsis preventive actions could provide protection against the ""cytokine storm."" Compared with the herbal extracts, which induce cytochrome P450 (CYP) and uridine 5'-diphospho (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) activity producing a negative herb-drug interaction, amentoflavone is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and UGT.

The molecular details of the early steps in NMD are not fully understood but previous work suggests that NMD activation occurs as a consequence of ribosome stalling at the termination codon (TC). To test this hypothesis, we established an in vitro translation-coupled toeprinting assay based on lysates from human cells that allows monitoring of ribosome occupancy at the TC of reporter mRNAs. In contrast to the prevailing NMD model, our in vitro system revealed similar ribosomal occupancy at the stop codons of NMD-sensitive and NMD-insensitive reporter mRNAs. Moreover, ribosome profiling revealed a similar density of ribosomes at the TC of endogenous NMD-sensitive and NMD-insensitive mRNAs in vivo. Together, these data show that NMD activation is not accompanied by stable stalling of ribosomes at TCs.","Karousis, Evangelos D.; Gurzeler, Lukas-Adrian; Annibaldis, Giuditta; Dreos, René; Mühlemann, Oliver",bioRxiv,142,17

By analyzing incidence data, estimated susceptible population size, and climate data with methods based on nonlinear time series analysis (collectively referred to as empirical dynamic modeling), we identified drivers and their interactive effects on dengue dynamics in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Climatic forcing arose only when susceptible availability was high: temperature and rainfall had net positive and negative effects, respectively. By capturing mechanistic, nonlinear, and context-dependent effects of population susceptibility, temperature, and rainfall on dengue transmission empirically, our model improves forecast skill over recent, state-of-the-art models for dengue incidence. Together, these results provide empirical evidence that the interdependence of host population susceptibility and climate drive dengue dynamics in a nonlinear and complex, yet predictable way.","Nova, Nicole; Deyle, Ethan R.; Shocket, Marta S.; MacDonald, Andrew J.; Childs, Marissa L.; Rypdal, Martin; Sugihara, George; Mordecai, Erin A.",bioRxiv,142,1

Purpose: Estimate the IFR of COVID-19 in community-dwelling elderly populations and other age groups from seroprevalence studies. Study protocol: https://osf.io/47cgb. Data Sources: Seroprevalence studies done in 2020 and identified by any of four existing systematic reviews. Study Selection: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies with [≥]1000 participants aged [≥]70 years that presented seroprevalence in elderly people; aimed to generate samples reflecting the general population; and whose location had available data on cumulative COVID-19 deaths in elderly (primary cutoff [≥]70 years; [≥]65 or [≥]60 also eligible). Data Extraction: We extracted the most fully adjusted (if unavailable, unadjusted) seroprevalence estimates and sampling procedure details. We also extracted age- and residence-stratified cumulative COVID-19 deaths (until 1 week after the seroprevalence sampling midpoint) from official reports, and population statistics, to calculate IFRs corrected for unmeasured antibody types. Sample size-weighted IFRs were estimated for countries with multiple estimates. Secondary analyses examined data on younger age strata from the same studies. Data Synthesis: Twenty-three seroprevalence surveys representing 14 countries were included. Across all countries, the median IFR in community-dwelling elderly and elderly overall was 2.4% (range 0.3%-7.2%) and 5.5% (range 0.3%-12.1%). IFR was higher with larger proportions of people >85 years. Younger age strata had low IFR values (median 0.0027%, 0.014%, 0.031%, 0.082%, 0.27%, and 0.59%, at 0-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60-69 years). Limitations: Biases in seroprevalence and mortality data. Conclusions: The IFR of COVID-19 in community-dwelling elderly people is lower than previously reported.

In the present work, we addressed the question of whether TGEV tropism is determined only by the virus-receptor interaction. To this end, different non-permissive cell lines were transfected with the porcine APN cDNA and tested for their susceptibility to TGEV infection. The four transfected cell lines shown to express pAPN at their membrane became sensitive to infection. Two of these cell lines were found to be defective for the production of viral particles. This suggests that other factor(s) than pAPN expression may be involved in the production of infectious virions. The pAPN-transfected cells were also tested for their susceptibility to several viruses which have a close antigenic relationship to TGEV. So far, we failed to evidence permissivity to the feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus FIPV and canine coronavirus CCV. In contrast, we found clear evidence that porcine respiratory coronavirus PRCV, a variant of TGEV which replicates efficiently in the respiratory tract but to a very low extent in the gut, may also utilise APN to gain entry into the host cells. This suggests that the switch between TGEV and PRCV tropisms in vivo may involve other determinant(s) than receptor recognition.","Delmas, B; Gelfi, J; Sjöström, H; Noren, O; Laude, H",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,142,1

METHODS The study group includes 70 patients with bilateral and monolateral recurrent inguinal hernia undergoing transabdominal preperitoneal repair (TAPP) in the period 2011-2013. A polypropylene mesh was fixed in group A (N.=35) with titanium tacks (EndoUniversal stapler, Covidien) or in group B (N.=35) with synthetic cyanoacrylate glue (Glubran-2, GEM). Patient outcome was assessed by the following variables: sex, mean age, ASA score, intra- and postoperative morbidity, hospitalization, postoperative acute and chronic pain, recurrence rate. The observation period was 24 months, with a mean follow-up of 10.5 months (range, 1-23) for Group A and 11 months (range, 2-24) for Group B. RESULTS No difference between the two groups was observed with respect to mean operative time and hospitalization. In all cases, surgery was successfully concluded laparoscopically. Intraoperative complications occurred in 1 patient of the group A and consisted of a urinary bladder injury, which was immediately sutured. Postoperative complication rate was 5.7% (4 patients, of whom 3 in group A and 1 in group B). In each group we detected one recurrence within 6 (group A) and 18 months (group B) postsurgery; both patients were treated with a re-TAPP. Postoperative pain at 6 months from surgery, measured by visual analogue score (VAS), was reported by 4 patients in the group A and in no case of the group B (P=0.04). CONCLUSION Data from this study demonstrate the advantages of synthetic cyanoacrylate glue for mesh fixation in laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair, compared to titanium tacks. The use of this surgical glue was associated with a significantly reduced risk for developing chronic groin pain and a shortened hospital stay. Nevertheless, further studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm our encouraging results.","Burza, A; Avantifiori, R; Curinga, R; Santini, E; Delle Site, P; Stipa, F",Minerva chirurgica,142,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the charts of children who underwent laparoscopic urological procedures on the upper urinary tract at our institution between 2006 and 2012. These procedures consisted of nephrectomies, nephroureterectomies and heminephroureterectomies. The operations were performed retroperitoneoscopically with three trocars. The specimens were removed intact through the primary trocar site. RESULTS A total of 30 retroperitoneoscopic ablative surgeries were performed in 13 girls and 17 boys. The mean patient age was 7.8 ± 4.3 years (range, 1-14 years). The interventions consisted of nephrectomy in 10 cases (33.3%), nephroureterectomy in 17 cases (56.6%) and heminephroureterectomy in 3 (10%) cases. The open conversion rate was 3.3% (1/30). The difference between the initial 10 cases and the latter 20 cases, in terms of mean operative time, was statistically significant (144.5 vs. 115.78 minutes, respectively, P = .031). Apart from 3 nephroureterectomies, all of the procedures (86.6%) were completed successfully using three trocars only, without the need for a separate extraction incision. The patients were hospitalized for a mean duration of 2.2 days (range, 2-4 days). None of the patients required blood transfusion. We did not encounter any major perioperative or postoperative complication. CONCLUSION Retroperitoneoscopic renal ablative surgery is a safe and effective treatment alternative for a variety of upper urinary tract disorders in children.","Oktar, Tayfun; Sanli, Oner; Acar, Ömer; Tefik, Tzevat; Karakus, Serkan; Ziylan, Orhan",Urology journal,142,19

The spike protein exists in two structurally distinct conformations, prefusion and postfusion. The transition from prefusion to postfusion conformation of the spike protein must be triggered, leading to membrane fusion. This article reviews current knowledge about the structures and functions of coronavirus spike proteins, illustrating how the two S1 domains recognize different receptors and how the spike proteins are regulated to undergo conformational transitions. I further discuss the evolution of these two critical functions of coronavirus spike proteins, receptor recognition and membrane fusion, in the context of the corresponding functions from other viruses and host cells.","Li, Fang",Annual review of virology,142,1

The push in recent years toward reducing the number of ports required to perform this surgery has led to the development of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC). We report our early experience with SILC and assess its feasibility and safety. METHODS A prospective study was conducted of the first 100 patients who presented with complaints of biliary colic and underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy via the single-port technique at our institution. SILC was performed via a single-port device such as a flexible umbilical port that could accommodate up to three surgical instruments. The port was inserted into a transumbilical incision around 15-20 mm long. Data on operative details and postoperative outcomes were collected and evaluated. RESULTS The mean operation time was 67.8 minutes. Six patients needed conversion, requiring extra 5-mm ports to complete the surgery. No serious intraoperative complications, such as bile duct injury or bile leakage, were encountered. Cosmesis from the scar hidden within the umbilical fold was excellent. CONCLUSION Our initial results of single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy are promising, with no complications being seen in this early series. However, the drawbacks include the higher cost of equipment and a steeper learning curve. Further evaluation is required to assess the risks and benefits of this approach when compared with conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","Chang, Stephen Kin Yong; Tan, Shaun Shi Yan; Kok, Yee Onn",Singapore medical journal,142,17

Specific diagnosis therefore relies on laboratory investigation. This study developed and evaluated five groups of multiplex nested PCR assays that could simultaneously detect 21 different respiratory pathogens: influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1); influenza B virus; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, 4a, and 4b; respiratory syncytial virus A and B; human rhinoviruses; human enteroviruses; human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; human metapneumoviruses; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; Legionella pneumophila; and adenoviruses (A to F). These multiplex nested PCRs adopted fast PCR technology. The high speed of fast PCR (within 35 min) greatly improved the efficiency of these assays. The results show that these multiplex nested PCR assays are specific and more sensitive (100- to 1,000-fold) than conventional methods. Among the 303 clinical specimens tested, the multiplex nested PCR achieved an overall positive rate of 48.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 42.9 to 54.1%), which was significantly higher than that of virus isolation (20.1% [95% CI, 15.6 to 24.6%]) and that of direct detection by immunofluorescence assay (13.5% [95% CI, 9.7 to 17.4%]). The improved sensitivity was partly due to the higher sensitivity of multiplex nested PCR than that of conventional methods in detecting cultivatable viruses. Moreover, the ability of the multiplex nested PCR to detect noncultivatable viruses, particularly rhinoviruses, coronavirus OC43, and metapneumoviruses, contributed a major gain (15.6%) in the overall positive rate. In conclusion, rapid multiplex nested PCR assays can improve the diagnostic yield for respiratory infections to allow prompt interventive actions to be taken.","Lam, W Y; Yeung, Apple C M; Tang, Julian W; Ip, Margaret; Chan, Edward W C; Hui, Mamie; Chan, Paul K S",Journal of clinical microbiology,142,17

We show that MHV RNA synthesis requires interactions of multiple RNA components, which are likely mediated by protein-RNA and protein-protein, as well as RNA-RNA, interactions. This virus also provides a unique example of a discontinuous transcription mechanism, which involves a trans-acting RNA component. Finally, study of the cis-acting signals for the various steps of RNA synthesis revealed an insight into the regulation of viral RNA synthesis. This discussion suggests that the regulation of RNA synthesis in coronavirus is more complex than previously thought possible for RNA viruses.

To examine these possibilities, we analyzed the oligosaccharide moieties of the membrane proteins of the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. In addition, we determined the effect of inhibiting the glycosylation of these proteins on viral maturation and infectivity. Infectious bronchitis virus virions contain nine proteins. Four of these proteins, GP36, GP31, GP28, and P23, are closely related structurally and appear to be homologous to the E1 proteins of murine coronaviruses. We found that the oligosaccharides of GP31 and GP28 could be removed with endoglycosidase H and that neither of these glycoproteins was detectable in tunicamycin-treated cells. These two results indicated that GP31 and GP28 contain N-linked oligosaccharides. Therefore, O-linked oligosaccharides are not a universal feature of the small coronavirus membrane glycoproteins. Tunicamycin inhibited glycosylation of all of the viral glycoproteins but did not inhibit production of virions by infectious bronchitis virus-infected cells. The virions released by these cells contained only the three non-glycosylated viral proteins P51, P23, and P14. These particles were not infectious. Therefore, it appears that glycosylated infectious bronchitis virus polypeptides are not required for particle formation. However, the viral glycoproteins are apparently indispensible for viral infectivity.","Stern, D F; Sefton, B M",Journal of virology,142,7

Almost all calves had antibody titers on arrival in the Alberta feedlot and 82% of the calves had an antibody titer on arrival at the Ontario feedlots; titers in calves in Alberta were almost twice as high as those in calves in Ontario. The incidence of infection, in the first mo after arrival as judged by seroconversion, ranged from 61% to 100%; titer increases were much greater in calves in Ontario feedlots. Titer variables were not significantly related to BRD, except on a within-group basis (group was a confounding variable for BCV-BRD associations). Given control of group effects, calves with an antibody titer on arrival appeared to be protected against BRD for the first 28 d in the feedlot, and the association was reasonably linear over the range of titers. Each titer unit on arrival decreased the risk of BRD by about 0.8x (odds ratio). Titer change was not strongly related to the risk of BRD and the relationship was not linear over the range of titer changes. Titer change was strongly and negatively correlated with titer on arrival, and titer change was not significantly related to BRD in the presence of arrival titers. Arrival titer retained its relationship with BRD in the presence of titer data for other putative pathogens. Each higher unit of titer to BCV on arrival increased the 28-day weight gain (controlling for group, initial weight and the occurrence of BRD) by slightly more than 1 kg. Titer change was associated with decreased weight gain, when initial titer was not in the model. The lack of a linear or multivariable association between BCV titer change and BRD, and weight gain, may indicate that BCV is not a major pathogen; or, its lack of significance may merely be due to its strong correlation with arrival titer. Given the associations found in this study, particularly the interprovincial differences in arrival titers, more and different approaches to studying the possible effects of BCV on BRD are in order.","Martin, S W; Nagy, E; Shewen, P E; Harland, R J",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,142,20

The surgery aims to restore joint congruence, correct deformity and decrease pain. There is little literature on the results in the geriatric population. The purpose of this study is intended to demonstrate that the open surgical technique of Lelièvre and Vidalot achieves acceptable radiographic results in that population. MATERIAL AND METHODS 68 patients between 60 and 85 years of age were involved with Lelièvre Technique and Vidalot for moderate to severe HV of Isham, between January 2014 and January 2017. Immediate postoperative and six month radiographs were evaluated with conventional radiometry for this condition; All measurements were made in digital system. The data was entered in Microsoft Excel. p values 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS Out of 68 patients (54 women and 14 men), average age 68.0 years. 12 had bilateral concern. 28 second finger claw. The metatarsphasopalangic angle with a preoperative mean was 36.6o, increased by 100% of cases of intermetatarsal angle 1-2, with a correlation p 0.05 between intermetatarsal angle and metatarsal angle increase. Immediate and six-month post-surgical results with a correlation of p = 0.3107. CONCLUSIONS The treatment of moderate to severe HV in our geriatric population under technique Lelièvre and Vidalot achieves an acceptable correction demonstrated radiographically in the immediate postoperative period and at six month, this translates a viable option of surgical treatment in these population.","Agreda-Santana, A J; Díaz-Carballeda, J D; Rodríguez-Ramos, A",Acta ortopedica mexicana,142,1

To determine the mechanisms that prevent virus spreading through the blood-brain barrier, we analyzed expression of MHVR, a glycoprotein that serves as receptor for mouse hepatitis virus on endothelial cells of cerebral blood vessels. Our results indicated that MHVR was strongly expressed on the endoluminal pole of these cells. In addition, a direct virus binding assay showed that mouse hepatitis virus was able to bind endothelial cells via this receptor. Despite this expression of a functional viral receptor, in normal mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus by the contra-peritoneal route, no in vivo viral replication could be detected in endothelial cells from the brain, contrasting with the equivalent cells from the liver. However, shortly after i.v. administration of sodium dodecylsulfate detergent to the mice, virus infection of some cerebral endothelial cells was detected in a few mice. As a consequence of detergent treatment, virus infection was able to cross the blood-brain barrier. These results suggest that the protective role of the blood-brain barrier against spreading of mouse hepatitis virus A59 into the central nervous system is determined by a specific restriction of viral entry into the endothelial cells of cerebral origin.","Godfraind, C; Havaux, N; Holmes, K V; Coutelier, J P",Journal of neurovirology,142,1

Subversion of GAGs is a pathogenic strategy shared by a wide variety of microbial pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi. Pathogens use GAGs at virtually every major portals of entry to promote their attachment and invasion of host cells, movement from one cell to another, and to protect themselves from immune attack. Pathogens co-opt fundamental activities of GAGs to accomplish these tasks. This ingenious strategy to subvert essential activities of GAGs likely prevented host organisms from deleting or inactivating these mechanisms during their evolution. The goal of this review is to provide a mechanistic overview of our current understanding of how microbes subvert GAGs at major steps of pathogenesis, using select GAG-pathogen interactions as representative examples.","Aquino, Rafael S; Park, Pyong Woo",Frontiers in bioscience,142,9

Most patients have a defect in the cystathionine-beta-synthase, the key enzyme in the conversion of homocysteine to cysteine. Many abnormalities in the connective tissue of patients with homocystinuria resemble those seen in Marfan syndrome, caused by mutations in fibrillin-1. These observations led to the hypothesis that the structure and function of fibrillin-1 is compromised in patients with homocystinuria. To test this hypothesis we produced recombinant human fibrillin-1 fragments spanning the central portion of the molecule (8-Cys/transforming growth factor-beta binding domain 3 to calcium binding EGF domain 22) and extensively analyzed the potential of homocysteine to modify structural and functional properties of these proteins. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed moderate changes of their secondary structures after incubation with homocysteine. Equilibrium dialysis demonstrated a number of high affinity calcium binding sites in the tandemly repeated calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like domains 11-22. Calcium binding of homocysteine-modified fragments was completely abolished. Incubation of the recombinant proteins with homocysteine rendered the analyzed calcium binding EGF domains as well as the 8-Cys/transforming growth factor-beta binding domain 3 significantly more susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Furthermore, data were obtained demonstrating that homocysteine can covalently modify fibrillin-1 via disulfide bonds. These data strongly suggest that structural and functional modifications as well as degradation processes of fibrillin-1 in the connective tissues of patients with homocystinuria play a major role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.","Hubmacher, Dirk; Tiedemann, Kerstin; Bartels, Rainer; Brinckmann, Jürgen; Vollbrandt, Tillman; Bätge, Boris; Notbohm, Holger; Reinhardt, Dieter P",The Journal of biological chemistry,142,16

METHODS: HALO CM was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with CM. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with fremanezumab quarterly (675 mg at baseline, placebo at weeks 4 and 8), fremanezumab monthly (225 mg at baseline, weeks 4 and 8), or placebo. This manuscript assessed the effect of treatment with fremanezumab on health-related quality of life and productivity using the following prespecified assessments: the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life (MSQoL) questionnaire at baseline, weeks 4, 8, 12; Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) questionnaire at weeks 4, 8, 12; EuroQoL 5-dimension, 5-response level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: General Health (WPAI:GH) questionnaire at baseline and week 12. RESULTS: The full analysis set included 1121 patients: 375 patients with quarterly dosing, 375 with monthly dosing, and 371 with placebo. Fremanezumab quarterly and monthly was associated with significant improvements over placebo in change from baseline mean scores in MSQoL domains (all, p < 0.05) to week 12. At week 12, fremanezumab also showed significant improvements in EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale (p < 0.05) and PGIC scores (p < 0.0001); as well as significant reductions from baseline in WPAI:GH scores (p < 0.01) and presenteeism (impairment while working; p < 0.05) vs placebo.

However, whether infected HCW acquire protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. Here, we characterized SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in Norwegian HCW in a prospective cohort study. METHODS: We enrolled 607 HCW pre- and post-the first COVID-19-pandemic wave. Exposure history, COVID-19-like symptoms and serum samples were collected. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were characterized by spike-protein IgG/IgM/IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent and live-virus neutralization assays. RESULTS: Spike-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies increased after the first pandemic wave in HCW with COVID-19-patient exposure, but not in HCW without patient exposure. Thirty-two HCW (5.3%) had spike-specific antibodies (11 seroconverted with &#8805;4-fold increase, 21 were seropositive at baseline). Neutralizing antibodies were found in 11 HCW that seroconverted, of whom 4 (36.4%) were asymptomatic. Ninety-seven HCW were tested by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during follow-up, 8 were positive (7 seroconverted and 1 had undetectable antibodies). CONCLUSIONS: We found increases in SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in infected HCW, especially after COVID-19-patient exposure.

The overall mortality was 30%, with comparatively higher mortality among cases (42% vs. 18%; p = 0.009). There was no difference between procalcitonin levels in both groups (p = 0.883). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, significant independent association was found with severe/critical COVID-19 at presentation (AOR: 4.42 times; 95% CI: 1.63-11.9) and use of steroids (AOR: 4.60; 95% CI: 1.24-17.05). Notably, 64% of controls were administered antibiotics despite the absence of bacterial coinfection or secondary infection. Risk factors for bacterial infections in moderate to critically ill patients with COVID-19 include critical illness at presentation and use of steroids. There is widespread empiric antibiotic utilization in those without bacterial infection.","Nasir, Nosheen; Rehman, Fazal; Omair, Syed Furrukh",J Med Virol,142,16

These infections manifest as bronchitis, pneumonia or severe, sometimes fatal, respiratory illness. The novel coronavirus seems to be associated with milder infections but it has spread globally more rapidly becoming a pandemic. This review summarises the state of the art of nanotechnology-based affinity biosensors for SARS, MERS and COVID-19 detection. The nanobiosensors are antibody- or DNA-based biosensors with electrochemical, optical or FET-based transduction. Various kinds of nanomaterials, such as metal nanoparticles, nanowires and graphene, have been merged to the affinity biosensors to enhance their analytical performances. The advantages of the use of the nanomaterials are highlighted, and the results compared with those obtained using non-nanostructured biosensors. A critical comparison with conventional methods, such as RT-PCR and ELISA, is also reported. It is hoped that this review will provide interesting information for the future development of new reliable nano-based platforms for point-of-care diagnostic devices for COVID-19 prevention and control.","Antiochia, Riccarda",Mikrochim Acta,142,20

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of these indicators in COVID-19 with different severity. Methods Clinical data of 46 patients with severe COVID-19 and 31 patients with critical COVID-19 were collected. The general characteristics and comorbidities of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. The initial and peak concentrations of serum troponin I (cTnI), D-dimer (D-D), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), initial and peak neutrophil counts and initial and trough lymphocyte counts were compared between two groups. The correlation between the variation of cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, neutrophils, lymphocytes and the severity of the disease was analyzed. The efficacy of the initial concentrations of cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, the initial neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in predicting critical COVID-19 were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results The initial and peak concentrations of cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, initial and peak neutrophil counts in critical group were higher than those in severe group, the initial and trough counts of lymphocyte were lower than those in the severe group. Except for the initial level of PCT, the other differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The increase of cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, neutrophils and the decrease of lymphocytes were related to the severity of the disease, OR values were 28.80, 2.20, 18.47, 10.80, 52.00, 9.60 and 21.08, respectively. Except for D-D, the other differences were statistically significant. The areas under ROC curves for predicting critical COVID-19 by initial concentrations of cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, initial lymphocyte and neutrophil counts were 0.76, 0.78, 0.83, 0.95, 0.56, 0.68 and 0.62, respectively. Conclusions The severe and critical COVID-19 patients had significant differences in concentrations of serum cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. The increase of cTnI, CRP, IL-6, PCT, neutrophils and decrease of lymphocytes indicated severe condition. The initial IL-6 might be a good indicator of COVID-19 severity.","Wang, Miao; Zhu, Qiguo; Fu, Jianguo; Liu, Lilong; Xiao, Mingzhe; Du, Yu",Infect Genet Evol,142,16

METHODS: An institutional multidisciplinary group of Head and Neck Surgical Oncology, Surgical Endocrinology, and Medical Endocrinology devised Surgical Triaging Guidelines for Endocrine Surgery during COVID-19, aligned with phases of care published by the ACS. RESULTS: Phases of care with examples of corresponding endocrine cases are outlined. Most cases can be safely postponed with active surveillance, including most differentiated and medullary thyroid cancers. During the most acute phase, all endocrine surgeries are deferred, except thyroid tumors requiring acute airway management.

Making a trade-off between economic recovery and infection control is a major challenge confronting many hard-hit counties. Understanding the transmission process and quantifying the costs of local policies are essential to the task of tackling this challenge. Here, we investigate the dynamic contact patterns of the populations from anonymized, geo-localized mobility data and census and demographic data to create data-driven, agent-based contact networks. We then simulate the epidemic spread with a time-varying contagion model in ten large metropolitan counties in the United States and evaluate a combination of mobility reduction, mask use, and reopening policies. We find that our model captures the spatial-temporal and heterogeneous case trajectory within various counties based on dynamic population behaviors. Our results show that a decision-making tool that considers both economic cost and infection outcomes of policies can be informative in making decisions of local containment strategies for optimal balancing of economic slowdown and virus spread.","Fan, Chao; Jiang, Xiangqi; Lee, Ronald; Mostafavi, Ali",,142,1

However, there is evidence that highly pathogenic HCoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), infect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and are shed in the fecal matter of the infected individuals. These observations have raised questions regarding the possibility of fecal-oral route as well as foodborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. Studies regarding the survival of HCoVs on inanimate surfaces demonstrate that these viruses can remain infectious for hours to days, however, there is limited data regarding the viral survival on fresh produce, which is usually consumed raw or with minimal heat processing. To address this knowledge gap, we examined the persistence of HCoV-229E, as a surrogate for highly pathogenic HCoVs, on the surface of commonly consumed fresh produce, including: apples, tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce. Herein, we demonstrated that viral infectivity declines within a few hours post-inoculation (p.i) on apples and tomatoes, and no infectious virus was detected at 24h p.i, while the virus persists in infectious form for 72h p.i on cucumbers and lettuce.

Despite adequate thromboprophylaxis, one-third of COVID-19 patients with pneumonia developed pulmonary embolism. This high rate of thrombotic complications has led to higher doses of anticoagulants according to clinical complexity (e.g. intensive care unit (ICU) patients) and D-dimer levels. On the other side of the coin, haemorrhagic complications are being increasingly reported. CASES PRESENTATION: We herein report four cases of spontaneous psoas haematomas (SPH) among 548 patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia between March 2020 and January 2021 (incidence of 7.3 cases per 1000 patients). All patients had pneumonia, with age ranging between 62 and 83 years. All patients received anticoagulant therapy with low weight molecular heparin (100 U.I. anti-Xa/kg 2 times/d) from admission: in two cases, a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was made. In another case, a thrombosis of left axillary and basilic veins was found, and only in one case anticoagulant therapy was started because of elevated levels of D-dimer. In all cases, signs of anaemia were detected and patients experienced low back or abdominal pain. The diagnosis of spontaneous psoas haematoma was made by computed tomography (CT) after a median of 12.5 d (9;16) from admission and 19.5 d (14.75; 24.25) from the beginning of COVID-19 symptoms. Half of these patients died from haemorrhagic shock. CONCLUSIONS: Given the potential life-threatening of SPH and the possible subtle clinical presentation, we believe it is crucial to raise clinicians awareness of this complication among COVID-19 patients undergoing anticoagulants.","Zerbato, Verena; Bozzato, Alessandro Marco; Di Bella, Stefano; Giuffrè, Mauro; Martingano, Paola; Di Giusto, Anna; Battisti, Sofia; Cova, Maria Assunta; Luzzati, Roberto; Cavallaro, Marco Francesco Maria",Infect Dis (Lond),142,30

Such behaviour can be caused by networks overfitting easy-to-learn, or statistically dominant, features while disregarding other potentially informative features. For example, indistinguishable differences in the sharpness of the images from two different scanners can degrade the performance of the network significantly. All neural networks intended for clinical practice need to be robust to variation in data caused by differences in imaging equipment, sample preparation and patient populations. To address these challenges, we evaluate the utility of spectral decoupling as an implicit bias mitigation method. Spectral decoupling encourages the neural network to learn more features by simply regularising the networks' unnormalised prediction scores with an L2 penalty, thus having no added computational costs. We show that spectral decoupling allows training neural networks on datasets with strong spurious correlations. Networks trained without spectral decoupling do not learn the original task and appear to make false predictions based on the spurious correlations. Spectral decoupling also increases networks' robustness for data distribution shifts. To validate our findings, we train networks with and without spectral decoupling to detect prostate cancer tissue slides and COVID-19 in chest radiographs. Networks trained with spectral decoupling achieve substantially higher performance on all evaluation datasets. Our results show that spectral decoupling helps with generalisation issues associated with neural networks. We recommend using spectral decoupling as an implicit bias mitigation method in any neural network intended for clinical use.","Pohjonen, Joona; Sturenberg, Carolin; Rannikko, Antti; Mirtti, Tuomas; Pitkanen, Esa",,142,22

Currently, aircraft cabins adopt mixing ventilation. However, complete mixing may not be achieved, and thus the particle concentration in the respiratory zone may vary from seat to seat in a cabin. To evaluate the particle exposure in a typical single-aisle aircraft cabin, this investigation constructed an aircraft cabin mockup for experimental tests. Particles were released from a single source or dual sources at different seats to represent particles exhaled by infected passengers. The particle concentrations in the respiratory zones at various seats were measured and compared. The particle exposure was evaluated in both a cross section and a longitudinal section. Leaving the middle seat vacant to reduce particle exposure was also addressed. In addition, the velocity fields and air temperatures were measured to provide a better understanding of particle transport. It was found that the particle exposure at the window seat is always the lowest, regardless of the particle release locations. If the passenger seated in the middle does not release particles, his/her presence enhances the particle dispersion and thereby reduces the particle exposure for adjacent passengers. In the cabin mockup, the released particles can be transported across at least four rows of seats in the longitudinal direction.","Li, Xingyang Zhang Tengfei Fan Mingqi Liu Mingxin Chang Di Wei Zhigang Lin Chao-Hsin Ji Shengcheng Liu Junjie Shen Shiong Long Zhengwei",Building and Environment,142,22

Frailty assessment is recommended by multiple COVID-19 guidelines to inform care and resource allocation. We aimed to identify, describe, and synthesize studies reporting the association of frailty with outcomes (informed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Triple Aim [health, resource use, and experience]) in individuals with COVID-19. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: Studies reporting associations between frailty and outcomes in the setting of COVID-19 diagnosis. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS: Following review of titles, abstracts and full text, we included 52 studies that contained 118,373 participants with COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic studies tool. Our primary outcome was mortality, secondary outcomes included delirium, intensive care unit admission, need for ventilation and discharge location. Where appropriate, random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool adjusted and unadjusted effect measures by frailty instrument. RESULTS: The Clinical Frailty Scale was the most used frailty instrument. Mortality was reported in 37 studies. After confounder adjustment, frailty identified using the CFS was significantly associated with mortality in COVID-19 positive patients (odds ratio 1.79, 95%CI 1.49 to 2.14; hazard ratio 1.87, 95%CI 1.33 to 2.61). On an unadjusted basis, frailty identified using the CFS was significantly associated with increased odds of delirium and reduced odds of intensive care unit admission. Results were generally consistent using other frailty instruments. Patient-reported, cost and experience outcomes were rarely reported. CONCLUSION: Frailty is associated with a substantial increase in mortality risk in COVID-19 patients, even after adjustment. Delirium risk is also increased. Frailty assessment may help to guide prognosis and individualized care planning, but data relating frailty status to patient-reported outcomes are urgently needed to provide a more comprehensive overview of outcomes relevant to older adults.

This paper explores how this twofold burden affected leisure time sports and exercise (LTSE). Following a gender inequality perspective, it is assumed that the level of LTSE of working mothers are more negatively affected by the pandemic than LTSE levels of working fathers. Using the nation-wide representative SPOVID survey, the paper analyses data of all respondents in fulltime employment ( N = 631). Data collection took place in October and November 2020 in collaboration with Forsa, a leading corporation for public opinion polls in Germany. Results show that the pandemic led to a reduction of LTSE levels, but with considerable variation between working mothers and fathers. Fulltime working mothers reduced their LTSE by a substantial margin (54 min per week), but not working fathers. It is concluded that the double burden of work demands and childcare duties in the pandemic was largely shouldered by mothers, who then faced greater difficulties to remain active.","Mutz, Michael Reimers Anne K.",German Journal of Exercise and Sport Research,142,22

To meet that need, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), the nation's largest hospital surveillance system, launched a module for collecting hospital coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) data. We present time-series estimates of the critical hospital capacity indicators from April 1 to July 14, 2020. DESIGN: From March 27 to July 14, 2020, the NHSN collected daily data on hospital bed occupancy, number of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and the availability and/or use of mechanical ventilators. Time series were constructed using multiple imputation and survey weighting to allow near-real-time daily national and state estimates to be computed. RESULTS: During the pandemic's April peak in the United States, among an estimated 431,000 total inpatients, 84,000 (19%) had COVID-19. Although the number of inpatients with COVID-19 decreased from April to July, the proportion of occupied inpatient beds increased steadily. COVID-19 hospitalizations increased from mid-June in the South and Southwest regions after stay-at-home restrictions were eased. The proportion of inpatients with COVID-19 on ventilators decreased from April to July. CONCLUSIONS: The NHSN hospital capacity estimates served as important, near-real-time indicators of the pandemic's magnitude, spread, and impact, providing quantitative guidance for the public health response. Use of the estimates detected the rise of hospitalizations in specific geographic regions in June after they declined from a peak in April. Patient outcomes appeared to improve from early April to mid-July.","Sapiano, Mathew R P; Dudeck, Margaret A; Soe, Minn; Edwards, Jonathan R; O039,; Leary, Erin N; Wu, Hsiu; Allen-Bridson, Katherine; Amor, Agasha; Arcement, Rashad; Chernetsky Tejedor, Sheri; Dantes, Ray; Gross, Cindy; Haass, Kathryn; Konnor, Rebecca; Kroop, Seth R; Leaptrot, Denise; Lemoine, Kent; Nkwata, Allan; Peterson, Kelly; Wattenmaker, Lauren; Weiner-Lastinger, Lindsey M; Pollock, Daniel; Benin, Andrea L",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,142,21

An attempt to reduce infection and spread of the disease, for most nations, has led to a lockdown period, where people's movement has been restricted resulting in a consequential impact on employment, lifestyle behaviours and wellbeing. As such, this study aimed to explore adults' thoughts and behaviours in response to the outbreak and resulting lockdown measures. METHODS: Using an online survey, 1126 adults responded to invitations to participate in the study. Participants, all aged 18 years or older, were recruited using social media, email distribution lists, website advertisement and word of mouth. Sentiment and personality features extracted from free-text responses using Artificial Intelligence methods were used to cluster participants. RESULTS: Findings demonstrated that there was varied knowledge of the symptoms of COVID-19 and high concern about infection, severe illness and death, spread to others, the impact on the health service and on the economy. Higher concerns about infection, illness and death were reported by people identified at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Behavioural clusters, identified using Artificial Intelligence methods, differed significantly in sentiment and personality traits, as well as concerns about COVID-19, actions, lifestyle behaviours and wellbeing during the COVID-19 lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: This time-sensitive study provides important insights into adults' perceptions and behaviours in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown. The use of Artificial Intelligence has identified that there are two behavioural clusters that can predict people's responses during the COVID-19 pandemic, which goes beyond simple demographic groupings. Considering these insights may improve the effectiveness of communication, actions to reduce the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to support community recovery.","Flint, S W; Piotrkowicz, A; Watts, K",Perspect Public Health,142,20

We used a phylodynamics approach to better understand this sub-epidemic by analyzing 270 HIV-1 polymerase (pol) sequences collected from persons diagnosed with HIV/AIDS between 1995 and 2019. Using network analyses at a 1.5% genetic distance threshold (d), we found a large 154-member outbreak cluster composed mostly of persons who inject drugs (PWID) that were predominantly men. At d = 0.5%, which was used to identify more recent transmission, the large cluster dissociated into three clusters of 18, 12, and 7 members, respectively, five dyads, and 107 singletons. Phylogenetic analysis of the Bulgarian sequences with publicly available global sequences showed that CRF01_AE likely originated from multiple Asian countries, with Vietnam as the likely source of the outbreak cluster between 1988 and 1990. Our findings indicate that CRF01_AE was introduced into Bulgaria multiple times since 1988, and infections then rapidly spread among PWID locally with bridging to other risk groups and countries. CRF01_AE continues to spread in Bulgaria as evidenced by the more recent large clusters identified at d = 0.5%, highlighting the importance of public health prevention efforts in the PWID communities.","Alexiev, Ivailo; Campbell, Ellsworth M; Knyazev, Sergey; Pan, Yi; Grigorova, Lyubomira; Dimitrova, Reneta; Partsuneva, Aleksandra; Gancheva, Anna; Kostadinova, Asya; Seguin-Devaux, Carole; Elenkov, Ivaylo; Yancheva, Nina; Switzer, William M",Viruses,142,1

However, there is a lack of evidence specific to the low/lower-middle-income country (L-LMIC) health systems on how IHSD is used during disease outbreaks. This scoping review aimed to synthesise the emerging evidence on IHSD approaches adopted in L-LMIC during the COVID-19 pandemic and systematically collate their operational features. METHODS: A systematic scoping review of peer-reviewed literature, published in English between 1 December 2019 and 12 June 2020, from seven electronic databases was conducted to explore the evidence of IHSD implemented in L-LMICs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were systematically charted, and key features of IHSD systems were presented according to the postulated research questions of the review. RESULTS: The literature search retrieved 1487 published articles from which 18 articles met the inclusion criteria and included in this review. Service delivery, health workforce, medicine and technologies were the three most frequently integrated health system building blocks during the COVID-19 pandemic. While responding to COVID-19, the L-LMICs principally implemented the IHSD system via systematic horizontal integration, led by specific policy measures. The government's stewardship, along with the decentralised decision-making capacity of local institutions and multisectoral collaboration, was the critical facilitator for IHSD. Simultaneously, fragmented service delivery structures, fragile supply chain, inadequate diagnostic capacity and insufficient workforce were key barriers towards integration. CONCLUSION: A wide array of context-specific IHSD approaches were operationalised in L-LMICs during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging recommendations emphasise the importance of coordination and integration across building blocks and levels of the health system, supported by a responsive governance structure and stakeholder engagement strategies. Future reviews can revisit this emerging evidence base at subsequent phases of COVID-19 response and recovery in L-LMICs to understand how the approaches highlighted here evolve.","Hasan, Md Zabir; Neill, Rachel; Das, Priyanka; Venugopal, Vasuki; Arora, Dinesh; Bishai, David; Jain, Nishant; Gupta, Shivam",,142,24

However, for vaccination efforts to succeed, there must be widespread willingness to vaccinate. Prior research has found that Black Americans, who are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, report lower intentions to get a vaccine than do other populations. We investigate two potential contributors to this disparity: COVID-19 vaccine-related behavioral beliefs and trust in four COVID-19 information sources (mainstream media, social media, President Trump, and public health officials and agencies). Using a nationally-representative survey (n= 889), we demonstrate that differences in vaccination beliefs explain the lower vaccination intentions reported by Black participants, compared to non-Black participants. However, while trust in information sources is associated with vaccination beliefs, differences in trust do not account for the observed differences in vaccination beliefs by race. Furthermore, we find that race moderates the relationships between trust in two sources (Trump and public health officials and agencies) and vaccination beliefs. The effects of trusting these sources on COVID-19 vaccine-related beliefs are smaller among Black participants; thus trust in these sources is less consequential to their pro-vaccination beliefs. Our results suggest that trust in information sources alone does not explain the observed relationship between race and vaccination beliefs.","Woko, Chioma; Siegel, Leeann; Hornik, Robert",J Health Commun,142,16

In total, 23% (231/1,005) of the employees tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and 14.3% (144/1,005) were found positive for IgM (either alone or combined with IgG), indicating recent or present infection. Of those that tested seropositive, 46.5% did not report any clinical symptoms, indicating pre- or asymptomatic infections. Reported symptoms with the highest correlation with seropositivity were fever and loss of smell and taste. These results suggest that antibody testing of employees in elderly care homes is valuable for surveillance of disease development and a crucial screening tool in the effort to decrease the death toll in this pandemic.","Lindahl, Johanna F.; Hoffman, Tove; Esmaeilzadeh, Mouna; Olsen, Björn; Winter, Reidar; Amer, Stefan; Molnár, Christian; Svalberg, Ann; Lundkvist, Åke",Infect.

Analyzing the available literature, there is very scarce evidence regarding the use of MIS and robotics for treatment of pediatric surgical and urological pathologies during this pandemic. However, we found some useful information that we would like to share with other pediatric surgeons and urologists through this journal. Based upon the available data, we believe that surgery should only be performed in pediatric patients with emergent/urgent and oncological indications until resolution of the COVID-19 outbreak. Robotics and MIS may be safely performed in such selected children by adopting specific technical precautions such as prevention of aerosol dispersion using filters/suction or adapted systems and appropriate use of electrocautery and other sealing devices for reduction of surgical smoke, as reported in our recent experience. Another key point to manage this pandemic emergency is that all hospitals should provide health care professionals with adequate individual protections and perform universal screening in all patients undergoing surgery. Considering that this pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation with new information available daily, these data resulting from the analysis of literature focused on pediatric robotics and MIS may be further revised and updated.","Esposito, Ciro; Masieri, Lorenzo; Castagnetti, Marco; Crocetto, Felice; Escolino, Maria",J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech A,142,27

Here, we present a theory that fully specifies, without any adjustable parameters, the optimal design of a canonical sensing system, in terms of two elementary design principles: (1) there exists an optimal integration time, which is determined by the input statistics and the number of receptors; (2) in the optimally designed system, the number of independent concentration measurements as set by the number of receptors and the optimal integration time, equals the number of readout molecules that store these measurements, and equals the work to store these measurements reliably; no resource is then in excess and hence wasted. Applying our theory to the E.coli chemotaxis system indicates that its integration time is not only optimal for sensing shallow gradients, but also necessary to enable navigation in these gradients.","Malaguti, Giulia; Ten Wolde, Pieter Rein",eLife (Cambridge),142,1

For this purpose, this study was conducted to develop sensitive artificial intelligence (AI) models to assist radiologists to decisively differentiate pneumonia due to COVID-19 versus influenza viruses. Methods: Cross sectional chest CT images (N=12744) from well-evaluated cases of pneumonias induced by COVID-19 or H1N1 Influenza viruses, and normal individuals were collected. We examined the computer tomographic (CT) chest images from 137 individuals. Various pre-trained convolutional neural network models, such as ResNet-50, InceptionV3, Wide ResNet, SqueezNet, VGG 16 and VGG 19 were fine-tuned on our datasets. The datasets were used for training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%) of the final models. Also, the predictive power and means of precision and recall were determined for each model. Results: Fine-tuned ResNet-50 model differentiated the pneumonia due to COVID-19 or H1N1 influenza virus with accuracies of 96.7% and 92%, respectively This model outperformed all others, i.e., InceptionV3, Wide ResNet, SqueezNet, VGG 16 and VGG 19. Conclusion: Fine-tuned and pre-trained image classifying models of AI enable radiologists to reliably differentiate the pneumonia induced by COVID-19 versus H1N1 influenza virus. For this purpose, ResNet-50 followed by InceptionV3 models proved more promising than other AI models. Also in the supplements, we share the source codes and our fine-tuned models for use by researchers and clinicians globally toward the critical task of image differentiation of patients infected with COVID-19 versus H1N1 Influenza viruses.","Sotoudeh, Houman; Tabatabaei, Mohsen; Tasorian, Baharak; Tavakol, Kamran; Sotoudeh, Ehsan; Moini, Abdol Latif",Acta Inform Med,142,10

While decreasing transmission is an important goal, it is not the only goal that quality healthcare must aim to achieve. Severely restricted visitation policies undermine our ability to provide humane, family-centered care, particularly during critical illness and at the end of life. The enforcement of these policies consequently increases the risk of moral distress and injury for providers. Using our experience in a PICU, we survey the shortcomings of current visitation restrictions. We argue that hospital visitation restrictions can be implemented in ways that are nonmaleficent, but this requires unwavering acknowledgment of the value of social and familial support during illness and death. We advocate that visitation restriction policies be implemented by independent, medically knowledgeable decision-making bodies, with the informed participation of patients and their families.","Andrist, Erica; Clarke, Rachel G; Harding, Meghan",Pediatr Crit Care Med,142,6

The analysis focuses on the social actions the participants are seen to be carrying out and orienting to through talk such confessions and disclosures of minor unlawful behaviour in public. A set of features of confessions were found depending on whether personal circumstances could be said to warrant the breaches and the recipients align or not with the warrantability of the breaches. Callers who disclosed their breaches at the first available opportunity, presented them as primarily warranted by a long-term health condition and displayed full awareness of doing confessing. Both early confessions and those that appear later in the narration were carefully crafted. They were mitigated to minimize the seriousness of the transgression and reduce the actor’s accountability. The positional nuances of the participants as they share their stories, coupled with their assessment of self- and other behaviour, shines a light on their orientations to, and interactional management of, the moral accountability of behaviour in public spaces during the pandemic.","Reiter, Rosina Márquez",Journal of Pragmatics,142,16

This study will also provide an important opportunity to investigate the safety and tolerability of favipiravir, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of this drug and mechanisms of resistance in the context of COVID-19 infection, as well as the effect of favipiravir on hospitalisation duration and the post COVID-19 health and psycho-social wellbeing of patients recruited to the study. TRIAL DESIGN: GETAFIX is an open label, parallel group, two arm phase II/III randomised trial with 1:1 treatment allocation ratio. Patients will be randomised to one of two arms and the primary endpoint will assess the superiority of favipiravir plus standard treatment compared to standard treatment alone. PARTICIPANTS: This trial will recruit adult patients with confirmed positive valid COVID-19 test, who are not pregnant or breastfeeding and have no prior major co-morbidities. This is a multi-centre trial, patients will be recruited from in-patients and outpatients from three Glasgow hospitals: Royal Alexandra Hospital; Queen Elizabeth University Hospital; and the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Patients must meet all of the following criteria: 1. Age 16 or over at time of consent 2. Exhibiting symptoms associated with COVID-19 3. Positive for SARS-CoV-2 on valid COVID-19 test 4.

Unable to discontinue contra-indicated concomitant medications This is a multi-centre trial, patients will be recruited from in-patients and outpatients from three Glasgow hospitals: Royal Alexandra Hospital; Queen Elizabeth University Hospital; and the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients randomised to the experimental arm of GETAFIX will receive standard treatment for COVID-19 at the discretion of the treating clinician plus favipiravir. These patients will receive a loading dose of favipiravir on day 1 of 3600mg (1800mg 12 hours apart). On days 2-10, patients in the experimental arm will receive a maintenance dose of favipiravir of 800mg 12 hours apart (total of 18 doses). Patients randomised to the control arm of the GETAFIX trial will receive standard treatment for COVID-19 at the discretion of the treating clinician. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome being assessed in the GETAFIX trial is the efficacy of favipiravir in addition to standard treatment in patients with COVID-19 in reducing the severity of disease compared to standard treatment alone. Disease severity will be assessed using WHO COVID 10 point ordinal severity scale at day 15 +/- 48 hours. All randomised participants will be followed up until death or 60 days post-randomisation (whichever is sooner). RANDOMISATION: Patients will be randomised 1:1 to the experimental versus control arm using computer generated random sequence allocation.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a routinely measured biomarker, and reduction in its levels after initiation of therapy may predict inpatient mortality. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, the charts of patients who were admitted to Montefiore Medical Center between March 10, 2020, and May 2, 2020 for the management of COVID-19 were examined. Of all patients who met inclusion criteria, patients who received corticosteroid treatment were categorized as CRP responders (&#8805;50% CRP level reduction) and CRP nonresponders (<50% CRP level reduction) based on change in CRP within 72 hours of corticosteroid treatment initiation. The outcomes of interest were two-fold: (1) CRP response after treatment with corticosteroid, and (2) differences in mortality among patients with CRP response compared those without. RESULTS: Of 2,707 patients admitted during the study period, 324 received corticosteroid treatment. Of patients who received corticosteroid treatment, CRP responders had reduced risk of death compared with risk among CRP nonresponders (25.2% vs 47.8%; unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.21-0.65; P <.001). This effect remained strong and significant after adjustment for potential confounders (adjusted OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14-0.54; P <.001). CONCLUSION: Reduction in CRP by 50% or more within 72 hours of initiating corticosteroid therapy potentially predicts inpatient mortality. This may serve as an early biomarker of response to corticosteroid therapy in patients with COVID-19.","Cui, Zhu; Merritt, Zachary; Assa, Andrei; Mustehsan, Hashim; Chung, Erica; Liu, Sichen; Kumthekar, Anand; Ayesha, Bibi; McCort, Margaret; Palaiodimos, Leonidas; Baron, Sarah; Averbukh, Yelena; Southern, William; Arora, Shitij",J Hosp Med,142,1

However, AKI among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the United States is not well described. METHODS: This retrospective, observational study involved a review of data from electronic health records of patients aged &#8805;18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Mount Sinai Health System from February 27 to May 30, 2020. We describe the frequency of AKI and dialysis requirement, AKI recovery, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with mortality. RESULTS: Of 3993 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, AKI occurred in 1835 (46%) patients; 347 (19%) of the patients with AKI required dialysis. The proportions with stages 1, 2, or 3 AKI were 39%, 19%, and 42%, respectively. A total of 976 (24%) patients were admitted to intensive care, and 745 (76%) experienced AKI. Of the 435 patients with AKI and urine studies, 84% had proteinuria, 81% had hematuria, and 60% had leukocyturia. Independent predictors of severe AKI were CKD, men, and higher serum potassium at admission. In-hospital mortality was 50% among patients with AKI versus 8% among those without AKI (aOR, 9.2; 95% confidence interval, 7.5 to 11.3). Of survivors with AKI who were discharged, 35% had not recovered to baseline kidney function by the time of discharge. An additional 28 of 77 (36%) patients who had not recovered kidney function at discharge did so on posthospital follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: AKI is common among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and is associated with high mortality. Of all patients with AKI, only 30% survived with recovery of kidney function by the time of discharge.","Chan, Lili; Chaudhary, Kumardeep; Saha, Aparna; Chauhan, Kinsuk; Vaid, Akhil; Zhao, Shan; Paranjpe, Ishan; Somani, Sulaiman; Richter, Felix; Miotto, Riccardo; Lala, Anuradha; Kia, Arash; Timsina, Prem; Li, Li; Freeman, Robert; Chen, Rong; Narula, Jagat; Just, Allan C; Horowitz, Carol; Fayad, Zahi; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Schadt, Eric; Levin, Matthew A; Reich, David L; Fuster, Valentin; Murphy, Barbara; He, John C; Charney, Alexander W; Böttinger, Erwin P; Glicksberg, Benjamin S; Coca, Steven G; Nadkarni, Girish N",J.

Although public health experts predicted worst outcomes in Africa, the incidence, hospitalization and mortality rates have been lower in Africa compared to other continents. Interestingly, lower incidence and mortality rates have been observed in women from Africa compared to their cohorts from other continents. Also, in the US non-Hispanic Black females have lower COVID-19 and death rates compared to their white counterparts. It's unclear why this significant difference exists; however, the ovarian function, genetics and immunological statuses could play a major role. Women of African descent have elevated levels of estrogen compared with Caucasians hence we anticipate that estrogen might offer some protection against the SARS-CoV-2 infections. The racial differences in lifestyle, age and inaccessibility to contraceptive usage might also play a role. Here, we provide insight on how the high levels of estrogen in African women might contribute to the lower cases and fatalities in Africa. Specifically, estrogen might offer protection against COVID-19 by suppressing hyper-production of cytokines, promoting anti-inflammatory cytokines, stimulating antibody production and suppressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This will as well provide useful information on how future pandemics could be managed using Africa as a case study.","Dufailu, Osman A; Afriyie-Asante, Afrakoma; Gyan, Bernard; Kwabena, David Adu; Yeboah, Helena; Ntiakoh, Frank; Asare-Werehene, Meshach",J Ovarian Res,142,1

METHODS: A total of 27 pediatric patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection hospitalized from March 16 to April 15, 2020, at the Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital were enrolled in the study. At admission, all patients showed ocular manifestations. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs were performed every 2-3 days before discharge. RESULTS: Of the 27 patients, 4 (15%) were asymptomatic, 15 (56%) showed respiratory symptoms, and 8 (30%) had gastrointestinal symptoms. At admission, nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for COVID-19 in all patients; on the second swabs, 7 children (26%) tested negative, and 20 remained positive for COVID-19. Ocular manifestations consistent with mild viral conjunctivitis were observed in 4 patients (15%). At first conjunctival swab, 3 patients (11%), 1 symptomatic and 2 asymptomatic for ocular infection, had positive findings for COVID-19; 2 became negative on the second test and 1 on the third. CONCLUSIONS: In our study cohort, ocular manifestations of COVID-19 seem to have had a milder clinical course in pediatric patients than in adults. Despite the low prevalence and rapid regression of viral presence in the conjunctiva, SARS-CoV-2 transmission through tears may be possible, even in patients without apparent ocular involvement.","Valente, Paola; Iarossi, Giancarlo; Federici, Matteo; Petroni, Sergio; Palma, Paolo; Cotugno, Nicola; De Ioris, Maria A; Campana, Andrea; Buzzonetti, Luca",J AAPOS,142,26

Many field experiments have observed large sensitivity of leaf C:N ratio to eCO2 and iNDEP. However, the large-scale pattern of this sensitivity is still unclear, because eCO2 and iNDEP drive leaf C:N ratio toward opposite directions, which are further compounded by the complex processes of nitrogen acquisition and plant-and-microbial nitrogen competition. Here, we attempt to map the leaf C:N ratio spatial variation in the past 5 decades in China with a combination of data-driven model and process-based modeling. These two approaches showed consistent results. Over different regions, we found that leaf C:N ratio had significant but uneven changes between 2 time periods (1960-1989 and 1990-2015): a 5% ± 8% increase for temperate grasslands in northern China, a 3% ± 6% increase for boreal grasslands in western China, and by contrast, a 7% ± 6% decrease for temperate forests in southern China, and a 3% ± 5% decrease for boreal forests in northeastern China. Additionally, the structural equation models indicated that the leaf C:N change was sensitive to &#916;NDEP, &#916;CO2 and &#916;MAT rather than &#916;MAP and ecosystem types. Process-based modeling suggested that iNDEP was the main source of soil mineral nitrogen change, dominating leaf C:N ratio change in most areas in China, while eCO2 led to leaf C:N ratio increase in low iNDEP area. This study also indicates that the long-term leaf C:N ratio acclimation was dominated by climate constraint, especially temperature, but was constrained by soil N availability over decade scale.","Sheng, Mingyang; Tang, Jinyun; Yang, Dawen; Fisher, Joshua B; Wang, Han; Kattge, Jens",Sci Total Environ,142,26

Therefore, the identification of lipids and metabolic pathways that are suitable targets for antiviral development is crucial. Using a library of compounds targeting host lipid metabolic factors and testing them for their ability to block pseudorabies virus (PRV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, we found that U18666A, a specific inhibitor of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), is highly potent in suppressing the entry of diverse viruses including pseudotyped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). NPC1 deficiency markedly attenuates viral growth by decreasing cholesterol abundance in the plasma membrane, thereby inhibiting the dynamics of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), which are indispensable for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Significantly, exogenous cholesterol can complement the dynamics of CCPs, leading to efficient viral entry and infectivity. Administration of U18666A improves the survival and pathology of PRV- and influenza A virus-infected mice. Thus, our studies demonstrate a unique mechanism by which NPC1 inhibition achieves broad antiviral activity, indicating a potential new therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2, as well as other emerging viruses.","Li, Guoli; Su, Bingqian; Fu, Pengfei; Bai, Yilin; Ding, Guangxu; Li, Dahua; Wang, Jiang; Yang, Guoyu; Chu, Beibei","Sci.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure serum pNfH concentration in 219 MND patients consecutively enrolled in our tertiary MND clinic. A multifactorial analysis was carried out to investigate the major clinical determinants of serum pNfH. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression analysis were performed to explore the prognostic value of serum pNfH. Serum pNfH levels were not homogenous among MND phenotypes; higher concentrations in pyramidal, bulbar, and classic phenotypes were observed. C9orf72-MND exhibited higher pNfH concentrations compared to non-C9orf72 MND. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed mean MEP/cMAP and disease progression rate as the two major predictors of serum pNfH levels (R2 = 0.188; p &#8804; 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significant difference of survival among MND subgroups when divided into quartiles based on pNfH concentrations, log-rank X2 = 53.0, p &#8804; 0.0001. Our study evidenced that higher serum pNfH concentration is a negative independent prognostic factor for survival. In Cox multivariate model, pNfH concentration showed the highest hazard ratio compared to the other factors influencing survival included in the analysis. pNfH differs among the MND phenotypes and is an independent prognostic factor for survival. This study provides supporting evidence of the role of pNfH as useful prognostic biomarker for MND patients. Neurofilament measurements should be considered in the future prognostic models and in clinical trials for biomarker-based stratification, and to evaluate treatment response.","Falzone, Yuri Matteo; Domi, Teuta; Agosta, Federica; Pozzi, Laura; Schito, Paride; Fazio, Raffaella; Del Carro, Ubaldo; Barbieri, Alessandra; Comola, Mauro; Leocani, Letizia; Comi, Giancarlo; Carrera, Paola; Filippi, Massimo; Quattrini, Angelo; Riva, Nilo",J Neurol,142,26

A growing body of research has highlighted several comorbidities and presenting factors in which delay or permanent deferral of surgery may be considered;however, modern comprehensive summative reviews are lacking. The urgency and timing of this review are underscored by significant challenges in resource use posed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This review provides an update on the current understanding of risk assessment, surgical candidacy, and operative timing in patients with ATAAD. METHODS: A literature search was conducted through PubMed and Embase databases to identify relevant studies relating to risk assessment in ATAAD. Articles were selected by group consensus on the basis of quality and relevance. RESULTS: Several patient factors have been identified that increase risk in ATAAD repair. In particular, frailty, advanced age, previous cardiac surgery, and use of novel anticoagulant medications have been studied. The understanding of malperfusion syndromes has also expanded significantly, including recommendations for surgical delay. Finally, approaches to triage have been significantly influenced by resource limitations related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although medical management remains a reasonable option in carefully selected patients at prohibitive risk for open surgery, endovascular therapies for treatment of ATAAD are rapidly evolving. CONCLUSIONS: Early surgical repair remains the preferred treatment for most patients with ATAAD. However, improvements in risk stratification should guide appropriate delay or permanent deferral of surgery in select individuals.","Sabe, A. A.; Percy, E. D.; Kaneko, T.; Plichta, R. P.; Hughes, G.

The clinicians are conflicted regarding the usage of these medications. Appropriate dose and duration of therapy are unknown. Here, we will discuss the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of CQ and HCQ, as well as review the antiviral properties. The manuscript will also examine the available data from recent clinical and preclinical trials in order to shed light on the apparent inconsistencies.","Saha, Biplab K; Bonnier, Alyssa; Chong, Woon",Am. j. med. sci,142,20

Prior research has shown little party divide on voting by mail, with nearly equal percentages of voters in both parties choosing to vote this way where it is an option. Has a divide opened up this year in how voters aligned with the Democratic and Republican parties prefer to cast a ballot? We address these questions with two nationally diverse, online surveys fielded from April 8 to 10 and June 11 to 13, of 5,612 and 5,818 eligible voters, respectively, with an embedded experiment providing treated respondents with scientific projections about the COVID-19 outbreak. We find a nearly 10 percentage point difference between Democrats and Republicans in their preference for voting by mail in April, which had doubled in size to nearly 20 percentage points in June. This partisan gap is wider still for those exposed to scientific projections about the pandemic. We also find that support for national legislation requiring states to offer no-excuse absentee ballots has emerged as an increasingly polarized issue.","Lockhart, Mackenzie; Hill, Seth J; Merolla, Jennifer; Romero, Mindy; Kousser, Thad",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,142,1

Dietary supplements (DSs) and herbal medicine provide a potentially convenient and accessible method for its recovery, but direct evidence is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of DSs and herbs in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in multiple electronic English and Chinese databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving DSs or herbal medicine interventions on patients with COVID-19 from November 2019 to February 2021 were included. Data was extracted, summarized and critically examined. RESULTS: Out of 9402 records identified in the initial search, twelve RCTs were included in this review. Risk of bias of these RCTs was deemed high. Most of the trials were of low methodologic quality. Nine studies showed herbal supplements were beneficial to the recovery of COVID-19 patients; zinc sulfate could shorten the duration of loss of smell but not total recovery from COVID-19. No severe adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Herbal supplements may help patients with COVID-19, zinc sulfate is likely to shorten the duration of olfactory dysfunction. DS therapy and herbal medicine appear to be safe and effective adjuvant therapies for patients with COVID-19. These results must be interpreted with caution due to the overall low quality of the included trials. More well-designed RCTs are needed in the future.","Feng, Zitong; Yang, Juan; Xu, Mingzhu; Lin, Run; Yang, Huijun; Lai, Liting; Wang, Yixiao; Wahner-Roedler, Dietlind L; Zhou, Xuan; Shin, Kyung-Min; Salinas, Manisha; Mallory, Molly J; Tang, Chunzhi; Patchett, David C; Bauer, Brent A; Cui, Shaoyang",Clin Nutr ESPEN,142,16

METHODS: In this retrospective IRB-approved study, we identified COVID-19 patients who had a standard-of-care contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan within 5 days of their COVID-19 diagnosis at our institution (training set; n = 45, mean age 65 years, M/F 23/22) and at a second institution (validation set; n = 41, mean age 61 years, M/F 22/19). The CT renal perfusion parameter, cortex-to-aorta enhancement index (CAEI), was measured in both sets. A multivariate logistic regression model for predicting AKI was constructed from the training set with stepwise feature selection with CAEI together with demographical and baseline laboratory/clinical data used as input variables. Model performance in the training and validation set was evaluated with ROC analysis. RESULTS: AKI developed in 16 patients (35.6%) of the training set and in 6 patients (14.6%) of the validation set. Baseline CAEI was significantly lower in the patients that ultimately developed AKI (P = 0.003). Logistic regression identified a model combining baseline CAEI, blood urea nitrogen, and gender as most significant predictor of AKI. This model showed excellent diagnostic performance for prediction of AKI in the training set (AUC = 0.89, P < 0.001) and good performance in the validation set (AUC 0.78, P = 0.030). CONCLUSION: Our results show diminished renal perfusion preceding AKI and a promising role of CAEI, combined with laboratory and demographic markers, for prediction of AKI in COVID-19.","Hectors, Stefanie J; Riyahi, Sadjad; Dev, Hreedi; Krishnan, Karthik; Margolis, Daniel J A; Prince, Martin R",Abdom. radiology (Internet),142,26

This pattern was mirrored in scRNA-seq signatures of NK cells in bronchoalveolar lavage from COVID-19 patients. Unsupervised high-dimensional analysis of peripheral blood NK cells furthermore identified distinct NK cell immunotypes that were linked to disease severity. Hallmarks of these immunotypes were high expression of perforin, NKG2C, and Ksp37, reflecting increased presence of adaptive NK cells in circulation of patients with severe disease. Finally, arming of CD56bright NK cells was observed across COVID-19 disease states, driven by a defined protein-protein interaction network of inflammatory soluble factors.

This pilot trial tested the acceptability and feasibility of a multimodal, mind-body resiliency intervention targeting FOR among survivors of various cancers. METHODS: Early stage cancer survivors 330 months post-treatment were recruited to participate in an eight-session in-person mind-body resiliency group intervention that taught relaxation skills, cognitive-behavioral techniques, healthy lifestyle behaviors, mindfulness meditation, and positive psychology skills all targeted for FOR. Primary outcomes were feasibility (enrollment rate, session attendance, survey completion, skills practice) and acceptability (enjoyableness, convenience, helpfulness, relevance). Patient-reported outcomes (FOR, uncertainty intolerance, cancer-related uncertainty, perceived stress, resiliency, positive affect, and coping skills) were collected at baseline, post-intervention, +1 month, and +3 months. Exit interviews assessed survivors' reported benefits. RESULTS: Participants (N = 4 groups, 23 survivors, enrollment response rate = 58%) included survivors of seven common cancer types who were on average 12 months post-treatment. Attendance was high (M = 6.1 sessions), and 96% of survivors completed all surveys. Sustained increases in relaxation skills practice 3+ days/week were reported (baseline = 16%, post-intervention = 76%, +3 months = 71%). Most sessions (87%) were rated as highly or very highly acceptable. Moderate-to-large (d = 0.87) improvements in FOR severity were observed post-intervention (p < .01) and across assessments (p < .01), with similar changes observed in other patient-reported outcomes. Exit interviews revealed behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and existential benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The targeted mind-body resiliency intervention shows promising acceptability, feasibility, and favorable changes in FOR and coping skills practice.

This implies that MSCs that have limited or low capacity to secrete BALs may be unable to bring about their beneficial actions. This proposal implies that pretreatment of MSCs with BALs enhance their physiological action or improve their (MSCs) anti-inflammatory and disease resolution capacity to a significant degree. Thus, the beneficial action of MSCs reported in the management of COVID-19 could be attributed to their ability to secrete BALs, especially PGE2 and LXA4. Since PGE2, LXA4 and their precursors AA (arachidonic acid), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory IL-6 and TNF-&#945;, they could be employed to treat cytokine storm seen in COVID-19, immune check point inhibitory (ICI) therapy, sepsis and ARDS (acute respiratory disease). This is further supported by the observation that GLA, DGLA and AA inactivate enveloped viruses including COVID-19. Thus, infusions of appropriate amounts of GLA, DGLA, AA, PGE2 and LXA4 are of significant therapeutic benefit in COVID-19, ICI therapy and other inflammatory conditions including but not limited to sepsis. AA is the precursor of both PGE2 and LXA4 suggesting that AA is most suited for such preventive and therapeutic approach.","Das, Undurti N",Aging Dis,142,11

We employed resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), in conjunction with graph-theoretical analysis and a newly developed functional ""disruption index,"" to study whole-brain as well as local functional changes in patients with unilateral SSNHL. We also assessed the potential of graph-theoretical measures as biomarkers of disease, in terms of their relationship to clinically relevant audiological parameters. Eight patients with moderate or severe unilateral SSNHL and 15 healthy controls were included in this prospective pilot study. All patients underwent rs-fMRI to study potential changes in brain connectivity. From rs-fMRI data, global and local graph-theoretical measures, disruption index, and audiological examinations were estimated. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to study the differences between SSNHL patients and healthy controls. Associations between brain metrics and clinical variables were studied using multiple linear regressions, and the presence or absence of brain network hubs was assessed using Fisher's exact test. No statistically significant differences between SSNHL patients and healthy controls were found in global or local network measures. However, when analyzing brain networks through the disruption index, we found a brain-wide functional network reorganization (p < 0.001 as compared with controls), whose extent was associated with clinical impairment (p < 0.05). We also observed several functional hubs in SSNHL patients that were not present in healthy controls and vice versa. Our results demonstrate a brain involvement in SSNHL patients, not detectable using conventional graph-theoretical analysis, which may yield subtle disease clues and possibly aid in monitoring disease progression in clinical trials.","Minosse, Silvia; Garaci, Francesco; Martino, Federica; Di Mauro, Roberta; Melis, Milena; Di Giuliano, Francesca; Picchi, Eliseo; Guerrisi, Maria; Floris, Roberto; Di Girolamo, Stefano; Toschi, Nicola",NMR Biomed,142,20

The present paper is a comment on E. Gibney's article 'Whose coronavirus strategy worked best?' (Nature 2020;581:15-6). The strategy for phase 2 should be more complex and interdisciplinary than described in the paper in Nature, especially in the period before a vaccine and specific treatments are available. The focus on reducing the mortality of COVID-19 will have side effects, including excess mortality from other causes. A part of this excess mortality will be based on the reduction of health-care offers as a consequence of the pandemic, and on structural limitations of the health-care system. A special challenge is to understand the relationship between death from and death with COVID-19, and therefore the relevance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in people with pre-existing burdens, for example coronary heart disease, cancer or older age. There is a need to extend the recently used tools to all available instruments, including physiological principles of prevention and promotion. The way to integrate global solidarity into the strategies of the different countries is critical not only for global health but also for the peace and long-term success for each individual country.

In this study we attempted to estimate the number of TB patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have severe disease during the COVID-19 epidemic in Delhi, India. METHODS: Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model was used to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases in Delhi. Assuming the prevalence of TB in Delhi to be 0.55%, 53% of SARS-CoV2 infected TB cases to present with severe disease we estimated the number of SARS-CoV2 infected TB cases and the number of severe patients. The modelling used estimated R0 for two scenarios, without any intervention and with public health interventions. RESULTS: We observed that the peak of SARS-CoV-2-TB co-infected patients would occur on the 94th day in absence of public health interventions and on 138th day in presence of interventions. There could be 20,880 SARS-CoV-2 infected TB cases on peak day of epidemic when interventions are implemented and 27,968 cases in the absence of intervention. Among them, there could be 14,823 patients with severe disease when no interventions are implemented and 11,066 patients with severe disease in the presence of intervention. CONCLUSION: The importance of primary prevention measures needs to be emphasized especially in TB patients. The TB treatment centres and hospitals needs to be prepared for early diagnosis and management of severe COVID-19 in TB patients.","Marimuthu, Yamini; Nagappa, Bharathnag; Sharma, Nandini; Basu, Saurav; Chopra, Kamal Kishore",Indian J Tuberc,142,18

We report our experience of COVID-19 with stroke at a single center over a period of eight months spanning 1 March to 31 October 2020. Methods: We recruited all patients admitted to Internal Medicine with an acute stroke, who also tested positive for COVID-19 on RTPCR. We included all stroke cases in our analysis for prediction of in-hospital mortality, and separately analyzed arterial infarcts for vascular territory of ischemic strokes. Results: There were 62 stroke cases among 3923 COVID-19 admissions (incidence 1.6%). Data was available for 58 patients {mean age 52.6 years;age range 17–91;F/M=20/38;24% (14/58) aged ≤40;51% (30/58) hypertensive;36% (21/58) diabetic;41% (24/58) with O2 saturation <95% at admission;32/58 (55.17 %) in-hospital mortality}. Among 58 strokes, there were 44 arterial infarcts, seven bleeds, three arterial infarcts with associated cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, two combined infarct and bleed, and two of indeterminate type. Among the total 49 infarcts, Carotid territory was the commonest affected (36/49;73.5%), followed by vertebrobasilar (7/49;14.3%) and both (6/49;12.2%). Concordant arterial block was seen in 61% (19 of 31 infarcts with angiography done). ‘Early stroke’ (within 48 hours of respiratory symptoms) was seen in 82.7% (48/58) patients. Patients with poor saturation at admission were older (58 vs 49 years) and had more comorbidities and higher mortality (79% vs 38%). Mortality was similar in young strokes and older patients, although the latter required more intense respiratory support. Logistic regression analysis showed that low Glasgow coma score (GCS) and requirement for increasing intensity of respiratory support predicted in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: We had a 1.6% incidence of COVID-19 related stroke of which the majority were carotid territory infarcts. In-hospital mortality was 55.17%, predicted by low GCS at admission. © 2021 Journal of Association of Physicians of India. All rights reserved.","Sundar, U.; Karnik, N.

In China, people who have a history of contact with infected or suspected individuals need to quarantine for at least 2 weeks. Many people experienced anxiety, panic and depression in the quarantine period. However, acute manic episode triggered by stressful events is not common and was neglected.

She was diagnosed with acute manic episode finally. The social zeitgeber and reward hypersensitivity theoretical models have attempted to use psychobiological perspectives to determine why life stress can trigger a mood episode, including (hypo)mania. Besides, the temporal correlation between her somatic symptoms and psychological stimuli indicated a possibility of functional disturbance under acute stress. CONCLUSION: Quarantine is a major stressful event disrupting social zeitgebers for people who have had contact with infected individuals, especially for vulnerable individuals with a hypersensitive reward system. Stress could act as a trigger in the onset of manic episode, so psychological support should be more targeted at the vulnerable individuals in the initial phase of emergent crisis.","Yin, Xiaowen; Sun, Yuyong; Zhu, Chunyan; Zhu, Beiying; Gou, Dongfang; Tan, Zhonglin",J Affect Disord,142,16

The biosensor involves a disposable carbon electrode substrate doubly nanostructured with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and AuNPs modified with pyrene carboxylic acid (PCA) and 6-ferrocenylhexanethiol (Fc-SH), respectively. A synthetic amino terminated DNA capture probe was covalently immobilized on the CO2H moieties of PCA/rGO, while Fc-SH was used as a signaling molecule. Differential pulse voltammetry was employed to record the decrease in the oxidation peak current of Fc after the hybridization due to the hindering of the electron transfer upon the formation of the DNA-RNA duplex on the electrode surface. The stepwise biosensor preparation was characterized by surface and electrochemical techniques showing the role played by each biosensor component as well as the reliability of the target miRNA determination. The determination of the oncogene miRNA-21 synthetic target allowed quantification in the low femtomolar range (LOD of 5 fM) with a high discrimination of single-base mismatched sequences in a single 30-min incubation step.

However, there have been instances when the infected person forgets his/her contact-persons and does not have their contact details. Therefore, this study aimed at analyzing possible opportunities and challenges of integrating emerging technologies into COVID-19 contact tracing. METHODS: The study applied literature search from Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE and WHO COVID-19 reports and guidelines analyzed. RESULTS: While the integration of technology-based contact tracing applications to combat COVID-19 and break transmission chains promise to yield better results, these technologies face challenges such as technical limitations, dealing with asymptomatic individuals, lack of supporting ICT infrastructure and electronic health policy, socio-economic inequalities, deactivation of mobile devices' WIFI, GPS services, interoperability and standardization issues, security risks, privacy issues, political and structural responses, ethical and legal risks, consent and voluntariness, abuse of contact tracing apps, and discrimination. CONCLUSION: Integrating emerging technologies into COVID-19 contact tracing is seen as a viable option that policymakers, health practitioners and IT technocrats need to seriously consider in mitigating the spread of coronavirus. Further research is also required on how best to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the utilisation of emerging technologies in contact tracing while observing the security and privacy of people in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mbunge, Elliot",Diabetes Metab Syndr,142,16

Several prior studies have calculated excess deaths in the United States but were limited to the national or state level, precluding an examination of area-level variation in excess mortality and excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19. In this study, we take advantage of county-level variation in COVID-19 mortality to estimate excess deaths associated with the pandemic and examine how the extent of excess mortality not assigned to COVID-19 varies across subsets of counties defined by sociodemographic and health characteristics. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this ecological, cross-sectional study, we made use of provisional National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data on direct COVID-19 and all-cause mortality occurring in US counties from January 1 to December 31, 2020 and reported before March 12, 2021. We used data with a 10-week time lag between the final day that deaths occurred and the last day that deaths could be reported to improve the completeness of data. Our sample included 2,096 counties with 20 or more COVID-19 deaths. The total number of residents living in these counties was 319.1 million. On average, the counties were 18.7% Hispanic, 12.7% non-Hispanic Black, and 59.6% non-Hispanic White. A total of 15.9% of the population was older than 65 years. We first modeled the relationship between 2020 all-cause mortality and COVID-19 mortality across all counties and then produced fully stratified models to explore differences in this relationship among strata of sociodemographic and health factors. Overall, we found that for every 100 deaths assigned to COVID-19, 120 all-cause deaths occurred (95% CI, 116 to 124), implying that 17% (95% CI, 14% to 19%) of excess deaths were ascribed to causes of death other than COVID-19 itself. Our stratified models revealed that the percentage of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 was substantially higher among counties with lower median household incomes and less formal education, counties with poorer health and more diabetes, and counties in the South and West. Counties with more non-Hispanic Black residents, who were already at high risk of COVID-19 death based on direct counts, also reported higher percentages of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19. Study limitations include the use of provisional data that may be incomplete and the lack of disaggregated data on county-level mortality by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and sociodemographic and health characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that direct COVID-19 death counts in the US in 2020 substantially underestimated total excess mortality attributable to COVID-19. Racial and socioeconomic inequities in COVID-19 mortality also increased when excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 were considered. Our results highlight the importance of considering health equity in the policy response to the pandemic.","Stokes, Andrew C; Lundberg, Dielle J; Elo, Irma T; Hempstead, Katherine; Bor, Jacob; Preston, Samuel H",PLoS Med,142,30

Clinical signs help guide initial diagnosis, though definitive diagnosis is made using the laboratory technique reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The chest x-ray (CXR) is used as the primary imaging investigation in the United Kingdom (UK) for patients with suspected COVID-19. In some hospitals these CXRs may be reported by a radiographer. METHODS: Retrospective review of CXR reports by radiographers for suspected COVID-19 patients attending the Emergency Department (ED) of a hospital in the UK. Interpretation and use of the British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) coding system was assessed. Report description and code use were cross-checked. Report and code usage were checked against the RT-PCR result to determine accuracy. Report availability was checked against the availability of the RT-PCR result. A confusion matrix was utilised to determine performance. The data were analysed manually using Excel. RESULTS: Sample size was 320 patients; 54.1% male patients (n = 173), 45.9% female patients (n = 147). The correct code matched report descriptions in 316 of the 320 cases (98.8%). In 299 of the 320 cases (93.4%), the reports were available before the RT-PCR swab result. CXR sensitivity for detecting COVID-19 was 85% compared to 93% for the initial RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: Reporting radiographers can adequately utilise and apply the BSTI classification system when reporting COVID-19 CXRs. They can recognise the classic CXR appearances of COVID-19 and those with normal appearances. Future best practice includes checking laboratory results when reporting CXRs with ambiguous appearances. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Utilisation of reporting radiographers to report CXRs in any future respiratory pandemic should be considered a service-enabling development.","Stevens, Barry J",,142,16

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study starting on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques. Symptoms of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and acute stress (Acute Stress Disorder Inventory) were compared between people over and under 60 years old. Gender differences and the relationship of loneliness, regular exercise, economic losses and use of anxiolytics on the mental state were evaluated. Results: One thousand six hundred thirty-nine (150 [9.2%] aged &gt;= 60) participants completed the survey. The greater than or equal to 60 group showed lower mean (SD) BDI levels than the less than 60 group (3.02 [3.28] versus 4.30 [4.93]);and lower mean (SD) acute stress disorder inventory scores than the less than 60 group (3.68 [3.20] versus 4.45 [3.06]). There were no gender differences in any of the clinical measures. The presence of economic losses as well as the increase in the use of anxiolytics was significantly associated with higher emotional distress in the elderly compared to the younger group. Conclusions: Older people have shown less emotional distress, with no differences between men and women. Economic loss and substance use should be monitored to guarantee the emotional well-being of the elderly.

Diagnosis, indication for POC testing, hospitalisation time, antimicrobial therapy and readmission or death within one month of testing were obtained from patient records.ResultsA valid indication for POC testing was established in 168 (93.3%) of children and 334 (89.1%) of adults. A positive POCT result significantly reduced antibiotic prescription and median hospitalisation time by 44.3 hours for adults and 14.2 hours for children, and significantly increased antiviral treatment in adults. Risk of readmission or death was not significantly altered by a positive result. Testing for 26 respiratory pathogens established that risk of coinfection is lower with increasing age and that POCT for adults should be restricted to the influenza and RSV season.ConclusionPositive POCT resulted in changed patient management for both children and adults, and was deemed safe. POCT for additional pathogens may be beneficial in children below 5 years of age and outside the influenza and RSV season.","Schneider, Uffe Vest; Holm, Mona Katrine Alberthe; Bang, Didi; Petersen, Randi Føns; Mortensen, Shila; Trebbien, Ramona; Lisby, Jan Gorm",Euro surveill,142,16

However, accurately mapping the time-to-event of hospital outcomes, such as the LoS in the intensive care unit (ICU), requires understanding patient trajectories while adjusting for covariates and observation bias, such as incomplete data. Standard methods, such as the Kaplan-Meier estimator, require prior assumptions that are untenable given current knowledge. Using real-time surveillance data from the first weeks of the COVID-19 epidemic in Galicia (Spain), we aimed to model the time-to-event and event probabilities of patients' hospitalised, without parametric priors and adjusting for individual covariates. We applied a non-parametric mixture cure model and compared its performance in estimating hospital ward (HW)/ICU LoS to the performances of commonly used methods to estimate survival. We showed that the proposed model outperformed standard approaches, providing more accurate ICU and HW LoS estimates. Finally, we applied our model estimates to simulate COVID-19 hospital demand using a Monte Carlo algorithm. We provided evidence that adjusting for sex, generally overlooked in prediction models, together with age is key for accurately forecasting HW and ICU occupancy, as well as discharge or death outcomes.","López-Cheda, Ana; Jácome, María-Amalia; Cao, Ricardo; De Salazar, Pablo M",Epidemiol Infect,142,16

To fight this recession, policy makers in central banks engaged in expansionary monetary policy. This paper asks whether the measures adopted by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) have been effective in boosting real activity and calming financial markets. To measure these effects at high frequencies, we propose a novel mixed frequency vector autoregressive (MF-VAR) model. This model allows us to combine weekly and monthly information within a unified framework. Our model combines a set of macroeconomic aggregates such as industrial production, unemployment rates, and inflation with high-frequency information from financial markets such as stock prices, interest rate spreads, and weekly information on the Fed's balance sheet size. The latter set of high-frequency time series is used to dynamically interpolate the monthly time series to obtain weekly macroeconomic measures. We use this setup to simulate counterfactuals in absence of monetary stimulus. The results show that the monetary expansion caused higher output growth and stock market returns, more favorable long-term financing conditions and a depreciation of the US dollar compared with a no-policy benchmark scenario.","Feldkircher, Martin; Huber, Florian; Pfarrhofer, Michael",Scottish journal of political economy,142,22

The link of these morbidities with renin angiotensin system (RAS) and angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as the site of the multiplication of COVID-19 has widely been accepted. The objective of this research report was to delineate the clinical characteristics with COVID-19 infection with RAS and to consider its significance not just for the search of novel antiviral drugs, but for the management and prevention of death of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: It was a retrospective case series analysis of demographic and clinical data with associated comorbidities of 206 deaths reported in India up to 10th April 2020. The data were available from the official release from Ministry of Health and Family welfare, Government of India. This was followed by a literature search to correlate the available evidence for their possible relationship with RAS. RESULTS: The demographic data were consistent with those reported from other countries. The death (53.4%) was more common in patients with age above 60 years and men (69.3%) were more susceptible as compared to women (30.68%).We found that 50.5% of the deceased patients had pre-existing comorbidities. Diabetes and hypertension were the major comorbidities in 27.8% and 22.1% of the deceased cases respectively. Although respiratory and cardiac problems were prevalent at the time of death, the pre-existing pulmonary disease was comparatively less prevalent. Only 13.6% of the deceased were having pre-existing respiratory problems and 6.2% had cardiac ailments. We could correlate the reports that RAS plays a significant role in the prognosis of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and hypertension are at greater risk for developing COVID-19 infection.

However, health is reported to be less active in climate adaptation than other sectors. To contribute to better understanding urban health adaptation efforts and identifying gaps we developed a City Climate Health Adaptation Typology and tested it with adaptation actions of 106 large world cities (population > 1 million) reported to a major publicly-available adaptation database. We found two-thirds of actions of these 'active adapter' cities were health-associated. Half were health information activities (e.g., hazard mapping, early warnings); and nearly one-third addressed climate-relevant health determinants in the urban built environment (e.g., green space). Forty percent of cities were in low- or middle-income countries. Our proposed typology provides a systematic framework for monitoring and comparing city health adaptation actions. Reported city actions are suggestive of increasing depth and breadth of urban health-associated adaptation. However, even among these adaptation-engaged cities, a health adaptation gap was apparent in key climate health services (e.g., mental health), and in climate-related public health governance and capacity building. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated pressing need for strong public health institutions. We recommend better integration of public health agencies into local climate action planning, enhanced modes of collaboration between health and non-health agencies and with non-governmental actors, and strengthening of city public health adaptive capacity including through networking.","Sheehan, Mary C; Freire, Mila; Martinez, Gerardo Sanchez",Environ Res,142,21

METHODS: RapidPlan models in the Eclipse version 15.6 were used with the data of 28, 42, and 20 patients with head and neck, pancreatic, and rectal cancer, respectively. RapidPlan models of head and neck, pancreatic, and rectal cancer were created for TrueBeam STx (High Definition 120) with 6 MV, TrueBeam STx with 10-MV flattening filter-free, and Clinac iX (Millennium 120) with 15 MV, respectively. The models were used to create volumetric-modulated arc therapy plans for a 10-patient test dataset using all energy and MLC types at all disease sites. The Holm test was used to compare multiple dosimetric indices in different treatment machines and energy types. RESULTS: The dosimetric indices for planning target volume and organs at risk in RapidPlan model-based plans were comparable to those in the clinical plan. Furthermore, no dose difference was observed among the RapidPlan models. The variability among RapidPlan models was consistent regardless of the treatment machines, MLC types, and energy. CONCLUSIONS: Dosimetric indices of RapidPlan model-based plans appear to be comparable to the ones based on clinical plans regardless of energies, MLC types, and disease sites. The results suggest that the RapidPlan model can generate treatment plans independent of the type of treatment machine.","Hirashima, Hideaki; Nakamura, Mitsuhiro; Mukumoto, Nobutaka; Ashida, Ryo; Fujii, Kota; Nakamura, Kiyonao; Nakajima, Aya; Sakanaka, Katsuyuki; Yoshimura, Michio; Mizowaki, Takashi",J. appl. clin. med. phys,142,6

DESIGN: Cross-sectional staff survey. SETTING: All staff grades and types across primary and secondary care in a single National Health Service organisation. PARTICIPANTS: 257 staff members completed the survey, 251 had a work-related burnout score and 239 records were used in the regression analysis. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Work-related burnout as measured by the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory; (2) factors associated with work-related burnout identified through a multiple linear regression model; and (3) factors associated with work-related burnout identified through thematic analysis of free text responses. RESULTS: After adjusting for other covariates (including age, sex, job, being able to take breaks and COVID-19 knowledge), we observed meaningful changes in work-related burnout associated with having different COVID-19 roles (p=0.03), differences in the ability to rest and recover during breaks (p<0.01) and having personal protective equipment concerns (p=0.04). Thematic analysis of the free text comments also linked burnout to changes in workload and responsibility and to a lack of control through redeployment and working patterns. Reduction in non-COVID-19 services has resulted in some members of staff feeling underutilised, with feelings of inequality in workload. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses support anecdotal reports of staff struggling with the additional pressures brought on by COVID-19. All three of the factors we found to be associated with work-related burnout are modifiable and hence their effects can be mitigated. When we next find ourselves in extraordinary times the ordinary considerations of rest and protection and monitoring of the impact of new roles will be more important than ever.","Gemine, Rachel; Davies, Gareth R; Tarrant, Suzanne; Davies, Richard M; James, Meryl; Lewis, Keir",BMJ Open,142,1

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort with 125 women evaluated in the immediate postpartum period (before the pandemic - T1) in Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, 3 months (pandemic onset - T2) and 6 months (pandemic peak - T3) after birth by email and WhatsApp. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were applied. RESULTS: Fifty puerperal women participated in the three periods of the study. The median age was 25 years. There was an inverse correlation between the ââ FSFI and EPDS values at T2 (p < 0.001) and T3 (p < 0.001), demonstrating that the worsening sexual response was secondary to the higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in the puerperium in the COVID-19 pandemic. There was an increase in EPDS scores in the three periods: at T1, the EPDS scores ââwere 5.0 (2.0-9.0), increasing to 7.0 (4.0-14.0) at T2 and 6.5 (3.0-13.0) at T3 (p = 0.004). There was no difference between the FSFI index at the three evaluated times. CONCLUSIONS: Puerperal women are a susceptible subgroup for sexual dysfunction and depressive symptoms, which are correlated to each other and worsen in periods of stress, therefore, it is mandatory to investigate depressive symptoms in puerperal women with sexual complaints, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lorentz, Marcela Siliprandi; Chagas, Luciana Borges; Perez, Amanda Vilaverde; da Silva Cassol, Paulo Antonio; Vettorazzi, Janete; Lubianca, Jaqueline Neves",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,142,26

METHODS: The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform database was searched for registers of RCTs evaluating HQ or chloroquine, alone or in combination, compared with other treatments for patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The final search was performed on 8 April 2020. RESULTS: Among 51 registered RCTs (median sample size 262; interquartile range: 100, 520), 34 (67%) reported a clinical outcome, 12 (24%) a surrogate outcome, and 5 (10%) a combination of clinical and surrogate outcomes as primary endpoints. Six (15%) trials included the World Health Organization scale for clinical improvement as a primary clinical outcome. Clinical improvement and mortality accounted for 45% of the unique domains among 18 clinical outcome domains of efficacy. Twenty-four (47%) RCTs did not describe plans to assess safety outcomes; when assessed, safety outcomes were determined in generic terms of total, severe or serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: The RCTs investigating HQ or chloroquine during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic included heterogeneous and insufficient approaches to measure efficacy/effectiveness and safety relevant to patients and clinical practice. These findings provide insights to inform clinical and regulatory decisions that can be drawn about the efficacy/effectiveness and safety of these agents in patients with COVID-19. Trialists need to adapt quickly to the research progress on COVID-19, ensuring that core outcome measures are assessed in ongoing RCTs.","Junqueira, Daniela R; Rowe, Brian H",,142,30

The current study aimed to further characterize the change in neuropsychologists' professional practice, specifically related to teleneuropsychology (TNP) service provision, and also provide novel data regarding the impact of the pandemic on providers' emotional health. Method: This study surveyed 142 neuropsychologists between 3/30/2020 and 4/10/2020, who worked within a variety of settings (e.g., academic medical centers, general hospitals, Veterans Affairs medical centers, rehabilitation hospitals) across all four U.S. geographic regions. Mixed-model analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted to assess for differences in neuropsychological practice (i.e., total number of patients and proportion of TNP seen per week) across time points (i.e., late February and early April) by practice setting and region. Descriptive statistics were conducted to describe respondents' perceptions of TNP, emotional responses to the pandemic, and perceptions of institutional/employers'/practices' responses. Results: Nearly all respondents (â¼98%) reported making practice alterations, with â¼73% providing at least some TNP. Neuropsychologists across all settings and regions reported performing a higher proportion of TNP evaluations by April 2020. On average, respondents reported a medium amount of distress/anxiety related to COVID-19, which had a ""somewhat small impact"" on their ability to practice overall. Conclusions: The current study further elucidated neuropsychologists' provision of TNP services and offered initial data related to their emotional response to the pandemic.

This qualitative case study highlights one online parent education and training (PET) program developed during the pandemic to offer home-intervention strategies to parents of children with ASD in mainland China. This exploratory study sought to examine the emic perspectives of the trainers and parents who participated in the 12-week intensive training program while considering the cultural context in China and the transnational, remote nature of the program. METHODS: The primary data focused on the experiences of the trainers and parents within PET program's structure and strategies, which were adapted from the Training of Trainers model, and were collected from semi-structured, in-depth individual and focus group interviews conducted virtually with trainers (n = 4). Supplemental data sources included training session materials and feedback forms collected from parents (n = 294) at the midpoint and end of the program. After the collected data were sorted and condensed, a thematic analysis was performed using the data analysis spiral to further organize and code the data, and the codes were finally collapsed into themes. FINDINGS: Three overarching themes were identified: (1) training as modeling with resources, (2) dilemmas in cultural contexts and expectations, and (3) cultivating parent support networks. CONCLUSION: The online PET program became a hub of support networks and learning spaces for parents of children with ASD in different regions in China during the pandemic. Through the interactive virtual training sessions, parents were supported by continuous feedback on their home intervention and coached to cultivate support networks among themselves despite tensions arising from cultural differences and to implement effective intervention strategies that were individualized and authenticated to their specific familial needs.","McDevitt, Seung Eun",Res Dev Disabil,142,8

This presents a number of challenges associated with considerable uncertainty over the natural history of the disease and the number and characteristics of patients affected, and the emergence of new potential therapies. These challenges make adaptive designs for clinical trials a particularly attractive option. Such designs allow a trial to be modified on the basis of interim analysis data or stopped as soon as sufficiently strong evidence has been observed to answer the research question, without compromising the trial's scientific validity or integrity. In this paper we describe some of the adaptive design approaches that are available and discuss particular issues and challenges associated with their use in the pandemic setting. Our discussion is illustrated by details of four ongoing COVID-19 trials that have used adaptive designs.","Stallard, Nigel; Hampson, Lisa; Benda, Norbert; Brannath, Werner; Burnett, Tom; Friede, Tim; Kimani, Peter K.; Koenig, Franz; Krisam, Johannes; Mozgunov, Pavel; Posch, Martin; Wason, James; Wassmer, Gernot; Whitehead, John; Williamson, S.

Researchers don’t know exactly the degree to which people believe the misinformation they see online, but, in the case of COVID-19, belief in conspiracy theories related to the virus is associated with people being less willing to get vaccinated, potentially putting public health at risk. There’s no silver bullet to countering the online misinformation that can lead to these sorts of consequential misperceptions, but the good news is that multiple overlapping misinformation interventions, including correcting false information, can help. © 2021 Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.","Bode, L.; Vraga, E.",Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,142,26

However, since both the environment and any population are spatially heterogeneous, it is obviously desirable to include spatial structure into an epidemic model. Individuals with tuberculosis can spread the disease by moving from one area to another. In addition, people travel by air between cities, so diseases can be spread quickly between very distant places (as was the case with the COVID-19). In our model, each region's studied population is divided into five compartments S, L1, I, L2, and R. Further, we introduce in our discrete systems three control variables which represent the effectiveness rates of vaccination, travel-blocking operation, and treatment. We focus in our study to control the outbreaks of an epidemic that affects a hypothetical population belonging to a specific region. Firstly, we analyze the epidemic model when the control strategy is based on the vaccination control only, and secondly, when the travel-blocking control is added, we finish with the introduction of the treatment control. The optimal control theory, based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, is applied thrice in this paper, for the characterizations of the vaccination, travel-blocking, and treatment controls. The numerical results associated with the multipoint boundary value problems are obtained based on the forward-backward sweep method combined with progressive-regressive Runge–Kutta fourth-order schemes.

The objective of this work is to describe the activities promoted by the pharmacist in the care of the critically ill patient in this context. A new organizational structure was designed, analyzing the tasks necessary to make the processes profitable. Two pharmacists joined the critical patient care to help the pharmacist who was already integrated in the ICU team. The development of the operational structure was carried out on three levels. The healthcare activity highlights the daily participation of pharmacists in the two clinical sessions in which the ICU teams evaluated all cases and made decisions. This in turn facilitated the pharmaceutical validation that was carried out in the critical units themselves. In addition, one of the pharmacists created the Immuno-COVID Committee, in which they participated together with different specialists for therapeutic decision-making in the most complex cases. On the other hand, the availability of human and material resources allowed the implantation of centralized elaboration in the Pharmacy Service of many intravenous mixtures, including antibiotics elastomers Pumps for continuous infusion, and non-sterile elaborations. In logistics management, in addition to the acquisition of COVID- 19 therapies, the reconciliation with nursing activity stands out. The physical presence of the pharmacist favored the detection of needs, the availability in time of medications in the unit, including sterile and non-sterile preparations, and coordination with the central pharmacy. In knowledge management, the participation of the pharmacist in the working group for the development of the hospital management protocol COVID-19 stands out. The daily presence in the unit and the joint work with the entire multidisciplinary team demonstrate the value that the pharmacist can bring. In addition to efficient resource management, support for clinical decision-making and improvement actions, it provides the climate of inter-professional trust necessary to respond to the complexity of the critical patient and promote joint projects.","García-Gil, Mario; Velayos-Amo, Carlos",Farm Hosp,142,24

METHODS: A cross-sectional online questionnaire design was used Data were collected from March 14, 2020, to March 16, 2020, in Wuhan, China. Descriptive statistics and &#967;2 analyses testing were used. RESULTS: Standard nosocomial infection training could significantly decrease the occurrence of infection (3.6% vs 13.0%, &#967;2 = 4.47, P < 0.05). Discomfort can be classified into 7 categories. Female sex (66.0% vs 50.5%, &#967;2 = 6.37), occupation (62.7% vs 30.8%, &#967;2 = 5.33), working at designated hospitals (44.8% vs 26.7%, &#967;2 = 5.17) or in intensive care units (70.4% vs 57.9%, &#967;2 = 3.88), and working in personal protective equipment for > 4 hours (62.2% vs 39.2%, &#967;2 = 9.17) led to more complaints about physical discomfort or increased occurrence of pressure sores (all P < 0.05). Psychologically, health care workers at designated hospitals (60.0% vs 42.1%, &#967;2 = 4.97) or intensive care units (55.9% vs 41.5%, &#967;2 = 4.40) (all P < 0.05) expressed different rates of pride. DISCUSSION: Active training on infection and protective equipment could reduce the infection risk. Working for long hours increased the occurrence of discomfort and skin erosion. Reducing the working hours and having adequate protective products and proper psychological interventions may be beneficial to relieve discomfort.","Xia, Wei; Fu, Lin; Liao, Haihan; Yang, Chan; Guo, Haipeng; Bian, Zhouyan",J Emerg Nurs,142,10

Hundreds of thousands of people have succumbed to the disease. Efforts at curing the disease are aimed at finding a vaccine and/or developing antiviral drugs. Despite these efforts, the WHO warned that the virus might never be eradicated. Countries around the world have instated non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and wearing of masks in public to curb the spreading of the disease. Antiviral polysaccharides provide the ideal opportunity to combat the pathogen via pharmacotherapeutic applications. However, a layer-by-layer nanocoating approach is also envisioned to coat surfaces to which humans are exposed that could harbor pathogenic coronaviruses. By coating masks, clothing, and work surfaces in wet markets among others, these antiviral polysaccharides can ensure passive prevention of the spreading of the virus. It poses a so-called ""eradicate-in-place"" measure against the virus. Antiviral polysaccharides also provide a green chemistry pathway to virus eradication since these molecules are primarily of biological origin and can be modified by minimal synthetic approaches. They are biocompatible as well as biodegradable. This surface passivation approach could provide a powerful measure against the spreading of coronaviruses.","Otto, Daniel P; de Villiers, Melgardt M",Molecules (Basel),142,20

Treatment options for coronaviruses are limited. Here we show that clofazimine-an anti-leprosy drug with a favourable safety profile3-possesses inhibitory activity against several coronaviruses, and can antagonize the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in a range of in vitro systems. We found that this molecule, which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, inhibits cell fusion mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein, as well as activity of the viral helicase. Prophylactic or therapeutic administration of clofazimine in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis led to reduced viral loads in the lung and viral shedding in faeces, and also alleviated the inflammation associated with viral infection. Combinations of clofazimine and remdesivir exhibited antiviral synergy in vitro and in vivo, and restricted viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract. Clofazimine, which is orally bioavailable and comparatively cheap to manufacture, is an attractive clinical candidate for the treatment of outpatients and-when combined with remdesivir-in therapy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, particularly in contexts in which costs are an important factor or specialized medical facilities are limited.

However, massive generations of contaminated face mask cause environmental concerns because current disposal processes (i.e., incineration and reclamation) for them release toxic chemicals. The disposable mask is made of different compounds, making it hard to be recycled. In this regard, this work suggests an environmentally benign disposal process, simultaneously achieving the production of valuable fuels from the face mask. To this end, CO 2-assisted thermo-chemical process was conducted. The first part of this work determined the major chemical constituents of a disposable mask: polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon, and Fe. In the second part, pyrolysis study was employed to produce syngas and C 1-2hydrocarbons (HCs) from the disposable mask. To enhance syngas and C 1-2HCs formations, multi-stage pyrolysis was used for more C–C and C–H bonds scissions of the disposable mask. Catalytic pyrolysis over Ni/SiO 2further expedited H 2and CH 4formations due to its capability for dehydrogenation. In the presence of CO 2, catalytic pyrolysis additionally produced CO, while pyrolysis in N 2did not produce it. Therefore, the thermo-chemical conversion of disposable face mask and CO 2could be an environmentally benign way to remove COVID-19 plastic waste, generating value-added products.","Jung, Sungyup; Lee, Sangyoon; Dou, Xiaomin; Kwon, Eilhann E.",Chem.

This study integrates geographical, demographical, and other key factors into a regression-based event study framework, to assess the effectiveness of seven major policies on human mobility and COVID-19 case growth rates, with a spatiotemporal emphasis. Our results demonstrate that stay-at-home orders, workplace closures, and public information campaigns were effective in decreasing the confirmed case growth rate. For stay-at-home orders and workplace closures, these changes were associated with significant decreases (p < 0.05) in mobility. Public information campaigns did not see these same mobility trends, but the growth rate still decreased significantly in all analysis periods (p < 0.01). Stay-at-home orders and international/national travel controls had limited mitigation effects on the death case growth rate (p < 0.1). The relationships between policies, mobility, and epidemiological metrics allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of each policy and gave us insight into the spatiotemporal patterns and mechanisms by which these measures work.

Thus, analyzing COVID-themed malicious domains from the angle of attack campaigns would help us gain a deeper understanding of the scale, scope and sophistication of the threats imposed by such malicious domains. In this paper, we collect data from multiple sources, and identify and characterize COVID-themed malicious domain campaigns, including the evolution of such campaigns, their underlying infrastructures and the different strategies taken by attackers behind these campaigns.

Case series have reported that people with obesity experience more severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have tended to gain weight because of environmental factors imposed by quarantine policies, such as decreased physical activity and increased consumption of unhealthy food. Mechanisms have been postulated to explain the association between COVID-19 and obesity. COVID-19 aggravates inflammation and hypoxia in people with obesity, which can lead to severe illness and the need for intensive care. The immune system is compromised in people with obesity and COVID-19 affects the immune system, which can lead to complications. Interleukin-6 and other cytokines play an important role in the progression of COVID-19. The inflammatory response, critical illness, and underlying risk factors may all predispose to complications of obesity such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. The common medications used to treat people with obesity, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues, statins, and antiplatelets agents, should be continued because these agents have anti-inflammatory properties and play protective roles against cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. It is also recommended that renin-angiotensin system blockers are not stopped during the COVID-19 pandemic because no definitive data about the harm or benefits of these agents have been reported. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social activities have been discouraged and exercise facilities have been closed. Under these restrictions, tailored lifestyle modifications such as home exercise training and cooking of healthy food are encouraged.","Lim, Soo; Shin, Soo Myoung; Nam, Ga Eun; Jung, Chang Hee; Koo, Bo Kyung",J Obes Metab Syndr,142,20

This study aimed to assess whether aminophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist, improves early graft function and reduces incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) and slow graft function (SGF). METHODS: Single center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial. Pediatric patients admitted for renal transplantation from donation after brain death donors were randomized into a treatment arm receiving aminophylline and a placebo arm receiving normal saline infusions. Primary outcome was estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 5 days post-transplant. Secondary outcomes were rates of DGF/SGF and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were randomized to aminophylline and 27 to placebo. There was no difference in day 5 eGFR, rate of DGF/SGF, or urine NGAL/Creatinine level between aminophylline vs. placebo arm (eGFR 67.39 ± 38.9 ml/min/1.73m2 vs. 80.48 ± 52.1 ml/min/1.73m2p = 0.32; DGF/SGF 5/23 (21.7%) vs. 3/27 (11.1%) p = 0.31; urine NGAL/creatinine 300.5 ng/mg IQR 105.5-1464.5 ng/mg vs. 425.4 ng/mg IQR 140.3-1126.2 ng/mg, p = 0.95; respectively). At 12 months, there was 100% patient survival and 98% graft survival. eGFR at 12 months was similar between the two arms. CONCLUSIONS: There was no benefit in peri-transplant aminophylline administration. Our results are limited by small sample size, since sample calculations were based on primary outcome of day 5 eGFR and low rate of DGF/SGF, which may have precluded us from demonstrating efficacy. Further clinical studies are necessary to determine any benefit of aminophylline in kidney transplant recipients, particularly from high-risk donors.","Haskin, Orly; Shih, Weiwen; Wong, Cynthia J; Axelrod, David M; Grimm, Paul C",Pediatr. nephrol,142,1

The main objective of the study was to quantify the changes in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) prior to and after initiation of the lockdown Design and method: A big data analysis of BP and HR measurements recorded during the lockdown period versus measurements during the Covid-19 period prior to con finement as well as versus measurements recorded in 2019. All participants were from the Paris urban area. Subjects used a Withings connected home blood pressure monitor and had at least one measurement prior to and during the lockdown and in 2019 Results: A total of 297,089 BP recordings were available from 2273 participants (age 56.3±12.8 years, 81.1% male). Recording frequency was similar before and during the lockdown. BP gradually decreased during the first 4 weeks of con finement reaching a decrease of 3 mmHg (-2.4 to-3.9) in systolic BP (SBP) and 1.5 mmHg (-1.4 to-2.2) in diastolic BP (DBP) from week 4 to week 7 (all p&lt;0.001) Age and sex-adjusted comparisons yielded similar results. Participants with higher SBP and DBP had a greater decrease in SBP and DBP during the lockdown (p&lt;0.0001 each);age and gender had no signi ficant effect. No signi ficant variation in HR was detected during the studied periods Conclusions: Our study demonstrates a progressive decrease in SBP and DBP during the lockdown that may partly explain the concomitant reported reduction in the incidence of acute cardiovascular diseases.","Girerd, N.; Meune, C.; Duarte, K.; Vercamer, V.; Lopez-Sublet, M.; Mourad, J.

In early January 2021, a novel variant of concern (VOC) designated B.1.429 comprising 2 lineages, B.1.427 and B.1.429, was originally detected in California (CA) and shown to enhance infectivity in vitro and decrease antibody neutralization by plasma from convalescent patients and vaccine recipients. Here we examine the virulence, transmissibility, and susceptibility to pre-existing immunity for B 1.427 and B 1.429 in the Syrian hamster model. We find that both strains exhibit enhanced virulence as measured by increased body weight loss compared to hamsters infected with ancestral B.1 (614G), with B.1.429 causing the most body weight loss among all 3 lineages. Faster dissemination from airways to parenchyma and more severe lung pathology at both early and late stages were also observed with B.1.429 infections relative to B.1. (614G) and B.1.427 infections. In addition, subgenomic viral RNA (sgRNA) levels were highest in oral swabs of hamsters infected with B.1.429, however sgRNA levels in lungs were similar in all three strains. This demonstrates that B.1.429 replicates to higher levels than ancestral B.1 (614G) or B.1.427 in the upper respiratory tract (URT) but not in the lungs. In multi-virus in-vivo competition experiments, we found that epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) and gamma (P.1) dramatically outcompete alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351) and zeta (P.2) in the lungs. In the URT gamma, and epsilon dominate, but the highly infectious alpha variant also maintains a moderate size niche. We did not observe significant differences in airborne transmission efficiency among the B.1.427, B.1.429 and ancestral B.1 (614G) variants in hamsters. These results demonstrate enhanced virulence and high relative fitness of the epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) variant in Syrian hamsters compared to an ancestral B.1 (614G) strain. Author SummaryIn the last 12 months new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have arisen in the UK, South Africa, Brazil, India, and California. New SARS-CoV-2 variants will continue to emerge for the foreseeable future in the human population and the potential for these new variants to produce severe disease and evade vaccines needs to be understood. In this study, we used the hamster model to determine the epsilon (B.1.427/429) SARS-CoV-2 strains that emerged in California in late 2020 cause more severe disease and infected hamsters have higher viral loads in the upper respiratory tract compared to the prior B.1 (614G) strain. These findings are consistent with human clinical data and help explain the emergence and rapid spread of this strain in early 2021.","Carroll, Timothy; Fox, Douglas; Doremalen, Neeltje van; Ball, Erin; Morris, Mary Kate; Sotomayor-Gonzalez, Alicia; Servellita, Venice; Rustagi, Arjun; Yinda, Claude Kwe; Fritts, Linda; Port, Julia Rebecca; Ma, Zhong-Min; Holbrook, Myndi; Schulz, Jonathan; Blish, Catherine A.; Hanson, Carl; Chiu, Charles Y.; Munster, Vincent; Stanley, Sarah; Miller, Christopher J",,142,16

We leverage novel and rich administrative and survey data on travel volumes, modes, and preferences for different demographic groups. Large average declines in travel and public transit use due to the pandemic and related policy responses mask substantial heterogeneity across socioeconomic groups. Travel declined considerably less among less-educated and lower-income individuals, even after accounting for mode substitution and variation across neighborhoods in the impacts of public transit service reductions. As policy became less restrictive and travel increased, the size of the socioeconomic gap in travel behavior remained stable, and remote work capabilities became increasingly important in explaining this gap.

In this study, we characterized the antibody response induced by the BNT162b2 vaccine in a group of health care workers, tested at baseline, after the first dose and after the booster. Thirty-nine subjects without previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 were vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine. IgM, IgG, and IgA anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) were tested by ELISA. Neutralizing antibodies were evaluated testing the inhibition of RBD binding to ACE2. Antibody avidity was measured by urea avidity ELISA. IgM anti-RBD are produced after the first dose of vaccine and persist after the booster. IgG and IgA anti-RBD antibodies are detected in high amounts in all the subjects after the first dose and further increase after the booster. A few subjects, already after the first dose, produce antibodies inhibiting RBD interaction with ACE2. After the booster, high levels of inhibitory antibodies are detected in all the subjects. Affinity maturation takes place with boosting and IgG anti-RBD avidity increases with the number of immunizations. A less pronounced increase is observed with IgA. These data indicate that the BNT162b2 vaccine can induce high levels of protective antibodies of high avidity in vaccinated subjects;both IgG and IgA anti-RBD antibodies are produced.

We call this partiality for compatriots in times of crisis ""crisis nationalism"". Vaccine nationalism is one vivid example of crisis nationalism during the COVID-19 pandemic; so is the case of the US government's purchasing a 3-month supply of the global stock of the antiviral Remdesivir for domestic use. Is crisis nationalism justifiable at all, and, if it is, what are its limits? We examine some plausible arguments for national partiality, and conclude that these arguments support crisis nationalism only within strict limits. The different arguments for partiality, as we will note, arrive at these limits for different reasons. But more generally, so we argue, any defensible crisis nationalism must not entail the violation of human rights or the worsening of people's deprivation. Moreover, we propose that good faith crisis nationalism ought to be sensitive to the potential moral costs of national partiality during a global crisis and must take extra care to control or offset these costs. Thus, crisis nationalism in the form of vaccine nationalism or the hoarding of global supplies of therapeutics during a global pandemic exceeds the bounds of acceptable partiality.","Beaton, Eilidh; Gadomski, Mike; Manson, Dylan; Tan, Kok-Chor",Ethical Theory Moral Pract,142,1

In previous studies, predictions were investigated for single or several countries and territories. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop models that can be applied for real-time prediction of COVID-19 activity in all individual countries and territories worldwide. METHODS: Data of the previous daily incidence and infoveillance data (search volume data via Google Trends) from 215 individual countries and territories were collected. A random forest regression algorithm was used to train models to predict the daily new confirmed cases 7 days ahead. Several methods were used to optimize the models, including clustering the countries and territories, selecting features according to the importance scores, performing multiple-step forecasting, and upgrading the models at regular intervals. The performance of the models was assessed using the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Our models can accurately predict the daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in most countries and territories. Of the 215 countries and territories under study, 198 (92.1%) had MAEs <10 and 187 (87.0%) had Pearson correlation coefficients >0.8. For the 215 countries and territories, the mean MAE was 5.42 (range 0.26-15.32), the mean RMSE was 9.27 (range 1.81-24.40), the mean Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.89 (range 0.08-0.99), and the mean Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.84 (range 0.2-1.00). CONCLUSIONS: By integrating previous incidence and Google Trends data, our machine learning algorithm was able to predict the incidence of COVID-19 in most individual countries and territories accurately 7 days ahead.","Peng, Yuanyuan; Li, Cuilian; Rong, Yibiao; Pang, Chi Pui; Chen, Xinjian; Chen, Haoyu",J Med Internet Res,142,16

Concerns exist that these disruptions caused by the pandemic may not have influenced men and women researchers equally.

Here we report the results of an analysis that compared the gender distribution of authors on 1893 medical papers related to the pandemic with that on papers published in the same journals in 2019, for papers with first authors and last authors from the United States. Using mixed-effects regression models, we estimated that the proportion of COVID-19 papers with a woman first author was 19% lower than that for papers published in the same journals in 2019, while our comparisons for last authors and overall proportion of women authors per paper were inconclusive. A closer examination suggested that women's representation as first authors of COVID-19 research was particularly low for papers published in March and April 2020. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the research productivity of women, especially early-career women, has been affected more than the research productivity of men.","Andersen, Jens Peter; Nielsen, Mathias Wullum; Simone, Nicole L; Lewiss, Resa E; Jagsi, Reshma",eLife (Cambridge),142,28

We report our experience of RT adapted schedules or strategy changes in older patients during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods and Materials: Patients aged &#8805;75 years were recruited during weekly chart rounds. All were potentially eligible for a specific intervention to reduce the frequency of patients' visits to the hospital. The impact of deferring radiation and hypofractionation of RT schedules was assessed in terms of the number of courses initially planned and re-planned during the lockdown. Results: Twenty patients were identified during the official lockdown in France (March 17 to May 11). Median age was 78y (75-95y). Most patients were male (n=12, 60%) being treated in the postoperative setting (n=17, 85%). RT was delayed in 11 cases (55%) with hormonal therapy prescribed in 10 cases (50%). Altered RT fractionation was proposed for five cases (25%) combinations of altered fractionation and deferral of radiation were applied in three cases (15%). The number of radiation courses initially planned and re-planned according to the pandemic context: 563 and 197 respectively (-62%; p<0.001). None presented recurrence when RT was initiated, and no patient developed symptomatic Covid-19 infection. Conclusions: In the context of the Covid-19 outbreak, individual risk-based radiation therapy seems to be safe. Systematic screening of patients for Covid-19 before starting radiotherapy is mandatory.

Proposed strategies to overcome these challenges include ensuring farmworkers are prioritized in vaccine allocation and provided cost-free vaccines at convenient locations through partnerships among health authorities, community- and faith-based groups, and health centers with trusted community relationships. Further, a portable immunization record should be used, and coordination of care continued when a farmworker moves to a new geographic location.

METHODS: Ninety-five consecutive patients (11 male, 84 female; mean BMI 45 ± 6 kg/m2) undergoing RYGB 9 ± 4 years ago were treated for 24 months as follows: Patients, who gained less than 10% from weight NADIR, served as controls and were provided lifestyle counseling (DC, n = 30). The others were allowed to choose between three different treatment groups: daily s.c. administration of liraglutide (LG, n = 34); endosurgery using Apollo's Overstitch System&#8482; (ES, n = 15), or implantation of a Fobi-ring with pouch resizing (FP, n = 16). RESULTS: Controls kept their weight stable during 24 months of study (- 0.1 ± 1.7 kg/m2). Weight loss was 4.8 ± 2.9 kg/m2 for LG and 5.5 ± 2.9 kg/m2 for FP, both losing more than 85% of regained weight from weight NADIR (p < 0.001). In contrast, weight loss in ES was 1.0 ± 0.9 kg/m2 (i.e., 20% of regained weight). Thirty-seven percent of FP experienced serious complications (p < 0.05) in contrast to the other groups. An improved prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia was observed in LG and FP (p < 0.02) 24 months after intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Weight regain during more than 6 years after RYGB can be safely and effectively reversed with liraglutide. Compared with revisional surgery, pharmacotherapy with liraglutide was low risk and resulted in an important improvement in hypertension and dyslipidemia. Therefore, daily subcutaneous injections of liraglutide are a valid option to treat weight regain after RYGB.","Horber, Fritz F; Steffen, Rudolf",Obes. surg,142,4

In response, Governor Charles Baker allocated $130 million in additional funding for 2 months contingent on compliance with a new set of care criteria including mandatory testing of all residents and staff, and a 28-point infection control checklist. We aimed to describe the Massachusetts effort and associated outcomes. DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: A total of 360 Massachusetts NHs. PARTICIPANTS: The Massachusetts Senior Care Association and Hebrew SeniorLife rapidly organized a Central Command team, targeted 123 ""special focus"" facilities with infection control deficiencies for on-site and virtual consultations, and offered all 360 facilities weekly webinars and answers to questions regarding infection control procedures. The facilities were also informed of resources for the acquisition of personal protective equipment (PPE), backup staff, and SARS-CoV-2 testing. MEASUREMENTS: We used two data sources: (1) four state audits of all NHs, and (2) weekly NH reports to the Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis. Primary independent process measures were the checklist scores and adherence to each of its six core competencies. Primary outcomes were the average weekly rates of new infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in residents and staff. We used a hurdle mixed effects model adjusted for county COVID-19 prevalence to estimate relationships between infection control process measures and rates of new infections or deaths. RESULTS: Both resident and staff infection rates started higher in special focus facilities, then rapidly declined to the same low level in both groups. Adherence to infection control processes, especially proper wearing of PPE and cohorting, was significantly associated with declines in weekly infection and mortality rates. CONCLUSION: This statewide effort could serve as a national model for other states to prevent the devastating effects of pandemics such as COVID-19 in frail NH residents.","Lipsitz, Lewis A; Lujan, Alida M; Dufour, Alyssa; Abrahams, Gary; Magliozzi, Helen; Herndon, Laurie; Dar, Mohammad",J. am. geriatr. soc,142,10

We consider different interruption scenarios, including reduced passive surveillance in fixed health facilities, and whether this suspension lasts until the end of 2020 or 2021. Our models predict an increase in the number of new infections in the interruption period only if both active screening and passive surveillance were suspended, and with a slowed reduction-but no increase-if passive surveillance remains fully functional. In all scenarios, the EOT may be slightly pushed back if no mitigation, such as increased screening coverage, is put in place. However, we emphasise that the biggest challenge will remain in the higher-prevalence regions where EOT is already predicted to be behind schedule without interruptions unless interventions are bolstered.","Aliee, Maryam; Castaño, Soledad; Davis, Christopher N; Patel, Swati; Miaka, Erick Mwamba; Spencer, Simon E F; Keeling, Matt J; Chitnis, Nakul; Rock, Kat S",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,142,16

Sulfur reduction can effectively reduce soluble selenite in large quantities to nontoxic solid elemental selenium, which plays a significant role in controlling the toxicity and cycle of selenium. In view of the bright prospects of the sulfur reduction reaction of selenite, this review comprehensively summarizes the continuous development in the sulfidation of selenite. First, the geochemical characteristics of aqueous selenium in different sulfur systems involving species distribution and various phase types at Eh-pH conditions were summarized. Second, sulfur reductions of selenite with chemical sulfide in natural water environments, sulfur reductase and extracellular polymer substances containing thiol groups in sulfate-reducing bacteria have been reviewed to further understand the corresponding mechanisms, rates and influencing factors. Furthermore, applications of sulfur reduction of selenium, including removal of selenium, enrichment of selenium, synthesis of selenoproteins and prevention of leakage of selenium, were also summarized. Finally, this review identified future research needs for the sulfidation of selenite for environmental applications.","Xiong, Jiaming; Wang, Hainan; Yao, Jinni; He, Qiang; Ma, Jun; Yang, Jingjing; Liu, Caihong; Chen, Yao; Huangfu, Xiaoliu; Liu, Hongxia",J Hazard Mater,142,23

Local communities of Siberia and the Arctic can be characterized by special skills of the autonomous existence and use of local medical knowledge in a situation of remoteness from resource distribution centers and relative isolation. In the light of modern changes and the risk of spread of infections, the local medical knowledge and skills accumulated by the representatives of these communities are turning into an important resource, which allows using survival and health maintaining strategies in severe climatic conditions and in situations of supply shortages. The article is based on the extensive field experience of the authors working in three different regions of Eastern Siberia, and includes materials collected among Chukchis, Evenkis, Buryats and Soyots. The existence in a situation of a relative isolation and remoteness formed among local people special ways of interacting with the state, the economic sphere and the natural environment, aimed at maintaining the existing autonomy regimes based on following the rules of environmental ethics, rational and economical use of available resources, their secondary use and utilization.

There are instances where AI has done marvels in the diagnosis of various health conditions and the interpretation of complex medical disorders. Although AI is far from human intelligence, it can be used as an effective tool to study the SARS-CoV-2 and its capabilities, virulence, and genome. The progress of the pandemic can be tracked, and the patients can be monitored, thereby speeding up the research for the treatment of COVID-19. In this review article, we highlighted the importance of AI and Machine learning (ML) techniques that can speed up the path to the discovery of a possible cure for COVID-19. We also deal with the interactions between viromics and AI, which can hopefully find a solution to this pandemic. Evidence Acquisition: A review of different articles was conducted using the following databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar for recent studies regarding the use of AI, seeking the spread of different infectious diseases using relevant MeSH subheadings. Results: After a thorough screening of different articles, 30 articles were considered, and key information was obtained from them. Finally, the scope was broadened to obtain more information. Our findings indicated that AI/ML is a promising approach to drug development. Conclusions: The field of AI has enormous potential to predict the changes that may take place in the environment. If this technology is applied to situations of a pandemic such as COVID-19, breakthroughs could potentially pave the way for new vaccines and antiviral drugs.","Kannan, Shantani; Subbaram, Kannan; Ali, Sheeza; Kannan, Hemalatha",Arch.

This beneficial effect was more pronounced in males compared with females. It is assumed that epigenetic modifications induced by maternal methyl-enriched diet in the offspring at the early stages of ontogenesis might be a possible mechanism underlying the correction of genetically-based pathologic phenotype in WAG/Rij rats.

Recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to suspend elective dental procedures and avoid aerosol-generating procedures posed significant challenges in the management of patients presenting with endodontic emergencies and uncertainty of outcomes for endodontic procedures initiated, but not completed, before shutdown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the success of palliative care on endodontic emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the stability of teeth with long-term Ca(OH)2 placement because of delays in treatment completion. METHODS: Patients presenting for endodontic emergencies during COVID-19 Shelter-in-Place orders received palliative care, including pharmacologic therapy and/or non-aerosol-generating procedural interventions. Part I of the study evaluated the effectiveness of palliative care, and need for aerosol-generating procedures or extractions was quantified. Part II of the study evaluated survivability and rate of adverse events for teeth that received partial or full root canal debridement and placement of calcium hydroxide before shutdown. RESULTS: Part I: Twenty-one patients presented with endodontic emergencies in 25 teeth during statewide shutdown. At a follow-up rate of 96%, 83% of endodontic emergencies required no further treatment or intervention after palliative care. Part II: Thirty-one teeth had received partial or full root canal debridement before statewide shutdown. Mean time to complete treatment was 13 weeks. At a recall rate of 100%, 77% of teeth did not experience any adverse events due to delays in treatment completion. The most common adverse event was a fractured provisional restoration (13%), followed by painful and/or infectious flare-up (6.4%), which were managed appropriately and therefore seemed successful. Only 1 tooth was fractured and nonrestorable (3%), leading to a failed outcome of tooth extraction. The remaining 4 outcome failures (13%) were due to patient unwillingness to undergo school-mandated COVID testing or patient unwillingness to continue treatment because of perceived risk of COVID infection. CONCLUSIONS: Palliative care for management of endodontic emergencies is a successful option when aerosol-generating procedures are restricted. This treatment approach may be considered in an effort to reduce risk of transmission of COVID-19 infection during subsequent shutdowns. Prolonged Ca(OH)2 medicament because of COVID-19 related delays in treatment completion appeared to have minimal effect on survival of teeth.","Patel, Biraj; Eskander, Michael A; Ruparel, Nikita B",J. endod,142,16

Patients who have received solid-organ transplants are more susceptible to infections in general due to the use of immunosuppressants. We investigated factors associated with mechanical ventilation and outcomes in solid-organ transplant recipients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all solid-organ transplant recipients admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 in our 23-hospital health system over a 1-month period. Descriptive statistics were used to describe hospital course and laboratory results and bivariate comparisons were performed on variables to determine differences. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with solid-organ transplants and COVID-19 were identified. Eight patients were admitted to the ICU, of which 7 were intubated. Admission values of CRP (p = 0.045) and N/L ratio (p = 0.047) were associated with the need for mechanical ventilation. Seven patients (32%) died during admission, including 86% (n = 6) of patients who received mechanical ventilation.

In this paper, we examine the dynamic effect on four major oil prices of COVID-19 with reference to China and Nigeria. We use daily frequency data, and employ structural vector autoregressive method for the analysis. We find that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic accounted for smallest shares of movement in Bonny and Daqing oil prices, only 14% in China’s Daqing and 17% in Nigeria’ Bonny, and the effect is even weaker on BRENT and WTI, 7% on each price as forecast error parameters indicate. This shows that the impact of infections of COVID-19 can short-lived and leave a minimal impact on economies, but the reaction of the market itself is subject matter. Thus, it is predicted that oil prices are likely to rise in future weeks as oil demand and major economies are expected to fully open and quickly recover. China may need to take advantage of the present low oil price to benefit its economy, while Nigeria may need to be careful in external borrowing binge embarked on to cushion the effect of oil price falls as it may debt-trap the economy.","Adedeji, Abdulkabir N.; Ahmed, Funmilola F.; Adam, Shehu U.",Energy,142,16

Although the respiratory tract is the primary target of SARS-CoV-2, accumulating evidence suggests that the virus may also invade both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) leading to numerous neurological issues including some serious complications such as seizures, encephalitis, and loss of consciousness. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the currently known role of SARS-CoV-2 and identify all the neurological problems reported among the COVID-19 case reports throughout the world. The virus might gain entry into the CNS either through the trans-synaptic route via the olfactory neurons or through the damaged endothelium in the brain microvasculature using the ACE2 receptor potentiated by neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). The most critical of all symptoms appear to be the spontaneous loss of breathing in some COVID-19 patients. This might be indicative of a dysfunction within the cardiopulmonary regulatory centers in the brainstem. These pioneering studies, thus, lay a strong foundation for more in-depth basic and clinical research required to confirm the role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in neurodegeneration of critical brain regulatory centers.","Karuppan, Mohan Kumar Muthu; Devadoss, Dinesh; Nair, Madhavan; Chand, Hitendra S; Lakshmana, Madepalli K",Mol.

The regions near the Amazon rainforest presented much higher and faster contaminations. This paper attempts to explain this phenomenon through a global analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil. It also investigates the relationship between climate conditions and airborne transmission with the evolution of contagion in the Amazonian states. The method of investigation of the spread of SARS-COV-2 in these different macro-environments was based on the analysis of three extensive daily official databases on the number of deaths, the percentage of adherence of the populations to the restriction policies, and the local climatic conditions. Besides, the social conditions in those States were also taken into account. Then, it was compared the epidemiologic results for States with very different climatic characteristics and that had adopted, almost simultaneously, similar social isolation measures. However, all these analyses were not able to explain the remarkable difference in the evolution of the pandemic among Brazilian regions. So, it was necessary to invoke airborne transmission, facilitated by the very high air humidity, as a decisive factor to explain the faster evolution of contagion in the rainforest region. Air humidity seems to be the most important climatic factor in viral spreading, while usual ambient temperatures do not have a strong influence. Another very important result of this analysis was the observation that the onset of collective immunity may have been achieved with a contamination rate of about 15% of the Amazonian population.","Crema, Edilson",Sci Total Environ,142,16

Perioperative management of a new tracheostomy is challenging as routine care, such as suctioning, frequently involves AGPs. We developed and implemented an apparatus called the heat and moisture exchanger (HME) filter-protected open circuit. This enabled closed suctioning to be performed and allowed spontaneously breathing patients to be managed with an open circuit in a shared environment while reducing the risk of viral aerosolisation. We performed a prospective observational study of 20 cases, recording the incidence of desaturation (<90%), apparatus disconnection, apparatus dislodgement and apparatus replacement. The ease of use of the apparatus for recovery nursing staff and patient comfort were measured on a Likert scale. There were no incidents of desaturation. There were two circuit disconnections. Apparatus replacement with an alternate circuit was not required for any patient. Most recovery nursing staff agreed or strongly agreed that the apparatus was easy to use and that the apparatus bulk or weight did not interfere with patient care activities. Ninety-five per cent of patients reported that their breathing was comfortable prior to discharge from the Post Anaesthesia Care Unit. In conclusion, the HME filter-protected open circuit is a relatively safe, acceptable and practical device to use for spontaneously breathing patients with newly created tracheostomies in the perioperative environment.","Koh, Way Siong Downing Megan Ng Irene",ACORN,142,1

The role of presymptomatic people in transmission has been shown to be important and the early detection of these people is critical for the control of new outbreaks. Pooling strategies have proven to preserve SARS-CoV-2 testing resources. The aims of the present study, based in our local experience, were (a) to describe SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in institutionalized people in Galicia (Spain) during the Coronavirus pandemic and (b) to evaluate the expected performance of a pooling strategy using RT-PCR for the next rounds of screening of institutionalized people. METHODS: A total of 25,386 Nasopharyngeal swab samples from the total of the residents and workers at Care Homes in Galicia (March to May 2020) were individually tested using RT-PCR. Prevalence and quantification cycle (Cq) value distribution of positives was calculated. Besides, 26 pools of 20 samples and 14 pools of 5 samples were tested using RT-PCR as well (1 positive/pool). Pooling proof of concept was performed in two populations with 1.7 and 2% prevalence. RESULTS: Distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection at Care Homes was uneven (0-60%). As the virus circulation global rate was low in our area (3.32%), the number of people at risk of acquiring the infection continues to be very high. In this work, we have successfully demonstrated that pooling of different groups of samples at low prevalence clusters, can be done with a small average delay on Cq values (5 and 2.85 cycles for pools of 20 and 5 samples, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A new screening system with guaranteed protection is required for small clusters, previously covered with individual testing. Our proposal for Care Homes, once prevalence zero is achieved, would include successive rounds of testing using a pooling solution for transmission control preserving testing resources. Scale-up of this method may be of utility to confront larger clusters to avoid the viral circulation and keeping them operative.","Cabrera Alvargonzalez, Jorge Julio; Rey Cao, Sonia; Pérez Castro, Sonia; Martinez Lamas, Lucía; Cores Calvo, Olaia; Torres Piñon, Julio; Porteiro Fresco, Jacobo; Garcia Comesaña, Julio; Regueiro Garcia, Benito",BMC Infect Dis,142,16

Transduction with CoroVaxG.3 expressing Spike (D614G) dramatically enhanced Spike expression in human muscle cells, monocytes and dendritic cells compared to CoroVaxG.5 that expressed the native fiber knob domain. A single dose of CoroVaxG.3 induced potent humoral immunity with a balanced Th1/Th2 ratio and potent T-cell immunity, both lasting for at least 5 months. Sera from CoroVaxG.3 vaccinated mice was able to neutralize pseudoviruses expressing B.1 (wild type D614G), B.1.117 (alpha) and P.1 (gamma) Spikes, as well as an authentic WT and P.1 SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Neutralizing antibodies did not wane even after 5 months making this kind of vaccine a likely candidate to enter clinical trials","Lopez, M. Veronica; Vinzon, Sabrina E; Cafferata, Eduardo G.

METHOD: Individuals with T2DM who had at least one consultation in one of 940 general (including diabetologist) practices in Germany between January and July 2019 (N = 79 268) and between January and July 2020 (N = 85 046) were included. Therapy changes were defined as the prescription of new glucose-lowering drugs, with or without the discontinuation of previous treatments (therapy switch and add-on therapy, respectively). The number of T2DM patients with at least one medication regimen change was calculated for the periods 1 January to 14 March in 2019 and 2020, and for the periods 15 March to 31 July in 2019 and 2020. March 2020 corresponded to the beginning of the lockdown in Germany. RESULTS: Overall, there was a decrease in the number of patients with at least one medication regimen change in the period 15 March to 31 July 2019 compared with 15 March to 31 July 2020 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors: -15%; sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors: -3%; glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists: 0%; other oral glucose-lowering drugs: -6%; and insulin: -21%). CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic had a strong impact on glucose-lowering drug use in T2DM patients in Germany. More research is warranted to further investigate the treatment and management of T2DM individuals during the COVID-19 era in Germany and elsewhere.","Jacob, Louis; Rickwood, Sarah; Rathmann, Wolfgang; Kostev, Karel",Diabetes obes. metab,142,20

At the moment, we are using the Reverse Transcription-PCR for diagnosis;but is this study completely reliable? CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 69-year-old man with multiple chronic comorbidities such as: hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, bronchial asthma and sleep apnea Patient complained of three days of cough, anorexia, generalized malaise, fever and chills prior to a sudden loss of consciousness episode in which he had a right side 8th rib fracture developing a small apical right sided pneumothorax Laboratory markers such as Ferritin, LDH, sed rate, CRP, D-dimer, lactic acid and procalcitonin, all of which have been associated with COVID-19, were elevated upon admission Chest CT scan demonstrated evidence of the small right apical pneumothorax and a focal consolidation of a left lung base In light of patient’s signs and symptoms, he was considered a person under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 A nasopharyngeal (NP) RT-PCR was done, yielding a negative test Patient continued developing fever episodes and worsening hypoxemia and his inflammatory markers continued on an increasing trend Chest CT scan was repeated and there was evidence of worsening, bilateral and bibasilar patchy ground glass opacities Another 2 NP RT-PCRs were done in light of high suspicion for COVID-19 pneumonia;both of them came back negative Was there any other etiology that we were missing? Patient was taken to bronchoscopy and the RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in BAL came back positive, despite 3 previous negative NP tests results DISCUSSION: RT-PCR is the most useful diagnostic test currently used for the detection of COVID-19 Mostly the nasopharyngeal test is done, mainly due to its simplicity There are multiple existing RT-PCR assays in the market along with several manufacturers [1,3] Among the different assays there are: RT-PCR assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2;being the most sensitive the RdRp (3) Yi Wei Tang et al recently published a study in which they developed three different RT-PCR assays and compared them to the currently existing and mostly used assay (RdRp) They discovered that the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was the most sensitive and specific of them and the one with less cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses CONCLUSIONS: This case brings a very important question, how reliable are the currently used RT-PCR tests regarding our Novel Coronavirus?

With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations around the world have struggled to adapt effectively to change, and healthcare organization have especially suffered through subjective responses. However, these methods have been proven ineffective by recent studies. This paper critically discusses the recent literature on the contribution of Healthcare Middle Managers as change agents in organizational change during cases of crisis and uncertainty. The results have shown that supporting Middle Managers in Healthcare is crucial for creating a sense of change to other immediate and relevant parties within the organization, while minimizing unnecessary costs and losses. Consequently, this paper contributes to clarifying the problem of not engaging the Middle Managers sufficiently with Healthcare owners and directors, and addresses the problem of disregarding Middle Managers as change agents. Thereby, the paper develops management knowledge, and it creates an opportunity for researchers to test this study on quantitative and qualitative methods in any population. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ahmed, N.; Hamdan, A.; Alareeni, B.",Lect.

Morphophysiological adaptations are necessary to allow the maintenance of migratory cycles and, therefore, studies with this focus can help clarify biological aspects related to migration. We analyzed the morphology variation in pectoral muscles and intestinal mucosa of Calidris pusilla, during different phases of the wintering period on the coast of Brazil. Fragments of pectoral muscles and duodenal were collected, fixed and processed for histology according to standard procedure, from specimens captured in a locality on the Brazilian coast. Modifications were found in the measured parameters among the three phases of wintering, arrival in Brazil (October, mid-period), January and departure to the Northern Hemisphere - May. The registered structural dynamism characterizes the growth of flight musculature and intestinal changes related to nutrition. Such changes occur temporarily due to the activities of preparation and migration between the northern and southern hemispheres.(AU)","Chaves, Felipe Q; Neri Júnior, Nailson A; Rodrigues, Roberta C; Araujo, Helder F.

Unfortunately, with COVID-19 pandemic, prescription only drugs are now increasingly being self-prescribed. Present study was therefore, conducted to generate data on self-medication practice with analgesics using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen, and the antibiotics among nursing students of University College Farasan Campus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among 177 study participants (20±3 years) between December 2019 to February 2020 using questionnaire. Data analyses were done using origin software (6.1, Illinois, USA). Significance was considered at P<0.05. Study was conducted in Department of Nursing, University College Farasan Province, a premier educational institute of Farasan Island affiliated to Jazan university, KSA. RESULTS: Self-medication practices were high among nursing students (n=154 participants, 87%). Acetaminophen was highest used drug for analgesic purposes without prescriptions (n=101 participants, 57%). Among NSAIDs, Ibuprofen was most preferred for various analgesic purposes (n=35 participants, 20%) followed by diclofenac (n=9 participants, 5%) and meloxicam (n=5 participants, 3%). Azithromycine was the only antibiotic used by participants (n=4 participant, 2%). Most common causes of self-medication were headache (45%), menstrual pain (23%) and fever (14%). Main reason for self-medications was lack of time to consult doctor (68%). Furthermore, self-medication was significantly associated with study year (P<0.003). CONCLUSION: Results give rise to concern for general well-being of future nursing workforce. There is need to implement educational actions and awareness programmes to limit self-medication practices among educated youth of this beautiful Island.","Faqihi, A H M A; Sayed, S F",Ann. pharm. fr,142,16

At the end of December 2020, Taiwan had recorded just 873 cases and 7 deaths, in a country of around 24 million people. How to determine the effectiveness of public health policies is an important issue that must be resolved, especially in those countries that have experienced few cases of community-transmitted COVID-19. Our analysis of epidemiological data in Taiwan relating to influenza-like illness (ILI), enterovirus and diarrhoea from the past 3 years reveals dramatic reductions in the incidence of ILI and enterovirus in 2020, compared with 2018 and 2019. These reductions occurred within 2 weeks of the government issuing public health policies for COVID-19 and indicate that such policies can effectively reduce infectious diseases overall. In contrast, no such reduction in ILI activity was observed in 2020 after the first COVID-19 case was reported in the USA. We suggest that infectious diseases data can be used to inform effective public health policies needed to break the transmission chain of COVID-19 and that ongoing monitoring of infectious diseases data can provide confidence about nationwide health.","MacDonald, Iona; Hsu, Jye-Lin",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),142,24

Toxicity analysis was also performed for the best hits, and the final complex structures for four complexes were subjected to 400 ns molecular dynamics simulations for stability testing. We found two natural origin inhibitors for the S protein: human ACE2 complex (Andrographolide and Pterostilbene) which displayed better inhibition potential for ACE2 receptor and its binding with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Comparative studies were also performed to test and verify that these two drug candidates are also better than hydroxychloroquine which is known to inhibit this complex.

METHODS: A longitudinal cohort analysis of Washington State Department of Health COVID-19 confirmed case age distribution 1) March-April 2020 (N = 13,934) and 2) March-August 2020 (N = 76,032) for proportional change over time using chi square tests for significance. RESULTS: From March 1st to April 19, 2020 COVID-19 age distribution shifted with a 10% decline in cases age 60 years and older and a 20% increase in age 0-19/20-39 years (chi-square = 223.10, p < .001). Number of cases over the initial analysis period were 0-19 years n = 515, 20-39 years n = 4078, 40-59 years n = 4788, 60-79 years n = 3221, 80+ years n = 1332. After the peak (March 22, 2020), incidence declined in older age groups and increased among age 0-19 and 20-39 age groups from 20% to 40% of total cases by April 19 and 50% by May 3. During this time testing expanded with more testing among older age groups and less testing among younger age groups while case positivity shifted young. Percent positive cases age 0-19/20-39 years through August 2020 increased to a consistent average of 60% [age 0-19 increased to 19% (N = 10257), age 20-39 increased to 42% (N = 30215)]. CONCLUSIONS: An increased sustained proportion of COVID-19 incidence is present among children (age 0-19) and young adults (age 20-39) indicating an elevated role in disease spread during the epidemic creating a possible reservoir of disease with spillover risk to more vulnerable older persons and those with comorbid conditions.

Essential and common neurological symptoms including gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions, myalgia, headache, altered mental status, confusion, delirium, and dizziness are presented separately in sections. Moreover, neurological manifestations and complications that are of great concern such as stroke, cerebral (sinus) venous thrombosis, seizures, meningoencephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Miller Fisher syndrome, acute myelitis, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) are also addressed systematically. Future studies that examine the impact of neurological symptoms and manifestations on the course of the disease are needed to further clarify and assess the link between neurological complications and the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19. To limit long-term consequences, it is crucial that healthcare professionals can early detect possible neurological symptoms and are well versed in the increasingly common neurological manifestations and complications of COVID-19.","Harapan, Biyan Nathanael; Yoo, Hyeon Joo",J. neurol,142,15

Little is known about how outpatient caregivers perceive their working conditions during the pandemic in Germany and about the difficulties they face. The aims of this study were (1) to examine specific job demands of outpatient caregivers in regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) to illuminate their job resources they can rely on and (3) to identify potential strain reactions they experience. Fifteen semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with outpatient caregivers working in Northern Germany in the period May-June 2020. Interviews were analyzed by using qualitative content analysis. Outpatient caregivers experienced daily mask obligation, lack of personal protection equipment (PPE) and stricter hygiene regulations as demanding during the pandemic. They also described a higher workload and emotional demands such as fear of infection or infecting others. They perceived team spirit and communication as important work-related resources. Depressive symptoms and feelings of stress were described as strain reactions. Outpatient care services need to be better prepared for sudden pandemic situations and provide their employees with sufficient PPE and education to reduce pandemic-related job demands leading to negative strain reactions.","Mojtahedzadeh, Natascha; Wirth, Tanja; Nienhaus, Albert; Harth, Volker; Mache, Stefanie",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),142,26

The array of injuries caused by this virus is broad and not limited to the respiratory system, but encompassing also extensive endothelial and systemic tissue damage. Since statins effectively improve endothelial function, these drugs may have beneficial effects in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, this investigation aimed to provide an updated overview on the interplay between statins and COVID-19, with particular focus on their potentially protective role against progression toward severe or critical illness and death. A systematic electronic search was performed in Scopus and PubMed up to present time. Data on statins use and COVID-19 outcomes especially in studies performed in Europe and North America were extracted and pooled. A total of seven studies met our inclusion criteria, totaling 2,398 patients (1,075 taking statins, i.e., 44.8%). Overall, statin usage in Western patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was associated with nearly 40% lower odds of progressing toward severe illness or death (odds ratio: 0.59; 95% confidence interval: 0.35-0.99). After excluding studies in which statin therapy was started during hospital admission, the beneficial effect of these drugs was magnified (odds ratio: 0.51; 95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.64). In conclusion, although randomized trials would be necessary to confirm these preliminary findings, current evidence would support a favorable effect of statins as adjuvant therapy in patients with COVID-19. Irrespective of these considerations, suspension of statin therapy seems highly unadvisable in COVID-19 patients.","Onorato, Diletta; Pucci, Mairi; Carpene, Giovanni; Henry, Brandon Michael; Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian; Lippi, Giuseppe",Semin. thromb. hemost,142,16

Recommendations from national and international health organizations suggest minimizing the use of flexible laryngoscopy as a result. Objective: To review evidence on the risks of aerosolization and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to health care personnel during endoscopy of the upper aerodigestive tract. Evidence Review: A comprehensive review of literature was performed on April 19, 2020, using the PubMed/MEDLINE (1966-April 2020), Embase (1975-April 2020), and Web of Science (1900-April 2020) databases. All English-language primary research studies were included if they assessed the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 during procedures in the upper aerodigestive tract. The primary outcome measure was disease transmission among health care workers. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for accuracy of reporting. Findings: The queries for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 identified 6 articles for systematic review. No studies included in this review provided data for SARS-CoV-2 transmission during flexible laryngoscopy. A total of 204 of 1264 health care workers (16.1%) had procedure-specific infections of SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2. Among those, 53 of 221 (24.0%) were exposed during intubation, 1 of 15 (6.7%) during bronchoscopy, and 1 of 1 (100%) during endoscopy-assisted intubation. Conclusions and Relevance: A substantial lack of research precludes formal conclusions about the safety of flexible laryngoscopy and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to health care workers. The use of appropriate precautionary measures and personal protective equipment appears to reduce the risk of transmission. Given the uncertainty in transmission and the known benefits of safety precautions, upper airway endoscopy may be reasonable to perform if precautionary steps are taken.","Kay, Josh K; Parsel, Sean M; Marsh, James J; McWhorter, Andrew J; Friedlander, Paul L",JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,142,16

METHODS: This is a population-based cohort study in England. The inclusion criteria were women with a recorded singleton birth between 29th May 2020 and 31st January 2021 in a national database of hospital admissions. Maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared between pregnant women with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection recorded in the birth episode and those without. Study outcomes were fetal death at or beyond 24 weeks' gestation (stillbirth), preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation), small for gestational age infant (SGA; birthweight <10th centile), preeclampsia/eclampsia, induction of labor, mode of birth, specialist neonatal care, composite neonatal adverse outcome indicator, maternal and neonatal length of hospital stay following birth (3 days or more), 28-day neonatal and 42-day maternal hospital readmission. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection status and outcomes were calculated using logistic regression, adjusting for maternal age, ethnicity, parity, pre-existing diabetes, pre-existing hypertension and socioeconomic deprivation measured using Index of Multiple Deprivation 2019. Models were fitted with robust standard errors to account for hospital-level clustering. The analysis of the neonatal outcomes was repeated for those born at term (&#8805; 37 weeks' gestation) since preterm birth has been reported to be more common in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The analysis included 342,080 women, of whom 3,527 had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was more common in women who were younger, of non-white ethnicity, primiparous, residing in the most deprived areas, or had comorbidities. Fetal death (aOR, 2.21, 95% CI 1.58-3.11; P<0.001) and preterm birth (aOR 2.17, 95% CI 1.96-2.42; P<0.001) occurred more frequently in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection than those without. Risk of preeclampsia/eclampsia (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.29-1.85; P<0.001), birth by emergency Cesarean delivery (aOR 1.63, 95% CI 1.51-1.76; P<0.001) and prolonged admission following birth (aOR 1.57, 95%CI 1.44-1.72; P<0.001) were significantly higher for women with SARS-CoV-2 infection than those without. There were no significant differences in the rate of other maternal outcomes. Risk of neonatal adverse outcome (aOR 1.45, 95% CI 1.27-1.66; P<0.001), need for specialist neonatal care (aOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.51; P=0.03), and prolonged neonatal admission following birth (aOR 1.61, 95% CI 1.49-1.75; P<0.001) were all significantly higher for infants with mothers with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. When the analysis was restricted to pregnancies delivered at term (&#8805;37 weeks), there were no significant differences in neonatal adverse outcome (P=0.78), need for specialist neonatal care after birth (P=0.22) or neonatal readmission within four weeks of birth (P=0.05). Neonates born at term to mothers with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were more likely to have prolonged admission following birth (21.1% compared to 14.6%, aOR 1.61, 95% CI 1.49-1.75; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of birth is associated with higher rates of fetal death, preterm birth, preeclampsia and emergency Cesarean delivery. There were no additional adverse neonatal outcomes, other than those related to preterm delivery. Pregnant women should be counseled regarding risks of SARS-COV-2 infection and should be considered a priority for vaccination.","Gurol-Urganci, Ipek; Jardine, Jennifer E; Carroll, Fran; Draycott, Tim; Dunn, George; Fremeaux, Alissa; Harris, Tina; Hawdon, Jane; Morris, Edward; Muller, Patrick; Waite, Lara; Webster, Kirstin; VAN DER Meulen, Jan; Khalil, Asma",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,142,1

Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale-Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P < .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P < .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.","Lai, Jianbo; Ma, Simeng; Wang, Ying; Cai, Zhongxiang; Hu, Jianbo; Wei, Ning; Wu, Jiang; Du, Hui; Chen, Tingting; Li, Ruiting; Tan, Huawei; Kang, Lijun; Yao, Lihua; Huang, Manli; Wang, Huafen; Wang, Gaohua; Liu, Zhongchun; Hu, Shaohua",JAMA Netw Open,142,2

INTRODUCTION: The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has catalized several changes in many fields of our lives, and also at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Debrecen, Hungary. OBJECTIVES: We wanted to analyse the compound effect of our new local protocols regarding elective labour inductions at term, the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting infection control measures, the merging of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Ward of the Kenézy County Hospital of Debrecen and the University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and also the change of the legal environment. METHODS: Local protocols were introduced: 1. Labour induction. 2. Cervical ripening in labour induction. 3. Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean. 4. Management of pregnancy around term in the case of planned trial of labour after cesarean. We compared the obstetrical data (number of deliveries, cesarean section rate, perinatal outcome and the rate and success rate of labour inductions) before and after the implementation of the protocols. The results were also compared to the Hungarian national database. RESULTS: The annual cesarean rate at our department dropped to 33.5% in 2020. In the first 9-month period, after the introduction of the new reforms, the cesarean rate decreased to 30.7%, whereas the Hungarian national rate was 40.3% in 2020. At our department, 20% of all the deliveries were induced and 74% of them led to vaginal deliveries in 2020, while in 2019 only 11% of deliveries were labour inductions, and 47% of these cases were vaginal deliveries. The monthly number of deliveries was rising constantly between January 2020 (250 deliveries) and January 2021 (450 deliveries), and the monthly cesarean rate decreased from 41% to 25%. Comparing the data of 2019 and 2020, the annual perinatal mortality rate dropped from 6.3 in 2019 to 4.2 in 2020. Neonatal morbidity, as measured by admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit, also decreased (14.8% in 2019 and 13.5% in 2020). CONCLUSIONS: As a compound result of the described factors, but mainly due to the new protocols, both the rate and the success rate of labour inductions increased significantly, while the cesarean rate decreased with improving perinatal mortality and morbidity.

In order to address these issues, a specialist team was established with the aim of designing and implementing a Curriculum Map (CM), which have been recognised in their ability to provide a centralised, visual representation of the curriculum. While multiple perspectives from educators to stakeholders can be considered here, the need for the CM to remain student centred was identified as key at UCLMS. The aim of this study was therefore to understand the requirements of the CM prior to production from the perspective of the medical students. METHODS: A mixed-methods sequential study was conducted. The first stage involved gathering quantitative data using a primary online survey. This used 15 questions, rated by Likert scales and focussed around three domains: depiction of content, functionality and students' likely engagement with a CM. There was a free-text question for additional comments. The second stage consisted of multiple student focus groups representing different years of the programme, conducted by trained facilitators following a predetermined scheme. Reflective Thematic Analysis (RTA) was used to synthesise the qualitative data, which was read independently by two researchers. All students at UCLMS were invited to participate in the study. RESULTS: There were 409 survey responses. 92% of students said they were 'likely' or 'very likely' to use a CM, with their key intended use being to monitor their learning progress and ensure preparedness for assessments. Five key themes emerged from the focus groups, namely that students wanted a CM to be: comprehensive; simple and intuitive; able to link content throughout the course; aligned with assessment; and useful to monitor students' progress. CONCLUSIONS: Through this study, valuable insight was gained on students' ideal preferences for the CM. Understanding this was important in order to ensure that its co-design remained student-centred prior to its design and launch. This study also highlighted the need to set realistic expectations for students on the role of a CM in preparing them for assessments, and ultimately professional practice.","Chakrabarti, Rima; Wardle, Katie; Wright, Tor; Bennie, Taylor; Gishen, Faye",BMC Med Educ,142,16

Population have a susceptibility to COVID-19, older people were more susceptible to have a variety diseases than younger, including COVID-19 infection with no doubt. This study focused on older patients with COVID-19 infection and analyzed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of them. METHODS: We collected information on confirmed older patient transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service (EMS) to the designated hospitals from Jan 20 to Feb 29, 2020. The information including demographic, epidemiological, clinical, classification of severity and outcomes. All cases were categorized into three groups and compared the difference between aged 50-64 years, 65-79 years and older than 80 years. RESULTS: 56.7 % of elderly confirmed patients were male, fever (78.3 %), cough (56.7 %), dyspnea (30.0 %), and fatigue (23.3 %) were common symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Classification of severity has statistically significant differences between the three groups, compared with middle-aged patients and aged 65-79 years group, older than 80 years group had significant statistical differences in contacted to symptomatic case in 14 days. As of Feb 29, 38.3 % patients had discharged and 53.3 % patients remained in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in elderly was 8.3 %. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 infection is generally susceptible with a relatively high fatality rate in older patients, we should pay more attention to the elderly patients with COVID-19 infection.","Niu, Shengmei; Tian, Sijia; Lou, Jing; Kang, Xuqin; Zhang, Luxi; Lian, Huixin; Zhang, Jinjun",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,142,21

These contaminants are discharged mainly from industrial wastes, agricultural and household activities and domestic sewage. A total of 12 stations (2.5 to 3.5 km apart from each other) were selected for the study, covering the upstream and downstream areas of river Yamuna in Delhi. The investigated sites were evaluated for significant difference between upstream and downstream locations of river Yamuna in three different time periods (June, October, February). Metal contamination were measured in water, sediments (2 µm) and nearby agriculture soil of the river Yamuna, and found with high metal loads as compared with the international standards, chiefly in the downstream sites as the river flows through the Delhi stretch. The multivariate statistical analysis revealed spatial and temporal variations in the metal concentrations which suggest seasonal variation and common point source of some metals while different sources of other metals. The contamination of the river water and adjoining agriculture soils points towards possible entry of these metals into the food chain. The study indicates that considering the current status of metal pollution, the surface water is not in good conditions for use as drinking purpose because of the high concentrations of few potentially toxic metals. Our study recommends regular monitoring of toxic metals in Yamuna river water and sediments, strict ban on the domestic, agriculture and industrial waste disposal for the restoration of the river to its natural state.","Parmar, Shobhika; Sharma, Vijay K; Singh, Vir; Kharwar, Ravindra N",Environ Monit Assess,142,16

Many clinics reopened but required universal SARS-CoV-2 screening. However, the rate of positive results and the necessity for such testing is unknown. We report here on early results from asingle-center academic NewYork fertility practice utilizing universal SARS-CoV-2 screening. This mixed prospective retrospective cohort included 164 patients who underwent at least one SARS-CoV-2 screening test for fertility treatment between May and July2020. Patients completed 1 to 3 nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 tests per cycle and remained symptom-free to continue fertility treatments. SARS-CoV-2 test results, past results, history of Covid-19 infection, and patient/cycle characteristics were recorded and tabulated through October2020. Outcomes included positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests, rate of prior Covid-19 infections, and clinical courses of patients testing positive. Patients underwent 263 cycles entailing 460 total SARS-CoV-2 screening tests. Fifteen patients reported astrong prior clinical history of Covid-19. Six patients experienced apositive SARS-CoV-2 test (2.3% of all cycles). Among 77 cycles (n = 58 patients) entailing one SARS-CoV-2 test, 2 cases (2.6%) were noted. Among 173 cycles (n = 121 patients) entailing two SARS-CoV-2 tests, 4 cycles (2.3%) were noted. Zero (0%) of 13 cycles (n = 13 patients) entailing 3 SARS-CoV-2 tests were positive. All patients were cleared to resume treatment within one month. Overall, anew asymptomatic infection was identified in 2 cycles (0.8%), while 4 of the 6 positive SARS-CoV-2 tests were among patients with aprior history of Covid-19. 3 of 4 also had adocumented prior positive RNA test. Our data suggest that universal SARS-CoV-2 screening among fertility patients is feasible, with an approximately 2% positive rate per cycle among the patients of this study. Most positive patients had aprior remote infection, but their infectiousness while being screened remains unclear.Abbreviations: REI: reproductive endocrinology and infertility; IUI: intrauterine insemination; IVF: in vitro fertilization; sono: sonography; cryo: cryopreservation; FET: frozen embryo transfer.","Gingold, Julian A; Galperin, Sharon; Fowler, Sabrina; Kappy, Michelle; Pollack, Staci; Singh, Manvinder; Lieman, Harry; Jindal, Sangita",Syst Biol Reprod Med,142,8

METHODS: Between December 31, 2019 and March 7, 2020, 23 hospitalized pregnant patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Clinical presentations were collected retrospectively from records, including laboratory testing, chest CT imaging, and symptoms. Descriptive analysis and correlation of patients' clinical and CT characteristics were performed. Laboratory results from time of first admission and CT absorption (defined as reduction in lesion area, decrease in density, and absorption of some solid components) were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. RESULTS: Fifteen (65.2%) patients were asymptomatic with patchy ground-glass opacity in a single lung lobe. Eight (34.8%) patients were symptomatic with multiple patchy ground-glass shadows, consolidation, and fibrous stripes. Differences in lymphocyte percentage and neutrophil granulocyte rate between first admission and CT absorption were significant (P<0.001). Median absorption time was shorter in the asymptomatic group compared with the symptomatic group (5 vs 10 days; P<0.001). Median hospitalization time between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients was 14 vs 25.5 days; P>0.001. Median absorption time and length of hospitalization for all patients was 6 days (IQR 5-8) and 17 days (IQR 13-25), respectively. CONCLUSION: Radiological findings and clinical characteristics in pregnant women with COVID-19 were similar to those of non-pregnant women with COVID-19. Median absorption time and length of hospitalization in asymptomatic patients were significantly shorter than in symptomatic patients.

Whilst people's well-being can lead to economic growth, it can also have the opposite effect if overlooked. Therefore, enhancing subjective well-being (SWB) is pertinent for all organisations for the sustainable development of an economy. While health conditions were previously deemed the most reliable predictors, the availability of data on people's personal lifestyles now offers a new dimension into well-being for organisations. Using open data available from the national Annual Population Survey in the UK, which measures SWB, this research uncovered that among several independent variables to predict varying levels of people's perceived well-being, long-term health conditions, one's marital status, and age played a key role in SWB. The proposed model provides the key indicators of measuring SWB for organisations using big data.","Weerakkody, Vishanth; Sivarajah, Uthayasankar; Mahroof, Kamran; Maruyama, Takao; Lu, Shan",,142,16

Donors use a variety of partnerships with the private sector to realise development objectives. We use the term donor-private partnerships (DPPs) to describe the broad range of arrangements between donors and private-sector actors. Using ODA to leverage private finance, innovation testing, or service delivery, modalities include blended finance, de-risking instruments, public-private partnerships, and more. Does the reality match donors’ enthusiastic rhetoric? There are success stories but civil society actors and others question whether private-sector engagement in development reduces poverty and inequality, advances gender justice, and achieves environmental sustainability. There may be trade-offs between development and profit making. We present our research based on frameworks we developed to categorise and assess DPPs. We applied these to 20 partnerships involving nine donors and found that donors fail to sufficiently integrate development, human rights, and environmental standards. They inconsistently implement due diligence and risk management requirements, and impact assessments are inadequate. Our frameworks offer practitioners and academics valuable tools to examine how DPPs can advance sustainable development. © 2021 The Author(s).

Existing health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) measurement tools do not account for these differences. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a culturally specific parent-proxy HR-QoL measurement tool for First Nations children. DESIGN: Scale development was informed by parents/carers of children with a chronic illness and an expert panel. The preliminary 39-item survey was reviewed (n=12) and tested (n=163) with parents/carers of First Nations children aged 0-12 years at baseline with comparative scales: the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, generic HR-QoL (Paediatric QoL Inventory 4.0, PedsQL4.0) and Spence Children's Anxiety Scale, and repeated (n=46) 4 weeks later. Exploratory Factor Analysis was used for scale reduction. Reliability and validity were assessed by internal consistency, test-retest, and correlations with comparison scales. RESULTS: Items within our First Nations-Child Quality of Life (FirstNations-CQoL) were internally consistent with Cronbach's alpha coefficients of &#8805;0.7 (quality of life, 0.808; patient experience, 0.880; patient support, 0.768) and overall test-retest reliability was good (r=0.75; 95% CI 0.593 to 0.856). Convergent validity was observed with the PedsQL4.0 with Pearson's coefficients of r=0.681 (ages 2-4 years); r=0.651 (ages 5-12 years) and with the Kessler Psychological Distress scale (r=-0.513). Divergent validity against the Spence Anxiety Scale was not demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: The FirstNations-CQoL scale was accepted by the participants, reliable and demonstrated convergent validity with comparison measures. This tool requires further evaluation to determine responsiveness, its minimal important difference and clinical utility.","Butten, Kaley; Jones, Lee; Newcombe, Peter A; Chang, Anne B; Sheffield, Jeanie K; O039,; Grady, Kerry-Ann F; Johnson, Newell W; Bell, Anna Maria; Ross, Greggory; Toombs, Maree",BMJ Open,142,16

Faced up with the unprecedented nature of this situation, the liberal psychotherapist is led to rethink some aspects of the framework of his practice in order to preserve the thread of the transferential relationship. The authors develop a clinical reflection on the clinical setting in a pandemic period by exploring in particular the dynamics of telephone sessions. For telephone interviews, the question of the sound envelope is central, in particular regarding the psychic function of silence. We choose to illustrate our point with short vignettes than by relying on long-term clinical cases, more likely to represent the variety of new clinical situations encountered and the questions that accompany them. This article introduces his point by recounting the plague epidemic in ancient Greece to show the impact of the environment on humans and its collective fantasy implications. Being faced up with death, contamination, the invisible enemy brings out a palpable concern. It is indeed quite remarkable that these same reactions and concerns in front of death caused by the pandemic match whith what is related by Thucydides who survived the plague, which affected Athens during the Peloponnesian War. In another context, Winnicott highlights the place and importance of the therapeutic environment. It is both a question of adjusting the framework according to the context while maintaining certain intangible aspects representing the permanence of the link and its framework. A framework cannot exist without being kept, which is equivalent to thinking of the framework above all as an internal framework, questioning the clinician about what he values and what he makes sense in his practice. In the current context, these questions arise from the perspective of a certain flexibility, depending on the human context (child, adolescent, consultations, etc.) or external context (crisis linked to a virus, etc.) showing that it is more than never question of exercising on a case-by-case basis, taking into account changes in the environment. The initial observation during this period of confinement concerns the fact that some patients contact a therapist for the first time by telephone and wish to initiate psychotherapy (during this period) when they explain that such an initiative was not possible. despite the difficulties already encountered in the past. But there is also the opposite case: patients who have no intention of continuing the work already started during this time. Thus, faced up with the injunction of confinement, they show themselves in the psychic impossibility of following the treatment by other means such as, for example, telephone sessions. In this perspective, the silence on the phone takes on a different tone; silence reveals itself to be a source of greater anxiety than in presence: the presence of bodies, of its movements perceptible as imperceptible, of a gesture that carries or accompanies the senses, breathing, the visual context of the office and of its ""decor"", represent as many essential elements in the usual capacity of the frame; in the absence of these basic sensory elements, silence can be experienced as a void, or even a gap in the bond, opening Pandora's box of paranoid fantasies acting unconsciously. If silence is representative of the whole framework, it promotes in this context the partialization of the clinician's body reduced to one ear and not to a whole body. Here, it is the change of framework that mobilizes the difference, established by Mr. Klein, between the partial and total object; this circumstance neo-framework could therefore call for regressive movements, undoing the silence of its symbolic function when the bodies are present.","Houssier, Florian; Christaki, Angélique; Vlachopoulou, Xanthie",Ann. med.-psychol,142,16

Sponsors or delegated organisations responsible for monitoring trials have needed to consider and implement alternative ways of working due to the national infection risk necessitating restricted movement of staff and public, reduced clinical staff resource as research staff moved to clinical areas, and amended working arrangements for sponsor and sponsor delegates as staff moved to working from home.Organisations have often worked in isolation to fast track mitigations required for the conduct of clinical trials during the pandemic; this paper describes many of the learnings from a group of monitoring leads based in United Kingdom Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC) Clinical Trials Unit (CTUs) within the UK.The UKCRC Monitoring Task and Finish Group, comprising monitoring leads from 9 CTUs, met repeatedly to identify how COVID-19 had affected clinical trial monitoring. Informed consent is included as a specific issue within this paper, as review of completed consent documentation is often required within trial monitoring plans (TMPs). Monitoring is defined as involving on-site monitoring, central monitoring or/and remote monitoring.Monitoring, required to protect the safety of the patients and the integrity of the trial and ensure the protocol is followed, is often best done by a combination of central, remote and on-site monitoring. However, if on-site monitoring is not possible, workable solutions can be found using only central or central and remote monitoring. eConsent, consent by a third person, or via remote means is plausible. Minimising datasets to the critical data reduces workload for sites and CTU staff. Home working caused by COVID-19 has made electronic trial master files (TMFs) more inviting. Allowing sites to book and attend protocol training at a time convenient to them has been successful and worth pursuing for trials with many sites in the future.The arrival of COVID-19 in the UK has forced consideration of and changes to how clinical trials are conducted in relation to monitoring. Some developed practices will be useful in other pandemics and others should be incorporated into regular use.","Love, Sharon B; Armstrong, Emma; Bayliss, Carrie; Boulter, Melanie; Fox, Lisa; Grumett, Joanne; Rafferty, Patricia; Temesi, Barbara; Wills, Krista; Corkhill, Andrea",Trials,142,22

The aim of this project is to capture the effect of COVID-19 on the volume of surgery and adaptations to the surgical care of patients at a breast centre in BC. METHODS: All proven or suspected breast cancer cases treated with surgery between March 16, 2019 and April 30, 2019 and March 16, 2020 and April 30, 2020 through the Providence Breast Centre were included in this review. The date ranges in 2020 mark the early COVID-19 pandemic period in BC and the large shift in operating room access during this time. RESULTS: In 2019, 99 patients underwent surgery for proven breast cancer and 30 patients for suspected breast cancer. In 2020, 162 patients underwent surgery for breast cancer and 34 for suspected breast cancer. Wait times from core biopsy to surgery and surgery to oncology consultation were improved in 2020 with a reduction of core biopsy to surgery time from 58 to 28 days for patients seen during the pandemic. There was an increased use of regional anesthesia and same day discharge compared to 2019 with increases in regional anesthesia (41%-89%) and same day discharge (64%-86%) after adaptations to the pandemic were implemented. CONCLUSIONS: Changes such as improved access to telemedicine, timing for cancer surgeries, and safer anesthetic techniques in response to the pandemic will change breast cancer surgical care beyond the pandemic era.

Thus, this study aimed to determine the epidemic trend and prediction of COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: This was a secondary data analysis and modeling study. The daily reports of definitive COVID-19 patients released by Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education were used in this study. Epidemic projection models of Gompertz, von Bertalanffy, and least squared error (LSE) with percentage error were used to predict the number of hospitalization cases from April 3, 2020 until May 13, 2020. Results: The prediction of the number of patients on April 3, 2020 by von Bertalanffy, Gompertz, and LSE, with 95% confidence interval (CI), were estimated at 44 200 (39 208-53 809), 47 500 (38 907-52 640), and 48 000 (40 000-57 560), respectively. The number of deceased COVID-19 patients was also estimated to be 3100 (2633-3717) individuals by the von Bertalanffy model, 3700 (2900-4310) by Gompertz's model, and 3850 (3200-4580) by LSE. Making predictions about the flat epidemic curve and number of patients based on Gompertz model, will project 67 000 (61 500-87 000) cases. Based on Gompertz and von models, 7900 (6200-9300) and 4620 (3930-5550) deaths will occur from May 13 to June 1, 2020, respectively, and then the curve will flatten. Conclusion: In this study, estimations were made based on severely ill patients who were in need of hospitalization.

Méthode: Etude prospective multicentrique menée dans 3 services universitaires de gynécologie obstétrique (Hospices Civils de Lyon, France) durant la période de confinement (16 mars au 11 mai 2020). Toutes les patientes présentant un cancer du sein non métastatique ou un cancer gynécologique ont été inclues. Les traitements prévus, réellement réalisés, reportés, les délais du report et les modifications organisationnelles (RCP, téléconsultations) ont été étudiés. Résultats: 205 patientes consécutives ont été inclues, âge moyen de 60,5 +-1,0. Sept patientes (3,4%) ont présenté une infection au SARS-CoV-2, dont 2 sont décédées. Le traitement prévu a été maintenu pour 122 patientes (59,5%), reporté pour 72 patientes (35,1%), annulé pour 11 patientes (5,4%). Parmi les 115 interventions chirurgicales prévues, 40 (34.8%) ont été reportées, 7 annulées (6,1%) et 9 patientes (7,8%) ont eu une modification du geste chirurgical. Parmi les 59 (28,8%) traitements par radiothérapie prévus, 24 (40,7%) reportée et 2 (3,4%) annulés. Parmi les 56 (27,3%) traitements par chimiothérapie prévus, 8 (14,3%) ont été reportés et 2 (3,6%) annulés. Les dossiers de 145 patientes (70,7%) ont été discutées en RCP. Cent cinquante-huit patientes (77%) ont bénéficié d’un système de téléconsultation. Conclusion: Notre étude a permis d’évaluer l’impact de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur la prise en charge thérapeutique des patientes atteintes de cancers gynécologiques durant la période de confinement. Cela améliorera notre prise en charge en cas de rebond épidémique ou de crise sanitaire future. Objective: The exceptional health situation related to the SARS-Cov2 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) required a deep and very quickly adaptation of management practices in gynecological cancer. The main objective is to estimate the proportion of patients with treatment modifications. Method: This is a multicenter prospective study conducted in 3 university gynecological cancer departments (HCLyon, France) during the period of confinement (march 16 to may 11, 2020). All patients with non-metastatic breast cancer or gynecological cancer were included. The planned treatment, postponement, delay and organizational modifications (RCP, teleconsultations) were studied. Results: 205 consecutive patients were included, average age 60.5 +- 1.0. 7 patients (3.4%) had SARS-Cov-2 infection, 2 patients died. 122 patients (59.5%) had a treatment maintained, 72 patients (35.1%) postponed, 11 patients (5.4%) cancelled. Of the 115 (56.1%) planned surgeries, 40 (34.8%) postponed, 7 cancelled (6.1%). 9 patients (7.8%) had a surgical modification. Of the 59 (28.8%) radiotherapy treatments scheduled, 24 (40.7%) postponed and 2 (3.4%) cancelled. Of the 56 (27.3%) chemotherapy treatment planned, 8 (14.3%) postponed and 2 (3.6%) cancelled. 145 patientes (70.7%) have been discussed in multidisciplinary meeting. One hundred and fifty-eight patients (77%) had a teleconsultation system. Conclusion: Our study assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on therapeutic management of patients with gynecological cancer during the period of confinement. This will probably improve our management of an eventual epidemic rebound or future health crisis.","Lamblin, G; Golfier, F; Peron, J; Moret, S; Chene, G; Nohuz, E; Lebon, M; Dubernard, G; Cortet, M",Gynecol Obstet Fertil Senol,142,26

Our study is the first to analyze the characteristics of HBoV-positive samples from ARTI patients with a wide age distribution from Guangzhou, southern China. METHODS: Throat swabs (n=2811) were collected and analyzed from children and adults with ARTI over a 13-month period. The HBoV complete genome from a 60 year-old female patient isolate was also determined. RESULTS: HBoV DNA was detected in 65/2811 (2.3%) samples, of which 61/1797 were from children (<18 years old) and 4/1014 from adults (≥18 years old). Seasonal peaks of 4.8% and 7.7% were detected in May and June, respectively. 28 of 65 (43.1%) HBoV-positive samples were co-detected with 11/16 other potential pathogens. Mycoplasma pneumoniae had the highest frequency of 16.9% (11/65). Upper and lower respiratory tract illness were common symptoms, with 19/65 (29.2%) patients diagnosed with pneumonia by chest radiography. All four adult patients had systemic influenza-like symptoms. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome revealed a close relationship with other HBoVs, and a more distant relationship with HBoV2 and HBoV3. CONCLUSIONS: HBoV was detected from children and adults with ARTI from Guangzhou, southern China. Elderly people were also susceptive to HBoV. A single lineage of HBoV was detected among a wide age distribution of patients with ARTI.","Liu, Wen-Kuan; Chen, De-Hui; Liu, Qian; Liang, Huan-Xi; Yang, Zi-Feng; Qin, Sheng; Zhou, Rong",BMC Infect Dis,142,16

The analysis of the structural and energetic effects of mutations on protein-protein interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or neutralizing monoclonal antibodies will be beneficial for epidemic surveillance, diagnosis, and optimization of neutralizing agents. According to the molecular dynamics simulation, a key mutation N439K in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD region created a new salt bridge with Glu329 of hACE2, which resulted in greater electrostatic complementarity, and created a weak salt bridge with Asp442 of RBD. Furthermore, the N439K-mutated RBD bound hACE2 with a higher affinity than wild-type, which may lead to more infectious. In addition, the N439K-mutated RBD was markedly resistant to the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody REGN10987, which may lead to the failure of neutralization. The results show consistent with the previous experimental conclusion and clarify the structural mechanism under affinity changes. Our methods will offer guidance on the assessment of the infection efficiency and antigenicity effect of continuing mutations in SARS-CoV-2.","Zhou, Wenyang; Xu, Chang; Wang, Pingping; Luo, Meng; Xu, Zhaochun; Cheng, Rui; Jin, Xiyun; Guo, Yu; Xue, Guangfu; Juan, Liran; Anashkina, Anastasia A.; Nie, Huan; Jiang, Qinghua",Front Cell Dev Biol,142,1

MATERIALS & METHODS: In a COVID-19 ICU-patient, the tongue became grotesquely swollen, hardened and protruding from the oral cavity after 20 h of mechanical ventilation uninterrupted in the prone position. To assess the doubtful viability of the tongue, pulse-oximetric hemoglobin O(2)-saturation (SpO(2); Nellcor, OxiMax MAX-NI, Covidien, MA, USA) and NIRS-based, regional tissue O(2)-saturation measurements (rSO(2); SenSmart, Nonin, MN, USA) were performed at the tongue. RESULTS: At the tongue, regular pulse-oximetric waveforms with a pulse-oximetric hemoglobin O(2)-saturation (SpO(2)) of 88% were recorded, i.e. only slightly lower than the SpO(2) reading at the extremities at that time (90%). Lingual NIRS-based rSO(2) measurements yielded stable tissue rSO(2)-values of 76-78%, i.e. values expected also in other adequately perfused and oxygenated (muscle-) tissues. CONCLUSION: Despite the alarming, clinical finding of a grotesquely swollen, rubber-hard tongue and clinical concerns on the adequacy of the tongue perfusion and oxygenation, our measurements of both arterial pulsatility (SpO(2)) and NIRS-based tissue oxygenation (rSO(2)) suggested adequate perfusion and oxygenation of the tongue, rendering non-vitality of the tongue, e.g. by lingual venous thrombosis, unlikely.

The aim of this study is to assess the significance of systemic inflammatory biomarkers, such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), the ratio of C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR), the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and the modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGps) in the diagnosis and prognosis of malignant intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas. Data were obtained from a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent pancreatic resection for IPMNs from January 2005 to December 2015. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, considering preoperative inflammatory biomarkers, clinicopathological variables, and imaging features. Eighty-three patients with histologically proven IPMNs of the pancreas were included in the study, 37 cases of low-grade or intermediate dysplasia and 46 cases of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or invasive carcinoma. Univariate analysis showed that obstructive jaundice (p = 0.02) and a CAR of >0.083 (p = 0.001) were predictors of malignancy. On multivariate analysis, only the CAR was a statistically significant independent predictor of HGD or invasive carcinoma in pancreatic IPMNs, identifying a subgroup of patients with a poor prognosis. Combining the CAR with patients’ imaging findings, clinical features and tumor markers can be useful in the clinical management of IPMNs. Their value should be tested in prospective studies.","Serafini, Simone; Friziero, Alberto; Sperti, Cosimo; Vallese, Lorenzo; Grego, Andrea; Piangerelli, Alfredo; Belluzzi, Amanda; Moletta, Lucia",J Clin Med,142,20

The measures to contain infection taken by many governments have been extremely severe by imposing home lockdown and industrial production shutdown, making this the biggest crisis since the second world war. Additionally, the continuous colonization of wild natural lands may touch unknown virus reservoirs, causing the spread of epidemics. Apart from SARS-Cov-2, the recent history has seen the spread of several viral pandemics such as H2N2 and H3N3 flu, HIV, and SARS, while MERS and Ebola viruses are considered still in a prepandemic phase. Hard nanomaterials (HNMs) have been recently used as antimicrobial agents, potentially being next-generation drugs to fight viral infections. HNMs can block infection at early (disinfection, entrance inhibition) and middle (inside the host cells) stages and are also able to mitigate the immune response. This review is focused on the application of HNMs as antiviral agents. In particular, mechanisms of actions, biological outputs, and limitations for each HNM will be systematically presented and analyzed from a material chemistry point-of-view. The antiviral activity will be discussed in the context of the different pandemic viruses. We acknowledge that HNM antiviral research is still at its early stage, however, we believe that this field will rapidly blossom in the next period.","Reina, Giacomo; Peng, Shiyuan; Jacquemin, Lucas; Andrade, Andrés Felipe; Bianco, Alberto",ACS Nano,142,29

We aimed to compare legal measures and governance established for managing COVID-19 infection risks at workplaces in nine Asia and Pacific countries and to recommend key administrative measures. METHODS: We collected information on legal measures and governance both general citizens and workers regarding infection risks such as COVID-19 from industrial hygiene professionals in nine countries (Indonesia, India, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Republic of the Philippines, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand) using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: A governmental body overseeing public health and welfare was in charge of containing the spread and occurrence of infectious diseases under an infectious disease control and prevention act or another special act, although the name of the pertinent organizations and legislation vary among countries. Unlike in the case of other traditional hazards, there have been no specific articles or clauses describing the means of mitigating virus risk in the workplace that are legally required of employers, making it difficult to define the responsibilities of the employer. Each country maintains own legal systems regarding access to the duration, administration, and financing of paid sick leave. Many workers may not have access to paid sick leave even if it is legally guaranteed. CONCLUSION: Specific legal measures to manage infectious disease risks, such as providing proper personal protective equipment, education, engineering control measures, and paid sick leave are recommended to be stipulated in occupational safety and health related acts.","Derek, Miller; Tsai, Feng-Jen; Kim, Jiwon; Tejamaya, Mila; Putri, Vilandi; Muto, Go; Reginald, Alex; Phanprasit, Wantanee; Granadillos, Nelia; Zainal Farid, Marina Bt; Capule, Carmela Q.; Lin, Yu-Wen; Park, Jihoon; Chen, Ruey-Yu; Lee, Kyong Hui; Park, Jeongim; Hashimoto, Haruo; Yoon, Chungsik; Padungtod, Chantana; Park, Dong-Uk",Saf Health Work,142,8

Generally, total antibody bridging assays combine good sensitivity with high selectivity. Therefore, we developed sensitive total antibody bridging assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NP), in addition to conventional isotype-specific assays. Antibody kinetics was assessed in PCR-confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n=41) and three populations of patients with COVID-19 symptoms not requiring hospital admission: PCR-confirmed convalescent plasmapheresis donors (n=182), PCR-confirmed hospital care workers (n=47), and a group of longitudinally sampled symptomatic individuals highly suspect of COVID-19 (n=14). In non-hospitalized patients, the antibody response to RBD is weaker but follows similar kinetics as has been observed in hospitalized patients. Across populations, the RBD bridging assay identified most patients correctly as seropositive. In 11/14 of the COVID-19-suspect cases, seroconversion in the RBD bridging assay could be demonstrated before day 12; NP antibodies emerged less consistently. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility of finger prick sampling for antibody detection against SARS-CoV-2 using these assays. In conclusion, the developed bridging assays reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, and are therefore well-suited to conduct seroprevalence studies.","Vogelzang, E.

The objective of this paper is to focus on the spatial heterogeneity in the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and to contribute to an understanding of the channels by which it spread, focusing on the regional socioeconomic dimension. For this, we use a dataset covering 125 European regions in 12 countries. Considering that the impact of the COVID-19 crisis differed sharply not only across countries but also across regions within the same country, the empirical strategy is based, on the one hand, on an exploratory analysis of spatial autocorrelations, which makes it possible to identify regional clusters of the disease. On the other hand, we use spatial regression models to capture the diffusion effect and the role of different families of regional factors in this process. We find that the share of older people in the population, GDP per capita, distance from achieving EU objectives, and the unemployment rate are correlated with high COVID-19 death rates. In contrast, the number of medical practitioners and hospital beds and the level of social trust are correlated with low COVID-19 death rates.","Amdaoud, Mounir; Arcuri, Giuseppe; Levratto, Nadine",Eur J Health Econ,142,1

To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-α and IFN-γ in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-α and γ were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.","Zhang, Xiao-Nan; Liu, Jiang-Xia; Hu, Yun-Wen; Chen, Hui; Yuan, Zheng-Hong",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Structure and Expression,142,17

A baseline audit carried out on an acute stroke ward at a District General Hospital in East Kent showed variability in blood tests being requested on admission for patients who had a suspected stroke, in particular serum glucose and cholesterol levels. Our aim was to ensure that at least 80% of patients admitted to the stroke ward with a suspected stroke had blood glucose and cholesterol levels measured on admission, over an 18-week period. The percentage of patients admitted with a suspected stroke on the ward who had the appropriate investigations requested on admission was measured weekly. Quality improvement methodology was used to formulate three interventions in the form of Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles: (1) an educational email sent to doctors regarding the assessment of patients who had a stroke and admission blood tests required; (2) adaptation of the ‘Stroke Admission Clerking Proforma’ to include a list of bloods to be requested; (3) production of an all-inclusive ‘Stroke Bloods Panel’ on the online system for requesting bloods. At baseline, an average of 30% and 34% of patients had glucose and cholesterol levels requested on admission, respectively. These results increased to 43% and 40% after the first intervention; 71% and 61% after the second intervention; and after the final intervention, on average, 82% and 85% of patients had glucose and cholesterol levels requested, respectively.

The use of tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor, has resulted in better outcomes in patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia in case reports and retrospective observational cohort studies. Data are needed from randomized, placebo-controlled trials. METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients who were hospitalized with severe Covid-19 pneumonia in a 2:1 ratio receive a single intravenous infusion of tocilizumab (at a dose of 8 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. Approximately one quarter of the participants received a second dose of tocilizumab or placebo 8 to 24 hours after the first dose. The primary outcome was clinical status at day 28 on an ordinal scale ranging from 1 (discharged or ready for discharge) to 7 (death) in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all the patients who had received at least one dose of tocilizumab or placebo. RESULTS: Of the 452 patients who underwent randomization, 438 (294 in the tocilizumab group and 144 in the placebo group) were included in the primary and secondary analyses. The median value for clinical status on the ordinal scale at day 28 was 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 1.0) in the tocilizumab group and 2.0 (non-ICU hospitalization without supplemental oxygen) (95% CI, 1.0 to 4.0) in the placebo group (between-group difference, −1.0; 95% CI, −2.5 to 0; P=0.31 by the van Elteren test). In the safety population, serious adverse events occurred in 103 of 295 patients (34.9%) in the tocilizumab group and in 55 of 143 patients (38.5%) in the placebo group. Mortality at day 28 was 19.7% in the tocilizumab group and 19.4% in the placebo group (weighted difference, 0.3 percentage points (95% CI, –7.6 to 8.2; nominal P=0.94). CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial involving hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia, the use of tocilizumab did not result in significantly better clinical status or lower mortality than placebo at 28 days.

As the public health workforce declined following the 2008 financial crisis, many US jurisdictions struggled to hire a sufficient number of staff for roles initially including testing and contact tracing and more recently for vaccination. Ultimately, COVID-19 control will require a combination of vaccination and rapid investigation, contact tracing, and quarantine to stop chains of transmission. New federal resources for a public health workforce have been made available. With appropriate attention to addressing administrative barriers and ensuring equity, a 21st-century US public health workforce will hasten the control of COVID-19, provide economic relief to individuals and communities, and reduce the burden of other infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases, and other disease burdens. A long-term commitment to a robust public health workforce is vital to ensuring health security and preparedness for future health threats.","Kilmarx, Peter H; Long, Theodore; Reid, Michael J A",Open Forum Infect Dis,142,20

In this study, a 3-6 month follow-up study was performed to examine serum levels of laboratory values in 107 discharged COVID-19 patients (mild = 59; severe/critical = 48; diagnoses on admission). 61 patients had a revisit chest CT scan. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze changes in laboratory values. LDL-c and HDL-c levels were significantly higher at follow-up than at admission in severe/critical cases (p < 0.05). LDL-c levels were significantly higher at follow-up than at admission in mild cases (p < 0.05). With adjustment of the factor of traditional Chinese medicine, LDL-c and HDL-c levels were significantly improved at follow-up than at admission in severe/critical cases (p < 0.05). Increases in HDL-c significantly correlated with increases in numbers of white blood cells (p<0.001) and decreases in levels of C-reactive protein (p < 0.05) during patients' recovery.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 102 patients with severe COVID-19 infections. The patients were divided into a survival group (n = 73) and a non-survival group (n = 29) according to their prognosis. The age, sex, underlying diseases, clinical laboratory data within 48 h (routine blood tests, ALT, AST, TBIL, ALB, BUN, CR, D-Dimer, PT, APTT, FIB, F VIII:C, CK-MB, CK, and LDH), and ventilation status were collected. The organ functions of these severe COVID-19 patients were assessed by comparing the differences between the two groups. RESULTS: AST, BUN, CR, CK-MB, LDH, and CK in the non-survival group were higher than those in the survival group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). D-Dimer, PT, FIB, and F VIII:C in the non-survival group were higher than the values observed in the survival group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05).

We evaluated asthma‐related emergency department (ED) and inpatient health care utilization by a county‐specific Medicaid population, ages 2–18, during the COVID‐19 pandemic and compared it to utilization from a 3‐year average including 2017–2019. All‐cause ED utilization and asthma medication fill rates were evaluated during the same timeframes. Relative to the 2017–2019 3‐year average, cumulative asthma‐related ED visits from January through June decreased by 45.8% (p = .03) and inpatient admission rates decreased by 50.5% (p = .03). The decline in asthma‐related ED utilization was greater than the reduction of overall ED use during the same time period, suggesting that the decline involved factors specific to asthma and was not due solely to avoidance of health care facilities. Fill rates for asthma controller medications decreased during this time (p = .03) and quick relief medication fill rates had no significant change (p = .31). Multiple factors may have contributed to the decrease in acute asthma health care visits. Locally, decreased air pollution and viral exposures coincided with the “Stay‐at‐home” order in Ohio, and increased utilization of telehealth for assessment during exacerbations may have impacted outcomes. Identification of the cause of the decline in visit rates could spur new interventions to limit the need for ED and inpatient visits for asthma patients, leading to both economic and health‐associated benefits.","Ulrich, Lisa; Macias, Charlie; George, Ashish; Bai, Shasha; Allen, Elizabeth",Pediatr Pulmonol,142,20

Recent large-scale screens have identified hundreds of such factors, yet little is known about how viruses exploit any of these. Influenza virus infection post-translationally activates P58(IPK), a cellular inhibitor of the interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated eIF2α kinase, PKR. Here, we report that infection of P58(IPK) knockout mice with influenza virus resulted in increased lung pathology, immune cell apoptosis, PKR activation, and mortality. Analysis of lung transcriptional profiles, including those induced by the reconstructed 1918 pandemic virus, revealed increased expression of genes associated with the cell death, immune, and inflammatory responses. These experiments represent the first use of a mammalian infection model to demonstrate the role of P58(IPK) in the antiviral response. Our results suggest that P58(IPK) represents a new class of molecule, a cellular inhibitor of the host defense (CIHD), as P58(IPK) is activated during virus infection to inhibit virus-induced apoptosis and inflammation to prolong host survival, even while prolonging viral replication.","Goodman, Alan G.; Fornek, Jamie L.; Medigeshi, Guruprasad R.; Perrone, Lucy A.; Peng, Xinxia; Dyer, Matthew D.; Proll, Sean C.; Knoblaugh, Sue E.; Carter, Victoria S.; Korth, Marcus J.; Nelson, Jay A.; Tumpey, Terrence M.; Katze, Michael G.",PLoS Pathog,142,18

In the case of the coronavirus pandemic, accurate threat appraisal is difficult due to incomplete medical knowledge as well as complex social factors (e.g., mixed public health messages). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the degree to which individuals accurately perceive COVID-19 infection rates and to explore the role of COVID-19 threat perception on emotional and behavioral responses both cross sectionally and prospectively. Methods: A community sample (N = 249) was assessed using online crowdsourcing and followed for one month. COVID-19 threat appraisal was compared with actual COVID-19 infection rates and deaths at the time of data collection in each participant’s county and state. It was predicted that actual versus perceived COVID-19 infection rates would only be modestly associated. Relative to actual infection rates, perceived infection rates were hypothesized to be a better predictor of COVID-related behaviors, distress, and impairment. Results: Findings indicated that relative to actual infection, perceived infection was a better predictor of COVID-related outcomes cross sectionally and longitudinally. Interestingly, actual infection rates were negatively related to behaviors cross sectionally (e.g., less stockpiling). Prospectively, these variables interacted to predict avoidance behaviors over time such that the relationship between perceived infection and avoidance was stronger as actual infection increased. Conclusions: These data suggest that perceived COVID-19 infection is significantly associated with COVID-related behaviors, distress and impairment whereas actual infection rates have a less important and perhaps even paradoxical influence on behavioral responses to the pandemic.","Schmidt, Norman B.; Martin, Alex D.; Allan, Nicholas P.; Mathes, Brittany M.; Saulnier, Kevin G.; March, David S.",J Psychiatr Res,142,5

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A study of 40 distal interphalangeal (DIP), 40 proximal interphalangeal (PIP), 50 metacarpophalangeal (MCP), 10 interphalangeal (IP) of the thumb, and 10 trapezo-metacarpophalangeal (TMC) joints was performed on ten hands. Under magnification and a proper surgical approach, we collected the course, the source origin, the number of articular nerve branches, and their caliber. RESULTS: In total, 118 nerve branches arising from the proper palmar digital nerves were found on 10 DIP of each dissected long finger (n = 40). A total of 226 nerve branches were found on 10 PIPs of each long finger (n = 40), of which 204 branches (90.3%) had a palmar origin. Dorsal innervation was found for the ring and little finger, originating from the dorso-ulnar digital nerve. 212 branches were found on 10 MCP of long fingers (n = 40), including 87 branches of palmar origin (41.1%), 107 branches of dorsal origin (50.4%), and 18 branches of the motor branch of the ulnar nerve (8.5%). 42 articular branches directed to the TMC joint (n = 10) were found. 13 branches (31%) originated from the anterior sensory branch of the radial nerve, 13 branches (31%) originated from the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm, 5 branches (12%) originated from the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve, and 11 (26%) branches originated from the thenar branch of the median nerve. The involvement of the sensory anterior branch of the radial nerve was always present for the innervation of each TMC. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our research shows that finger joints receive their primary innervation from small branches of the digital nerves with the exception of the MCP joint and the TMC joint. To obtain an efficient and a selective digital denervation for articular pain relief, it is necessary to plan the best surgical approach and it is crucial to recognize the articular nervous branch localization and source.","Gandolfi, S.; Auquit-Auckbur, I.; Chaput, B.; Duparc, F.",Surg Radiol Anat,142,8

For each patient, the risk of contracting COVID-19 during the perioperative period, with the potential for life-threatening sequelae (1), has to be weighed against the risk of delaying treatment. We assessed the response and short-term outcomes from elective colorectal cancer surgery during the pandemic at our institution. METHOD: We report a prospective cohort study of all elective colorectal surgery cases performed at our Trust during the 11 weeks following the national UK lockdown on 23rd March 2020, compared with the same time period in 2019. RESULTS: Eighty-five colorectal operations were performed during the 2020 (COVID) time period, and 179 performed in the 2019 (non-COVID) time period. A significantly higher proportion of cases during the COVID period were cancer-related (66% vs 26%, p < 0.00001). There was no difference in length of hospital stay, complications or readmissions. There were no mortalities in either cohort. Among the cancer patients, there were no differences in TMN staging, R1 resection rate or lymph node yields. No elective patient tested positive for COVID-19 during the perioperative period. CONCLUSION: At the height of the COVID pandemic, we maintained delivery the of high-quality elective colorectal cancer surgery, with no worsening of short-term outcomes and no compromise in the quality of cancer resections. Ongoing monitoring of this cohort is essential. The risks associated with COVID-19 will continue for some time, necessitating adaptive responses to maintain high-quality cancer services.","Merchant, Julia; Lindsey, Ian; James, David; Symons, Nick; Boyce, Stephen; Jones, Oliver; George, Bruce; Cunningham, Chris",World J Surg,142,22

The underlying mechanism of antioxidation of LEO was investigated by RT-qPCR and western blotting. Our results showed that LEO treatment promoted cell viability; remarkably downregulated the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) production, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); and upregulated the nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in H(2)O(2)-induced HUVECs. At the same time, LEO treatment significantly promoted the phosphorylation level of angiogenic protein PI3K, Akt, and eNOS and the expression level of survival factor Bcl2 and decreased the expression level of death factor Bax and caspase3. In conclusion, our findings suggested that LEO can ameliorate the oxidative stress damage and insufficient angiogenesis of HUVECs induced by H(2)O(2) through activating the PI3K/Akt-eNOS signaling pathway.","Liao, Li; Gong, Lihong; Zhou, Mengting; Xue, Xinyan; Li, Yunxia; Peng, Cheng",Oxid Med Cell Longev,142,13

This study aims to investigate the correlation between the extent of lung infection and relevant clinical laboratory testing indicators in COVID-19 and to analyse its underlying mechanism. METHODS: Chest high-resolution computer tomography (CT) images and laboratory examination data of 31 patients with COVID-19 were extracted, and the lesion areas in CT images were quantitatively segmented and calculated using a deep learning (DL) system. A cross-sectional study method was carried out to explore the differences among the proportions of lung lobe infection and to correlate the percentage of infection (POI) of the whole lung in all patients with clinical laboratory examination values. RESULTS: No significant difference in the proportion of infection was noted among various lung lobes (P > 0.05). The POI of total lung was negatively correlated with the peripheral blood lymphocyte percentage (L%) (r = − 0.633, P < 0.001) and lymphocyte (LY) count (r = − 0.555, P = 0.001) but positively correlated with the neutrophil percentage (N%) (r = 0.565, P = 0.001). Otherwise, the POI was not significantly correlated with the peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) count, monocyte percentage (M%) or haemoglobin (HGB) content. In some patients, as the infection progressed, the L% and LY count decreased progressively accompanied by a continuous increase in the N%. CONCLUSIONS: Lung lesions in COVID-19 patients are significantly correlated with the peripheral blood lymphocyte and neutrophil levels, both of which could serve as prognostic indicators that provide warning implications, and contribute to clinical interventions in patients.

In this study, we review the currently collected information about coronaviruses and establish a model of differential equations with piecewise constant arguments to discuss the spread of the infection from the natural host to the intermediate, and from them to the human host, while we focus on the potential spillover of bat-borne coronaviruses. The local stability of the positive equilibrium point of the model is considered via the Linearized Stability Theorem. Besides, we discuss global stability by employing an appropriate Lyapunov function. To analyze the outbreak in early detection, we incorporate the Allee effect at time t and obtain stability conditions for the dynamical behavior.

Previous studies demonstrate that SM is acquired by a Brefeldin A (BFA)-sensitive vesicular trafficking pathway, although paradoxically, this pathway is dispensable for bacterial replication. This finding suggests that other lipid transport mechanisms are involved in the acquisition of host SM. In this work, we interrogated the role of specific components of BFA-sensitive and BFA-insensitive lipid trafficking pathways to define their contribution in SM acquisition during infection. We found that C. trachomatis hijacks components of both vesicular and non-vesicular lipid trafficking pathways for SM acquisition but that the SM obtained from these separate pathways is being utilized by the pathogen in different ways. We show that C. trachomatis selectively co-opts only one of the three known BFA targets, GBF1, a regulator of Arf1-dependent vesicular trafficking within the early secretory pathway for vesicle-mediated SM acquisition. The Arf1/GBF1-dependent pathway of SM acquisition is essential for inclusion membrane growth and stability but is not required for bacterial replication. In contrast, we show that C. trachomatis co-opts CERT, a lipid transfer protein that is a key component in non-vesicular ER to trans-Golgi trafficking of ceramide (the precursor for SM), for C. trachomatis replication. We demonstrate that C. trachomatis recruits CERT, its ER binding partner, VAP-A, and SM synthases, SMS1 and SMS2, to the inclusion and propose that these proteins establish an on-site SM biosynthetic factory at or near the inclusion. We hypothesize that SM acquired by CERT-dependent transport of ceramide and subsequent conversion to SM is necessary for C. trachomatis replication whereas SM acquired by the GBF1-dependent pathway is essential for inclusion growth and stability. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which an intracellular pathogen redirects SM biosynthesis to its replicative niche.","Elwell, Cherilyn A.; Jiang, Shaobo; Kim, Jung Hwa; Lee, Albert; Wittmann, Torsten; Hanada, Kentaro; Melancon, Paul; Engel, Joanne N.",PLoS Pathog,142,21

In addition, respiratory physiotherapy and noninvasive ventilation generate massive amounts of aerosols. Caring for a patient suffering from coronavirus disease‐19 raises concerns about the risk of infection not only to the caregiver and/or medical staff but also to other individuals in contact with these personnel. We reviewed the points to be noted in infection control when a patient with neuromuscular diseases receiving respiratory care is infected with COVID‐19 and summarizes the recommendation. Infected patients must be isolated in a negative‐pressure or actively ventilated room. Clear zoning separating clean and infected areas should be performed for pathogen containment. Caregivers should wear appropriate personal protective equipment and thoroughly clean their hands. Leak‐prevention measures and the use of proper respiratory circuits and filters with virus‐removal performance are crucial to reducing aerosols in noninvasive ventilation. Although respiratory physiotherapy is essential, treatment should be minimized in consideration of the infection state and sputum status, and alternative therapies such as postural drainage should be carefully considered. Infection control is distinctly obligate; however, it impairs the quality of life and activity of daily living significantly. We should implement it with enough ethical consideration, adequate explanation, and patient consent. We hope that this paper will contribute to appropriate COVID‐19 infection control in patients with neuromuscular diseases requiring respiratory care.","Matsumura, Tsuyoshi; Saito, Toshio; Mori, Masahide; Kishida, Miki; Tamagaki, Kengo; Yoshida, Yoshiaki; Ishikawa, Yuka; Komai, Kiyonobu; Goto, Kazuya; Komori, Tetsuo",Neurol Clin Neurosci,142,1

Anti‐CD13 monoclonal antibodies MY7 and SJ1D1 (which do not inhibit APN activity) and WM15 (an APN‐blocking antibody) inhibited the growth of the AML cell line U937 and induced apoptosis, as evidenced by cell accumulation in the sub‐G(1) phase, DNA fragmentation, and phosphatidylserine externalization.

Methods: Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by qRT-PCR assay. Results: The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using qRT-PCR assay (P=0.001). Conclusions: The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are significantly higher than throat swabs.

DESIGN: Retrospective single-center study. SETTING: ICUs at a large academic medical center in the United States. SUBJECTS: Adult, critically ill patients admitted to ICU, with 27 patients admitted for acute respiratory failure due to coronavirus disease 2019 and 37 patients admitted for diagnoses other than coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Review of electronic health record. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Many U.S. states released crisis standards of care guidelines with algorithms to allocate scarce healthcare resources during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We compared state guidelines that represent different approaches to incorporating disease severity and comorbidities: New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Colorado. Following each algorithm, we calculated priority scores at the time of ICU admission for a cohort of patients with primary diagnoses of coronavirus disease 2019 and diseases other than coronavirus disease 2019 (n = 64). We assessed discrimination of 28-day mortality by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We simulated real-time decision-making by applying the triage algorithms to groups of two, five, or 10 patients. For prediction of 28-day mortality by priority scores, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.56, 0.49, 0.53, 0.66, and 0.69 for New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Colorado, and raw Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score algorithms, respectively. For groups of five patients, the percentage of decisions made without deferring to a lottery were 1%, 57%, 80%, 88%, and 95% for New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Colorado, and raw Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score algorithms, respectively. The percentage of decisions made without lottery was higher in the subcohort without coronavirus disease 2019, compared with the subcohort with coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of comorbidities does not consistently improve an algorithm’s performance in predicting 28-day mortality. Crisis standards of care algorithms result in a substantial percentage of tied priority scores. Crisis standards of care algorithms operate differently in cohorts with and without coronavirus disease 2019. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the feasibility and importance of empirical testing of crisis standards of care guidelines to understand whether they meet their goals.","Bharadwaj, Maheetha; Jezmir, Julia L.; Kishore, Sandeep P.; Winkler, Marisa; Diephus, Bradford; Haider, Hibah; Crowley, Conor P.; Pinilla-Vera, Mayra; Varon, Jack; Baron, Rebecca M.; Feldman, William B.; Kim, Edy Y.",Crit Care Explor,142,33

Appropriate personal protection for medical staffs is critical. For ocular protection, there is ongoing hot debate and concern for potential ocular transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Ocular manifestations and positive detection of viral RNA in ocular samples were only reported in very small number of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, health care workers need to face patients more closely and have higher risk of aerosol contamination. Thus, appropriate ocular protection for medical workers is still recommended by organizations such as WHO and American Academy of Ophthalmology. Although eye goggles provide excellent protection and are mandatory for medical practitioners with high risk of exposure, they are not ideal for common clinical practice, because they can disturb vision due to extensive formation of water droplets and frequently cause moderate to severe discomfort after longtime wearing, which have been reported to interfere with working status. For the majority of medical workers who don't deal with high risk patients, they are not advised to wear goggles in daily practice. However, they also face the risk of infection due to the presence of asymptomatic carriers. Especially in situations with high risk of ocular exposure, such as close physical examination, eye surgery, dental clinics and surgery, ocular protection may be needed. Griffithsin has been shown to directly bind to spike proteins and has anti-viral activity against a broad spectrum of viruses, including coronavirus. Griffithsin is found to inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV at relatively low concentration and is stable and non-toxic. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share the same entry receptors and their spike proteins are similar in conformation. We hypothesize that contact lenses containing nanoparticles loaded with griffithsin may provide sufficient ocular protection for medical staffs without high risk of exposure during the outbreak period of SARS-CoV-2. If proven effective, griffithsin-loaded contact lens can be considered as a supplementary ocular protective equipment for medical workers who can tolerate well. The daily disposable contact lens should be applied as needed and refrain from extended wearing in order to reduce potential side effects.","Wang, Lixiang; Deng, Yingping",Front Public Health,142,20

The 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in the Republic of Korea has also shown super-spreading events with a significantly high level of heterogeneity in generating secondary cases. It becomes critical to understand the mechanism for this high level of heterogeneity to develop effective intervention strategies and preventive plans for future emerging infectious diseases. In this regard, agent-based modeling is a useful tool for incorporating individual heterogeneity into the epidemic model. In the present work, a stochastic agent-based framework is developed in order to understand the underlying mechanism of heterogeneity. Clinical (i.e., an infectivity level) and social or environmental (i.e., a contact level) heterogeneity are modeled. These factors are incorporated in the transmission rate functions under assumptions that super-spreaders have stronger transmission and/or higher links. Our agent-based model has employed real MERS-CoV epidemic features based on the 2015 MERS-CoV epidemiological data. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out under various epidemic scenarios. Our findings highlight the roles of super-spreaders in a high level of heterogeneity, underscoring that the number of contacts combined with a higher level of infectivity are the most critical factors for substantial heterogeneity in generating secondary cases of the 2015 MERS-CoV transmission.","Kim, Yunhwan; Ryu, Hohyung; Lee, Sunmi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,142,23

In early-stage cervical cancer, postponing hysterectomy for 6–8 weeks is suggested as a possible option in the Covid-19 burdened hospitals. Yet, literature examining the impact of surgery wait-time on survival in early-stage cervical cancer remains scarce. This study examined the association between surgery wait-time of 8 weeks and oncologic outcome in women with early-stage cervical cancer. METHODS: This is a single institution retrospective observational study at a tertiary referral medical center examining women who underwent primary hysterectomy or trachelectomy for clinical stage IA-IIA invasive cervical cancer between 2000 and 2017 (N = 217). Wait-time from the diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer via biopsy to definitive surgery was categorized as: short wait-time (<8 weeks; n = 110) versus long wait-time (≥8 weeks; n = 107). Propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance the measured demographics between the two groups, and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. A systematic literature review with meta-analysis was additionally performed. RESULTS: In a weighted model (median follow-up, 4.6 years), women in the long wait-time group had DFS (4.5-year rates, 91.2% versus 90.7%, hazard ratio [HR] 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47–2.59, P = 0.818) and OS (95.0% versus 97.4%, HR 1.47, 95%CI 0.50–4.31, P = 0.487) similar to those in the short wait-time group.

Adopting appropriate mitigation strategies can reduce the impact on family members. PURPOSE: To assess the emotional impact of COVID-19 epidemic lockdown and mitigation measures among households in Ebonyi State. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey design was used to study 516 participants. Emotional impact of COVID-19 lockdown (r = 0.73) and mitigation options (r = 0.92) questionnaire was used for data collection. Of the 516 copies of the questionnaire distributed, 493 copies (95.5% return rate) were used for data analysis. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, standard deviations, and t-tests. RESULTS: The data showed the emotional impact of the COVID-19 epidemic was high (2.97 ± 0.48) on households. They embraced friendly communication and communication with their partners, maintaining regular contact with their loved ones by phone, email, social media, or video conference to alleviate the COVID-19 lockdown. No significant differences were found in the emotional impact for location (p > 0.05). Significant differences were not observed in many gender-based mitigation options. Conversely, a significant difference existed in the mitigation options based on location (t = 3.143, p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in friendly interactions and communication with partners (t = 0.354, p > 0.05), finding opportunities to develop excellent and promising news and images (t = 0.770, p > 0.05) and maintaining regular communication with loved ones via phone, email, social media, and video conference (t = 0.448, p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The emotional impact of COVID-19 confinement was significant on family life and was more prevalent among men and urban dwellers. There is need to organise an awareness campaign on fundamental ways to overcome emotional distress using media targeting family members to promote emotional health.","Elom, Nwamaka A; Nwimo, Ignatius O; Elom, Sampson Omena; Alegu, Deborah N; Afoke, Eunice N; Okpata, Onyekachi O; Ogodo, Juliet O; Ilo, Cajetan I; Okeworo, Chukwuma G; Elom, Chinyere O",SAGE Open Med,142,20

The quarantine period during corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak might affect the quality of life leading thousands of individuals to diminish the daily caloric expenditure and mobility, leading to a sedentary behavior and increase the number of health disorders. Exercising is used as a non-pharmacological treatment in many chronic diseases. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of physical exercise in COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. We also point links between exercise, mental, and cardiovascular health. The infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 affects host cells binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. If there is not enough oxygen supply the lungs and other tissues, such as the heart or brain, are affected. SARS-CoV-2 enhances ACE2 leading to inflammation and neuronal death with possible development of mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Physical exercise also enhances the ACE2 expression. Conversely, the activation of ACE2/Ang 1-7/Mas axis by physical exercise induces an antiinflammatory and antifibrotic effect. Physical exercise has beneficial effects on mental health enhancing IGF-1, PI3K, BDNF, ERK, and reducing GSK3β levels. In addition, physical exercise enhances the activity of PGC-1α/ FNDC5/Irisin pathway leading to neuronal survival and the maintenance of a good mental health. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to elevation of ACE2 levels through pathological mechanisms that lead to neurological and cardiovascular complications, while the physiological response of ACE2 to physical exercise improves cardiovascular and mental health.","De Sousa, Ricardo Augusto Leoni; Improta-Caria, Alex Cleber; Aras-Júnior, Roque; de Oliveira, Edilamar Menezes; Soci, Úrsula Paula Reno; Cassilhas, Ricardo Cardoso",Neurol Sci,142,32

The virus has spread globally and the infection was declared pandemic in March 2020. Although most cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are mild, some of them rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the clinical management, chest X-rays (CXR) are essential, but the evaluation of COVID-19 CXR could be a challenge. In this context, we developed COVID-19 TRAINING, a free Web application for training on the evaluation of COVID-19 CXR. The application included 196 CXR belonging to three categories: non-pathological, pathological compatible with COVID-19, and pathological non-compatible with COVID-19. On the training screen, images were shown to the users and they chose a diagnosis among those three possibilities. At any time, users could finish the training session and be evaluated through the estimation of their diagnostic accuracy values: sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and global accuracy. Images were hand-labeled by four thoracic radiologists. Average values for sensitivity, specificity, and global accuracy were .72, .64, and .68. Users who achieved better sensitivity registered less specificity (p < .0001) and those with higher specificity decreased their sensitivity (p < .0001). Users who sent more answers achieved better accuracy (p = .0002). The application COVID-19 TRAINING provides a revolutionary tool to learn the necessary skills to evaluate COVID-19 on CXR. Diagnosis training applications could provide a new original manner of evaluation for medical professionals based on their diagnostic accuracy values, and an efficient method to collect valuable data for research purposes.","Fernández-Miranda, P.

Wrapp et al., “Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation,” Science 367(6483), 1260–1263 (2020)] in exquisite detail about the new coronavirus, along with how it differs from previous viruses. We call the virus particle causing the COVID-19 disease SARS-CoV-2, a spherical capsid covered with spikes termed peplomers. Since the virus is not motile, it relies on its own random thermal motion, specifically the rotational component of this thermal motion, to align its peplomers with targets. The governing transport property for the virus to attack successfully is thus the rotational diffusivity. Too little rotational diffusivity and too few alignments are produced to properly infect. Too much, and the alignment intervals will be too short to properly infect, and the peplomer is wasted. In this paper, we calculate the rotational diffusivity along with the complex viscosity of four classes of virus particles of ascending geometric complexity: tobacco mosaic, gemini, adeno, and corona. The gemini and adeno viruses share icosahedral bead arrangements, and for the corona virus, we use polyhedral solutions to the Thomson problem to arrange its peplomers. We employ general rigid bead–rod theory to calculate complex viscosities and rotational diffusivities, from first principles, of the virus suspensions. We find that our ab initio calculations agree with the observed complex viscosity of the tobacco mosaic virus suspension. From our analysis of the gemini virus suspension, we learn that the fine detail of the virus structure governs its rotational diffusivity. We find the characteristic time for the adenovirus from general rigid bead–rod theory. Finally, from our analysis of the coronavirus suspension, we learn that its rotational diffusivity descends monotonically with its number of peplomers.","Kanso, M. A.; Piette, J. H.; Hanna, J.

However, health services are still too oriented towards acute situations. To overcome this problem, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a set of Age-Friendly Principles that seek to optimize the provision of health care for this population. This article aims to understand how such Principles are considered in the implementation of age-friendly health care worldwide. Methods: A systematic review was conducted to synthesize the literature on age-friendly health care in accordance with the PRISMA recommendations in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Results: The research identified 34 articles, with only seven recognizing the WHO Principles and only four using the implementation toolkit. In addition, in the context of primary care, three studies recognize the WHO Principles, but only two use the toolkit. Conclusions: The WHO Principles are being implemented in health care, but in a smaller scale than desired, which reveals possible flaws in their dissemination and standardization. Thus, a greater scientific investment in age-friendly health care should be considered, which represents a greater operationalization of the Principles and an evaluation of their effectiveness and impacts.","Tavares, Jéssica; Santinha, Gonçalo; Rocha, Nelson P.",Healthcare (Basel),142,1

RESULTS The results showed that the adverse impact of job stress on work engagement disappeared when nurses engaged in high levels of micro-break activity. Moreover, the moderating role of micro-break activity was mediated by psychological detachment.

Some viruses use specific packaging signals, which are conserved sequence/structure motifs present only in the full-length genome. Recent work has shown that viral proteins important for packaging can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), where one or two viral nucleic acid binding proteins condense with the genome. The compositional simplicity of viral components lends itself well to theoretical modeling compared to more complex cellular organelles. Viral LLPS can be limited to one or two viral proteins and a single genome that is enriched in LLPS-promoting features. In our previous study, we observed that LLPS-promoting sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are located at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the genome, whereas the middle of the genome is predicted to consist mostly of solubilizing elements. Is this arrangement sufficient to drive single genome packaging, genome compaction, and genome cyclization? We addressed these questions using a coarse-grained polymer model, LASSI, to study the LLPS of nucleocapsid protein with RNA sequences that either promote LLPS or solubilization. With respect to genome compaction and cyclization, we find the most optimal arrangement restricts LLPS-promoting elements to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the genome, consistent with the native spatial patterning. Single genome packaging is possible for diverse arrangements of LLPS-promoting sequences in the genome, but only in limited conditions at the edge of the phase boundary. These results suggest that many and variably positioned LLPS promoting signals can support packaging in the absence of a singular packaging signal which argues against necessity of such a feature. We hypothesize that this model should be generalizable to multiple viruses as well as cellular organelles like paraspeckles, which enrich specific, long RNA sequences in a defined order.","Seim, Ian; Roden, Christine A.; Gladfelter, Amy S.",bioRxiv,142,2

It is necessary to estimate the cases that might be underestimated based on county-level data, to take better countermeasures against COVID-19. We suggested taking time-varying Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models with unreported infection rates (UIR) to estimate factual COVID-19 cases in the United States. Methods: Both the SIR model integrated with unreported infection rates (SIRu) of fixed-time effect and SIRu with time-varying parameters (tvSIRu) were applied to estimate and compare the values of transmission rate (TR), UIR, and infection fatality rate (IFR) based on US county-level COVID-19 data. Results: Based on the US county-level COVID-19 data from 22 January (T(1)) to 20 August (T(212)) in 2020, SIRu was first tested and verified by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. Further regression of SIRu at the county-level showed that the average values of TR, UIR, and IFR were 0.034%, 19.5%, and 0.51% respectively. The ranges of TR, UIR, and IFR for all states ranged from 0.007–0.157 (mean = 0.048), 7.31–185.6 (mean = 38.89), and 0.04–2.22% (mean = 0.22%). Among the time-varying TR equations, the power function showed better fitness, which indicated a decline in TR decreasing from 227.58 (T(1)) to 0.022 (T(212)). The general equation of tvSIRu showed that both the UIR and IFR were gradually increasing, wherein, the estimated value of UIR was 9.1 (95%CI 5.7–14.0) and IFR was 0.70% (95%CI 0.52–0.95%) at T(212). Interpretation: Despite the declining trend in TR and IFR, the UIR of COVID-19 in the United States is still on the rise, which, it was assumed would decrease with sufficient tests or improved countersues.

The objective of the current study was to assess the impact of lockdown measures on a cohort of eating disorder (ED) patients being followed as part of an ongoing naturalistic treatment study. METHODS: Ninety-nine patients aged 18 or older, currently or previously, in treatment at a Portuguese specialized hospital unit were contacted by phone and invited to participate in the current survey. Fifty-nine agreed to be interviewed by phone, and 43 agreed to respond to a set of self-report measures of ED symptoms, emotion regulation difficulties, clinical impairment, negative urgency, and COVID-19 impact, during the week after the end of the lockdown period. RESULTS: Data showed that of the 26 patients currently in treatment: 8 remained unchanged (31%), 7 deteriorated (27%), and 11 reliably improved (42%). Of the 17 participants not currently in treatment: 3 deteriorated (18%), 9 remained unchanged (53%), and 5 (29%) improved after the lockdown period. The Coronavirus Impact Scale showed that most patients considered their routines moderately or extremely impacted, experienced stress related to coronavirus, and showed difficulty in maintaining physical exercise and feeding routines. Results suggest that higher impact of COVID-19 lockdown was significantly correlated with eating disorder symptoms and associated psychopathology, impulsivity, difficulties in emotion regulation and clinical impairment measured at post-lockdown. In addition, the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown measures on clinical impairment was mediated by difficulties in emotion regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that some ED patients may experience worsening of their condition, especially if associated with difficulties in emotion regulation, and these difficulties might be exacerbated in the context of a stressful crisis and lockdown measures, highlighting the need for intervention strategies to mitigate its negative impact.","Machado, Paulo P.

We isolated a large number of nAbs from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals capable of disrupting proper interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) protein and the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In order to understand the mechanism of these nAbs on neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 virus infections, we have performed cryo-EM analysis and here report cryo-EM structures of the ten most potent nAbs in their native full-length IgG or Fab forms bound to the trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The bivalent binding of the full-length IgG is found to associate with more RBD in the “up” conformation than the monovalent binding of Fab, perhaps contributing to the enhanced neutralizing activity of IgG and triggering more shedding of the S1 subunit from the S protein. Comparison of large number of nAbs identified common and unique structural features associated with their potent neutralizing activities. This work provides structural basis for further understanding the mechanism of nAbs, especially through revealing the bivalent binding and their correlation with more potent neutralization and the shedding of S1 subunit.","Yan, Renhong; Wang, Ruoke; Ju, Bin; Yu, Jinfang; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Liu, Nan; Wang, Jia; Zhang, Qi; Chen, Peng; Zhou, Bing; Li, Yaning; Zhang, Shuyuan; Tian, Long; Zhong, Xinyue; Cheng, Lin; Ge, Xiangyang; Zhao, Juanjuan; Wang, Hong-Wei; Wang, Xinquan; Zhang, Zheng; Zhang, Linqi; Zhou, Qiang",bioRxiv,142,16

This study describes the results of an argument-based review of ethical guidelines developed at the European level. It aims to increase knowledge and awareness about the moral relevance of the outbreak, especially as regards the balance of equity and dignity in clinical practice and patient’s care. METHOD: According to the argument-based review framework, we started our research from the following two questions: what are the ethical principles adopted by the ethical guidelines produced at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak related to resource allocation? And what are the practical consequences in terms of 'priority' of access, access criteria, management of the decision-making process and patient care? RESULTS: Twenty-two ethical guidelines met our inclusion criteria and the results of our analysis are organized into 4 ethical concepts and related arguments: the equity principle and emerging ethical theories; triage criteria; respecting patient’s dignity, and decision making and quality of care. CONCLUSION: Further studies can investigate the practical consequences of the application of the guidelines described, in terms of quality of care and health care professionals’ moral distress.

However, scant data are available on the causes of this increase or subpopulations at elevated risk. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the rates and characteristics of deaths from drug overdose before vs during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective, population-based cohort study used data from 4 statewide databases linked at the person level via the Rhode Island Data Ecosystem on adults with deaths due to overdose in Rhode Island from January 1 to August 31, 2019, and January 1 to August 31, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The rates of unintentional deaths from drug-related overdose during the 2019 and 2020 observation periods overall and by sociodemographic characteristics, drugs contributing to the cause of death, location of death, and socioeconomic factors were evaluated. In subgroup analyses restricted to Medicaid beneficiaries (n = 271), the proportions of deaths from overdose by behavioral health treatment and diagnosis claims in the year before death were also examined. RESULTS: A total of 470 adults who died of drug overdose were included in the analysis (353 men [75%]; mean [SD] age, 43.5 [12.1] years). The rate of deaths from overdose in Rhode Island increased 28.1%, from 29.2 per 100 000 person-years in 2019 to 37.4 per 100 000 person-years in 2020 (P = .009). Compared with 2019, rates of deaths due to overdose during 2020 were higher among men (43.2 vs 59.2 per 100 000 person-years; P = .003), non-Hispanic White individuals (31.0 vs 42.0 per 100 000 person-years; P = .005), single individuals (54.8 vs 70.4 per 100 000 person-years; P = .04), deaths involving synthetic opioids (20.8 vs 28.3 per 100 000 person-years; P = .005), and deaths occurring in a personal residence (13.2 vs 19.7 per 100 000 person-years; P = .003). A decrease in the proportion of deaths from overdose involving heroin (11 of 206 [5%] vs <2% [exact value suppressed]; P = .02) and an increase among persons experiencing job loss (16 of 206 [8%] vs 41 of 264 [16%]; P = .01) from 2019 to 2020 were observed. Among individuals who died of overdose and were Medicaid beneficiaries, the proportions of those aged 50 to 59 years with anxiety (11 of 121 [9%] vs 29 of 150 [19%]; P = .03), men with depression (27 of 121 [22%] vs 57 of 150 [38%]; P = .008), and men with anxiety (28 of 121 [23%] vs 55 of 150 [37%]; P = .02) increased during 2020 compared with 2019. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, during the first 8 months of 2020, the rate of deaths from overdose increased in Rhode Island compared with the same period in 2019, and several emerging characteristics of deaths from drug overdose during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic were identified.

To ensure continuity of care, the reproductive genetic counselors at a large academic medical center in the United States rapidly transitioned their practice from 90% in‐person patient consultations to a predominantly telehealth model. The present study describes this transition in regard to patient access to genetic counseling and genetic screening. A chart review of patients seen by the reproductive genetic counselors from January 2020 to August 2020 was completed. The time frame included the three months prior to the COVID‐19 pandemic and the first five months during COVID‐19. Patient demographics and clinical and appointment data were compared between the pre‐COVID‐19 and during‐COVID‐19 timeframes. Overall, 88.6% of patients were seen via telehealth during COVID‐19 and there was no significant difference based upon patient age (p = .20), indication for appointment (p = .06), or gestational age (p = .06). However, non‐English speaking patients were more often seen in‐person than by telehealth (p < .001), and more patients residing farther from the clinic were seen via telehealth (p = .004). During‐COVID‐19 results for prenatal cell‐free DNA screening and expanded carrier screening were delayed (p < .001). Additionally, after consenting to screening, patients seen during COVID‐19 were more likely to not complete a sample collection for their intended screening when compared to those seen pre‐COVID‐19 (OR = 6.15, 95% CI = 1.43–26.70, p = .015). Overall, this study supports that access to genetic counseling services and genetic screening can be maintained during a global pandemic like COVID‐19. Genetic counselors are well‐equipped to pivot swiftly during challenging times; however, they must continue to work to address other barriers to accessing genetic services, especially for non‐English speaking populations. Future studies are needed to pose solutions to the obstacles confronted in this service delivery model during a global pandemic.","Mann, Caitlin; Goodhue, Brighton; Guillard, Arianna; Slamon, Jill; Newman, Randa; Zhao, Zhiguo; Ding, Tan; Petrelli, Gianna; Dudek, Martha",J Genet Couns,142,28

The modest mutation rate and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 prevents the reconstruction of transmission chains from consensus genome sequences, but within-host genetic diversity could theoretically help identify close contacts. Here we describe the patterns of within-host diversity in 1,181 SARS-CoV-2 samples sequenced to high depth in duplicate. 95% of samples show within-host mutations at detectable allele frequencies. Analyses of the mutational spectra revealed strong strand asymmetries suggestive of damage or RNA editing of the plus strand, rather than replication errors, dominating the accumulation of mutations during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Within and between host diversity show strong purifying selection, particularly against nonsense mutations. Recurrent within-host mutations, many of which coincide with known phylogenetic homoplasies, display a spectrum and patterns of purifying selection more suggestive of mutational hotspots than recombination or convergent evolution. While allele frequencies suggest that most samples result from infection by a single lineage, we identify multiple putative examples of co-infection. Integrating these results into an epidemiological inference framework, we find that while sharing of within-host variants between samples could help the reconstruction of transmission chains, mutational hotspots and rare cases of superinfection can confound these analyses.","Tonkin-Hill, Gerry; Martincorena, Inigo; Amato, Roberto; Lawson, Andrew R J; Gerstung, Moritz; Johnston, Ian; Jackson, David K; Park, Naomi R; Lensing, Stefanie V; Quail, Michael A; Gonçalves, Sónia; Ariani, Cristina; Chapman, Michael Spencer; Hamilton, William L; Meredith, Luke W; Hall, Grant; Jahun, Aminu S; Chaudhry, Yasmin; Hosmillo, Myra; Pinckert, Malte L; Georgana, Iliana; Yakovleva, Anna; Caller, Laura G; Caddy, Sarah L; Feltwell, Theresa; Khokhar, Fahad A; Houldcroft, Charlotte J; Curran, Martin D; Parmar, Surendra; Alderton, Alex; Nelson, Rachel; Harrison, Ewan; Sillitoe, John; Bentley, Stephen D; Barrett, Jeffrey C; Torok, M.

Between 5% and 30% of patients affected by this disease require management in an intensive care unit. Different documents have been published with recommendations for the general population. However, in the obstetric patient, the scientific evidence is limited, and even more so when it comes to COVID-19 infection in obstetric intensive care settings. For this reason, an unsystematic narrative review of the literature was performed using MEDLINE, scientific societies, as well as the repositories of the World Health Organisation and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Colombia as sources of information, in order to describe the management of a pregnant patient with COVID-19 in an intensive care unit. It is emphasised that care must be carried out by a multidisciplinary team, using maternal and fetal monitoring when appropriate. It is also suggested that there must be monitoring of oxygen saturation and maternal haemodynamics in order to minimise fetal hypoxaemia. A description is also presented of some recommendations on relevant topics in the critical scenario that include, among others, timely intubation, the adequate use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), the management of circulatory failure, as well as fluid and vasopressor restriction strategies.","Borre, Diana; Santacruz, Jose; Gonzalez-Hernandez, Jeniffer; Anichiarico, Walter; Romero, Jorge Rubio",,142,16

On their websites, universities publish their academic offerings, their mission, their vision, their academic objectives, their achievements, their regulations, their news and all their university work. Hence, the importance of university websites is accessible. The accessibility of university websites has been evaluated several times in the past, but there is no work that has summarized all the evaluations performed to provide a general overview of the situation. Therefore, in this research we have performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to consolidate, analyze, synthesize and interpret the accessibility results of university websites published in 42 papers that have been selected for this study. The methodology used in this SLR was that proposed in Kitchenham’s guidelines, which includes three stages: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. The results present the analysis and synthesis of the evaluations of 9,140 universities in 67 countries. Of these, 38,416 web pages, 91,421 YouTube videos and 28,395 PDF documents were evaluated. Manual methods, methods with automatic tools and the combination of both methods were used for the evaluation. Most websites were evaluated using the ISO/IEC 40500:2012 and Section 508 standards. The accessibility guidelines most commonly violated in the evaluations were: adaptable, compatible, distinguishable, input assistance, keyboard accessible, navigable, predictable, readable and text alternatives. In conclusion, the university websites, YouTube videos and PDF documents analyzed in the 42 papers present important accessibility problems. The main contribution of this SLR is the consolidation of the results of the 42 studies selected to determine the findings and trends in the accessibility of university websites around the world.","Campoverde-Molina, Milton; Luján-Mora, Sergio; Valverde, Llorenç",Univers Access Inf Soc,142,1

The resident immune cells of the lung play vital roles in host defense. However, the effect of perinatal events associated with BPD on pulmonary-specific immune cells is not well understood. METHODS: We used a double-hit model of BPD induced by prenatal chorioamnionitis followed by postnatal hyperoxia, and performed a global transcriptome analysis of all resident pulmonary immune cells. RESULTS: We show significant up-regulation of genes involved in chemokine-mediated signaling and immune cell chemotaxis, and down-regulation of genes involved in multiple T lymphocyte functions. Multiple genes involved in T cell receptor signaling are downregulated and Cd8a gene expression remains downregulated at 2 months of age in spite of recovery in normoxia for 6 weeks. Furthermore, the proportion of CD8a+CD3+ pulmonary immune cells is decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has highlighted that perinatal lung inflammation in a double-hit model of BPD results in short- and long-term dysregulation of genes associated with the pulmonary T cell receptor signaling pathway, which may contribute to increased environmental pathogen-associated respiratory morbidities seen in children and adults with BPD. IMPACT: In a translationally relevant double-hit model of BPD induced by chorioamnionitis and postnatal hyperoxia, we identified pulmonary immune cell-specific transcriptomic changes and showed that T cell receptor signaling genes are downregulated in short term and long term. This is the first comprehensive report delineating transcriptomic changes in resident immune cells of the lung in a translationally relevant double-hit model of BPD. Our study identifies novel resident pulmonary immune cell-specific targets for potential therapeutic modulation to improve short- and long-term respiratory health of preterm infants with BPD.","Shrestha, Diksha; Ye, George Xiangyun; Stabley, Deborah; Betal, Suhita Gayen nee’; Zhu, Yan; Glazewski, Lisa; Holbrook, Jennifer; Sethi, Meharpreet; Hesek, Anne; Shaffer, Thomas H.; Aghai, Zubair H.; Addya, Sankar; Alapati, Deepthi",Pediatr Res,142,30

The currently used PCR as well as chest X-ray and CT scanning have important disadvantages. The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of POCUS in patients with suspected pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 in the ED. METHODS: This prospective diagnostic accuracy study was conducted at the ED of our non-academic level 1 trauma centre (Isala, Zwolle, the Netherlands). Patients were enrolled between 14 April and 22 April 2020. Patients (aged ≥16 years) with suspected COVID-19 presenting to the ED underwent POCUS. All patients received current standard of care, including PCR (naso-oropharyngeal swab). Outcome of POCUS was compared with PCR or CT scan outcome to determine diagnostic accuracy. Diagnostic accuracy measures were calculated using 2×2 contingency tables. RESULTS: 100 patients were eligible to participate in this study, data of 93 patients were analysed. 27 (29%) patients were found positive for COVID-19 by PCR or CT. POCUS had a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 70% to 97%), specificity of 59% (95% CI 46% to 71%), negative predictive value of 93% (95% CI 79% to 98%) and positive predictive value of 47% (95% CI 33% to 61%). In a subgroup of patients without previous cardiopulmonary disease (n=37), POCUS had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 70% to 100%), specificity of 76% (95% CI 54% to 90%), negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI 79% to 100%) and positive predictive value of 67% (95% CI 41% to 86%). CONCLUSION: POCUS of the lungs could serve as a valuable, radiation-free tool for excluding pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 in patients in the ED at the point of assessment, especially in patients without previous cardiopulmonary disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this observational, multicentre, retrospective study conducted in the Lazio region, Italy, we compared the differences in the HbA1c levels of 141 subjects with T2D exposed to lockdown with 123 matched controls with T2D who attended the study centres 1 year before. Basal data were collected from 9 December to 9 March and follow‐up data from 3 June to 10 July in 2020 for the lockdown group, and during the same timeframes in 2019 for the control groups. Changes in HbA1c (ΔHbA1c) and body mass index (ΔBMI) during lockdown were compared among patients with different psychological well‐being, as evaluated by tertiles of the Psychological General Well‐Being Index (PGWBS). RESULTS: No difference in ΔHbA1c was found between the lockdown and control groups (lockdown group −0.1% [−0.5%−0.3%] vs. control group −0.1% [−0.4%−0.2%]; p = .482). Also, no difference was found in ΔBMI (p = .316) or ΔGlucose (p = .538). In the lockdown group, subjects with worse PGWBS showed a worsening of HbA1c (p = .041 for the trend among PGWBS tertiles) and BMI (p = .022). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID‐19 lockdown did not significantly impact glycaemic control in people with T2D. People with poor psychological well‐being may experience a worsening a glycaemic control because of restrictions resulting from lockdown. These findings may aid healthcare providers in diabetes management once the second wave of COVID‐19 has ended.","D'Onofrio, Luca; Pieralice, Silvia; Maddaloni, Ernesto; Mignogna, Carmen; Sterpetti, Sara; Coraggio, Lucia; Luordi, Cecilia; Guarisco, Gloria; Leto, Gaetano; Leonetti, Frida; Manfrini, Silvia; Buzzetti, Raffaella",Diabetes Obes Metab,142,12

In late, 2019 an unnamed genetic relative, later named SARS-CoV-2 realized its potential in the highly populous neighborhoods of Wuhan, China. Unchecked, the virus rapidly spread among interconnected communities and related households before containment measures could be in acted. “Appropriate” diagnostic testing in response to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak should be urgently considered. This perspective review gives particular attention to the potential diagnostic testing of the virus in semen and seminal fluids due to its high levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) precursor. RECENT FINDINGS: As many infectious viruses are stable in semen and have transmitted the respective diseases, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 should be tested in semen to assess their stabilities and half-life. As in case of Ebola virus, it was present in semen for longer period in a carrier man without any symptom. Additional hypothesis is that since ACE2 could serve as a mediator for the endocytosis of the previously SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 may enter the cells through similar mechanism.

This study describes the teaching strategies and outcomes in 3 different times of the COVID-19 pandemic through a dynamic assessment of medical skills and well-being of trainees. METHODS: Three surveys were administered during 2020 to General Surgery residents and fellows in a University Hospital in Argentina. Perceptions on the impact of COVID-19 were described. The stress rate and risk factors were analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 124 answers; 59% were men. 82% of trainees reported concerns about the loss of surgical skills in early phase 1. Time spent with academic activities increased in 94.5% of the cases. Due to the prompt implementation of changes, by the end of 2020, 73% participated in a greater number of procedures (p=0.003); Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) use related problems dropped from 40 to 14% (p=0.031) and the lack of adequate spaces where trainees could express reduced from 28% to zero. Half of the trainees felt stressed and 18% required psychological assistance; reporting problems with PPE use was identified as a risk factor (p=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Assessing trainees’ perceptions at 3 different times of the COVID-19 pandemic enabled the implementation of dynamic changes. The negative impact on surgical training was partially offset by the optimal use of virtual learning. Half of them felt stressed, identifying problems in the use of PPE as a predisposing factor.","Rodriguez Santos, Fanny; González Salazar, Esteban; Dietrich, Agustin; Cano Busnelli, Virginia; Roni, Carolina; Facioni, Clara; Mutchinick, Agustina; Palavecino, Martin; Beskow, Axel; Figari, Marcelo; Pekolj, Juan; de Santibañes, Martín",Surgery,142,30

The development of ARDS has been reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to determine whether serum KL-6 levels are associated with mortality and severity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Among 361 Japanese patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Kanagawa Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center between February 2020 and December 2020, 356 patients with data on serum KL-6 levels were enrolled and their medical records were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A negative correlation was observed between KL-6 levels and the ratio of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen on admission. The KL-6 levels on admission and the maximal KL-6 levels were higher in patients with severe disease (n = 60) than in those with nonsevere disease (n = 296). Furthermore, the maximal KL-6 levels were higher in nonsurvivors (n = 6) than in survivors (n = 350). In nonsurvivors, the KL-6 levels increased as the disease progressed. The optimal cutoff value of the maximal KL-6 level for discriminating between survivors and nonsurvivors was 684 U/mL, with a sensitivity of 83.3%, a specificity of 90.5%, and an area under the curve of 0.89. CONCLUSIONS: The serum KL-6 level was associated with disease severity.

Many outpatient visits were cancelled or forgone for fear of exposure to the virus, allowing telemedicine to take on a much larger role in healthcare. The delivery of manual therapies, such as osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), via telehealth posed a unique challenge as these are typically provided in-person by a trained osteopathic physician. This study provides a description of one osteopathic pediatrician's experience in delivering osteopathic interventions to pediatric patients via telehealth. To our knowledge, these techniques have not previously been described in the literature. OBJECTIVES: To detail the experience of one osteopathic pediatrician's experience in delivering osteopathic interventions via telehealth. METHODS: Patients were offered the option of converting their existing OMT appointment to a telehealth visit. Prior to the appointment, instructions were emailed to the patient's parent or guardian along with a voluntary survey to provide feedback. Thirty-minute telehealth visits were conducted during which the provider gave verbal and visual instructions to a parent or guardian over a video platform to guide them in providing treatment to the patient based on osteopathic principles. Patients aged 3 and older rated their pain before and after the appointment using the Wong-Baker FACES scale. Deidentified patient demographics, chief complaints, treatments, anatomic locations, and pain scores were recorded in a REDcap database. Descriptive statistics were analyzed and paired samples t-tests were used with a p-value of <0.05 used to determine significance. RESULTS: Eighteen patients ranging from 6 months to 19 years of age were treated utilizing osteopathic interventions via telehealth during 54 distinct visits. The most common chief complaints treated were back (n=31; 26.3%) and neck (n=28; 23.7%) pain. The most common osteopathic techniques upon which instruction was based were inhibition (n=131; 29.7%) soft tissue (n=127; 28.8%) and counterstrain (n=78; 17.7%). The average post-treatment pain score (2.57) was significantly lower than the average pre-treatment pain score (6.77) p<0.01. No serious complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In our small retrospective case series, osteopathic interventions via telehealth resulted in decreased average pain scores following treatment while minimizing risk of viral exposure and transmission. Further study is needed to determine if such treatment methods could be effective on a larger scale when distance or illness preclude an in-person OMT visit.","Kramer, Joanna L; De Asis, Kathleen",Journal of osteopathic medicine,142,28

Methods: From April 23rd to May 8th 2020, we recruited a sample of participants from five sectors: healthcare, air transport, police, road transport and informal. We collected oropharyngeal swab for direct detection through real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and blood for antibodies detection by serological tests. The overall prevalence (current and past) of infection was defined by positivity for both tests. Results: A total of 955 participants with a median age of 36 (IQR 32-43) were included and 71.6% (n=684) were men. Around 22.1% (n=212) were from the air transport sector, 20.5% (n=196) in the police, and 38.7% (n=370) in the health sector. Seven participants (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.3-1.6%) had a positive rRT-PCR at the time of recruitment and nine (0.9%, 95% CI: 0.4-1.8%) were seropositive for IgM or IgG against SARS-CoV-2. We found an overall prevalence of 1.6% (n=15), 95% CI: 0.9-2.6%. Conclusion: The prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection among high-risk populations in Lomé was relatively low and could be explained by the various measures taken by the Togolese government. Therefore, we recommend targeted screening.","Halatoko, W. A.; KONU, Y. R.; Gbeasor-Komlanvi, F. A.; Sadio, A. J.; Tchankoni, M. K.; Komlanvi, K. S.; Salou, M.; Dorkenoo, A.

However, environmental deterioration is observed. No studies have ever been conducted to examine the link between economic growth and environmental degradation, focusing on the important role of the FDI, in Vietnam in both short run and long run. Using the ARDL and the threshold regression techniques for 35 years from 1986, Vietnam’s “Doi Moi” (economic renovation), the U-shaped relationship between economic growth and the environmental quality is found in the long run and at the upper threshold of economic growth. FDI in the long run and at the upper threshold of economic growth also leads to further deterioration of the environmental quality. Also, consumption of fossil fuel energy deteriorates the environment in the long run, and at any level of economic growth.

However, because SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays may remain positive for months after infection, positive results may represent active or past infection. We determined the prevalence and infectiousness of patients who were admitted for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 but tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on admission screening. METHODS: We conducted an observational study at the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics from July 7 to October 25, 2020. All patients admitted without suspicion of COVID-19 were included, and medical records of those with a positive admission screening test were reviewed. Infectiousness was determined using patient history, PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value, and serology. RESULTS: In total, 5,913 patients were screened and admitted for reasons unrelated to COVID-19. Of these, 101 had positive admission RT-PCR results; 36 of these patients were excluded because they had respiratory signs/symptoms on admission on chart review. Also, 65 patients (1.1%) did not have respiratory symptoms. Finally, 55 patients had Ct values available and were included in this analysis. The median age of the final cohort was 56 years and 51% were male. Our assessment revealed that 23 patients (42%) were likely infectious. The median duration of in-hospital isolation was 5 days for those likely infectious and 2 days for those deemed noninfectious. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 was infrequent among patients admitted for reasons unrelated to COVID-19. An assessment of the likelihood of infectiousness using clinical history, RT-PCR Ct values, and serology may help in making the determination to discontinue isolation and conserve resources.","Alsuhaibani, Mohammed A.; Kobayashi, Takaaki; Trannel, Alexandra; Holley, Stephanie; Abosi, Oluchi J.; Jenn, Kyle E.; Meacham, Holly; Sheeler, Lorinda; Etienne, William; Dains, Angelique; Kukla, Mary E.; Ward, Emily; Ford, Bradley; Edmond, Michael B.; Wellington, Melanie; Diekema, Daniel J.; Salinas, Jorge L.",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,142,24

However, data on IPC compliance among healthcare workers in COVID-19 treatment centers are unknown in Ghana. This study aims to assess IPC compliance among healthcare workers in Ghana’s COVID-19 treatment centers. The study was a secondary analysis of data, which was initially collected to determine the level of risk of COVID-19 virus infection among healthcare workers in Ghana. Quantitative data were conveniently collected using the WHO COVID-19 risk assessment tool. We analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses. We observed that IPC compliance during healthcare interactions was 88.4% for hand hygiene and 90.6% for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) usage; IPC compliance while performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), was 97.5% for hand hygiene and 97.5% for PPE usage. For hand hygiene during healthcare interactions, lower compliance was seen among nonclinical staff [OR (odds ratio): 0.43; 95% CI (Confidence interval): 0.21–0.89], and healthcare workers with secondary level qualification (OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.08–0.71). Midwives (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.09–0.93) and Pharmacists (OR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.02–0.92) compliance with hand hygiene was significantly lower than registered nurses. For PPE usage during healthcare interactions, lower compliance was seen among healthcare workers who were separated/divorced/widowed (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01–0.43), those with secondary level qualifications (OR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01–0.43), non-clinical staff (OR 0.16 95% CI 0.07–0.35), cleaners (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.05–0.52), pharmacists (OR: 0.07; 95% CI: 0.01–0.49) and among healthcare workers who reported of insufficiency of PPEs (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.14–0.77). Generally, healthcare workers’ infection prevention and control compliance were high, but this compliance differs across the different groups of health professionals in the treatment centers. Ensuring an adequate supply of IPC logistics coupled with behavior change interventions and paying particular attention to nonclinical staff is critical in minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the treatment centers.","Ashinyo, Mary Eyram; Dubik, Stephen Dajaan; Duti, Vida; Amegah, Kingsley Ebenezer; Ashinyo, Anthony; Asare, Brian Adu; Ackon, Angela Ama; Akoriyea, Samuel Kaba; Kuma-Aboagye, Patrick",PLoS One,142,14

The present study sought to assess whether phenotypes can be derived from intensive care patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to assess the correlation with prognosis, and to develop a parsimonious model for phenotype identification. Methods: Adult patients with COVID-19 from Tongji hospital between January 2020 and March 2020 were included. The consensus k means clustering and latent class analysis (LCA) were applied to identify phenotypes using 26 clinical variables. We then employed machine learning algorithms to select a maximum of five important classifier variables, which were further used to establish a nested logistic regression model for phenotype identification. Results: Both consensus k means clustering and LCA showed that a two-phenotype model was the best fit for the present cohort (N = 504). A total of 182 patients (36.1%) were classified as hyperactive phenotype, who exhibited a higher 28-day mortality and higher rates of organ dysfunction than did those in hypoactive phenotype. The top five variables used to assign phenotypes were neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), ratio of pulse oxygen saturation to the fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (Spo(2)/Fio(2)) ratio, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and urea nitrogen. From the nested logistic models, three-variable (NLR, Spo(2)/Fio(2) ratio, and LDH) and four-variable (three-variable plus TNF-α) models were adjudicated to be the best performing, with the area under the curve of 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.94–0.97] and 0.97 (95% CI = 0.96–0.98), respectively. Conclusion: We identified two phenotypes within COVID-19, with different host responses and outcomes.

We aimed to identify CXR features that correlate with severe COVID-19. METHODS: All confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted within the study period were screened. Those with suboptimal baseline CXR were excluded. CXRs were reviewed by three independent radiologists and opacities recorded according to zones and laterality. The primary endpoint was defined as hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen, and CXR features were assessed for association with this endpoint to identify high-risk features. These features were then used to define criteria for a high-risk CXR, and clinical features and outcomes of patients with and without baseline high-risk CXR were compared using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 109 patients were included. In the initial analysis of 40 patients (36.7%) with abnormal baseline CXR, presence of bilateral opacities, multifocal opacities, or any upper or middle zone opacity were associated with supplemental oxygen requirement. Of the entire cohort, 29 patients (26.6%) had a baseline CXR with at least one of these features. Having a high-risk baseline CXR was significantly associated with requiring supplemental oxygen in univariate (odds ratio 14.0, 95% confidence interval 3.90–55.60) and multivariate (adjusted odds ratio 8.38, 95% CI 2.43–28.97, P = 0.001) analyses. CONCLUSION: We identified several high-risk CXR features that are significantly associated with severe illness. The association of upper or middle zone opacities with severe illness has not been previously emphasized. Recognition of these specific high-risk CXR features is important to prioritize limited healthcare resources for sicker patients.","Ong, Sean Wei Xiang; Hui, Terrence Chi Hong; Lee, Yeong Shyan; Haja Mohideen, Salahudeen Mohamed; Young, Barnaby Edward; Tan, Cher Heng; Lye, David Chien",PLoS One,142,1

In order to be prepared for a new epidemic or pandemic or a “second wave” of COVID-19 outbreak and to meet a renewed deficiency of PPE, considerations were made on how personnel and patients can be better protected by appropriate provisioning. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a tool to predict the necessary amount of PPE to be in stock at a transregional university hospital for a certain period of time during a pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The consumption of PPE needed for every patient was calculated based on the following data of the Ulm University Hospital: the total consumption of healthcare workers’ PPE for April 2020 recorded by the materials management department and the number of patients suffering from COVID-19 and their treatment days. From the amount of PPE necessary for every patient in the intensive care unit (ICU) or in an infection ward, a PPE calculator was created in which the estimated amount of PPE can be calculated with the input variables “patients in intensive care unit”, “patients in infection ward” and “treatment days”. To validate the PPE calculator, the actual consumption of PPE for May 2020 at the Ulm University hospital was compared to the theoretically calculated demand by the PPE calculator. RESULTS: In April 2020 PPE consisting of 18 different items were kept in stock at Ulm University Hospital and in total 1,995,500 individual items were used. 22 intensive care patients with 257 nursing days and in the infection ward 39 patients with 357 nursing days were treated for COVID-19 disease, leading to a total of 603.2 man-days. A total of 34,550 KN95 masks, 1,558,780 gloves and 1100 goggles or protective visors were used, with a daily average of 49 NK95 masks and 2216 gloves required per ICU patient. In May 2020, 6 ICU patients and 19 patients in infection wards were treated for COVID-19 with 34 nursing days in intensive care and 201 nursing days in infection wards. The use of PPE material was 39% lower than in the previous month but in absolute terms 82% and on average 39% higher than calculated. CONCLUSION: The developed tool allows our hospital to estimate the necessary amount of PPE to be kept in stock for future pandemics. By taking local conditions into account this tool can also be helpful for other hospitals.","Pfenninger, E. G.; Kaisers, U. X",Anaesthesist,142,16

Evidence supporting its quality and safety is required. AIMS: Assess the efficacy and safety of telephone clinics in delivering care to established oncology patients and assess patient and health professionals’ preference (telephone vs face‐to‐face clinics). METHODS: Retrospective chart audit in the month preceding and month following introduction of telephone clinics at the Gold Coast University hospital and a patient and health professional questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 1212 clinical encounters occurred in the month post the introduction of telephone clinics (vs 1208 encounters prior). There were no statistically significant differences in 24‐h (18 vs 22, p = 0.531) or 7‐day admissions (50 vs 46, p = 0.665) comparing encounters in the month prior to the introduction of telephone clinics vs the month post, but there was a statistically significant difference in 30‐day mortality post systemic therapy in favour of the post‐telephone clinic period (7 vs 0 patients, p = 0.008). Of the 222 patients who undertook the questionnaire, 42.3% preferred telephone clinics (95% CI 35.97–48.97), 25.2% preferred face‐to‐face clinics (95% CI 19.92–31.39) and 32.4% did not prefer one method over another. Of the 24 health professionals who undertook the questionnaire, 70.8% felt patients preferred phone clinics. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, patients and clinicians viewed telephone clinics favourably.

The association between exposure to volatile organic compounds, particulate matter, house dust mite, molds and bacteria in day care centers (DCC) is not completely clear. The aim of this project was to study these effects. METHODS – STUDY DESIGN: This study comprised two phases. Phase I included an evaluation of 45 DCCs (25 from Lisbon and 20 from Oporto, targeting 5161 children). In this phase, building characteristics, indoor CO(2) and air temperature/relative humidity, were assessed. A children's respiratory health questionnaire derived from the ISAAC (International Study on Asthma and Allergies in Children) was also distributed. Phase II encompassed two evaluations and included 20 DCCs selected from phase I after a cluster analysis (11 from Lisbon and 9 from Oporto, targeting 2287 children). In this phase, data on ventilation, IAQ, thermal comfort parameters, respiratory and allergic health, airway inflammation biomarkers, respiratory virus infection patterns and parental and child stress were collected. RESULTS: In Phase I, building characteristics, occupant behavior and ventilation surrogates were collected from all DCCs. The response rate of the questionnaire was 61.7% (3186 children). Phase II included 1221 children. Association results between DCC characteristics, IAQ and health outcomes will be provided in order to support recommendations on IAQ and children's health. A building ventilation model will also be developed. DISCUSSION: This paper outlines methods that might be implemented by other investigators conducting studies on the association between respiratory health and indoor air quality at DCC.","Araújo-Martins, J.; Carreiro Martins, P.; Viegas, J.; Aelenei, D.; Cano, M.M.; Teixeira, J.P.; Paixão, P.; Papoila, A.L.; Leiria-Pinto, P.; Pedro, C.; Rosado-Pinto, J.; Annesi-Maesano, I.; Neuparth, N.",Rev Port Pneumol (2006),142,16

After SARS, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control accelerated and strengthened domestic research on influenza and expanded the exchange of information with international counterparts. The capacity of influenza A to cross species barriers presents a potential threat to human health. Given the mutations of avian flu viruses such as H7N9, H6N1, and H10N8, all countries, including Taiwan, must equip themselves to face a possible epidemic or pandemic.

Rapid planetary-scale processes have reinforced and further created vast injustices at international, national, and subnational levels. Often, the burden has fallen most severely on the poor and marginalized communities. Yet the literature on planetary justice tends to stay at the level of ideal conceptions and abstract normative arguments of justice theory, without an explicit concern for the needs of the poor. In this Perspective we focus discussions of planetary justice on the needs of the poorest. We discuss whether the dominant approaches to planetary stewardship and earth system governance are apt at realizing this notion of justice and what alternative approaches might be needed.","Kashwan, Prakash; Biermann, Frank; Gupta, Aarti; Okereke, Chuks",,142,13

The virally encoded 3C-like protease (3CL(Pro)) has been presumed critical for the viral replication of SARS-CoV in infected host cells. In this study, we screened a natural product library consisting of 720 compounds for inhibitory activity against 3CL(Pro). Two compounds in the library were found to be inhibitive: tannic acid (IC(50) = 3 µM) and 3-isotheaflavin-3-gallate (TF2B) (IC(50) = 7 µM). These two compounds belong to a group of natural polyphenols found in tea. We further investigated the 3CL(Pro)-inhibitory activity of extracts from several different types of teas, including green tea, oolong tea, Puer tea and black tea. Our results indicated that extracts from Puer and black tea were more potent than that from green or oolong teas in their inhibitory activities against 3CL(Pro). Several other known compositions in teas were also evaluated for their activities in inhibiting 3CL(Pro). We found that caffeine, (—)-epigallocatechin gallte (EGCg), epicatechin (EC), theophylline (TP), catechin (C), epicatechin gallate (ECg) and epigallocatechin (EGC) did not inhibit 3CL(Pro) activity. Only theaflavin-3,3′-digallate (TF3) was found to be a 3CL(Pro) inhibitor. This study has resulted in the identification of new compounds that are effective 3CL(Pro) inhibitors.","Chen, Chia-Nan; Lin, Coney P.

There is an urgent need for the characterization of humoral responses and success of a single-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in previously infected dialysis patients. We performed a dual-center cohort study comparing three different groups: 25 unvaccinated hemodialysis patients after PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (Group 1), 43 hemodialysis patients after two-time BNT162b2 vaccination without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Group 2), and 13 single-dose vaccinated hemodialysis patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Group 3). Group 3 consists of seven patients from Group 1 and 6 additional patients with sera only available after single-dose vaccination. Anti-S1 IgG, neutralizing antibodies, and antibodies against various SARS-CoV-2 protein epitopes were measured 3 weeks after the first and 3 weeks after the second vaccination in patients without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, 6 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 in unvaccinated patients, and 3 weeks after single-dose vaccination in patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively. Unvaccinated patients after COVID-19 showed a significantly higher neutralizing antibody capacity than two-time vaccinated patients without prior COVID-19 [median (IQR) percent inhibition 88.0 (71.5–95.5) vs. 50.7 (26.4–81.0); P = 0.018]. After one single vaccine dose, previously infected individuals generated 15- to 34-fold higher levels of anti-S1 IgG than age- and dialysis vintage-matched unvaccinated patients after infection or two-time vaccinated patients without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with a median (IQR) index of 274 (151–791) compared to 18 (8–41) and 8 (1–21) (for both P < 0.001). With a median (IQR) percent inhibition of 97.6 (97.2–98.9), the neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was significantly higher in single-dose vaccinated patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to other groups (for both P < 0.01). Bead-based analysis showed high antibody reactivity against various SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes after single-dose vaccination in previously infected patients. In conclusion, single-dose vaccination in previously infected dialysis patients induced a strong and broad antibody reactivity against various SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes with high neutralizing capacity.","Speer, Claudius; Morath, Christian; Töllner, Maximilian; Buylaert, Mirabel; Göth, Daniel; Nusshag, Christian; Kälble, Florian; Schaier, Matthias; Grenz, Julia; Kreysing, Martin; Reichel, Paula; Hidmark, Asa; Ponath, Gerald; Schnitzler, Paul; Zeier, Martin; Süsal, Caner; Klein, Katrin; Benning, Louise",Front Med (Lausanne),142,26

However, nowadays, antibodies that can not only bind but can also alter the function of cell surface signaling components are increasingly sought after as therapeutic drugs. Therefore, the identification of such functional antibodies from a large antibody library is the subject of intensive research. New methods applied to combinatorial antibody libraries now allow the isolation of functional antibodies in the cellular environment. These selected agonist antibodies have provided new insights into important issues of signal transduction. Notably, when certain antibodies bind to a given receptor, the cell fate induced by them may be the same or different from that induced by natural agonists. In addition, combined with phenotypic screening, this platform allows us to discover unexpected experimental results and explore various phenomena in cell biology, such as those associated with stem cells and cancer cells.","Lin, Chih-Wei; Lerner, Richard A.",Int J Mol Sci,142,9

However, the origins and global transmission pattern of SARS-CoV-2 remain largely unknown. We aimed to characterize the origination and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 based on evolutionary dynamics. METHODS: Using the full-length sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with intact geographic, demographic, and temporal information worldwide from the GISAID database during 26 December 2019 and 30 November 2020, we constructed the transmission tree to depict the evolutionary process by the R package “outbreaker”. The affinity of the mutated receptor-binding region of the spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was predicted using mCSM-PPI2 software. Viral infectivity and antigenicity were tested in ACE2-transfected HEK293T cells by pseudovirus transfection and neutralizing antibody test. RESULTS: From 26 December 2019 to 8 March 2020, early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 strains identified worldwide were mainly composed of three clusters: the Europe-based cluster including two USA-based sub-clusters; the Asia-based cluster including isolates in China, Japan, the USA, Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, and Italy; and the USA-based cluster. The SARS-CoV-2 strains identified in the USA formed four independent clades while those identified in China formed one clade. After 8 March 2020, the clusters of SARS-CoV-2 strains tended to be independent and became “pure” in each of the major countries. Twenty-two of 60 mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein were predicted to increase the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2. Of all predicted mutants, the number of E484K was the largest one with 86 585 sequences, followed by S477N with 55 442 sequences worldwide. In more than ten countries, the frequencies of the isolates with E484K and S477N increased significantly. V367F and N354D mutations increased the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses (P < 0.001). SARS-CoV-2 with V367F was more sensitive to the S1-targeting neutralizing antibody than the wild-type counterpart (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 strains might have originated in several countries simultaneously under certain evolutionary pressure. Travel restrictions might cause location-specific SARS-CoV-2 clustering. The SARS-CoV-2 evolution appears to facilitate its transmission via altering the affinity to ACE2 or immune evasion.

The present study evaluated the validity and factor structure of Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) among a sample from the general Indonesian population. The English version of the FCV-19S was translated and back-translated into Indonesian language, followed by a pilot study. Using convenience sampling method, a total of 728 participants completed an online survey distributed on various social media platforms. The survey included the FCV-19S, personality traits (neuroticism and extraversion), Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The Indonesian FCV-19S had very good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha and McDonald’s omega) and composite reliability (alpha = 0.88, omega = .86, composite reliability = .87). Maximum likelihood confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to test construct validity (χ(2)/df = 2.51, CFI = .984, SRMR = .028, PCLOSE = .15 > .05, RMSEA = .06, 90% CI [.03, .09]). As for criterion-related validity, the FCV-19S score positively correlated with the score on PHQ-9, GAD-7, negative affect, and neuroticism and negatively correlated with extraversion. Negative affect was identified as the most important predictor of the fear of COVID-19. Personality traits also predicted the fear of COVID-19. The findings provide evidence that the FCV-19S is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing fear generated by COVID-19 among a healthy Indonesian-speaking population.","Nazari, Nabi; Safitri, Shahnaz; Usak, Muhammet; Arabmarkadeh, Arman; Griffiths, Mark D.",Int J Ment Health Addict,142,18

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cohort study was designed to evaluate whether a therapeutic algorithm using steroids with or without interleukin-1 antagonist (anakinra) could prevent death/invasive ventilation. Patients with a ≥5-day evolution since symptoms onset, with hyper-inflammation (CRP≥50mg/L), requiring 3–5 L/min oxygen, received methylprednisolone alone. Patients needing ≥6 L/min received methylprednisolone + subcutaneous anakinra daily either frontline or in case clinical deterioration upon corticosteroids alone. Death rate and death or intensive care unit (ICU) invasive ventilation rate at Day 15, with Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% CIs, were determined according to logistic regression and propensity scores. A Bayesian analysis estimated the treatment effects. RESULTS: Of 108 consecutive patients, 70 patients received glucocorticoids alone. The control group comprised 63 patients receiving standard of care. In the corticosteroid±stanakinra group (n = 108), death rate was 20.4%, versus 30.2% in the controls, indicating a 30% relative decrease in death risk and a number of 10 patients to treat to avoid a death (p = 0.15). Using propensity scores a per-protocol analysis showed an OR for COVID-19-related death of 0.9 (95%CI [0.80–1.01], p = 0.067). On Bayesian analysis, the posterior probability of any mortality benefit with corticosteroids+/-anakinra was 87.5%, with a 7.8% probability of treatment-related harm. Pre-existing diabetes exacerbation occurred in 29 of 108 patients (26.9%).

However, its impact on stress and subsequent professional pathways is not well understood. This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental well-being, training, and career choices of Canadian medical clerks within the first three months of the pandemic. It also aims to assess their use of university support systems and their appreciation of potential solutions to common academic stressors. METHODS: An electronic survey composed of four sections: demographics, stressors experienced during the pandemic, World Health Organization (WHO) well-being index, and stress management and resources was distributed to Canadian clerks. RESULTS: Clerks from 10 of the 17 Canadian medical faculties participated in this study (n = 627). Forty-five percent of clerks reported higher levels of stress than usual; 22% reconsidered their residency choice; and 19% reconsidered medicine as a career. The factors that were most stressful among clerks were: the means of return to rotations; decreased opportunities to be productive in view of residency match; and taking the national licensing exam after the beginning of residency. The mean WHO well-being index was 14.8/25 ± 4.5, indicating a poor level of well-being among a considerable proportion of students. Clerks who reconsidered their residency choice or medicine as a career had lower mean WHO well-being indices. Most clerks agreed with the following suggested solutions: training sessions on the clinical management of COVID-19 cases; being allowed to submit fewer reference letters when applying to residency; and having protected time to study for their licensing exam during residency. Overall, clerks were less concerned with being infected during their rotations than with the impact of the pandemic on their future career and residency match.

Intense livestock production, increased travel, and changing climate have increased the risk of catastrophic animal losses due to infectious diseases. In the event of an outbreak, it is essential to properly manage the infected animals to prevent the spread of diseases. The most common disposal methods used during a disease outbreak include burial, landfilling, incineration and composting. Biosecurity, transportation logistics, public perception, and environmental concerns limit the use of some of these methods. During a disease outbreak, the large number of mortalities often exceeds the capacity of local rendering plants and landfills. Transporting mortalities to disposal and incineration facilities outside the production operation introduces biosecurity risks. Burying mortalities is limited by the size and availability of suitable sites and it has the risk of pathogen survival and contamination of groundwater and soil. Portable incinerators are expensive and have the potential to aerosolize infectious particles. Composting, on the other hand, has been recognized as a biosecure disposal method. Research showed that it eliminates bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157: H7, Salmonella spp., as well as viruses including highly pathogenic avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, Newcastle disease, and porcine epidemic diarrhea. This paper summarizes the lessons learned during the major animal disease outbreaks including the 2010 foot-and-mouth disease, 2016 highly pathogenic avian influenza, and recent African swine fever outbreaks.

Millions of people have been infected or died because of the outbreak. We know the common symptoms of the disease such as fever and cough. However, all symptoms and features of COVID‐19 are still were not known. We aimed to evaluate the change in lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) after COVID‐19 in men. METHODS: We prospectively assessed 94 patients with COVID‐19 during hospitalisation. The patients were divided into two groups according to age, that being over and under age 50. IPSS scores of all patients were enrolled. Additionally, we compared the scores with pre‐COVID‐19 values. RESULTS: LUTS scores were found to be increased in elderly patients. Additionally, the severity of the disease did not correlate with LUTS scores. CONCLUSION: LUTS may be one of the symptoms of COVID‐19 in some patients. Elderly patients with increased LUTS should be evaluated for COVID‐19 when the reason unclear.","Can, Osman; Erkoç, Mustafa; Ozer, Murat; Umeyir Karakanli, Musab; Otunctemur, Alper",Int J Clin Pract,142,26

The aim of our study was to report on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in our cancer patients. Data on vaccine side effects from our London cancer center was collected from 8 December 2020 to 28 February 2021. Reassuringly, we observed that cancer patients tolerated the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine very well with minimal serious side effects. Similar to the vaccine clinical trials, the most common side effects were having a sore arm, tiredness, and headaches. ABSTRACT: Emergency approval of vaccines against COVID-19 provides an opportunity for us to return to pre-pandemic oncology care. However, safety data in cancer patients is lacking due to their exclusion from most phase III trials. We included all patients aged less than 65 years who received a COVID-19 vaccine from 8 December 2020 to 28 February 2021 at our London tertiary oncology centre. Solicited and unsolicited vaccine-related adverse events (VRAEs) were collected using telephone or face-to-face consultation. Within the study period, 373 patients received their first dose of vaccine: Pfizer/BioNTech (75.1%), Oxford/AstraZeneca (23.6%), Moderna (0.3%), and unknown (1.1%). Median follow-up was 25 days (5–85). Median age was 56 years (19–65). Of the patients, 94.9% had a solid malignancy and 76.7% were stage 3–4. The most common cancers were breast (34.0%), lung (13.4%), colorectal (10.2%), and gynaecological (10.2%). Of the patients, 88.5% were receiving anti-cancer treatment (36.2% parenteral chemotherapy and 15.3% immunotherapy), 76.1% developed any grade VRAE of which 2.1% were grade 3. No grade 4/5 or anaphylaxis were observed. The most common VRAEs within 7 days post-vaccination were sore arm (61.7%), fatigue (18.2%), and headaches (12.1%). Most common grade 3 VRAE was fatigue (1.1%). Our results demonstrate that COVID-19 vaccines in oncology patients have mild reactogenicity.","So, Alfred Chung Pui; McGrath, Harriet; Ting, Jonathan; Srikandarajah, Krishnie; Germanou, Styliani; Moss, Charlotte; Russell, Beth; Monroy-Iglesias, Maria; Dolly, Saoirse; Irshad, Sheeba; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke; Enting, Deborah",Cancers (Basel),142,16

Early and accurate diagnosis and quarantine remain the most effective mitigation strategy. Although reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, recent studies suggest that nucleic acids were undetectable in a significant number of cases with clinical features of COVID-19. Serologic assays that detect human antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 serve as a complementary method to diagnose these cases, as well as to identify asymptomatic cases and qualified convalescent serum donors. However, commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are laborious and non-quantitative, while point-of-care assays suffer from low detection accuracy. To provide a serologic assay with high performance and portability for potential point-of-care applications, we developed DNA-assisted nanopore sensing for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 related antibodies in human serum. Different DNA structures were used as detection reporters for multiplex quantification of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in serum specimens from patients with conformed or suspected infection. Comparing to a clinically used point-of-care assay and an ELISA assay, our technology can reliably quantify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with higher accuracy, large dynamic range, and potential for assay automation.","Zhang, Zehui; Wang, Xiaoqin; Wei, Xiaojun; Zheng, Sophia W.; Lenhart, Brian J.; Xu, Peisheng; Li, Jie; Pan, Jing; Albrecht, Helmut; Liu, Chang",Biosens Bioelectron,142,5

To develop strategies for reducing anxiety and increasing adherence with health guidelines, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to anxiety and health compliance in the context of COVID-19. Earlier research has shown that greater perceived risk of negative events and their costs are associated with increased anxiety and compliance with health behaviors, but it is unclear what role they play in a novel pandemic surrounded by uncertainty. In the present study we measured (1) perceived risk as the self-reported probability of being infected and experiencing serious symptoms due to COVID-19 and (2) perceived cost as financial, real-world, physical, social, and emotional consequences of being infected with COVID-19. Worry was assessed using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PWSQ) and health compliance was measured as endorsement of the World Health Organization (WHO) health directives for COVID-19. Our results showed that greater perceived risk and costs of contracting the COVID-19 virus were associated with greater worry and while only costs were associated with greater compliance with health behaviors. Neither self-reported worry nor its interaction with cost estimates was associated with increased engagement in health behaviors. Our results provide important insight into decision making mechanisms involved in both increased anxiety and health compliance in COVID-19 and have implications for developing psychoeducational and psychotherapeutic strategies to target both domains.","Imbriano, Gabriella; Larsen, Emmett M.; Mackin, Daniel M.; An, Akaisha Kaixuan; Luhmann, Christian C.; Mohanty, Aprajita; Jin, Jingwen",Front Public Health,142,1

Thus, the spatial distribution of respiratory hospitalizations (2008–2017) and the relationship between this outcome and potential air pollution sources in the city of Rio de Janeiro (2013–2017) were evaluated. Methods: An ecological study was performed using the Bayesian model with multivariate Poisson regression for the period of the sporting events (2013–2017). The outcome was the ratio of hospitalizations for respiratory diseases by the population at risk. Data analysis was performed in the total population and by sex and age group. The air pollution-related variables included industrial districts, traffic density, tunnel portals, a seaport, airports, and construction/road work. Results: All explanatory variables, except tunnel portals, were associated with an increase in the outcome. Construction/road work showed a greater magnitude of association than the other pollution-related variables. Airports were associated with an increased hospitalization ratio among the ≥60 year-old group (mean = 2.46, 95% credible intervals = 1.35–4.46). Conclusion: This study allows for a better understanding of the geographical distribution of respiratory problems in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Present results may contribute to improved healthcare planning and raise hypotheses concerning exposure to air pollution and respiratory hospitalizations.","Campos, Élida; Pereira, Carlos Alexandre R.; Freire, Carmen; da Silva, Ilce F.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,142,20

METHODS: We undertook an observational study of 572 individuals with type 1 diabetes for whom paired flash glucose monitoring data were available between early March and May 2020. The primary outcome was change in flash glucose monitoring variables. We also assessed clinical variables associated with change in glycaemic control. RESULTS: Percentage of time in range increased between March and May 2020 [median (interquartile range) 53 (41–64)% vs 56 (45–68)%; P < 0.001], with associated improvements in standard deviation of glucose (P <0.001) and estimated HbA(1c) (P <0.001). There was a small reduction in the number of individuals meeting the hypoglycaemia target of <5% per day (64% vs 58%; P = 0.004). Comparing changes in flash glucose monitoring data from March to May in 2019 with the same period in 2020 confirmed that these differences were confined to 2020. Socio‐economic deprivation was an independent predictor of a ≥5% reduction in time in range during lockdown (odds ratio 0.45 for people in the two most affluent Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles; P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown was not associated with a significant deterioration in glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes using flash glucose monitoring. However, socio‐economic deprivation appeared to increase the risk of decline in glycaemic control, which has implications for how support is focused in challenging times.","Dover, A.R.; Ritchie, S.A.; McKnight, J.A.; Strachan, M.W.J.; Zammitt, N.N.; Wake, D.; Forbes, S.; Stimson, R.H.; Gibb, F.W.",Diabet Med,142,11

To date, no robust vaccine or treatment has been identified. Elemental zinc has previously been demonstrated to have beneficial effects on coronaviruses and other viral respiratory infections due to its effect on RNA polymerase. Additionally, zinc has well-demonstrated protective effects against hypoxic injury—a clear mechanism of end-organ injury in respiratory distress syndrome. We aimed to assess the effect of high-dose intravenous zinc (HDIVZn) on SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The purpose of this study was to analyze how older adults’ personal strengths predict their well-being and emotional distress. METHOD 783 Spanish people aged 60 and over completed a survey that included sociodemographic characteristics, perceived health, direct or indirect infection by COVID-19, resilience, gratitude, experiential avoidance, family functioning, emotional distress and well-being. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was performed. SEM invariance was also used to analyze whether there were differences between older people affected by COVID-19 and those not affected. RESULTS The best model supports the mediation effect of resilience, gratitude and experiential avoidance on older people’s well-being and emotional distress. Whether participants or relatives had been infected by the virus or not did not affect the results. CONCLUSIONS Variables used as criteria in older adults are related to well-being and emotional distress, but only indirectly and mediated by resilience, gratitude and experiential avoidance. This confirms the importance of considering psychological strengths in older people’s well-being.

Integration of an unmodified CTB-coding sequence into chloroplast genomes (up to 10,000 copies per cell), resulted in the accumulation of up to 4.1% of total soluble tobacco leaf protein as functional oligomers (410-fold higher expression levels than that of the unmodified LTB gene expressed via the nuclear genome). However, expresssion levels reported are an underestimation of actual accumulation of CTB in transgenic chloroplasts, due to aggregation of the oligomeric forms in unboiled samples similar to the aggregation observed for purified bacterial antigen. PCR and Southern blot analyses confirmed stable integration of the CTB gene into the chloroplast genome. Western blot analysis showed that the chloroplast-synthesized CTB assembled into oligomers and were antigenically identical with purified native CTB. Also, binding assays confirmed that chloroplast- synthesized CTB binds to the intestinal membrane GM1-ganglioside receptor, indicating correct folding and disulfide bond formation of CTB pentamers within transgenic chloroplasts. In contrast to stunted nuclear transgenic plants, chloroplast transgenic plants were morphologically indistinguishable from untransformed plants, when CTB was constitutively expressed in chloroplasts. Introduced genes were inherited stably in subsequent generations, as confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analyses. Increased production of an efficient transmucosal carrier molecule and delivery system, like CTB, in transgenic chloroplasts makes plant-based oral vaccines and fusion proteins with CTB needing oral administration commercially feasible. Successful expression of foreign genes in transgenic chromoplasts and availability of marker-free chloroplast transformation techniques augurs well for development of vaccines in edible parts of transgenic plants. Furthermore, since the quaternary structure of many proteins is essential for their function, this investigation demonstrates the potential for other foreign multimeric proteins to be properly expressed and assembled in transgenic chloroplasts.","Daniell, Henry; Lee, Seung-Bum; Panchal, Tanvi; Wiebe, Peter O.",Journal of Molecular Biology,142,20

Recently, the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination has been regarded as a potential candidate to explain this difference. Herein, we hypothesised that the past epidemic of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) may act as a latent explanatory factor for the worldwide differences seen in COVID-19 impact on mortality and incidence. We compared two indicators of past epidemic of M. tuberculosis, specifically, incidence (90 countries in 1990) and mortality (28 countries in 1950), with the mortality and incidence of COVID-19. We determined that an inverse relationship existed between the past epidemic indicators of M. tuberculosis and current COVID-19 impact. The rate ratio of the cumulative COVID-19 mortality per 1 million was 2.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09–6.68) per 1 unit decrease in the incidence rate of tuberculosis (per 100,000 people). The rate ratio of the cumulative COVID-19 incidence per 1 million was 2.07 (95% CI: 1.30–3.30). This association existed even after adjusting for potential confounders (rate of people aged 65 over, diabetes prevalence, the mortality rate from cardiovascular disease, and gross domestic product per capita), leading to an adjusted rate ratio of COVID-19 mortality of 2.44, (95% CI: 1.32–4.52) and a COVID-19 incidence of 1.31 (95% CI: 0.97–1.78). After latent infection, Mycobacterium survives in the human body and may continue to stimulate trained immunity. This study suggests a possible mechanism underlying the region-based variation in the COVID-19 impact.","Inoue, Kazuo; Kashima, Saori",PLoS One,142,16

RESULTS: A total of 40,206 tweets were collected from the Twitter public API stream that were geocoded from 2018 to 2019. Using data mining approaches, these tweets were then filtered for keywords associated with tobacco and ATP use behavior. This resulted in a subset of 5718 tweets, with 657 manually annotated and identified as associated with user-generated conversations about tobacco and ATP use behavior. The 657 tweets were coded into 9 parent codes: inquiry, interaction, observation, opinion, promote, reply, share knowledge, use characteristics, and transition of use behavior. The highest number of observations occurred under transition of use (43.38%, n = 285), followed by current use (39.27%, n = 258), opinions about use (0.07%, n = 46), and product promotion (0.06%, n = 37). Other codes had less than ten tweets that discussed these themes. Results provide early insights into how social media users discuss topics related to transition of use and their experiences with different and emerging tobacco product use behavior.","Bardier, Cortni; Yang, Joshua S.; Li, Jiawei; Mackey, Tim K.",BMC Res Notes,142,1

However, sharing experiences is the best way for countries to learn real‐time lessons and adapt to this rapidly changing pandemic. This commentary shares with the international community how an adaptive model of health system organization and responses helped Vietnam to break transmission of coronavirus. We find that an effective model is adaptive to time and context, and mobilizes and engages the wider society. We identify merging of different health system units into Center for Diseases Controls as a health system organization that saved massive resources. The early establishment of a formal committee responding to the pandemic helped unify every public health strategy. The mobilization of different stakeholders and communities added resources and facilitated a synchronous implementation of response strategies, even where those strategies involved significant personal or financial sacrifice. National training on Covid‐19 treatment for healthcare professionals across the entire hospital system was useful to expand the health service availability. Quickly published response guidelines helped to activate every level of the health system and involve every sector of society. A strategy of keeping high alert and preemptive action is also essential for coping with the pandemic.","Van Nguyen, Huy; Van Hoang, Minh; Dao, An Thi Minh; Nguyen, Hoa L.; Van Nguyen, Tien; Nguyen, Phuong The; Khuong, Long Quynh; Le, Phuong Mai; Gilmour, Stuart",Int J Health Plann Manage,142,16

METHODS: To determine the prevalence of EBV in the tonsils and adenoids of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) nationals and to provide a basis for understanding the origin and biology of EBV-infected cells, the immunophenotype of all EBV-infected cells in 46 tonsils and 46 adenoids was determined by EBER in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies to T cells (CD3), B cells (CD20), and epithelial cells (cytokeratin AE1/AE3), as well as immunostaining with antibodies to EBV latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1). RESULTS: EBV was found in 43% of tonsillectomy specimens and 15% of adenoidectomy specimens. All EBV-infected cells were found to be B lymphocytes. About 90% of the infected B cells are found in the interfollicular regions of tonsils and adenoids and the remaining 10% are found within the follicles. There is no significant association between EBV infection, age (P = 0.324) and gender (P = 0.442). CONCLUSION: EBV is associated with tonsillar hypertrophy and is prevalent in 43% of our cases. EBV is only detected in B lymphocytes and we believe that B lymphocytes are sites of primary infection and latency. In situ hybridization is the gold standard for the detection of EBV in tissue.","Al-Salam, Suhail; Dhaheri, Shamma Al; Awwad, Aktham; Daoud, Sayel; Shams, Ahmed; Ashari, Mouied Al",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,142,21

Global transcriptional profiling using oligonucleotide microarrays was therefore performed on liver biopsies from patients with cirrhosis caused by either chronic alcohol consumption or chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). RESULTS: Global gene expression patterns varied significantly depending upon etiology of liver disease, with a greater number of differentially regulated genes seen in HCV-infected patients. Many of the gene expression changes specifically observed in HCV-infected cirrhotic livers were expectedly associated with activation of the innate antiviral immune response. We also compared severity (CTP class) of cirrhosis for each etiology and identified gene expression patterns that differentiated ethanol-induced cirrhosis by class. CTP class A ethanol-cirrhotic livers showed unique expression patterns for genes implicated in the inflammatory response, including those related to macrophage activation and migration, as well as lipid metabolism and oxidative stress genes. CONCLUSION: Stages of liver cirrhosis could be differentiated based on gene expression patterns in ethanol-induced, but not HCV-induced, disease. In addition to genes specifically regulating the innate antiviral immune response, mechanisms responsible for differentiating chronic liver damage due to HCV or ethanol may be closely related to regulation of lipid metabolism and to effects of macrophage activation on deposition of extracellular matrix components.","Lederer, Sharon L; Walters, Kathie-Anne; Proll, Sean; Paeper, Bryan; Robinzon, Shahar; Boix, Loreto; Fausto, Nelson; Bruix, Jordi; Katze, Michael G",Virol J,142,2

This study which is a cross-sectional one gives the idea about awareness and alertness of dentists about COVID-19 in Kerala, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The survey comprised 25 closed-ended questions. The survey was separated into two sections. The initial segment of the poll was identified with the socio-segment qualities that were researched, while the subsequent part was worried about dental practitioners' perspectives toward the management of COVID-19 and the apparent danger of defilement in dental facilities. RESULTS: Coronavirus management in dental clinics differs regarding adherence to the rules. An aggregate of 750 respondents finished the form, out of which 686 (91.46%) complete reactions were incorporated. The majority of the respondents concurred on inquiries regarding the knowledge, practice, and mentality of dental specialists toward the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The feedback of most dental specialists with respect to the readiness and view of disease control measures against the COVID-19 pandemic was positive.

The use of this technology has been shown to improve outpatient glycemic outcomes and quality of life and oftentimes may be continued in the hospital setting. Our aim is to review the current guidelines and available evidence on the continuation of insulin pumps and CGMs in the inpatient setting. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with diabetes are at higher risk for hospitalizations and complications due to hyper- or hypoglycemia, metabolic co-morbidities, or as seen recently, more severe illness from infections such as SARS-CoV-2. The maintenance of euglycemia is important to decrease both morbidity and mortality in the hospital setting. There is consensus among experts and medical societies that inpatient use of diabetes technology in carefully selected patients with proper institutional protocols is safe and can improve inpatient glycemic outcomes and reduce hypoglycemia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, CGMs played a vital role in managing hyperglycemia in some hospitalized patients. SUMMARY: Insulin pumps and CGMs have the potential to transform glycemic management in hospitalized patients. In order for institutions to safely and effectively incorporate these technologies on their inpatient units, hospital-based providers will need to be able to understand how to manage and utilize these devices in their practice in conjunction with diabetes experts.","Yeh, Tiffany; Yeung, Michele; Mendelsohn Curanaj, Felicia A.",Curr Diab Rep,142,16

This study describes the epidemiology and the outcome of major trauma patients admitted to centers in France during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all consecutive trauma patients aged 15 years and older admitted into 15 centers contributing to the TraumaBase® registry during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France. This COVID-19 trauma cohort was compared to historical cohorts (2017–2019). RESULTS: Over a 4 years-study period, 5762 patients were admitted between the first week of February and mid-June. This cohort was split between patients admitted during the first 2020 pandemic wave in France (pandemic period, 1314 patients) and those admitted during the corresponding period in the three previous years (2017–2019, 4448 patients). Trauma patient demographics changed substantially during the pandemic especially during the lockdown period, with an observed reduction in both the absolute numbers and proportion exposed to road traffic accidents and subsequently admitted to traumacenters (348 annually 2017–2019 [55.4% of trauma admissions] vs 143 [36.8%] in 2020 p < 0.005). The in-hospital observed mortality and predicted mortality during the pandemic period were not different compared to the non-pandemic years. CONCLUSIONS: During this first wave of COVID-19 in France, and more specifically during lockdown there was a significant reduction of patients admitted to designated trauma centers. Despite the reallocation and reorganization of medical resources this reduction prevented the saturation of the trauma rescue chain and has allowed maintaining a high quality of care for trauma patients.

These pathways are typically regulated by antiviral proteins and can be constitutively expressed but also exacerbated by interferon induction. A myriad of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) have been identified in mounting broad-spectrum antiviral responses. Members of the interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) family of proteins are unique among these ISGs due to their ability to prevent virus entry through the lipid bilayer into the cell. In the current study, we generated transgenic chickens that constitutively and stably expressed chicken IFITM1 (chIFITM1) using the avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (RCAS)-based gene transfer system. The challenged transgenic chicks with clinical dose 10(4) egg infective dose 50 (EID(50)) of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 (clade 2.2.1.2) showed 100% protection and significant infection tolerance. Although challenged transgenic chicks displayed 60% protection against challenge with the sub-lethal dose (EID(50) 10(5)), the transgenic chicks showed delayed clinical symptoms, reduced virus shedding, and reduced histopathologic alterations compared to non-transgenic challenged control chickens. These finding indicate that the sterile defense against H5N1 HPAIV offered by the stable expression of chIFITM1 is inadequate; however, the clinical outcome can be substantially ameliorated. In conclusion, chIFITM proteins can inhibit influenza virus replication that can infect various host species and could be a crucial barrier against zoonotic infections.","Rohaim, Mohammed A.; Al-Natour, Mohammad Q.; Abdelsabour, Mohammed A.; El Naggar, Rania F.; Madbouly, Yahia M.; Ahmed, Kawkab A.; Munir, Muhammad",Int J Mol Sci,142,16

METHODS: In this systematic review, we searched the following databases from inception–May 2020 for original research articles with no language restrictions: Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Cochrane Library (Wiley), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate), CINAHL (EBSCO), and Social Work Abstracts (Ovid). This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019138817.

The impact of each law, policy, mandate, and directive since 1990 is briefly discussed, as are the limitations and risk of bias of each study. INTERPRETATION: Many punitive immigrant policies have decreased immigrant access to and utilization of basic healthcare services, while instilling fear, confusion, and anxiety in these communities.

METHODS: • A scoping overview - management and leadership policy context. • A systematic review of reviews of leadership in healthcare. • A systematic focused review of leadership in patient-facing dental practice. RESULTS: The healthcare literature mirrors the generic literature in relation to the temporal evolution of leadership theories. Policy papers influence healthcare literature, though these are generally written by independent bodies, link solely to medical publications, and are often commissioned from the grand strategic level thereby grounding them in a politicised system. The healthcare leadership literature offers few studies at the operational (patient care) level of leadership, with none of these focused explicitly on dentistry and dental practice. Numerous aims, definitions, models, conceptualisations, and links to theories of leadership are reported. The stage 1 literature demonstrates more contemporaneous ideas of leadership, while the dental practice literature is too often grounded in outdated concepts and theories. CONCLUSIONS: The overarching trend is from leaders to leadership; with no unified definition, model, theory, concept nor aim recognised. The fundamental importance of specific context and the reaction of others to leadership is reinforced. Leadership theories aligned to healthcare include Engaging, Authentic, Collective and the Transformational-Transactional continuum. Leadership is a dynamic, socially constructed process, only occurring in a group setting. Consisting of multiple moderating variables that demonstrate reciprocal influence on one another, these influences are neither equal nor stable. (246 words) CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Leadership is embedded in regulatory guidance and standards relating to general dental practice.

In this task, participants memorized the position of an object in a virtual room and then judged from a different perspective, whether the object has moved to the left or to the right. Results revealed that participants exhibited a systematic bias in their responses that we termed the reversed congruency effect. Specifically, they performed worse when the camera and the object moved in the same direction than when they moved in opposite directions. Notably, participants responded correctly in almost 100% of the incongruent trials, regardless of the distance by which the object was displaced. In Experiment 2, we showed that this effect cannot be explained by the movement of the object on the screen, but that it relates to the perspective shift and the movement of the object in the virtual world. We also showed that the presence of additional objects in the environment reduces the reversed congruency effect such that it no longer predicts performance. In Experiment 3, we showed that the reversed congruency effect is greater in older adults, suggesting that the quality of spatial memory and perspective-taking abilities are critical. Overall, our results suggest that this effect is driven by difficulties in the precise encoding of object locations in the environment and in understanding how perspective shifts affect the projected positions of the objects in the two-dimensional image.

Despite not having formal criteria for its diagnosis, COVID-19 associated cardiomyopathy has been observed in several studies through biomarkers and imaging. This study aims to estimate the proportion of COVID-19 patients with cardiac abnormalities and to determine the association between the cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients and disease severity and mortality. Observational studies published from December 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020 were obtained from electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI) and preprint servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv, ChinaXiv). Studies that have data on prevalence were included in the calculation of the pooled prevalence, while studies with comparison group were included in the calculation of the odds ratio. If multiple tests were done in the same study yielding different prevalence values, the largest one was used as the measure of prevalence of that particular study. Metafor using R software package version 4.0.2 was used for the meta-analysis. A total of 400 records were retrieved from database search, with 24 articles included in the final analysis. Pooled prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in 20 studies was calculated to be 0.31 [95% Confidence Intervals (CI) of (0.23; 0.41)], with statistically significant heterogeneity (percentage of variation or I-squared statistic I(2) = 97%, p < 0.01). Pooled analysis of 19 studies showed an overall odds ratio (OR) of 6.87 [95%-CI (3.92; 12.05)] for cardiac abnormalities associated with disease severity and mortality, with statistically significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 85%, between-study variance or tau-squared statistic τ(2) = 1.1485, p < 0.01). Due to the high uncertainty in the pooled prevalence of cardiac abnormalities and the unquantifiable magnitude of risk (although an increased risk is certain) for severity or mortality among COVID-19 patients, much more long-term prognostic studies are needed to check for the long-term complications of COVID-19 and formalize definitive criteria of “COVID-19 associated cardiomyopathy”.","Dy, Louie F.; Lintao, Ryan C.

However, the efficacy of Yoga has not been studied in chest trauma patients. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted at level-1 Trauma Centre. Isolated chest injury patients were randomized into either standard physiotherapy or Yogatherapy groups. Patients in physiotherapy group received conventional chest physiotherapy and Yogatherapy group received a set of Yogic exercises in addition to conventional chest physiotherapy. Primary outcome measure was changes in pulmonary function tests (PFT) at 4 weeks of discharge. Secondary outcomes were changes in quality of life (QoL), respiratory muscle strength and endurance, chest wall mobility, and levels of cytokines at 4 weeks. Data were analyzed using STATA v14.0. RESULTS: A total of 89 eligible patients were randomized to physiotherapy (n = 46) and Yoga therapy (n = 43) groups. Demographic characteristics were comparable in both the groups.

The clinically-proven protease inhibitor Camostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the virus-activating host cell protease TMPRSS2. However, antiviral activity of Camostat mesylate metabolites and potential viral resistance have not been analyzed. Moreover, antiviral activity of Camostat mesylate in human lung tissue remains to be demonstrated. METHODS: We used recombinant TMPRSS2, reporter particles bearing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 or authentic SARS-CoV-2 to assess inhibition of TMPRSS2 and viral entry, respectively, by Camostat mesylate and its metabolite GBPA. FINDINGS: We show that several TMPRSS2-related proteases activate SARS-CoV-2 and that two, TMPRSS11D and TMPRSS13, are robustly expressed in the upper respiratory tract. However, entry mediated by these proteases was blocked by Camostat mesylate. The Camostat metabolite GBPA inhibited recombinant TMPRSS2 with reduced efficiency as compared to Camostat mesylate. In contrast, both inhibitors exhibited similar antiviral activity and this correlated with the rapid conversion of Camostat mesylate into GBPA in the presence of serum. Finally, Camostat mesylate and GBPA blocked SARS-CoV-2 spread in human lung tissue ex vivo and the related protease inhibitor Nafamostat mesylate exerted augmented antiviral activity. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can use TMPRSS2 and closely related proteases for spread in the upper respiratory tract and that spread in the human lung can be blocked by Camostat mesylate and its metabolite GBPA.

The PDDA surface was constructed by electrostatic adsorption of the polyelectrolyte onto a monolayer of 11‐mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA). Poly‐l‐lysine was also adsorbed onto the MUA monolayer and compared with the PDDA surface in the capacity of mumps virus immobilization. The PDDA surface showed a higher adsorption of mumps virus than the poly‐l‐lysine surface. The SPR signal caused by the virus binding onto the PDDA surface was proportional to the concentration of mumps virus from 0.5 × 10(5) to 14 × 10(5) pfu/mL. The surface structure of the virus arrays was visualized by atomic force microscopy. Then, a dose‐dependent increase in the SPR signal was observed when various concentrations of the antimumps virus antibody in buffer or human serum were applied to the virus arrays, and their interaction was specific. Thus, it is likely that the spectral SPR biosensor based on the cationic polyelectrolyte surface may provide an efficient system for a high‐throughput analysis of intact virus and serodiagnosis of infectious diseases.","Kim, Hyun‐Soo; Jung, Se‐Hui; Kim, Sang‐Hyun; Suh, In‐Bum; Kim, Woo Jin; Jung, Jae‐Wan; Yuk, Jong seol; Kim, Young‐Myeong; Ha, Kwon‐Soo",Proteomics,142,16

In April 2020 a 25-year-old UK doctor exhibited classical COVID-19 symptoms, including fevers, headaches, and fatigue. A COVID-19 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) at the time returned negative. However, a follow-up antibody test in May 2020 returned positive. In October 2020 the same individual exhibited coryzal symptoms and headaches. He was COVID-19 NAAT tested and found to be positive. There was exposure to high viral load prior to reinfection. Overall the second infection was symptomatically milder, with a faster recovery.

Few biomarkers have been identified but, unfortunately, these are individually poorly specific, and novel biomarkers are needed to better predict patient outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of circulating platelets (PLT)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as biomarkers for Sars-Cov-2 infection, by setting a rapid and reliable test on unmanipulated blood samples. PLT-EVs were quantified by flow cytometry on two independent cohorts of Sars-CoV-2+ (n = 69), Sars-Cov-2− (n = 62) hospitalized patients, and healthy controls. Diagnostic performance of PLT-EVs was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. PLT-EVs count were higher in Sars-Cov-2+ compared to Sars-Cov-2− patients or HC. ROC analysis of the combined cohorts showed an AUC = 0.79 and an optimal cut-off value of 1472 EVs/μL, with 75% sensitivity and 74% specificity.

It is mainly performed in high-income countries but its implementation in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is increasing. However, no aggregate data exist regarding the outcomes of this procedure in resource-limited settings. We retrospectively reviewed all cases of laparoscopy recorded from January 2007 to March 2017 at the Department of Surgery of Beira to assess the related outcomes. Moreover, we performed a systematic review of the laparoscopic practices and outcomes in low-income countries. Data from the Department of Surgery of Beira identified 363 laparoscopic procedures, mainly relating to gynecological diseases, cholelithiasis, and appendicectomy with only a 1.6% complication rate (6 cases) and a 1.9% conversion rate (7 cases) to open surgery. The systematic review showed a pooled risk of overall complications significantly lower in laparoscopic vs. open appendicectomy (OR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.19–0.97; I(2) = 85.7%) and a significantly lower risk of infection (OR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.43–0.65; I(2) = 0.00%). The pooled SMD in operation duration in laparoscopic vs. open appendectomy was 0.58 (95% CI −0.00; 1.15; I(2) = 96.52), while the pooled SMD in hospitalization days was −1.35 (95% CI −1.87; −0.82; I(2) = 96.41). Laparoscopy is an expensive procedure to adopt as it requires new equipment and specialized trained health workers. However, it could reduce post-operative costs and complications, especially in terms of infections.

The early detection of infected individuals is a pre-requisite to contain the virus. Currently, purification of RNA from patient samples followed by RT-PCR is the gold standard to assess the presence of this single-strand RNA virus. However, these procedures are time consuming, require continuous supply of specialized reagents, and are prohibitively expensive in resource-poor settings. Here, we report an improved nucleic-acid-based approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 with the ability to detect as little as five viral genome equivalents. The approach delivers results without the need to purify RNA, reduces handling steps, minimizes costs, and allows evaluation by non-specialized equipment. The use of unprocessed swap samples is enabled by employing a heat-stable RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, which performs the double task of stringent reverse transcription of RNA at elevated temperatures as well as PCR amplification of a SARS-CoV-2 specific target gene. As results are obtained within 2 hours and can be read-out by a hand-held LED-screen, this novel protocol will be of particular importance for large-scale virus surveillance in economically constrained settings.","Kuiper, Johannes W.

We found that the Gaussian and Student-t copulas are best at fitting the structure dependence between markets. Also, these copulas suggest that under normal market conditions, Bitcoin might act as a hedge asset against the stock price movements of all international markets analyzed. However, the dependence on the Shanghai and Hong Kong markets was somewhat higher. Also, under extreme market conditions, the role of Bitcoin might change from hedge to diversifier. In a time-varying copula analysis, given by the Student-t copula, we found that even under normal market conditions, for some markets, the role of Bitcoin as a hedge asset might fail on a high number of days.","Garcia-Jorcano, Laura; Muela, Sonia Benito",Research in international business and finance,142,17

The answer to this question will obviously depend very much on the duration in time over which the trend has been defined, as well as the smoothing technique that has been used. As an estimate of the short-time rate of change we propose to employ a very simple and robust definition of the trend based on a centered 1-year sliding data window for averaging and a corresponding centered 1-year difference (2-year data window) to estimate its rate of change. In this paper, we show that this simple strategy applied to weekly data of the Keeling curve (1974–2020) gives an estimated rate of change which is perfectly consistent with a more sophisticated regression analysis technique based on Taylor and Fourier series expansions. From a statistical analysis of the regression model and by using the Cramér–Rao lower bound, it is demonstrated that the relative error in the estimated rate of change is less than 5 [Formula: see text] .

METHODS AND ANALYSIS Interventional and non-interventional studies comparing the effect of CR, for at least 1 month, on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes including fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, revascularisation and rehospitalisation in adults with cardiac diseases will be deemed eligible for inclusion. Studies published between 1990 and 2020 will be searched in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, Scopus and in registries for randomised controlled trials. Eligible studies will be selected using the Covidence software, and their salient details regarding the design, population, tested interventions and outcomes of interest will be gathered. The quality of studies to be deemed eligible and reviewed will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's tools. The appraisal process will be based on the study design (interventional and non-interventional). In the meta-analysis step, the pooled effect of CR on the outcomes will be estimated. All meta-analyses will be done using the random-effects model approach (inverse-variance method). I 2 and p value of χ2 statistics will guide the heterogeneity assessment. Subgroup analyses will also be performed. The small study effect will be investigated by generating the funnel plots. The symmetry of the latter will be tested by performing Egger's test.

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of abnormal liver tests on admission of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS & METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study including 1611 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from April 15, 2020 through July 31, 2020 in 38 different Hospitals from 11 Latin American countries. We registered clinical and laboratory parameters, including liver function tests, on admission and during hospitalization. All patients were followed until discharge or death. We fit multivariable logistic regression models, further post-estimation effect through margins and inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: Overall, 57.8% of the patients were male with a mean age of 52.3 years, 8.5% had chronic liver disease and 3.4% had cirrhosis. Abnormal liver tests on admission were present on 45.2% (CI 42.7–47.7) of the cohort (n = 726). Overall, 15.1% (CI 13.4–16.9) of patients died (n = 244). Patients with abnormal liver tests on admission presented higher mortality 18.7% (CI 15.9–21.7), compared to those with normal liver biochemistries 12.2% (CI 10.1–14.6); P < .0001). After excluding patients with history of chronic liver disease, abnormal liver tests on admission were independently associated with death [OR 1.5 (CI 1.1–2.0); P = 0.01], and severe COVID-19 (2.6 [2.0–3.3], P < .0001), both adjusted by age, gender, diabetes, pneumonia and body mass index >30. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of abnormal liver tests on admission is independently associated with mortality and severe COVID-19 in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection and may be used as surrogate marker of inflammation.

Here, we demonstrate that the repeating protein subunit pattern common to most virus capsids is a molecular pattern that induces a Toll-like-receptor-2 (TLR2)-dependent antiviral immune response. This early antiviral immune response regulates the clearance of subsequent bacterial superinfections, which are a primary cause of morbidities associated with influenza virus infections. Utilizing this altered susceptibility to subsequent bacterial challenge as an outcome, we determined that multiple unrelated, empty, and replication-deficient capsids initiated early TLR2-dependent immune responses, similar to intact influenza virus or murine pneumovirus. These TLR2-mediated responses driven by the capsid were not dependent upon the capsid’s shape, size, origin, or amino acid sequence. However, they were dependent upon the multisubunit arrangement of the capsid proteins, because unlike intact capsids, individual capsid subunits did not enhance bacterial clearance. Further, we demonstrated that even a linear microfilament protein built from repeating protein subunits (F-actin), but not its monomer (G-actin), induced similar kinetics of subsequent bacterial clearance as did virus capsid. However, although capsids and F-actin induced similar bacterial clearance, in macrophages they required distinct TLR2 heterodimers for this response (TLR2/6 or TLR2/1, respectively) and different phagocyte populations were involved in the execution of these responses in vivo. Our results demonstrate that TLR2 responds to invading viral particles that are composed of repeating protein subunits, indicating that this common architecture of virus capsids is a previously unrecognized molecular pattern.","Shepardson, Kelly M.; Schwarz, Benjamin; Larson, Kyle; Morton, Rachelle V.; Avera, John; McCoy, Kimberly; Caffrey, Alayna; Harmsen, Ann; Douglas, Trevor; Rynda-Apple, Agnieszka",mBio,142,16

Through an unbiased, reporter-based high-throughput compound screen, we identified merafloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibacterial, as a −1 PRF inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2. Frameshift inhibition by merafloxacin is robust to mutations within the pseudoknot region and is similarly effective on −1 PRF of other beta coronaviruses.

By ensuring beneficiaries’ bills are paid while supporting their self-determination, this structural intervention may mitigate the effects of economic disadvantage to improve housing and financial stability, enabling self-efficacy for health outcomes and improved antiretroviral therapy adherence. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of CCRP on marginalized people living with HIV (PLWH). We hypothesize that helping participants to pay their rent and other bills on time will improve housing stability and decrease financial stress. METHODS: PLWH (n = 160) receiving services at community-based organizations will be randomly assigned to the CCRP intervention or the standard of care for 12 months. Fifty additional participants will be enrolled into a non-randomized (“choice”) study allowing participant selection of the CCRP intervention or control. The primary outcome is HIV medication adherence, assessed via the CASE adherence index, viral load, and CD4 counts. Self-assessment data for ART adherence, housing instability, self-efficacy for health behaviors, financial stress, and retention in care will be collected at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Viral load, CD4, and appointment adherence data will be collected at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months from medical records. Outcomes will be compared by treatment group in the randomized trial, in the non-randomized cohort, and in the combined cohort. Qualitative data will be collected from study participants, eligible non-participants, and providers to explore underlying mechanisms of adherence, subjective responses to the intervention, and implementation barriers and facilitators. DISCUSSION: The aim of this study is to determine if CCRP improves health outcomes for vulnerable PLWH. Study outcomes may provide information about supports needed to help economically fragile PLWH improve health outcomes and ultimately improve HIV health disparities. In addition, findings may help to refine service delivery including the provision of representative payee to this often-marginalized population.

Because it is acquired via respiratory droplets, community spread is responsible for the recent global crisis. The current diagnostic options include real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and a few serology tests, including but not limited to the recently approved five minutes serology tests. The disease presents as a lower respiratory tract illness. Anecdotal experiences have shown that imaging characteristics are crucial to diagnosis as radiological evidence of disease appears prior to clinical manifestations and tends to evolve over time, which can be useful in predicting the stage of the disease. CT scan is more sensitive than a chest X-ray in highlighting these changes.","Fatima, Sahar; Ratnani, Iqbal; Husain, Maha; Surani, Salim",Cureus,142,22

COVID-19-related ARDS is subject to a mortality rate of 50% and prolonged period of mechanical ventilation, with no specific pharmacological treatment currently available (Infection au nouveau Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19, France et Monde. https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/dossiers/coronavirus-covid-19). Because of its immunomodulatory action, we propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration in patients developing COVID-19-related ARDS. METHODS: The trial is a phase III double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel group, concurrent, controlled study in hospitalized participants with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation using a sequential design. Participants in the treatment group will receive infusions of polyvalent immunoglobulin for 4 consecutive days, and the placebo group will receive an equivalent volume of sodium chloride 0.9% for the same duration. The primary outcome is the number of ventilator-free days up to the 28th day. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of IVIG on (1) organ failure according to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at 14 and 28 days, (2) lung injury score at 14 and 28 days, (3) the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events of IVIG, (4) length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, (5) length of hospital stay, (6) functional outcomes at day 90 defined by the activities of daily living and instrumental activities of the daily living scales, and (7) 90-day survival. One hundred thirty-eight subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to IVIG or placebo groups (69 in each group), considering 90% power, alpha level 0.05 (two sides), and 0.67 effect size level. DISCUSSION: The ICAR trial investigates the effect of IVIG in COVID-19-related ARDS. We expect an increase in the survival rate and a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation, which is associated with significant morbidity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT 2020-001570-30.

Although the first approved vaccines were already administered by the end of 2020, worldwide vaccine availability is still limited. Moreover, immune escape variants of the virus are emerging against which the current vaccines may confer only limited protection. Further, existing antivirals and treatment options against COVID-19 only show limited efficacy. Influenza A virus (IAV) defective interfering particles (DIPs) were previously proposed not only for antiviral treatment of the influenza disease but also for pan-specific treatment of interferon (IFN)-sensitive respiratory virus infections. To investigate the applicability of IAV DIPs as an antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19, we conducted in vitro co-infection experiments with cell culture-derived DIPs and the IFN-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 in human lung cells. We show that treatment with IAV DIPs leads to complete abrogation of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Moreover, this inhibitory effect was dependent on janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. Further, our results suggest boosting of IFN-induced antiviral activity by IAV DIPs as a major contributor in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus, we propose IAV DIPs as an effective antiviral agent for treatment of COVID-19, and potentially also for suppressing the replication of new variants of SARS-CoV-2.","Rand, U.; Kupke, S.Y.; Shkarlet, H.; Hein, M.D.; Hirsch, T.; Marichal-Gallardo, P.; Cicin-Sain, L.; Reichl, U.; Bruder, D.",bioRxiv,142,32

But this area is yet to be explored. Hence, we aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) regarding personal protective equipment (PPE) among healthcare workers, along with a survey of the possible determinants. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, online and offline surveys were conducted among a sample of 393 healthcare workers from five different districts of Bangladesh. A validated self-administered questionnaire comprising five sections (socio-demography, work-related information, knowledge, attitude, and practice) was used for data collection. Multivariate stepwise forward logistic regression was applied to find significant factors associated with good attitude, and practice using SPSS version 25. RESULTS: The average age of the 393 participants was 28.9±5.2 years with a male-female ratio of one. Of them, 99.5% (n=391) had good knowledge, 88.8% (n=349) had positive attitude and 51.7% (n=203) had good practice regarding PPE. Results revealed that being a physician and living at home were significantly associated with a positive attitude. While being a non-physician, having lower education, working in private hospitals, and using office transport were associated with good practice regarding PPE. CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrated that the healthcare workers had an overall good knowledge and a positive attitude but a poor practice regarding PPE. This study also highlighted the factors influencing KAP towards PPE that must be addressed in future education, awareness, and counseling programs.","Hossain, Mohammad Ali; Rashid, Md Utba Bin; Khan, Md Abdullah Saeed; Sayeed, Sabrina; Kader, Md Abdul; Hawlader, Mohammad Delwer Hossain",J Multidiscip Healthc,142,2

Its clinical relevance lies in the size of the tumor since larger masses cause pregnancy complications, including an unfavorable neonatal outcome. Case presentation: We report the case of a 34-year-old second gravida and nullipara at the 35th week of gestation, admitted to the gynecological department for antibiotic-resistant fever. The cardiotocography performed during hospitalization showed an abnormal fetal pattern. A 2250 g newborn was delivered by cesarean section. No complications were observed during childbirth and postpartum was insignificant. On gross inspection a white fleshy intraparenchymal mass blooming on the maternal surface was noted; routinely stained sections revealed features consistent with chorioangioma with vascular channels lined by inconspicuous endothelial cells immunoreactive for CD31 and CD133. Focal expression of CD133 was also observed in placental villi. Discussion: CD133 expression indicated the presence of stem cells in chorioangioma, suggesting their possible role in the development of mesenchymal lesions including chorioangioma.","Di Massa, Gianluca; Stabile, Guglielmo; Romano, Federico; Balduit, Andrea; Mangogna, Alessandro; Belmonte, Beatrice; Canu, Pina; Bertucci, Emma; Ricci, Giuseppe; Salviato, Tiziana",Medicina (Kaunas),142,33
