183866,Research preparedness paves the way to respond to pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus.,2009,"Through the lens of an adapted Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, I have analyzed (1) the impact of the three main educational reforms of the 20th and 21st centuries on culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD)and low-socioeconomic (SES)students in the core subjects up to the COVID-19 pandemic;(2) the efficacy of current classroom assessment practices, and (3) a brief reimagining of how changing equity standards in teaching and assessment post-COVID-19 could aid in CLD and low-SES students achieving a higher self-esteem level. I contend that student success, or self-esteem, can only be achieved by first satisfying the needs at the lower hierarchy levels. By analyzing CLD and SES students’ school experiences, educators and policy-makers can extrapolate the requirements for inclusive, rigorous, and responsive assessments that recognize students’ needs and utilize their cultural and linguistic diversity. As states begin the shift from remote learning back to face-to-face in the fall, more significant considerations of CLD and low-SES students must be ensured.","Ansorger, Jennifer",Education Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci11080376,938
186132,The costs and consequences of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection treatments in Canada.,2004,"Ever since the use of interferon-γ to treat patients with multiple sclerosis resulted in enhanced disease, the role of IFN-γ in demyelinatlon has been under question. To address this issue directly, transgenic mice were generated that expressed the cDNA of murlne IFN-γ in the central nervous system by using an oligodendrocyte-specific promoter. Expression of the transgene occurred after 8 weeks of age, at which time the murlne immune and central nervous systems are both fully developed. Directly associated with transgene expression, primary demyelination occurred and was accompanied by clinical abnormalities consistent with CNS disorders. Additionally, multiple hallmarks of immune-mediated CNS disease were observed including upregulation of MHC molecules, gliosis and lymphocytlc infiltration. These results demonstrate a direct role for IFN-γ as an Inducer of CNS demyellnatlon leading to disease and provide new opportunities for dissecting the mechanism of demyelinatlon.","Horwitz, Marc S.; Evans, Claire F.; Mcgavern, Dorian B.; Rodriguez, Moses; Oldstone, Michael B.A.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5321678/,938

188301,A near-fatal infection with oseltamivir-resistant seasonal influenza A in a previously healthy child: Case report.,2009,"This study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of coronary arterial profiles from normal dogs (11 animals) and canines (six dogs) with experimental myocardial infarction (MI) induced by ligation of the left coronary artery (LCA). Blood velocity of the LCA and right coronary artery (RCA) were evaluated following transthoracic pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography. The LCA was observed as an infundibular shape, located adjacent to the sinus of Valsalva. The RCA appeared as a tubular structure located 12 o'clock relative to the aorta. In normal dogs, the LCA and RCA mean peak diastolic velocities were 20.84 ± 3.24 and 19.47 ± 2.67 cm/sec, respectively. The LCA and RCA mean diastolic deceleration times were 0.91 ± 0.14 sec and 1.13 ± 0.20 sec, respectively. In dogs with MI, the LCA had significantly (p < 0.01) lower peak velocities (14.82 ± 1.61 cm/sec) than the RCA (31.61 ± 2.34 cm/sec). The RCA had a significantly (p < 0.01) rapid diastolic deceleration time (0.71 ± 0.06 sec) than that found in the LCA (1.02 ± 0.22 sec) of MI dogs. In conclusion, these profiles may serve as a differential factor for evaluating cardiomyopathy in dogs.","Park, Nohwon; Kim, Jaehwan; Lee, Miyoung; Lee, Soyun; Song, Sunhye; Lee, Seungjun; Kim, Soyoung; Park, Yangwoo; Eom, Kidong",Journal of veterinary science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23820197/,938
188704,Innovation and challenges in funding rapid research responses to emerging infectious diseases: Lessons learned from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome.,2004,"OBJECTIVE To determine what risk factors, other than genetic predisposition, contribute to the incidence of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in private breeding catteries and animal shelters. DESIGN Cats from 7 catteries and a shelter were observed monthly for 1 year. At each visit, cats were examined, fecal samples were collected for determination of feline coronavirus shedding, and blood samples were collected for determination of coronavirus antibody titers. Diagnostic tests were performed on all cats that died of FIP. ANIMALS 275 purebred or random-bred cats that were kept by private breeder-owners in homes. RESULTS 24 cats died of FIP during the study. Development of FIP was not associated with cattery, mean cat number, mean age, sex, cattery median coronavirus antibody titer, husbandry and quarantine practices, caging and breeding practices, or prevalence of concurrent diseases. However, risk factors for FIP included individual cat age individual cat coronavirus titer, overall frequency of fecal coronarvirus shedding, and the proportion of cats in the cattery that were chronic coronavirus shedders. Deaths from FIP were more frequent in fall and winter, and on the basis of analysis of cattery records, the number of deaths varied yearly. Epidemics (> 10% mortality rate) were reported at least once in 5 years in 4 catteries. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Elimination of FIP from a cattery is only possible by total elimination of endemic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) infection. The most important procedure to reduce FECV from catteries is elimination of chronic FECV shedders.","Foley, J E; Poland, A; Carlson, J; Pedersen, N C",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9143536/,938

195665,The impact of requiring completion of an online infection control course on health professionals' intentions to comply with infection control guidelines: A comparative study.,2009,"The role of viral respiratory tract infections in acute exacerbations of asthma was studied prospectively in 31 patients with atopic asthma aged 15-56 years. Patients recorded symptom scores for asthma and peak expiratory flow rate daily for 11 months. In addition, they reported for detailed clinical, functional, and virological study every four weeks and as soon as possible after the onset of worsening asthma or symptoms suggesting a respiratory tract infection. Thirty viral identifications were made, of which 18 (60%) were associated with an exacerbation of asthma. Viral respiratory tract infection was identified in 18 (10%) of the 178 exacerbations of asthma, and in 10 (36%) of the 28 severe exacerbations. The frequency of viral identifications in 16 non-asthmatic, control subjects during the same period was similar. It is concluded that viral respiratory tract infections may cause or be associated with exacerbations of asthma in adults, and that they are an important factor in severe exacerbations.","Beasley, R; Coleman, E D; Hermon, Y; Holst, P E; O'Donnell, T V; Tobias, M",Thorax,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3194873/,938
195874,The role of torovirus in nosocomial viral gastroenteritis at a large tertiary pediatric centre.,2012,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV. The disease has a high propensity to spread to household members and healthcare workers and may be associated with transmission and outbreaks in the community. Severe illness in immunocompromised patients, sophisticated hospital facilities and treatment procedures, particularly those that generate aerosols, and lack of adequate isolation and control measures, can amplify transmission and contribute to so-called ""super-spreading"" events. The presence of non-specific clinical manifestations at presentation and a lack of validated early diagnostic methods and effective management pose great difficulty for frontline physicians in the containment of this disease. The mortality of SARS is in the region of 10 to 15%; the presence of underlying disease, high initial C-reactive protein levels, and positive SARS-CoV in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples are associated with a higher risk of respiratory failure and mortality. Despite the disappearance of SARS cases worldwide, the potential evolution of SARS-CoV in animals suggests the disease may re-emerge in the future. Heightened levels of clinical suspicion, rapid case detection and isolation, and contact tracing are essential to effective management of future outbreaks. Further ongoing requirements for successful management include research on the immunopathogenesis of SARS and the development of timely and reliable diagnostic tests, effective antiviral and immunomodulatory agents, and vaccines for the disease.","Hsueh, Po-Ren; Yang, Pan-Chyr",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14976561/,938
273148,Facilitating student involvement in physics learning through worksheets assisted by augmented reality during the covid-19 pandemic: Analysis of teacher perceptions,2021,"AIMS: We hypothesized that glycemic control in outpatients, measured by HbA1c, was worse during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic than in 2019. We sought to quantify how much worse and to determine if social determinants of health were associated with these differences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were extracted from the electronic medical records of 2 cohorts of patients seen in the family medicine clinic of a southeastern academic health center. Three hundred patients with baseline HbA1c results as well as HbA1c results in May 2019 or May 2020 were evaluated. RESULTS: The groups had similar mean baseline HbA1c (7.65, SD = 1.50 for 2019; 7.61, SD = 1.71 for 2020; P = .85). Mean May HbA1c decreased from baseline in 2019 (7.19, SD = 1.45) but rose in 2020 (7.63, SD = 1.73), a statistically significant difference (P < .01). Controlling for age, gender, race, and insurance status, HbA1c in May 2020 (meanadj = 7.73) was significantly higher than in May 2019 (meanadj = 7.16). CONCLUSIONS: During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, glycemic control in our patient population was significantly worse than during the same period in 2019 (mean HbA1c difference = 0.57). Contrary to our expectations, we did not find associations between patient demographic variables and glycemic control, including race.","Ledford, C J W; Roberts, C; Whisenant, E; Walters, C; Akamiro, K; Butler, J; Ali, A; Seehusen, D A",J Am Board Fam Med,,938
294696,A Case Study on Mathematics Instructional Implementation: Teacher's Perspective on How Mathematics Teachers Face the Pandemic Covid-19 Situation,2021,"OBJECTIVE: This study investigated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies, using the Abbott antinucleocapsid IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) assay, in five prespecified healthcare worker (HCW) subgroups following the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING: An 800-bed tertiary-level teaching hospital in the south of Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: Serum was collected for anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG using the Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG CMIA qualitative assay, as per the manufacturer's specifications.The groups were as follows: (1) HCWs who had real-time PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 infection (>1-month postpositive RT-PCR); (2) HCWs identified as close contacts of persons with COVID-19 infection and who subsequently developed symptoms (virus not detected by RT-PCR on oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swab); (3) HCWs identified as close contacts of COVID-19 cases and who remained asymptomatic (not screened by RT-PCR); (4) HCWs not included in the aforementioned groups working in areas determined as high-risk clinical areas; and (5) HCWs not included in the aforementioned groups working in areas determined as low-risk clinical areas. RESULTS: Six of 404 (1.49%) HCWs not previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection (groups 2-5) were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of recruitment into the study.Out of the 99 participants in group 1, 72 had detectable IgG to SARS-CoV-2 on laboratory testing (73%). Antibody positivity correlated with shorter length of time between RT-PCR positivity and antibody testing.Quantification cycle value on RT-PCR was not found to be correlated with antibody positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs who had not previously tested RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 was low compared with similar studies.","Faller, Eamonn; Wyse, Adrianne; Barry, Rachel; Conlon, Kevin; Everard, Cormac; Finnegan, Paula; Foran, Claire; Herlihy, Emer; Kerr, Gerry; Lapthorne, Susan; McGreal-Bellone, Aimee; Morrissey, Edmond; O039,; Sullivan, Deirdre; Sullivan, Grainne; Eustace, Joseph A; Spillane, Declan; Dempsey, Catherine; Benson, John; Prentice, Mike; Gallagher, John; MacSharry, John; Fanning, Liam J; Riordan, Stephen; Horgan, Mary; Sadlier, Corinna",BMJ Open,,938
318921,Vector Error Correction Model to Forecasting Spot Prices for Coffee Commodities during Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 predisposes patients to secondary infections; however, a better understanding of the impact of coinfections on the outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients is still necessary. AIM: To analyse death risk due to coinfections in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We evaluated the Odds of death of 212 severely ill COVID-19 patients, with detailed focus on the risks for each pathogen, site of infection, comorbidities and length of hospitalization. FINDINGS: The mortality rate was 50.47%. Fungal and/or bacterial isolation occurred in 89 patients, of which 83.14% died. Coinfected patients stayed hospitalized longer and had an increased Odds of dying (OR = 13.45, R2=0.31). The risk of death was increased by bacterial (OR=11.28) and fungal (OR=5.97) coinfections, with increased levels of creatinine, leukocytes, urea and C-reactive protein. Coinfections increased the risk of death if patients suffer from cardiovascular disease (OR= 11.53), diabetes (OR=6.00) or obesity (OR=5.60) in comparison with patients with these comorbidities but without pathogen isolation. The increased risk of death was detected for negative-coagulase Staphylococcus (OR=25.39), Candida non-albicans (OR=11.12), S. aureus (OR=10.72), Acinetobacter spp. (OR=6.88), Pseudomonas spp. (OR=4.77) and C. albicans (OR=3.97). The high-risk sites of infection were blood, tracheal aspirate and urine. Patients with coinfection undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation were 3.8 times more likely to die than those without positive cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Severe COVID-19 patients with secondary coinfections required longer hospitalization and had higher risk of death. The early diagnosis of coinfections is essential to identify high-risk patients and to determine the right interventions to reduce mortality.","Silva, Danielle L; Lima, Caroline M; Magalhães, Vanessa C R; Baltazar, Ludmila M; Peres, Nalu T A; Caligiorne, Rachel B; Moura, Alexandre S; Fereguetti, Tatiani; Martins, Juliana C; Rabelo, Lívia F; Abrahão, Jônatas S; Lyon, Ana C; Johann, Susana; Santos, Daniel A",J. hosp. infect,,938

456409,Recovering Infrastructure Public-Private Partnership Projects as Effective «epinomic» Policy in Fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was announced as an outbreak by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020 and as a pandemic in March 2020. The majority of infected individuals have experienced no or only mild symptoms, ranging from fully asymptomatic cases to mild pneumonic disease. However, a minority of infected individuals develop severe respiratory symptoms. The objective of this study was to identify susceptible HLA alleles and clinical markers that can be used in risk prediction model for the early identification of severe COVID-19 among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A total of 137 patients with mild COVID-19 (mCOVID-19) and 53 patients with severe COVID-19 (sCOVID-19) were recruited from the Center Hospital of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM), Tokyo, Japan for the period of February-August 2020. High-resolution sequencing-based typing for eight HLA genes was performed using next-generation sequencing. In the HLA association studies, HLA-A*11:01:01:01 [Pc = 0.013, OR = 2.26 (1.27-3.91)] and HLA-C*12:02:02:01-HLA-B*52:01:01:02 [Pc = 0.020, OR = 2.25 (1.24-3.92)] were found to be significantly associated with the severity of COVID-19. After multivariate analysis controlling for other confounding factors and comorbidities, HLA-A*11:01:01:01 [P = 3.34E-03, OR = 3.41 (1.50-7.73)], age at diagnosis [P = 1.29E-02, OR = 1.04 (1.01-1.07)] and sex at birth [P = 8.88E-03, OR = 2.92 (1.31-6.54)] remained significant. The area under the curve of the risk prediction model utilizing HLA-A*11:01:01:01, age at diagnosis, and sex at birth was 0.772, with sensitivity of 0.715 and specificity of 0.717. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article that describes associations of HLA alleles with COVID-19 at the 4-field (highest) resolution level. Early identification of potential sCOVID-19 could help clinicians prioritize medical utility and significantly decrease mortality from COVID-19.","Khor, Seik-Soon; Omae, Yosuke; Nishida, Nao; Sugiyama, Masaya; Kinoshita, Noriko; Suzuki, Tetsuya; Suzuki, Michiyo; Suzuki, Satoshi; Izumi, Shinyu; Hojo, Masayuki; Ohmagari, Norio; Mizokami, Masashi; Tokunaga, Katsushi",Front Immunol,,938
