6615,Neuraminidaseremmers voor de behandeling van influenza,2006,"Nucleic acid-based therapeutics present huge potential in the treatment of pulmonary diseases ranging from lung cancer to asthma and chronic pulmonary diseases, which are often fatal and widely prevalent. The susceptibility of nucleic acids to degradation and the complex structure of lungs retard the effective pulmonary delivery of nucleic acid drug. To overcome these barriers, different strategies have been exploited to increase the delivery efficiency using chemically synthesized nucleic acids, vector encapsulation, proper formulation, and administration route. However, several limitations regarding off-target effects and immune stimulation of nucleic acid drugs hamper their translation into the clinical practice. Therefore, their successful clinical application will ultimately rely on well-developed carriers and methods to ensure safety and efficacy. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the nucleic acid application for pulmonary diseases, covering action mechanism of the nucleic acid drugs, the novel delivery systems, and the current formulation for the administration to lungs. The latest advances of nucleic acid drugs under clinical evaluation to treat pulmonary disorders will also be detailed.","Chen, Jing; Tang, Yue; Liu, Yun; Dou, Yushun",AAPS PharmSciTech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101845/,512

Although diagnostic clinical pathology has not been viewed as practical for the rodent patient, current advances in technology make processing of small samples possible. Cultivation of the technical skills necessary for rodent sample collection has the potential to improve the standard of rodent veterinary care. This article provides an overview of rodent sample collection techniques, hematology, clinical biochemistry, serology, and clinical pathology of other tissues and fluids for laboratory rodents. General principles of clinical pathology can be applied across species. This article emphasizes the subtleties of the different rodent species which may impact diagnostic interpretation.","McClure, Diane E.",Vet Clin North Am Exot Anim Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110626/,512
7695,Assistance par circulation extracorporelle veinoveineuse dans le traitement du syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë : rationnel et objectifs cliniques,2014-04-01,"The DA virus is a neurotropic murine virus which can induce acute encephalomyelitis in suckling mice and a chronic myelopathy in weanlings. The agent has been attenuated by serial passage in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells. When attenuated virus is inoculated in 8-week-old C(3)HeJ mice a myelopathy of delayed onset with prominent demyelination of lateral and anterior columns occurs. The DA virus is believed to be related to the Theiler murine encephalomyelitis (TME) viruses because of the similar clinical and pathological conditions which it causes, and because neutralization tests indicate shared antigens between it and GD7, a TME virus. This paper reports electron-microscopic studies of BHK-21 cells infected with DA virus. The cells were prepared 24 and 48 hr after inoculation. Cytopathic effects were observed and infected cells contained plaques consisting of numerous 25 nm virus particles in crystalline array. The virions were exclusively intracytoplasmic and were morphologically indistinguishable from human poliomyelitis virus. These observations appear to establish DA as a picorna virus, related to the TME virus group. The chronic myelopathy caused by DA may prove relevant to chronic demyelinative myelopathies in man, such as multiple sclerosis, and also to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","Powell, H.C.; Lehrich, J.R.; Arnason, B.G.",J Neurol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7118415/,512

Rubella virus infection is systemic in nature and the accompanying symptoms are generally benign, the most pronounced being a mild rash of short duration. The most common complication of rubella virus infection is transient joint involvement such as polyarthralgia and arthritis. The primary health impact of rubella virus is that it is a teratogenic agent. The vaccination strategy is aimed at elimination of rubella and includes both universal vaccination of infants at 15 months of age with the trivalent measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and specific targeting with the rubella vaccine of seronegative women planning pregnancy and seronegative adults who could come in contact with women of childbearing age, although it is recommended that any individual over the age of 12 months without evidence of natural infection or vaccination be vaccinated. Medically, the current challenge posed by rubella virus is to achieve complete vaccination coverage to prevent resurgences.","Frey, Teryl K.",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131582/,512

9499,Protocolo diagnóstico-terapéutico del síndrome febril de corta duración en el paciente ambulatorio,2013-04-03,"Antibody neutralization of cytomegalovirus (CMV) entry into diverse cell types is a key consideration for development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics. CMV entry into fibroblasts differs significantly from entry into epithelial or endothelial cells: fibroblast entry is mediated by gB and gH/gL/gO, whereas both epithelial and endothelial cell entry require an additional pentameric complex (PC) comprised of gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131A. Because PC-specific antibodies in CMV-seropositive human sera do not affect fibroblast entry but potently block entry into epithelial or endothelial cells, substantially higher neutralizing potencies for CMV-positive sera are observed when assayed using epithelial cells as targets than when using fibroblasts. That certain sera exhibit similar discordances between neutralizing potencies measured using epithelial vs. endothelial cells (Gerna G. et al.J Gen Virol, 89:853–865, 2008) suggested that additional mechanistic differences may also exist between epithelial and endothelial cell entry. To further explore this issue, neutralizing potencies using epithelial and endothelial cells were simultaneously determined for eight CMV-positive human sera, CMV-hyperimmune globulin, and a panel of monoclonal or anti-peptide antibodies targeting specific epitopes in gB, gH, gH/gL, or the PC. No significant differences were observed between epithelial and endothelial neutralizing potencies of epitope-specific antibodies, CMV-hyperimmune globulin, or seven of the eight human sera. However, one human serum exhibited a six-fold higher potency for neutralizing entry into epithelial cells vs. endothelial cells. These results suggest that epitopes exist that are important for epithelial entry but are less critical, or perhaps dispensable, for endothelial cell entry. Their existence should be considered when developing monoclonal antibody therapies or subunit vaccines representing limited epitopes.","Qi, Ying; He, Li; Cui, Xiaohong; Hertel, Laura; Freed, Daniel C.; Fu, Tong-Ming; Kauvar, Lawrence M.; McVoy, Michael A.; Ruan, Qiang",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7144056/,512

The major importance of these proteins in the pathogenesis and outcome of infectious diseases has been clearly demonstrated. In humans, there is increasing evidence that the host's cytokine response is genetically determined and that the genetic variability of cytokines underlies the complexity of interindividual differences in the immune response to micro organism invasions. We review the influence of host cytokine gene on the susceptibility to and the severity of parasitic, bacterial and viral infections. Proinflammatory cytokine polymorphisms are discussed in detail because of their importance in the course of severe infections such as meningococcal disease, cerebral malaria and septic shock. Genetic variants of the IL-10 gene, an antiinflammatory cytokine appear to be responsible for an uncontrolled and intense CARS and may have also dramatic consequences as an overwhelming inflammatory response. Our greater understanding of the genetic factors that influence mortality and morbidity of infectious diseases will permit identification of genomic markers which may be required for risk stratification of patients targeted for novel immunomodulatory treatments helping clinicians to select the most appropriate treatment options for their patients.","Chiche, Jean-Daniel; Siami, Shidasp; Dhainaut, Jean-FrançDois; Mira, Jean-Paul",Sepsis (Boston),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7144473/,512

15970,Enfoque «Pit Crew» en el soporte vital en el trauma prehospitalario,2021-03-02,"Multiple studies have been performed to identify the most common ethical dilemmas encountered by ethics consultation services. However, limited data exists comparing the content of ethics consultations requested by specific hospital specialties. It remains unclear whether the scope of ethical dilemmas prompting an ethics consultation differ between specialties and if there are types of ethics consultations that are more or less frequently called based on the specialty initiating the ethics consult. This study retrospectively assessed the incidence and content of ethics consultations called by surgical vs. non-surgical specialties between January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2018 using our RedCap Database and information collected through the EMR via our Clinical and Translational Science Center. 548 total ethics consultations were analyzed (surgical n = 135, non-surgical n = 413). Our results demonstrate that more surgical consults originated from the ICU, as opposed to lower acuity units (45.9% vs. 14.3%, p ≤ 0.001), and surgical patients were more likely to have a DNR in place (37.5% vs. 22.2%, p = 0.002). Surgical specialties were more likely to call about issues relating to withholding/withdrawing life-sustaining treatment (p ≤ 0.001), while non-surgical specialties were more likely to call about issues related to discharge planning (p = 0.001). There appear to be morally relevant differences between consults classified as the “same” that are not entirely captured by the usual ethics consultations classification system. In conclusion, this study highlights the unique ethical issues experienced by surgical vs. non-surgical specialties. Ultimately, our data can help ethics consultation services determine how best to educate various hospital specialties to approach ethical issues commonly experienced within their field.","Meredyth, Nicole A.; Fins, Joseph J.; de Melo-Martin, Inmaculada",HEC Forum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7934986/,512

18088,Les provinces et territoires du Canada devraient publier des données sur le cannabis pour soutenir la recherche,2021-05-25,"Vancomycin plus piperacillin–tazobactam (VPT) is a commonly used antimicrobial regimen for septic patients. VPT is more nephrotoxic than other regimens such as vancomycin plus cefepime (VC) when given over several days. This risk of nephrotoxicity is less clear when VPT is given for initial empiric therapy in sepsis and de-escalated quickly based on evolving clinical information. The objective of this study was to assess nephrotoxicity among septic patients empirically treated with either VPT or VC at initial clinical presentation. We conducted a retrospective study of septic patients who received VPT or VC within 12 h of presentation to the emergency department. The primary outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI) and renal recovery 72 h after presentation. For the total of 418 patients, 306 received VPT and 112 received VC. Rates of AKI at 72 h were 15.2% for VPT patients and 11.0% for VC patients [p = 0.44]. Among patients with AKI at presentation, 16.3% of VPT patients had AKI at 72 h compared to 8.9% of VC patients [p = 0.19]. Among those without AKI at presentation, 14.2% VPT patients and 16.7% VC patients had AKI at 72 h [p = 0.71]. Renal recovery rates for patients with AKI at presentation were 42.3% for VPT patients versus 40.3% for VC patients [p = 0.78]. In-hospital renal replacement therapy occurred in 6.2% VPT patients and 0.9% VC patients [p = 0.024]. Therefore, initial empiric therapy with VPT in sepsis may not confer increased risk of AKI when de-escalated appropriately.","Elliott, Brian Pacca; Tang, Michael M; Madden, Joshua Alexander; Markert, Ronald James; Burdette, Steven Dale; Pleiman, Craig Matthew; Speelmon, Emily Claire",Intern Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8178657/,512

Thus, we identified all cases of 5 major tumor surgery procedures in Germany from the DRG (diagnosis-related group) database of the Federal Statistical Office (prostatectomy, cystectomy, renal tumor surgery, retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy, penis surgery) from 2006–2013 (or 2016) by database query and investigated the influences of technical innovations, as well as guideline changes on the developments of case numbers. In addition, we analyzed the correlations between annual case numbers and perioperative outcomes. The results showed a clear correlation between case volume (and thus expertise) of a hospital and an improved perioperative outcome. Nevertheless, there is hardly any tendency towards centralization in these uro-oncological interventions. The development in the number of cases seems to depend more on the effect of advertising by means of technical innovations or the regional relation of the patients to a certain clinic. In the past, centrally controlled attempts to introduce minimum case numbers or voluntary certification of centers had little influence on the distribution of case numbers.","Groeben, C.; Koch, R.; Baunacke, M.; Flegar, L.; Borkowetz, A.; Thomas, C.; Huber, J.",Urologe A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8420844/,512

For this purpose, clinical and patient-reported outcomes, the course of the disease, and applied therapies are observed. Methods: TREATgermany recruits patients with moderate-to-severe AD according to the diagnostic criteria of the UK Working Party, an “Objective Scoring for Atopic Dermatitis” (oSCORAD) > 20 and/or currently antiinflammatory systemic treatment for AD or previous anti-inflammatory systemic treatment for AD within past 24 months before inclusion. No study related interventions will be performed. Currently, 59 dermatological practices, clinics, and university hospitals are participating in TREATgermany (as of May 2021). Based on the interim analysis of October 13, 2020, patient characteristics were described from 4,373 documented visits of adult participants (n = 1,025). Results: The mean age at inclusion in TREATgermany was 42 years, 57.7% of patients were men (n = 591) and 42.3% were women (n = 434). According to oSCORAD, 85.8% of those included suffered from moderate-to-severe AD. At baseline visit, 744 patients had already received one or more systemic treatments for AD (glucocorticosteroids n = 600, ciclosporin A (CSA) n = 307, dupilumab n = 98). 597 patients received dupilumab during their participation in TREATgermany, 134 patients received CSA. Conclusion: With the increasing number of recruitment centers (October 2020: 38 centers; May 2021: 59 centers), TREATgermany can continue to make an important contribution to health services research for patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The registry fulfills the methodological requirements of IQWiG for the collection and processing of healthcare-related data. With the successful and expected approval of further systemic treatments, these can be compared in terms of efficacy and safety in the future. In addition, with the recruitment of children and adolescents started in 2021, this patient group can also be observed.","Siegels, Doreen; Haufe, Eva; Heinrich, Luise; Werfel, Thomas; Weidinger, Stephan; Schmitt, Jochen",Allergol Select,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8439109/,512

These facets may permit novel methods to emerge to supplement, refine, or replace the routine methods. We have suggested a framework for risk assessment to assure biosafety in vaccines and suggested quantitative modeling to help crystallize thinking about the place of testing, either routine or novel, in this assurance. We assert that testing for adventitious agents should not be the sole basis on which product biosafety is assured. Appropriate sourcing and quality control of raw and starting materials, adherence to principles of Good Manufacturing Practices, including environmental and personnel monitoring and process validation, and finally, testing as verification are the package needed for maximal assurance of biosafety. Thus, a pathway forward to a new paradigm for adventitious agent testing exists in which detection of a broader array of potential adventitious agents might be included in the testing, with adequate sensitivity to provide the needed assurance of verification that there has been no catastrophic breach, in the context of the overall process, design, and adherence to cGMP. Furthermore, it is our hope that we may be able to implement the 3 Rs policy to reduce, replace, and/or refine the use of animals in product safety testing, at the same time that we provide greater assurance of the biosafety of vaccines.","Sheets, Rebecca L.; Duncan, Paul A.","Vaccine Analysis: Strategies, Principles, and Control",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122056/,512

However, recent research on extracellular vesicles provides new insights into pathogenesis, prognosis, and potential therapeutic options for ARDS. Extracellular vesicles are membrane-bound anuclear structures which constitute a recently recognized and important intercellular communication mechanism, allowing targeted transfer of diverse biologic cargo between different cell types. There is new evidence that extracellular vesicles play an important role in the pathogenesis of ARDS and also potentially a protective role. In this chapter, we highlight recent translational and clinical studies that have advanced our understanding of the critical role extracellular vesicles play in both inducing and attenuating inflammatory lung injury in ARDS.

As sanitization of such logs is an unsolved research problem, commercial Web search engines that possess large datasets of this kind at their disposal refrain from disseminating them to the wider research community. Ironically, studies examining privacy in search often require detailed search logs with user profiles. This paper builds on an observation that information needs are also expressed in the form of questions in online Community Question Answering (CQA) communities. We take a step towards understanding the process of formulating queries from questions to form a basis for automatic derivation of search logs from CQA forums. Specifically, we sample natural language (NL) questions spanning diverse themes from the StackExchange platform, and conduct a large-scale conversion experiment where crowdworkers submit search queries they would use when looking for equivalent information. We also release a dataset of 7,000 question-query pairs from our study.","Biega, Asia J.; Schmidt, Jana; Roy, Rishiraj Saha",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148029/,512

ChEMU involves two key information extraction tasks over chemical reactions from patents. Task 1—Named entity recognition—involves identifying chemical compounds as well as their types in context, i.e., to assign the label of a chemical compound according to the role which the compound plays within a chemical reaction. Task 2—Event extraction over chemical reactions—involves event trigger detection and argument recognition. We briefly present the motivations and goals of the ChEMU tasks, as well as resources and evaluation methodology.","Nguyen, Dat Quoc; Zhai, Zenan; Yoshikawa, Hiyori; Fang, Biaoyan; Druckenbrodt, Christian; Thorne, Camilo; Hoessel, Ralph; Akhondi, Saber A.; Cohn, Trevor; Baldwin, Timothy; Verspoor, Karin",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148043/,512

29129,Welke maatregelen zijn er voor pedicures: Ondersteuning tijdens de coronacrisis,2020-04-07,"It is increasingly evident that China has attached more attention to discursive power in foreign policy since the early 21st century. Both top leaders and government agencies have been active in advocating for a new discourse on various international occasions. Previously, China has been reluctant to join the debate in international affairs, and been instead preoccupied with domestic affairs since the late 1970s. The situation has changed since 2009 because of China’s rapid rise to become the world’s second largest economy. With regard to the motivations behind the Chinese government’s support for discursive power, the dominant explanation is based on the “rise of China” argument. However, this argument does not explain the causal relationship between China’s rise and its discursive power strategy. So, this paper aims to clarify the motivation behind China’s discursive power strategy through document reviews and interviews with mainstream scholars. It concludes that a discursive power strategy has been the fundamental principle of the Communist Party of China since its establishment in 1921. Since China’s adoption of an opening-up policy in 1978, this tradition has been suppressed but not eliminated entirely by top leaders. As China continues to rise on the world stage, the principle will drive China to create a new political model rather than be a mere follower of the established political order.","Zhao, Kejin",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149103/,512

However, in practice, the negative samples of training data are usually selected from an unannotated conversation data set at random. The generated training data is likely to contain noise and affect the performance of the response selection models. To address this difficulty, we consider utilizing the underlying correlation in the data resource itself to derive different kinds of supervision signals and reduce the influence of noisy data. More specially, we consider a main-complementary task pair. The main task (i.e., our focus) selects the correct response given the last utterance and context, and the complementary task selects the last utterance given the response and context. The key point is that the output of the complementary task is used to set instance weights for the main task. We conduct extensive experiments in two public datasets and obtain significant improvement in both datasets. We also investigate the variant of our approach in multiple aspects, and the results have verified the effectiveness of our approach.","Zhou, Kun; Zhao, Wayne Xin; Zhu, Yutao; Wen, Ji-Rong; Yu, Jingsong",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206249/,512

Besides a consensus recommendation by multi-national epilepsy specialists, the situation of the epilepsy management during the pandemic has seldom been reported. METHODS: The China Association Against Epilepsy carried out an online nationwide survey among its board members in April 2020. One hundred and thirty board members from 22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions, and 4 municipalities across China responded to the questionnaires. They reported the situation of clinical practice and gave opinions on the management of people with epilepsy between January 13th and March 31st, 2020, a time period concentrated with confirmed COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: The proportions of patients consulting through telephone or online (88.4%) and of patients with regular case review (93.9%) were highest in the high-risk area, as reported by the responders. The patients in the high-risk area were more likely to have increased episodes of seizures (17.7%), aggravated psychological disorders (30.2%), and less accessibility to anti-seizure medications (ASMs) (77.2%). Regular ASMs supply (74.6%), medical consultation (69.2%), and psychological aids (29.2%) were urgently needed for people with epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the most common dilemma faced by people with epilepsy in policy circumstances during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. The opinions raised by Chinese epileptologists may provide reference for epilepsy care in other countries.

42482,Les urgences digestives sont profondément impactées et plus graves durant la pandémie de COVID-19,2020-11-24,"The interplay between cellular stress and immune response can be variable and sometimes contradictory. The mechanisms by which stress-activated pathways regulate the inflammatory response to a pathogen, in autoimmunity or during cancer progression remain unclear in many aspects, despite our recent knowledge of the signalling and transcriptional pathways involved in these diseases. In this context, over the last decade many studies demonstrated that cholesterol metabolism is an important checkpoint for immune homeostasis and cancer progression. Indeed, cholesterol is actively metabolized and can regulate, through its mobilization and/or production of active derivatives, many aspects of immunity and inflammation. Moreover, accumulation of cholesterol has been described in cancer cells, indicating metabolic addiction. The nuclear receptors liver-X-receptors (LXRs) are important regulators of intracellular cholesterol and lipids homeostasis. They have also key regulatory roles in immune response, as they can regulate inflammation, innate and adaptive immunity. Moreover, activation of LXRs has been reported to affect the proliferation and survival of different cancer cell types that show altered metabolic pathways and accumulation of cholesterol. In this minireview we will give an overview of the recent understandings about the mechanisms through which LXRs regulate inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer, and the therapeutic potential for future treatment of these diseases through modulation of cholesterol metabolism.","Bilotta, Maria Teresa; Petillo, Sara; Santoni, Angela; Cippitelli, Marco",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7670053/,512

METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study conducted at a tertiary critical care center in urban Kyoto, Japan. Adult emergency patients hospitalized between January 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020, were recruited. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors’ hospital began restricted visitation on March 28, 2020. This study defined before visitation restriction as January 1, 2019, through March 31, 2020, and after visitation restriction as April 1, 2020, through June 30, 2020. We did not restrict emergency services, and there were no changes in the hospital’s routine, except for visitation restrictions. The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for delirium incidence was calculated to compare the before and after visitation restriction periods, and the logistic model was used to adjust for seven variables: age, sex, ward type on admission, primary diagnosis, ventilator management, general anesthesia surgery, and dementia. RESULTS: Study participants were 6264 patients, median age 74 years (56–83), and 3303 men (52.7%). The total delirium incidence in entire research period was 2.5% (158 of 6264 patients), comprising 1.8% (95/5251) before visitation restriction and 6.2% (63/1013) after visitation restriction. The AOR for delirium incidence was 3.79 (95% CI, 2.70–5.31) after visitation restriction versus before visitation restriction. Subgroup analysis showed no apparent interaction for delirium incidence. CONCLUSION: Visitation restriction was associated with an increased incidence of delirium in emergency inpatients.","Kandori, Kenji; Okada, Yohei; Ishii, Wataru; Narumiya, Hiromichi; Maebayashi, Yoshiro; Iizuka, Ryoji",J Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7719735/,512
43005,Hoe Heerlen de sociaaleconomische problemen aanpakt,2020-12-11,"BACKGROUND: Microaspiration of gastric and oropharyngeal secretions is the main causative mechanism of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a routine investigation tool in intensive care unit and could enhance microaspiration. This study aimed at evaluating the impact of TEE on microaspiration and VAP in intubated critically ill adult patients. METHODS: It is a four-center prospective observational study. Microaspiration biomarkers (pepsin and salivary amylase) concentrations were quantitatively measured on tracheal aspirates drawn before and after TEE. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with TEE-associated microaspiration, defined as: (1) ≥ 50% increase in biomarker concentration between pre-TEE and post-TEE samples, and (2) a significant post-TEE biomarker concentration (> 200 μg/L for pepsin and/or > 1685 IU/L for salivary amylase). Secondary endpoints included the development of VAP within three days after TEE and the evolution of tracheal cuff pressure throughout TEE. RESULTS: We enrolled 100 patients (35 females), with a median age of 64 (53–72) years. Of the 74 patients analyzed for biomarkers, 17 (23%) got TEE-associated microaspiration. However, overall, pepsin and salivary amylase levels were not significantly different between before and after TEE, with wide interindividual variability. VAP occurred in 19 patients (19%) within 3 days following TEE. VAP patients had a larger tracheal tube size and endured more attempts of TEE probe introduction than their counterparts but showed similar aspiration biomarker concentrations. TEE induced an increase in tracheal cuff pressure, especially during insertion and removal of the probe. CONCLUSIONS: We could not find any association between TEE-associated microaspiration and the development of VAP during the three days following TEE in intubated critically ill patients. However, our study cannot formally rule out a role for TEE because of the high rate of VAP observed after TEE and the limitations of our methods.","Bagate, François; Rouzé, Anahita; Zerimech, Farid; Boissier, Florence; Labbe, Vincent; Razazi, Keyvan; Carteaux, Guillaume; de Prost, Nicolas; Balduyck, Malika; Maboudou, Patrice; Nseir, Saad; Mekontso Dessap, Armand",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7719845/,512

We test whether TFP is determined by the so-called “capital misallocation effects, scale effects, and labor market effects”. By considering aggregate data, over the period 1983–2017, we employ dynamic panel cointegration techniques to identify the long-run component of TFP. We get two main results. First, the interest rate, the real compensation and the real exchange rate have a positive impact on TFP. Then, the incidence of temporary employment (a proxy of labor market flexibility) has a negative effect on TFP. Moreover, for robustness, we run a panel VECM to check for causalities among the variables. Notably, this further excercise confirms the existence of a strong and positive long-run relationship between TFP and prices. We conclude that coordinated policies on the issue of interest rate, exchange rate, labour cost and regulation, may allow to reassemble the productivity slowdown puzzle and strengthen the European economic structure.","Bellocchi, Alessandro; Sanchez Carrera, Edgar J.; Travaglini, Giuseppe",Econ Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7819773/,512

57397,De impact van corona op jeugdigen met ASS,2021-09-10,"Costa Rica has long been a country of special interest in the Americas and in global health because of its good health. The United Nations Development Programme ranks countries according to their level of human development based on life expectancy, education and national income. Although Costa Rica is ranked at 63 and classified as ‘High’, in terms of health it belongs in the ‘Very High’ group. In 2018 mean life expectancy for the ‘Very High’ countries was 79.5, while in Costa Rica it was 80. In 2018, under five mortality was 8.8/1000 live births, lower than countries ranked in the ‘Very High’ human development group. Expected years of schooling in Costa Rica is 15.4, closer to the average, 16.4 years, of the ‘Very High’ human development group than the average of the ‘High’ group. The country is much healthier than would be predicted by its national income; rather, other features of society’s development are likely to have played a key role in the development of good health. These include (i) the decision to cease investment in national defence, which freed up money to invest in health, education and the welfare of the population; (ii) the decision to create a universal health system financed by the State, employers and workers in the 1940s; and (iii) the educational system, that generated opportunities to lift important sectors of the population out of poverty, allowing them to have basic sanitary conditions that increase their possibilities to live longer and in better conditions. Despite these advances, inequalities in terms of income and social conditions persist, presenting challenges in the field of health, particularly for lower-income populations and those of African and indigenous descent. These inequalities must be addressed using decisions based on scientific evidence, a greater use of disaggregated data to reveal progress in addressing these inequalities, and with a broader articulation of the health sector with policies that act on the social determinants of health.","Campbell Barr, Epsy; Marmot, Michael",Rev Panam Salud Publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8407602/,512
58806,"Adverse Effects of the COVID-19 Vaccine Reported by Lecturers and Staff of Kabul University of Medical Sciences, Kabul, Afghanistan",2021-10-02,"The suggestion that we “are at war” with the coronavirus pandemic was not uncommon in national representations of the challenge posed by the virus. Such a representation was in turn frequently linked to the imperative of emergency responses, including expanded police powers, national lockdowns, and border closures. For theorists of securitization, this is not surprising. For them, the language of security and existential threat enables extraordinary and exceptional practices. This paper interrogates these assumptions about the performative and enabling role of securitizing language by beginning with emergency measures and asking how these were justified, how they became possible, and how prominent the language of “security” was to this politics of exceptionalism. It examines justifications for emergency responses—national lockdown and/or border closures—in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand in March 2020. Ultimately, the cases examined demonstrate significant variability in justifications for similar extreme measures. In the process, this analysis challenges core assumptions about the conditions in which extraordinary measures become possible, suggesting, in turn, the need for a context-specific understanding of both securitization and the conditions of exceptionalism.","Kirk, Jessica; McDonald, Matt",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8499991/,512
62095,[The first Hungarian patient with Guillain-Barre syndrome after COVID-19].,2021-01-30,"BACKGROUND & AIMS Marginal ulceration, or ulceration at the gastrojejunal anastomosis, is a common complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Acidity likely contributes to the pathophysiology, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) frequently are prescribed for treatment. However, patients with gastric bypass only have a small gastric pouch and rapid small-bowel transit, which limits the opportunity for capsule breakdown and PPI absorption. Soluble PPIs (open capsules [OCs]) might be absorbed more easily than intact capsules (ICs). We compared time to ulcer healing, number of endoscopic procedures, and use of health care for patients with marginal ulceration who received PPIs in OC vs IC form. METHODS We performed a retrospective study of 164 patients diagnosed with marginal ulceration who underwent RYGB at the Brigham and Women's Hospital from 2000 through 2015. Patients received high-dose PPIs and underwent repeat endoscopy every 3 months until ulcer healing was confirmed. We used time-to-event analysis with a Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate the association between mode of PPI administration and time to ulcer healing, in addition to Cox multivariate regression analysis. Total charge (procedural and maintenance) was determined by comparison of categorized charges incurred from time of ulcer diagnosis to resolution. The primary outcome was time to healing of marginal ulceration in RYGB patients receiving high-dose PPIs in OC vs IC form. RESULTS A total of 162 patients were included (115 received OC and 49 received IC). All patients were followed up until ulcer healing was confirmed. The median time to ulcer healing was 91.0 days for the OC group vs 342.0 days for the IC group (P < .001). OC was the only independent predictor of time to ulcer healing (P < .001) when we controlled for known risk factors. The number of endoscopic procedures (P = .02) and overall health care utilization (P = .05) were lower in the OC than the IC group. CONCLUSIONS Patients with marginal ulceration after RYGB who receive OC PPIs have shorter ulcer healing times, fewer endoscopic procedures, and use less health care resources compared with patients who receive IC PPIs. Given these results and the high prevalence of marginal ulceration in this patient population, the use of OC PPIs is a low-risk, low-cost alternative that should be considered.","Schulman, Allison R; Chan, Walter W; Devery, Aiofe; Ryan, Michele B; Thompson, Christopher C",Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2016.10.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27773764/,512

We evaluated the prevalence of COVID-19 infection at the time of reentry and cardiopulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 in elite athletes. All athletes returning to a USOPTF were required to go through a reentry protocol consisting of an electronic health history, a 6-day quarantine including twice-daily symptom surveys, COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction and antibody testing, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, and pulmonary function testing. Athletes with current or prior COVID-19 infection also underwent an echocardiogram, cardiology consultation, and additional testing as indicated. All athletes followed rigorous infection prevention measures and minimized contact with the outside community following reentry. At the time of this report, 301 athletes completed the reentry protocol among which 14 (4.7%) tested positive for active (positive polymerase chain reaction test, n = 3) or prior (positive antibody test, n = 11) COVID-19 infection. During the study period, this cohort accrued 14,916 days living and training at USOPTFs. Only one (0.3%) athlete was subsequently diagnosed with a new COVID-19 infection. No cardiopulmonary pathology attributable to COVID-19 was detected. Our findings suggest that residential elite athlete training facilities can successfully resume activity during the COVID-19 pandemic when strict reentry and infection prevention measures are followed. Dissemination of our reentry quarantine and screening protocols with COVID-19 mitigation measures may assist the global sports and medical community develop best practices for reopening of similar training centers.","Shah, Ankit B; Nabhan, Dustin; Chapman, Robert; Chiampas, George; Drezner, Jonathan; Olin, J Tod; Taylor, David; Finnoff, Jonathan T; Baggish, Aaron L",Sports health,https://doi.org/10.1177/19417381211002761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709838/,512

The ability of predatory bacteria to reduce bacterial burden in vivo within the lungs of rats has been demonstrated, but it was unknown if predatory bacteria can attenuate systemic bacterial burden administered intravenously. In this study, we first assessed the safety of intravenous inoculation of predatory bacteria in rats. No rat morbidity or adverse histopathology of various organs due to predatory bacteria administration was observed. An increase in proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα and KC/GRO) was observed at two hours post-inoculation; however, cytokines returned to baseline levels by 18 hours. Furthermore, bacterial dissemination analysis demonstrated that predatory bacteria were efficiently cleared from the host by 20 days post-injection. To determine whether predatory bacteria could reduce bacterial burden in vivo, Klebsiella pneumoniae was injected into the tail veins of rats and followed with multiple doses of predatory bacteria over 16 or 24 hours. Predatory bacteria were unable to significantly reduce K. pneumoniae burden in the blood or prevent dissemination to other organs. The results suggest that predatory bacteria may not be effective for treatment of acute blood infections.","Shatzkes, Kenneth; Singleton, Eric; Tang, Chi; Zuena, Michael; Shukla, Sean; Gupta, Shilpi; Dharani, Sonal; Rinaggio, Joseph; Kadouri, Daniel E; Connell, Nancy D",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-02041-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28500337/,512

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this real-life study, we retrospectively examined a database of 90 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis treated with brodalumab (210 mg, s.c.) and followed for 1 year. Disease severity and treatment response were assessed by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at baseline and after 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks. Predictors of a PASI response were evaluated by logistic regression. RESULTS After 48 weeks, 92.2% of patients (mean age 50.2±15 years) treated with brodalumab achieved a PASI score of <3. Furthermore, PASI score decreased from 17.4±10.3 at baseline to 1.7±3.9 and 1.4±3.7 at 12 and 24 weeks, and PASI 75, 90, and 100 response was achieved in 87.3%, 81.8%, and 72.7% of patients respectively at 48 weeks.Univariate regression analysis revealed that previous exposure to anti-IL17A treatment was associated with poorer PASI response between 36-48 weeks. In a range of specific difficult-to-treat cases previously having failed with other biologics, brodalumab significantly improved outcome, leading to complete remission. CONCLUSION Brodalumab was observed to be effective and safe in patients with moderate-severe chronic psoriasis in a real world-setting.","Galluzzo, M; Caldarola, G; De Simone, C; Bernardini, N; Moretta, G; Pallotta, S; Botti, E; Campione, E; Pirro, F; Potenza, C; Bianchi, L; Peris, K",Expert opinion on biological therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14712598.2021.1941862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114515/,512
122938,Obesity and binge alcohol intake are deadly combination to induce steatohepatitis: A model of high-fat diet and binge ethanol intake.,2020-09-17,"OBJECTIVE A pandemic afflicts the entire world. The highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and rapidly spread across the entire globe. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)has infected more than two million people worldwide, causing over 160,000 deaths. Patients with COVID-19 disease present with a wide array of symptoms, ranging from mild flu-like complaints to life threatening pulmonary and cardiac complications. Older people and patients with underlying disease have an increased risk of developing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) requiring mechanical ventilation. Once intubated, mortality increases exponentially. A number of pharmacologic regimens, including hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin, antiviral therapy (eg, remdesevir), and anti-IL-6 agents (e.g., toclizumab), have been highlighted by investigators over the course of the pandemic, based on the therapy's potential to interrupt the viral life-cycle of SARS-CoV-2 or preventing cytokine storm. At present, there have been no conclusive series of reproducible randomised clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of any one drug or therapy for COVID-19. CASES COVID-19 positive patients (n=5) at a single institution received hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) between 13 and 20 April 2020. All the patients had tachypnoea and low oxygen saturation despite receiving high FiO2. HBOT was added to prevent the need for mechanical ventilation. A standard dive profile of 2.0ATA for 90 minutes was employed. Patients received between one and six treatments in one of two dedicated monoplace hyperbaric chambers. RESULTS All the patients recovered without the need for mechanical ventilation. Following HBOT, oxygen saturation increased, tachypnoea resolved and inflammatory markers fell. At the time of writing, three of the five patients have been discharged from the hospital and two remain in stable condition. CONCLUSION This small sample of patients exhibited dramatic improvement with HBOT. Most importantly, HBOT potentially prevented the need for mechanical ventilation. Larger studies are likely to define the role of HBOT in the treatment of this novel disease.","Thibodeaux, Kerry; Speyrer, Marcus; Raza, Amer; Yaakov, Raphael; Serena, Thomas E",Journal of wound care,https://doi.org/10.12968/jowc.2020.29.sup5a.s4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412891/,512

PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 2,960 patients (1,755 males, 1,205 females; mean age: 39.6 years; range, 1 to 98 years) with orthopedic fractures were included in the study: 552 patients during the pandemic period (March 10th and July 1st, 2020) and 1,158 control patients in the same period 2019 and 1,250 control patients in 2018. Epidemiological characteristics, injury mechanisms, fracture locations and treatment details of the patients were analyzed and compared between 2018, 2019 and 2020 for adult and pediatric populations. RESULTS Of a total of 552 patients, 485 were adults and 67 were pediatric patients. In the control groups, of 1,158 patients (2019), 770 were adults and 378 were pediatric patients and, of 1,250 patients (2018), 857 were adults and 393 were pediatric patients. The proportion of proximal femur and hand fractures significantly increased during the pandemic period (p=0.025 and p=0.038, respectively). The most frequent surgical indication in the pandemic period was proximal femoral fracture. The proportion of home accidents as an injury mechanism significantly increased in the pandemic period compared to 2018 and 2019 (48.5% vs. 18.6% and 20.6%, respectively; p=0.000). The proportion of female pediatric patients significantly increased during the pandemic period compared to 2018 and 2019 (44.8% vs. 25.4% and 27.2%, respectively, p=0.004). The proportion of forearm fractures (p=0.001) also increased, and the proportion of tibia-fibula fractures (p=0.03) decreased. The most frequent surgical indication in pediatric patients was distal humeral fracture in both groups. CONCLUSION During the pandemic period, proximal femoral fractures in the elderly remained a concern. In-home preventative strategies may be beneficial to reduce the incidence of hip fractures in the elderly.","Oguzkaya, Sinan; Misir, Abdulhamit; Ozcamdalli, Mustafa; Eken, Gokay; Kizkapan, Turan Bilge; Kurk, Muhammed Bilal; Uzun, Erdal",Joint diseases and related surgery,https://doi.org/10.52312/jdrs.2021.20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34145807/,512

Three measures were to enforce the reporting of HCWs with unknown fever, acute respiratory illness, and other symptoms; to conduct ongoing surveillance to obtain early warning of potential contagion exposure; and to perform epidemiological investigation and outbreak management. A 17-week surveillance data were collected, 374 (6.17%) HCWs with unknown fever or acute respiratory infection symptoms detected by online body temperature surveillance system were reported, there were no cases of nosocomial infection of COVID-19 among HCWs. Via contact tracing and reporting system, 133 (2.19%) HCWs reported footprints in different epidemic events, but no HCWs were infected. No onward transmission to HCWs occurred after containment measures were formulated. Integrated measures of surveillance, managing epidemic transmission chain, and encouraging individual responsibility have been effective approaches among HCWs in the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. Despite the absence of ongoing local transmission, vigilance and compliance must be maintained to prevent spread of health care-associated infections in all areas and in social mingling among HCWs outside hospitals. These 3 methodical measures secured HCWs' health and safety successfully and preserved health care delivery continuously.","Chen, Huang-Chi; Chen, Mei-Hsing; Shen, Chun-Wei; Hsieh, Meng-Hsuan; Wu, Lin-Kun; Chen, Li-Chin; Cheng, Tsun-Jen; Chen, Ling-Sui; Tsai, Jong-Rung; Hsiao, Shih-Huai",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/1010539520963629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33063525/,512

OBJECTIVES To examine the current awareness of psychiatric comorbidity in dermatologic practice and its management in a sample of dermatologists across the United States. METHODS A survey was conducted that explored physician perspective on psychiatric comorbidity, clinical practice, and management i.e., use of survey screening measures, employment of psychological interventions and coordination with mental health services. SPSS v25 was used for descriptive statistical analysis and to calculate Pearson's correlation coefficients between familiarity with dermatologic/psychiatric comorbidity and its management. RESULTS 98% of respondents believed a relationship between mental and dermatological health. 61.7% of respondents reported seeing patients with known psychological problems more than once a week. The administration of a psychiatric questionnaires was noted in 23% of practices and only 6.38% administer the questionnaire at every appointment. CONCLUSION Management of comorbid disease is best done through the collaboration of dermatology and psychiatry.

Differing seasonal patterns of influenza activity in Hong Kong and England and Wales provide a natural experiment to examine associations with myocardial infarction (MI) independent of cold weather effects. METHODS Weekly clinical and laboratory influenza surveillance data, environmental temperature and humidity data, and counts of MI-associated hospitalizations and deaths were obtained for England and Wales and for Hong Kong for the period 1998-2008. We used Poisson regression models that included environmental and seasonal variables to investigate the relationship between influenza and MI. RESULTS There were ≥1.2 million MI-associated hospitalizations and 410,204 MI-associated deaths in England and Wales, with a marked peak in the winter season. In Hong Kong, the incidence of MI, on the basis of 65,108 hospitalizations and 18,780 deaths, had a large winter and smaller summer peak, mirroring patterns of influenza activity. There was strong evidence for a link between influenza and MI both in England and Wales, where 3.1%-3.4% of MI-associated deaths (P < .001) and 0.7%-1.2% of MI-associated hospitalizations (P < .001) were attributable to influenza, and in Hong Kong, where the corresponding figures were 3.9%-5.6% (P = .018) and 3.0%-3.3% (P = .002).

This study assesses the behaviour of a new composite mesh by comparing it with two latest-generation composites currently used in clinical practice. METHODS Defects (7x5cm) created in the anterior abdominal wall of New Zealand White rabbits were repaired using a polypropylene mesh and the composites: Physiomesh(TM); Ventralight(TM) and a new composite mesh with a three-dimensional macroporous polyester structure and an oxidized collagen/chitosan barrier. Animals were sacrificed on days 14 and 90 postimplant. Specimens were processed to determine host tissue incorporation, gene/protein expression of neo-collagens (RT-PCR/immunofluorescence), macrophage response (RAM-11-immunolabelling) and biomechanical resistance. On postoperative days 7/14, each animal was examined laparoscopically to quantify adhesions between the visceral peritoneum and implant. RESULTS The new composite mesh showed the lowest incidence of seroma in the short term. At each time point, the mesh surface covered with adhesions was greater in controls than composites. By day 14, the implants were fully infiltrated by a loose connective tissue that became denser over time. At 90 days, the peritoneal mesh surface was lined with a stable mesothelium. The new composite mesh induced more rapid tissue maturation than Physiomesh(TM), giving rise to a neoformed tissue containing more type I collagen. In Ventralight(TM) the macrophage reaction was intense and significantly greater than the other composites at both follow-up times. Tensile strengths were similar for each biomaterial. CONCLUSIONS All composites showed optimal peritoneal behaviour, inducing good peritoneal regeneration and scarce postoperative adhesion formation. A greater foreign body reaction was observed for Ventralight(TM). All composites induced good collagen deposition accompanied by optimal tensile strength. The three-dimensional macroporous structure of the new composite mesh may promote rapid tissue regeneration within the mesh.","Pascual, Gemma; Sotomayor, Sandra; Rodríguez, Marta; Bayon, Yves; Bellón, Juan M",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0080647; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24236192/,512

Materials and Methods: We identified items requested for reporting from model reporting guidelines published in computer science, biomedical informatics, and clinical journals, and merged similar items into representative ""atoms"". Four independent reviewers and one adjudicator assessed the degree to which model documentation for 12 models developed by Epic Systems reported the details requested in each atom. We present summary statistics of consensus, interrater agreement, and reporting rates of all atoms for the 12 models. Results: We identified 220 unique atoms across 15 model reporting guidelines. After examining the documentation for the 12 most commonly used Epic models, the independent reviewers had an interrater agreement of 76%. After adjudication, the model documentations' median completion rate of applicable atoms was 39% (range: 31%-47%). Most of the commonly requested atoms had reporting rates of 90% or above, including atoms concerning outcome definition, preprocessing, AUROC, internal validation and intended clinical use. For individual reporting guidelines, the median adherence rate for an entire guideline was 54% (range: 15%-71%). Atoms reported half the time or less included those relating to fairness (summary statistics and subgroup analyses, including for age, race/ethnicity, or sex), usefulness (net benefit, prediction time, warnings on out-of-scope use and when to stop use), and transparency (model coefficients). Atoms reported the least often related to missingness (missing data statistics, missingness strategy), validation (calibration plot, external validation), and monitoring (how models are updated/tuned, prediction monitoring). Conclusion: There are many recommendations about what should be reported about predictive models used to guide care. Existing model documentation examined in this study provides less than half of applicable atoms, and entire reporting guidelines have low adherence rates. Half or less of the reviewed documentation reported information related to usefulness, reliability, transparency and fairness of models.

An increasing prevalence of resistance means that to ensure a good treatment outcome it is desirable to test the susceptibility of each infection to different antibiotics. Conventionally this is done by culturing a clinical sample and then exposing aliquots to a panel of antibiotics, thereby determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each drug. Using 96-well broth micro dilution plates with each well containing a lyophilised pre-determined amount of an antibiotic is a convenient and cost-effective way to measure the MICs of several drugs at once for a clinical sample. Although accurate, this is an expensive and slow process that requires highly-skilled and experienced laboratory scientists. Here we show that, through the BashTheBug project hosted on the Zooniverse citizen science platform, a crowd of volunteers can reproducibly and accurately determine the MICs for 13 drugs and that simply taking the median or mode of 11-17 independent classifications is sufficient. There is therefore a potential role for crowds to support (but not supplant) the role of experts in antibiotic susceptibility testing.","Fowler, Philip W; Wright, Carla; Spiers, Helen; Zhu, Tingting; Baeten, Elisabeth ML; Hoosdally, Sarah W; Cruz, Ana Luíza Gibertoni; Roohi, Aysha; Kouchaki, Samaneh; Walker, Timothy M; Peto, Timothy EA; Miller, Grant; Lintott, Chris; Clifton, David; Crook, Derrick W; Walker, A Sarah",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.20.453060,512

On the other hand, the pandemic initiated increased access to home-working, a change in working arrangements that may prove beneficial to disabled workers employed in desk-based roles. Home-working can increase the accessibility of employment and support work retention for disabled workers, yet pre-pandemic many employers had withheld it. Studies of employees’ and employers’ experiences of home-working during the pandemic have indicated a desire to retain access to home-working in the future. A permanent cultural shift to increased access to home-working would help address the disability employment gap for desk-based workers. However, disabled workers are over-represented in jobs not conducive to home-working, and in sectors that have been hardest hit by business closures during the pandemic, so the position of many disabled workers is likely to remain precarious.","Holland, Paula",Disabilities,https://doi.org/10.3390/disabilities1030013,512

172025,"Le toucher, un acte de tendresse à retrouver",2021,"Abstract Background: Platelets have recently been recognized as immune cells. Platelets first contact invading pathogens and then induce immune reactions in cooperation with white blood cells. Platelet polyphosphate (polyP), which is classically recognized as a thrombotic and hemostatic biomolecule, has recently attracted attention as a cytokine that modulates inflammation and is involved in intercellular communication between platelets and major immune cells. Objective: To determine the involvement of polyP in SARS-Cov-2-mRNA vaccine-induced immune responses, this pilot study examined the effects of mRNA vaccines on platelet polyP levels. Methods: Before and after vaccination (BNT162b2), blood samples were obtained from healthy, non-smoking individuals (relatively older male group, n=6 vs. younger female group, n=23), who did not have systemic diseases that required continuous treatment. Washed platelets were prepared and subjected to a fluorometric determination of platelet polyP levels using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The side effects of vaccination were recorded as scores. Results: Compared with the male group, platelet polyP levels decreased in the relatively younger female group after the initial dose, while the side effect score increased in the female group after the second dose. Moderate correlation coefficients were observed between the reduction in polyP levels and the side effect scores or the original polyP levels. Conclusions: Despite being a pilot study using a small sample size, this study suggests the possibility that platelet polyP may suppress the side effects induced by the mRNA vaccines after the initial dose, but not the second dose, in relatively young female subjects who generally have high immune responsiveness.","Uematsu, T.; Sato, A.; Aizawa, H.; Tsujino, T.; Watanabe, T.; Isobe, K.; Kawabata, H.; Kitamura, Y.; Tanaka, T.; Kawase, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.13.21263437v1?rss=1,512
172882,Transmission de la Covid-19 par aérosol: Quelles conséquences pour la santé publique ?,2021,"Variation in the nucleotides of a codon may cause variations in the evolutionary patterns of a DNA or amino acid sequence. To address the capability of each position of a codon to have non-synonymous mutations, the concept of degree of mutation has been introduced. The degree of mutation of a particular position of codon defines the number of non-synonymous mutations occurring for the substitution of nucleotides at each position of a codon, when other two positions of that codon remain unaltered. A Cellular Automaton (CA), is used as a tool to model the mutations of any one of the four DNA bases A, C, T and G at a time where the DNA bases correspond to the states of the CA cells. Point mutation (substitution type) of a codon which characterizes changes in the amino acids, have been associated with local transition rules of a CA. Though there can be transitions of a 4-state CA with 3-neighbourhood cells, here it has been possible to represent all possible point mutations of a codon in terms of combinations of 16 local transition functions of the CA. Further these rules are divided into 4 classes of equivalence. Also, according to the nature of mutations, the 16 local CA rules of substitutions are classified into 3 sets namely, ‘No Mutation’, ‘Transition’ and ‘Transversion’. The experiment has been carried out with three sets of single nucleotide variations(SNVs) of three different viruses but the symptoms of the diseases caused by them are to some extent similar to each other. They are SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 Type A viruses. The aim is to understand the impact of nucleotide substitutions at different positions of a codon with respect to a particular disease phenotype.","Sengupta, Antara; Ghosh, Sreeya; Choudhury, Pabitra Pal",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.30.458305,512

The number of cloud-free observations for the earth-orbiting optical satellite sensors must be determined to verify how much their observations are affected by clouds. This study determines the quantified wide-ranging impact of clouds on optical satellite observations by mapping the annual total observations (ATOs), annual cloud-free observations (ACFOs), monthly cloud-free observations (MCFOs) maps, and acquisition probability (AP) of ACFOs for the Sentinel 2 (2017–2019) and Landsat 8 (2014–2019) for all the paddy rice fields in Guangdong province (APRFG), China. The ATOs of Landsat 8 showed relatively stable observations compared to the Sentinel 2, and the per-field ACFOs of Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 were unevenly distributed. The MCFOs varied on a monthly basis, but in general, the MCFOs were greater between August and December than between January and July. Additionally, the AP of usable ACFOs with 52.1% (Landsat 8) and 47.7% (Sentinel 2) indicated that these two satellite sensors provided markedly restricted observation capability for rice in the study area. Our findings are particularly important and useful in the tropics and subtropics, and the analysis has described cloud cover frequency and pervasiveness throughout different portions of the rice growing season, providing insight into how rice monitoring activities by using Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 imagery in Guangdong would be impacted by cloud cover.

Methods A nationwide, online-based cross-sectional study was conducted between March 27 and April 30, 2021.A two-stage stratified snowball sampling method was used to include an equivalent number of participants from the four cardinal regions of the country. A vaccine engagement scale was developed, defining vaccine engagement as a multidimensional parameter (5 items) that combined self-stated acceptance and willingness with perceived safety and efficacy of the vaccine. An Engagement score was calculated and the median was used to define engagement versus nonengagement. Sociodemographic and clinical data, perceptions about COVID-19 and levels of adherence to preventive measures were analyzed as predictors for nonengagement. Results We included 1,019 participants, 54% were female and 64% were aged 18-29 years. Overall, there were low rates of self-declared acceptance (26%) and willingness (21%) to take the vaccine, as well as low levels of agreement regarding vaccine safety (21%) and efficacy (30%). Thus, vaccine engagement rate was estimated at 33.5%, and ranged between 29.6-38.5% depending on the region (p>0.05).Nonengagement was independently associated with female gender (OR=2.31, p<0.001), low adherence level to preventive measures (OR=6.93p<0.001), private sector jobs (OR=0.53, p=0.038), perceived COVID-19 severity (OR=0.66, p=0.014), and fear from contracting the disease (OR=0.56, p=0.018).Concern about vaccine side effects (72.0%)and exigence for more efficacy and safety studies (48.3%) were the most commonly reported barrier and enabler for vaccine acceptance respectively; whereas beliefs in the conspiracy theory were reported by 23.4%. Conclusions The very low rates of vaccine engagement among the Algerian populationprobably explain the slow ascension of the vaccination curve in the country. Vaccine awareness campaigns should be implemented to address the multiple misconceptions and enhance the levels of knowledge and perception both about the disease and the vaccine, by prioritizing target populations and engaging both healthcare workers and the general population.","Kacimi, S.

Long-term care organisations have had to meet these challenges by relying on their core ethical values and human capital. This paper examines the occupational welfare policies adopted by a long-term care organisation during the pandemic and the individual, managerial, organisational and societal effects of these policies from an organisational ethics perspective. The study explores the case of a non-profit organisation - Fondazione Monsignor Alessandro Marangoni - that adopted occupational welfare policies, enabling it to manage the early COVID-19 outbreak without negative consequences. The findings show that organisational ethics are embedded into occupational welfare policies and demonstrate their role for the welfare society in times of crisis. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Mion, G.; Bonfanti, A.; Simeoni, F.; Loza Adaui, C.

188933,Alternative Access in Congenital Heart Disease.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND The management of massive pelvic fracture-associated hemorrhage is extremely challenging, particularly in the unstable patient. We sought to characterize and compare the efficacy of a minimally invasive preperitoneal balloon technique (MIB) to standard open packing. METHODS Twenty-six swine were randomized to control (C), open preperitoneal packing technique (OP), and MIB groups. A closed extraperitoneal iliac vascular injury followed by intervention + resuscitation over a 120-minute OP and MIB efficacy was assessed by procedure time, hemodynamics, extraperitoneal tamponade pressures (ETPs), blood loss, and survival. Angiography was performed in select animals, and ETPs were also measured in humans undergoing MIB placement for an elective procedure. RESULTS Baseline parameters (mean arterial pressure [MAP] 29, 38, and 38 mm Hg; cardiac index [CI] 3.5, 3.8, and 4.2; and EPTs 5, 4, and 5 mm Hg) were similar among C, OP, and MIB groups, respectively (all p's > 0.05). The OP and MIB groups had markedly improved MAP and CI versus C. MIB generated significantly higher ETP (28 vs 17 mm Hg), was faster to deploy (164 vs 497 seconds), and had lower total blood loss versus OP (0.7 vs 1.2 L, all p's < 0.05). OP and MIB had equivalent survival times that were significantly improved versus C (91 and 116 vs 43 minutes, p < 0.05). Survival to 2 hours was 80% with OP versus 100% in the MIB group. Angiography showed no active extravasation in both study groups, but controlled partial deflation of the MIB allowed easy visualization of extravasation. Minimally invasive preperitoneal balloon inflation in five human subjects demonstrated a significant increase in mean ETP from 2.4 to 31 mm Hg (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION Minimally invasive preperitoneal balloon tamponade was as effective as OP in improving hemodynamics and prolonging survival times, and performed superiorly to OP in time to placement, blood loss, and generation of tamponade pressures. The MIB allows for controlled deflation and reinflation to facilitate angiographic interventions, and may represent a promising new bedside intervention in this patient population.","Sokol, Kyle K; Black, George E; Willey, Sandra B; Song, Michelle Y; Marko, Shannon T; Eckert, Matthew J; Inaba, Kenji; Martin, Matthew J",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27653169/,512

The aim was to assess discriminative performances of two biomarkers, CD64 on neutrophils (nCD64) and CD169 on monocytes (mCD169), using a new flow cytometry procedure, in patients presenting with fever to the ED during epidemics. Eighty five adult patients presenting with potential infection were included during the 2019 flu season in the ED of La Timone Hospital. They were divided into four diagnostic outcomes according to their clinical records: no-infection, bacterial infection, viral infection and co-infection. Seventy six patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were also compared to 48 healthy volunteers. For the first cohort, 38 (45%) patients were diagnosed with bacterial infections, 11 (13%) with viral infections and 29 (34%) with co-infections. mCD169 was elevated in patients with viral infections, with a majority of Flu A virus or Respiratory Syncytial Virus, while nCD64 was elevated in subjects with bacterial infections, with a majority of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. nCD64 and mCD169 showed 90% and 80% sensitivity, and 78% and 91% specificity, respectively, for identifying patients with bacterial or viral infections. When studied in a second cohort, mCD169 was elevated in 95% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections and remained at normal level in 100% of healthy volunteers. nCD64 and mCD169 have potential for accurately distinguishing bacterial and acute viral infections.

204906,Reevaluation a distance de la symptomatologie des patients atteints de forme legere a moderee de COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the development of dashboards as dynamic, visual tools for communicating COVID-19 data has surged worldwide. Dashboards can inform decision-making and support behavior change. To do so, they must be actionable. The features that constitute an actionable dashboard in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been rigorously assessed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the characteristics of public web-based COVID-19 dashboards by assessing their purpose and users (""why""), content and data (""what""), and analyses and displays (""how"" they communicate COVID-19 data), and ultimately to appraise the common features of highly actionable dashboards. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive assessment and scoring using nominal group technique with an international panel of experts (n=17) on a global sample of COVID-19 dashboards in July 2020. The sequence of steps included multimethod sampling of dashboards; development and piloting of an assessment tool; data extraction and an initial round of actionability scoring; a workshop based on a preliminary analysis of the results; and reconsideration of actionability scores followed by joint determination of common features of highly actionable dashboards. We used descriptive statistics and thematic analysis to explore the findings by research question. RESULTS: A total of 158 dashboards from 53 countries were assessed. Dashboards were predominately developed by government authorities (100/158, 63.0%) and were national (93/158, 58.9%) in scope. We found that only 20 of the 158 dashboards (12.7%) stated both their primary purpose and intended audience. Nearly all dashboards reported epidemiological indicators (155/158, 98.1%), followed by health system management indicators (85/158, 53.8%), whereas indicators on social and economic impact and behavioral insights were the least reported (7/158, 4.4% and 2/158, 1.3%, respectively). Approximately a quarter of the dashboards (39/158, 24.7%) did not report their data sources. The dashboards predominately reported time trends and disaggregated data by two geographic levels and by age and sex. The dashboards used an average of 2.2 types of displays (SD 0.86); these were mostly graphs and maps, followed by tables. To support data interpretation, color-coding was common (93/158, 89.4%), although only one-fifth of the dashboards (31/158, 19.6%) included text explaining the quality and meaning of the data. In total, 20/158 dashboards (12.7%) were appraised as highly actionable, and seven common features were identified between them. Actionable COVID-19 dashboards (1) know their audience and information needs; (2) manage the type, volume, and flow of displayed information; (3) report data sources and methods clearly; (4) link time trends to policy decisions; (5) provide data that are ""close to home""; (6) break down the population into relevant subgroups; and (7) use storytelling and visual cues. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 dashboards are diverse in the why, what, and how by which they communicate insights on the pandemic and support data-driven decision-making. To leverage their full potential, dashboard developers should consider adopting the seven actionability features identified.","Ivankovic, Damir; Barbazza, Erica; Bos, Véronique; Brito Fernandes, Óscar; Jamieson Gilmore, Kendall; Jansen, Tessa; Kara, Pinar; Larrain, Nicolas; Lu, Shan; Meza-Torres, Bernardo; Mulyanto, Joko; Poldrugovac, Mircha; Rotar, Alexandru; Wang, Sophie; Willmington, Claire; Yang, Yuanhang; Yelgezekova, Zhamin; Allin, Sara; Klazinga, Niek; Kringos, Dionne",J Med Internet Res,,512

Many new VCSs have emerged in the past decade and a new market-leader has risen during the coronavirus period of 2020. Understanding how these systems work could help us improve them rapidly. However, no experimental comparison of such systems currently exists. In this work we propose a method to compare VCSs in real-world operation and implement it as a tool. Our method considers four main kinds of real-world experiments. Each captures different aspects, such as communication channels (audio, video, audio-video) and types of network environments (e.g., Ethernet, WiFi, 4G), and reports system and network utilization. We further implement an automated tool to conduct these real-world experiments, and experiment with three popular VCSs, Zoom, Microsoft Team, and Discord. We find that there are significant performance differences between these systems, and their behavior in different environments. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Cuijpers, J.; Elsendoorn, K.; Tjon-Joek-Tjien, E.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective multicentre analysis of the rates of PCI for the treatment of ACS within the period 2 months pre and post the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Ireland, as well as comparing PCI for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with the corresponding period in 2019. During the 2020 COVID-19 period (29 February-30 April 2020), there was a 24% decline in PCI for overall ACS (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.76; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88; p<0.001), including a 29% reduction in PCI for non-ST-elevation ACS (IRR 0.71; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.88; p=0.002) and an 18% reduction in PCI for STEMI (IRR 0.82; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.01; p=0.061), as compared with the 2020 pre-COVID-19 period (1 January-28 February 2020). A 22% (IRR 0.78; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.93; p=0.005) reduction of PCI for STEMI was seen as compared with the 2019 reference period. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a significant reduction in PCI procedures for the treatment of ACS since the COVID-19 outbreak in Ireland. The reasons for this decline are still unclear but patients need to be encouraged to seek medical attention when cardiac symptoms appear, in order to avoid incremental cardiac morbidity and mortality due to a reduction in coronary revascularisation for the treatment of ACS.","Connolly, Niall Patrick; Simpkin, Andrew; Mylotte, Darren; Crowley, James; O039,; Connor, Stephen; AlHarbi, Khalid; Kiernan, Thomas; Arockiam, Sacchin; Owens, Patrick; John, Amal; Blake, Gavin J; Fitzgerald, Sean; Cadogan, Diarmaid; Rosseel, Liesbeth",BMJ Open,,512

METHODS: A national sample of 6,607 adults (4.4% who reported testing positive for COVID-19, 25.3% testing negative, and 70.3% untested) were recruited an online platform andcompleted the Patient Health Questionnaire-2, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2, PTSD-Checklist for DSM-5, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification-Consumption scale, and an item assessing SI in May-June 2020. A series of multivariable analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In the total sample, 35.3% screened positive for current AUD, 33.6% for MDD, 33.6% for GAD, 24.6% for SI, and 20.2% for CS. Past 2-week SI (adjusted odds ratios [AORs]= 1.49-12.06), number of close friends (AORs= 1.40-2.72), history of AUD (AORs= 1.15-1.92), history of anxiety disorder (AORs= 1.07-2.63), and younger age (AORs= 0.97-0.98) were significantly associated with screening positive for MDD, GAD, CS, and AUD. COVID-19 status was not independently associated with these conditions, but the combination of testing positive for COVID-19, meeting criteria for AUD, and screening positive for MDD, GAD, or CS predicted a 96% probability for SI. CONCLUSION: Predisposing factors are stronger predictors of psychological distress than personal COVID-19 infection or exposure. The additive effects of COVID-19 infection, alcohol use, and psychiatric problems in predicting SI suggest screening, monitoring, and treating these conditions in population-based prevention and treatment efforts may be important.","Tsai, Jack; Elbogen, Eric B; Huang, Minda; North, Carol S; Pietrzak, Robert H",J Affect Disord,,512

This discordance illustrates the need for a more unifying explanation as to whether SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly affects erythropoiesis. Here, we show significantly enriched CD71+ erythroid precursors/progenitors in the blood circulation of COVID-19 patients. We found that these cells have distinctive immunosuppressive properties. In agreement, we observed a strong negative correlation between the frequency of these cells with T and B cell proportions in COVID-19 patients. The expansion of these CD71+ erythroid precursors/progenitors was negatively correlated with the hemoglobin levels. A subpopulation of abundant erythroid cells, CD45+ CD71+ cells, co-express ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, and CD26, and these can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In turn, pre-treatment of erythroid cells with dexamethasone significantly diminished ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and subsequently reduced their infectivity with SARS-CoV-2. This provides a novel insight into the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on erythropoiesis and hypoxia seen in COVID-19 patients.","Shahbaz, Shima; Xu, Lai; Osman, Mohammed; Sligl, Wendy; Shields, Justin; Joyce, Michael; Tyrrell, D Lorne; Oyegbami, Olaide; Elahi, Shokrollah",Stem Cell Reports,,512

We therefore investigated the association of &#916;WED with &#916; HRCT score and predictors of a worse &#916; HRCT score in those patients. METHODS: We used an inception cohort of early SSc-ILD patients with availability for two HRCT records at enrollment and 1-year follow-up.The extent of ground glass, reticulation, bronchiectasis, and honeycombing was scored and then aggregated to produce a total HRCT score. The WED was measured at four levels and the maximum value was used. The &#916; maximum WED, &#916; mean WED, and &#916; tHRCT score were analyzed. RESULTS: We recruited 75 early SSc-ILD patients and found a significant correlation of &#916; tHRCT score with a &#916; maximum WED (rho = 0.34, p < 0.01) and &#916; mean WED (rho = 0.26, p < 0.05). There were 34 patients with a worsening &#916; tHRCT (&#916; > 0), 17 with stability (&#916; = 0), and 24 with improvement (&#916; < 0). Patients with a worsening ILD had a significantly shorter disease duration, lower prevalence of tendon friction rub, higher cumulative prednisolone dose, and larger &#916;WED than those with stable and improved &#916; tHRCT scores. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression identified a larger &#916; mean WED (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03-1.42, p = 0.02) as a predictor of worsening HRCT score, while presence of tendon friction rub was associated with a lower risk (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.77, p = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Our study cohort found that a worsening esophageal diameter was a predictor of progression of lung fibrosis determined by HRCT score in early SSc-ILD.

The authors recently identified a racial disparity in access to a laparoscopic approach to inguinal hernia repair, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and colectomy. The present study further evaluates this patient cohort to assess the relationship between the race and postoperative complications and test the mediating effect of the selected surgical approach. METHODS: After institutional review board approval, patients in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database who underwent inguinal hernia repair, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, or colectomy in 2016 were identified. Patient demographics, including the self-reported race and ethnicity, as well as clinical, operative, and postoperative variables were recorded. After the exclusion of cases associated with diagnoses of cancer, a 4:1 propensity score matching algorithm generated a clinically balanced cohort of patients of white and black self-reported race. The mediating effect of an open approach to surgery on the relationship between black self-reported race and postoperative complications was evaluated via a series of regressions. RESULTS: There were 41,340 unilateral inguinal hernia repairs, 3182 bilateral inguinal hernia repairs, 60,444 cholecystectomies, 50,523 appendectomies, and 58,012 colectomies included in the database in 2017. Exclusion of cases associated with cancer and subsequent propensity score matching returned 17,540 unilateral hernia repairs, 890 bilateral hernia repairs, 23,865 cholecystectomies, 11,660 appendectomies, and 12,320 colectomies. On mediation analysis, any complication, severe complication, and death were significant when regressed on black self-reported race (any: odds ratio [OR] = 1.210, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.132-1.291, P < 0.001; severe: OR = 1.352, 95% CI = 1.245-1.466, P < 0.001; death: OR = 1.358, 95% CI = 1.000-1.818, P = 0.044), and open surgery was a significant mediator in the incidence of any complication and severe complication (any: OR = 1.180, 95% CI = 1.105-1.260, P < 0.001 and severe: OR = 1.307, 95% CI = 1.203-1.418, P < 0.001).

DESIGN: A cross-sectional correlational survey with a combination of a convenience and snowball sampling design. SETTING: This study was conducted online from February 7 to 14, 2020, the third week after the lockdown of Wuhan city on January 23. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2,654 residents was contacted, 2,534 agreed to participate, and 2,215 completed valid questionnaires. The sample covered 30 provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions of China, and a broader region. MEASURES: The Uncertainty About COVID-19 Scale was applied to assess perceived public uncertainty. Five dimensions of health beliefs about COVID-19 and 12 health-related response behaviors were measured. ANALYSIS: Univariate analysis and multiple linear regression models were used to identify associations. Mediation was assessed by a bootstrapping technique. RESULTS: Five constructs of health beliefs were found to be significant predictors of multiple response behaviors. Uncertainty about COVID-19 has a direct relationship with general response behaviors (ß=-0.119**) and sanitization practices (ß=-0.068**). Emergency coping behaviors aside, uncertainty also partially mediated associations between perceived susceptibility, perceived effectiveness, and perceived barriers influencing general response behaviors and sanitization practices, respectively. CONCLUSION: Findings provide evidence-based information to government and policymakers for designing effective health communication messages and intervention strategies by targeting the key constructs of the health belief model and reducing perceived uncertainty about COVID-19. They support public health-related response behaviors to prevent COVID-19 spread among the population.","Wu, Dan; Rockett, Ian R H; Yang, Tingzhong; Yang, Xiaozhao Yousef; Wang, Mengmeng; Jiao, Can",Am J Health Promot,,512

As we uncover the links between host genomics and infectious disease, a number of ethical, legal, and social issues need to be considered when using that information in clinical practice or workforce decisions. We conducted a survey of the clinical staff at 10 federally funded Regional Ebola and Other Special Pathogen Treatment Centers to understand their views regarding the ethical, legal, and social issues related to host genomics and the administrative and clinical functions of high-level isolation units. Respondents overwhelmingly agreed that genomics could provide valuable information to identify patients and employees at higher risk for poor outcomes from highly infectious diseases. However, there was considerable disagreement about whether such data should inform the allocation of scarce resources or determine treatment decisions. While most respondents supported a confidential employer-based genomic testing system to inform individual employees about risk, respondents disagreed about whether such information should be used in staffing models. Respondents who thought genomic information would be valuable for patient treatment were more willing to undergo genetic testing for staffing purposes. Most respondents felt they would benefit from additional training to better interpret results from genetic testing. Although this study was completed before the COVID-19 pandemic, the responses provide a baseline assessment of provider attitudes that can inform policy during the current pandemic and in future infectious disease outbreaks.","Gerber, Jennifer E; Geller, Gail; Boyce, Angie; Maragakis, Lisa L; Garibaldi, Brian T",Health Secur,,512

Growing evidence is revealing further pathophysiological mechanisms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Amongst these dysregulated pathways inflammation seems to play a more critical role toward COVID-19 complications. In the present study, precise inflammatory pathways triggered by SARS-CoV-2, along with potential therapeutic candidates have been discussed. Prevailing evidence has indicated a close correlation of inflammatory cascades with severity, pathological progression, and organ damages in COVID-19 patients. From the mechanistic point of view, interleukin-6, interleukin-1ß receptor, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor, toll-like receptor, receptor tyrosine kinases, growth factor receptor, Janus kinase/signal transducers and transcription pathway, mammalian target of rapamycin, cytokine storm and macrophage activation have shown to play critical roles in COVID-19 complications. So, there is an urgent need to provide novel mechanistic-based anti-inflammatory agents. This review highlights inflammatory signaling pathways of SARS-CoV-2.

We assessed trends and correlates of HPV vaccine uptake from 2012 to 2019 in a cohort of gbMSM in Vancouver. METHODS: We recruited sexually active gbMSM aged &#8805;16 years using respondent-driven sampling from February 2012 to February 2015 and followed them until July 2019. We evaluated self-reported HPV vaccine trends using mixed-effects logistic regression and identified factors associated with uptake using multivariable mixed-effects Poisson regression. RESULTS: A total of 719 participants were recruited and completed the baseline visit, of whom 549 were unvaccinated with at least one follow-up visit. The median age was 33 years and 23% were living with HIV. HPV vaccination increased from 4% in 2012 to 28% in 2019 (p<0.001) among gbMSM >26 years, and from 9% in 2012 to 20% in 2017 (p<0.001) among gbMSM &#8804;26 years. Vaccination uptake increased after September 2015, following vaccination policy expansion (adjusted rate ratio (aRR)=1.82, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.12). In multivariable models, increased vaccination was associated with age &#8804;26 years vs &#8805;45 years (aRR=3.90; 95% CI 1.75 to 8.70), age 27-44 vs &#8805;45 years (aRR=2.86; 95% CI 1.46 to 5.62), involvement in gay community sports teams (aRR=2.31; 95% CI 1.15 to 4.64) and other groups (aRR=1.71; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.79), awareness of HIV-postexposure prophylaxis (aRR=5.50; 95% CI 1.31 to 23.09), recent sexually transmitted infection testing (aRR=2.72; 95% CI 1.60 to 4.60) and recent sex-work (aRR=2.59; 95% CI 1.08 to 6.19).

METHODS: A total of 104 sepsis patients and 100 healthy controls (HCs) were consecutively enrolled, and miR-146b relative expression in their plasma samples was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In sepsis patients, disease severity was assessed using Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. ARDS occurrence and 28-day mortality were recorded. RESULTS: MiR-146b was decreased in sepsis patients compared to HCs. ARDS occurred in 30 (28.8%) sepsis patients, and miR-146b was reduced in ARDS sepsis patients compared to non-ARDS sepsis patients. Meanwhile, miR-146b distinguished ARDS sepsis patients from non-ARDS sepsis patients (area under the curve (AUC): 0.728, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.627-0.829). Subsequent multivariate logistic regression showed that miR-146b, age, smoke, respiratory infection, and serum creatinine predicted ARDS risk independently, and their combination well-discriminated ARDS sepsis patients from non-ARDS sepsis patients (AUC: 0.863, 95% CI: 0.792-0.934). Additionally, miR-146b was negatively correlated with serum creatinine, white blood cell, C-reactive protein, APACHE II score, and SOFA score, while positively correlated with albumin. Regarding prognosis, miR-146b was decreased in 28-day sepsis deaths compared to 28-day sepsis survivors, and it discriminated 28-day sepsis deaths from 28-day sepsis survivors (AUC: 0.785, 95% CI: 0.680-0.890). CONCLUSION: MiR-146b might serve as a potential biomarker for ARDS prevention and prognostic reflection in sepsis.","Chen, Wenfeng; Liu, Lili; Yang, Junhui; Wang, Yujun",J Clin Lab Anal,,512

Little is known about protective antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in tears after infection or vaccination. We analysed SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA responses in human tears after either COVID-19 infection or vaccination. MethodsWe recruited 16 subjects with COVID-19 infection an average of 7 months previously and 15 subjects before and 2 weeks after Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNtech) vaccination. Plasma, saliva and basal tears were collected. Pre-pandemic plasma, saliva and basal tears from 11 individuals were included as healthy controls. Antibody responses to 5 SARS-CoV-2 antigens were measured via multiplex. ResultsIgG antibodies to Spike and Nucleoprotein were detected in tears, saliva and plasma from subjects with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison to uninfected controls. While RBD-specific antibodies were detected in plasma, minimal RBD-specific antibodies were detected in tears and saliva. In contrast, high levels of IgG antibodies to Spike and RBD, but not Nucleoprotein, were induced in tears, saliva and plasma of subjects receiving 2 doses of the Comirnaty vaccine. Increased levels of IgA1 and IgA2 antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 antigens were detected in plasma following infection or vaccination, but were unchanged in tears and saliva. ConclusionBoth infection and vaccination induce SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in tears. RBD-specific IgG antibodies in tears were induced by vaccination but were not present 7 months post-infection. This suggests neutralising antibodies may be low in the tears late following infection.","Selva, Kevin John; Davis, Samantha K; Haycroft, Ebene R; Lee, Wen Shi; Lopez, Ester; Reynaldi, Arnold; Davenport, Miles Philip; Kent, Helen E; Juno, Jennifer A; Chung, Amy W; Kent, Stephen J",,,512
225403,Patient perspectives on chemotherapy de-escalation: “Don't de-escalate! I don't want to die!”,2021,"Introduction: While access to health care is free in Australia, access to lung cancer treatments is not always affordable or timely, especially for a rare cancer patient like the author Diagnosed with ROS1+ NSCLC, the author had to crowdfund to pay for her first targeted therapy the price of which exceeded what most Australians could afford Acutely aware that her participation in a subsequent clinical trial is uncommon for someone with a similar minority background, the author seeks to explore the concept of patient experience in the context of diversity and inequity Patient experience is multidimensional and integrated The quality and safety of services provided, the costs incurred, and the outcomes achieved are all important facets of the patient experience [1] The ultimate goals of advocates are to achieve optimal patient experience by ensuring that patients’ needs are heard, and problems are resolved To do this effectively, advocates must understand the unmet needs of the patients they seek to represent However, lung cancer patient experience is not homogenous and is impacted by social determinants In Australia, lung cancer outcomes differ across socioeconomic status (SES), indigenous status and remoteness For example: (a) the incidence rates of lung cancer in 2010-14 were 27% higher in remote and very remote areas combined, compared to major Australian cities;(b) the mortality rate was highest in the lowest SES areas (SES1, 38 5 per 100,000 persons), compared to the highest SES areas (SES5, 20 1 per 100,000 persons);and (c) the 5-year survival rate for lung cancer in 2010-2014 was 8 5% for Indigenous Australians compared to 14 2% for non-Indigenous Australians [2] Health inequities exist both within and among countries [3], so the lung cancer patient experience would no doubt also differ within and between countries The aim of this presentation is to draw insights from the author’s lung cancer patient experience as well as patient anecdotes from other countries and continents Method: Three separate interviews were conducted through a cloud-based video conference service The interviewees were asked to share stories of lung cancer patient experience in their country, observations on key areas of improvement, and comments on how the global lung cancer community can support them Results: The interviewees comprised of two female lung cancer patients from the Netherlands and New Zealand, and a male lung cancer advocate from Nigeria Interview 1: Experience from The Netherlands: The insights of the patient advocate from the Netherlands were mostly very positive She described her experience of free access to healthcare, timely and free access to treatment, optimal level of nursing care, and integrated psychosocial services While there remains is a need to address stigma systematically and collaboratively, the interviewee observes that lung cancer care in the Netherlands may be held as a model for healthcare Interview 2: Experience from New Zealand: The anecdotes shared by the patient advocate from New Zealand somewhat differ While access to healthcare is free, most lung cancer patients are treated by general oncologists The patient advocate’s key area of concern is the limited access to biomarker testing, treatment options and clinicals trials She calls on the global lung cancer community to raise awareness about the lack of treatment options in New Zealand Interview 3: Experience from Nigeria: The third interview was with a former caregiver and advocate from Nigeria provided anecdotes and observations that were drastically different from the others Tragically, because healthcare costs are not subsidized and can be prohibitive, many people do not get diagnosed at all If diagnosed, a lung cancer patient would attend a general cancer clinic to see a general oncologist Treatment options are very limited as there is currently no access to any lung cancer biomarker testing, targeted therapy or immunotherapy There are currently no lung cancer clinical trials in Nigeria The interviewee descr bed feelings of sadness and despair when watching presentations on global lung cancer research and medical advancements He believes that the first step to tackle the dire position of lung cancer patients in Nigeria and Africa is to understand the current standard of lung cancer care in these respective areas He calls on the global community to provide support in that regard Conclusion: Lung cancer patient experience is not only multidimensional but also diverse The key insights drawn from the interviews are that, to ensure a comprehensive lung cancer patient experience, it is crucial that: (a) lung cancer advocates are aware and mindful of social determinants as well as issues that can significantly impact on patient outcomes, including inequity, accessibility, resourcing and poverty;(b) lung cancer researchers, clinicians and policy makers actively address disparities by engaging with a wide variety of patients and caregivers in their work;and (c) the lung cancer global community is sensitive to the impact of accelerating medical advancements on the widening gap of global health inequities, and ensure that all communication is appropriately respectful The reduction of inequities is a moral obligation [4] It may be difficult to comprehend in the year of the dawn of COVID-19, but it is time for us to advance beyond just tackling diseases It is our collective ethical responsibility to consider the whole patient experience in all aspects of lung cancer care, and to do so through the lenses of health inequities As the World Health Organisation states “[r]educing health inequities is… an ethical imperative Social injustice is killing people on a grand scale ” [5] Acknowledgements: My gratitude to Caleb Egwuenu, Lily Huang and Merel Hennink for generously sharing their time and experience which significantly contributed to this presentation

225642,Development and validation of a simple-to-use nomogram to predict the deterioration and survival of patients with COVID-19,2021,"The rapid development of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines has not been met with the assurance of an effective and equitable global distribution mechanism. Low-income countries are especially at-risk, with the price of the vaccines and supply shortages limiting their ability to procure and distribute the vaccines. While the COVAX initiative is one of the solutions to these challenges, vaccine nationalism has resulted in the hoarding of vaccines and the signing of parallel bilateral deals, undermining this formerly promising initiative. Moreover, inequity in local distribution also remains a problem, with clear discrimination of minorities and lack of logistical preparation in some countries. As we continue to distribute the COVID-19 vaccines, pharmaceutical companies should share their technology to increase supply and reduce prices, governments should prioritize equitable distribution to the most at-risk in all nations and low-income countries should bolster their logistical capacity in preparation for mass vaccination campaigns.","Binagwaho, Agnes; Mathewos, Kedest; Davis, Sheila",Int. j. health policy manag,,512

METHODS: To identify the key parameters or processes that have the greatest effects on the pandemic and reveal the different progressions of epidemics in different countries, we quantified enhanced control measures and the dynamics of the production and provision of medical resources. We then nested these within a COVID-19 epidemic transmission model, which is parameterized by multi-source data. We obtained rate functions related to the intensity of mitigation measures, the effective reproduction numbers and the timings and durations of runs on medical resources, given differing control measures implemented in various countries. RESULTS: Increased detection rates may induce runs on medical resources and prolong their durations, depending on resource availability. Nevertheless, improving the detection rate can effectively and rapidly reduce the mortality rate, even after runs on medical resources. Combinations of multiple prevention and control strategies and timely improvement of abilities to supplement medical resources are key to effective control of the COVID-19 epidemic. A 50% reduction in comprehensive control measures would have led to the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and deaths exceeding 590,000 and 60,000, respectively, by 27 March 2020 in mainland China. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple data sources and cross validation of a COVID-19 epidemic model, coupled with a medical resource logistic model, revealed the key factors that affect epidemic progressions and their outbreak patterns in different countries. These key factors are the type of emergency medical response to avoid runs on medical resources, especially improved detection rates, the ability to promote public health measures, and the synergistic effects of combinations of multiple prevention and control strategies. The proposed model can assist health authorities to predict when they will be most in need of hospital beds and equipment such as ventilators, personal protection equipment, drugs, and staff.","Wang, Xia; Li, Qian; Sun, Xiaodan; He, Sha; Xia, Fan; Song, Pengfei; Shao, Yiming; Wu, Jianhong; Cheke, Robert A; Tang, Sanyi; Xiao, Yanni",BMC Public Health,,512

236698,Covid Times,2021,"The moult cycle is arguably the most critical aspect of crustacean biology and is associated with dramatic changes in behaviour, physiology and condition. Here we describe the first detailed investigation of the combined changes in morphology, physiological status and nutritional condition over the moult cycle of juvenile T. australiensis. Haemolymph refractive index (measured as Brix) was evaluated as a non-destructive method for predicting physiological status and nutritional condition. Post-moult, inter-moult and pre-moult stages were identifiable by microscopic examination of the pleopod distal tips, though differentiation of the pre-moult substages was not possible using this technique. Monitoring of ecdysial suture lines on the exoskeleton gill chambers was found to be highly useful for visually determining progression through the pre-moult stage and predicting the timing of ecdysis. A classical pattern of inter-moult growth was observed where size and wet weight remained relatively uniform over the moult cycle while highly significant changes in whole-body composition were simultaneously observed over time. Growth was most evident by changes in dry weight and dry matter content which more than doubled by the onset of pre-moult. Changes in dry matter content were generally mirrored by Brix and whole-body crude protein, total lipid and gross energy content. Brix strongly correlated with dry matter content and significant correlations were also found for all other primary measures of nutritional condition. Typical moult-related changes were also found for circulating ecdysteroids. This study clearly demonstrates pronounced cyclical changes in physiology and condition of juvenile T. australiensis over a typical moult cycle. The significant correlations between haemolymph and whole-body composition validates Brix as a practical and non-destructive method to objectively assess physiological status, nutritional condition and quality in T. australiensis and further demonstrates its potential for individual crustacean assessment in experimental research and practical commercial applications.","Landman, Michael J; Fitzgibbon, Quinn P; Wirtz, Andrea; Codabaccus, Basseer M; Ventura, Tomer; Smith, Gregory G; Carter, Chris G",Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol,,512

240669,Ouverture de 'The New European Industrial Strategy: Companies and Territories' *,2020,"In light of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) released a joint statement in March 2020 recommending an immediate suspension of medical student participation in direct patient contact. As graduating medical students who will soon begin residency, the authors fully support this recommendation. Though paid health care workers, like residents, nurses, and environmental services staff, are essential to the management of COVID-19 patients, medical students are not. Students' continued involvement in direct patient care will contribute to SARS-CoV-2 exposures and transmissions and will waste already limited personal protective equipment. By decreasing nonessential personnel in health care settings, including medical students, medical schools will contribute to national and global efforts to ""flatten the curve.""The authors also assert that medical schools are responsible for ensuring medical student safety. Without the protections provided to paid health care workers, students are uniquely disadvantaged within the medical hierarchy; these inequalities must be addressed before medical students are safely reintegrated into clinical roles. Although graduating medical students and institutional leadership may worry that suspending clinical rotations might prevent students from completing graduation requirements, the authors argue the ethical obligation to ""flatten the curve"" supersedes usual teaching responsibilities.

Diabetes is the most common comorbidities in adult patients infected with Severe Acute Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has been associated with increased mortality. This study analyzed the mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes. Methods: 654 patients with COVID-19, including 81 diabetic patients and 573 nondiabetic patients from March to December/2020, were registered. Administrative data from hospitalizations reimbursed by the health plan were analyzed. Dependent variable: mortality rate (MR) of both groups had the number of deaths as a numerator and the number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the period as denominator. Independent variables: age and sex. The main outcome was mortality by the SARS-CoV2. Statistical: Microsoft Excel® v2010 and Qlik Sense® v13.21 were used for relative and absolute frequencies, means and standard deviation (95% confidence intervals, significance when p&lt;0.05). Results: From the total number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 50.6% were male and 49.4% female. The median age was 64.3 years. Approximately 12.4% of patients had diabetes. The mortality rate in diabetic patients was 28.4% and 18.0% in nondiabetic patients, with a pooled Odds Ratio of 1.81 (95% CI 1.07 – 3.07;p &lt; 0.05). When comparing the rate by sex, mortality in diabetic men was higher than in women (21.1% and 17.3%, respectively;p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: This study suggests that diabetes are associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related in-hospital death confirming a need for close monitoring of diabetic patients during hospitalization. Increased COVID-19-related mortality usually was associated with cardiovascular and renal complications of diabetes. Diabetes requires uninterrupted treatment, so Healthcare System must take steps to ensure access to the care it needs.","Busch, J.; Reis Neto, J. P.",Value in Health,,512

We aimed to investigate the prevalence rate of insomnia and to confirm the related social psychological factors among medical staff in hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method: Medical staff members in China were recruited, including frontline medical workers. The questionnaire, administered through the WeChat program, obtained demographic data and asked self-design questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, insomnia/depressive/anxiety symptoms, and stress-related symptoms. We used a logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors and insomnia symptoms. Result: There were a total of 1,563 participants in our study. Five-hundred-and-sixty-four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score ≥ 8). A multiple binary logistic regression model revealed that insomnia symptoms were associated with an education level of high school or below (OR = 2.69, p = 0.042, 95% CI = 1.0–7.0), being a doctor (OR = 0.44, p = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.2–0.8), currently working in an isolation unit (OR = 1.71, p = 0.038, 95% CI = 1.0–2.8), is worried about being infected (OR = 2.30, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = 1.6–3.4), perceived lack of helpfulness in terms of psychological support from news or social media with regard to COVID-19 (OR = 2.10, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.3–3.3), and having very strong uncertainty regarding effective disease control (OR = 3.30, p = 0.013, 95% CI = 1.3–8.5). Conclusion: Our study found that more than one-third of the medical staff suffered insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. The related factors included education level, an isolation environment, psychological worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, and being a doctor. Interventions for insomnia among medical staff are needed considering the various sociopsychological factors at play in this situation.","Zhang, Chenxi; Yang, Lulu; Liu, Shuai; Ma, Simeng; Wang, Ying; Cai, Zhongxiang; Du, Hui; Li, Ruiting; Kang, Lijun; Su, Meilei; Zhang, Jihui; Liu, Zhongchun; Zhang, Bin",Front.

This review summarizes available pediatric data and covers the aspects of epidemiology, critical illness with acute infection [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)], the discovered multi-inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and management options. RECENT FINDINGS: The available data from the source of the initial viral transmission and then through Europe, Africa, and the Western Hemisphere identifies important aspects of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic: 1) Pediatric infection occurs commonly, is likely underestimated, and transmission patterns remain incompletely described, 2) Pediatric patients suffer multiple end-organ injuries but COVID-19 is not the same prevalence in terms of severity as in adults, 3) MIS-C is a novel and life-threatening manifestation of exposure to the virus, 4) Management using a combination of supportive care, standard practice intensive care management, and anti-inflammatory agents is associated with recovery, 5) Long-term sequelae of viral exposure is unknown at this time. SUMMARY: Emerging evidence suggests pediatric patients are at risk for severe and life-threatening effects of exposure to SARS-CoV2. As the pandemic continues, further research is warranted - particularly as a vaccine is not yet available for use in children.","Damania, Rahul; Moore, Whitney; Viamonte, Heather C; Kamat, Pradip; Basu, Rajit K",Curr Opin Pediatr,,512
247693,Considérations relatives aux personnes handicapées à prendre en compte dans le cadre de la flambée de COVID-19,2020,"This study aims at developing and demonstrating in a real case study a methodology for supporting Occupational Health and Safety Services in the design and assessment of preventive measures to reduce the risks of COVID-19 outbreaks within their entities. The proposed methodology applies the concepts from Social Network Analysis (SNA) to the current challenge of preventing risks of contagion of viruses like SARS-COV-2 among employees. For this purpose, the authors consider a network of employees whose interaction is caused by triggers, which are defined as common circumstances between two workers that may result in contagion, like sharing an office or participating in the same management board. The network cohesion is then evaluated, and those core nodes, which are the most significant contributors to its integration, are identified to be addressed in the design of the preventive measures. The impact of the designed preventive measures on the networks' cohesion is assessed for its prioritization and further deployment. The methodology has been demonstrated in a real case, a Spanish Research Center, providing promising results in a quick and easy manner. The objective insights provided by its application were demonstrated as very valuable for the Occupational Health and Safety Services in the design and evaluation of the set of preventing measures to be implemented before the return of the employees to the facilities after the Spanish confinement period. The current COVID-19 outbreak brings the need to develop tools and methods to support businesses and institutions in the use of SNA for preventing outbreaks among their employees. Although some literature does exist in the field of SNA application in epidemiology, its adaptation for extensive use by the Occupational and Health Services is still a challenge.","Gallardo, Elena Calvo; de Arroyabe, Juan Carlos Fernandez; Arranz, Nieves",Sustainability,,512

The origin of this new virus is presumed zoonotic, with bats being its probable vector. Due to the rapid number of infections and deaths that occurred first in China and later around the world, the infection of this virus quickly went from being an isolated outbreak in a Chinese region to becoming a health emergency of international concern and later, a pandemic.

Materials/Methods: Between April 2020 and July 2020, patients without influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms at four radiation oncology departments (2 academic university hospitals and 2 community hospitals) underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 prior to the initiation of treatment. Patients were tested either prior to radiotherapy simulation or after simulation but prior to treatment initiation. Patients tested for indications of ILI symptoms were excluded from this analysis. Management of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients was individualized based on disease site and acuity. Results: Over a three-month period, a total of 385 tests were performed in 336 asymptomatic patients either prior to simulation (n=75), post-simulation, prior to treatment (n=230), or on-treatment (n=49). A total of 5 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, for a pre-treatment prevalence of 1.3% (2.6% in North/Central NJ and 0.4% in Southern NJ/Southeast PA). The median age of positive patients was 58 years (range: 38-78 years). All positive patients were white and were relatively equally distributed with regard to gender (2 male, 3 female) and ethnicity (2 Hispanic and 3 non-Hispanic). The median Charlson comorbidity score among positive patients was 5. All 5 patients were treated for different primary tumor sites, the large majority had advanced disease (80%), and all were treated for curative intent. The majority of positive patients were being treated with either sequential or concurrent immunosuppressive systemic therapy (80%). Initiation of treatment was delayed for 14 days with the addition of re-testing for 4 patients, while one patient was treated without delay but with additional infectious-disease precautions. Conclusion: Broad-based pre-treatment asymptomatic testing of radiation oncology patients for SARS-CoV-2 is of limited value, even in a high-incidence region. Future strategies may include focused risk-stratified asymptomatic testing.","Modi, C; Dragun, A E; Henson, C F; Jain, S; Ahlawat, S; Eastwick, G; Kubicek, G J; Mezera, M; Mulvihill, D J; Perri, J; Juneja, B; Khullar, K; Ennis, R D; Haffty, B G",Adv Radiat Oncol,,512

Materials and Methods: Eighteen cyclists (VÌO2peak: 57 ± 7 ml·kg-1·min-1) were pair-matched for anaerobic capacity determined by maximal accumulated oxygen deficit (MAOD) and allocated to a 4-week interval training in hypoxia (IHT; FiO2 = 14.7% ± 0.5%, n = 9) or interval training in normoxia (NORM; FiO2 = 20.6% ± 0.3%, n = 9). Cyclists completed twice weekly interval training (8 × 1 minutes: â¼120% VÌO2peak, 5 minutes recovery: â¼50% VÌO2peak) in addition to their habitual training. Before and after the intervention, a constant work rate supramaximal time to fatigue and a graded exercise test were used to determine changes in anaerobic capacity/supramaximal work performed and aerobic capacity/peak aerobic power output, respectively. Results: No interaction or main effects were observed. Using indirect calorimetry, anaerobic capacity was not significantly different in either group pre- to postintervention using MAOD (IHT: 4% ± 15%; NORM: -5% ± 12%) or gross efficiency methods (IHT: 7% ± 14%; NORM: -2% ± 9%), and VO2peak was unchanged (IHT: 1% ± 6%; NORM: 1% ± 4%). However, within-group analysis shows that supramaximal work performed improved with IHT (14% ± 13%; p = 0.02; d = 0.42) but not NORM (1% ± 22%), and peak aerobic power output increased with IHT (5% ± 7%; p = 0.04; d = 0.32) but not NORM (2% ± 4%). Conclusion: Steady-state, set duration supramaximal interval training in hypoxia appears to provide a small beneficial effect on work capacity during supramaximal and high intensity exercise.","Arezzolo, Damon; Coffey, Vernon G; Byrne, Nuala M; Doering, Thomas M",,,512

In Spain, in a short period of time, health professionals went from a situation of stability to living with a working environment characterized by overcrowded hospitals, lack of individual protection equipment, non-existent or contradictory work protocols, as well as an unknown increase in mortality. Although in their professional activity health workers are closely linked to death processes, in recent months, working conditions and health emergencies have drawn an unheard of working scenario, with the stress and anxiety they may suffer when faced with the death of their patients. The present quantitative research was carried out in different hospitals in Spain on health professionals during the month of April 2020. Through the subscale of anxiety in the face of the death of others, developed by Collett-Lester, it has been verified that health professionals have had to develop their work in a context of precariousness, putting at risk both their individual and collective health, notably increasing anxiety in the face of the death of their patients. The predictive variables of this anxiety have been the absence of individual protection equipment, as well as high levels in the burnout subscales of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization.","Lázaro-Pérez, Cristina; Martínez-López, Jose Ángel; Gómez-Galán, José; López-Meneses, Eloy",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,512

Análisis del #ACSCC20 y #CNCirugia2020,2021,"Although testing is widely regarded as critical to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, what measure and level of testing best reflects successful infection control remains unresolved. Our aim was to compare the sensitivity of two testing metrics - population testing number and testing coverage - to population mortality outcomes and identify a benchmark for testing adequacy. We aggregated publicly available data through 12 April on testing and outcomes related to COVID-19 across 36 OECD (Organization for Economic Development) countries and Taiwan. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between the aforementioned metrics and following outcome measures: deaths per 1 million people, case fatality rate and case proportion of critical illness. Fractional polynomials were used to generate scatter plots to model the relationship between the testing metrics and outcomes. We found that testing coverage, but not population testing number, was highly correlated with population mortality (rs = -0.79, P = 5.975 × 10-9vs. rs = -0.3, P = 0.05) and case fatality rate (rs = -0.67, P = 9.067 × 10-6vs. rs = -0.21, P = 0.20). A testing coverage threshold of 15-45 signified adequate testing: below 15, testing coverage was associated with exponentially increasing population mortality; above 45, increased testing did not yield significant incremental mortality benefit. Taken together, testing coverage was better than population testing number in explaining country performance and can serve as an early and sensitive indicator of testing adequacy and disease burden.","Wei, C; Lee, C C; Hsu, T C; Hsu, W T; Chan, C C; Chen, S C; Chen, C J",Epidemiol Infect,,512

We advocate a new global approach to address this conservation gap, which must enable megafaunal populations to recover to functionally relevant densities. We conclude that re-establishing biome and Earth system functions needs to become an urgent global priority for conservation science and policy.","Norris, Ken; Terry, Andrew; Hansford, James P; Turvey, Samuel T",Trends ecol. evol,,512
267920,Impact de l’épidémie à coronavirus 2019 sur l’organisation d’un service de radiothérapie : expérience du télétravail pour les manipulateurs,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Old age, obesity and vitamin D deficiency are considered as independent risk factors for severe courses of COVID-19. The aim of the review is to discuss common features of these risk factors and the impact of vitamin D. RECENT FINDINGS: The recently discovered relationship between vitamin D and the infection pathway of the virus via the renin--angiotensin system (RAS) and the adipokines leptin and adiponectin play an important role. The frequency of studies showing a relationship between a low vitamin D status in comorbidities and severe COVID-19 courses makes an impact of vitamin D effects likely. SUMMARY: There is a direct relationship between vitamin D, body fat and age in COVID-19 courses. With age, the ability of the skin to synthesize vitamin D decreases, and leads to vitamin D-deficits. If the skin is insufficiently exposed to sunlight, severe deficits can develop. As vitamin D plays an important role not only in the immune system but also in the RAS, and thus at the point where the virus attacks, a good vitamin D supply is an important basis for reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 processes. Treatment with vitamin D supplements should be based on severity of the vitamin D deficiency.","Biesalski, Hans K",Curr. opin. clin. nutr. metab. care,,512

268454,Crise COVID 19: Les étudiants en médecine en renfort de la régulation médicale,2021,"In eukaryotes, the major nuclear export pathway for mature mRNAs uses the dimeric receptor TAP/p15, which is recruited to mRNAs via the multisubunit TREX complex, comprising the THO core and different export adaptors. Viruses that replicate in the nucleus adopt different strategies to hijack cellular export factors and achieve cytoplasmic translation of their mRNAs. No export receptors are known in plants, but Arabidopsis TREX resembles the mammalian complex, with a conserved hexameric THO core associated with ALY and UIEF proteins, as well as UAP56 and MOS11. The latter protein is an orthologue of mammalian CIP29. The nuclear export mechanism for viral mRNAs has not been described in plants. To understand this process, we investigated the export of mRNAs of the pararetrovirus CaMV in Arabidopsis and demonstrated that it is inhibited in plants deficient in ALY, MOS11 and/or TEX1. Deficiency for these factors renders plants partially resistant to CaMV infection. Two CaMV proteins, the coat protein P4 and reverse transcriptase P5, are important for nuclear export. P4 and P5 interact and co-localise in the nucleus with the cellular export factor MOS11. The highly structured 5' leader region of 35S RNAs was identified as an export enhancing element that interacts with ALY1, ALY3 and MOS11 in vitro.","Kubina, Julie; Geldreich, Angèle; Gales, Jón Pol; Baumberger, Nicolas; Bouton, Clément; Ryabova, Lyubov A; Grasser, Klaus D; Keller, Mario; Dimitrova, Maria",Nucleic acids res,,512

While some effective vaccines are nowadays approved and extensively administered, the long-term efficacy and safety of this line of intervention is constantly under debate as coronaviruses rapidly mutate and several SARS-CoV-2 variants have been already identified worldwide. Then, the WHO's main recommendations to prevent severe clinical complications by COVID-19 are still essentially based on social distancing and limitation of human interactions, therefore the identification of new target-based drugs became a priority. Several strategies have been proposed to counteract such viral infection, including the repurposing of FDA already approved for the treatment of HIV, HCV, and EBOLA, inter alia. Among the evaluated compounds, inhibitors of the main protease of the coronavirus (Mpro) are becoming more and more promising candidates. Mpro holds a pivotal role during the onset of the infection and its function is intimately related with the beginning of viral replication. The interruption of its catalytic activity could represent a relevant strategy for the development of anti-coronavirus drugs. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is a peculiar cysteine protease of the coronavirus family, responsible for the replication and infectivity of the parasite. This review offers a detailed analysis of the repurposed drugs and the newly synthesized molecules developed to date for the treatment of COVID-19 which share the common feature of targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, as well as a brief overview of the main enzymatic and cell-based assays to efficaciously screen such compounds.","Citarella, Andrea; Scala, Angela; Piperno, Anna; Micale, Nicola",Biomolecules,,512

To assess the utility of the tests for clinical use and seroepidemiologic studies, we examined the sensitivity of commercial antibody tests from Roche, Abbott, Novatec, Virotech Siemens, Euroimmun, and Mediagnost in a prospective diagnostic study. The tests were evaluated with 73 sera from SARS CoV-2 RNA positive individuals with mild to moderate disease or asymptomatic infection. Sera were obtained at 2-3 weeks (Nâ¯=â¯25) or > 4 weeks (Nâ¯=â¯48) after symptom onset and viral RNA test. The overall sensitivity of the tests ranged from 64.4-93.2%. The most sensitive assays recognized 95.8-100 % of the sera obtained after 4 weeks or later. Sera drawn at 2-3 weeks were recognized with lower sensitivity indicating that the optimal time point for serologic testing is later than 3 weeks after onset of the disease. Nucleoprotein- and glycoproteinbased assays had similar sensitivity indicating that tests with both antigens are suitable for serological diagnostics. Breakdown of the test results showed that nucleoprotein- and glycoprotein-based tests of comparable sensitivity reacted with different sets of sera. The observation indicates that a combination of nucleoprotein- and glycoprotein-based tests would increase the percentage of positive results.","Schnurra, Carolin; Reiners, Nina; Biemann, Ronald; Kaiser, Thorsten; Trawinski, Henning; Jassoy, Christian",J Clin Virol,,512

Research involving Nipah infectious clones has never been reported to have occured at the WIV. These patient samples have been previously reported to contain reads from several other viruses: Influenza A, Spodoptera frugiperda rhabdovirus and Nipah. Previous authors have interpreted the presence of these virus sequences as indicative of co-infections of the patients in question by these pathogens or laboratory contamination. However, our analysis shows that NiV genes are encapsulated in synthetic vectors, which we infer was for assembly of a NiV infectious clone. In particular, we document the finding of internal N, P-V-W-C and L protein coding sequences as well as coverage of the G and F genes. Furthermore, the format of Hepatitis D virus ribozyme and T7 terminator downstream of the 5-prime end of the NiV sequence is consistent with truncation required at the end of the genome for a full length infectious clone. This indicates that research at WIV was being conducted on an assembled NiV infectious clone. Contamination of patient sequencing reads by an infectious NiV clone of the highly pathogenic Bangladesh strain could indicate a significant breach of BSL-4 protocols. We call on WIV to explain the purpose of this research on infectious clones of Nipah Virus, the full chronology of this work, and to explain how and at what stage of sample preparation this contamination occurred.","Quay, Steven C.; Zhang, Daoyu; Jones, Adrian; Deigin, Yuri",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09112v1.pdf,512
276320,Les étudiants infirmiers au cœur de la crise de la Covid-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the French government has decided a general lockdown. This unprecedented situation has raised concerns about children's and adolescent's mental health. Children and adolescents diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may find this context of restrained activity particularly tricky. The objectives of our study are to gather information about the well-being and global life conditions of children and adolescents with ADHD during the COVID-19 outbreak in France. METHODS: We designed a survey including both open-ended questions and questionnaire items for parents of children and adolescents with ADHD. Parents responded to the following open-ended questions: 1) ""How is your child doing since the lockdown?"" 2) ""How is life at home since the lockdown?"" 3) ""If you had a remote service provision with a mental health professional (e.g. by telephone or video technology), please share your thoughts and any suggestions with us"" 4) ""Please share any other items that you think are important about ADHD symptoms of your child and the lockdown situation"". This survey was posted on social media on the 6th of April and disseminated by French ADHD-parent and patient organizations. The present article reports the descriptive, qualitative and textometrical analyses of the survey. RESULTS: Between day 20 and 30 of lockdown, 538 parents responded to the survey, and we included 533 responses in the final analysis. The vast majority of responders were women 95 % (95 % CI 93,50; 97,18) with children whose mean age was 10,5 (95 % CI 7.58; 13.44). Since the lockdown, 34.71 % (95 % CI 30.70; 38.94) of children experienced a worsening in well-being, 34.33 % (95 % CI 30.34; 38.56) showed no significant changes and 30.96 % (95 % CI 27.09; 35.10) were doing better according to their parents. The thematic analysis showed that an improvement of their children's anxiety was one of the main topics addressed by parents. This improvement related to less school-related strain and flexible schedules that respected their children's rhythm. Improved self-esteem was another topic that parents linked with a lesser exposure of their children to negative feed-back. Parents repeatedly reported both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. However, optimal lockdown life conditions seemed to compensate for the impact of ADHD symptoms (e.g. sufficient space at home, presence of a garden). Some parents reported worsening of general well-being in their children, and this manifested as oppositional/defiant attitudes and emotional outbursts. Parents also cited sleep problems and anxiety in this context. As regards everyday life during lock-down, at-home schooling was another major topic-parents described that their children struggled to complete school-related tasks and that teachers seemed to have forgotten about academic accommodations. The lockdown situation seems to have raised parents' awareness of the role of inattention and ADHD symptoms in their children's learning difficulties. Due to potential selection biases, the results of our survey may not be generalizable to all children and adolescents with ADHD. The main strengths of this rapid survey-based study lies in the reactivity of the participants and the quality and diversity of their responses to the open-ended questions. CONCLUSIONS: According to their parents, most children and adolescents with ADHD experience stability or improvement of their well-being. An improvement in school-related anxiety and the flexible adjustment to the children's' rhythms as well as parents' increased awareness of the difficulties their children experience are among the key topics in parents' descriptions.","Bobo, E; Lin, L; Acquaviva, E; Caci, H; Franc, N; Gamon, L; Picot, M-C; Pupier, F; Speranza, M; Falissard, B; Purper-Ouakil, D",Encephale,,512

In this study, we evaluated and compared 10 commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 rapid serological tests using the STARD methodology (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies). 250 sera from 159 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (collected from 0 to 32 days after onset of symptoms) were tested with rapid serological tests. Control sera (N = 254) were retrieved from pre-COVID periods from patients with other coronavirus infections (N = 11), positive rheumatoid factors (N = 3), IgG/IgM hyperglobulinemia (N = 9), malaria (n = 5), or no documented viral infection (N = 226). All samples were tested using rapid lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) from 10 manufacturers. Only four tests achieved &#8805;98% specificity, with other tests ranging from 75.7%-99.2%. Sensitivities varied by the day of sample collection, from 31.7%-55.4% (Days 0-9), 65.9%-92.9% (Days 10-14), and 81.0%-95.2% (>14 days) after the onset of symptoms, respectively. Only three tests evaluated met French Health Authorities' thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 serological tests (&#8805;90% sensitivity + &#8805;98% specificity). Overall, the performances between tests varied greatly, with only a third meeting acceptable specificity and sensitivity thresholds. Knowing the analytical performance of these tests will allow clinicians and most importantly laboratorians to use them with more confidence, could help determine the general population's immunological status, and may help to diagnose some patients with false-negative RT-PCR results.","Dortet, Laurent; Ronat, Jean-Baptiste; Vauloup-Fellous, Christelle; Langendorf, Céline; Mendels, David-Alexis; Emeraud, Cécile; Oueslati, Saoussen; Girlich, Delphine; Chauvin, Anthony; Afdjei, Ali; Bernabeu, Sandrine; Le Pape, Samuel; Kallala, Rim; Rochard, Alice; Verstuyft, Celine; Fortineau, Nicolas; Roque-Afonso, Anne-Marie; Naas, Thierry",J. clin. microbiol,,512

The theory finds plausibility on the androgen-mediated transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS-2), a key protein for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. We demonstrated reduction of hospitalization rate using a potent non-steroidal antiandrogen (NSAA), proxalutamide, in both females and males COVID-19 outpatients. In this joint exploratory analysis, we aimed to demonstrate whether the efficacy of proxalutamide on mild-to-moderate COVID-19 could be justified by improvements in inflammatory, immunologic, and thrombogenic responses. MethodsThis is a joint post-hoc analysis of two double-blind, placebo-controlled two-arm randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on proxalutamide 200mg/day for seven days for female and male COVID-19 outpatients, respectively, compared to standard of care (SOC), of hematocrit, neutrophils lymphocytes, eosinophils, platelets, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (N/L) ratio, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, ultrasensitive C-reactive protein (usCRP) lactate 1-hour erythrocyte sedimentation rate (1hESR), total testosterone, estradiol, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), oxygen saturation and heart rate measured on days 0, 1 and 7. ResultsA total of 445 subjects were enrolled (268 males and 177 females) between October 21th 2020 and February 28th 2021, with similar baseline characteristics. Neutrophils were lower in proxalutamide group in Day 1 (p = 0.005) and Day 7 (p < 0.0001). Lymphocytes were higher in the proxalutamide group in Day 7 (p = 0.0001).

285406,"Nueva normalidad, vieja precariedad: la crisis pandémica en Santiago de Chile",2020,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has disrupted our regular life. Many state and local authorities have enforced a cordon sanitaire for the protection of sensitive areas. Travelers can only travel across the cordon after being qualified. This paper aims to propose a method to determine the optimal deployment of cordon sanitaire in terms of the number of parallel checkpoints at each entry link for regular epidemic control. A bilevel programming model is formulated where the lower-level is the transport system equilibrium with queueing to predict traffic inflow, and the upper-level is queueing network optimization, which is an integer nonlinear programming. The objective of this optimization is to minimize the total operation cost of checkpoints with a predetermined maximum waiting time. Note that stochastic queueing theory is used to represent the waiting phenomenon at each entry link. A heuristic algorithm is designed to solve the proposed bilevel model where the method of successive averages (MSA) is adopted for the lower-level model, and the genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted for the upper-level model. An experimental study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and algorithm. The results show that the methods can find a good heuristic optimal solution. These methods are useful for policymakers to determine the optimal deployment of cordon sanitaire for hazard prevention and control.","Lin, Hongzhi",Advances in Civil Engineering,,512

Gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based testing holds great potential for this urgent unmet biomedical need. In this review, we describe the most recent advances in AuNP-based viral detection applications. In addition, we discuss considerations for the design of AuNP-based SARS-CoV-2 testings. Finally, we highlight and propose important parameters to consider for the future development of effective AuNP-based testings that would be critical for not only this COVID-19 pandemic, but also potential future outbreaks.

286899,Uso y difusión responsable de la información en pandemia: un imperativo ético/ The responsible use and dissemination of information in a pandemic: an ethical imperative,2020,"Existing deep learning technologies generally learn the features of chest X-ray data generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia. However, the above methods have a critical challenge: data privacy. GAN will leak the semantic information of the training data which can be used to reconstruct the training samples by attackers, thereby this method will leak the privacy of the patient. Furthermore, for this reason that is the limitation of the training data sample, different hospitals jointly train the model through data sharing, which will also cause the privacy leakage. To solve this problem, we adopt the Federated Learning (FL) frame-work which is a new technique being used to protect the data privacy. Under the FL framework and Differentially Private thinking, we propose a FederatedDifferentially Private Generative Adversarial Network (FedDPGAN) to detectCOVID-19 pneumonia for sustainable smart cities. Specifically, we use DP-GAN to privately generate diverse patient data in which differential privacy technology is introduced to make sure the privacy protection of the semantic information of training dataset. Furthermore, we leverage FL to allow hospitals to collaboratively train COVID-19 models without sharing the original data. Under Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, The evaluation of the proposed model is on three types of chest X-ray (CXR) images dataset (COVID-19, normal, and normal pneumonia). A large number of the truthful reports make the verification of our model can effectively diagnose COVID-19 without compromising privacy.","Zhang, Longling; Shen, Bochen; Barnawi, Ahmed; Xi, Shan; Kumar, Neeraj; Wu, Yi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12581v1.pdf,512

288841,"Estimation de l’épuisement des ressources hospitalières attribuable à la COVID-19 en Ontario, au Canada",2020,"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health authorities in India presented a contradictory picture between their role in assisting the state to mitigate the global crisis and dealing coercively with the needs of its diverse populations. Conventionally, public health is viewed as an evidence-based profession that is above politics. Yet national responses to COVID-19 in India reveal the embeddedness of health and illnesses in the larger politics of the state. Although it is still early to assess the full spectrum of damage caused by lack of central-level planning, this article argues against COVID-19 being viewed as a ‘great leveller’. Rather, it suggests that we inhabit somatic societies that regularly employ the vocabulary of pathology/disease to determine social health. Moreover, the Indian experience illustrates how, even during a pandemic, ‘social distancing’ is not an apolitical notion. It becomes a measure for the state to co-opt scientific interventions of risk mitigation and relay them to people as a metaphor for exclusion: thereby exacerbating deeper structural inequities around which access to health and well-being of the population is organised.","Rahman, Sabina Yasmin",Health Soc.

In the present review, we conferred evidence of neurological complications in COVID-19 patients and shed light on the SARS-CoV-2 infection routes including the hematogenous, direct/neuronal, lymphatic tissue or cerebrospinal fluid, or infiltration through infected immune cells, while the underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 invasion to the central nervous system (CNS) was also discussed. In an up-to-date manner, we further reviewed the impact of COVID-19 in developing diverse neurologic manifestations associated with CNS, peripheral nervous system (PNS), skeletal muscle, and also pre-existing neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and myasthenia gravis. Furthermore, we discussed the involvement of key factors including age, sex, comorbidity, and disease severity in exacerbating the neurologic manifestations in COVID-19 patients.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal perinatal mental health in Spain. METHODS: Seven hundred and twenty-four women (N=450 pregnancy, N=274 postpartum) were recruited online during the pandemic. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Satisfaction With Life Scale were administered. Variables related to sociodemographic information, the COVID-19 pandemic, and perinatal care were also assessed. FINDINGS: The results showed that 58% of women reported depressive symptoms. Moreover, 51% of women reported anxiety symptoms. On the other hand, a regression analysis for life satisfaction showed that besides the perception about their own health, marital status or being a health practitioner were also significant predictors during pregnancy. However, perception about baby's health and sleep, perception about their own health, and marital status were significant predictors of life satisfaction during the postpartum stage. DISCUSSION: Women assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic reported high rates of psychological distress. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the need of clinical support during this period. Knowing the routes to both distress and well-being may help maternity services to effectively cope with the pandemic.","Chaves, Covadonga; Marchena, Carlos; Palacios, Beatriz; Salgado, Alfonso; Duque, Almudena",Women and birth (Online),,512

The demand for all types of preparations (topic and oral medications, intravenous solutions) has increased dramatically. This increase has highlighted the shortage of resources allocated to this area, which has made it difficult to meet the high demand for preparations. In addition, the pandemic has revealed the scarcity of research on such basic aspects as agent stability and drug compatibility.

314020,Repeat cesarean section in a COVID-19 positive mother in the United States,2020,"BACKGROUND: The mechanism of bilirubin neurotoxicity is poorly understood. We hypothesize that bilirubin inhibits the function of lipid rafts (LR), microdomains of the plasma membrane critical for signal transduction. To test this hypothesis, we measured the effect of free bilirubin (Bf) between 7.6 and 122.5 nM on LR-dependent functions of L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1). METHODS: Cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) were plated on poly-L-lysine overnight, and neurite length was determined after 1 h treatment with L1 alone or L1 and bilirubin. L1 activation of ERK1/2 was measured in CGN in the presence or absence of bilirubin. The effect of bilirubin on L1 distribution in LR was quantitated, and the localization of bilirubin to LR was determined. RESULTS: The addition of bilirubin to CGN treated with L1 significantly decreased neurite length compared to L1 alone. L1 activation of ERK1/2 was inhibited by bilirubin. Bilirubin redistributed L1 into LR. Bilirubin was associated only with LR-containing fractions of a sucrose density gradient. CONCLUSION: Bf significantly inhibits LR-dependent functions of L1 and are found only associated with LR, suggesting one mechanism by which bilirubin may exert neurotoxicity is through the dysfunction of protein-LR interactions. IMPACT: This article establishes lipid rafts as a target for the neurotoxic effects of bilirubin.This article provides clear evidence toward establishing one mechanism of bilirubin neurotoxicity, where little is understood.This article paves the way for future investigation into lipid raft dependent functions, and its role in neurodevelopmental outcome.Fig. 1BILIRUBIN INHIBITS L1-MEDIATED NEURITE OUTGROWTH AT PHYSIOLOGIC CONCENTRATIONS OF BF.: a Distribution curve of neurite lengths without L1, L1, or L1 plus 5, 10, or 50 µM of bilirubin from a representative experiment. b Bar graph of mean ± SEM neurite lengths of CGN grown without L1, L1, or L1 plus 5, 10, or 50 µM of bilirubin normalized to CGN grown on PLL alone.

315869,Agenda,2021,"Background: During the rapid onset of the pandemic, clinicians transitioned from traditional outpatient practice to virtual modalities for providing routine care to patient panels. Like training programs nationwide, telemedicine training and assessment had not been systematically incorporated into our residency. In response, a scheduled Internal Medicine (IM) Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) was adapted to a remote modality to become virtual care-focused learning experience for trainees and to provide valuable feedback to educators. Methods: Standardized Patients (SPs) rated residents on their communication (including information gathering, relationship development and patient education), patient activation and satisfaction, and telemedicine skills. Analyses included a comparison of domain scores for residents who participated in both the 2020 remote and 2019 in-person OSCEs, and a review of written resident comments about the virtual OSCE. Results: During 2020's video visit OSCE (VOSCE), residents (n = 23) excelled at nonverbal communication but struggled with virtual physical exams and information gathering. In debrief, residents expressed substantial interest in more opportunity to practice virtual visit skills going forward. In comparing scores of the virtual care (2020) OSCE with the in-person (2019) version, the small subset of residents who participated in both assessments (n = 9) performed similarly on communication skills, patient satisfaction and activation. Patient education scores were significantly lower during the virtual care OSCE (P =.008). Conclusion: Our reformulated OSCE accomplished 3 goals including;(1) physically distancing residents from SPs per COVID regulations, (2) providing residents with the opportunity to practice critical virtual visit skills, and (3) alerting our educators to curricular improvement areas. Our methods are useful for other institutions and have applications to the larger medical education community.

316248,Une stratégie « sans autres vagues ¼ pour la gestion de la COVID-19 au Canada,2021,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes high morbidity and mortality in older adults with chronic illnesses. Several trials are currently underway evaluating the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for acute infection. However, polypharmacy predisposes patients to increased risk of drug-drug interactions with hydroxychloroquine and may render many in this population ineligible to participate in trials. We aimed to quantify the degree of polypharmacy and burden of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) that older hospitalized adults are taking that would interact with hydroxychloroquine. METHODS: We reanalyzed data from the cohort of patients 65 years and older enrolled in the MedSafer pilot study. We first identified patients taking medications with potentially harmful drug-drug interactions with hydroxychloroquine that might exclude them from participation in a typical 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) therapeutic trial. Next, we identified medications that were flagged by MedSafer as potentially inappropriate and crafted guidance around medication management if contemplating the use of hydroxychloroquine. RESULTS: The cohort contained a total of 1,001 unique patients with complete data on their home medications at admission. Of these 1,001 patients, 590 (58.9%) were receiving one or more home medications that could potentially interact with hydroxychloroquine, and of these, 255 (43.2%) were flagged as potentially inappropriate by the MedSafer tool. Common classes of PIMs observed were antipsychotics, cardiac medications, and antidiabetic agents. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of medication optimization and deprescribing PIMs in older adults. By acting now to reduce polypharmacy and use of PIMs, we can better prepare this vulnerable population for inclusion in trials and, if substantiated, pharmacologic treatment or prevention of COVID-19.

An electroencephalogram headset allows the detection of brainwaves and the developed web application enhances the process of distance learning. The electrodes of the headset are placed at contact with the user head and monitor the activity of the left and right frontal regions, along with the temporal lobe. Mood, focus, stress, relaxation, engagement, excitement and interest are triggered as numerical values by using the headset. The users provide information about their daily activities, including learning and evaluation processes. According to the study, users had the highest long term attention while using text and illustrations, followed by watching videos. This is caused by the fact that the text contained the code for the programs which were presented in the video. Also, the users feel comfortable while using the application and they started to pay more attention to the connection between stress, health, education and well being. The results triggered by the headset had higher values while students studied for the first time using videos. When they wanted to remember the information, the text and illustrations way of learning was the best option. Based on the study outcomes, the instructional design can be enhanced. Moreover, the results improved as the students became more equilibrated and confident in themselves. Teachers, professors and parents are able to collaborate and enhance training. While studying online under lockdown, students have found the proposed solution to be good because their inner state influences their productivity while solving problems.","Marin, Iuliana",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00472v1.pdf,512

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Measurement of modulation transfer function (MTF) and acquisition of a line pairs phantom were performed. An anthropomorphic lung nodule phantom was scanned with standard (120kVp, 62mAs), low (120kVp, 11mAs), and ultra-low (80kVp, 3mAs) radiation doses. A human volunteer underwent standard (120kVp, 63mAs) and low (120kVp, 11mAs) dose scans after approval by the ethics committee. HR images were reconstructed with 1024 matrix, 300mm field of view and 0.25mm slice thickness using a filtered-back projection (FBP) and two levels of iterative reconstruction (iDose 5 and 9). The conspicuity and sharpness of various lung structures (distal airways, vessels, fissures and proximal bronchial wall), image noise, and overall image quality were independently analyzed by three radiologists and compared to a previous HR lung CT examination of the same volunteer performed with a conventional CT equipped with energy integrating detectors (120kVp, 10mAs, FBP). RESULTS: Ten percent MTF was measured at 22.3lp/cm with a cut-off at 31lp/cm. Up to 28lp/cm were depicted. While mixed and solid nodules were easily depicted on standard and low-dose phantom images, higher iDose levels and slice thicknesses (1mm) were needed to visualize ground-glass components on ultra-low-dose images. Standard dose SPCCT images of in vivo lung structures were of greater conspicuity and sharpness, with greater overall image quality, and similar image noise (despite a flux reduction of 23%) to conventional CT images. Low-dose SPCCT images were of greater or similar conspicuity and sharpness, similar overall image quality, and lower but acceptable image noise (despite a flux reduction of 89%). CONCLUSIONS: A large field-of-view SPCCT prototype demonstrates HR technical capabilities and high image quality for high resolution lung CT in human.","Si-Mohamed, Salim; Boccalini, Sara; Rodesch, Pierre-Antoine; Dessouky, Riham; Lahoud, Elias; Broussaud, Thomas; Sigovan, Monica; Gamondes, Delphine; Coulon, Philippe; Yagil, Yoad; Boussel, Loïc; Douek, Philippe",Diagn Interv Imaging,,512

325906,Caracterisation de l'insuffisance renale aigue chez les patients de reanimation atteints du COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND The proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), used to reduce gastric acid secretion, represent one of the most widely used pharmaceutical classes in the world. Their consumption as a risk factor for the evolution of severe forms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been investigated patients. These risks also appear to be linked to the duration and the dosage. On the other hand, several studies have emerged with regard to the protective or therapeutic effects of these drugs. More and more evidence underlines the immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic role of PPIs. In addition, their ability to alkalize the contents of endosomes and lysosomes serves as an obstacle to the entry of the virus into the host cells.AIMTo identify studies on the relationship between the intake of PPIs and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the main objective of evaluating the outcomes related to severity and mortality. METHODS A literature review was performed in November 2020. The MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases were searched for all relevant articles published in English on this topic. The search terms were identified by means of controlled vocabularies, such as the National Library of Medicine’s MESH (Medical Subject Headings) and keywords. The MESH terms and keywords used were as follows: “COVID-19”, “proton pump inhibitors”, ”PPIs”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “outcomes”, “severity” and “mortality”. The inclusion criteria regarding the studies considered in our analysis were: meta-analysis, casecontrol, hospital-based case-control, population-based case-control, retrospective studies, online survey, as well as cohort-studies, while articles not published as full reports, such as conference abstracts, case reports and editorials were excluded. We tried to summarize and pool all the data if available. RESULTS A total of 9 studies were found that described the use of PPIs, of which only 5 clearly reported the severity and mortality data in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Our pooled incidence analysis of severe events did not differ between patients with and without PPIs (odds ratio 1.65, 95% confidence interval: 0.62-4.35) (P = 0.314), or for mortality (odds ratio 1.77, 95% confidence interval: 0.62-5.03) (P = 0.286). CONCLUSION Detailed and larger case studies are needed to accurately understand the role of PPIs in this viral infection. © The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

The public health systems have consequently been placed under tremendous pressure. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are widely used in patients with cancers. Little is known about the provision of PICCs care amongst cancer patients during this pandemic. METHODS: We studied 156 cancer patients with PICCs treated at the Cancer Center of the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University between January 2020 and March 2020. Their clinical characteristics, social features, psychological characteristics, and PICCs care situations were analyzed. The chi-squared (&#967;2) test or Fisher's exact test were used for univariate analyses. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed using stepwise variable selection. Differences were evaluated using a two-tailed test, and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of 156 patients, 57 (36.5%) experienced delays of PICCs care, and 12 (21.1%) suffered from complications including infection, thrombosis, and mechanical failure. Univariate analysis detected that the increased risk of PICCs care delay was associated with older age (&#8805;30), lower level of education (<9 years), working, taking public transport to the hospital, anxiety about COVID-19, lower social support rating scale (SSRS) score (<30). Multivariate analysis detected level of education, being employed or not, mode of transport, and SSRS score were independent predictive factors for the delay in PICCs care. CONCLUSIONS: Physical aspects, social factors, and psychological status commonly influenced patients' health care seeking behaviors such as PICCs maintenance. An increase in effort is required from patients' families and society to assure optimal care for cancer patients during this pandemic.","Hu, Liyang; Tao, Hongmei; Xu, Xiaolu; Chen, Hui; Chang, Kejie; Pei, Xiaofeng; Hao, Fen; He, Lanman; Chen, Yanni; Liang, Zibin; Luo, Tongtong; Lin, Zhong; Lv, Weize; Long, Fengjiao",Ann Palliat Med,,512

It is the most popular format of point-of-care test (POCT) and quickest and easiest way to detect a targeted molecule. In the combat against COVID-19 pandemic, hundreds of POCTs have been developed and are commercially available now. They are designed to detect either a SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen or IgG and IgM antibodies binding to it. Among the binding antibodies, a special type of functional antibodies that block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 virus and its human receptor, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), are of particular interest to public as well as in vaccination management. However as of today, POCTs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs remain under late stage of development.Scope and method:In this review, we first summarize the importance of awareness and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs in the combat against COVID-19 pandemic. Secondly, we compare the available methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs. Next, we describe challenges in the development of a rapid lateral flow test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs. Finally, we outline its product formats and applications in research and in disease management. Conclusion:Vaccine effectiveness is unknown for an individual unless measured. NAb level is the most viable measurement for vaccine effectiveness or immunity. A broadly accessible NAb POCT is urgently needed.","Wang, Jianfu J; Zhang, Nan; Richardson, Sarah A; Wu, Jin V",Expert Rev Mol Diagn,,512

329179,Modalités pratiques de prise en charge des patients apnéiques par l’ORL durant l’épidémie de COVID-19,2020,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) involving social-isolation strategies such as self-quarantine (SQ) and social-distancing (SD) are useful in controlling the spread of infections that are transmitted through human-to-human contacts, e.g., respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. In the absence of a safe and effective cure or vaccine during the first ten months of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world implemented these social-isolation strategies and other NPIs to reduce COVID-19 transmission. But, individual and public perception play a crucial role in the success of any social-isolation measure. Thus, in spite of governments' initiatives to use NPIs to combat COVID-19 in many countries around the world, individual choices rendered social-isolation unsuccessful in some of these countries. This resulted in huge outbreaks that imposed a substantial morbidity, mortality, hospitalization, economic, etc., toll on human lives. In particular, human choices pose serious challenges to public health strategic decision-making in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. To unravel the impact of this behavioral response to social-isolation on the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, we develop a model framework that integrates COVID-19 transmission dynamics with a multi-strategy evolutionary game approach of individual decision-making. We use this integrated framework to characterize the evolution of human choices in social-isolation as the disease progresses and public health control measures such as mandatory lockdowns are implemented. Analysis of the model illustrates that SD plays a major role in reducing the burden of the disease compared to SQ. Parameter estimation using COVID-19 incidence data, as well as different lockdown data sets from India, and scenario analysis involving a combination of Voluntary-Mandatory implementation of SQ and SD shows that the effectiveness of this approach depends on the type of isolation, and the time and period of implementation of the selected isolation measure during the outbreak.","Ngonghala, Calistus N; Goel, Palak; Kutor, Daniel; Bhattacharyya, Samit",J Theor Biol,,512

This study investigated seven commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays in samples from non-infected individuals and hospitalized patients. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 qualitative serological assays by Abbott (IgG), Beckman (IgG), DiaSorin (IgG), EUROIMMUN (IgG and IgA), Roche and Bio-Rad (Total) were evaluated using specimens collected pre-December 2019 (n=393), from nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) negative patients (n=40), and from 53 patients with COVID-19 by NAAT collected 3-21 days post-onset of symptoms (POS) (N=83). Negative agreement (NA), positive agreement (PA), and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) at prevalences of 5% and 10% were calculated. RESULTS: The overall %NA;95% CI in the negative samples were: Roche 99.8%; 99.3-100.2, Beckman 99.8%; 98.7-100.0, Abbott and Bio-Rad 99.3%; 98.0-99.9, DiaSorin 98.4; 97.2-99.6, EUROIMMUN IgG 97.5%; 95.5-98.7, and EUROIMMUN IgA 79.7%; 75.9-83.5), accounting for positive/equivocal results as false positives.

METHOD: Forty-one PLWH, 41 individuals with PD, and 37 CTL, aged 45-79 years, underwent neuropsychological, psychological, and neurological assessment including depressive and anxiety symptoms, physical (ADL-p) and instrumental (ADL-i) daily activities, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor ADLs (ADL-UPDRS-II), QOL, and cognitive and motor functions. Hierarchical regression analyses assessed the relative contribution of predictors including demographics, disease-related factors, comorbid conditions, and mood-related factors for ADL and QOL scales. RESULTS: PLWH and PD participants reported more depressive symptoms and higher anxiety and worse QOL and ADL-i than CTL. The PD group had greater ADL-p and motor-related ADL-UPDRS-II difficulties than PLWH and CTL groups. In PLWH, medical comorbidities and alcohol use disorder (AUD)/substance use disorder (SUD) histories significantly contributed to poor physical and motor ADLs. Mood scores, particularly depressive symptoms, were independent predictors of poor QOL and most ADLs in both clinical groups, above the contribution of cognitive compromise. CONCLUSIONS: Mood symptoms contribute significantly to poor ADLs and QOL in people aging with chronic diseases such as long-term HIV infection and PD. Comprehensive assessment and treatment of mood symptoms are recommended for ensuring optimal functional independence and life quality.

SARS-CoV-2 is usually detected via real-time RT-PCR. However, as institutions/hospitals deal with increasing numbers of specimens, a simpler detection system is required. Here, we present an ultra-rapid, real-time RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 using the PCR1100 device. Although this tests only one specimen at any one time, the amplification period is <20 min, with maintenance of the sensitivity and specificity of conventional real-time RT-PCR performed using large instruments. The method will be very helpful if SARS-CoV-2 testing is required a few times daily, for example to confirm virus-free status prior to discharge.","Shirato, Kazuya; Nao, Naganori; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Takeda, Makoto; Kageyama, Tsutomu",Jpn. j. infect. dis,,512

METHODS: Patients previously diagnosed with COVID-19 were included, while healthy patients formed the historic control group. All patients underwent an ophthalmological examination, including macular and optic nerve optical coherence tomography. In the case group, socio-demographic data, medical history, and neurological symptoms were collected. RESULTS: One hundred sixty patients were included; 90 recovered COVID-19 patients and 70 controls. COVID-19 patients presented increases in global RNFLT (mean difference 4.3; CI95% 0.8 to 7.7), nasal superior (mean difference 6.9; CI95% 0.4 to 13.4), and nasal inferior (mean difference 10.2; CI95% 2.4 to 18.1) sectors of peripapillary RNFLT. Macular RNFL showed decreases in COVID-19 patients in volume (mean difference -0.05; CI95% -0.08 to -0.02), superior inner (mean difference -1.4; CI95% -2.5 to -0.4), nasal inner (mean difference -1.1; CI95% -1.8 to -0.3), and nasal outer (mean difference -4.7; CI95% -7.0 to -2.4) quadrants. COVID-19 patients presented increased GCL thickness in volume (mean difference 0.04; CI95% 0.01 to 0.07), superior outer (mean difference 2.1; CI95% 0.8 to 3.3), nasal outer (mean difference 2.5; CI95% 1.1 to 4.0), and inferior outer (mean difference1.2; CI95% 0.1 to 2.4) quadrants.

This study aims to examine the current hand hygiene behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, post pandemic behavior intentions, and the relationship between behavior, psychosocial and contextual factors. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 28 May to 12 June 2020, with 896 valid responses obtained from Indonesian citizens over 18 years old. The survey questions included demographic characteristics, individual practices, risk perceptions, attitude, norm factors and ability factors related to hand hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive analysis, chi square and multiple logistic regression tests were used to analyse the data. The results showed that 82.32% of female respondents and 73.37% male respondents reported handwashing practice 8 times or more per day during COVID-19 pandemic. Participants who perceived themselves at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 (OR 7.08, 2.26-22.17), had less negative perception toward the practice (OR 1.93, 1.32-2.82), perceived handwashing as an effective preventive measure (OR 1.77, 1.23-2.54), were female (OR 1.71, 1.21-2.41), perceived a more supportive norm (OR 1.68, 1.15-2.44) and noticed more barriers in access to handwashing facilities (OR 1.57, 1.05-2.36) were more likely to engage in hand hygiene practice more frequently during the pandemic. In conclusion, the majority of respondents did increase their frequency of hand hygiene practices during COVID-19 pandemic. In line with previous studies in other pandemic contexts, sex, perceived susceptibility and effectiveness are important predictors of hand hygiene practices, which are similar to findings from previous studies in other pandemic contexts. Addressing social norm related to the perceived hand hygiene practices of friends and important people is a potential health promotion strategy by creating hand hygiene norms in the community.","Dwipayanti, Ni Made Utami; Lubis, Dinar Saurmauli; Harjana, Ngakan Putu Anom",Front Public Health,,512

341127,International abstracts,2020,"Quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of blood plasma is widely used to investigate perturbed metabolic processes in human diseases. The reliability of biochemical data derived from these measurements is dependent on the quality of the sample collection and exact preparation and analysis protocols. Here, we describe systematically, the impact of variations in sample collection and preparation on information recovery from quantitative proton (1H) NMR spectroscopy of human blood plasma and serum. The effects of variation of blood collection tube sizes and preservatives, successive freeze-thaw cycles, sample storage at -80 °C, and short-term storage at 4 and 20 °C on the quantitative lipoprotein and metabolite patterns were investigated. Storage of plasma samples at 4 °C for up to 48 h, freezing at -80 °C and blood sample collection tube choice have few and minor effects on quantitative lipoprotein profiles, and even storage at 4 °C for up to 168 h caused little information loss. In contrast, the impact of heat-treatment (56 °C for 30 min), which has been used for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, that may be required prior to analytical measurements in low level biosecurity facilities induced marked changes in both lipoprotein and low molecular weight metabolite profiles. It was conclusively demonstrated that this heat inactivation procedure degrades lipoproteins and changes metabolic information in complex ways. Plasma from control individuals and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are differentially altered resulting in the creation of artifactual pseudo-biomarkers and destruction of real biomarkers to the extent that data from heat-treated samples are largely uninterpretable. We also present several simple blood sample handling recommendations for optimal NMR-based biomarker discovery investigations in SARS CoV-2 studies and general clinical biomarker research.","Loo, Ruey Leng; Lodge, Samantha; Kimhofer, Torben; Bong, Sze-How; Begum, Sofina; Whiley, Luke; Gray, Nicola; Lindon, John C; Nitschke, Philipp; Lawler, Nathan G; Schäfer, Hartmut; Spraul, Manfred; Richards, Toby; Nicholson, Jeremy K; Holmes, Elaine",J Proteome Res,,512

Even though a suggestive pathophysiological link between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system and the virus has been proposed, its pathogenic role remains very difficult to be defined. Although COronaVIrus Disease-19 targets preferentially older people with high prevalence of hypertension and extensive use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitors, an independent role for hypertension and its therapies is not defined. In this article, we scrutinize evidence from the most representative available studies in which the potential role of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, specifically angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, was evaluated in the COronaVIrus Disease-19 disease course, with regard to severity of the disease and mortality. We conclude that at this time, the overall available evidence fails to support a pathogenetic speaks against any harmful role for of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitors in COronaVIrus Disease-19. Consequently, we conclude that treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitors should not be discontinued and, therefore, these therapies should not be interrupted.","Volpe, Massimo; Battistoni, Allegra",Int J Cardiol,,512

AIMS: To describe the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and disease control of IBD patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in The Netherlands. METHODS: Between March 17 and July 1, 2020, patients aged 18 years and older with IBD from the Erasmus MC (Rotterdam, The Netherlands) were invited to complete online questionnaires at week 0, 2, 6 and 12. The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Control-8 (IBD-control-8) and the numeric rating scale on fatigue were used. The evolution of the different outcomes over time was measured using mixed models. RESULTS: Of 1151 invited patients, 851 patients (67% CD and 33% UC or IBD-U) participated in the study (response rate 74%). No relevant changes in total scores were found over time for the IBDQ (effect estimate 0.006, 95% CI [- 0.003 to 0.015]) and IBD-control-8 (effect estimate 0.004, 95% CI [0.998-1.011]). There was a slight, increasing trend in fatigue scores over time (effect estimate 0.011, 95% CI [0.004, 0.019]). CONCLUSIONS: This first lock down due to the COVID-19 pandemic in The Netherlands did not impact on the HRQoL and disease control of patients with IBD. Up to date information may have contributed to a stable HRQoL in IBD patients even in an extreme period with restrictions and insecurities.","Paulides, Emma; Pasma, Annelieke; Erler, Nicole S; van Eijk, Rachel L A; de Vries, Annemarie C; van der Woude, C Janneke",Dig. dis. sci,,512

However, many clinicians feel ill equipped to deliver therapy via telehealth, while adhering to evidence-based interventions. This article draws together clinician experiences of the issues that should be attended to, and how to address them within a telehealth framework. METHOD: Seventy clinical colleagues of the authors were emailed and invited to share their concerns online about how to deliver cognitive-behavioral therapy for eating disorders (CBT-ED) via telehealth, and how to adapt clinical practice to deal with the problems that they and others had encountered. After 96 hr, all the suggestions that had been shared by 22 clinicians were collated to provide timely advice for other clinicians. RESULTS: A range of themes emerged from the online discussion. A large proportion were general clinical and practical domains (patient and therapist concerns about telehealth; technical issues in implementing telehealth; changes in the environment), but there were also specific considerations and clinical recommendations about the delivery of CBT-ED methods. DISCUSSION: Through interaction and sharing of ideas, clinicians across the world produced a substantial number of recommendations about how to use telehealth to work with people with eating disorders while remaining on track with evidence-based practice. These are shared to assist clinicians over the period of changed practice.","Waller, Glenn; Pugh, Matthew; Mulkens, Sandra; Moore, Elana; Mountford, Victoria A; Carter, Jacqueline; Wicksteed, Amy; Maharaj, Aryel; Wade, Tracey D; Wisniewski, Lucene; Farrell, Nicholas R; Raykos, Bronwyn; Jorgensen, Susanne; Evans, Jane; Thomas, Jennifer J; Osenk, Ivana; Paddock, Carolyn; Bohrer, Brittany; Anderson, Kristen; Turner, Hannah; Hildebrandt, Tom; Xanidis, Nikos; Smit, Vera",Int J Eat Disord,,512

353008,Recomendaciones para pacientes con cáncer en contexto de pandemia,2020,"In late 2019, the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the viral agent responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Coronaviruses Spike proteins are responsible for their ability to interact with host membrane receptors and different proteins have been identified as SARS-CoV-2 interactors, among which Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and Basigin2/EMMPRIN/CD147 (CD147). CD147 plays an important role in human immunodeficiency virus type 1, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections. In particular, SARS-CoV recognizes the CD147 receptor expressed on the surface of host cells by its nucleocapsid protein binding to cyclophilin A (CyPA), a ligand for CD147. However, the involvement of CD147 in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still debated. Interference with both the function (blocking antibody) and the expression (knock down) of CD147 showed that this receptor partakes in SARS-CoV-2 infection and provided additional clues on the underlying mechanism: CD147 binding to CyPA does not play a role; CD147 regulates ACE2 levels and both receptors are affected by virus infection.

Providers often rely on syndromic management due to prolonged test turnaround times which can result in inappropriate treatment. METHODS: This study retrospectively evaluated chlamydia and gonorrhea treatment accuracy of adults, men and women, aged 18 and older in four urgent cares in Northeast Iowa, using standard NAAT in a 6-month timeframe through medical records review. Seven hundred twenty-two visits were evaluated. RESULTS: 25.8% (n=186/722) of patients were treated at the time of their visit, resulting in 68.8% (n=128/186) over-treatment and 8.2% (n=44/536) under-treatment. Logistic regression analysis found that treatment prescribed without diagnostic test results and the patient-collected vaginal swabs were predictors of inappropriate treatment. Patients who were treated in the clinic were significantly less likely to be treated appropriately compared to patients who were treated later based on test results (OR 0.04, CI 0.02-0.06). Patients that self-collected vaginal swabs had significantly lower odds of being treated appropriately (OR 0.04, CI 0.09-0.80). CONCLUSION: Syndromic management leads to inaccurate treatment of chlamydia and gonorrhea at the time of the initial patient visit. Changes in practice in urgent care are needed in order to improve treatment accuracy by promoting antibiotic stewardship and decreasing forward disease transmission.","Glasgow, Kimberly E",Sex. transm. dis,,512

Knowing what could be in store, the Thai Ministry of Public Health called for the creation of an explicit protocol to determine how these resources are to be rationed in the situation of demand exceeding supply. This paper shares the experience of developing triage criteria and a mechanism for prioritizing intensive care unit resources in a middle-income country with the potential to be applied to other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) faced with a similar (if not more of a) challenge when responding to the global pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, this locally developed guideline would be among the first of its kind from an LMIC setting. In summary, the experience from the Thai protocol development highlights three important lessons. First, stakeholder consultation and public engagement are crucial steps to ensure the protocol reflects the priorities of society and to maintain public trust in the health system. Second, all bodies and actions proposed in the protocol must not conflict with existing laws to ensure smooth implementation and adherence by professionals. Last, all components of the protocol must be compatible with the local context including medical culture, physician-patient relationship, and religious and societal norms.","Archer, Rachel A; Marshall, Aniqa I; Sirison, Kanchanok; Witthayapipopsakul, Woranan; Sriakkpokin, Pisit; Chotchoungchatchai, Somtanuek; Srisookwatana, Orapan; Teerawattananon, Yot; Tangcharoensathien, Viroj",Int J Technol Assess Health Care,,512

Pleural complications are one relevant issue. We aimed in this study to analyse pleural complications, such as pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and empyema, in patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The files of patients who have pleural complications of Covid-19 pneumonia and were consulted about thoracic surgery between March 2020 and December 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The data of the patients were analyzed according to age, gender, length of stay, treatment method for pleural complications, mortality, severity of covid-19 pneumonia, tube thoracostomy duration and presence of a mechanical ventilator. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the study. There were 11 female (35.5%) and 20 male (65.5%) patients. The most common complication was pneumothorax in 20 patients (65%). The median duration of hospitalization was 22 days and the mortality rate was 71%.

360339,Enfoque «Pit Crew¼ en la asistencia de pacientes con sospecha de infección por coronavirus./ [Pit Crew approach in the care of patients with suspected coronavirus infection],2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In early 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic shifted most healthcare to remote delivery methods to protect patients, clinicians, and hospital staff. Such remote care delivery methods include the use of telehealth technologies including clinical video telehealth or telephone visits. Prior to this, research on the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of telehealth applied to rheumatology, or telerheumatology, has been limited. RECENT FINDINGS: Telerheumatology visits were found to be noninferior to in-person visits and are often more time and cost effective for patients. Clinicians and patients both noted the lack of a physical exam in telehealth visits and patients missed the opportunity to have lab work done or other diagnostic tests they are afforded with in-person visits. Overall, patients and clinicians had positive attitudes toward the use of telerheumatology and agreed on its usefulness, even beyond the pandemic. SUMMARY: Although telerheumatology has the potential to expand the reach of rheumatology practice, some of the most vulnerable patients still lack the most basic resources required for a telehealth visit. As the literature on telerheumatology continues to expand, attention should be paid to health equity, the digital divide, as well as patient preferences in order to foster true shared decision-making over telehealth.","Matsumoto, Rachel A; Barton, Jennifer L",Curr Opin Rheumatol,,512

However, genital ulcerations due to hydroxyurea therapy are a rare, and likely underrecognized, adverse effect with only a few cases reported in the literature to date. Ulcers of the lower legs caused by hydroxyurea are associated with a diagnostic delay, and this is likely exacerbated in cases of genital ulceration due to a lack of awareness. Herein we present two cases of painful genital ulceration in patients on hydroxyurea therapy. In the first Case, an 87 year-old male with polycythemia vera developed an ulcer on the scrotum, which was assessed initially through virtual visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, and was refractory to topical and oral antibiotic treatments. The second case was a 79 year-old male with essential thrombocythemia and a history of persistent leg ulcers who developed erosions of the glans penis. Both patients experienced complete resolution within weeks of discontinuing hydroxyurea therapy. In conclusion, genital ulcers and erosions induced by hydroxyrea may be underrecognized in clinical practice, but if identified, withdrawal of hydroxyurea leads to quick resolution of these lesions and the associated pain.","Blum, Amy E; Tsiaras, William G; Kemp, Jacqueline M",J Tissue Viability,,512

Here we aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a candidate COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2, in children and adolescents aged 3-17 years. METHODS: We did a double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial of CoronaVac in healthy children and adolescents aged 3-17 years old at Hebei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Zanhuang (Hebei, China). Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 exposure or infection history were excluded. Vaccine (in 0·5 mL aluminum hydroxide adjuvant) or aluminum hydroxide only (alum only, control) was given by intramuscular injection in two doses (day 0 and day 28). We did a phase 1 trial in 72 participants with an age de-escalation in three groups and dose-escalation in two blocks (1·5 µg or 3·0 µg per injection). Within each block, participants were randomly assigned (3:1) by means of block randomisation to receive CoronaVac or alum only. In phase 2, participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1) by means of block randomisation to receive either CoronaVac at 1·5 µg or 3·0 µg per dose, or alum only. All participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to group allocation. The primary safety endpoint was adverse reactions within 28 days after each injection in all participants who received at least one dose. The primary immunogenicity endpoint assessed in the per-protocol population was seroconversion rate of neutralising antibody to live SARS-CoV-2 at 28 days after the second injection. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04551547. FINDINGS: Between Oct 31, 2020, and Dec 2, 2020, 72 participants were enrolled in phase 1, and between Dec 12, 2020, and Dec 30, 2020, 480 participants were enrolled in phase 2. 550 participants received at least one dose of vaccine or alum only (n=71 for phase 1 and n=479 for phase 2; safety population). In the combined safety profile of phase 1 and phase 2, any adverse reactions within 28 days after injection occurred in 56 (26%) of 219 participants in the 1·5 µg group, 63 (29%) of 217 in the 3·0 µg group, and 27 (24%) of 114 in the alum-only group, without significant difference (p=0·55). Most adverse reactions were mild and moderate in severity. Injection site pain was the most frequently reported event (73 [13%] of 550 participants), occurring in 36 (16%) of 219 participants in the 1·5 µg group, 35 (16%) of 217 in the 3·0 µg group, and two (2%) in the alum-only group. As of June 12, 2021, only one serious adverse event of pneumonia has been reported in the alum-only group, which was considered unrelated to vaccination. In phase 1, seroconversion of neutralising antibody after the second dose was observed in 27 of 27 participants (100·0% [95% CI 87·2-100·0]) in the 1·5 µg group and 26 of 26 participants (100·0% [86·8-100·0]) in the 3·0 µg group, with the geometric mean titres of 55·0 (95% CI 38·9-77·9) and 117·4 (87·8-157·0). In phase 2, seroconversion was seen in 180 of 186 participants (96·8% [93·1-98·8]) in the 1·5 µg group and 180 of 180 participants (100·0% [98·0-100·0]) in the 3·0 µg group, with the geometric mean titres of 86·4 (73·9-101·0) and 142·2 (124·7-162·1). There were no detectable antibody responses in the alum-only groups. INTERPRETATION: CoronaVac was well tolerated and safe and induced humoral responses in children and adolescents aged 3-17 years. Neutralising antibody titres induced by the 3·0 µg dose were higher than those of the 1·5 µg dose. The results support the use of 3·0 µg dose with a two-immunisation schedule for further studies in children and adolescents.

We enrolled 28 patients with acute CSC, 42 patients with chronic CSC, and 40 healthy controls. The presence of ARAs was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using monkey retina as an antigen substrate, while the presence of AECAs was determined using cultivated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and primate skeletal muscle according to the manufacturer's instructions (Euroimmun AG). There were no differences in the prevalence of antibodies against rods, cones, cytoplasmic components of retinal nuclear layer cells, and retinal vessels between the acute and chronic CSC groups and the control group (P = 0.27, P = 0.16, P = 0.71, and P = 0.06, respectively). However, AECAs reactive with HUVECs were observed in 46% of patients with acute CSC, 45% of those with chronic CSC, and 22% of controls, whereas AECAs reactive with the skeletal muscle were present in 46%, 45%, and 15%, respectively (difference between groups: P = 0.045 for HUVECs and P = 0.005 for the skeletal muscle). Furthermore, AECA titers were higher in CSC patients than in controls (P = 0.004). This study provides evidence for the possible involvement of an autoimmune process directed against vessel antigens in the pathogenesis of CSC. AECAs may be more important than ARAs in this disease and may be involved in endothelial damage in the choroidal vessels and choriocapillaris, leading to hyperpermeability, which is central to the pathophysiology of CSC.","Karska-Basta, I; Pociej-Marciak, W; Chrzaszcz, M; Wilanska, J; Jager, M J; Markiewicz, A; Romanowska-Dixon, B; Sanak, M; Kubicka-Trzaska, A",J. physiol. pharmacol,,512

372568,Influencia del confinamiento ocurrido en España debido a la pandemia por el virus SARS-CoV-2 en la adherencia a la dieta mediterránea,2021,"IL-6 is involved both in immune responses and in inflammation, hematopoiesis, bone metabolism and embryonic development. IL-6 plays roles in chronic inflammation (closely related to chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer) and even in the cytokine storm of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acute inflammation during the immune response and wound healing is a well-controlled response, whereas chronic inflammation and the cytokine storm are uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Non-immune and immune cells, cytokines such as IL-1ß, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) and transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#954;B) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) play central roles in inflammation. Synergistic interactions between NF-&#954;B and STAT3 induce the hyper-activation of NF-&#954;B followed by the production of various inflammatory cytokines. Because IL-6 is an NF-&#954;B target, simultaneous activation of NF-&#954;B and STAT3 in non-immune cells triggers a positive feedback loop of NF-&#954;B activation by the IL-6-STAT3 axis. This positive feedback loop is called the IL-6 amplifier (IL-6 Amp) and is a key player in the local initiation model, which states that local initiators, such as senescence, obesity, stressors, infection, injury and smoking, trigger diseases by promoting interactions between non-immune cells and immune cells. This model counters dogma that holds that autoimmunity and oncogenesis are triggered by the breakdown of tissue-specific immune tolerance and oncogenic mutations, respectively. The IL-6 Amp is activated by a variety of local initiators, demonstrating that the IL-6-STAT3 axis is a critical target for treating diseases.","Hirano, Toshio",Int Immunol,,512

The current brief report demonstrates the rapid growth in TMH-V appointments in the weeks following the pandemic declaration within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the largest healthcare system in the United States. Methods: COVID-19 changes in TMH-V appointments were captured during the six weeks following the World Health Organization's pandemic declaration (March 11, 2020-April 22, 2020). Pre-COVID-19 TMH-V encounters were assessed from October 1, 2017 to March 10, 2020. Results: Daily TMH-V encounters rose from 1,739 on March 11 to 11,406 on April 22 (556% growth, 222,349 total encounters). Between March 11-April 22, 114,714 patients were seen via TMH-V, and 77.5% were first-time TMH-V users. 12,342 MH providers completed a TMH-V appointment between March 11-April 22, and 34.7% were first-time TMH-V users. The percentage growth of TMH-V appointments was higher than the rise in telephone appointments (442% growth); in-person appointments dropped by 81% during this time period. Discussion and Conclusions: The speed of VA's growth in TMH-V appointments in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic was facilitated by its pre-existing telehealth infrastructure, including earlier national efforts to increase the number of providers using TMH-V. Longstanding barriers to TMH-V implementation were lessened in the context of a pandemic, during which non-urgent in-person MH care was drastically reduced. Future work is necessary to understand the extent to which COVID-19 related changes in TMH-V use may permanently impact mental health care provision.","Connolly, Samantha L; Stolzmann, Kelly L; Heyworth, Leonie; Weaver, Kendra R; Bauer, Mark S; Miller, Christopher J",Telemed. j. e. health,,512

METHODS: The Canadian Rheumatology Association (CRA) formed a multidisciplinary panel including rheumatologists, researchers, methodologists, vaccine experts, and patients. The panel used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Outcomes were prioritized according to their importance for patients and clinicians. Evidence from the COVID-19 clinical trials was summarized. Indirect evidence for non-COVID-19 vaccines in ARD was also considered. The GRADE evidence-to-decision (EtD) framework was used to develop a recommendation for the use of the 4 COVID-19 vaccines approved in Canada as of March 25, 2021 (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1, and Ad26.COV2.S), over 4 virtual panel meetings. RESULTS: The CRA guideline panel suggests using COVID-19 vaccination in persons with ARD. The panel unanimously agreed that for the majority of patients, the potential health benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential harms in people with ARDs. The recommendation was graded as conditional because of low or very low certainty of the evidence on the effects in the population of interest, primarily due to indirectness and imprecise effect estimates. The panel felt strongly that persons with autoimmune rheumatic diseases who meet local eligibility should not be required to take additional steps compared to people without ARDs to obtain their vaccination. Guidance on medications, implementation, monitoring of vaccine uptake, and research priorities are also provided.

The implementation of safety measures in high-income countries has largely mitigated these risks. However, in many low- and middle- income countries (LMICs), resources to institute safety measures are lacking, increasing the risk of occupational exposures to these hazards. The aim of this scoping review is to map and synthesize the available research on occupational hazards among health care workers in LMICs, identify research gaps and inform policy. Searches for relevant articles were conducted in five electronic databases using a broad range of search terms. The inclusion criteria were: quantitative observational or experimental studies which examined exposure to one or more occupational hazards among health care workers in a LMCI; and the article was published in English in a peer-reviewed journal. A total of 99 studies met the inclusion criteria, and data were extracted from these studies. Large proportions of health care workers in LMICs were exposed to biological hazards (bloodborne pathogens, tuberculosis), psychosocial hazards (workplace violence, burnout, job dissatisfaction), ergonomic hazards (musculoskeletal complaints), and chemical hazards (exposure to latex and antineoplastic drugs). The implementation of risk reduction strategies was suboptimal. The majority of the literature was on biological hazards (48%), and research on other hazards was limited in comparison.

There is some previous evidence that weather may influence the incidence of COVID-19 infection. We assessed the role of meteorological factors including temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) considering the concentrations of two air pollutants, inhalable coarse particles (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the incidence of COVID-19 infections in Finland, located in arctic-subarctic climatic zone. Methods: We retrieved daily counts of COVID-19 in Finland from Jan 1 to May 31, 2020, nationwide and separately for all 21 hospital districts across the country. The meteorological and air quality data were from the monitoring stations nearest to the central district hospital. A quasi-Poisson generalized additional model (GAM) was fitted to estimate the associations between district-specific meteorological factors and the daily counts of COVID-19 during the study period. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the results. Results: The incidence rate of COVID-19 gradually increased until a peak around April 6 and then decreased. There were no associations between daily temperature and incidence rate of COVID-19. Daily average RH was negatively associated with daily incidence rate of COVID-19 in two hospital districts located inland. No such association was found nationwide. Conclusions: Weather conditions, such as air temperature and relative humidity, were not related to the COVID-19 incidence during the first wave in the arctic and subarctic winter and spring. The inference is based on a relatively small number of cases and a restricted time period.","Heibati, Behzad; Wang, Wenge; Ryti, Niilo R I; Dominici, Francesca; Ducatman, Alan; Zhang, Zhijie; Jaakkola, Jouni J K",Front Public Health,,512
389373,ÊTRE UN LEADER en temps de crise,2020,"In November 2019, the NIH held the ""Sensory Nutrition and Disease"" workshop to challenge multidisciplinary researchers working at the interface of sensory science, food science, psychology, neuroscience, nutrition, and health sciences to explore how chemosensation influences dietary choice and health. This report summarizes deliberations of the workshop, as well as follow-up discussion in the wake of the current pandemic. Three topics were addressed: A) the need to optimize human chemosensory testing and assessment, B) the plasticity of chemosensory systems, and C) the interplay of chemosensory signals, cognitive signals, dietary intake, and metabolism. Several ways to advance sensory nutrition research emerged from the workshop: 1) refining methods to measure chemosensation in large cohort studies and validating measures that reflect perception of complex chemosensations relevant to dietary choice; 2) characterizing interindividual differences in chemosensory function and how they affect ingestive behaviors, health, and disease risk; 3) defining circuit-level organization and function that link and interact with gustatory, olfactory, homeostatic, visceral, and cognitive systems; and 4) discovering new ligands for chemosensory receptors (e.g., those produced by the microbiome) and cataloging cell types expressing these receptors. Several of these priorities were made more urgent by the current pandemic because infection with sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the ensuing coronavirus disease of 2019 has direct short- and perhaps long-term effects on flavor perception. There is increasing evidence of functional interactions between the chemosensory and nutritional sciences. Better characterization of this interface is expected to yield insights to promote health, mitigate disease risk, and guide nutrition policy.","Reed, Danielle R; Alhadeff, Amber L; Beauchamp, Gary K; Chaudhari, Nirupa; Duffy, Valerie B; Dus, Monica; Fontanini, Alfredo; Glendinning, John I; Green, Barry G; Joseph, Paule V; Kyriazis, George A; Lyte, Mark; Maruvada, Padma; McGann, John P; McLaughlin, John T; Moran, Timothy H; Murphy, Claire; Noble, Emily E; Pepino, M Yanina; Pluznick, Jennifer L; Rother, Kristina I; Saez, Enrique; Spector, Alan C; Sternini, Catia; Mattes, Richard D",Am. j. clin. nutr,,512

Up to one third of hospitalised patients develop severe pulmonary complications and ARDS. Pulmonary outcomes following COVID-19 are unknown. METHODS: The Swiss COVID-19 lung study is a multicentre prospective cohort investigating pulmonary sequela of COVID-19. We report on initial follow-up 4â months after mild/moderate or severe/critical COVID-19 according to the WHO severity classification. RESULTS: 113 COVID-19 survivors were included (mild/moderate 47, severe/critical 66). We confirmed several comorbidities as risk factors for severe/critical disease. Severe/critical disease was associated with impaired pulmonary function, i.e. diffusing capacity (DLCO) %-predicted, reduced 6-MWD, and exercise-induced oxygen desaturation. After adjustment for potential confounding by age, sex, and BMI, patients after severe/critical COVID-19 had a 20.9 (95% CI 12.4-29.4, p=0.01) lower DLCO %-predicted at follow up. DLCO %-predicted was the strongest independent factor associated with previous severe/critical disease when age, sex, BMI, 6MWD, and minimal SpO2 at exercise, were included in the multivariable model (adjusted odds ratio [OR] per 10%-predicted 0.59 [95% CI 0. 37-0.87], p=0.01). Mosaic hypoattenuation on chest computed tomography at follow-up was significantly associated with previous severe/critical COVID-19 including adjustment for age and sex (adjusted OR 11.7 [95%CI 1.7-239), p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Four months after SARS CoV-2 infection, severe/critical COVID-19 was associated with significant functional and radiological abnormalities, potentially due to small airway and lung parenchymal disease.

Nonetheless, it remains a challenge in HCFs, largely due to lack of high-impact and efficacious interventions. Environmental cues and mobile phone health messaging (mhealth) have the potential to improve HH compliance among HCWs, however, these remain under-studied. Our study will determine the impact of mhealth hygiene messages and environmental cues on HH practice among HCWs in the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area (GKMA). METHODS: The study is a cluster-randomized trial, which will be guided by the behaviour centred design model and theory for behaviour change. During the formative phase, we shall conduct 30 key informants' interviews and 30 semi-structured interviews to explore the barriers and facilitators to HCWs' HH practice. Besides, observations of HH facilities in 100 HCFs will be conducted. Findings from the formative phase will guide the intervention design during a stakeholders' insight workshop. The intervention will be implemented for a period of 4 months in 30 HCFs, with a sample of 450 HCWs who work in maternity and children's wards. HCFs in the control arm will receive innovatively designed HH facilities and supplies. HCWs in the intervention arm, in addition to the HH facilities and supplies, will receive environmental cues and mhealth messages. The main outcome will be the proportion of utilized HH opportunities out of the 9000 HH opportunities to be observed. The secondary outcome will be E. coli concentration levels in 100mls of hand rinsates from HCWs, an indicator of recent fecal contamination and HH failure. We shall run multivariable logistic regression under the generalized estimating equations (GEE) framework to account for the dependence of HH on the intervention. DISCUSSION: The study will provide critical findings on barriers and facilitators to HH practice among HCWs, and the impact of environmental cues and mhealth messages on HCWs' HH practice.

La respuesta de la organización colegial,2020,"Three mechanisms have been proposed to account for COVID-19 associated olfactory dysfunction; obstruction of the olfactory cleft; epithelial injury and infection of the sustentacular supporting cells, which are known to express ACE2, or injury to the olfactory bulb due to axonal transport through olfactory sensory neurones. The absence of ACE2 expression by olfactory sensory neurones has led to the neurotropic potential of COVID-19 to be discounted. While an accumulating body of evidence supports olfactory epithelial injury as an important mechanism, this does not account for all the features of olfactory dysfunction seen in COVID-19; for example the duration of loss in some patients, evidence of changes within the olfactory bulb on MRI imaging, identification of viral particles within the olfactory bulb in post-mortem specimens and the inverse association between severity of COVID-19 and the prevalence of olfactory loss. The recent identification of a second route of viral entry mediated by NRP1 addresses many of these inconsistencies. Expression by the olfactory sensory neurones and their progenitor cells may facilitate direct injury and axonal transport to the olfactory bulb as well as a mechanism for delayed or absent recovery. Expression by regulatory T cells may play a central role in the cytokine storm. Variability in expression by age, race or gender may explain differing morbidity of infection and inverse association between anosmia and severity; in the case of higher expression there may be a higher risk of olfactory function but greater activation of regulatory T cells that may suppress the cytokine storm.","Hopkins, Claire; Lechien, Jerome R; Saussez, Sven",Med Hypotheses,,512

Vaccines are given to healthy multitudes and for this reason, they must adhere to high safety standards. Many question the safety of vaccines developed with the current alacrity, commonly citing potential hypothetical and unknown (and indeed unknowable) side effects. This brief paper will outline the risk of such hypothetical events after a vaccine has gone through the appropriate testing phases and will compare this to estimated death rate from COVID-19 after factoring in asymptomatic cases, using a variety of scenarios and working with estimates of population, case and infection fatality ratios (analysed as Population Fatality Rate, Infection Fatality Ratio and Case Fatality Ratio). Even after factoring in up to 80% of individuals testing positive COVID-19 being asymptomatic, an effective vaccine that completes phase 3 trials having been administered to 20,000 individuals with very few (&#8804;2) or no serious effects is well worth taking.","Grech, Victor; Calleja, Neville",Early Hum Dev,,512

All compounds adsorb at the solid/liquid interface on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and are investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with submolecular resolution. The observed two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular nanopatterns depend only on the sizes and alkoxy periphery of the cyclophanes and are independent of the specific structures of the intraannular bridges. Since the central arylene moieties of the smaller species are oriented perpendicular to the planes of the bicyclophanes, their substituents protrude from the surface by up to 1.6â nm after adsorption. Therefore, these molecules are attractive platforms for addressing the volume phase above the graphite surface.","Henzel, Sebastian; Becker, Steven; Hennen, Daniel; Keller, Tristan J; Bahr, Joshua; Jester, Stefan-S; Höger, Sigurd",,,512

METHODS: Our single-centre; retrospective, study evaluated children with coronavirus disease 2019 disease admitted to the Pediatric Department at Sancaktepe Training and Research Hospital Istanbul, Turkey from 10 March, 2020 to 10 April, 2020. The data including demographics, clinical symptoms, co-morbid diseases, laboratory, radiological findings as well as electrocardiographs of the patients were obtained from our records. Electrocardiograms were evaluated before, one day after and at the termination of the treatment. RESULTS: 21 patients aged 9 to 18 years were evaluated. The median age was 170 months (range 112-214), 51.1% of them were girls and 48.9% were boys. Their laboratory results did not reveal any abnormalities. None of them needed intensive care. We did not detect QT prolongation during or at the termination of the treatment. CONCLUSION: We did not detect QT prolongation during or at the termination of the treatment in our patients due to the fact that they were not severely affected by the disease. Patients were treated in our inpatient clinic and none of them required intensive care. Laboratory results were also insignificant. Furthermore, they did not need other medications.","Tuncer, Tunc; Karaci, Mehmet; Boga, Aysun; Durmaz, Hilal; Guven, Sirin",Cardiol Young,,512

Therefore, there is a significant unmet medical need for a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19. Inflammation is the driving force behind coronavirus infections, and the majority of deaths caused by COVID-19 are the result of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is crucial to control the inflammation as early as possible. To date, numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) products, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and their derivatives (eg, exosomes) for coronavirus infections, which could be applied for the COVID-19. In this review, first, the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic in the present and future of TERM research and products are briefly presented. Then, the recent clinical trials and the therapeutic benefits of MSCs in coronavirus-induced ARDS are critically reviewed. Last, the recent advances in the field of tissue engineering relevant to the coronavirus infections, including three-dimensional platforms to study the disease progression and test the effects of antiviral agents are described. Moreover, the application of biomaterials for vaccine technology, and drug delivery are highlighted. Despite promising results in the preclinical and clinical applications of MSC therapy for coronavirus infections, the controversy still exists, and thus further investigation is required to understand the efficacy of these therapies.","Shafiee, Abbas; Moradi, Lida; Lim, Mayasari; Brown, Jason",Stem cells transl. med.

We screened the fundus of patients with COVID-19 to detect alterations of the retina and its vasculature and to assess possible correlations with clinical parameters. Methods: Cross-sectional study. The presence of retinal alterations in patients with COVID-19 and subjects unexposed to the virus was assessed using fundus photographs and their prevalence was compared. Mean arteries diameter (MAD) and mean veins diameter (MVD) were compared between patients and unexposed subjects with multiple linear regression including age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, smoking/alcohol consumption, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes as covariates. The influence of clinical/lab parameters on retinal findings was tested in COVID-19 patients. Findings: 54 patients and 133 unexposed subjects were enrolled. Retinal findings in COVID-19 included: haemorrhages (9·25%), cotton wools spots (7·4%), dilated veins (27·7%), tortuous vessels (12·9%). Both MAD and MVD were higher in COVID-19 patients compared to unexposed subjects (98·3 ± 15·3 µm vs 91·9 ± 11·7 µm, p = 0.006 and 138·5 ± 21·5 µm vs 123·2 ± 13·0 µm, p<0.0001, respectively). In multiple regression accounting for covariates MVD was positively associated with COVID-19 both in severe (coefficient 30·3, CI95% 18·1-42·4) and non-severe (coefficient 10·3, CI95% 1·6-19·0) cases compared to unexposed subjects. In COVID-19 patients MVD was negatively correlated with the time from symptoms onset (coefficient -1·0, CI 95% -1·89 to -0·20) and positively correlated with disease severity (coefficient 22·0, CI 95% 5·2-38·9). Interpretation: COVID-19 can affect the retina. Retinal veins diameter seems directly correlated with the disease severity. Its assessment could have possible applications in the management of COVID-19.

407380,Imaging features and mechanisms of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19): Study Protocol Clinical Trial (SPIRIT Compliant),2020,"BACKGROUND: Studies on the etiology of respiratory infections among children in Qatar and surrounding countries are limited. OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence and seasonality of RSV, influenza, and other respiratory pathogens among children in Qatar. METHODS: We retrospectively collected and analyzed data of 33,404 children (<15 years) presented with influenza-like illness from 2012 to 2017. RESULTS: At least one respiratory pathogen was detected in 26,138 (78%) of patients. Together, human rhinoviruses (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza viruses comprised nearly two-thirds of all cases, affecting 24%, 19.7%, and 18.5%, respectively. A prevalence of 5-10% was recorded for adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), human bocavirus (HboV), and human coronaviruses (HCoVs). Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), enteroviruses, M. pneumonia, and parechovirus had prevalences below 5%. While RSV, influenza, and HMPV exhibited strong seasonal activity in the winter, HRV was active during low RSV and influenza circulation. The burden of RSV exceeds that of influenza among young age groups, whereas influenza correlated positively with age. Further, HRV, adenovirus, influenza, and RSV infection rates varied significantly between male and females. CONCLUSION: This comprehensive multi-year study provides insights into the etiology of ILI among children in Qatar, which represents the Gulf region. Our results reinforce the significance of active surveillance of respiratory pathogens to improve infection prevention and control strategies, particularly among children.","Al-Romaihi, Hamad E; Smatti, Maria K; Al-Khatib, Hebah A; Coyle, Peter V; Ganesan, Nandakumar; Nadeem, Shazia; Farag, Elmoubasher A; Al Thani, Asmaa A; Al Khal, Abdullatif; Al Ansari, Khalid M; Al Maslamani, Muna A; Yassine, Hadi M",Int J Infect Dis,,512

Countries have adopted non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) to slow down the spread. This study proposes an agent-based model that simulates the spread of COVID-19 among the inhabitants of a city. The agent-based model can be accommodated for any location by integrating parameters specific to the city. The simulation gives the number of total COVID-19 cases. Considering each person as an agent susceptible to COVID-19, the model causes infected individuals to transmit the disease via various actions performed every hour. The model is validated by comparing the simulation to the real data of Ford County, KS, USA. Different interventions, including contact tracing, are applied on a scaled-down version of New York City, USA, and the parameters that lead to a controlled epidemic are determined. Our experiments suggest that contact tracing via smartphones with more than 60% of the population owning a smartphone combined with city-wide lockdown results in the effective reproduction number (R t ) to fall below 1 within 3 weeks of intervention. For 75% or more smartphone users, new infections are eliminated, and the spread is contained within 3 months of intervention. Contact tracing accompanied with early lockdown can suppress the epidemic growth of COVID-19 completely with sufficient smartphone owners. In places where it is difficult to ensure a high percentage of smartphone ownership, tracing only emergency service providers during a lockdown can go a long way to contain the spread.

However, it needs nasopharyngeal swabs, expensive instruments and expertise. It even causes PCR errors. METHODS: We validated the antibody assay (Roche) in 36 followed patients and 1879 controls (medical staffs). RESULTS: Of 1879 medical staffs, only two (0.11%) were positive by Cut off Index (COI; 1.0) (mean ± SD, 0.094 ± 0.047). Thirty six patients were composed of three groups; Group A,4 from Diamond Princess cruise ship, Group B, 2 infected in Africa, and Group C, 30 infected in Japan. PCR assays were conducted at outside laboratories before and repeated in house after hospitalized. Of 36 at admission, positive antibody was seen in 4/4 from the ship, 0/2 from Africa, and 5/30 from Japan. Two from Africa showed the increase of COI and became positive on days 8 and 13. Thirty Japanese was divided in two groups, e.g., 23 showed dynamic increase of COI up to 84.4 within 3 days while active virus replication present (Group C). In remaining 7 (7/30, 23%) (Group C'), no rise of antibody nor positive in house PCR assays, indicative of false positive results of PCR at the beginning. CONCLUSION: This antibody testing has a wide dynamic ranges of COI and, thus, could be utilized in the early infection phase. This may also compliment and even help to avoid possible PCR errors. Therefore, this can serve as a powerful diagnostic tool, needed in the frontline of the clinic and hospitals.","Omata, Masao; Hirotsu, Yosuke; Sugiura, Hiroki; Maejima, Makoto; Nagakubo, Yuki; Amemiya, Kenji; Hayakawa, Miyoko; Tsutsui, Toshiharu; Kakizaki, Yumiko; Mochizuki, Hitoshi; Miyashita, Yoshihiro",J. microbiol. immunol. infect,,512

With little knowledge of COVID-19 virus, very few published reports on surgical outcomes; hospitals stopped elective surgery, whilst emergency surgery was offered only after exhausting all conservative treatment modalities. This study presents our experience of outcomes of emergency appendectomies performed during the pandemic. Methods - Prospectively we collected data on 132 patients in peak pandemic period from 1st March to 5th June 2020 and data compared with 206 patients operated in similar period in 2019. Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, pre-operative events, investigations, surgical management, postoperative outcomes and complications were analysed. Results - Demographics and ASA grades of both cohorts were comparable. In study cohort 84.4% and 96.7% in control cohort had laparoscopic appendicectomy. Whilst the study cohort had 13.6% primary open operations, control cohort had 5.3%. Mean length of stay and early post-operative complications (&lt;30 days) were similar in both cohorts apart from surgical site infections (p = 0.02) and one mortality in study cohort. Conclusion - In these overwhelming pandemic times, although conservative treatment of acute appendicitis is an option, a proportion of patients will need surgery. Our study shows that with careful planning and strict theatre protocols, emergency appendicectomy can be safely offered with minimal risk of spreading COVID-19 infection. These observations warrant further prospective randomised studies.

Our aim was to provide a comprehensive account of all hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in England during the early phase of the pandemic and to identify the factors that influenced mortality as the pandemic evolved. METHODS: This was a retrospective exploratory analysis using the Hospital Episode Statistics administrative dataset. All patients aged 18 years or older in England who completed a hospital stay (were discharged alive or died) between March 1 and May 31, 2020, and had a diagnosis of COVID-19 on admission or during their stay were included. In-hospital death was the primary outcome of interest. Multilevel logistic regression was used to model the relationship between death and several covariates: age, sex, deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation), ethnicity, frailty (Hospital Frailty Risk Score), presence of comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index items), and date of discharge (whether alive or deceased). FINDINGS: 91â541 adult patients with COVID-19 were discharged during the study period, among which 28â200 (30·8%) in-hospital deaths occurred. The final multilevel logistic regression model accounted for age, deprivation score, and date of discharge as continuous variables, and sex, ethnicity, and Charlson Comorbidity Index items as categorical variables. In this model, significant predictors of in-hospital death included older age (modelled using restricted cubic splines), male sex (1·457 [1·408-1·509]), greater deprivation (1·002 [1·001-1·003]), Asian (1·211 [1·128-1·299]) or mixed ethnicity (1·317 [1·080-1·605]; vs White ethnicity), and most of the assessed comorbidities, including moderate or severe liver disease (5·433 [4·618-6·392]). Later date of discharge was associated with a lower odds of death (0·977 [0·976-0·978]); adjusted in-hospital mortality improved significantly in a broadly linear fashion, from 52·2% in the first week of March to 16·8% in the last week of May. INTERPRETATION: Reductions in the adjusted probability of in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients over time might reflect the impact of changes in hospital strategy and clinical processes. The reasons for the observed improvements in mortality should be thoroughly investigated to inform the response to future outbreaks. The higher mortality rate reported for certain ethnic minority groups in community-based studies compared with our hospital-based analysis might partly reflect differential infection rates in those at greatest risk, propensity to become severely ill once infected, and health-seeking behaviours.

Beyond the immediate delay a backlog for future patients is expected. Such delays can lead to disease progression. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop guidance on criteria for prioritization for surgery and reconfiguring management pathways for non-metastatic stage of prostate cancer who opt for surgical treatment. A second aim was to identify the infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to achieve low likelihood of COVID-19 hazard if radical prostatectomy was to be carried out during the outbreak and whilst the disease is endemic. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: An accelerated consensus process and systematic review. We conducted a systematic review of the evidence on COVID-19 and reviewed international guidance on prostate cancer. These were presented to an international prostate cancer expert panel (n=34) through an online meeting. The consensus process underwent three rounds of survey in total. Additions to the second- and third-round surveys were formulated based on the answers and comments from the previous rounds. OUTCOME MEASURES: Consensus opinion was defined as &#8805;80% agreement, which were used to reconfigure the prostate cancer pathways. RESULTS: Evidence on the delayed management of patients with prostate cancer is scarce. There was 100% agreement that prostate cancer pathways should be reconfigured and develop measures to prevent nosocomial COVID-19 for patients treated surgically. Consensus was reached on prioritization criteria of patients for surgery and management pathways for those who have delayed treatment. IPC measures to achieve a low likelihood of nosocomial COVID-19 were coined as ""COVID-19 cold sites"". CONCLUSION: Re-configuring management pathways for prostate cancer patients is recommended if significant delay (>3-6 months) in surgical management is unavoidable. The mapped pathways provide guidance for such patients. The IPC processes proposed provide a framework for providing radical prostatectomy within an environment with low COVID-19 risk during the outbreak or when the disease remains endemic. The broader concepts could be adapted to other indications beyond prostate cancer surgery.","Tandogdu, Zafer; Collins, Justin; Shaw, Greg; Rohn, Jenifer; Koves, Bela; Sachdeva, Ashwin; Ghazi, Ahmed; Haese, Alexander; Mottrie, Alex; Kumar, Anup; Sivaraman, Ananthakrishnan; Tewari, Ashutosh; Challacombe, Benjamin; Rocco, Bernardo; Giedelman, Camilo; Wagner, Christian; Rogers, Craig G; Murphy, Declan G; Pushkar, Dmitry; Ogaya-Pinies, Gabriel; Porter, Jim; Ramesh Seetharam, Kulthe; Graefen, Markus; Orvieto, Marcelo A; Covas Moschovas, Marcio; Schatloff, Oscar; Wiklund, Peter; Coelho, Rafael; Valero, Rair; de Reijke, Theo M; Ahlering, Thomas; Rogers, Travis; van der Poel, Henk G; Patel, Vipul; Artibani, Walter; Wagenlehner, Florian; Nathan, Senthil; Erik Bjerklund Johansens, Truls; Hawkey, Peter; Kelly, John",BJU Int,,512

Currently affecting more than 5 000 000 individuals worldwide, COVID-19 is most commonly associated with symptoms caused by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). As the number of infected individuals increases, we are learning that not only lungs, but also other organs can be affected by the virus. The gastrointestinal symptoms, for example diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea or abdominal pain, are frequent in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, alimentary tract symptoms may precede the respiratory presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and inappropriate management of infected patients. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid can be detected in faeces of infected patients and rectal swabs are even reported to remain positive for a longer period of time than nasopharyngeal swabs. Here, we aim to provide an update on the gastrointestinal involvement of COVID-19 presenting the symptoms that can be encountered in infected patients. We address the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which also was found in the gastrointestinal tract.

Nationally representative, cross-sectional household surveys were conducted in Haiti, Malawi, Nigeria, Zambia, and Uganda among girls and young women aged 13 to 24 years. A stratified three-stage cluster sample design was used. Respondents were interviewed to assess prevalence of sexual violence, pregnancy related to the first or most recent experience of forced or pressured sex, relationship to perpetrator, mean age at sexual debut, mean age at pregnancy related to forced or pressured sex, and prevalence of forced/coerced sexual debut. Frequencies, weighted percentages, and weighted means are presented. The lifetime prevalence of forced or pressured sex ranged from 10.4% to 18.0%. Among these adolescent girls and young women, the percentage who experienced pregnancy related to their first or most recent experience of forced or pressured sex ranged from 13.2% to 36.6%. In three countries, the most common perpetrator associated with the first pregnancy related to forced or pressured sex was a current or previous intimate partner. Mean age at pregnancy related to forced or pressured sex was similar to mean age at sexual debut in all countries. Preventing sexual violence against girls and young women will prevent a significant proportion of adverse effects on health, including unintended pregnancy. Implementation of strategies to prevent and respond to sexual violence against adolescent girls and young women is urgently needed.","Stamatakis, Caroline E; Sumner, Steven A; Massetti, Greta; Kress, Howard; Basile, Kathleen C; Marcelin, Louis Herns; Cela, Toni; Wadonda-Kabondo, Nellie; Onotu, Dennis; Ogbanufe, Obinna; Chipimo, Peter J; Conkling, Martha; Apondi, Rose; Aluzimbi, George",J Interpers Violence,,512

We present a case of a 22-year-old nulliparous woman 31 weeks pregnant, with significant clinical SARS-CoV-2 disease, in the setting of negative nasopharyngeal PCR testing but positive IgG antibodies. Case presentation: This was a 22-year-old patient 31 weeks pregnant who presented with fever, tachycardia, and subsequently preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and pulmonary emboli with multifocal pneumonia. The patient underwent three negative SARS-CoV-2 tests via nasopharyngeal PCR testing during her hospital stay as well as a negative workup for fever. After a cesarean section for worsening maternal status after 7 days of hospitalization, the patient was admitted for worsening clinical status to the SICU. At the time of SICU admission patient was found to have serum IgG positive antibodies and was managed with intubation, antibiotics, and anticoagulation. Patient eventually left hospital against medical advice on hospital day 16 on oral antibiotics but was found to be recovering well at later outpatient follow up. Conclusions: Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 remains a complicated picture in the setting of testing limitations. This case highlights an antepartum clinical presentation of severe SARS-CoV-2 and recommends a high clinical suspicion for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and initiation of treatment in the pregnant population, even in the presence of negative nasopharyngeal PCR testing.","Fuchs, A.; Harris, L.; Huber, A.; Heiligenstein, M.; Heiselman, C.; Herrera, K.; Garretto, D.",Case Reports in Perinatal Medicine,,512

This study aims to measure France's global competitiveness for international clinical trials (CT) and assess its strengths and areas of excellence. METHODS: A descriptive and comparative analysis was conducted using the data from both the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for the 2015-2019 period and those reported in a national web-based database (OSCAR) involving the major pharmaceutical companies operating in France in 2018-2019. OSCAR allows to describe the administrative authorization and starting process for all drug trials conducted in France. RESULTS: Among 8607 worldwide drug trials initiated in 2019, 34.3% (n=2.954) were funded exclusively by pharmaceutical companies (52.1% in France). On average, France was involved in 10.5% of all global industrial CTs launched over 2018-2019, still ranking in the 4th position among European countries. Early-phase trials represented 17.3% of trials conducted by the drug companies in France, versus 25% in Germany and 29% in United Kingdom. Oncology remains an area of excellence in France with 18.7% of all worldwide CTs conducted in this therapeutic area over the study period involving at least some French centres, ranking France 2nd among European countries. The median of total deadline before the first patient inclusion of 204 days in 2018-2019 with no marked improvement as compared to 2016-2017 period. However, the delay getting initial trial authorization was slightly reduced and an overall deadline of 167 days was observed for CTs entered the pilot phase initiated recently by the European regulation. CONCLUSION: After ten difficult years, areas of excellence, such as oncology and rare diseases and more recently, the outstanding mobilization for the COVID-19 research, have enabled France to maintain its pharmaceutical research. Furthermore, a set of additional decisions would strengthen this position in the next years.","d039,; Andon, Anne; Galaup, Ariane; Fabron, Cecile; Detournay, Bruno; Borel, Thomas",Therapie,,512

Lessons from the peer-to-peer accommodation hosts in China in responses to COVID-19,2020,"Covid19 is a worldwide pandemic challenge that started in Wuhan, China and spread to almost all countries on the planet within a few months. The causative virus was found to be highly contagious and, until now, considerably difficult to contain. A look at the epidemiological distribution of the disease over the planet has raised a number of questions whose answers could help us understand the behavior of the virus and consequently leads us to possible means of limitation of its spread or even flattening of the curve of morbidity and mortality. After the third decade of life, there is a progressive decline of growth hormone (GH) secretion by approximately 15% for every decade of adult life. The data from highly affected countries suggest a more aggressive course in the elderly, a double-time affection of males more than females, and the vulnerability of some risk groups of patients. Our observation is that GH deficiency is a common factor in all vulnerable patient groups. We think that there is a need for studying the role of growth hormone in the unique epidemiological pattern of Covid-19 so that it might help in the early detection and management of the high-risk groups as appropriate.","Elkarow, Mohamed Hamdy; Hamdy, Amr",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,512

The emerging disease spread rapidly, due to the movement of infectious persons to some other regions, which has been witnessed in case of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). So, the networks and the epidemiology of directly transmitted infectious diseases are fundamentally linked. Motivated by the recent empirical evidence on the dispersal of infected individuals among the patches, we present the epidemic model SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) in which the population is divided into patches which form a network and the patches are connected through mean-field diffusive coupling. The corresponding unstable epidemiology classes will be synchronized and achieve stable state when the patches are coupled. Apart from synchronization and stability, the coupled model enables a range of rhythmic processes such as birhythmicity and rhythmogenesis which have not been investigated in epidemiology. The stability of Disease Free Equilibrium (or Endemic Equilibrium) is attained through cessation of oscillation mechanism namely Oscillation Death (OD) and Amplitude Death (AD). Corresponding to identical and non-identical epidemiology classes of patches, the different steady states are obtained and its transition is taking place through Hopf and transcritical bifurcation.","Verma, Tina; Gupta, Arvind Kumar",Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul,,512

452789,Qualité de vie des patients asthmatiques au cours de la pandémie COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: A key clinical feature of COVID-19 is a deep inflammatory state known as ""cytokine storm"" and characterized by high expression of several cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, including IL-6 and IL-8. A direct consequence of this inflammatory state in the lungs is the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), frequently observed in severe COVID-19 patients. The ""cytokine storm"" is associated with severe forms of COVID-19 and poor prognosis for COVID-19 patients. Sulforaphane (SFN), one of the main components of Brassica oleraceae L. (Brassicaceae or Cruciferae), is known to possess anti-inflammatory effects in tissues from several organs, among which joints, kidneys and lungs. PURPOSE: The objective of the present study was to determine whether SFN is able to inhibit IL-6 and IL-8, two key molecules involved in the COVID-19 ""cytokine storm"". METHODS: The effects of SFN were studied in vitro on bronchial epithelial IB3-1 cells exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein). The anti-inflammatory activity of SFN on IL-6 and IL-8 expression has been evaluated by RT-qPCR and Bio-Plex analysis. RESULTS: In our study SFN inhibits, in cultured IB3-1 bronchial cells, the gene expression of IL-6 and IL-8 induced by the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2. This represents the proof-of-principle that SFN may modulate the release of some key proteins of the COVID-19 ""cytokine storm"". CONCLUSION: The control of the cytokine storm is one of the major issues in the management of COVID-19 patients.

455803,Impact de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur les violences domestiques,2021,"Vast amount of research has been recently conducted to discover drugs for efficacious treatment of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The ambiguity about using Chloroquine/ Hydroxychloroquine to treat this illness was a springboard towards new methods for improving the adequacy of these drugs. The effective treatment of COVID-19 using Zinc complexes as add-on to Chloroquine/ Hydroxychloroquine has received major attention in this context. The current studies have shed a light on molecular docking and molecular dynamics methodologies as powerful techniques in establishing therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19 pandemic. We are proposing some zinc compounds coordination to Chloroquine/ Hydroxychloroquine in order to enhance their activity. The molecular docking calculations showed that Zn(QC)Cl2(H2O) has the least binding energy -7.70 Kcal /mol then Zn(HQC)Cl2(H2O) -7.54 Kcal /mol. The recorded hydrogen bonds were recognized in the strongest range of H Bond category distances. Identification of binding site interactions revealed that the interaction of Zn(QC)Cl2(H2O)with the protease of COVID-19 results in three hydrogen bonds, while Zn(HQC)Cl2(H2O) exhibited a strong binding to the main protease receptor by forming eight hydrogen bonds. The dynamic behavior of the proposed complexes was revealed by molecular dynamics simulations. The outcomes obtained from Molecular dynamics calculations approved the stability of Mpro-Zn(CQ/HCQ)Cl2H2O systems. These findings recommend Zn (CQ) Cl2H2O and Zn (HCQ) Cl2H2O as potential inhibitors for COVID-19 Mpro.","Hussein, R K; Elkhair, H M",J Mol Struct,,512

In order to gain insight into the emergence, evolution and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, a comprehensive analysis of genome composition and codon usage of ßCoV circulating in China was performed. A biased nucleotide composition was found for SARS-CoV-2 genome. This bias in genomic composition is reflected in its codon and amino acid usage patterns. The overall codon usage in SARS-CoV-2 is similar among themselves and slightly biased. Most of the highly frequent codons are A- and U-ending, which strongly suggests that mutational bias is the main force shaping codon usage in this virus. Significant differences in relative synonymous codon usage frequencies among SARS-CoV-2 and human cells were found. These differences are due to codon usage preferences.","Tort, Fernando L; Castells, Matías; Cristina, Juan",Virus Res,,512

475700,Second Life: Comme espace de sociabilité pendant la pandémie de COVID-19,2021,"We study the evolution of two mutually interacting games with both pairwise games as well as the public goods game on different topologies. On 2d square lattices, we reveal that the game-game interaction can promote the cooperation prevalence in all cases, and the cooperation-defection phase transitions even become absent and fairly high cooperation is expected when the interaction goes to be very strong. A mean-field theory is developed that points out new dynamical routes arising therein. Detailed analysis shows indeed that there are rich categories of interactions in either individual or bulk scenario: invasion, neutral, and catalyzed types; their combination puts cooperators at a persistent advantage position, which boosts the cooperation. The robustness of the revealed reciprocity is strengthened by the studies of model variants, including asymmetrical or time-varying interactions, games of different types, games with time-scale separation, different updating rules etc. The structural complexities of the underlying population, such as Newman--Watts small world networks, Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random networks, and Barab\'asi--Albert networks, also do not alter the working of the dynamical reciprocity. In particular, as the number of games engaged increases, the cooperation level continuously improves in general. Our work thus uncovers a new class of cooperation mechanism and indicates the great potential for human cooperation where concurrent issues are so often seen in the real world.","Liang, Rizhou; Wang, Qinqin; Zhang, Jiqiang; Zheng, Guozhong; Ma, Lin; Chen, Li",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00360v2.pdf,512

This evidence-based viewpoint will address two questions: (a) are individuals with underlying cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. high blood pressure or diabetes) or overt disease (e.g. coronary heart disease, heart failure, kidney disease) more likely to develop severe Covid-19 and to die than those without underlying conditions? (b) does the regular use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) make patients more likely to get infected and to die of Covid-19? With a necessary cautionary note that the evidence around the links between Covid-19 and cardiovascular disease is accruing at a fast pace, to date we can conclude that: (a) the greater susceptibility of individuals with underlying cardiovascular conditions to develop more severe Covid-19 with higher mortality rate is likely to be confounded, in part, by age and the type of co-morbidities. Patients with heart failure or chronic kidney disease might show an excess risk; (b) neither ACE-i nor ARB are associated with greater risk of SARS-Cov2 infection, or severity or risk of death in patients with Covid-19.

Identifying risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity could help to direct these efforts. This study aimed to estimate the associations between demographic factors and social behaviors and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test. METHODS: In September 2020, we randomly sampled Indiana University Bloomington undergraduate students. Participants completed a cross-sectional online survey about demographics, SARS-CoV-2 testing history, relationship status, and risk behaviors. Additionally, during a subsequent appointment, participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a fingerstick procedure and SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG rapid assay kit. We used unadjusted modified Poisson regression models to evaluate the associations between predictors of both SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 infection history. RESULTS: Overall, 1,076 students were included in the serological testing analysis, and 1,239 students were included in the SARS-CoV-2 infection history analysis. Current seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 4.6% (95% confidence interval: 3.3%, 5.8%). Prevalence of self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection history was 10.3% (95% confidence interval: 8.6%, 12.0%).

However, the relationship between abdominal obesity and CXR severity score is not fully explored. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the association of different adiposity indexes, including waist circumference and body mass index (BMI), with CXR severity score in 215 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Results: Patients with abdominal obesity had significantly higher CXR severity scores (Figure 1A) and higher rates of these scores than those without abdominal obesity (P&lt;0.001;P=0.001, respectively) while there were no significant differences between BMI classes (P=0.104;P=0.271, respectively) (Figure 1B). Waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio correlated more closely with CXR severity score than BMI (r=0.43, P&lt;0.001;r=0.41, P&lt;0.001;r=0.17, P=0.012, respectively). The AUCs for waist circumference and WHtR were significantly higher than those for BMI for distinguishing a high CXR severity score (≥8) (0.68 [0.60-0.75] and 0.67 [0.60-0.74] vs 0.58 [0.51-0.66], P=0.001) (Figure 2). Multivariable analysis indicated abdominal obesity (risk ratio: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.25-2.45, P&lt;0.001), bronchial asthma (risk ratio: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.07-2.81, P=0.026) and oxygen saturation at admission (risk ratio: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.97, P&lt;0.001) as the only independent predictors of a high CXR severity score. Conclusion: Abdominal obesity might predict a high CXR severity score better than general obesity in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Therefore, in hospital clinical practice waist circumference should be assessed and patients with abdominal obesity should be monitored closely.","Basilico, S.; Dubini, C.; Capitanio, G.; Secchi, F.; Milani, V.; Boveri, S.; Schiaffino, S.; Morricone, L.; Sardellli, F.; Prandoni, I.; Corsi Romanelli, M.

In fact, Spike structure and function is known to be highly important for cell infection as well as for entering the brain. Growing evidence indicates that different types of coronaviruses not only affect the respiratory system, but they might also invade the central nervous system (CNS). However, very little evidence has been so far reported on the presence of COVID-19 in the brain, and the potential exploitation, by this virus, of the lung to brain axis to reach neurons has not been completely understood. In this Article, we assessed the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequence, structure, and electrostatic potential using computational approaches. Our results showed that the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are highly similar, sharing a sequence identity of 77%. In addition, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is slightly more positively charged than that of SARS-CoV since it contains four more positively charged residues and five less negatively charged residues which may lead to an increased affinity to bind to negatively charged regions of other molecules through nonspecific and specific interactions. Analysis the S protein binding to the host ACE2 receptor showed a 30% higher binding energy for SARS-CoV-2 than for the SARS-CoV S protein. These results might be useful for understanding the mechanism of cell entry, blood-brain barrier crossing, and clinical features related to the CNS infection by SARS-CoV-2.","Hassanzadeh, Kambiz; Perez Pena, Helena; Dragotto, Jessica; Buccarello, Lucia; Iorio, Federico; Pieraccini, Stefano; Sancini, Giulio; Feligioni, Marco",ACS Chem Neurosci,,512

However, they seldom receive palliative care with the burden of support falling to hostel staff. AIM: To evaluate a model embedding palliative specialists, trained as 'homelessness champions', into hostels for two half-days a month to provide support to staff and residents and facilitate a multidisciplinary approach to care. DESIGN: An exploratory qualitative design. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Four homeless hostels in London, UK, including nine hostel managers/support staff and seven palliative care specialists (five nurses and two social workers). RESULTS: Benefits to introducing the model included: developing partnership working between hostel staff and palliative care specialists, developing a holistic palliative ethos within the hostels and improving how hostel staff seek support and connect with local external services. Challenges to implementation included limited time and resources, and barriers related to primary care. CONCLUSION: This is the first evaluation of embedding palliative care specialists within homeless hostels. Inequity in health and social care access was highlighted with evidence of benefit of this additional support for both hostel staff and residents. Considering COVID-19, future research should explore remote ways of working including providing in-reach support to homelessness services from a range of services and organisations.","Armstrong, Megan; Shulman, Caroline; Hudson, Briony; Brophy, Niamh; Daley, Julian; Hewett, Nigel; Stone, Patrick",Palliat Med,,512

These passengers often remain subclinical, but they are not silent. We address their routes of entry, mechanisms of persistence, tissue specificity, and potential to cause long-term behavioral changes and/or immunosuppression in mammals, where rabies virus is the exemplar. We extend the discussion to Herpesviridae, Coronaviridae, and Toxoplasma, as well as to diverse bacteria and yeasts, and debate the advantages and disadvantages that endozoite infection might afford to the host and to the ecosystem. We provide a clinical perspective in which endozoites are implicated in neurodegenerative disease, anxiety/depression, and schizophrenia.

499451,Réorganisation innovante d'un SAU lors de la crise sanitaire,2021,"Compact walkable environments with greenspace support physical activity and reduce the risk for depression and several obesity-related chronic diseases, including diabetes and heart disease. Recent evidence confirms that these chronic diseases increase the severity of COVID-19 infection and mortality risk. Conversely, denser transit supportive environments may increase risk of exposure to COVID-19 suggesting the potential for contrasting chronic versus infectious disease impacts of community design. A handful of recent studies have examined links between density and COVID-19 mortality rates reporting conflicting results. Population density has been used as a surrogate of urban form to capture the degree of walkability and public transit versus private vehicle travel demand. The current study employs a broader range of built environment features (density, design, and destination accessibility) and assesses how chronic disease mediates the relationship between built and natural environment and COVID-19 mortality. Negative and significant relationships are observed between built and natural environment features and COVID-19 mortality when accounting for the mediating effect of chronic disease. Findings underscore the importance of chronic disease when assessing relationships between COVID-19 mortality and community design. Based on a rigorous simulation-assisted random parameter path analysis framework, we further find that the relationships between COVID-19 mortality, obesity, and key correlates exhibit significant heterogeneity. Ignoring this heterogeneity in highly aggregate spatial data can lead to incorrect conclusions with regards to the relationship between built environment and COVID-19 transmission. Results presented here suggest that creating walkable environments with greenspace is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease and/or COVID-19 infection and mortality.","Frank, Lawrence D.; Wali, Behram",Sustainable Cities and Society,,512

The data on age- and sex-wise cases, deaths and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and public health interventions in the Nordic region through November 10, 2020, were obtained from respective countries' health ministries. Sweden accounted for 60.59% of cases (162â 240 of 267â 768 cases) and 81% of deaths (6057 of 7477 cases) in the Nordic region. The incidence rate for the Nordic region was 989.59 per 100â 000, varying from 327.30 per 100â 000 in Finland to 1616.51 per 100â 000 in Sweden, and the mortality rate for the region was 27.63 per 100â 000, ranging from 5.3 per 100â 000 in Norway to 60.35 per 100â 000 in Sweden. The case-fatality ratio of the Nordic region was 2.79%. Females were more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than males (52.30% vs 47.66%), while males had a greater proportion of deaths (54.7%) and ICU need (71.99%) than females. It is imperative to continue with social distancing, mandatory masks, testing, prohibition of mass gatherings, isolation of confirmed cases, and preventing the importation of cases from other countries to avoid the further resurgence of cases.","Nanda, Mehak; Sharma, Rajesh",Int J Health Serv,,512

METHODS: Mothers aged &#8805; 18 years with a breast-fed infant &#8804; 18 months of age during the COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing, China, completed a questionnaire. Descriptive analysis of lockdown consequences was performed and predictors of these outcomes were examined using stepwise linear regression. RESULTS: Of 2233 participants, 29.9%, 20.0% and 34.7% felt down, lonely, and worried, respectively, during the lockdown; however, 85.3% felt able to cope. Poorer maternal mental health was predicted by maternal (younger age, higher education) and infant (older age, lower gestation) characteristics, and social circumstances (husband unemployed or working from home, receiving advice from family, having enough space for the baby, living close to a park or green space). Conversely, better maternal mental health was predicted by higher income, employment requiring higher qualifications, more personal space at home, shopping or walking > once/week and lack of impact of COVID-19 on job or income. Mothers with higher education, more bedrooms, fair division of household chores and attending an online mother and baby group > once/week reported better coping. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight maternal characteristics and circumstances that predict poorer mental health and reduced coping which could be used to target interventions in any future public health emergencies requiring social restrictions.","Wei, Zhuang; Gao, Ming-Yue; Fewtrell, Mary; Wells, Jonathan; Yu, Jin-Yue",World J Pediatr,,512

We propose a more encompassing Microbial Theory of Health that will have implications for the way that we address our relationship with microbes, including hygiene policy and community-based infection control practices. METHODS: This paper considers theories over the last 30 years that have impacted hygiene policy and consumer practice, from the Germ Theory of Disease and the Hygiene Hypothesis, to the Microbial Theory of Health, including the concept of Bidirectional Hygiene. Here we present a high-level review of the literature on pathogen transmission and the cycle of infection in the home and everyday settings. RESULTS: Targeted hygiene is an evidence-based hygiene policy that is employed to prevent transmission of pathogens and the transmission of infectious diseases through targeting only sites, surfaces, and practices that are considered high risk for pathogen transmission. Targeted hygiene also discourages the indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum microbicides for lower-risk activities and surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: The Microbial Theory of Health, including age-appropriate and health-appropriate hygiene practices for home and everyday life, should usher in a new era in which pathogen reduction can be accomplished without indiscriminate elimination of potentially beneficial microbes from the human and environmental microbiomes.","Scott, Elizabeth A; Bruning, Elizabeth; Nims, Raymond W; Rubino, Joseph R; Ijaz, Mohammad Khalid",Am J Infect Control,,512

This report outlines how the ambulatory clinical practices of a large U.S. hospital system optimized its electronic health records (EHR) framework to better record e-cigarettes used by patients. The new EHR section for e-cigarette information was implemented for outpatient appointments. During a 30-week evaluation period post-implementation, 638,804 patients (12 yrs and older) completed ambulatory appointments within the health system; of these, the new section contained e-cigarette use information for 37,906 (6%) patients. Among these patients, 1005 (2.7%) were identified as current e-cigarette users (current every day or current some day e-cigarette use), 941 (2.5%) were reported as former e-cigarette users, and 35,960 (94%) had never used e-cigarettes. A separate EHR section to document e-cigarette use is feasible within existing clinical practice models. Utilization of the new section was modest in routine clinical practice, indicating the need for more intensive implementation strategies that emphasize the health effects of e-cigarette use, and how consistent ascertainment could improve clinical practice.","Jose, Thulasee; Hays, J Taylor; Warner, David O",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,512

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a self-efficacy theory-based health information technology intervention implemented through blood control and patient self-management. DESIGN: A clinical randomized waitlist-controlled trial. METHODS: The study was conducted at a medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. A total of 60 subjects were randomly assigned to either the immediate intervention (experimental) group or the waitlist control group. The primary endpoint was systolic blood pressure at 3 months; secondary end points included self-management behavior and QOL. Treatment for the immediate intervention group lasted 3 months, while the waitlist control group received routine care for the first 3 months, at which point they crossed over to the intervention arm and received the same intervention as the experimental group for another 3 months. Both groups were evaluated by questionnaires and physiological measurements at both 3 and 6 months postadmission. The results were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure significantly improved for the intervention group participants at 3 months, when there was also significant improvement in self-management behavior and QOL. There was no significant or appreciable effect of time spent in the waitlist condition, with treatments in the two conditions being similarly effective. CONCLUSION: The use of a theory-based health information technology treatment compared with usual care resulted in a significant improvement in systolic blood pressure, self-management behavior, and QOL in patients with coronary artery disease. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This treatment would be a useful strategy for clinical care of cardiovascular disease patients, improving their disease self-management. It also may help guide further digital health care strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hong, Pei-Chen; Chen, Kuan-Jung; Chang, Yue-Cune; Cheng, Shu-Meng; Chiang, Hui-Hsun",J Nurs Scholarsh,,512

511233,"Conseils sur le port du masque dans le cadre de la COVID-19 : orientations provisoires, 6 avril 2020",2020,"Newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of an ongoing global pandemic leading to severe respiratory disease in humans. SARS-CoV-2 targets epithelial cells in the respiratory tract and lungs, which can lead to amplified chloride secretion and increased leak across epithelial barriers, contributing to severe pneumonia and consolidation of the lungs as seen in many COVID-19 patients. There is an urgent need for a better understanding of the molecular aspects that contribute to SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenesis and for the development of approaches to mitigate these damaging pathologies. The multifunctional SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) protein contributes to virus assembly/egress, and as a membrane protein, also possesses viroporin channel properties that may contribute to epithelial barrier damage, pathogenesis, and disease severity. The extreme C-terminal (ECT) sequence of E also contains a putative PDZ-domain binding motif (PBM), similar to that identified in the E protein of SARS-CoV-1. Here, we screened an array of GST-PDZ domain fusion proteins using either a biotin-labeled WT or mutant ECT peptide from the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Notably, we identified a singular specific interaction between the WT E peptide and the second PDZ domain of human Zona Occludens-1 (ZO1), one of the key regulators of TJ formation/integrity in all epithelial tissues. We used homogenous time resolve fluorescence (HTRF) as a second complementary approach to further validate this novel modular E-ZO1 interaction. We postulate that SARS-CoV-2 E interacts with ZO1 in infected epithelial cells, and this interaction may contribute, in part, to tight junction damage and epithelial barrier compromise in these cell layers leading to enhanced virus spread and severe dysfunction that leads to morbidity. Prophylactic/therapeutic intervention targeting this virus-host interaction may effectively reduce airway and/or gastrointestinal barrier damage and mitigate virus spread.","Shepley-McTaggart, Ariel; Sagum, Cari A; Oliva, Isabela; Rybakovsky, Elizabeth; DiGuilio, Katie; Liang, Jingjing; Bedford, Mark T; Cassel, Joel; Sudol, Marius; Mullin, James M; Harty, Ronald N",PLoS One,,512

This study compares psychological symptoms among these two groups. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 938 HCWs from various medical fields working in the leading general hospitals of Alborz province, Iran, were selected using a multistage sampling method. The participants had contact with COVID-19 patients. Post-traumatic stress disorder-8 (PTSD-8) is a validated questionnaire that we used to evaluate PTSD symptoms along with its subscales, including intrusion, avoidance, and hypervigilance. Also, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 questionnaire was used to assess the severity of the aforementioned conditions in HCWs. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare psychological symptoms in infected and non-infected HCWs. RESULTS: Among 938 included HCWs, 55 had a history of confirmed COVID-19 infection. Prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, intrusion, hypervigilance, and avoidance among infected HCWs were significantly higher in comparison to non-infected HCWs. In the multivariate logistic model, history of COVID-19 infection among HCWs was associated with a significantly increased risk of anxiety, depression, stress, intrusion, hyper-vigilance, and avoidance.

522407,Opinion de comité de la SOGC – COVID-19 pendant la grossesse,2020,"The presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials in wastewater has become a matter of grave for many countries of the world. Wastewater based epidemiology, in this context, emerged as an important tool in developed countries where proper sewage system is available. Due to the recent shift in the spread of the infection from urban to rural areas, it is now equally important to develop a similar mechanism for rural areas as well. Considering the urgency of the issue a study was conducted in 14 districts of Bangladesh and a total of 238 sewage samples were collected in two different periods from December 2020 to January 2021. We are the first to propose a surveillance system for both urban and rural areas where a proper sewage system is absent. Based on RT-PCR analysis of the water samples, in more than 92% of cases, we found the presence of the SARS-COV-2 gene (ORF1ab, N, and Internal Control-IC). The trend of Ct value varies for different study locations. The spread of genetic material for on-site ({Delta}m = 0.0749) sanitation system was found more prominent than that of off-site sewage system ({Delta}m = 0.0219); which indicated the shift of genetic material from urban to rural areas. Wastewater samples were also measured for physicochemical parameters, including pH (6.30 - 12.50) and temperature (22.10 - 32.60) {o}C. The highest viral titer of 1975 copy/mL in sewage sample was observed in a sample collected from the isolation ward of the SARS-COV-2 hospital. Additionally, a correlation was found between bacterial load and SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials. The results indicated the association of increased Ct values with decreasing number of patients and vice versa. The findings reported in this paper contributed to the field of wastewater-based epidemiology dealing with SARS-COV-2 surveillance for developing countries where proper sewage system is absent and highlighting some of the challenges associated with this approach in such settings.

BACKGROUND The importance of nutrition care in health is well recognised, with poor nutrition behaviour contributing to many million deaths annually and to less resilience to COVID 19. Nurses as the largest health professional group are ideally positioned to provide basic nutrition care. DESIGN Integrative Review METHODS: Whittemore & Knafl's integrative review methodology guided this review. Appropriate search terms were used in seven databases (PubMed, Medline, Embase, ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health, the Royal College of Nursing Journals, Scopus) for Undergraduate nurses' nutrition knowledge during the period 2010-2020. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. RESULTS Of the 250 studies identified, ten studies met the inclusion criteria: seven studies also investigated nurses' eating patterns and health habits. Two themes emerged from data synthesis and analysis. Nursing students lack sufficient nutrition knowledge to develop the professional capacity to provide effective nutrition care to patients; nursing students' eating patterns and health habits suggest insufficient nutrition knowledge for appropriate selfcare. CONCLUSION Improvements in undergraduate nutrition care are required. Consideration should be given to the inclusion of nutrition experts to guide nurse educators to develop and implement innovative nutrition care programmes.","Laing, Bobbi B; Crowley, Jennifer",Nurse education in practice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34237509/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nepr.2021.103137,512

Whereas vaccine-derived immunity develops over time, neutralizing monoclonal-antibody treatment provides immediate, passive immunity and may limit disease progression and complications. METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, a cohort of ambulatory patients with mild or moderate Covid-19 who were at high risk for progression to severe disease to receive a single intravenous infusion of either a neutralizing monoclonal-antibody combination agent (2800 mg of bamlanivimab and 2800 mg of etesevimab, administered together) or placebo within 3 days after a laboratory diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The primary outcome was the overall clinical status of the patients, defined as Covid-19–related hospitalization or death from any cause by day 29. RESULTS: A total of 1035 patients underwent randomization and received an infusion of bamlanivimab–etesevimab or placebo. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 53.8±16.8 years, and 52.0% were adolescent girls or women. By day 29, a total of 11 of 518 patients (2.1%) in the bamlanivimab–etesevimab group had a Covid-19–related hospitalization or death from any cause, as compared with 36 of 517 patients (7.0%) in the placebo group (absolute risk difference, −4.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], −7.4 to −2.3; relative risk difference, 70%; P<0.001). No deaths occurred in the bamlanivimab–etesevimab group; in the placebo group, 10 deaths occurred, 9 of which were designated by the trial investigators as Covid-19–related. At day 7, a greater reduction from baseline in the log viral load was observed among patients who received bamlanivimab plus etesevimab than among those who received placebo (difference from placebo in the change from baseline, −1.20; 95% CI, −1.46 to −0.94; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among high-risk ambulatory patients, bamlanivimab plus etesevimab led to a lower incidence of Covid-19–related hospitalization and death than did placebo and accelerated the decline in the SARS-CoV-2 viral load.

601597,Collectivités : lieu de rencontre virale,2014-02-20,"BACKGROUND: Multiinflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel and rare inflammatory disorder associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in school-age children. Reports in the past year have suggested a multisystem pathophysiology characterized by hyperinflammation, gastrointestinal distress, and cardiovascular complications. Clinical laboratory investigations, including routine blood testing for inflammatory (e.g., C-reactive protein, ferritin) and cardiac (e.g., troponin, brain natriuretic peptides) markers have provided insight into potential drivers of disease pathogenesis, highlighting the role of the laboratory in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with similar conditions (e.g., Kawasaki disease, macrophage activating syndrome). CONTENT: While few studies have applied high-dimensional immune profiling to further characterize underlying MIS-C pathophysiology, much remains unknown regarding predisposing risk factors, etiology, and long-term impact of disease onset. The extent of autoimmune involvement is also unclear. In the current review, we summarize and critically evaluate available literature on potential pathogenic mechanisms underlying MIS-C onset and discuss the current and anticipated value of various laboratory testing paradigms in MIS-C diagnosis and monitoring. SUMMARY: From initial reports, it is clear that MIS-C has unique inflammatory signatures involving both adaptive and innate systems. Certain cytokines, inflammatory markers, and cardiac markers assist in the differentiation of MIS-C from other hyperinflammatory conditions. However, there are still major gaps in our understanding of MIS-C pathogenesis, including T cell, B cell, and innate response. It is essential that researchers not only continue to decipher initial pathogenesis but also monitor long-term health outcomes, particularly given observed presence of circulating autoantibodies with unknown impact.","Bohn, Mary Kathryn; Yousef, Peter; Steele, Shannon; Sepiashvili, Lusia; Adeli, Khosrow",J Appl Lab Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34463724/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jalm/jfab114,512
602349,L'activité principale à distance en période de covid19: quel impact?,2021-08-13,"The inability to communicate how infectious diseases are transmitted in human environments has triggered avoidance of interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We define a metric, Effective ReBreathed Volume (ERBV), that encapsulates how infectious pathogens transport in air. This measure distinguishes environmental transport from other factors in the chain of infection, thus allowing quantitative comparisons of the riskiness of different situations for any pathogens transported in air, including SARS-CoV-2. Particle size is a key factor in transport, removal onto surfaces, and elimination by mitigation measures, so ERBV is presented for a range of exhaled particle diameters: 1 m, 10 m, and 100 m. Pathogen transport is enhanced by two separate but interacting effects: proximity and confinement. Confinement in enclosed spaces overwhelms proximity after 10-15 minutes for all but the largest particles. Therefore, we review plausible strategies to reduce the confinement effect. Changes in standard ventilation and filtration can reduce person-to-person transport of 1-m particles (ERBV1) by 13-85% in residential and commercial situations. Deposition to surfaces competes with intentional removal for 10-m and 100-m particles, so the same interventions reduce ERBV10 by only 3-50%, and ERBV100 is unaffected. Determining transmission modes is critical to identify intervention effectiveness, and would be accelerated with prior knowledge of ERBV. When judiciously selected, the interventions examined can provide substantial reduction in risk, and the conditions for selection are identified. The framework of size-dependent ERBV supports analysis and mitigation decisions in an emerging situation, even before other infectious parameters are well known.","Bond, T.

Recognizing and exploring the ubiquity of generations is important, especially because evidence for their existence is, at best, scant. In this article, we aim to achieve two goals that are targeted at answering the broad question: “What accounts for the ubiquity of generations despite a lack of evidence for their existence and impact?” First, we explore and “bust” ten common myths about the science and practice of generations and generational differences. Second, with these debunked myths as a backdrop, we focus on two alternative and complementary frameworks—the social constructionist perspective and the lifespan development perspective—with promise for changing the way we think about age, aging, and generations at work. We argue that the social constructionist perspective offers important opportunities for understanding the persistence and pervasiveness of generations and that, as an alternative to studying generations, the lifespan perspective represents a better model for understanding how age operates and development unfolds at work. Overall, we urge stakeholders in organizational science and practice (e.g., students, researchers, consultants, managers) to adopt more nuanced perspectives grounded in these models, rather than a generational perspective, to understand the influence of age and aging at work.","Rudolph, Cort W.; Rauvola, Rachel S.; Costanza, David P.; Zacher, Hannes",J Bus Psychol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10869-020-09715-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901173/,512

This research developed a novel framework explicating airline workers' career turnover decision formation by considering the influence of perceived risks of virus infection and job instability during the COVID-19. A quantitative approach using a survey method was utilized to attain research goals. Our empirical findings revealed that airline image, attitude, and commitment have a significant influence on employee career turnover intention. Both attitude and commitment were identified as essential mediators. In addition, perceived risks of virus infection and job instability significantly moderated the relationships among attitude, commitment, and employee career turnover intention. The effectiveness of the proposed theoretical framework for career turnover intention was demonstrated. Our findings help researchers and entrepreneurs find effectual ways to lower competent workers’ career turnover and raise their approach behaviors in a post-COVID-19 world.","Han, Heesup; Koo, Bonhak; Ariza-Montes, Antonio; Lee, Youngseok; Kim, Hye-Ran",Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhtm.2021.08.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1447677021001248; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1447677021001248,512
604747,Les professionnels de santé face à la pandémie de la maladie à coronavirus (COVID-19): quels risques pour leur santé mentale?,2020-04-22,"As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many therapists and patients have been required to switch to online sessions in order to continue their treatments. Online psychotherapy has become increasingly popular, and although its efficacy seems to be similar to face-to-face encounters, its capacity to support the implicit nonverbal and embodied aspects of the therapeutic relationship has been questioned and remains understudied. OBJECTIVES: To study how embodied and intersubjective processes are modified in online psychotherapy sessions. DESIGN: Taking the enactive concept of participatory sense-making as a guiding thread, we designed an interpretative phenomenological analysis to examine the experiences of embodiment in online therapy. METHODS: We conducted phenomenological semi-structured interviews with patients and therapists who have recently switched from face-to-face encounters to online modality. RESULTS: Adjustments in verbal and nonverbal behavior, gaze behavior, management of silences, and displacements of non-intentional and pre-reflective patterns onto reflective ones are reported as necessary to compensate for changes introduced in the online modality. CONCLUSIONS: From an enactive perspective, such adaptations manifest regulatory processes aimed at sustaining interactive dynamics and coordinating the primordial tension between relational and individual norms in social encounters. PRACTITIONER POINTS: We examine different aspects of embodiment that practitioners should take into account when switching from face-to-face to online encounters with their clients. Online communication systems can alter aspects of the therapeutic relationship, such as its structure, its fragility, and its significance. Video calls afford new forms of intervention such as integrating the experience of patients with their self-image, incorporating information about their habitual environment into the process, and adopting less confrontational therapeutic styles.","García, Enara; Di Paolo, Ezequiel A; De Jaegher, Hanne",Psychol. psychother,https://doi.org/10.1111/papt.12359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34390129/,512

There is limited knowledge on how terrorist attacks can be detrimental to access to healthcare services. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of terrorist attacks on the utilisation of maternal healthcare services by examining the case of Burkina Faso. METHODS: This longitudinal quasi-experimental study uses multiple interrupted time series analysis. Utilisation of healthcare services data was extracted from the National Health Information System in Burkina Faso. Data span the period of January 2013–December 2018 and include all public primary healthcare centres and district hospitals. Terrorist attack data were extracted from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project. Negative binomial regression models were fitted with fixed effects to isolate the immediate and long-term effects of terrorist attacks on three outcomes (antenatal care visits, of facility deliveries and of cesarean sections). RESULTS: During the next month of an attack, the incidence of assisted deliveries in healthcare facilities is significantly reduced by 3.8% (95% CI 1.3 to 6.3). Multiple attacks have immediate effects more pronounced than single attacks. Longitudinal analysis show that the incremental number of terrorist attacks is associated with a decrease of the three outcomes. For every additional attack in a commune, the incidence of cesarean sections is reduced by 7.7% (95% CI 4.7 to 10.7) while, for assisted deliveries, it is reduced by 2.5% (95% CI 1.9 to 3.1) and, for antenatal care visits, by 1.8% (95% CI 1.2 to 2.5). CONCLUSION: Terrorist attacks constitute a new barrier to access of maternal healthcare in Burkina Faso. The exponential increase in terrorist activities in West Africa is expected to have negative effects on maternal health in the entire region.","Druetz, Thomas; Browne, Lalique; Bicaba, Frank; Mitchell, Matthew Ian; Bicaba, Abel",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978211/,512

The objective of this research is to quantify such excess deaths, partitioned by age group and gender. Study Design Data analysis. Methods Excess deaths by age and gender are estimated using provisional death data available from the CDC over the time period March 1, 2020 through May 30, 2020. Previous year fatality and population data are used as the benchmark. Results Several of the eighteen age and gender cohorts experienced statistically significant excess deaths. The results also indicate that for one of the age and gender cohorts, Covid-19 has been protective. Conclusions There have been more excess deaths in several age group and gender cohorts during the first three months of the pandemic, beyond direct deaths directly attributable to Covid-19. These Non-Covid excess deaths are most apparent in the 25 to 44 age group for females, and 15 to 54 age group for men.

METHODS: From August 2020 to November 2020, 43,399 patients were screened in our laboratory for COVID-19 diagnostic by RT-qPCR using nasopharyngeal swab. Overall, 4,691 of the 43,399 were found to be positive, and 200 were retrieved for RAD testing allowing comparison of diagnostic accuracy between RAD and RT-qPCR. Cycle threshold (Ct) and time from symptoms onset (TSO) were included as covariates. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR-, and LR+ of RAD compared with RT-qPCR were 72% (95%CI 62%–81%), 99% (95% CI95%–100%), 99% (95%CI 93%–100%), and 78% (95%CI 70%–85%), 0.28 (95%CI 0.21–0.39), and 72 (95%CI 10–208) respectively. Sensitivity was higher for patients with Ct ≤ 25 regardless of TSO: TSO ≤ 4 days 92% (95%CI 75%–99%), TSO > 4 days 100% (95%CI 54%–100%), and asymptomatic 100% (95%CI 78–100%). Overall, combining RAD and RT-qPCR would allow reducing from only 4% the number of RT-qPCR needed. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the risk of misdiagnosing COVID-19 in 28% of patients if RAD is used alone. A stepwise analysis that combines RAD and RT-qPCR would be an efficient screening procedure for COVID-19 detection and may facilitate the control of the outbreak.","Halfon, Philippe; Penaranda, Guillaume; Khiri, Hacène; Garcia, Vincent; Drouet, Hortense; Philibert, Patrick; Psomas, Christina; Delord, Marion; Retornaz, Frédérique; Charpin, Caroline; Gonzales, Thomas; Pegliasco, Hervé; Allardet-Servent, Jérôme",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34555117/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257817,512

After recessionary shocks, investors look for ways to diversify their systematic risks. We investigate Canadian fixed income funds’ excess returns and dollar fund flow and show that the funds significantly underperform bond markets throughout the study period after controlling for fund characteristics and macroeconomic factors. Consistent with previous studies, we find that this underperformance is more apparent during market downturns. Indicating a spiral relationship, these results suggest that institutional investors perform poorly during financial crises, which is also observable in the volatility patterns in dollar fund flow. We also find that the flow is positively related to the crisis period, indicating that the dollar fund flow in fixed income funds reported a positive value during the recession, signifying an inflow.","Samarbakhsh, Laleh; Shah, Meet",J Econ Finan,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12197-021-09541-z,512

Intensive support teams (ISTs) have been recommended to provide high-quality responsive care aimed at avoiding unnecessary admissions and reducing lengthy inpatient stays in England. We have identified two models of ISTs (model 1: enhanced provision and model 2: independent provision). This study aims to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the two models of ISTs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A cohort of 226 adults with ID displaying behaviour that challenges who receive support from ISTs from each model will be recruited and assessed at baseline and 9 months later to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness between models. The primary outcome is reduction in challenging behaviour measured by the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist-Community (ABC-C). The mean difference in change in ABC score between the two IST models will be estimated from a multilevel linear regression model. Secondary outcomes include mental health status, clinical risk, quality of life, health-related quality of life, level of functioning and service use. We will undertake a cost-effectiveness analysis taking both a health and social care and wider societal perspective. Semistructured interviews will be conducted with multiple stakeholders (ie, service users, paid/family carers, IST managers/staff) to investigate the experience of IST care as well as an online survey of referrers to capture their contact with the teams.

The closely related polysaccharide heparin, the widely used anticoagulant drug, which is structurally similar to HS and is a common experimental proxy, can be expected to mimic the properties of HS. Heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses if added exogenously, including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses if added exogenously, including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here, we show that the addition of heparin to Vero cells between 6.25 - 200 μg.ml−1, which spans the concentration of heparin in therapeutic use, and inhibits invasion by SARS-CoV-2 at between 44 and 80%. We also demonstrate that heparin binds to the Spike (S1) protein receptor binding domain and induces a conformational change, illustrated by surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopy studies. The structural features of heparin on which this interaction depends were investigated using a library of heparin derivatives and size-defined fragments. Binding is more strongly dependent on the presence of 2-O or 6-O sulphation, and the consequent conformational consequences in the heparin structure, than on N-sulphation. A hexasaccharide is required for conformational changes to be induced in the secondary structure that are comparable to those that arise from heparin binding. Enoxaparin, a low molecular weight clinical anticoagulant, also binds the S1 RBD protein and induces conformational change. These findings have implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin as well as for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the Coronaviridae.","Mycroft-West, Courtney J.; Su, Dunhao; Pagani, Isabel; Rudd, Timothy R.; Elli, Stefano; Guimond, Scott E.; Miller, Gavin; Meneghetti, Maria C.

Testing the influence of human disturbance would ideally need experimental approach, however, in cities, this is challenging at relevant spatial and temporal scales. Thus, to better understand the ecological effects of human activity, we exploited the opportunity that the city-wide lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic provided during the spring of 2020. We assessed changes in reproductive success of great tits (Parus major) at two urban habitats affected strikingly differently by the ‘anthropause’, and at an unaffected forest site. Our results do not support that urban great tits benefited from reduced human mobility during the lockdown. First, at one of our urban sites, the strongly (− 44%) reduced human disturbance in 2020 (compared to a long-term reference period) did not increase birds’ reproductive output relative to the forest habitat where human disturbance was low in all years. Second, in the other urban habitat, recreational human activity considerably increased (+ 40%) during the lockdown and this was associated with strongly reduced nestling body size compared to the pre-COVID reference year. Analyses of other environmental factors (meteorological conditions, lockdown-induced changes in air pollution) suggest that these are not likely to explain our results. Our study supports that intensified human disturbance can have adverse fitness consequences in urban populations. It also highlights that a few months of ‘anthropause’ is not enough to counterweight the detrimental impacts of urbanization on local wildlife populations.","Seress, Gábor; Sándor, Krisztina; Vincze, Ernő; Pipoly, Ivett; Bukor, Boglárka; Ágh, Nóra; Liker, András",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34480051/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96858-8,512

The theories of the origin of life on Earth shed light on the possible origin of primitive viruses or virus-like genetic elements in our biosphere. Some features of present day viruses, notably error-prone replication, might be a consequence of the selective forces that mediated their ancestral origin. Two views on the role of viruses in our biosphere predominate: viruses considered as opportunistic, selfish elements, and viruses considered as active participants in the construction of the cellular world via lateral transfers of genes.

Since Reinemann et al. demonstrated the reliability and validity of RTR with physical input devices in laboratory experimental study designs in this journal 15 years ago, measurement technology has experienced an instrumental change characterized by its virtualization. At the same time, there still is little methodological knowledge available about the fundamental changes in this key technology. Therefore, this article examines the extent to which data collected in a field study using a virtualized RTR-Measurement tool meet established standards of data quality. Therefore, our first research question examines the validity of the RTR data in three ways. First, we consider construct validity. The results of our Kruskal-Wallis tests show a statistically significant differentiation of RTR rating behavior along party lines. This positive assessment is underlined by the high match score of a discriminant analysis. In a further analysis step, we implement a sparse structural equation model that assesses the relationship between party identification and RTR measurement, allowing us to draw conclusions about the construct validity of the virtualized RTR measurement. The calculated coefficients provide evidence that party identification and real-time rating are significantly and substantially associated. Although our analysis focuses merely on the partisan groups of the two candidates which parties are represented in the TV debates, in summarizing the results, we consider the question of construct validity (FF1.1) to be positively decided. As a second perspective, we investigate criterion validity. A central finding here emerges from an examination of the sparse structural equation model, at the core of which is the relationship of RTR ratings and retrospective verdicts on debate performance. Controlling for party identification, we can show that the coefficients are very strong and significant. This observation holds across all duels and candidates. We thus find a consistent pattern, which leads us to answer the question about criterion validity (FF1.2) of our virtualized RTR measure in the affirmative. As a third perspective, we focus on content validity. For this purpose, we refer to an established structural equation model that embeds the RTR signal in a complex framework of upstream and downstream variables of debate reception. Our results are broadly consistent across duels and candidates: real-time evaluations during the debate are significantly preformed by political predispositions (prior candidate evaluation). Consistent with our previous findings, perceived debate performance is largely a function of RTR ratings in this more complex model; this underscores the previously positive assessment about the criterion validity of the virtualized RTR measure. In turn, the retrospective candidate evaluations are significantly shaped by the real-time ratings and the retrospective verdicts on debate performance. Consequently, the framework used shows that the structure of debate perception in our field studies corresponds to findings known from studies in laboratory settings with physical input devices. We are therefore confident to answer the question of content validity (FF1.3) of our virtualized RTR measurement positively. Our second research question focuses on the reliability of the RTR data and examines it in two ways. First, using a resampling approach, we take a close look at the aggregated RTR time series. On the one hand, we find that virtualized RTR measures can indeed generate data whose aggregate RTR time series for two subsamples are clearly associated with each other in the resampling procedure. On the other hand, the findings are ambivalent because the existing correlations are only of moderate strength and in some cases only weak. Thus, the RTR measure seems to depend on the composition of the sample to a considerable extent. In a second analysis strategy, we check the individual RTR time series for internal consistency. Both Cronbach’s alpha and McDonald’s omega demonstrate a high degree of intercorrelation between the RTR ratings of the individual speech phases. When summarizing our findings on the aggregated and individual RTR time series, we must acknowledge limitations to our research question two (FF2): Virtualized RTR measurements can generate reliable data. However, this is not an automatism; rather, researchers must take special caution to ensure the conditions for an adequate study design in the online setting. Acknowledging that our results are subject to multiple limitations, we conclude that the virtualization of RTR-Measurement establishes a complementary approach to studies with a laboratory research design dominating the literature, making the analysis of viewers’ reactions to televised debates in natural reception situations accessible even in times of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Waldvogel, Thomas; Wagschal, Uwe; Metz, Thomas; Becker, Bernd; Feiten, Linus; Weishaupt, Samuel",Publizistik,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11616-021-00680-1,512
620702,Épidémiologie de l'infection virale et asthme,1998-12-31,"Paleovirology is the study of ancient viruses. The existence of a paleovirus can sometimes be detected by virtue of its accidental insertion into the germline of different animal species, which allows one to date when the virus actually existed. However, the ancient and the modern often connect, as modern viruses have unexpected origins that can be traced to ancient infections. The genomes of two species of mongooses and an egg-laying mammal called an echidna show that a virus currently present in poultry, the reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV), is actually of ancient exotic mammalian origin. REV apparently spread to poultry through a circuitous route involving the isolation of malaria parasites from a pheasant from Borneo housed at the Bronx Zoo that was contaminated with REV. Repeated passage of this virus in poultry adapted the virus to its new host. At some point, the virus got inserted into another virus, called fowlpox virus, which has spread back into the wild. Although REV may still exist somewhere in a mammalian host, its modern form links an 8 million-year-old infection of the ancestor of a mongoose to a virus that now is circulating in wild birds through malaria studies in the mid-20(th) century. These lessons of ancient and modern viruses have implications for modern human pandemics from viral reservoirs and for human interventions that may come with unintended consequences.","Etienne, Lucie; Emerman, Michael",PLoS Biol,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24013523/,512

It presents a comparative intra-country observational study design looking at events before and during the pandemic (after implementation of contagion control measures). The study design includes three districts, enabling comparison between diverse agro-ecological zones and geographical contexts. The methodology consists of primary data collection, modelling and quantitative analysis. The analysis is based on actual school meal food baskets which represent culturally and nutritionally optimised food baskets, developed by the local community and notional typical household food baskets. End May/early June 2020 is the ‘Post-COVID-19’ reference point, the same time period in 2019 i.e. June 2019 is the ‘Pre-COVID-19’ reference point. The study finds a substantial increase in food commodity prices across food groups and districts with marked inter-district variation. For school meal basket, all micronutrients show large average declines ranging from 9⋅5 % for zinc to 11 % for vitamin-A. For household food baskets on average, vitamin-A reduced 37 % followed by iron at 19 %, reduction in zinc is low due to the high zinc content in whole grain cereals. COVID-19 control measures are likely to have contributed to substantial price inflation over the reference period with potentially damaging effects on nutrition security in Nepal with serious implications for vulnerable populations.","Singh, Samrat; Nourozi, Sara; Acharya, Laxman; Thapa, Sridhar",J Nutr Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33240495/; https://doi.org/10.1017/jns.2020.43,512

Within psychiatry, a sudden relaxing of insurance and regulatory barriers during the month of March 2020 enabled clinicians practicing in a wide range of settings to quickly adopt virtual care in order to provide critical ongoing mental health supports to both existing and new patients struggling with the pandemic's impact. In this article, we briefly review the extensive literature supporting the effectiveness of telepsychiatry relative to in-person mental health care, and describe how payment and regulatory challenges were the primary barriers preventing more widespread adoption of this treatment modality prior to COVID-19. We then review key changes that were implemented at the federal, state, professional, and insurance levels over a one-month period that helped usher in an unprecedented transformation in psychiatric care delivery, from mostly in-person to mostly virtual. Early quality improvement data regarding virtual visit volumes and clinical insights from our outpatient psychiatry department located within a large, urban, tertiary care academic medical center reflect both the opportunities and challenges of virtual care for patients and providers. Finally, we provide clinical suggestions for optimizing telepsychiatry based on our experience, make a call for advocacy to continue the reduced insurance and regulatory restrictions affecting telepsychiatry even once this public health crisis has passed, and pose research questions that can help guide optimal utilization of telepsychiatry as mainstay or adjunct of outpatient psychiatric treatment now and in the future.","Chen, Justin A.; Chung, Wei-Jean; Young, Sarah K.; Tuttle, Margaret C.; Collins, Michelle B.; Darghouth, Sarah L.; Longley, Regina; Levy, Raymond; Razafsha, Mahdi; Kerner, Jeffrey C.; Wozniak, Janet; Huffman, Jeff C.",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.07.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163834320301031?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163834320301031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32750604/,512

Black/African Americans are contracting and dying from COVID-19 disproportionately. We assessed risk factors for death from COVID-19 among black inpatients at an urban center in Detroit, MI. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center cohort study. We reviewed the electronic medical records of patients positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19) on qualitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay, who were admitted between 3/8-5/6/2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The case fatality rate was 29.1% (122/419). The mean duration of symptoms prior to hospitalization was 5.3 (3.9) days. Patients who died were older (mean [SD] age, 68.7 [14.8] years vs 60.3 [16.0] years; p <0.0001), had dementia (35 [28.7%] vs 34 [11.4%]; p <0.0001), hemiplegia (14 [11.5%] vs 12 [4.0%]; p=0.004), malignancy (11 [9.0%] vs 12 [4.0%]; p=0.04), and moderate-severe liver disease (4 [3.3%] vs 1 [0.3%]; p=0.01). The incidence of AMS on presentation was higher among patients who died than those who survived, 43% vs. 20.0%, respectively (p<0.0001). From multivariable analysis, the odds of death increased with age (≥60 yrs.), admission from a nursing facility, Charlson score, altered mental status, higher C-reactive protein on admission, need for mechanical ventilation, presence of shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: These demographic, clinical and laboratory factors should help healthcare providers identify black patients at highest risk for severe COVID-19-associated outcomes. Early and aggressive interventions among this at-risk population can help mitigate adverse outcomes.","Bhargava, Ashish; Sharma, Mamta; Riederer, Kathleen; Fukushima, Elisa Akagi; Szpunar, Susanna M; Saravolatz, Louis",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32986102/,512

The procoagulant tissue factor (TF) is thought to play a role in the coagulation disorders that characterize filoviral infections. In this study, we evaluated the pathogenesis of lethal infection with the Angola strain of Marburg virus (MARV-Ang) in rhesus macaques and tested the efficacy of recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (rNAPc2), an inhibitor of TF/factor VIIa, as a potential treatment. Methods. Twelve rhesus macaques were challenged with a high dose (1000 pfu) of MARV-Ang. Six macaques were treated with rNAPc2, and 6 macaques served as control animals. Results. All 6 control animals succumbed to MARV-Ang challenge by day 8 (mean, 7.3 days), whereas 5 of 6 rNAPc2-treated animals died on day 9 and 1 rNAPc2-treated animal survived. The disease course for MARVAng infection appeared to progress more rapidly in rhesus macaques than has been previously reported for other strains of MARV. In contrast to Ebola virus (EBOV) infection in macaques, up-regulation of TF was not as striking, and deposition of fibrin was a less prominent pathologic feature of disease in these animals. Conclusions. These data show that the pathogenicity of MARV-Ang infection appears to be consistent with the apparent increased human virulence attributed to this strain. The apparent reduced efficacy of rNAPc2 against MARV-Ang infection, compared with its efficacy against EBOV infection, appears to be associated with differences in TF induction and fibrin deposition.","Geisbert, Thomas W.; Daddario-DiCaprio, Kathleen M.; Geisbert, Joan B.; Young, Howard A.; Formenty, Pierre; Fritz, Elizabeth A.; Larsen, Tom; Hensley, Lisa E.",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17940973/,512

Leçons tirées de la période COVID-19,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND: Viral gastroenteritis is the most common diarrhoeal disorder seen in general practice and emergency departments. This article aims to provide a narrative updated review on the evaluation and management of viral gastroenteritis in children. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed with Clinical Queries using the key term ‘viral gastroenteritis’. The search strategy included clinical trials, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, observational studies and reviews. The search was restricted to the English literature and the paediatric population. RESULTS: Acute viral gastroenteritis is usually self-limiting. However, it can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance if not properly treated. Adequate fluids containing physiological concentrations of glucose and electrolytes should be provided to compensate for gastrointestinal losses and cover maintenance needs. Oral rehydration therapy is as effective as intravenous (IV) fluid therapy for rehydration for children with mild-to-moderate dehydration. Measurements of serum electrolytes, creatinine and glucose are usually not necessary and should only be considered in a subset of children with severe dehydration who require hospitalization and IV therapy. Judicious use of ondansetron can increase the success rate of oral rehydration therapy and minimize the need for IV therapy and hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Acute viral gastroenteritis is associated with substantial morbidity in developed countries and significant mortality in developing countries. Physicians should educate caregivers on proper personal hygiene and handwashing to prevent faecal to oral transmission of the pathogen as well as the importance of rotavirus vaccine in the prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis. Several norovirus vaccines are currently undergoing clinical trials with promising results. It is hoped that development of an effective norovirus vaccine will further reduce the incidence of viral gastroenteritis.","Leung, Alexander KC; Hon, Kam Lun",Drugs Context,https://doi.org/10.7573/dic.2020-11-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33828604/,512

The presented work discusses the glycation process in people with advanced stage of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The concentration of different AGEs and their receptors for 58 serum samples was determined by ELISA and by spectrofluorimetric methods. In addition to fluorescent low molecular weight and protein-bound AGEs, we have also marked a new class of AGEs: melibiose-derived glycation product (MAGE). Our attention was also focused on the two groups of AGEs receptors: scavenger receptors (SR-A and SR-B) and RAGE. The correlation between the SR-AI scavenging receptors concentration and the fluorescence of AGEs as well as diabetes biological markers: GFR, creatinine contentration and HbA1c was demonstrated. A relationship between the concentration of AGEs and their receptors was also found in serum sample of patients treated with the metformin and aspirin. Furthermore, the concentration of SR-AI scavenger and the fluorescence of total AGEs was significantly lower in treated patients than in non treated patients. AGEs have also been found to contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis and diabetic complications, what could be deduced from the correlation of AGEs level and HDL cholesterol or uric acid level. Thus, it was confirmed that AGEs are involved in the pathomechanism of diabetes and other degenerative diseases. Nowadays, it is believed that AGEs due to the long time remaining in the body may be an important diagnostic marker. Their determination may allow monitoring the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of the therapy.","Indyk, Diana; Bronowicka-Szydełko, Agnieszka; Gamian, Andrzej; Kuzan, Aleksandra",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92630-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34168187/,512

However, the roles of the GI tract in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are not fully understood. We investigated how the GI tract is involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection to elucidate the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Methods Our previously established nonhuman primate (NHP) model of COVID-19 was modified in this study to test our hypothesis. Rhesus monkeys were infected with an intragastric or intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical signs were recorded after infection. Viral genomic RNA was quantified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated by examining inflammatory cytokines, macrophages, histopathology and mucin barrier integrity. Results Intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 led to infections and pathological changes not only in respiratory tissues but also in digestive tissues. Expectedly, intragastric inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in the productive infection of digestive tissues and inflammation in both the lung and digestive tissues. Inflammatory cytokines were induced by both types of inoculation with SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the increased expression of CD68. Immunohistochemistry and alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff (AB-PAS) staining showed decreased Ki67, increased cleaved caspase 3 and decreased numbers of mucin-containing goblet cells, suggesting that the inflammation induced by these two types of inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 impaired the GI barrier and caused severe infections. Conclusions Both intranasal and intragastric inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 caused pneumonia and GI dysfunction in our rhesus monkey model. Inflammatory cytokines are possible connections for the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 between the respiratory and digestive systems.","Jiao, Li; Li, Haiyan; Xu, Jingwen; Yang, Mengli; Ma, Chunxia; Li, Jingmei; Zhao, Siwen; Wang, Haixuan; Yang, Yun; Yu, Wenhai; Wang, Junbin; Yang, Jing; Long, Haiting; Gao, Jiahong; Ding, Kaiyun; Wu, Daoju; Kuang, Dexuan; Zhao, Yuan; Liu, Jiansheng; Lu, Shuaiyao; Liu, Hongqi; Peng, Xiaozhong",Gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2020.12.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001650852035527X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33307034/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001650852035527X?v=s5,512

Here, we report the results of a comprehensive screen for EVEs in crustaceans. Following up on the recent discovery of EVEs in the terrestrial isopod, Armadillidium vulgare, we scanned the genomes of six crustacean species: a terrestrial isopod (Armadillidium nasatum), two water fleas (Daphnia pulex and D. pulicaria), two copepods (the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Eurytemora affinis), and a freshwater amphipod (Hyalella azteca). RESULTS: In total, we found 210 EVEs representing 14 different lineages belonging to five different viral groups that are present in two to five species: Bunyaviridae (−ssRNA), Circoviridae (ssDNA), Mononegavirales (−ssRNA), Parvoviridae (ssDNA) and Totiviridae (dsRNA). The identification of shared orthologous insertions between A. nasatum and A. vulgare indicates that EVEs have been maintained over several millions of years, although we did not find any evidence supporting exaptation. Overall, the different degrees of EVE degradation (from none to >10 nonsense mutations) suggest that endogenization has been recurrent during the evolution of the various crustacean taxa. Our study is the first to report EVEs in D. pulicaria, E. affinis and H. azteca, many of which are likely to result from recent endogenization of currently circulating viruses. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we have unearthed a large diversity of EVEs from crustacean genomes, and shown that four of the five viral groups we uncovered (Bunyaviridae, Circoviridae, Mononegavirales, Parvoviridae) were and may still be present in three to four highly divergent crustacean taxa. In addition, the discovery of recent EVEs offers an interesting opportunity to characterize new exogenous viruses currently circulating in economically or ecologically important copepod species.

644834,Interventions aux urgences d'une équipe mobile de gériatrie et articulation avec un suivi psychologique en gériatrie aiguë lors de la première vague de Covid 19,2021-07-24,"Research Ethics Committees (RECs)—or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), as they are known in the US—were created about 50 years ago to independently assess the ethical acceptability of research projects involving human subjects, their fundamental role being the protection of the dignity and rights of research participants. In this paper we develop some critical reflections about the current situation of RECs. Our starting point is the definition of the role they should ideally play, a role that should necessarily include a collaborative approach and the focus on the ethics component of the review. This ideal is unfortunately quite far from reality: inadequacies in the functioning of RECs have been discussed for decades, along with reform proposals. Both in the US and in the European Union (EU), reforms that aim at the centralization of the review process were recently approved. Even though these reforms were needed, they nonetheless raise concerns. We focus on two such concerns, related in particular to Regulation (EU) No 536/2014: the risk of narrowing the scope of the ethics review and that of disregarding the local context. We argue that the COVID‐19 pandemic paved the way for the transition towards the centralized model and that an analysis of its impact on the research review process could provide some interesting insights into possible shortcomings of this new model. We conclude by identifying three objectives that define the role of a REC, objectives that any reform should preserve.","Tusino, Silvia; Furfaro, Maria",Br J Clin Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33891323/,512

Here we identify the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients in Shanghai. Methods: Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological features. Results: Of 198 patients, the median duration from disease onset to hospital admission was 4 days. The mean age of the patients was 50.1 years, and 51.0% patients were male. The most common symptom was fever. Less than half of the patients presented with respiratory systems including cough, sputum production, itchy or sore throat, shortness of breath, and chest congestion. 5.6% patients had diarrhoea. On admission, T lymphocytes were decreased in 45.8% patients. Ground glass opacity was the most common radiological finding on chest computed tomography. 9.6% were admitted to the ICU because of the development of organ dysfunction. Compared with patients not treated in ICU, patients treated in the ICU were older, had longer waiting time to admission, fever over 38.5o C, dyspnoea, reduced T lymphocytes, elevated neutrophils and organ failure. Conclusions: In this single centre cohort of COVID-19 patients, the most common symptom was fever, and the most common laboratory abnormality was decreased blood T cell counts. Older age, male, fever over 38.5oC, symptoms of dyspnoea, and underlying comorbidity, were the risk factors most associated with severity of disease.

One hundred and seventy calves (age 1-30 days) were divided into two groups: apparently healthy (n = 70) and diarrheic (n=100). Animals were subjected to thorough clinical, hematobiochemical and bacteriological examinations. Clinically, diarrheic calves showed various degree of diarrhea with the presence of cardinal signs of dehydration in moderate and severe cases. There was a significant increase (p<0.05) in the hemogram parameters with uremia and hyperkalemia in calves with severe diarrhea. The O-H serotyping of cultural and biochemically positive isolates identified 31 isolates belonging to 12 serotypes including O44:H18, O55:H7, O146:H21, O113:H4, O121:H7, O26:H11, O91:H21, O111:H2, O8, O127: H6, O86 and O128:H2. Molecular characterization of E. coli isolates on three toxin genes: heat-stable enterotoxin (sta), shiga toxin type 1 and 2 (stx1 and stx2) revealed two well-known pathotypes (EPEC O44:H18, O55:H7, O146:H21, O113:H4, O121:H7 and EHEC O26:H11 O91:H21 O111:H2) with high frequency of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Molecular analysis also showed a number of E. coli isolates that carry sta and stx1 or sta and stx2 gene and belonged to O8, and O127:H6, O86 and O128:H2. These isolates were identified as hybrid E. coli strains (ETEC-STEC) and found in both apparently healthy and diarrheic calves. In conclusion, the present study identified high frequency of pathogenic E. coli in both apparently healthy and diarrheic calves. Serological and molecular analysis of E. coli isolates showed that high frequency of EHEC and presence of a new phenotype, STEC–ETEC hybrid, revealing their importance in the etiopathogenesis of diarrhea in calves and reinforcing the role of these animals as a reservoir of potentially pathogenic E. coli for humans.","Aref, Nasr-Eldin M.; Abdel-Raheem, Abdel-Raheem A.; Kamaly, Hanaa F.; Hussien, Soher Z.",Open Vet J,https://doi.org/10.4314/ovj.v8i4.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30425958/,512
649717,Acute cor pulmonale in Covid-19 related ARDS: improvement with almitrine infusion.,2020-06-16,"Objectives: Globally, health care systems have been stretched to the limit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant changes have had to be made to the way in which non-COVID-19 related care has been delivered. Our objective was to understand, from the perspective of patients with a chronic, life-long condition (congenital heart disease, CHD) and their parents/carers, the impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of care, how changes were communicated and whether health care providers should do anything differently in a subsequent wave of COVID-19 infections. Design and setting: A series of asynchronous discussion forums set up and moderated by three patient charities via their Facebook pages. Participants: Patients with CHD and parents/carers of patients with CHD. Main outcome measures: Qualitative responses to questions posted on the discussion forums. Results: The forums ran over a 6-week period and involved 111 participants. Following thematic analysis of the transcripts, we identified three themes and ten subthemes related to individual condition-related factors, patient-related factors and health professional/centre factors that may have influenced how patients and parents/carers experienced changes to service delivery as a result of COVID-19. Conclusions: Our findings, whilst collected in relation to patients with CHD, are not necessarily specific to this population and we believe reflect the experiences of many thousands of people with life-long conditions in the UK. Drawing on what participants told us in the discussion forums, we have developed recommendations related to communication, service delivery and support during the pandemic that would, we think, improve patients' experience of care and, potentially, their outcomes. Although the data were collected specifically in relation to COVID-19, a number of these recommendations are relevant to the wider delivery of care to patients with chronic underlying health conditions and reflect principles of good communication and service delivery.","Wray, J.; Pagel, C.; Chester, A.

As a consequence, diverse milk compositional profiles may contribute to different postnatal outcomes, especially in infants facing adverse perinatal environments. We investigated whether variability in milk concentrations of key metabolic hormones is associated with different growth outcomes in infants born preterm, a perinatal complication known to impact on infant growth. Methods: Human milk samples were collected from 169 mothers of 191 infants enrolled in the DIAMOND trial, a randomized trial of nutrition for moderate-late preterm infants, at 5 and 10 days postpartum and again at 4 months' corrected age and analyzed for leptin, adiponectin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1. Infant weight and body composition were measured at birth, discharge and 4 months' corrected age. Multiple linear regression models were used to examine correlations between milk hormone concentrations, weight z-scores and body composition at discharge and 4 months' corrected age, and weight gain from birth to 4 months' corrected age. Sex-specific interactions were examined. Results: Higher milk IGF-1 concentrations on day 5 after birth were associated with greater infant fat-free mass at 4 months' corrected age. Milk IGF-1 concentrations at 4 months were positively associated with fat mass and fat-free mass at 4 months in boys but not girls. Milk leptin concentrations on day 5 after birth were positively associated with fat mass at discharge from hospital, but negatively associated with fat mass at 4 months' corrected age. No significant association was found for milk adiponectin concentrations. Conclusion: Milk IGF-1 and leptin concentrations in mothers of moderate-late preterm babies are associated with different growth and body composition through to 4 months' corrected age and these associations are often different in boys and girls. The sex-specific effects of nutrient and hormone exposure during early life in preterm infants warrants further investigation to optimize the nutritional care these infants receive, particularly in hospital, where the same nutrition is provided to boys and girls.","Galante, Laura; Reynolds, Clare M.; Milan, Amber M.; Alexander, Tanith; Bloomfield, Frank H.; Jiang, Yannan; Asadi, Sharin; Muelbert, Mariana; Cameron-Smith, David; Pundir, Shikha; Vickers, Mark H.",Front Nutr,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2021.641227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34124118/,512

656395,CAMBIOS A PARTIR DE LA COVID-19. UNA PERSPECTIVA DESDE LA PEDIATRÍA INTERNA HOSPITALARIA,2020-06-19,"BACKGROUND: With the development of more rapid and sensitive detection methods based on PCR techniques, the contributions of respiratory viral infections to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adult patients are being more and more recognized. Yet, up to now, there has been a lack of synthetic data that clearly demonstrates the incidence of respiratory viral infections in adult patients with CAP. OBJECTIVES: We intended to demonstrate the incidence of respiratory viral infections detected by PCR and real-time PCR in adult patients with CAP. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for studies providing the incidence of respiratory viral infections in adult patients with CAP. We investigated potential sources of heterogeneity by a univariant metaregression analysis and calculated the combined incidence of viral infections, viral infections mixed with other pathogens and individual respiratory virus species. RESULTS: We eventually identified 23 eligible reports with a total number of 6,404 patients. Incidences ranged from 8.6 to 56.2% for overall respiratory viral infections. We noted significant heterogeneity in incidence estimates for the incidence of viral infections (Cochran's χ(2) = 269.9, p < 0.0001, I(2) = 91.8%). The combined incidence of viral infections was 22.4% (95% CI = 19.0-25.7). Incidences of viral coinfections with other pathogens ranged from 3 to 28%. A high level of heterogeneity was identified as well during the estimates for incidences of coinfections (χ(2) = 200.9, p < 0.0001, I(2) = 91.5%). The combined incidence of viral coinfections with other pathogens was 12.4% (95% CI = 9.7-15.0). Our heterogeneity analyses suggested that a lower respiratory tract sample was associated with higher overall viral incidence. Moreover, the influenza virus, rhinovirus and coronavirus were the 3 most frequently detected viral pathogens in adult patients with CAP according to our study. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses are probably crucial pathogens of adult patients with CAP, with the influenza virus being the most frequent viral pathogen identified. More than half of the viral infections are characterized as mixed infections with other pathogens.","Wu, Xiaodong; Wang, Qin; Wang, Min; Su, Xin; Xing, Zheng; Zhang, Weiyun; Shi, Yi",Respiration,https://doi.org/10.1159/000369561; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25791384/,512

Both of these viruses can cause severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The clinical differences and mortality associated with these two pandemic pneumonias in patients with ARDS are not well established Objective: To compare case-fatality between ARDS-Covid-19 and ARDS-Influenza A (H1N1), adjusting for known prognostic risk factors. Design, Setting and Participants: One hundred forty-seven patients with COVID-19 were compared with 94 with Influenza A-H1N1, all of these were admitted to the intensive care unit of the Referral Center for Respiratory Diseases and COVID-19 in Mexico City and fulfilled the criteria of ARDS. Results: Patients arrived at the hospital after 9 days of symptoms. Influenza patients had more obesity, more use of Norepinephrine, and higher levels of lactic dehydrogenase and glucose, and fewer platelets and lower PaO2/FIO2. Crude mortality was higher in COVID than in influenza (39% vs. 22%; p = 0.005). In a Cox proportional hazard model, patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 had a hazard ratio (HR) = 3.7; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.9-7.4, adjusted for age, gender, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, ventilatory ratio, and prone ventilation. In the fully adjusted model, the ventilatory ratio and the absence of prone-position ventilation were also predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) had a 3.7 times higher risk of death than similar patients with Influenza A-H1N1, after adjusting for SOFA score and other relevant risk factors for mortality.","HERNANDEZ CARDENAS, C.

Actualización en vacunas, 2020()",2020-12-30,"This study represents the first empirical estimation of threshold values between nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) concentrations and COVID-19-related deaths in France. The concentration of NO(2) linked to COVID-19-related deaths in three major French cities were determined using Artificial Neural Networks experiments and a Causal Direction from Dependency (D2C) algorithm. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential effects of NO(2) in spreading the epidemic. The underlying hypothesis is that NO(2), as a precursor to secondary particulate matter formation, can foster COVID-19 and make the respiratory system more susceptible to this infection. Three different neural networks for the cities of Paris, Lyon and Marseille were built in this work, followed by the application of an innovative tool of cutting the signal from the inputs to the selected target. The results show that the threshold levels of NO(2) connected to COVID-19 range between 15.8 μg/m(3) for Lyon, 21.8 μg/m(3) for Marseille and 22.9 μg/m(3) for Paris, which were significantly lower than the average annual concentration limit of 40 μg/m³ imposed by Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament.","Mele, Marco; Magazzino, Cosimo; Schneider, Nicolas; Strezov, Vladimir",Environ Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33417906/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120315607?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120315607; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110663,512

COVID-19 is also a new infectious disease. The symptoms of this disease, which include fever, shortness of breath, and cough, can be mild to severe and can even lead to death. Due to the use of immunosuppressive drugs by Patients with MS, they might be at greater risk of catching COVID-19. Thus, patients with MS may be more afraid of catching the virus. One of the important factors is the relationship between cognitive deficit and the increase in patients' fear of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between fear of catching COVID-19 and cognitive impairment in patients with MS. Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the MS Clinic, Sina hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Our participants in this project were Patients with MS who were over 18 years old and had no history of other neurological and psychiatric diseases. In addition to obtaining demographic and clinical information, we measured the fear of catching the COVID 2019 via Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), which is 7-item questionnaire. We also used Multiple Sclerosis Neuro Psychological Screening Questionnaire (MSNQ) to assess memory and information processing speed in Patients with MS. Results: After adjustment for age, gender, disease duration, highest level of education, MS type, and EDSS in linear regression model, as well as the MSNQ total score and fear score of catching coronavirus, the results demonstrated a significant positive correlation with P value of 0.00 and β: 0.024.

While children are generally thought to be at less risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults, comprehensive population-based evidence for the risk in children with cancer is unavailable. We aimed to produce evidence of the incidence and outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 in children with cancer attending all hospitals treating this population across the UK. METHODS: Retrospective and prospective observational study of all children in the UK under 16 diagnosed with cancer through data collection from all hospitals providing cancer care to this population. Eligible patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The primary end-point was death, discharge or end of active care for COVID-19 for those remaining in hospital. RESULTS: Between 12 March 2020 and 31 July 2020, 54 cases were identified: 15 (28%) were asymptomatic, 34 (63%) had mild infections and 5 (10%) moderate, severe or critical infections. No patients died and only three patients required intensive care support due to COVID-19. Estimated incidence of hospital identified SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with cancer under 16 was 3%. CONCLUSIONS: Children with cancer with SARS-CoV-2 infection do not appear at increased risk of severe infection compared to the general paediatric population. This is reassuring and supports the continued delivery of standard treatment.","Millen, Gerard C.; Arnold, Roland; Cazier, Jean-Baptiste; Curley, Helen; Feltbower, Richard G.; Gamble, Ashley; Glaser, Adam W.; Grundy, Richard G.; Lee, Lennard Y.

To evaluate the effect of mRNA SARS-Cov-2 vaccination on the incidence of new SARS-CoV-2 infections in health care workers (HCW). Methods. The evolution of the incident rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of 2590 HCW after a mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, as compared to the rate in the community (n=170513). SARS-CoV-2 infections were microbiologically confirmed by an antigen, a CRP positive test, or both. Results. A total of 1820 HCW (70,3% of total) received the first dose of the vaccine between January 10-16, 2021), and 296 (11,4%) the following week. All of them completed vaccination 3 weeks later. New SARS-COV-2 infections in HCW declined by 62% at 2-4 weeks after the first dose of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and virtually disappeared after the second dose of the vaccine. Vaccination rate was negligible for this time period in the community (<5%). The decline in the incident rate of SARS-COoV-2 new infection in HCW shortly after the administration of the first dose of the vaccine was strikingly higher than the reduction observed in the general population (p<0.001and became even more pronounced after the second dose of the vaccine (p<0.001). Conclusions. mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is associated with a dramatic decline in new SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCW, even before the administration of the second dose of the vaccine.","Guijarro, C.; Galan, I.

The huge issue is the high infectivity and the absence of vaccine and customised drugs allowing for hard management of this outbreak, thus a rapid and on site analysis is a need to contain the spread of COVID-19. Herein, we developed an electrochemical immunoassay for rapid and smart detection of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in saliva. The electrochemical assay was conceived for Spike (S) protein or Nucleocapsid (N) protein detection using magnetic beads as support of immunological chain and secondary antibody with alkaline phosphatase as immunological label. The enzymatic by-product 1-naphtol was detected using screen-printed electrodes modified with carbon black nanomaterial. The analytical features of the electrochemical immunoassay were evaluated using the standard solution of S and N protein in buffer solution and untreated saliva with a detection limit equal to 19 ng/mL and 8 ng/mL in untreated saliva, respectively for S and N protein. Its effectiveness was assessed using cultured virus in biosafety level 3 and in saliva clinical samples comparing the data using the nasopharyngeal swab specimens tested with Real-Time PCR. The agreement of the data, the low detection limit achieved, the rapid analysis (30 min), the miniaturization, and portability of the instrument combined with the easiness to use and no-invasive sampling, confer to this analytical tool high potentiality for market entry as the first highly sensitive electrochemical immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 detection in untreated saliva.","Fabiani, Laura; Saroglia, Marco; Galatà, Giuseppe; De Santis, Riccardo; Fillo, Silvia; Luca, Vincenzo; Faggioni, Giovanni; D'Amore, Nino; Regalbuto, Elisa; Salvatori, Piero; Terova, Genciana; Moscone, Danila; Lista, Florigio; Arduini, Fabiana",Biosens Bioelectron,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566320306758; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566320306758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33086175/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.112686,512

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and S1 subunit involved in receptor engagement, is a potential therapeutic target. We describe the development of a phage-displayed single-domain antibody library by grafting naive complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) into framework regions of a human germline immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) allele. Panning this library against SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 subunit identified fully human single-domain antibodies targeting five distinct epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 RBD with subnanomolar to low nanomolar affinities. Some of these antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by targeting a cryptic epitope located in the spike trimeric interface.

The role of inflammation in myocardial injury remains unclear. We sought to determine the association of elevated troponin with mortality in a large, ethnically diverse population of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and to determine the association of elevated inflammatory markers with increased troponin levels. We reviewed all patients admitted at our health system with COVID-19 from March 1 to April 27, 2020, who had a troponin assessment within 48 hours of admission. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for mortality during hospitalization, controlling for demographics, co-morbidities, and markers of inflammation. Of 11,159 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 6,247 had a troponin assessment within 48 hours. Of these, 4,426 (71%) patients had normal, 919 (15%) had mildly elevated, and 902 (14%) had severely elevated troponin. Acute phase and inflammatory markers were significantly elevated in patients with mildly and severely elevated troponin compared with normal troponin. Patients with elevated troponin had significantly increased odds of death for mildly elevated compared with normal troponin (adjusted OR, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.68 to 2.53; p < 0.001) and for severely elevated compared with normal troponin (OR, 4.51; 95% confidence interval, 3.66 to 5.54; p < 0.001) independently of elevation in inflammatory markers. In conclusion, patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and elevated troponin had markedly increased mortality compared with patients with normal troponin levels.

Severe COVID-19 patients have elevated blood levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, CXCL8 and interferon (IFN)γ. Objective To investigate the effect of antiviral treatment serum cytokines in severe COVID-19 patients. Methods Blood was obtained from 29 patients (aged 32-79yr) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 upon admission and 7 days after antiviral (Favipiravir or Lopinavir/Ritonavir) treatment. Patients also received standard supportive treatment in this retrospective observational study. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were evaluated to investigate lung manifestations of COVID-19. Serum was also obtained and cytokines levels were evaluated. 19 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were studied. Results Anti-viral therapy significantly reduced CT scan scores and the elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In contrast, sserum levels of IL-6, CXCL8 and IFNγ were elevated at baseline in COVID-19 subjects compared to healthy subjects with IL-6 (p=0.002) and CXCL8 (p=0.023) levels being further elevated after antiviral therapy. IL-1β (p=0.002) and TNFα (p=0.023) levels were also enhanced after treatment but baseline levels were similar to those of healthy controls. These changes occurred irrespective of whether patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. Conclusion Antiviral treatments did not suppress the inflammatory phase of COVID-19 after 7 days treatment although CT, CRP and LDH suggest a decline in lung inflammation. There was limited evidence for a viral-mediated cytokine storm in these COVID-19 subjects.","Mortaz, Esmaeil; Bassir, Ali; Dalil Roofchayee, Neda; Dezfuli, Neda K.; Jamaati, Hamidreza; Tabarsi, Payam; Moniri, Afshin; Rezaei, Mitra; Mehryan, Payam; Varahram, Mohammad; Marjani, Majid; Mumby, Sharon; Adcock, Ian M.",Int Immunopharmacol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576921000436; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33631512/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107407; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576921000436?v=s5,512

METHOD: A 55-year-old African American male with a history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obesity, tobacco use, and hypertension voluntarily presented to the local hospital with auditoryhallucinations and delusions. During an inpatient stay, the patient developed symptomsconsistent with COVID-19 and subsequently tested positive for the virus. Thirty-nine days after the initial positive COVID-19 test result, he remained in a coma with retained brainstem responses. An EEG demonstrated encephalopathy and MRI showed multiple, well-circumscribed white matter lesions consistent with acute demyelination (Figure 1). After three days of high-dose steroids and over a month in a coma, the patient began following simple commands. Unfortunately, on hospital day 66, the patient developed sudden hypotension and worsening respiratory status. RESULTS: While psychotic episodes in relation to COVID-19 are not widely reported, psychotic episodes are shown in three COVID-19 cases. Other reports have found significant changes in consciousness in COVID-19 patients with delayed awakening from a comatose state. Pre-existing inflammatory responses in those with psychiatric disease may be accelerated by the immune response due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Mental status changes in those with psychiatric illness who have COVID-19 are worth exploring. It is unclear whether a history of COVID-19 may accelerate a neuropsychiatric process or other central nervous system diseases. Future research may want to examine the possible interrelationship between pre-existing neurological vulnerabilities and COVID-19. The possibility of high-dose steroid treatment for COVID-19 neuroinflammatory complications should be considered.

667674,La simulación como herramienta para facilitar la adaptación de la organización sanitaria a la pandemia de COVID-19,2020-09-11,"Inpatient electrolyte testing rates vary significantly across pediatric hospitals. Despite evidence that unnecessary testing exists, providers still struggle with reducing electrolyte laboratory testing. We aimed to reduce serum electrolyte testing among pediatric inpatients by 20% across 5 sites within 6 months. METHODS: A national quality improvement collaborative evaluated standardized interventions for reducing inpatient serum electrolyte testing at 5 large tertiary and quaternary children’s hospitals. The outcome measure was the rate of electrolyte laboratory tests per 10 patient-days. The interventions were adapted from a previous single-site improvement project and included cost card reminders, automated laboratory plans via electronic medical record, structured rounds discussions, and continued education. The collaborative utilized weekly conference calls to discuss Plan, Do, Study, Act cycles, and barriers to implementation efforts. RESULTS: The study included 17,149 patient-days across 5 hospitals. The baseline preintervention electrolyte laboratory testing rate mean was 4.82 laboratory tests per 10 patient-days. Postimplementation, special cause variation in testing rates shifted the mean to 4.19 laboratory tests per 10 patient-days, a 13% reduction. There was a wide variation in preintervention electrolyte testing rates and the effectiveness of interventions between the hospitals participating in the collaborative. CONCLUSIONS: This multisite improvement collaborative was able to rapidly disseminate and implement value improvement interventions leading to a reduction in electrolyte testing; however, we did not meet our goal of 20% testing reduction across all sites. Quality improvement collaboratives must consider variation in context when adapting previously successful single-center interventions to a wide variety of sites.","Coe, Megan; Gruhler, Heidi; Schefft, Matthew; Williford, Dustin; Burger, Barrett; Crain, Emily; Mihalek, Alexandra J.; Santos, Maria; Cotter, Jillian M.; Trowbridge, Gregory; Kessenich, Jeri; Nolan, Mark; Tchou, Michael J.",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134756/; https://doi.org/10.1097/pq9.0000000000000351,512
667837,Sex differences in severity and mortality from COVID-19: are males more vulnerable?,2020-09-18,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an emergent infectious disease that has spread geographically to become a global pandemic. While much research focuses on the epidemiological and virological aspects of COVID-19 transmission, there remains an important gap in knowledge regarding the drivers of geographical diffusion between places, in particular at the global scale. Here, we use quantile regression to model the roles of globalisation, human settlement and population characteristics as socio-spatial determinants of reported COVID-19 diffusion over a six-week period in March and April 2020. Our exploratory analysis is based on reported COVID-19 data published by Johns Hopkins University which, despite its limitations, serves as the best repository of reported COVID-19 cases across nations. RESULTS: The quantile regression model suggests that globalisation, settlement, and population characteristics related to high human mobility and interaction predict reported disease diffusion. Human development level (HDI) and total population predict COVID-19 diffusion in countries with a high number of total reported cases (per million) whereas larger household size, older populations, and globalisation tied to human interaction predict COVID-19 diffusion in countries with a low number of total reported cases (per million). Population density, and population characteristics such as total population, older populations, and household size are strong predictors in early weeks but have a muted impact over time on reported COVID-19 diffusion. In contrast, the impacts of interpersonal and trade globalisation are enhanced over time, indicating that human mobility may best explain sustained disease diffusion. CONCLUSIONS: Model results confirm that globalisation, settlement and population characteristics, and variables tied to high human mobility lead to greater reported disease diffusion. These outcomes serve to inform suppression strategies, particularly as they are related to anticipated relocation diffusion from more- to less-developed countries and regions, and hierarchical diffusion from countries with higher population and density. It is likely that many of these processes are replicated at smaller geographical scales both within countries and within regions. Epidemiological strategies must therefore be tailored according to human mobility patterns, as well as countries’ settlement and population characteristics. We suggest that limiting human mobility to the greatest extent practical will best restrain COVID-19 diffusion, which in the absence of widespread vaccination may be one of the best lines of epidemiological defense.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in five hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System during March 1, 2020 to July 29, 2020. All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. We identified sarcoidosis patients who met diagnostic criteria for sarcoidosis according to accepted guidelines. An adverse disease outcome was defined as the presence of intubation and mechanical ventilation or in-hospital mortality. In sarcoidosis patients, we reported (when available) the results of pulmonary function testing measured within 3 years prior to the time of SARS‑CoV‑2 infection. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to generate an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) to evaluate sarcoidosis as a risk factor for an adverse outcome. The same model was used to analyze sarcoidosis patients with moderate and/or severe impairment in pulmonary function. RESULTS: The study included 7337 patients, 37 of whom (0.5%) had sarcoidosis. The crude rate of developing an adverse outcome was significantly higher in patients with moderately and/or severely impaired pulmonary function (9/14 vs. 3/23, p = 0.003). While the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was not independently associated with risk of an adverse event, (aOR 1.8, 95% CI 0.9–3.6), the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in patients with moderately and/or severely impaired pulmonary function was associated with an adverse outcome (aOR 7.8, 95% CI 2.4–25.8). CONCLUSION: Moderate or severe impairment in pulmonary function is associated with mortality in sarcoidosis patients infected with SARS‑CoV‑2.

It is generally believed that this reflects the age-associated decline in the number, repertoire and function of available naive T cells. Here, we propose that naive T cells become increasingly irrelevant to the immune system, and that responses to newly encountered antigens are progressively dominated by cross-reactive memory T cells as the individual ages. In addition, we propose that the majority, if not all, of the response to newly encountered antigens in the elderly is mediated by cross-reactive memory T cells. This predicts highly stochastic responses to new infections that should vary between individuals, and has important implications for vaccination strategies in the elderly.","Woodland, David L.; Blackman, Marcia A.",Trends Immunol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147149060600144X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S147149060600144X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16731040/,512

Therefore, the rapid and practicable detection of P. cactorum is important for disease monitoring and forecasting. In this study, we developed a lateral flow recombinase polymerase amplification (LF-RPA) assay for the sensitive visual detection of P. cactorum. Specific primers for P. cactorum were designed based on the ras-related protein gene Ypt1; all 10 P. cactorum isolates yielded positive detection results, whereas no cross-reaction occurred in related oomycete or fungal species. The detection limit for the LF-RPA assay was 100 fg of genomic DNA under optimized conditions. Combined with a simplified alkaline lysis method for plant DNA extraction, the LF-RPA assay successfully detected P. cactorum in naturally diseased strawberry samples without specialized equipment within 40 min. Thus, the LF-RPA assay developed in this study is a rapid, simple, and accurate method for the detection of P. cactorum, with the potential for further application in resource-limited laboratories.

This is happening due to multiple factors: strong policy push by different government that includes dedicated investment, speeding up regulation process, multiple agencies involvement, and multilateral bodies led by WHO trying to create a global platform, huge grants from private funding bodies, strategic linkages across the whole research and innovation value chain between firms, academic, research organisations and start-ups. The paper maps the research papers and ongoing clinical trials to provide an informed view of the current status of the research and drug development activity as seen through the lens of research papers and clinical trials. The intended goal of this study is to help the research community and policy makers to keep track of highly relevant research and drug development in COVID-19.","Aggarwal, R.; Bhattacharya, S.; Singh, S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.27.20141788; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.27.20141788v1?rss=1,512

685413,Nouveaux concepts de consultations médicales en oncologie,2020-08-01,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic deeply threatens the rigorous conduct of clinical trials, notably by delaying site initiation visits, patient enrolment, treatment administration, trial-associated procedures, and data monitoring. Unlike most other medical specialties, clinical trials are an integral part of patient care in oncology. Limiting access to clinical trials therefore results in a loss of chance for patients. Methods: In this retrospective single-center study, we collected clinical trial-specific items (including patient-related or trial management-related items) during the first pandemic wave (March– June 2020) and lockdown (March 17th-May 11th) at Gustave Roussy, and compared them to those of the same period in 2019. Results: In March 2020, 84 phase I (P1) and 210 phase II/III (P2/3) trials were open. During the first pandemic wave, 21 (25%) P1 and 20 (9%) P2/3 trials were temporarily halted, following a unilateral sponsor decision in virtually all cases;all but one were industry-sponsored. Despite this, all important metrics of the P1/2 trial activity remained similar to those of 2019, including the number of patients referred for inclusion (599 vs 620), inclusion consultations (215 vs 247), patients starting treatment (130 vs 130), Internal Review Board (IRB) submissions (14 vs 16), and site initiation visits (11 vs 15), all in 2020 vs 2019, respectively. The impact of the first lock-down was more marked on P2/3, with 152 patient inclusions (vs 346 in 2019), 125 randomizations (vs 278), 43 IRB submissions (vs 50) and 34 site initiation visits (vs 40). However, in parallel, 475 patients were included in three “COVID and cancer” trials. Among the 443 P1 and 2851 P2/3 patients, 198 and 628 COVID-19 PCR were performed internally, and five and 15 (2.5%) were positive, respectively. One patient with a community-based COVID-19 died after transfer in intensive care. Conclusions: Cancer clinical trials can, and must be maintained despite challenges brought by COVID-19. Sharing experiences and retrospectively evaluating the impact on patients’ safety and cancer-related outcomes will be critical to durably improve the clinical trials conduct and to anticipate at best challenges brought by future similar crises.

Methods We retrospectively investigated the number and condition of patients who were admitted to the ED with AP symptoms from 1 March to 31 May 2019 and 2020. Patients’ data was assembled from the Emergency Department of University Hospital in Wroclaw, Poland. Generic data included the following characteristics: sex, age, AP as the main complaint, and medical triage tag color. The specific data included complete blood count parameters. Results There was a decrease in the number of admitted patients to the ED from March to May 2019 in comparison to the same period in 2020. Patients reported themselves to the ED less frequently or later than usually, however, they did not present with worse blood parameters than in the previous year. Conclusion The COVID-19 outbreak shows that solutions must be found to form higher sanitary and infection-control standards and improve the functioning of the ED during a pandemic.","Tokarczyk, Urszula; Śliwa, Anna; Nowak, Łukasz; Sutkowska, Karolina; Kaliszewski, Krzysztof",Asian J Surg,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1015958421003353; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asjsur.2021.06.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34148754/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1015958421003353?v=s5,512
686366,Recomendaciones en el manejo de la pandemia por coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) en pacientes con trasplante renal,2020-04-03,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite advances in hypertension prevention and treatment, the proportion of patients who are aware, treated and controlled is low, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We will evaluate an adapted version of a multilevel and multicomponent hypertension control program in Guatemala, previously proven effective and feasible in Argentina. The program components are: protocol-based hypertension treatment using a standardized algorithm; team-based collaborative care; health provider education; health coaching sessions; home blood pressure monitoring; blood pressure audit; and feedback. METHODS: Using a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation design, we will evaluate clinical and implementation outcomes of the multicomponent program in Guatemala over an 18-month period. Through a cluster randomized trial, we will randomly assign 18 health districts to the intervention arm and 18 to enhanced usual care across five departments, enrolling 44 participants per health district and 1584 participants in total. The clinical outcomes are (1) the difference in the proportion of patients with controlled hypertension (< 130/80 mmHg) between the intervention and control groups at 18 months and (2) the net change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure from baseline to 18 months. The context-enhanced Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM)/Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) framework will guide the evaluation of the implementation at the level of the patient, provider, and health system. Using a mixed-methods approach, we will evaluate the following implementation outcomes: acceptability, adoption, feasibility, fidelity, adaptation, reach, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. DISCUSSION: We will disseminate the study findings, and promote scale up and scale out of the program, if proven effective. This study will generate urgently needed data on effective, adoptable, and sustainable interventions and implementation strategies to improve hypertension control in Guatemala and other LMICs.

687702,Le remdésivir chez les patients atteints de la COVID-19,2021-04-06,"An alliance of established experts on critical care, Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), has published two protocols for treatment of COVID-19. The first one, methylprednisolone, ascorbic acid, thiamine, and heparin (MATH+), is intended for hospital and intensive care unit treatment of pulmonary phases of the disease. It is based on affordable, commonly available components: anti-inflammatory corticosteroids (methylprednisolone, ""M""), high-dose vitamin C infusion (ascorbic acid, ""A""), vitamin B1 (thiamine, ""T""), anticoagulant heparin (""H""), antiparasitic agent ivermectin, and supplemental components (""+"") including melatonin, vitamin D, elemental zinc, and magnesium. The MATH+ protocol has received scarce attention due to the World Health Organization (WHO) advising against the use of corticosteroids in the beginning of the pandemic. In addition, randomized controlled clinical trials were required as a condition for adoption of the protocol. As the hospital mortality rate of MATH+ treated patients was approximately a quarter of the rate of patients receiving a standard of care, the authors of the protocol considered performing such trials unethical. Other parties have later performed clinical trials with corticosteroids and anticoagulants, which has led to a more widespread adoption of these components. In October 2020, ivermectin was upgraded from an optional component to an essential component of the protocol. According to the authors, ivermectin is considered the first agent effective for both prophylaxis (prevention) of COVID-19 and for treatment of all phases of COVID-19 including outpatient treatment of the early symptomatic phase. Therefore, at the end of October 2020, a separate ivermectin-based I-MASK+ protocol for prophylaxis and early outpatient treatment of COVID-19 was published.","Turkia, Mika",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.12403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33532161/,512

This study estimates the economic burden of COVID-19 in 31 provincial-level administrative regions in China between January and March 2020. Methods The healthcare and societal cost of COVID-19 was estimated using bottom-up approach. The main cost components included identification, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, compulsory quarantine and productivity losses for all affected residents in China during the study period. Input data were obtained from government reports, clinical guidelines, and other published literature. The primary outcomes were total health and societal costs. Costs were reported in both RMB and USD (2019 value). Outcomes The total estimated healthcare and societal cost associated with the outbreak is 4.26 billion RMB (0.62 billion USD) and 2,647 billion RMB (383 billion USD), respectively. The main components of routine healthcare costs are inpatient care (41.0%) and medicines (30.9%). The main component of societal costs is productivity losses (99.8%). Hubei province incurred the highest healthcare cost (83.2%) whilst Guangdong province incurred the highest societal cost (14.6%). Interpretation This review highlights a large economic burden of the recent COVID-19 outbreak in China.

Now more than ever, action is needed to tackle vaccine hesitancy, especially in light of the availability of effective and safe vaccines. A cross-sectional online survey was carried out on a representative random sample of 1011 citizens from the Emilia-Romagna region, in Italy, in January 2021. The questionnaire collected information on socio-demographics, comorbidities, past vaccination refusal, COVID-19-related experiences, risk perception of infection, and likelihood to accept COVID-19 vaccination. Multiple logistic regression analyses and classification tree analyses were performed to identify significant predictors of vaccine hesitancy and to distinguish groups with different levels of hesitancy. Overall, 31.1% of the sample reported hesitancy. Past vaccination refusal was the key discriminating variable followed by perceived risk of infection. Other significant predictors of hesitancy were: ages between 35 and 54 years, female gender, low educational level, low income, and absence of comorbidities. The most common concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine involved safety (54%) and efficacy (27%). Studying the main determinants of vaccine hesitancy can help with targeting vaccination strategies, in order to gain widespread acceptance—a key path to ensure a rapid way out of the current pandemic emergency.","Reno, Chiara; Maietti, Elisa; Fantini, Maria Pia; Savoia, Elena; Manzoli, Lamberto; Montalti, Marco; Gori, Davide",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9040378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33924534/,512

To date, there is no specific antiviral drug available to combat this virus, except the vaccine. In this study, the main protease (Mpro) required for SARS-CoV-2 viral replication was expressed and purified. Thirty-six compounds were tested as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technique. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of Ebselen and Ebsulfur analogs were obtained to be in the range of 0.074-0.91 μM. Notably, the molecules containing furane substituent displayed higher inhibition against Mpro, followed by Ebselen 1i (IC50 = 0.074 μM) and Ebsulfur 2k (IC50 = 0.11 μM). The action mechanism of 1i and 2k were characterized by enzyme kinetics, pre-incubation and jump dilution assays, as well as fluorescent labeling experiments, which suggested that both compounds covalently and irreversibly bind to Mpro, while molecular docking suggested that 2k formed an S–S bond with the Cys145 at the enzymatic active site. This study provides two very potent scaffolds Ebsulfur and Ebselen for the development of covalent inhibitors of Mpro to combat COVID-19.","Sun, Le-Yun; Chen, Cheng; Su, Jianpeng; Li, Jia-Qi; Jiang, Zhihui; Gao, Han; Chigan, Jia-Zhu; Ding, Huan-Huan; Zhai, Le; Yang, Ke-Wu",Bioorg Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33915460/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bioorg.2021.104889; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0045206821002662; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045206821002662?v=s5,512
690591,Manifestaciones extratorácicas de la COVID-19 en adultos y presentación de la enfermedad en niños,2021-04-27,"The COVID-19 is an established threat whose clinical features and epidemiology continues to evolve. In an effort to contain the disease, the National Health Service has adopted a digital first approach in UK general practice resulting in a significant shift away from face-to-face consultations. Consequently, more consultations are being completed without obtaining objective recording of vital signs and face-to-face examination. Some regions have formed hot hubs to facilitate the review of suspected COVID-19 cases and keep their practice site ‘clean’ including the use of doorstep observations in avoiding the risk of face-to-face examination. To support the safe, effective and efficient remote assessment of suspected and confirmed patients with COVID-19, we established a doorstep assessment service to compliment telephone and video consultations. This allows physiological parameters such as temperature, pulse, blood pressure and oxygen saturation to be obtained to guide further triage. Quality improvement methods were used to integrate and optimise the doorstep assessment and measure the improvements made. The introduction of a doorstep assessment service increased the proportion of assessments for patients with suspected COVID-19 in routine care over weeks. At the same time we were able to dramatically reduce face-to-face assessment over a 6-week period by optimising through a range of measures including the introduction of a digital stethoscope. The majority of patients were managed by their own general practitioner following assessment supporting continuity of care. There were no adverse events during the period of observation; no staff absences related to COVID-19. Quality improvement methods have facilitated the successful integration of doorstep assessments into clinical care.","Irving, Greg; Lawson, David; Tinsley, Adele; Parr, Helen; Whittaker, Cheryl; Jones, Hayley; Cox, Stephen",BMJ Open Qual,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2020-001081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781992/,512
