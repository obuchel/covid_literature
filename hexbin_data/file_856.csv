69410,Pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome.,2021-04-16,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is recognised globally as one of the greatest threats to human and animal health; thus, discovery of alternative antibacterial agents to address AMR is a priority challenge. This study constitutes the first report of a low-melting temperature, polymer- extrusion process for the smart delivery of thermally-sensitive antimicrobial bioactives, including generally-regarded-as-safe (GRAS) bioactives derived from various sources. Bioactives were assessed before and after extrusion by determining their respective minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). WHO-priority AMR-bacterial isolates causing zoonotic infections were evaluated along with use of standard ATCC strains. Findings revealed that this copolymer method was capable of delivering thermally-sensitive bioactives with varying degrees of growth inhibition against the AMR-bacterial strains. The extrusion process was found to increase the effect of nisin against MRSA (4-fold increase) and L. monocytogenes (6.4-fold increase), silver nitrate (AgNO3) against E. coli (3.6-fold increase) and S. epidermidis (1.25-fold increase), and chitosan against S. aureus (1.25-fold). Findings show the potential applicability of this polymer extrusion process for developing future bioactive-loaded polymer compounds; thus, highlighting the potential of converging bio-based industry with novel materials for enabling 'One-Health' solutions.","Masterson, Kevin; Meade, Elaine; Garvey, Mary; Lynch, Mark; Major, Ian; Rowan, Neil J",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149545; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399333/,856
76347,"Management of COVID-19: the risks associated with treatment are clear, but the benefits remain uncertain.",2020-05-05,"BACKGROUND To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of artificial ascites to assist thermal ablation of liver cancer adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract in patients with previous abdominal surgery. METHODS Thirty-nine patients with a total of 40 liver malignant tumors were enrolled between January 2016 and June 2019. All had histories of hepatectomy, splenectomy, cholecystectomy, and intestinal surgery. The distance between the tumor and the gastrointestinal tract was < 5 mm. Normal saline was used as artificial ascites to protect the gastrointestinal tract during thermal ablation. The success rate of the procedure, incidence of major complications, and the technical efficacy of ablation were recorded. Patients were followed for local tumor progression (LTP), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS The use of artificial ascites was successful in 38 of the 40 procedures (95%). Major complications occurred in two of the 39 patients (5.1%) following the procedure. One was an intestinal fistula that occurred in a failed case and was associated with an infection. The other was a liver abscess that occurred in a successful case. The technical efficacy of ablation was 100% (40/40 procedures). The median follow-up was 16 months. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year LTP rates were 2.9, 5.7 and 5.7%. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 97.1, 86.8 and 69.5%. CONCLUSION In patients with previous abdominal surgery, artificial ascites is feasible and effective for assisting thermal ablation of liver cancer adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract.","Huang, Qiannan; Li, Jianguo; Zeng, Qingjing; Tan, Lei; Zheng, Rongqin; He, Xuqi; Li, Kai",BMC cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-020-07261-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32795279/,856
79112,COVID-19 in intensive care. Some necessary steps for health care workers.,2020-03-25,"BACKGROUND Wnt/β-catenin signaling is known to play an important role in colorectal cancer (CRC). Niclosamide, a salicylamide derivative used in the treatment of tapeworm infections, targets the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The objective of this study was to investigate niclosamide as a therapeutic agent against CRC. METHODS The antiproliferative effects of 1, 3, 10, and 50 μM concentrations of niclosamide on human (SW480 and SW620) and rodent (CC531) CRC cell lines were determined by MTS assay and direct cell count. The lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1/transcription factor (LEF/TCF) reporter assay monitored the activity of Wnt signaling. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated the expression pattern of active β-catenin. Gene expression of canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling components was analyzed using qRT-PCR. Western blot analysis was performed with antibodies detecting nuclear localization of β-catenin and c-jun. RESULTS Cell proliferation in CRC cell lines was blocked dose dependently after 12 and 24 h of incubation. The Wnt promoter activity of LEF/TCF significantly decreased with niclosamide concentrations of 10 and 50 μM after 12 h of incubation. Active β-catenin did not shift from the nuclear to the cytosolic pool. However, canonical target genes (met, MMP7, and cyclin D1) as well as the coactivating factor Bcl9 were downregulated, whereas the noncanonical key player c-jun was clearly activated. CONCLUSIONS Niclosamide treatment is associated with an inhibitory effect on CRC development and reduced Wnt activity. It may exert its effect by interfering with the nuclear β-catenin-Bcl9-LEF/TCF triple-complex and by upregulation of c-jun representing noncanonical Wnt/JNK signaling. Thus, our findings warrant further research into this substance as a treatment option for patients with advanced CRC.","Monin, Malte B; Krause, Petra; Stelling, Robin; Bocuk, Derya; Niebert, Sabine; Klemm, Florian; Pukrop, Tobias; Koenig, Sarah",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2016.03.051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27338550/,856

Therefore, this study aimed to examine the associations of health behaviors, food preferences, and with the incidence of MCI. METHODS All participants aged ≥ 55 years were potential eligible. The types of health behaviors and food preferences were recorded using the valid questionnaire. The obesity patterns were defined as follows:G-/A-, G+/A- or G-/A+, and G+/A+. The cognition tests included immediate and delayed recall, counting backward from 20, and serial 7 subtraction. The total cognitive score ranged from 0 to 27. Subjects with a score < 7 were considered as MCI. RESULTS There were 8236 subjects included in this study. Martial arts, ping pong, and reading or writing were associated with the lower incident MCI (P = 0.039, 0.006, and 0.016, respectively). However, TV or computer usage was associated with the higher incident MCI (P = 0.029; HR: 1.455; and HR 95% CI: 1.040- 2.036). Fast foods, soft/sugared drinks, and salty snack foods increased the incident MCI (P< 0.001, = 0.032, and 0.002, respectively). G+/A- or G-/A+ and G+/A+ were associated with the lower incident MCI (P = 0.018 and < 0.001, respectively). LIMITATIONS The basic mechanisms of health behaviors, food preferences, and obesity patterns on the risk of MCI were not fully explained. CONCLUSION Reading or writing and G+/A+ were associated with the lower incident MCI. However, TV or computer usage and fast foods were associated with the higher incident MCI.","Feng, Tianda; Feng, Ziyi; Jiang, Lili; Yu, Qi; Liu, Kuiran",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734905/,856
108317,Early trends of socio-economic and health indicators influencing case fatality rate of COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-07-22,"BACKGROUND Pancreatic fistula continues to be a source of significant morbidity following distal pancreatic resections. The technique of pancreatic division varies widely among surgeons, and there is no evidence that identifies a single method as superior. In our practice, the technique of distal pancreatic resection has evolved from cut-and-sew to stapled technique with green and recently white cartridge. The aim of our study was to evaluate the rate of clinically significant fistulas [International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) grade B or C] following distal pancreatectomy and to identify variables associated with a low rate of fistula development. METHODS Clinical records of all patients who underwent distal pancreatic resections between February 1999 and July 2010 by a single surgeon were retrospectively reviewed focusing on the incidence and type of pancreatic fistula as defined by ISGPF. Study variables included age, gender, surgical approach, extent of resection, ASA classification, type of stapler cartridge, use of Seamguard™, and ISGPF classification. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS Sixty-four patients (median age 60, range 21-85; 54% male) underwent distal pancreatic resection (laparoscopy 50% vs. open 50%). The most common indications were pancreatic adenocarcinoma (N = 15; 23%) and neuroendocrine neoplasms (N = 14; 22%). Clinically significant pancreatic fistula developed in 24% (N = 15). The rate of fistula with cut-and-sew technique was 36% (4/11), with stapled green cartridge 31% (9/29) and only 5% (1/21) with stapled vascular cartridge. Univariate logistic regression identified vascular cartridge size (p = 0.04, OR 0.11) and open stapled technique (p = 0.05, OR 0.12) as variables significantly associated with a low fistula rate. Both vascular cartridge size (p = 0.05, OR 0.10) and open stapled technique (p = 0.04, OR 0.08) remained significant when analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. Division of pancreatic parenchyma with vascular cartridges resulted in significantly (p = 0.03, OR 9.0) lower fistula rate compared to green cartridges. The use of Seamguard™ did not affect fistula rate (16% vs. 27%; p = 0.34) nor did the performance of multivisceral resection vs. distal pancreatectomy/splenectomy alone (21% vs. 23%, p = 1.0). CONCLUSION The optimal technique of pancreatic division has not been conclusively established. Dividing the pancreas utilizing vascular (2.5 mm) staple cartridges significantly decreased the rate of clinically significant pancreatic fistula and we have changed our practice accordingly. A prospective randomized trial is necessary to validate these results.","Sepesi, Boris; Moalem, Jacob; Galka, Eva; Salzman, Peter; Schoeniger, Luke O",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-011-1715-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22015618/,856

Given existing health disparities and research on minority stress, COVID-19 may have uniquely impacted psychological well-being among sexual minorities. In an online survey of adults in the U.S. (N = 1,007) conducted in April 2020, we examined differences between sexual minority and heterosexual participants in psychological well-being, social distancing, computer-mediated communication, and COVID-19-related worry and experiences. Sexual minorities reported lower thriving and greater psychological distress, social distancing, computer-mediated communication, and COVID-19 worry and experiences than heterosexual participants. Social distancing and distress were positively correlated among sexual minorities and more frequent computer-mediated communication predicted greater thriving across groups. Path analyses showed sexual minorities' poorer psychological well-being was mediated by their greater COVID-19 worry and social distancing, in particular.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the methods and results of the first year of structured implementation of a colorectal ERAS program in two surgical units of the Azienda Sanitaria Unica Regionale (ASUR) Marche in Italy. A two-center observational study on a prospectively maintained database was performed on 196 consecutive colorectal resections (excluding emergencies and American Society of Anesthesiologists class > III cases) over a 1-year period. More than 50 variables including adherence to the individual items of the ERAS program were considered. Primary outcomes were overall morbidity, major morbidity, mortality and anastomotic leakage rates; secondary outcomes were LOS, re-admission and re-operation. The results were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses through logistic regression. After a median follow-up of 39.5 days, we recorded complications in 72 patients (overall morbidity 36.7%), major complications in 14 patients (major morbidity 7.1%), 6 deaths (mortality 3.1%), anastomotic dehiscence in 9 cases (4.9%), mean overall LOS of 6.6 days, 10 readmissions (5.1%) and 13 reoperations (6.7%). The mean adherence rate to the items of the ERAS program was 85.4%, showing a significant dose-effect curve for overall and major morbidity rates, anastomotic leakage rates and LOS. The implementation methods of a colorectal ERAS program in this study led to a high adherence (> 80%) to the program items. High adherence had significant effects also on major morbidity and anastomotic leakage rates.","Catarci, Marco; Benedetti, Michele; Maurizi, Angela; Spinelli, Francesco; Bernacconi, Tonino; Guercioni, Gianluca; Campagnacci, Roberto",Updates in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13304-020-00885-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33094366/,856

Endovascular treatment of this segment offers a significant alternative to surgical revascularization, and may confer improved safety for a wide range of patients, not solely those deemed high surgical risk. Although endovascular therapy of the FP segment has historically been hampered by high rates of restenosis, emerging technologies including drug-eluting stents, drug-coated balloons, and perhaps bio-absorbable stent platforms, provide future hope for more durable patency in complex disease.

Efficient delivery of DOX is ensured due to its hollow microstructure, and a typical pH-responsive drug release is enabled. More importantly, the intracellular DOX, in addition to its intrinsic antitumour properties, induces extra exogenous H2O2 which favors the production of ˙OH by H-NiFe(OH)x in tumour cells. In consequence, remarkable in vitro and in vivo antitumour properties are successfully achieved.

Though many chemical and physical cues which influence the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs have been explored, scaffolds combining the benefits of Zn2+ ions and unique nanostructures may become an ideal interface to enhance osteogenic and anti-infective capabilities simultaneously. In this work, motivated by the enormous advantages of Zn-based metal-organic framework-derived nanocarbons, C-ZnO nanocarbons-modified fibrous scaffolds for stem cell-based osteogenic differentiation are constructed. The modified scaffolds show enhanced expression of alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, vinculin, and a larger cell spreading area. Meanwhile, the caging of ZnO nanoparticles can allow the slow release of Zn2+ ions, which not only activate various signaling pathways to guide osteogenic differentiation but also prevent the potential bacterial infection of implantable scaffolds. Overall, this study may provide new insight for designing stem cell-based nanostructured fibrous scaffolds with simultaneously enhanced osteogenic and anti-infective capabilities.","Xia, Yi; Fan, Xin; Yang, Hua; Li, Ling; He, Chao; Cheng, Chong; Haag, Rainer",Small,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202003010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32815251/,856

Objective To identify the optimal triage and transport strategy: direct to the endovascular center (mothership) or immediate alteplase treatment followed by transfer to the endovascular center (drip and ship), for all patients with suspected large-vessel occlusion stroke. Design Setting, and Participants This was a theoretical, conditional probability modeling study. Existing data from clinical trials of stroke treatment were used for model generation. The study was conducted from February 1, 2017, to March 1, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures The time-dependent efficacy of alteplase and endovascular therapy and the accuracy of large-vessel occlusion screening tools were modeled to estimate the probability of positive outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-1 at 90 days) for both the drip-and-ship and mothership transport strategies. Based from onset to treatment, the strategy that estimates the greatest probability of excellent outcome is determined in several different scenarios. Results The patient's travel time from both thrombolysis and endovascular therapy centers, speed of treatment, and positive predictive value of the screening tool affect whether the drip-and-ship or mothership strategy estimates best outcomes. With optimal treatment times (door-to-needle time: 30 minutes; door-in-door-out time: 50 minutes; door-to-groin-puncture time: 60 minutes [mothership], 30 minutes [drip and ship]), both options estimate similar outcomes when the centers are 60 minutes or less apart. However, with increasing travel time between the 2 centers (90 or 120 minutes), drip and ship is favored if the patient would have to travel past the thrombolysis center to reach the endovascular therapy center or if the patient would arrive outside the alteplase treatment time window in the mothership scenario. Holding other variables constant, if treatment times are slow at the thrombolysis center (door-to-needle time: 60 minutes; door-in-door-out time: 120 minutes), the area where mothership estimates the best outcomes expands, especially when the 2 centers are close together (60 minutes apart or less). The area where mothership estimates the best outcome also expands as the positive predictive value of the screening tool increases. Conclusions and Relevance This study suggests that decision making for prehospital transport can be modeled using existing clinical trial data and that these models can be dynamically adapted to changing realities. Based on current median treatment times to realize the full benefit of endovascular therapy on a population level, the study findings suggest that delivery of the treatment should be regionally centralized. The study modeling suggests that transport decision making is context specific and the radius of superiority of the transport strategy changes based on treatment times at both centers, transport times, and the triaging tool used.","Holodinsky, Jessalyn K; Williamson, Tyler S; Demchuk, Andrew M; Zhao, Henry; Zhu, Luke; Francis, Michael J; Goyal, Mayank; Hill, Michael D; Kamal, Noreen",JAMA neurology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2018.2424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30193366/,856

METHODS All women who underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy at Paul's Hospital between January 2004 and April 2012 were included in the study. Patients who had bleeding per vaginam between 24 hours and 6 weeks after primary surgery were included in the analysis. RESULTS A total of 1613 patients underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy during the study period, and 21 patients had secondary hemorrhage after hysterectomy. The overall cumulative incidence of secondary hemorrhage after total laparoscopic hysterectomy was 1.3%. The mean size of the uterus was 541.4 g in the secondary hemorrhage group and 318.9 g in patients without hemorrhage, which was statistically significant. The median time interval between hysterectomy and secondary hemorrhage was 13 days. Packing was sufficient to control the bleeding in 13 patients, and 6 patients required vault suturing. Laparoscopic coagulation of the uterine artery was performed in 1 patient. Uterine artery embolization was performed twice in 1 patient to control the bleeding. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that secondary hemorrhage is rare but may occur more often after total laparoscopic hysterectomy than after other hysterectomy approaches. Whether it is related to the application of thermal energy to tissues, which causes more tissue necrosis and devascularization than sharp culdotomy in abdominal and vaginal hysterectomies, is not clear. A large uterus size, excessive use of an energy source for the uterine artery, and culdotomy may play a role.","Paul, P G; Prathap, Talwar; Kaur, Harneet; Shabnam, Khan; Kandhari, Dimple; Chopade, Gaurav",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2014.00139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25392609/,856

Case series of Sub-Intensive Care Unit in Naples, Italy.",2020-09-18,"BackgroundAccurate and early susceptibility results could reduce overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric treatment of bacteremia. Direct disk diffusion testing (dDD) using non-standardized inocula directly from blood cultures could facilitate earlier narrowing of antibiotics.MethodsTo determine the predictive value of dDD compared with standardized antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), we performed a retrospective cohort study of 582 blood cultures from 495 pediatric patients with bacteremia. Positive and negative predictive value (PPV: number of isolates susceptible by both dDD and AST divided by the total number of isolates susceptible by dDD; NPV: number of isolates not susceptible [either intermediate or resistant] by both dDD and AST divided by the total number of isolates not susceptible by dDD), sensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence interval were calculated for each bacterium-antibiotic combination. We evaluated the Antibiotic Spectrum Index of prescribed antibiotics to assess change in antibiotic prescribing after availability of Gram stain, dDD, and AST results.ResultsdDD results were available a median of 21 hours before AST results. dDD had PPVs of ≥96% for most organism-antibiotic pairs, including 100% (CI 96-100%) for Staphylococcus aureus and oxacillin and 99% (CI 93%-100%) for Enterobacterales and ceftriaxone. NPVs of dDD were variable and frequently lower than PPV. Very major errors and major errors occurred in 31/5454 (0.6%) and 231/5454 (4.2%) organism-antibiotic combinations, respectively. Antibiotics were narrowed in 30% of cases after dDD result and a further 25% of cases after AST result.ConclusionsdDD is highly predictive of susceptibility for many common organism-antibiotic combinations and provides actionable information one day earlier than standard susceptibility approaches. dDD has the potential to facilitate earlier de-escalation to narrow-spectrum antibiotic treatment.","Savage, Timothy J; Rao, Shun; Joerger, Jill; Ozonoff, Al; McAdam, Alexander J; Sandora, Thomas J",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02445-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692138/,856

Our experience and The New Modified Criteria Clinical Radiological Physiological (TNMC CRP) score for sarcoidosis: A novel proposition to assess the functional status.,2021-02-15,"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an economically important enteropathogen of swine with worldwide distribution. PDCoV primarily infects the small intestine instead of the large intestine in vivo However, the underlying mechanism of PDCoV tropism to different intestinal segments remains poorly understood as a result of the lack of a suitable in vitro intestinal model that recapitulates the cellular diversity and complex functions of the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we established the PDCoV infection model of crypt-derived enteroids from different intestinal segments. Enteroids were susceptible to PDCoV and multiple types of different functional intestinal epithelia were infected by PDCoV in vitro and in vivo We further found that PDCoV favorably infected the jejunum and ileum, and restrictedly replicated in the duodenum and colon. Mechanistically, enteroids from different intestinal regions displayed a distinct gene expression profile, and the differential expression of primary viral receptor host aminopeptidase N (APN) instead of the IFN responses determined the susceptibility of different intestinal segments to PDCoV although PDCoV substantially elicited antiviral genes production in enteroids after infection. Additional studies showed that PDCoV infection significantly induced the expression of type I and III IFNs at the late stage of infection, and exogenous IFN inhibited PDCoV replication in enteroids. Hence, our results provide critical inputs to further dissect the molecular mechanisms of PDCoV-host interactions and pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE The zoonotic potential of the PDCoV, a coronavirus efficiently infecting cells from broad species including porcine, chicken and human, emphasizes the urgent need to further study the cell and tissue tropism of PDCoV in its natural host. Herein, we generated crypt stem cell-derived enteroids from porcine different intestinal regions, which well recapitulated the events in vivo of PDCoV infection that PDCoV targeted multiple types of intestinal epithelia and preferably infected the jejunum and ileum compared with the duodenum and colon. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the expression of APN receptor rather than the IFN responses determined the susceptibility of different regions of the intestines to PDCoV infection though PDCoV infection markedly elicited the IFN responses. Our findings provide important insights into how the distinct gene expression profiles of the intestinal segments determine the cell and tissue tropism of PDCoV.","Yin, Lingdan; Chen, Jianfei; Li, Liang; Guo, Shanshan; Xue, Mei; Zhang, Jialin; Liu, Xiang; Feng, Li; Liu, Pinghuang",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00480-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376622/,856

This type virus can cause severe illness and deaths, the situation raises many urgent questions and global public health concerns. Our purpose was to investigate bedside chest radiography findings for patients with novel influenza A (H7N9) virus infections and the followup appearances after short-time treatment. METHODS Eight hospitalized patients infected with the novel influenza A (H7N9) virus were included in our study. All of the patients underwent bedside chest radiography after admission, and all had follow-up bedside chest radiography during their first ten days, using AXIOM Aristos MX and/or AMX-IV portable X-ray units. The exposure dose was generally 90 kV and 5 mAs, and was slightly adjusted according to the weight of the patients. The initial radiography data were evaluated for radiological patterns (ground glass opacity, consolidation, and reticulation), distribution type (focal, multifocal, and diffuse), lung zones involved, and appearance at follow-up while the patients underwent therapy. RESULTS All patients presented with bilateral multiple lung involvement. Two patients had bilateral diffuse lesions, three patients had unilateral diffuse lesions of the right lobe with multifocal lesions of the left lobe, and the remaining three had bilateral multifocal lung lesions. The lesions were present throughout bilateral lung zones in three patients, the whole right lung zone in three patients with additional involvement in the left middle and/or lower lung zone(s), both lower and middle lung zones in one patient, and the right middle and lower in combination with the left lower lung zones in one patient. The most common abnormal radiographic patterns were ground glass opacity (8/8), and consolidation (8/8). In three cases examined by CT we also found the pattern of reticulation in combination with CT images. Four patients had bilateral and four had unilateral pleural effusion. After a short period of treatment the pneumonia in one patient had significantly improved and three cases demonstrated disease progression. In four cases the severity of the pneumonia fluctuated. CONCLUSIONS In patients with influenza A (H7N9) virus infection, the distribution of the lung lesions are extensive, and the disease usually involves both lung zones. The most common imaging findings are a mixture of ground glass opacity and consolidation. Pleural effusion is common. Most cases have a poor short-time treatment response, and seem to have either rapid progressive radiographic deterioration or fluctuating radiographic changes. Chest radiography is helpful for evaluating patients with severe clinical symptoms and for follow-up evaluation.","Song, Feng-xiang; Zhou, Jun; Shi, Yu-xin; Zhang, Zhi-yong; Feng, Feng; Zhou, Jian-jun; Wang, Qing-le",Chinese medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24286403/,856

226468,COVID-19 pandemic: what consequences for cardiac rehabilitation?,2020,"Due to their distinct and useful features, multi-color-emissive carbon dots (CDs) have gained much attention, however, their lack of red emission has so far limited their practical use for various applications, thus understanding of their emission origins is required. Concentration-dependent photoluminescence (PL) is a unique feature of CDs and is regarded as one way to realize tunable PL, providing information on their PL mechanism. In this work, we synthesized concentration-dependent blue/red dual-color-emissive CDs under single excitation at 365 nm. With the increase in concentration, the blue emission band showed a large red-shift from 431 to 500 nm, while the red emission band at around 650 nm showed only a relative intensity change, without a significant spectral shift. We performed spectroscopic analysis by changing the solution environment including the solvent type and pH to investigate the origins of the two emission bands. These results, combined with the zeta potential and fluorescence microscopy results, confirmed that the interparticle distance of CDs is a key factor for their dual-emissive PL behavior. With the advantage of unique PL features, we showed the potential of the CDs for white light-emitting diode (WLED) and ratiometric pH sensing applications.","Yoo, Hyo Jeong; Kwak, Byeong Eun; Kim, Do Hyun",,,856
232542,Emerging prophylaxis strategies against COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread worldwide. Researchers are trying to find a way to treat this disease as soon as possible. The present study aimed to identify the genes involved in COVID-19 and find a new drug target therapy. Currently, there are no effective drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2, and meanwhile, drug discovery approaches are time-consuming and costly. To address this challenge, this study utilized a network-based drug repurposing strategy to rapidly identify potential drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2. To this end, seven potential drugs were proposed for COVID-19 treatment using protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. First, 524 proteins in humans that have interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 virus were collected, and then the PPI network was reconstructed for these collected proteins. Next, the target miRNAs of the mentioned module genes were separately obtained from the miRWalk 2.0 database because of the important role of miRNAs in biological processes and were reported as an important clue for future analysis. Finally, the list of the drugs targeting module genes was obtained from the DGIDb database, and the drug-gene network was separately reconstructed for the obtained protein modules. RESULTS: Based on the network analysis of the PPI network, seven clusters of proteins were specified as the complexes of proteins which are more associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Moreover, seven therapeutic candidate drugs were identified to control gene regulation in COVID-19. PACLITAXEL, as the most potent therapeutic candidate drug and previously mentioned as a therapy for COVID-19, had four gene targets in two different modules. The other six candidate drugs, namely, BORTEZOMIB, CARBOPLATIN, CRIZOTINIB, CYTARABINE, DAUNORUBICIN, and VORINOSTAT, some of which were previously discovered to be efficient against COVID-19, had three gene targets in different modules. Eventually, CARBOPLATIN, CRIZOTINIB, and CYTARABINE drugs were found as novel potential drugs to be investigated as a therapy for COVID-19.

The secondary aims were to assess whether there were clinical factors associated with COVID-19 status, the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19, and the rate of potential COVID-19 in patients not presenting to healthcare services. METHODS: A multicentre retrospective study was conducted of patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (1 March 2020 to 31 March 2020) with a minimum of 60 days follow-up. Patient demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, procedure type, primary or revision, length of stay (LOS), COVID-19 test status, and postoperative mortality were recorded. A subgroup of patients (n = 211) who had not presented to healthcare services after discharge were contacted and questioned as to whether they had symptoms of COVID-19. RESULTS: Five (0.5%) of 1,073 patients who underwent hip or knee arthroplasty tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 postoperatively. When adjusting for confounding factors, increasing LOS (p = 0.022) was the only significant factor associated with developing COVID-19 following surgery and a stay greater than three days was a reliable predictor with an area under the curve of 81% (p = 0.018). There were three (0.3%) deaths in the study cohort and the overall mortality rate attributable to COVID-19 was 0.09% (n = 1/1,073), with one (20%) of the five patients with COVID-19 dying postoperatively. Of the 211 patients contacted, two had symptoms within two to 14 days postoperatively with a positive predictive value of 31% and it was therefore estimated that one patient may have had undiagnosed COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The rate of postoperative COVID-19 was 0.5% and may have been as high as 1% when accounting for those patients not presenting to healthcare services, which was similar to the estimated population prevalence during the study period. The overall mortality rate secondary to COVID-19 was low (0.09%), however the mortality rate for those patients developing COVID-19 was 20%.

433358,"Recovering of oxygenation, physical function and disability in patients with COVID-19",2021,"OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused dramatic changes in medical education. Social distancing policies have resulted in the rapid adoption of virtual learning (VL) by neurosurgeons as a method to exchange knowledge, but it has been met with variable acceptance. The authors surveyed neurosurgeons from around the world regarding their opinions about VL and how they see the future of neurosurgical conferences. METHODS: The authors conducted a global online survey assessing the experience of neurosurgeons and trainees with VL activities. They also questioned respondents about how they see the future of on-site conferences and scientific meetings. They analyzed responses against demographic data, regions in which the respondents practice, and socioeconomic factors by using frequency histograms and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: Eight hundred ninety-one responses from 96 countries were received. There has been an increase in VL activities since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most respondents perceive this type of learning as positive. Respondents from lower-income nations and regions such as Europe and Central Asia were more receptive to these changes and wanted to see further movement of educational activities (conferences and scientific meetings) into a VL format. The latter desire may be driven by financial savings from not traveling. Most queried neurosurgeons indicated that virtual events are likely to partially replace on-site events. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has improved perceptions of VL, and despite its limitations, VL has been well received by the majority of neurosurgeons. Lower-income nations in particular are embracing this technology. VL is still evolving, but its integration with traditional in-person meetings seems inevitable.","El-Ghandour, Nasser M F; Ezzat, Ahmed A M; Zaazoue, Mohamed A; Gonzalez-Lopez, Pablo; Jhawar, Balraj S; Soliman, Mohamed A R",Neurosurg Focus,,856

As of March 23, 2021, the outbreak has infected 124,313,054 worldwide with a total death of 2,735,707. The use of traditional medicines as an adjuvant therapy with western drugs can lower the fatality rate due to the COVID-19. Therefore, in silico molecular docking study was performed to search potential phytochemicals and drugs that can block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells by inhibiting the proteolytic cleavage activity of furin and TMPRSS2. Experimental procedure: The protein-protein docking of the host proteases furin and TMPRSS2 was carried out with the virus spike (S) protein to examine the conformational details and residues involved in the complex formation. Subsequently, a library of 163 ligands containing phytochemicals and drugs was virtually screened to propose potential hits that can inhibit the proteolytic cleavage activity of furin and TMPRSS2. Results and conclusion: The phytochemicals like limonin, gedunin, eribulin, pedunculagin, limonin glycoside and betunilic acid bind at the active site of both furin and TMPRSS2. Limonin and gedunin found mainly in the citrus fruits and neem showed the highest binding energy at the active site of furin and TMPRSS2, respectively. The polyphenols found in green tea can also be useful in suppressing the furin activity.

478494,COVID-19 reinfection - An enigmatic public health threat,2020,"The worldwide epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is ongoing. Rapid and accurate detection of the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 is vital for the treatment and control of COVID-19. In this study, the comparative sensitivity of different respiratory specimen types were retrospectively analyzed using 3,552 clinical samples from 410 COVID-19 patients confirmed by Guangdong CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention). Except for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (73.4%-87.5%), followed by nasal swabs (53.1%-85.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o.). Viral RNA could be detected in all BALF samples collected from the severe group within 14 d.a.o. and lasted up to 46 d.a.o. Moreover, although viral RNA was negative in the upper respiratory samples, it was also positive in BALF samples in most cases from the severe group during treatment. Notably, no viral RNA was detected in BALF samples from the mild group. Despite typical ground-glass opacity observed via computed tomographic scans, no viral RNA was detected in the first three or all upper respiratory tract specimens from some COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, sputum is most sensitive for routine laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, followed by nasal swabs. Detection of viral RNA in BALF improves diagnostic accuracy in severe COVID-19 patients.","Yang, Yang; Yang, Minghui; Yuan, Jing; Wang, Fuxiang; Wang, Zhaoqin; Li, Jinxiu; Zhang, Mingxia; Xing, Li; Wei, Jinli; Peng, Ling; Wong, Gary; Zheng, Haixia; Wu, Weibo; Shen, Chenguang; Liao, Mingfeng; Feng, Kai; Li, Jianming; Yang, Qianting; Zhao, Juanjuan; Liu, Lei; Liu, Yingxia",Innovation (N Y),,856
481837,COVID-19: Avoiding a second tragedy in a tuberculosis burdened country,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly, sending the world into a great panic. Healthcare professionals have responded by embarking on a concerted search for therapies to cure and prevent COVID-19. Recently, interferon (IFN) has emerged as a potential therapy as it is associated with reducing lung inflammation and suppressing viral replication. This research paper assessed the efficacy of high-dose nebulized IFN α 2b in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This is a retrospective study. It commenced on April 9 and ended on June 17, 2020. Researchers selected participants from hospitalized patients aged 18 years and above who were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Other inclusion criteria were bilateral pneumonia on lung or chest X-ray scan and severe respiratory distress. SMART-COP, which is a risk stratification scoring tool, and radiologic severity index (RSI) were used to assess pneumonia severity. Patients in the treatment cohort received nebulized IFN α 2b at a dose of 10 million IU every 12 hours for 5 days, in addition to standard treatment. Patients in the control cohort received standard treatment only. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients met the inclusion criteria;37 were included in the treatment cohort and 36 in the control cohort. Mechanical ventilation was needed in 14 of 36 (38.9%) patients in the control cohort, compared with 6 of 37 (27.4%) patients in the treatment cohort (HR 5.62 [95% CI 1.81-17.48];P = .003). For pneumonia severity, there was a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.72 [95% CI 1.74-7.98];P = ·.01. After 5 days of treatment, chest X-rays indicated significant beneficial changes in the treatment group (HR 2.24 [CI 1.05-4.79];P = .036). Multivariate analysis revealed that pneumonia severity and RSI remained higher in the control group. The HR was 3.44 [95% CI 1.49-7.94];P = .004 and 2.26 [95% CI 0.99-5.16];P = .05, respectively. There was an increase in liver aminotransferases in 5 (14%) participants in the control cohort and 3 (8%) participants in the treatment cohort. CONCLUSION: High-dose nebulized IFN α 2b has potential efficacy in mitigating severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This study established that administering high-dose nebulized IFN α 2b significantly reduces pneumonia severity in COVID-19 patients. We also found a strong relationship between using nebulized IFN α 2b and reduced need for mechanical ventilation among patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. However, a well-designed control trial is needed to confirm the drug's efficacy in reducing the COVID-19 pneumonia severity.","Chkhis, A.; Abdulrazzaq, N.; Mokhtar, S.; Al Jasmi, A.",Turkish Thoracic Journal,,856
481838,COVID-19: Avoiding a second tragedy in a tuberculosis burdened country,2020,"AIM: The study aim was to determine relevance and applicability of generic predictors of clinical deterioration in emergency departments based on consensus among clinicians. METHODS: Thirty-three predictors of clinical deterioration identified from literature were assessed in a modified two-stage Delphi-process. Sixty-eight clinicians (physicians and nurses) participated in the first round and 48 in the second round; all treating hospitalized patients in Danish emergency departments, some with pre-hospital experience. The panel rated the predictors for relevance (relevant marker of clinical deterioration) and applicability (change in clinical presentation over time, generic in nature and possible to detect bedside). They rated their level of agreement on a 9-point Likert scale and were also invited to propose additional generic predictors between the rounds. New predictors suggested by more than one clinician were included in the second round along with non-consensus predictors from the first round. Final decisions of non-consensus predictors after second round were made by a research group and an impartial physician. RESULTS: The Delphi-process resulted in 19 clinically relevant and applicable predictors based on vital signs and parameters (respiratory rate, saturation, dyspnoea, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, abnormal electrocardiogram, altered mental state and temperature), biochemical tests (serum c-reactive protein, serum bicarbonate, serum lactate, serum pH, serum potassium, glucose, leucocyte counts and serum haemoglobin), objective clinical observations (skin conditions) and subjective clinical observations (pain reported as new or escalating, and relatives' concerns). CONCLUSION: The Delphi-process led to consensus of 19 potential predictors of clinical deterioration widely accepted as relevant and applicable in emergency departments.","Boier Tygesen, Gitte; Kirkegaard, Hans; Raaber, Nikolaj; Trøllund Rask, Mette; Lisby, Marianne",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,,856

484515,A review of the presentation and outcome of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in COVID-19,2021,"High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are a class of blood particles, principally involved in mediating reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissue to liver. Omics approaches have identified crucial mediators in the HDL proteomic and lipidomic profile, which are involved in distinct pleiotropic functions. Besides their role as cholesterol transporter, HDLs display anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-thrombotic, and anti-infection properties. Experimental and clinical studies have unveiled significant changes in both HDL serum amount and composition that lead to dysregulated host immune response and endothelial dysfunction in the course of sepsis. Most SARS-Coronavirus-2-infected patients admitted to the intensive care unit showed common features of sepsis disease, such as the overwhelmed systemic inflammatory response and the alterations in serum lipid profile. Despite relevant advances, episodes of mild to moderate acute kidney injury (AKI), occurring during systemic inflammatory diseases, are associated with long-term complications, and high risk of mortality. The multi-faceted relationship of kidney dysfunction with dyslipidemia and inflammation encourages to deepen the clarification of the mechanisms connecting these elements. This review analyzes the multifaced roles of HDL in inflammatory diseases, the renal involvement in lipid metabolism, and the novel potential HDL-based therapies.","Stasi, Alessandra; Franzin, Rossana; Fiorentino, Marco; Squiccimarro, Enrico; Castellano, Giuseppe; Gesualdo, Loreto",Int. j. mol. sci.

The quality of its IT systems, together with access to the results of mass screening with Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, makes it possible to analyse the impact of various concurrent factors on the likelihood of contracting the disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Through data mining techniques with the sociodemographic and clinical variables recorded in patient's medical histories, a decision tree-based logistic regression model has been proposed which analyses the significance of demographic and clinical variables in the probability of having a positive PCR in a sample of 7,314 individuals treated in the Primary Care service of the public health system of Catalonia. The statistical approach to decision tree modelling allows 66.2% of diagnoses of infection by COVID-19 to be classified with a sensitivity of 64.3% and a specificity of 62.5%, with prior contact with a positive case being the primary predictor variable. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a classification tree model may be useful in screening for COVID-19 infection. Contact detection is the most reliable variable for detecting Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases. The model would support that, beyond a symptomatic diagnosis, the best way to detect cases would be to engage in contact tracing.","Marin-Gomez, Francesc X; Fàbregas-Escurriola, Mireia; Seguí, Francesc López; Pérez, Eduardo Hermosilla; Camps, Mència Benítez; Peña, Jacobo Mendioroz; Comellas, Anna Ruiz; Vidal-Alaball, Josep",PLoS One,,856

There is little information about community pharmacists' on occupational exposure, symptoms development, and testing practices in the community pharmacist cohort. METHODS: Between April 30th and May 10th, a questionnaire was administered through social media to Italian community pharmacists. From 67000 pharmacists currently working in community pharmacies, 1632 answered the survey. RESULTS: The survey population reflected the general Italian community pharmacists population in terms of age, gender, and number of co-workers. Protective measures were adopted in up to 99.9% of pharmacies. 624 pharmacists (38.2%) developed at least one COVID-19 related symptom in the period between February 28th and May 10th. Also, 102 pharmacists (6.2%) were tested for COVID-19 and 15, the 15% of the tested population and 0.92% of the whole survey population, resulted positive on nasopharyngeal swab. However, while the number of symptomatic pharmacists decreased, a higher number of tests were performed, thus COVID-19 prevalence among community pharmacists could have been underestimated and is probably intermediate between other healthcare workers and the general population (0.31%). CONCLUSION: Community pharmacists have probably been one of the first categories to experience increased contact risk to SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 prevalence among pharmacists could have been underestimated. In addition, the rates of protection measures adoption might have helped to reduce the spread of COVID-19 among co-workers and the community.","Cabas, Paolo; Di Bella, Stefano; Giuffrè, Mauro; Rizzo, Michele; Trombetta, Carlo; Luzzati, Roberto; Antonello, Roberta Maria; Parenzan, Ketty; Liguori, Giovanni",Res. soc. adm. pharm,,856

She was evaluated in the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) for sleepiness that had progressively worsened during the last days. We describe the case and how it was handled differently by pediatricians and pediatric trainees with equally different personal and professional backgrounds.We also report the preliminary results of a national survey aimed to assess discrimination and inequalities in Italian Paediatric Residency Schools. Medical ability has been allowing us to respond rapidly to a novel virus in order to save lives.
