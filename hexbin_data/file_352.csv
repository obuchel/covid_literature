2361,Chinese Public Attention to the Outbreak of Ebola in West Africa: Evidence from the Online Big Data Platform,2016-08-03,"Objective: The outbreak of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014 exerted enormous global public reaction via the Internet and social media. This study aimed to investigate and evaluate the public reaction to Ebola in China and identify the primitive correlation between possible influence factors caused by the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and Chinese public attention via Internet surveillance. Methods: Baidu Index (BDI) and Sina Micro Index (SMI) were collected from their official websites, and the disease-related data were recorded from the websites of the World Health Organization (WHO), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and U.S. National Ministries of Health. The average BDI of Internet users in different regions were calculated to identify the public reaction to the Ebola outbreak. Spearman’s rank correlation was used to check the relationship of epidemic trends with BDI and SMI. Additionally, spatio-temporal analysis and autocorrelation analysis were performed to detect the clustered areas with the high attention to the topic of “Ebola”. The related news reports were collected from authoritative websites to identify potential patterns. Results: The BDI and the SMI for “Ebola” showed a similar fluctuating trend with a correlation coefficient = 0.9 (p < 0.05). The average BDI in Beijing, Tibet, and Shanghai was higher than other cities. However, the disease-related indicators did not identify potential correlation with both indices above. A hotspot area was detected in Tibet by local autocorrelation analysis. The most likely cluster identified by spatiotemporal cluster analysis was in the northeast regions of China with the relative risk (RR) of 2.26 (p ≤ 0.01) from 30 July to 14 August in 2014. Qualitative analysis indicated that negative news could lead to a continuous increase of the public’s attention until the appearance of a positive news report. Conclusions: Confronted with the risk of cross-border transmission of the infectious disease, online surveillance might be used as an innovative approach to perform public communication and health education through examining the public’s reaction and attitude.","Liu, Kui; Li, Li; Jiang, Tao; Chen, Bin; Jiang, Zhenggang; Wang, Zhengting; Chen, Yongdi; Jiang, Jianmin; Gu, Hua",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4997466/,352
3104,Near-Patient Sampling to Assist Infection Control—A Case Report and Discussion,2018-01-31,"Air sampling as an aid to infection control is still in an experimental stage, as there is no consensus about which air samplers and pathogen detection methods should be used, and what thresholds of specific pathogens in specific exposed populations (staff, patients, or visitors) constitutes a true clinical risk. This case report used a button sampler, worn or held by staff or left free-standing in a fixed location, for environmental sampling around a child who was chronically infected by a respiratory adenovirus, to determine whether there was any risk of secondary adenovirus infection to the staff managing the patient. Despite multiple air samples taken on difference days, coinciding with high levels of adenovirus detectable in the child’s nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), none of the air samples contained any detectable adenovirus DNA using a clinically validated diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Although highly sensitive, in-house PCR assays have been developed to detect airborne pathogen RNA/DNA, it is still unclear what level of specific pathogen RNA/DNA constitutes a true clinical risk. In this case, the absence of detectable airborne adenovirus DNA using a conventional diagnostic assay removed the requirement for staff to wear surgical masks and face visors when they entered the child’s room. No subsequent staff infections or outbreaks of adenovirus have so far been identified.","Tang, Julian W.; Hoyle, Elizabeth; Moran, Sammy; Pareek, Manish",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5858307/,352
10522,The Relationship Exploration between Public Migration Attention and Population Migration from a Perspective of Search Query,2020-04-01,"BACKGROUND: Prophylactic vaccines are critical in preventing hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) primarily caused by human enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection. Children aged less than 5 years are especially susceptible to EV71 infections. In addition to the development of vaccines containing the inactivated virus, those containing virus-like particles (VLPs) with repeated antigens also constitute an effective preventive strategy for EV71 infections, with safety and productivity advantages. We previously developed a fusion protein composed with truncated peptides of the EV71 capsid protein, which assembled into spherical particles. This study aimed to assess the immunoprotective effects of this fusion protein as a vaccine candidate in a mouse model of EV71 infection. METHODS: To evaluate the protective effect of fusion protein vaccine candidate, neonatal mice born by immunized female mice, as well as normal neonatal mice immunized twice were infected with EV71 virus. Whereafter, the survival rates, clinical scores and viral loads were measured. RESULTS: The high dosage and booster immunization helped induce specific serum antibodies with high neutralization titers, which were transferred to neonatal mice, thereby facilitating effective resistance towards EV71 infection. An active immune response was also observed in neonatal mice which generated following immunization. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that this fusion protein is a suitable vaccine candidate in treating EV71 infections.","Liu, Jiangning; Zhao, Binbin; Xue, Ling; Wu, Jing; Xu, Yanfeng; Liu, Yongdong; Qin, Chuan",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7178760/,352

13474,University Students’ Purchase Intention and Willingness to Pay for Carbon-Labeled Food Products: A Purchase Decision-Making Experiment,2020-09-25,"Novel H7N9 influenza virus transmitted from birds to human and, since March 2013, it has caused five epidemic waves in China. Although the evolution of H7N9 viruses has been investigated, the evolutionary changes associated with codon usage are still unclear. Herein, the codon usage pattern of two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), was studied to understand the evolutionary changes in relation to host, epidemic wave, and pathogenicity. Both genes displayed a low codon usage bias, with HA higher than NA. The codon usage was driven by mutation pressure and natural selection, although the main contributing factor was natural selection. Additionally, the codon adaptation index (CAI) and deoptimization (RCDI) illustrated the strong adaptability of H7N9 to Gallus gallus. Similarity index (SiD) analysis showed that Homo sapiens posed a stronger selection pressure than Gallus gallus. Thus, we assume that this may be related to the gradual adaptability of the virus to human. In addition, the host strong selection pressure was validated based on CpG dinucleotide content. In conclusion, this study analyzed the usage of codons of two genes of H7N9 and expanded our understanding of H7N9 host specificity. This aids into the development of control measures against H7N9 influenza virus.","Sun, Jiumeng; Zhao, Wen; Wang, Ruyi; Zhang, Wenyan; Li, Gairu; Lu, Meng; Shao, Yuekun; Yang, Yichen; Wang, Ningning; Gao, Qi; Su, Shuo",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7583936/,352

In the present paper, we discuss 50 LCPMS models, a number that is particularly meaningful when compared to the much smaller number of models described in other recent reviews on the same topic. After illustrating the basic definitions related to particulate matter (PM) and its measurements according to international regulations, the device’s operating principle is presented, focusing on a discussion of the several characterization methodologies proposed by various research groups, both in the lab and in the field, along with their possible limitations. We present an extensive review of the LCPMS currently available on the market, their electronic characteristics, and their applications in published literature and from specific tests. Most of the reviewed LCPMS can accurately monitor PM changes in the environment and exhibit good performances with accuracy that, in some conditions, can reach R(2) values up to 0.99. However, such results strongly depend on whether the device is calibrated or not (using a reference method) in the operative environment; if not, R(2) values lower than 0.5 are observed.","Alfano, Brigida; Barretta, Luigi; Del Giudice, Antonio; De Vito, Saverio; Di Francia, Girolamo; Esposito, Elena; Formisano, Fabrizio; Massera, Ettore; Miglietta, Maria Lucia; Polichetti, Tiziana",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7730878/,352
14546,How High-Polluting Firms Suffer from Being Distracted form Intended Purpose: A Corporate Social Responsibility Perspective,2020-12-09,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Expanded, antigen-experienced CD8(+) T cells are utilized in immunotherapy to treat infections and cancers. Antigen rechallenge of these cells leads to their re-expansion. The effector functions of re-expanded CD8(+) T cells are critical for their therapeutic efficacy. We found that acute conditioning of the cells, before antigen rechallenge, impacts their effector function after re-expansion. Our data showed that acute pharmacological modulation of the GSK3β-mTORC axis with TWS119 or rapamycin, but not Torin1, before antigen rechallenge promotes the effector functions of re-expanded CD8(+) T cells. These findings suggest that acute conditioning of the GSK3β-mTORC axis in expanded CD8(+) T cells, before antigen rechallenge, can promote the therapeutic performance of re-expanded CD8(+) T cells. ABSTRACT: CD8(+) T cells protect against tumors and intracellular pathogens. The inflammatory cytokines IL-2, IL-15, and IL-7 are necessary for their expansion. However, elevated serum levels of these cytokines are often associated with cancer, poorer prognosis of cancer patients, and exhaustion of antigen-expanded CD8(+) T cells. The impact of acute conditioning of antigen-expanded CD8(+) T cells with these cytokines is unknown. Here, we generated antigen-expanded CD8(+) T cells using dendritic cells and PC-3 cells. The cells were acutely (18–24 h) conditioned with IL-2 and either the GSK3β inhibitor TWS119, the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, or the mTORC1/2 inhibitor Torin1, then their immediate and post-re-expansion (distal) cytokine responses after antigen rechallenge were evaluated. We found that acute IL-2 conditioning upregulated the immediate antigen-induced cytokine response of the tested cells. Following their re-expansion, however, the cells showed a decreased cytokine response. These IL-2 conditioning-mediated impacts were counteracted with TWS119 or rapamycin but not with Torin1. Our data revealed that the acute conditioning of antigen-expanded CD8(+) T cells with IL-2 modulates the GSK3β-mTORC signaling axis. This modulation differentially affected the immediate and distal cytokine responses of the cells. The acute targeting of this signaling axis could, therefore, represent a novel strategy for the modulation of antigen-expanded CD8(+) T cells.","Taborska, Pavla; Stakheev, Dmitry; Svobodova, Hana; Strizova, Zuzana; Bartunkova, Jirina; Smrz, Daniel",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7765077/,352
14569,"Disparities in Risks of Malaria Associated with Climatic Variability among Women, Children and Elderly in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh",2020-12-17,"Neonates acquire from their mothers maternal antibody (MatAb) which results in poor immune response to vaccination. We previously demonstrated that ginseng stem-leaf saponins in combination with selenium (GSe) had adjuvant effect on the immune response to an attenuated pseudorabies virus (aPrV) vaccine. The present study was to evaluate GSe for its effect on the immune response to aPrV vaccine in neonatal mice with MatAb. Results showed that GSe had adjuvant effect on the immune response to aPrV vaccine in neonates. When GSe was co-administered with aPrV vaccine (aP-GSe), specific gB antibody, Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IL-12 and IFN-γ) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) responses were significantly increased in association with enhanced protection of vaccinated neonates against the lethal PrV challenge even though MatAb existed when compared to the neonates immunized with aPrV vaccine alone. GSe-enhanced immune response depended on its use in the primary immunization. The mechanisms underlying the adjuvant effect of GSe may be due to more innate immune related pathways activated by GSe. Transcriptome analysis of splenocytes from neonates immunized with aP-GSe, aPrV or saline solution showed that there were 3976 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in aP-GSe group while 5959 DEGs in aPrV group when compared to the control. Gene ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis showed that innate immune responses and cytokine productions related terms or pathways were predominantly enriched in aP-GSe group, such as “NOD-like receptor signaling pathway”, “Natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity”, “NF-κB signaling pathway”, “cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction”, and “Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation”. Considering the potent adjuvant effect of GSe on aPrV vaccine in neonatal mice with MatAb, it deserves further investigation in piglets.","Wang, Yong; Yuan, Lijia; Cui, Xuemei; Xu, Wei; Fang, Sijia; Li, Zoushuyi; Lu, Meiqian; Wu, Ye; Ma, Xiaodan; Chi, Xiaoqing; Hu, Songhua",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7768402/,352
14656,"Assessing the Impact of Street-View Greenery on Fear of Neighborhood Crime in Guangzhou, China",2021-01-04,"The EDR peptide (Glu-Asp-Arg) has been previously established to possess neuroprotective properties. It activates gene expression and synthesis of proteins, involved in maintaining the neuronal functional activity, and reduces the intensity of their apoptosis in in vitro and in vivo studies. The EDR peptide interferes with the elimination of dendritic spines in neuronal cultures obtained from mice with Alzheimer’s (AD) and Huntington’s diseases. The tripeptide promotes the activation of the antioxidant enzyme synthesis in the culture of cerebellum neurons in rats. The EDR peptide normalizes behavioral responses in animal studies and improves memory issues in elderly patients. The purpose of this review is to analyze the molecular and genetics aspects of the EDR peptide effect on gene expression and synthesis of proteins involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The EDR peptide is assumed to enter cells and bind to histone proteins and/or ribonucleic acids. Thus, the EDR peptide can change the activity of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, the synthesis of proapoptotic proteins (caspase-3, p53), proteins of the antioxidant system (SOD2, GPX1), transcription factors PPARA, PPARG, serotonin, calmodulin. The abovementioned signaling pathway and proteins are the components of pathogenesis in AD.

14876,Effectiveness and Challenges in Local Self-Governance: Multifunctional Autonomy in Japan,2021-01-12,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The onco-immunotherapeutic viruses, among which stand the onco-immunotherapeutic herpes simplex viruses, have gained renewed interest due to their ability to unlock the potential of checkpoint inhibitors in preclinical and clinical settings. In prior decades, safety concerns led to the generation of overall safe, partially or highly attenuated oncolytic viruses. Current focus is on more efficacious onco-immunotherapeutic viruses with limited ability to cause off-tumor and off-target infections and the capability to subvert the tumor microenvironment immunosuppression—hence to potentiate checkpoint inhibitors. These viruses might serve as potential partners of T-cell therapies. ABSTRACT: Our laboratory has pursued the generation of cancer-specific oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (oHSVs) which ensure high efficacy while maintaining a high safety profile. Their blueprint included retargeting to a Tumor-Associated Antigen, e.g., HER2, coupled to detargeting from natural receptors to avoid off-target and off-tumor infections and preservation of the full complement of unmodified viral genes. These oHSVs are “fully virulent in their target cancer cells”. The 3rd generation retargeted oHSVs carry two distinct retargeting moieties, which enable infection of a producer cell line and of the target cancer cells, respectively. They can be propagated in an ad hoc Vero cell derivative at about tenfold higher yields than 1st generation recombinants, and more effectively replicate in human cancer cell lines. The R-335 and R-337 prototypes were armed with murine IL-12. Intratumorally-administered R-337 conferred almost complete protection from LLC-1-HER2 primary tumors, unleashed the tumor microenvironment immunosuppression, synergized with the checkpoint blockade and conferred long-term vaccination against distant challenge tumors. In summary, the problem intrinsic to the propagation of retargeted oHSVs—which strictly require cells positive for targeted receptors—was solved in 3rd generation viruses. They are effective as immunotherapeutic agents against primary tumors and as antigen-agnostic vaccines.","Vannini, Andrea; Leoni, Valerio; Sanapo, Mara; Gianni, Tatiana; Giordani, Giorgia; Gatta, Valentina; Barboni, Catia; Zaghini, Anna; Campadelli-Fiume, Gabriella",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7828196/,352

Smoking has been associated with MS in observational studies and is often thought of as an environmental risk factor. We used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to examine whether this association is causal using genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) as associated with smoking. We assessed both smoking initiation and lifetime smoking behaviour (which captures smoking duration, heaviness, and cessation). There was very limited evidence for a meaningful effect of smoking on MS susceptibility as measured using summary statistics from the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) meta-analysis, including 14,802 cases and 26,703 controls. There was no clear evidence for an effect of smoking on the risk of developing MS (smoking initiation: odds ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92–1.61; lifetime smoking: OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.87–1.40). These findings suggest that smoking does not have a detrimental consequence on MS susceptibility.

We provide a reference atlas of human lung endothelial cells (ECs) to facilitate a better understanding of the phenotypic diversity and composition of cells comprising the lung endothelium. METHODS: We reprocessed human control single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from 6 datasets. EC populations were characterized through iterative clustering with subsequent differential expression analysis. Marker genes were validated by fluorescent microscopy and in situ hybridization. scRNAseq of primary lung ECs cultured in vitro was performed. The signaling network between different lung cell types was studied. For cross-species analysis or disease relevance, we applied the same methods to scRNAseq data obtained from mouse lungs or from human lungs with pulmonary hypertension. RESULTS: Six lung scRNAseq datasets were reanalyzed and annotated to identify >15 000 vascular EC cells from 73 individuals. Differential expression analysis of EC revealed signatures corresponding to endothelial lineage, including panendothelial, panvascular, and subpopulation-specific marker gene sets. Beyond the broad cellular categories of lymphatic, capillary, arterial, and venous ECs, we found previously indistinguishable subpopulations; among venous EC, we identified 2 previously indistinguishable populations: pulmonary–venous ECs (COL15A1(neg)) localized to the lung parenchyma and systemic–venous ECs (COL15A1(pos)) localized to the airways and the visceral pleura; among capillary ECs, we confirmed their subclassification into recently discovered aerocytes characterized by EDNRB, SOSTDC1, and TBX2 and general capillary EC. We confirmed that all 6 endothelial cell types, including the systemic–venous ECs and aerocytes, are present in mice and identified endothelial marker genes conserved in humans and mice. Ligand-receptor connectome analysis revealed important homeostatic crosstalk of EC with other lung resident cell types. scRNAseq of commercially available primary lung ECs demonstrated a loss of their native lung phenotype in culture. scRNAseq revealed that endothelial diversity is maintained in pulmonary hypertension. Our article is accompanied by an online data mining tool (www.LungEndothelialCellAtlas.com).

This protein acts both as a Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid scramblase and a Ca(2+)-activated ion channel but several studies have reported conflicting results about the ion selectivity of the TMEM16F-mediated current. Here, we have performed a detailed side-by-side comparison of the ion selectivity of TMEM16F using the whole-cell and inside-out excised patch configurations to directly compare the results. In inside-out configuration, Ca(2+)-dependent activation was fast and the TMEM16F-mediated current was activated in a few milliseconds, while in whole-cell recordings full activation required several minutes. We determined the relative permeability between Na(+) and Cl¯ (P(Na)/P(Cl)) using the dilution method in both configurations. The TMEM16F-mediated current was highly nonselective, but there were differences depending on the configuration of the recordings. In whole-cell recordings, P(Na)/P(Cl) was approximately 0.5, indicating a slight preference for Cl¯ permeation. In contrast, in inside-out experiments the TMEM16F channel showed a higher permeability for Na(+) with P(Na)/P(Cl) reaching 3.7. Our results demonstrate that the time dependence of Ca(2+) activation and the ion selectivity of TMEM16F depend on the recording configuration.","Stabilini, Stefano; Menini, Anna; Pifferi, Simone",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8395294/,352

In this study, 30 MR images from patients diagnosed with HCC is used to evaluate the robustness of semi-automatic segmentation using the flood fill algorithm for quantitative features extraction. The relevant features were extracted from the segmented MR images of HCC. Four types of features extraction were used for this study, which are tumour intensity, shape feature, textural feature and wavelet feature. A total of 662 radiomic features were extracted from manual and semi-automatic segmentation and compared using intra-class relation coefficient (ICC). Radiomic features extracted using semi-automatic segmentation utilized flood filling algorithm from 3D-slicer had significantly higher reproducibility (average ICC = 0.952 ± 0.009, p < 0.05) compared with features extracted from manual segmentation (average ICC = 0.897 ± 0.011, p > 0.05). Moreover, features extracted from semi-automatic segmentation were more robust compared to manual segmentation. This study shows that semi-automatic segmentation from 3D-Slicer is a better alternative to the manual segmentation, as they can produce more robust and reproducible radiomic features.","Haniff, Nurin Syazwina Mohd; Abdul Karim, Muhammad Khalis; Osman, Nurul Huda; Saripan, M Iqbal; Che Isa, Iza Nurzawani; Ibahim, Mohammad Johari",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8468357/,352

HCV vaccine development has faltered largely because the extreme diversity of the virus limits the protective breadth of vaccine elicited antibodies. It is believed that the principle neutralizing epitope in natural infection, HVR1, which is the most variable epitope in HCV, mediates humoral immune escape. So far, efforts to circumvent HVR1 interference in the induction and function of conserved targeting Ab have failed. Efforts to understand factors contributing to cross-neutralization of HVR1 variants have also been limited. Here, following mouse immunizations with two patient-derived HVR1 peptides, we observe cross-genotype neutralization of variants differing at 15/21 positions. Surprisingly, sequence similarity was not associated with cross-neutralization. It appeared neutralization sensitivity was an intrinsic feature of each variant, rather than emergent from the immunogen specific Ab response.

56101,Exploring Factors Influencing Farmers’ Continuance Intention to Crop Residue Retention: Evidence from Rural China,2021-07-11,"The country's population is increasing rapidly and the need to make lives easier daily. Some of the essential needs for this generation are crude oil and electricity. India, unfortunately, does not possess any oil reserves to meet the needs of the country’s demands. So, India is importing oil from other countries. Whenever there are situations like war, pandemic (COVID-19), and other emergencies, the natural oil reserved countries cannot export the oil to other countries which will lead to great chaos in the country. To avoid this situation storing the crude oil is necessary. Building surface giant structures for storing the oil is difficult and won’t be economical. So, India is constructing giant underground structures called caverns, which will reserve the oil. The present study is focused on the stability of the underground cavern structure and understanding the importance of the water-curtaining system. To analyse the stresses and displacement 2D modelling has been done. In this, wet and dry models are prepared and analysed based on the available geological and geotechnical data to determine the stresses around the cavern and the displacement which will reach the surface due to excavation.","Chimmani, K.

56104,The Relationship between Individual and Family Characteristics and Cyberbullying Exposure in a Nationally Representative Sample of School-Aged Children Living in Serbia,2021-07-12,"Studies have reported that anxiety had a positive effect on depression among substance abusers in males. However, little is known about the mechanism underlying this relationship in substance abusers in males. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mediating effect of loneliness and drug craving between anxiety and depression in substance abusers in males. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, The UCLA Loneliness Scale, Drug Craving Scale, and The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale were employed into this study to investigate 585 substance abusers in males (age range of 20–58 years: M = 33.21, SD = 6.97). Structural equation modeling and the bootstrap approach were used to analyze the mediating effect of loneliness and drug craving on the relationship between anxiety and depression. The results indicated that: Loneliness had a significant positive correlation with anxiety (r = 0.37, p < 0.001) and depression (r = 0.49, p < 0.001); Drug craving had a significant positive correlation with anxiety (r = 0.28, p < 0.001) and depression (r = 0.39, p < 0.001). Loneliness and drug craving mediated the link between anxiety and depression. There was a significant positive correlation between substance abusers in male’s anxiety, loneliness, drug craving, and depression. Loneliness and drug craving had a significant mediating effect on the relationship between anxiety and depression. Therefore, it was suggested that substance abusers in male’s anxiety and depression might be improved and driven by decreasing loneliness and drug craving. Targeted interventions to decrease substance abusers in male’s loneliness and drug craving should be developed, implemented, and help them to recover.","Chen, Xin; Qiu, Nan; Zhai, Liang; Ren, Gui",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294453/,352

Incidental radiation exposure to surrounding tissue during breast cancer treatment has been known to cause myocardial damage, the extent of which can be detected with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion studies. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the impact of RT on myocardial perfusion. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify 17 studies, of which 4 were included in this meta-analysis and 13 were included in the narrative synthesis. RESULTS The incidence of post-radiation cardiac perfusion defects on SPECT was significantly higher in patients who received RT for left-sided breast cancer compared to those who had RT for right-sided breast cancer (OR=3.10, 95% CI 1.35-7.08, p=0.007). CONCLUSION In patients who undergo RT for left-sided breast cancer, the incidence of post-radiation cardiac perfusion defects on SPECT is higher compared to patients who undergo RT for right-sided breast cancer.","Pak, Stella; Hawash, Ahmed A; Linares, Juan; Valencia, Damian; Kilgore, Andrew; Valencia, Victor; Markovic, John-Philip",Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30358193/,352

We found that protein synthesis inhibition by cycloheximide (CHX) blocked IFN alpha-mRNA expression, except when PBMC were preincubated with a conditioned medium as a potential source of cytokines. These data indicate that IFN alpha-mRNA induction by TGEV requires de novo synthesis of proteins. Moreover, they suggest that IFN alpha-mRNA induction in porcine leukocytes by TGEV involves mechanisms identical to those described for the herpes simplex virus in humans. In addition, experiments performed with a TGEV mutant, dm 49-4, previously characterized for its low ability to induce IFN alpha, showed that addition of a conditioned medium could not normalize its IFN alpha-inducing ability. Therefore, the defect of the dm49-4 mutant may be at the level of the final triggering signal to PBMC.","Charley, B; Lavenant, L; Lefèvre, F",Veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8142954/,352
200730,Discovering Correlations between the COVID-19 Epidemic Spread and Climate,2020,"The present studies explored whether faecal retention in the colon is a causative factor in functional bowel disease, appendicitis, and haemorrhoids. Faecal retention was characterized by colon transit time (CTT) after radio-opaque marker ingestion and estimation of faecal loading on abdominal radiographs at 48 h and 96 h. Specific hypotheses were tested in patients (n = 251 plus 281) and in healthy random controls (n = 44). A questionnaire was completed for each patient, covering abdominal and anorectal symptoms and without a priori grouping. Patients with functional bowel disorders, predominantly women, had a significantly increased CTT and faecal load compared to controls. The CTT was significantly and positively correlated with segmental and total faecal loading. The faecal load was equal at 48 h and 96 h, mirroring the presence of permanent faecal reservoirs. In these first clinical studies to correlate bowel symptoms with CTT and colon faecal loading, abdominal bloating was significantly correlated with faecal loading in the right colon, total faecal load, and CTT. Abdominal pain was significantly and positively correlated to distal faecal loading and significantly associated with bloating. A new phenomenon with a high faecal load and a normal CTT was observed in a subset of patients (n = 90), proving faecal retention as hidden constipation. The CTT and faecal load were significantly higher in the right-side compared to the left and distal segments. Within the control group of healthy persons, the right-sided faecal load was significantly greater than the left and distal load. The CTT and faecal load significantly positively correlated with a palpable mass in the left iliac fossa and meteorism. Cluster analysis revealed that CTT and faecal load positively correlated with a symptom factor consisting of bloating, proctalgia and infrequent defecation of solid faeces. On the other hand, CTT and faecal load negatively correlated with a symptom factor comprising frequent easy defecations, repetitiveness, and incompleteness with solid or liquid faeces. The majority of patients with a heavy faecal load but normal CTT had repetitive daily defecation, mostly with ease and with altering faecal consistence. Flue-like episodes co-existed in symptom factors with abdominal pain and meteorism, and these symptoms together with a palpable right iliac fossa mass and tenderness, and in other factors with seldom and difficult defecation, and with epigastric discomfort and halitosis. Patients with seldom and difficult defecation of solid faeces experienced abdominal pain significantly more often and presented a palpable mass in the right iliac fossa with tenderness and meteorism. The CTT was significantly prolonged and faecal load significantly increased. In patients with a normal CTT and increased faecal load, only patients with abdominal pain had a significant correlation between faecal loading and bloating. CTT and faecal load were shown for the first time to increase significantly with the number of colonic redundancies (colon length), which also resulted in significantly increased bloating and pain. Intervention with a bowel stimulation regimen combining a fibre-rich diet, fluid, physical activity, and a prokinetic drug was essential to proving that abdominal symptoms and defecation disorders are caused by faecal retention, with or without a prolonged CTT. The CTT was significantly reduced, as was faecal load. Bloating and pain were reduced significantly. The defecation became easy with solid faeces, towards one per day and with significant reductions in incompleteness and repetitiveness. Proctalgia and flue-like episodes were significantly reduced. The intervention significantly reduced the presence of a tender palpable mass in the right fossa and rectal constipation. In patients with a normal CTT but increased faecal load, the intervention did not significantly change the CTT or load, but bloating and pain were significantly reduced, just as defecation improved overall. The novel knowledge of faecal retention in the patients does not explain why faecal retention occurs. However, it may be inferred from the present results that a constipated or irritable bowel may belong to the same underlying disease dimension, where faecal retention is a common factor. Thus, measuring CTT and faecal load is suggested as a guide to a positive functional diagnosis of bowel disorders compared to the constellation of symptoms alone. Thirty-five patients underwent surgery after being refractory to the conservative treatment for constipation. They had a significantly prolonged CTT and heavy faecal loading, which was responsible for the aggravated abdominal and defaecatory symptoms. The operated patients presented with a redundant colon (dolichocolon) significantly more often. These patients also had an extremely high rate of previous appendectomy. Twenty-one patients underwent hemicolectomy, and 11 patients had a subtotal colectomy with an ileosigmoidal anastomosis; three patients received a stoma. However, some patients had to have the initial segmental colectomy converted to a final subtotal colectomy because of persisting symptoms. Six more subtotal colectomies have been performed and the leakage rate of all colectomies is then 4.9 % (one patient died). After a mean follow-up of 5 years, the vast majority of patients were without abdominal pain and bloating, having two to four defecations daily with control and their quality of life had increased considerably. A faecalith is often located in the appendix, the occlusion of which is responsible for many cases of acute appendicitis, which is infrequent in all except white populations. An effort to trace the origin of the faecalith to faecal retention in the colon was made in a case control study (56 patients and 44 random controls). The CTT was longer and faecal load greater in patients with appendicitis compared to controls, though the difference was not significant. Power calculations showed that more patients were needed to reach statistical significance for these parameters. The presence of a faecalith was most often associated with a gangrenous or perforated appendix. No significant differences were found between the CTT and faecal load of patients who had or did not have a faecalith. However, the right-sided faecal load was significantly higher than the left and distal load. Haemorrhoids are often a consequence of constipation and defaecatory disorders and were found in every second patient with functional bowel disorders. The present studies are the first Danish reports of a novel operation to cure this disease, stapled haemorrhoidopexy (n = 40 and 258 patients). The majority of patients had prolapsed haemorrhoids, and the durability of procedure was confirmed with a follow-up of up to 5 years, meaning a normal anus. The operation time was short, post-operative pain was low, and recovery was rapid. No incontinence was observed, and patient satisfaction was high and significantly correlated with the appearance of a normal anus without prolapse. The cumulative risk of re-operation was greatest in the first 2 years after the stapled haemorrhoidopexy. Patients with persisting haemorrhoidal prolapse had the procedure repeated with results as good as those obtained in the rest of the patients. It was shown in a statistical model that the preoperative severity of haemorrhoidal disease and the immediate postoperative result contributed significantly to predicting the outcome that is the durability of the operation. The most frequent post-operative complication was bleeding requiring surgical haemostasis. One serious complication occurred after an anastomotic leak from a highly placed anastomosis, resulting in retro rectal, retro- and intra-peritoneal, and mediastinal gas. The patient recovered after conservative treatment and without surgical intervention. The stapling technique now used has revolutionized the surgical treatment of prolapsing haemorrhoids. Finally, a common cause may be suspected for diseases constantly associated with one another. Epidemiological evidence has recognized that constipation, diverticulosis and IBS increase the risk of colon cancer (and adenomas), diseases exceedingly rare in communities exempt from appendicitis. Haemorrhoids are a colonic co-morbidity as well. Notably, the patients with a functional bowel disorder had a much higher rate of a previous appendectomy than the background population. In addition, the patients who had previously had an appendectomy had a significantly longer CTT compared to patients, who had not. The data points to the involvement of faecal retention in the origin of faecaliths and, thus, acute appendicitis. Faecal reservoirs were shown in the right and left colon segments in both patients and controls, which are the same areas bearing the highest incidences of adenomateous polyps and malignancies. Familial colorectal cancer occurred significantly more often in patients who had a higher faecal load than the controls. Four malignancies and 25 adenomas were identified. An increased faecal load in the colon with or without delayed transit will increase bacterial counts and create a chronic inflammation of the colonic mucosa, which is a risk factor for cancer onset. A functional bowel disorder is then likely to occur with gradually transition from a primary functional disease into specific organic diseases. A diet rich in fibre and regular physical activity have a therapeutic and preventive effect on colorectal diseases associated with faecal retention. A “common cause” was earlier proposed for constipation, colon diverticula, cancer, appendicitis, and haemorrhoids. The actual results of the present studies support this unifying theory for these diet-related diseases, in which the functional retention of faeces maybe the common cause.","Raahave, Dennis",Danish medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25748875/,352

Technically in detecting SLN; radioactive substance, dyers or both are used. During the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, delayed images were not taken in lymphoscintigraphy to reduce the risk of transmission by shortening the waiting time in our center. In this study, the effects of early and delayed lymphoscintigraphic images and only early images on our clinical practice were evaluated. METHODS: We investigated the data of 147 patients in this study who underwent SLNB due to early-stage breast cancer at our institute during the COVID-19 pandemic period (PP) (March/April/May 2020) and within 3 months before the pandemic were evaluated. RESULTS: Patients were divided into two groups, before pandemic (BP) and PP. BP consisted of patients whose early and delayed images were taken in lymphoscintigraphy whereas PP consisted of those with early images only. There were 74 patients in the BP group and 73 patients in the PP group. Early phase increased uptake was not observed in 23 patients, and increased uptake was obtained from 22 of these patients with delayed imaging in BP period. In PP, increased uptake was not observed in 12 patients. SLN was not detected in 2 patients in the BP group and 7 in the PP group. It was found that the sensitivity, NPV and accuracy of the SLNB procedure performed after taking delayed images was higher. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we believe that if technically possible, delayed images taken during the lymphoscintigraphy can assist the surgeon in terms of SLN detection and the number of SLNs removed.","Yüksel, Cemil; Çulcu, Serdar; Dogan, Lütfi",J Invest Surg,,352

212902,Refugees in Canada during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The new coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), turned into a pandemic affecting more than 200 countries. Due to the high rate of transmission and mortality, finding specific and effective treatment options for this infection is currently of urgent importance. Emerging technologies have created a promising platform for developing novel treatment options for various viral diseases such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here, we have described potential novel therapeutic options based on the structure and pathophysiological mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as the results of previous studies on similar viruses such as SARS and MERS. Many of these approaches can be used for controlling viral infection by reducing the viral damage or by increasing the potency of the host response. Owing to their high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility, siRNAs, aptamers, nanobodies, neutralizing antibodies, and different types of peptides can be used for interference with viral replication or for blocking internalization. Receptor agonists and interferon-inducing agents are also potential options to balance and enhance the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Solid evidence on the efficacy and safety of such novel technologies is yet to be established although many well-designed clinical trials are underway to address these issues.","Aghamollaei, Hossein; Sarvestani, Rahim; Bakherad, Hamid; Zare, Hamed; Guest, Paul C; Ranjbar, Reza; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Adv Exp Med Biol,,352

There is as yet insufficient information about the effects of HSCT on the clinical course of COVID-19. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the clinical course of COVID-19 in patients who had undergone HSCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed baseline characteristics, clinical course and findings of COVID-19, hospitalization and death rates, overall survival and case fatality rates of HSCT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 retrospectively. RESULTS: 57.6% of the patients underwent AHSCT, and 42.4% underwent allo-HSCT. 60.6%, 27.3%, and 12.1% of the patients had mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 or critical illness, respectively. 45.5% were hospitalized, and 12.1% required intensive care. 9.1% necessitated invasive mechanical ventilation. The total CFR was 9.1% in HSCT recipients, 22.2% in patients with active hematologic malignancy and 4.2% in patients without active hematologic malignancy. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that mortality of HSCT recipients is lower in patients whose primary disease is in remission compared to ones that are not in remission. Further studies with larger group patients are needed in order to delineate the effects of COVID-19 on HSCT patients.","Karatas, Ayse; Malkan, Ümit Yavuz; Velet, Mustafa; Demiroglu, Haluk; Büyükasik, Yahya; Telli Dizman, Gülçin; Inkaya, Ahmet Çagkan; Erdogdu, Batuhan; Çinar, Olgu Erkin; Aladag Karakulak, Elifcan; Aksu, Salih; Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim Celalettin; Özcebe, Osman Ilhami; Sayinalp, Nilgün; Göker, Hakan",Turkish journal of medical sciences,,352

A Study during the First Three Days of the COVID-19 Quarantine in Spain,2020,"BACKGROUND: The use of social big data is an important emerging concern in the public health. Internet search volume is a useful data that can sensitively detect trends of public's attention in a situation of a pandemic outbreak. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to identify the interest and correlation between the proliferation of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), interest in immunity and products that have been discussed to confer an enhancement of immunity, while suggesting the measures of intervention to be undertaken from a health and medical point of view. METHODS: To assess the level of public interest in infectious disease during the initial days of the outbreak of COVID-19, we extracted Google search data from the past year based on the date of 15th of March 2020, which is approximately two months after the COVID-19 outbreak. In order to determine whether the public became interested in the immune system, we selected 'coronavirus', 'immune', 'vitamin' as our final search term. RESULTS: The increase in cumulative confirmed cases of coronavirus after January 20 had a strong positive correlation with search volumes for the terms 'coronavirus' (R = 0.786, P < .0001), 'immune' (R = 0.745, P < .0001) and 'vitamin' (R = 0.778, P < .0001), and the variables were all mutually statistically significant. Moreover, these correlations were confirmed on a country-basis when we restricted analyses to the US, the UK, Italy, and Korea. Our findings revealed that increases in search volumes for 'coronavirus' and 'immune' preceded the actual occurrences of confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study implicates that during the initial phase of the COVID-19 crisis, the public's desire and actions to strengthen their own immune systems were enhanced. Further, in the early stage of a pandemic there is a high potential of social media to inform the public about potentially helpful measures to prevent the spread of an infectious disease and provide relevant information about immunity and thereby increase the knowledge.","Lee, Jinhee; Kwan, Yunna; Lee, Jun Young; Shin, Jae Il; Lee, Keum Hwa; Hong, Sung Hwi; Han, Young Joo; Kronbichler, Andreas; Smith, Lee; Koyanagi, Ai; Jacob, Louis; Choi, SungWon; Ghayda, Ramy Abou; Park, Myung-Bae",J. med. internet res,,352
216140,Consumption of over-the-Counter Drugs: Prevalence and Type of Drugs,2021,"There remains an urgent need to identify existing drugs that might be suitable for treating patients suffering from COVID-19 infection. Drugs rarely act at a single molecular target, with off target effects often being responsible for undesirable side effects and sometimes, beneficial synergy between targets for a specific illness. Off target activities have also led to blockbuster drugs in some cases, e.g. Viagra for erectile dysfunction and Minoxidil for male pattern hair loss. Drugs already in use or in clinical trials plus approved natural products constitute a rich resource for discovery of therapeutic agents that can be repurposed for existing and new conditions, based on the rationale that they have already been assessed for safety in man. A key question then is how to rapidly and efficiently screen such compounds for activity against new pandemic pathogens such as COVID-19. Here we show how a fast and robust computational process can be used to screen large libraries of drugs and natural compounds to identify those that may inhibit the main protease of SARS-Cov-2 (3CL pro, Mpro). We show how the resulting shortlist of candidates with strongest binding affinities is highly enriched in compounds that have been independently identified as potential antivirals against COVID-19. The top candidates also include a substantial number of drugs and natural products not previously identified as having potential COVID-19 activity, thereby providing additional targets for experimental validation. This in silico screening pipeline may also be useful for repurposing of existing drugs and discovery of new drug candidates against other medically important pathogens and for use in future pandemics.","Piplani, Sakshi; Singh, Puneet; Petrovsky, Nikolai; Winkler, David A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00744v1.pdf,352

Tongue features should be referred for diagnosis and treatment of diseases in TCM. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the tongue features of the patients suffered from COVID-19. Methods: COVID-19 Symptom Database (established by Evidence-based Medicine Center of Tianjin University of TCM) was searched for eligible tongue pictures. The tongue pictures were assessed by TCM experts to extract the data of tongue color, coating color, tongue body shape and coating proper feature. The relationship between tongue features and patient's condition was analyzed. Results: Patients diagnosed as mild and moderate COVID-19 commonly had light red tongue and white coating. Severe patients had purple tongue and yellow coating. The proportion of critical patients with tender tongue increased to 75%. Greasy coating was a significant characteristic of patients with COVID-19. The proportions of greasy coating were 53.33%, 73.30%, 83.67 and 87.5% in disease category of mild, moderate, severe and critical. In addition, the thick coating proportion increased from mild (24.89%) to critical (50.00%). Conclusions: Tongue features have certain relationship with the category of COVID-19. Tongue features can serve as potential indicators for the evaluation of patient's condition and prognosis. Further studies are needed to enhance the quantification of tongue features and develop standards.","Pang, Wentai; Zhang, Dong; Zhang, Junhua; Li, Nan; Zheng, Wenke; Wang, Hui; Liu, Chunxiang; Yang, Fengwen; Pang, Bo",Integr.

218108,Burnout in Spanish Security Forces during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"With surging global demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity, laboratories seek automated, high-throughput molecular solutions, particularly for specimens not requiring specialized collection devices or viral transport media. Saliva specimens submitted from patients under investigation for COVID-19 from March to July 2020 were processed in the laboratory with sterile phosphate-buffered saline in a 1:2 dilution and tested using manual extraction and a commercial assay for detection of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene (LightMix®) in comparison to the Roche cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test on the cobas® 6800 instrument. 34.4% (22/64) of saliva samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Positive and negative concordance between the LightMix® and cobas® assays were 100%. The overall invalid rate for saliva on the cobas® 6800 (1/128, 0.78%) was similar to the baseline invalid rate observed for nasopharyngeal swabs/viral transport media. Saliva is a feasible specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 testing on the cobas® 6800 platform, with potential to improve turnaround time and enhance testing capacity.","Matic, Nancy; Lawson, Tanya; Ritchie, Gordon; Stefanovic, Aleksandra; Leung, Victor; Champagne, Sylvie; Romney, Marc G; Lowe, Christopher F",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,,352

The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, psychosomatic conditions, interpersonal relationships and social support, COVID-19 infection-related psychological stress, and mental health status were measured. Medical conditions were extracted from patients' electronic healthcare records. Among the 6213 cancer patients, 23.4% had depression, 17.7% had anxiety, 9.3% had PTSD, and 13.5% had hostility. Hierarchical liner regression models showed that having a history of mental disorder, excessive alcohol consumption, having a higher frequency of worrying about cancer management due to COVID-19, having a higher frequency feeling of overwhelming psychological pressure from COVID-19, and having a higher level of fatigue and pain were the predominant risk factors for mental health problems in cancer patients. However, there were only 1.6% of them were seeking psychological counseling during COVID-19. We also revealed the protective factors associated with lower risk of mental health problems among cancer patients. The present study revealed a high prevalence of mental health problems and gaps in mental health services for cancer patients, which also indicated high distress from COVID-19-elevated risks.

In our preliminary field trapping experiment, both female and male N. asiatica adults were captured by male-produced sex attractant. To provide a solid background for studying mechanism of olfaction, the sensilla of antenna and maxillary palp of N. asiatica adults were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy. Both sexes have 3 antennal segments, including scape, pedicel, and flagellum, while arista is arisen from the proximal dorsal ridge of the flagellum. Two types of sensilla were found on the scape and pedicel, sensilla microtrichia (AnMi) and sensilla chaetica (AnCh). There are five types of sensilla on the flagellum, sensilla basiconica (AnB), clavate sensilla (AnCl), sensilla trichoidea (AnTr), sensilla coeloconica (AnCo), and AnMi. Three types of sensilla were observed on maxillary palp, sensilla basiconica (MpB), sensilla microtrichia (MpMi), and sensilla chaetica (MpCh). AnMi and MpMi are the most abundant sensilla type on antenna and maxillary palp, respectively. With the exception of having longer flagellum in females, the dimension of antennal segments, type and number of sensilla, density of pores on the shaft of AnCl, AnCh, AnB and MpB, and at the base area of AnCh and MpCh didn't show differences between sexes.

222512,Low COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance Is Correlated with Conspiracy Beliefs among University Students in Jordan,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Human milk cannot currently be considered a major source of COVID-19 infection. On the other hand, it can contain specific antibodies that could modulate a possible newborn infection by SARS-CoV-2. MAIN ISSUE: A 32-year-old pregnant woman, gestational age 37 and 3/7 weeks, was admitted with a flu-like syndrome caused by COVID-19. The female newborn was appropriate for gestational age, with a birth weight of 2,890 g, length 48 cm, and head circumference 34 cm. MANAGEMENT: The mother-infant dyad remained in the rooming-in unit during hospitalization, exclusively breastfeeding and following World Health Organization recommendations for contact and airway precautions. On the 3rd day after delivery, two mother's milk samples (3 and 5 mL) were collected by hand expression. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min twice consecutively to separate fat, which was removed, and the remaining material was transferred to another tube to determine anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin A and Immunoglobulin G (ELISA, Kit EUROIMMUN AG, Luebeck, Germany). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin A was detected in the two samples evaluated, whose values were 2.5 and 1.9, respectively. No anti-SARSCoV-2 immunoglobulin G was detected. The exclusively-breastfed infant remained well through 45 days of age. CONCLUSION: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin A in the milk of mothers infected with COVID-19 may be related to protection against the transmission and severity of the disease in their infants.","Lebrão, Cibele Wolf; Cruz, Manuela Navarro; Silva, Mariliza Henrique da; Dutra, Letícia Veríssimo; Cristiani, Camila; Affonso Fonseca, Fernando Luiz; Suano-Souza, Fabíola Isabel",J Hum Lact,,352

223770,Can Optimum Solar Radiation Exposure or Supplemented Vitamin D Intake Reduce the Severity of COVID-19 Symptoms?,2021,"OBJECTIVES: An ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 is spreading globally. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is the most common complication of coronavirus disease 2019. However, the clinical effectiveness of early high-flow nasal oxygen treatment in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure has not been explored. This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of high-flow nasal oxygen treatment and to identify the variables predicting high-flow nasal oxygen treatment failure in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. DESIGN: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Three tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, China. PATIENTS: Forty-three confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure treated with high-flow nasal oxygen. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean age of the enrolled patients was 63.0 ± 9.7 years; female patients accounted for 41.9%. High-flow nasal oxygen failure (defined as upgrading respiratory support to positive pressure ventilation or death) was observed in 20 patients (46.5%), of which 13 (30.2%) required endotracheal intubation. Patients with high-flow nasal oxygen success had a higher median oxygen saturation (96.0% vs 93.0%; p < 0.001) at admission than those with high-flow nasal oxygen failure. High-flow nasal oxygen failure was more likely in patients who were older (p = 0.030) and male (p = 0.037), had a significant increase in respiratory rate and a significant decrease in the ratio of oxygen saturation/FIO2 to respiratory rate index within 3 days of high-flow nasal oxygen treatment. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis model, male and lower oxygen saturation at admission remained independent predictors of high-flow nasal oxygen failure. The hospital mortality rate of the cohort was 32.5%; however, the hospital mortality rate in patients with high-flow nasal oxygen failure was 65%. CONCLUSIONS: High-flow nasal oxygen may be effective for treating coronavirus disease 2019 patients with mild to moderate acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. However, high-flow nasal oxygen failure was associated with a poor prognosis. Male and lower oxygenation at admission were the two strong predictors of high-flow nasal oxygen failure.","Xia, Jingen; Zhang, Yi; Ni, Lan; Chen, Lei; Zhou, Changzhi; Gao, Chang; Wu, Xiaojing; Duan, Jun; Xie, Jungang; Guo, Qiang; Zhao, Jianping; Hu, Yi; Cheng, Zhenshun; Zhan, Qingyuan",Crit Care Med,,352

METHODS: Open-access data and press releases on COVID-19 in Taiwan were collected on the website of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. All 55 community-acquired cases of COVID-19 confirmed from January 28 to April 12, 2020, in Taiwan were included. Basic demographic characteristics, symptom presentation, infection source, route of identification, and transmission dynamics were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 55 cases, 52.7% were female and 74.5% were between 20-59 years of age. One-sixth (16.4%) of community-acquired cases were asymptomatic. More than half (58.2%) of the cases were identified via contact tracing. The median incubation period was 6 days (range 1-13 d) and the median serial interval was 4 days (range -3-24 d). Twenty-six cases (47.3%) were transmitted from presymptomatic cases, 11 cases (20%) from symptomatic cases, and 2 cases (3.6%) from an asymptomatic case. The contagious period of symptomatic cases was from 7 days before to 15 days after the onset of symptoms. CONCLUSION: The high proportion of asymptomatic cases and the transmissibility in the presymptomatic and asymptomatic periods make control of COVID-19 challenging. Protective measures such as social distancing, wearing face masks, and hand washing are mandatory to prevent community transmission.","Liu, Jui-Yao; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Hwang, Shinn-Jang",J Chin Med Assoc,,352
224704,The Use of Penalized Regression Analysis to Identify County-Level Demographic and Socioeconomic Variables Predictive of Increased COVID-19 Cumulative Case Rates in the State of Georgia,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since its initial description in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly progressed into a worldwide pandemic, which has affected millions of lives. Unlike the disease in adults, the vast majority of children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms and are largely spared from severe respiratory disease. However, thereare children who have significant respiratory disease, and some may develop a hyperinflammatory response similar to thatseen in adults with COVID-19 and in children with Kawasaki disease (KD), which has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report was to examine the current evidence that supports the etiopathogenesis of COVID-19 in children and the relationship of COVID-19 with KD and MIS-C as a basis for a better understanding of the clinical course, diagnosis, and management of these clinically perplexing conditions. RESULTS: The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is carried out in two distinct but overlapping phases of COVID-19: the first triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) itself and the second by the host immune response. Children with KD have fewer of the previously described COVID-19-associated KD features with less prominent acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock than children with MIS-C. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 in adults usually includes severe respiratory symptoms and pathology, with a high mortality. Ithas become apparent that children are infected as easily as adults but are more often asymptomatic and have milder diseasebecause of their immature immune systems. Although children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they canpresent with a SARS-CoV-2-associated MIS-C similar to KD.","Frenkel, Lawrence; Gomez, Fernando; Bellanti, Joseph A",Allergy asthma proc,,352

To answer the first question, we propose a tool for estimating the reproduction number of epidemic (the number of secondary infections $R_t$) based on the SEIR model and compare it with an non-model $R_t$ estimation. To measure the $R_t$ of COVID-19 for different countries, real-time data on coronavirus daily cases of infections, recoveries, deaths are retrieved from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. To assess the effectiveness of mobility restrictions for the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the correlations between the $R_t$ and people's mobility (based on the Apple mobility index) are presented. The correlations were considered for 12 countries and for most of them, the correlations are negative. This shows a delay in the implementation of mobility restrictions - the countries imposed them in response to growth of new COVID-19 cases, rather than preventively.","Petrova, Tatiana; Soshnikov, Dmitri; Grunin, Andrey",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12222v1.pdf,352

This study of a large multinational organization with a strong Triple Bottom Line focus provides a comprehensive analysis of the use of control and governance mechanisms in supply chain context. Through the Levers of Control framework, the application of these mechanisms both internally and across organizational boundaries is shown. The interplay between levers helps in dealing with the in itself paradoxical nature of Triple Bottom Line goalsetting. The results show that the ""softer"" elements of the Triple Bottom Line, i.e., People and Planet, are approached with the lever associated with the beliefs system, which in turn enforces the boundary and interactive control systems. Ultimately, applying the Levers of Control in supply chain context might contribute to pursuing a holistic approach of sustainable supply chain management.","de Haan-Hoek, Joost; Lambrechts, Wim; Semeijn, Janjaap; Caniëls, Marjolein C.J.",Sustainability,,352

In the meantime, in the US and in Europe, HE has recently focused on participatory curriculum development (PCD) and programs that seek to directly connect student learning to “real-world” problems, accelerating positive change in curricula and through their contributions to regional communities. Accepted into the Bologna Process—the standardization of European HE—Armenian HE institutions struggle to satisfy requirements and related sustainable development goals with centralized standards, inhibiting them from being internationally competitive and regional sustainability change agents. In this article, we examine post-Soviet HE development since 1991 and challenges, with a particular focus on Armenia;what participatory curriculum building may offer;and how it contributes to HE and regional sustainability transitions. A systematic literature review was applied, using specific combinations of important terms restricting the search with criteria such as language, year of publication, and descriptive or critical in nature. The results illustrate the status quo of post-Soviet HE, synthesize current barriers of HE as potential change agents, and highlight PCD as a way to overcome these barriers.","Hovakimyan, Hasmik Klimek Milena Freyer Bernhard Hayrapetyan Ruben",Sustainability,,352

The model has been used to predict the death rate in Spain but can be used to predict the demand of ICUs or mechanical ventilators under different restraint policies. The main novelty of the model is that it keeps track of the date of infection of a single individual and uses stochastic distributions to aggregate individuals who share the same date of infection. In addition, it uses two types of infections, mild and serious, with a different recovery time. These features are implemented in a set of differential equations which determine the number of Carriers, Infections, Recoveries, Hospitalized and Deaths. Comparison with real data shows good agreement.","Benavides, Efren M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13890v2.pdf,352

Thus the prediction of the future trend of the disease in different countries can be useful for managing the outbreak. Several data driven works have been done for the prediction of COVID-19 cases and these data uses features of past data for future prediction. In this study the machine learning (ML)-guided linear regression model has been used to address the different types of COVID-19 related issues. The linear regression model has been fitted into the dataset to deal with the total number of positive cases, and the number of recoveries for different states in India such as Maharashtra, West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi and Assam. From the current analysis of COVID-19 data it has been observed that trend of per day number of infection follows linearly and then increases exponentially. This property has been incorporated into our prediction and the piecewise linear regression is the best suited model to adopt this property. The experimental results shows the superiority of the proposed scheme and to the best of our knowledge this is a new approach towards the prediction of COVID-19.","Senapati, Apurbalal; Nag, Amitava; Mondal, Arunendu; Maji, Soumen",Int J Inf Technol,,352

This was based on a community-orientated primary care approach and was a key strategy in limiting the spread of the pandemic, but it struggled with long turnaround times (TATs) for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test. The local experience at Symphony Way Community Day Centre (Delft, Cape Town), highlighted these challenges. The first positive tests had a median TAT of 4.5 days, peaking at 29 days in mid-May 2020. Issues that contributed to long TATs were unavailability of viral transport medium, sample delivery and storage difficulties, staffing problems, scarcity of testing supplies and other samples prioritised over CST samples. At Symphony Way, many patients who tested COVID-19 positive had abandoned their self-isolation because of the delay in results. Employers were unhappy with prolonged sick leave whilst waiting for results and patients were concerned about not getting paid or job loss. The CST policy relies on a rapid TAT to be successful. Once the TAT is delayed, the process of contacting patients, and tracing and quarantining contacts becomes ineffective. With hindsight, other countries' difficulties in upscaling testing should have served as warning. Community screening and testing was scaled back from 18 May 2020, and testing policy was changed to only include high-risk patients from 29 May 2020. The delayed TATs meant that the CST policy had no beneficial impact at local level.","Porter, James D; Mash, Robert; Preiser, Wolfgang",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,,352

Despite the majority of patients will evolve asymptomatic or mild-moderate upper respiratory tract infections, 20% will develop severe disease. Based on current pathogenetic knowledge, a severe COVID-19 form is mainly a hyperinflammatory, immune-mediated disorder, triggered by a viral infection. Due to their particular immunological features, pregnant women are supposed to be particularly susceptible to complicate by intracellular infections as well as immunological disturbances. As an example, immune-thrombosis has been identified as a common immune-mediated and pathogenic phenomenon both in COVID-19, in obstetric diseases and in COVID-19 pregnant women. According to extensive published clinical data, is rationale to expect an interference with the normal development of pregnancy in selected SARS-CoV-2-infected cases, mainly during third trimester.This manuscript provides insights of research to elucidate the potential harmful responses to SARS-CoV-2 and /or other coronavirus infections, as well as bidirectional interactions between COVID-19 and pregnancy to improve their respective management.","Ferrer-Oliveras, Raquel; Mendoza, Manel; Capote, Sira; Pratcorona, Laia; Esteve-Valverde, Enrique; Cabero-Roura, Lluis; Alijotas-Reig, Jaume",Arch Gynecol Obstet,,352

This effect has been highlighted in higher brain areas, such as the prefrontal cortex, but has also been posited in basic sensory cortices. Based on this, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to investigate potential changes to GABA+ and glutamate+glutamine (Glx) concentrations within the occipital cortex in MDD patients (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 25). No difference in occipital GABA+ or Glx concentrations, nor in the GABA+/Glx ratio, was found between groups. An analysis of an extended MDD patient and unmatched control dataset (n = 90) found no correlation between metabolite concentrations and depressive symptoms. These results were integrated with prior studies through metabolite-specific meta-analyses, revealing no difference in occipital GABA and Glx concentrations between patients and controls. An effect of publication year on GABA group differences was found, suggesting that previously reported results may have been artifacts of measurement accuracy. Taken together, our results suggest that, contrary to some prior reports, MRS measurements of occipital GABA and Glx do not differ between MDD patients and controls.","Truong, Vuong; Cheng, Paul Z; Lee, Hsin-Chien; Lane, Timothy J; Hsu, Tzu-Yu; Duncan, Niall W",Psychiatry Res Neuroimaging,,352

Many commonly discussed medications being used to treat COVID-19 are not without potentially harmful side effects such as heart, liver, kidney problems, or other clinical symptoms. Acupuncture is a nonpharmacological method. When a needle is inserted into an acupuncture point, traumatic physical stimulation occurs, and then the neuroendocrine immune regulation network is activated. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture for improving the side effects of COVID-19 western medicine treatments. METHODS: From their inception to December 10, 2020, the following electronic databases will be searched to identify relevant studies: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), without any language restrictions. Randomized controlled trials and credible clinical observations without randomization include patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and receiving western medicine treatments or acupuncture, with no restrictions on disease stage, age, sex, or ethnicity. Primary outcomes would be used to evaluate the mortality rate, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine, troponin, liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase), blood pressure, clinical symptoms (including fever, fatigue, myalgia, cough, skin rash, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), and serum cytokine levels. Secondary outcome would be used to evaluate the adverse events of acupuncture. Risk of bias will be assessed by 2 review authors independently according to the guidelines set out in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. DISCUSSION: This is the first to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture for improving the side effects of COVID-19 western medicine treatments. A longer follow-up should be considered in future studies. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis would provide evidence of acupuncture specifically focused on its effectiveness and safety for patients with COVID-19 western medications adverse effects.

The sudden emergence of the viral pathogen responsible for this outbreak, the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has triggered alarm for their instant management using anti-viral measures and diagnostic tools. Early diagnosis will enable containment of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), allowing quick implementation of control measures for limiting the spread of this disease. Due to high human to human transmission, the development of effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics for treating affected patients will help to slow down the transfer ofviruses from patients to healthy individuals. However, till the time any effective therapeutic or vaccine is developed, preventing exposure to SARS- CoV-2 virus is the best way out. The development of more effective personal protective equipments (PPEs) is essential to maintain the safety of healthcare professionals and the public at large. Taking into consideration the current severity of this disease and the imperative need of SARS-CoV-2 specific treatment and diagnostic tools, nanotechnology-based approaches can provide promising alternatives to conventional ways of disease diagnosis, treatment, and preventing exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we inform about the different ways in which nanotechnology can help in the detection and treatment of prevailing SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as help to improve the PPE devices.","Jindal, S.; Gopinath, P.",Nano Express,,352

We find that democratic countries, countries with the higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, higher healthcare expenditures, and better universal healthcare coverage are less likely to deviate from the Newcomb-Benford law. The relationship holds for the cumulative number of deaths and for the cumulative number of total cases but is more pronounced for the death toll. The findings are robust for the second digit tests, for a sub-sample of countries with regional data, and during the previous swine flu (H1N1) 2009-2010 pandemic.","Balashov, Vadim S.; Yan, Yuxing; Zhu, Xiaodi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14841v1.pdf,352
246723,Effectiveness of Epidemic Preventive Policies and Hospital Strategies in Combating COVID-19 Outbreak in Taiwan,2021,"As a response to the pandemic caused by SARS-Cov-2 virus, on 15 March, 2020, the Republic of Serbia introduced comprehensive anti-epidemic measures to curb COVID-19. After a slowdown in the epidemic, on 6 May, 2020, the regulatory authorities decided to relax the implemented measures. However, the epidemiological situation soon worsened again. As of 7 February, 2021, a total of 406,352 cases of SARSCov-2 infection have been reported in Serbia, 4,112 deaths caused by COVID-19. In order to better understand the epidemic dynamics and predict possible outcomes, we have developed an adaptive mathematical model SEAIHRDS (S-susceptible, E-exposed, A-asymptomatic, I-infected, H-hospitalized, R-recovered, D-dead due to COVID-19 infection, S-susceptible). The model can be used to simulate various scenarios of the implemented intervention measures and calculate possible epidemic outcomes, including the necessary hospital capacities. Considering promising results regarding the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, the model is extended to simulate vaccination among different population strata. The findings from various simulation scenarios have shown that, with implementation of strict measures of contact reduction, it is possible to control COVID-19 and reduce number of deaths. The findings also show that limiting effective contacts within the most susceptible population strata merits a special attention. However, the findings also show that the disease has a potential to remain in the population for a long time, likely with a seasonal pattern. If a vaccine, with efficacy equal or higher than 65%, becomes available it could help to significantly slow down or completely stop circulation of the virus in human population. The effects of vaccination depend primarily on: 1. Efficacy of available vaccine(s), 2. Prioritization of the population categories for vaccination, and 3. Overall vaccination coverage of the population, assuming that the vaccine(s) develop solid immunity in vaccinated individuals. With expected basic reproduction number of Ro=2.46 and vaccine efficacy of 68%, an 87% coverage would be sufficient to stop the virus circulation.","Stanojevic, Slavoljub; Ponjavic, Mirza; Stanojevic, Slobodan; Stevanovic, Aleksandar; Radojicic, Sonja",Microb Risk Anal,,352
249620,The Outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic and its Social Impact on Education: Were Engineering Teachers Ready to Teach Online?,2021,"OBJECTIVE: In March 2020, the world experienced a global pandemic, which involved the shutdown of schools or a transposition to remote teaching in most countries. The objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic related lockdown on sleep patterns and sleep quality in adolescents and young adults. METHODS: An online survey was conducted in June 2020 with adolescents and young adults (n = 498) aged 12-25 years. Participants had to answer questions on sleep, first retrospectively, referring to the time prior to the pandemic, and then referring to the time during the pandemic. RESULTS: A pronounced shift towards later sleep combined with an increase in sleep duration was found during the pandemic. However, these changes in sleep habits were more pronounced in adolescents than in young adults and seem to occur mostly during weekdays compared to weekends. During the pandemic, teens also reported an improvement in daytime sleepiness and subjective sleep quality, while young adults reported an increase in sleep difficulties associated with sleep onset difficulties, nocturnal and early morning awakenings, and nightmares. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 related lockdown seems to have had a beneficial effect on sleep in adolescents. In young adults, benefits are not as obvious. These results support that later school start times would be beneficial for adolescents. However, in young adults it could be important to investigate the effects of other situational or interindividual factors (stress, lifestyle habits, employment, etc.).","Ramos Socarras, Laura; Potvin, Jérémie; Forest, Geneviève",Sleep Med,,352
250083,Perceived Threat of COVID-19 Contagion and Frontline Paramedics' Agonistic Behaviour: Employing a Stressor-Strain-Outcome Perspective,2020,"In this Invited Commentary, the author considers the February 2020 announcement that scoring on the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 will change to pass/fail no sooner than January 2022 and its effects on the transition to residency process in the context of both the recommendations of the Invitational Conference on USMLE Scoring (InCUS) held in March 2019 and the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020. The author suggests that the medical education community must embrace any positive changes that come about as a result of the pandemic while continuing to systematically review the strengths and areas for improvement in the current transition to residency process.In its recommendations, InCUS provided a thoughtful set of action priorities and an effective process to work together, which can inform and guide the work ahead. The COVID-19 pandemic is dominating the educational and clinical environments and is now the biggest disruptor in all aspects of life, not just medical education. It is the responsibility of leaders in medical education to have a vision for and then implement an improved continuum of education that maintains the core values of the field and fits the health care delivery needs of today and the future.","Whelan, Alison J",Acad Med,,352
250773,COVID-19: Short and Long-Term Effects of Hospitalization on Muscular Weakness in the Elderly,2020,"Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) associated bioaerosols have emerged as one of the critical sustainability indicators, ensuring health and well-being of societies and cities. In this context, this review summarizes the various wastewater treatment technologies which have been studied with a focus of bioaerosols emissions, potential emission stages, available sampling strategies, survival and dispersion factors, dominant microbial species in bioaerosols, and possible control approaches. Literature review revealed that most of the studies were devoted to sampling, enumerating and identifying cultivable microbial species of bioaerosols, as well as measuring their concentrations. However, the role of treatment technologies and their operational factors are investigated in limited studies only. Moreover, few studies have been reported to investigate the presence and concentrations of air borne virus and fungi in WWTP, as compared to bacterial species. The common environmental factors, affecting the survival and dispersion of bioaerosols, are observed as relative humidity, temperature, wind speed, and solar illumination. Further, research studies on recent episodes of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 virus) pandemic also revealed that continuous and effective surveillance on WWTPs associated bioaerosols may led to early sign for future pandemics. The evaluation of reported data is bit complicated, due to the variation in sampling approaches, ambient conditions, and site activities of each study. Therefore, such studies need a standardized methodology and improved guidance to help informed future policies, contextual research, and support a robust health-based risk assessment process. Based on this review, an integrated sampling and analysis framework is suggested for future WWTPs to ensure their sustainability at social and/or health associated aspects.","Singh, Nitin Kumar; Sanghvi, Gaurav; Yadav, Manish; Padhiyar, Hirendrasinh; Thanki, Arti",J Hazard Mater,,352

DESIGN: Online cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Data were collected between 17 and 20 July 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2237 participants living in the UK aged 16-75 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reporting having had arguments, felt angry or fallen out with others because of COVID-19. Reporting having confronted or reported someone to the authorities, or that you had been confronted or reported to the authorities, for not wearing a face covering; not keeping your distance from others or being in too large a group; or alternatively following recommended measures too carefully. We used logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with anger and confrontation. RESULTS: Most participants reported having had arguments, feeling angry or fallen out with others because of COVID-19 (56%, n = 1255). Twenty-two percent (n = 500) of participants reported that they had confronted or reported someone. Fourteen percent (n = 304) of participants reported that they had been confronted or reported by someone. Confronting someone, having been confronted and feeling angry or having had arguments were strongly associated with each other. Anger and confrontation were associated with younger age, greater likelihood of experiencing significant financial difficulties due to the pandemic, greater perceived risk of COVID-19 and getting information about COVID-19 from social media. CONCLUSIONS: Measures put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have caused considerable strain. Increased support, clear messaging on the rationale for easing restrictions and combatting misinformation on social media may all help decrease tension.","Smith, Louise E; Duffy, Bobby; Moxham-Hall, Vivienne; Strang, Lucy; Wessely, Simon; Rubin, G James",J R Soc Med,,352
254000,Indoor Environmental Quality in Dwellings and Lifestyle Behaviors during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Russian Perspective,2021,"Infection of certain influenza viruses is triggered when its HA is cleaved by host cell proteases such as proprotein convertases and type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSP). HA with a monobasic motif is cleaved by trypsin-like proteases, including TMPRSS2 and HAT, whereas the multibasic motif found in high pathogenicity avian influenza HA is cleaved by furin, PC5/6, or MSPL. MSPL belongs to the TMPRSS family and preferentially cleaves [R/K]-K-K-R&#8595; sequences. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the extracellular region of human MSPL in complex with an irreversible substrate-analog inhibitor. The structure revealed three domains clustered around the C-terminal &#945;-helix of the SPD. The inhibitor structure and its putative model show that the P1-Arg inserts into the S1 pocket, whereas the P2-Lys and P4-Arg interacts with the Asp/Glu-rich 99-loop that is unique to MSPL. Based on the structure of MSPL, we also constructed a homology model of TMPRSS2, which is essential for the activation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and infection. The model may provide the structural insight for the drug development for COVID-19.","Ohno, Ayako; Maita, Nobuo; Tabata, Takanori; Nagano, Hikaru; Arita, Kyohei; Ariyoshi, Mariko; Uchida, Takayuki; Nakao, Reiko; Ulla, Anayt; Sugiura, Kosuke; Kishimoto, Koji; Teshima-Kondo, Shigetada; Okumura, Yuushi; Nikawa, Takeshi",,,352

258039,Which Risk Factors Matter More for Psychological Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic? An Application Approach of Gradient Boosting Decision Trees,2021,"BACKGROUND: Precise reduction of a syndesmosis after disruption is critical to improve patient physical function. Intraoperative lateral radiographs of the unaffected ankle are often used in clinical practice as a template for anatomic syndesmotic reduction because sagittal plane malreduction is common. However, there is little data to suggest fibular station, or the position of the fibula in the AP plane on the lateral radiograph, is symmetric side-to-side in patients. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Is the position of the fibula in the AP plane (fibular station) on lateral ankle radiographs symmetric in an individual? (2) Do the measurements used to judge the position of the fibula on lateral radiographs have good inter- and intraobserver reliability? METHODS: Over the period from August 2016 to October 2018, we identified 478 patients who presented to an orthopaedic clinic with forefoot and midfoot complaints. Skeletally mature patients with acceptable bilateral lateral ankle radiographs, which are common radiographs obtained for new patients to clinic for any complaint, were included. Based on that, 52% (247 of 478 patients) were included with most (22%, 107 patients) excluded for poor lateral radiographs. The most common diagnosis in the patient cohort was midfoot OA (14%, 35 patients). The median (range) age of the included patients was 54 years (15 to 88), and 65% (159 of 247) of the patients were female. Fibular station, defined as the position of the fibula in the AP plane, and fibular length were measured using a digital ruler and goniometer on lateral radiographs. A paired t-test was used to determine if no difference in fibular station existed between the left and right ankles. With 247 paired-samples, with 80% power and an alpha level of 0.05, we could detect a difference between sides of 0.008 for the posterior ratio, 0.010 for the anterior ratio, and 0.012 for fibular length. Two readers, one fellowship-trained orthopaedic traumatologist and one PGY-4, measured 40 patients to determine the inter- and intraobserver reliability by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: The posterior fibular station (mean right 0.147 [&#963; = 0.056], left 0.145 [&#963; = 0.054], difference = 0.03 [95% CI 0 to 0.06]; p = 0.59), anterior fibular station (right 0.294 [&#963; = 0.062], left 0.299 [&#963; = 0.061], difference = 0.04 [95% CI 0 to 0.08]; p = 0.20), and fibular length (right 0.521 [&#963; = 0.080], left 0.522 [&#963; = 0.078], difference = 0.05 [95% CI 0.01 to 0.09]; p = 0.87) ratios did not differ with the numbers available between ankles. Inter- and intraobserver reliability were excellent for the posterior ratio (ICC = 0.928 and ICC = 0.985, respectively) and the anterior ratio (ICC = 0.922 and ICC = 0.929, respectively) and moderate-to-good for the fibular length ratio (ICC = 0.732 and ICC = 0.887, respectively). CONCLUSION: The use of lateral radiographs of the contralateral uninjured ankle appears to be a valid template for determining the position of the fibula in the sagittal plane. However, further prospective studies are required to determine the efficacy of this method in reducing the syndesmosis over other methods that exists. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, diagnostic study.","Kellam, Patrick J; Dekeyser, Graham J; Bailey, Travis L; Haller, Justin M; Rothberg, David L; Higgins, Thomas F; Marchand, Lucas S",,,352

Emerging viral infections are among the major global public health concerns. The pandemic COVID-19 is a contagious respiratory and vascular disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There are no medicines that can treat SARS-CoV-2 except the vaccines. Therefore, searching for plant-originated therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 is required. Consequently, reviewing medicinal plants used to treat different viral infections is mandatory. This review article aims to review the ethnobotanical knowledge of medicinal plants traditionally used to treat different viral diseases by the Ethiopian people and suggests those plants as candidates to fight COVID-19. Methods. Articles written in English were searched from online public databases using searching terms like ""Traditional Medicine,"" ""Ethnobotanical study,"" ""Active components,"" ""Antiviral activities,"" and ""Ethiopia."" Ethnobotanical data were analyzed using the Excel statistical software program. Result. From the 46 articles reviewed, a total of 111 plant species were claimed to treat viral infections. Fifty-six (50.4%) of the plant species had reported to have antiviral active components that are promising to treat COVID-19. Lycorine, gingerol shogaol, resveratrol, rhoifolin, oleanolic acid, kaempferol, rosmarinic acid, almond oil, ursolic acid, hederagenin, nigellidine, α-hederin, apigenin, nobiletin, tangeretin, chalcone, hesperidin, epigallocatechin gallate, allicin, diallyl trisulfide, ajoene, aloenin, artemisinin, glucobrassicin, curcumin, piperine, flavonoids, anthraquinone, hydroxychloroquine, and jensenone were some of them.

265101,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Total Mortality in Poland,2021,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate whether right ventricular longitudinal strain (RVLS) was independently predictive of higher mortality in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Background: RVLS obtained from 2-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography has been recently demonstrated to be a more accurate and sensitive tool to estimate right ventricular (RV) function. The prognostic value of RVLS in patients with COVID-19 remains unknown. Methods: One hundred twenty consecutive patients with COVID-19 who underwent echocardiographic examinations were enrolled in our study. Conventional RV functional parameters, including RV fractional area change, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, and tricuspid tissue Doppler annular velocity, were obtained. RVLS was determined using 2-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography. RV function was categorized in tertiles of RVLS. Results: Compared with patients in the highest RVLS tertile, those in the lowest tertile were more likely to have higher heart rate; elevated levels of D-dimer and C-reactive protein; more high-flow oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation therapy; higher incidence of acute heart injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and deep vein thrombosis; and higher mortality. After a median follow-up period of 51 days, 18 patients died. Compared with survivors, nonsurvivors displayed enlarged right heart chambers, diminished RV function, and elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Male sex, acute respiratory distress syndrome, RVLS, RV fractional area change, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion were significant univariate predictors of higher risk for mortality (p < 0.05 for all). A Cox model using RVLS (hazard ratio: 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15 to 1.53; p < 0.001; Akaike information criterion = 129; C-index = 0.89) was found to predict higher mortality more accurately than a model with RV fractional area change (Akaike information criterion = 142, C-index = 0.84) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (Akaike information criterion = 144, C-index = 0.83). The best cutoff value of RVLS for prediction of outcome was -23% (AUC: 0.87; p < 0.001; sensitivity, 94.4%; specificity, 64.7%).

265902,Attitudes of Healthcare Personnel towards Vaccinations before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Choir singing is an activity that engages individuals all over the world with a broad demographic representation. Both qualitative and quantitative studies have examined the benefits of the activity but very few have examined the effects when someone loses access to it and stops singing. OBJECTIVES: Examining the governmental and organisational responses precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we asked what happens when a choir singer loses all of their routines associated with regular participation in choir singing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One national choir organization in Sweden (n = 3163) and one in Norway (n = 1881) were approached with a short survey. This comprised questions relating to the issue ""what do you as a choir singer misses the most?"" Each participant was asked to rate the importance of a number of elements that pertain to the experience of choir singing. RESULTS: The social aspect of singing emerged as having the strongest weight in terms of perceived loss that is, it was the element that the participants missed the most. Professional singers report that they miss the aesthetic experiences, flow, and all the physical aspects (physical training, voice training, and breathing training) to a greater degree as compared to reports from the amateurs. The importance of aesthetic experiences and physical components appeared to rise with increasing number of years that an individual had engaged with choir singing. CONCLUSION: In the Scandinavian setting, the social aspect has a stronger weight than the other components and this seemed to be more significant in Norway compared to Sweden.","Theorell, Töres; Kowalski, Jan; Theorell, Ann Mari Lind; Horwitz, Eva Bojner",J. voice,,352

Oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) are now a cornerstone of the WHOs ""Ending Cholera - A Global Roadmap to 2030"" global program for the eventual elimination of cholera. There are currently three WHO prequalified OCVs available, Dukoral®, Shanchol® and Euvichol-Plus®. These vaccines are effective but due to a multiple strain composition and two different methods of inactivation, are complex and costly to manufacture. We describe here the characterization and industrial scale development of Hillchol®; a novel, likely affordable single-component OCV for low and middle-income countries. Hillchol® consists of formalin-inactivated bacteria of a stable recombinant Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor Hikojima serotype strain expressing approximately 50% each of Ogawa and Inaba O1 LPS antigens. The novel OCV can be manufactured on an industrial scale at a low cost. Hillchol® was well tolerated in animal toxicology studies and shown to have non-inferior oral immunogenicity in mice for both intestinal-mucosal and serological immune responses when compared with a WHO-prequalified OCV. The optimized production of this single component OCV will reduce cost of OCV production and thus substantially increase vaccine availability. Based on these results, Hillchol® has been produced at a GMP facility and used successfully for clinical phase I/II studies.","Sharma, Tarun; Joshi, Neeraj; Kumar Mandyal, Ashwani; Nordqvist, Stefan L; Lebens, Michael; Kanchan, Vibhu; Löfstrand, Madeleine; Jeverstam, Frida; Mainul Ahasan, Mohammad; Khan, Imran; Karim, Mahbubul; Muktadir, Hasneen; Muktadir, Abdul; Gill, Davinder; Holmgren, Jan",Vaccine,,352

Considering that many microbes evade innate immune mechanisms to initiate infection, and in light of the discovery of epigenetically mediated innate immune training, the paradigm of vaccine design has the potential to change. The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine induces some level of protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) while stimulating trained immunity that correlates with lower mortality and increased protection against unrelated pathogens. This review will explore BCG-induced trained immunity, including the required pathways to establish this phenotype. Additionally, potential methods to improve or expand BCG trained immunity effects through alternative vaccine delivery and formulation methods will be discussed. Finally, advances in new anti-Mtb vaccines, other antimicrobial uses for BCG, and ""innate memory-based vaccines"" will be examined.","Pasco, Samuel T; Anguita, Juan",,,352

The aim of this study was to objectively investigate olfactory dysfunction in two cohorts of patients at two different stages: during acute illness and after a median recovery of 4 months. METHODS: Twenty-five acutely ill patients and 26 recovered subjects were investigated. Acute patients had a molecular diagnosis of COVID-19; recovered subjects had a positive antibody assay and a negative molecular test. A 33-item psychophysical olfactory identification test tailored for the Italian population was performed. RESULTS: Median time from symptoms onset to olfactory test was 33 days in acute patients and 122 days in recovered subjects. The former scored a significantly higher number of errors at psychophysical testing (median [IQR]: 8 [13] vs 3 [2], p < 0.001) and were more frequently hyposmic (64% vs 19%, p = 0.002). Recovered subjects reported a variable time to subjective olfactory recovery, from days up to 4 months. Participants included in the study reported no significant nasal symptoms at olfactory testing. Among recovered subject who reported olfactory loss during acute COVID-19, four (27%) were still hyposmic. Demographic and clinical characteristics did not show significant associations with olfactory dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Moderate-to-severe hospitalized patients showed a high level and frequency of olfactory dysfunction compared to recovered subjects. In the latter group, subjects who reported persisting olfactory dysfunction showed abnormal scores on psychophysical testing, indicating that, at least in some subjects, persistent hyposmia may represent a long-term sequela of COVID-19.","Pasquini, Jacopo; Maremmani, Carlo; Salvadori, Stefano; Silani, Vincenzo; Ticozzi, Nicola",Neurol Sci,,352

This pandemic represents a great work risk for all health professionals, it includes dental professionals who are in constant contact with saliva, which represents one of the main routes of transmission of the disease. This is due to the fact that a wide variety of oral tissues and cells are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and that they express the ACE2 receptor, which is the main route of entry of the virus into cells, as well as the proteins TMPRSS and furin that contributes to the binding of the virus to the host cells. According to recent studies, some of the oral cells most susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 are the epithelial cells of the salivary glands. This explains the presence of the virus in the saliva of infected patients and provides scientific evidence that supports the use of saliva as a biofluid that offers the opportunity to develop new detection and diagnostic techniques. This is because saliva is much easier to collect compared to nasopharyngeal swab. However, the presence of the virus in saliva, also represents a great source of transmission, since the main form of infection is through microscopic drops that are generated when infected people cough or sneeze. Likewise, health professionals, such as dentists are exposed to contagion through saliva. The objective of this review article is to provide a perspective on the main cells and tissues that can be affected by the virus, the risk of contagion that the presence of the virus in saliva represents for dentists; and the new techniques developed from saliva samples for the diagnosis and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review is expected to contribute to the knowledge of oral health professionals about the risk of saliva in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, but also its advantages as a diagnostic tool for pandemic control. In conclusion, the authors can mention that information that provides more scientific evidence of the mechanisms of infection of the coronavirus in oral cells and tissues is being published continually. This also explains the presence of the virus in the saliva of infected people and the risk of contagion that this means. It also provides scientific evidence of the use of saliva as a biofluid for the detection, diagnosis, monitoring, and control of the spread of the virus.","Casillas Santana, Miguel Angel; Dipp Velázquez, Farid Alonso; Sámano Valencia, Carolina; Martínez Zumarán, Alan; Zavala Alonso, Norma Verónica; Martínez Rider, Ricardo; Salas Orozco, Marco Felipe",Medicina (Kaunas),,352

Countries introduced public health measures to contain and reduce its spread. These measures included closures of educational institutions, non-essential businesses, events and activities, as well as working from and staying at home requirements. These measures have led to an economic downturn of unprecedented proportions. Generally, as economic activity declines, travel decreases and drivers are exposed to a lower risk of collisions. However, research on previous economic downturns suggests economic downturns differentially affect driver behaviours and situations. COVID-19 pandemic effects on road safety are currently unknown. However, preliminary information on factors such as the increased stress and anxiety brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, more ""free"" (idle) time, increased consumption of alcohol and drugs, and greater opportunities for speeding and stunt driving, might well have the opposite effect on road safety. Using an interactionist model we identify research questions for researchers to consider on potential person and situation factors associated with COVID-19 that could affect road safety during and after the pandemic. Collaborative efforts by researchers, and public and private sectors will be needed to gather data and develop road safety strategies in relation to the new reality of COVID-19.","Vingilis, Evelyn; Beirness, Doug; Boase, Paul; Byrne, Patrick; Johnson, Jennifer; Jonah, Brian; Mann, Robert E; Rapoport, Mark J; Seeley, Jane; Wickens, Christine M; Wiesenthal, David L",Accid Anal Prev,,352

A unidirectional association where depression impacts the change in memory (or vice-versa) and a bidirectional association where the trajectories of both dimensions affect each other lead to different clinical implications. METHOD: This study investigated the depression-memory longitudinal association in a sample of 2057 older adults aged between 60 and 99 years old from the Virginia Cognitive Aging Project. The bivariate dual change score model was used to investigate the directionality of the association between episodic memory and three dimensions of depression (somatic symptoms, depressed affect, and positive affect) throughout ten years (five measurement points), controlling for education and sex. RESULTS: the bidirectional model showed the best fit between somatic symptoms and memory, with a significant coupling effect observed from initial somatic symptoms to subsequent changes in memory. For depressed and positive affect, the unidirectional model with initial levels of depression predicting following changes in memory showed the best fit to the data, with significant coupling effects observed. Higher initial levels of somatic symptoms and depressed affect predicted a subsequent decline in memory, and higher initial levels of positive affect predicted subsequent better memory performance. Statistical adjustments for covariates (education and sex) had no significant influence on these associations. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a unidirectional association with higher depressive symptoms preceding a steeper decline in memory in older adults. We discuss the clinical implications for depressive symptoms as a predictor of subsequent memory decline.","Teles, Mariana; Shi, Dingjing",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,,352

There have been several proposed efforts to contain the spread of the virus among humans. Some of these efforts involve appropriate social distancing in public places, monitoring and tracking temperature at the point of access, etc. In order for us to get back to the “new normal"", there is a need for automated and efficient human contact tracing that would be non-intrusive and effective in containing the spread of the virus. In this paper, we have developed “Connect"", a Blockchain and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) based digital contact tracing platform. “Connect"" will provide an automated mechanism to notify people in their immediate proximity of an occurrence of a positive case and would reduce the rate at which the infection could spread. The platform’s self-sovereign identity capability will ensure no attribution to a user and the user will be empowered to share information. The ability to notify in a privacy-preserving fashion would provide businesses to put in place dynamic and localized data-driven mitigation response. “Connect’s"" SSI based identity wallet platform encodes user’s digital identities and activity trace data on a permissioned blockchain platform and verified using SSI proofs. The user activities will provide information, such as places travelled, travel and dispatch updates from the airport etc. The activity trace records can be leveraged to identify suspected patients and notify the local community in real-time.

The 3D model of the femur was created by computerized tomography (CT) scan images, and a Titanium fixture, along with nine Titanium/Hydroxyapatite FGM fixtures, were modeled. The analyses revealed evident advantages for the FGM fixtures over the conventionally used Titanium fixtures. Furthermore, it was shown that the gradation direction considerably affects the bone adaptation procedure. The results showed that using a radial FGM with low-stiffness material in the outer layer and less metal composition significantly improves the bone remodeling behavior.","Ghaziani, Armin Omidvar; Soheilifard, Reza; Kowsar, Sara",J Mech Behav Biomed Mater,,352

274030,Evolving Disaster Response Practices during COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The COVID19 infection is known to be disseminated through the droplets ejected by infected individual during coughing, sneezing, speaking and breathing. The spread of the infection will depend on how the droplets evolve in space and time with changing environmental conditions. In view of this, we investigate here the evolution of the droplets under the purview of the Brownian motion of the evaporating droplets in the air under the action of gravity with varying weather conditions. We track the movement of the droplets till either they gravitationally settle on the ground or evaporate to aerosols of size 2$\mu$m or below and remain suspended in the air. We find that on the one hand the larger droplets falls on the ground under the action of gravity and on the other hand the smaller droplets evaporate to generate aerosols. The intermediate size droplets are very sensitive to the weather conditions which decides whether they will settle in the ground gravitationally or evaporate to aerosol. Therefore, it is clear that the weather condition play crucial in deciding the intensity of spreading of the infection. The effects of relative humidity and temperature on the evaporation of the droplet are found to be significant. It is also noted that under strong wind flow the droplet can travel large distances. These weather dependence effects indicate that the maintenance of physical separation to evade the virus is not corroborated and hence the use of face mask becomes indispensable.","Das, Santosh K.; Alam, Jan-e; Plumari, Salvatore; Greco, Vincenzo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10816v1.pdf,352
274271,Anxiety and Panic Buying Behaviour during COVID-19 Pandemic-A Qualitative Analysis of Toilet Paper Hoarding Contents on Twitter,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has created multiple challenges for health care, social and economic systems worldwide, but also for school and university teaching. Most learning has been shifted to online classes. So far, it is unclear whether these changes are well received within the student body. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was the evaluation of a newly developed online-based teaching concept for medical students studying radiology during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The concept consisted of 12 online seminars of the 11-week course ""Imaging Procedures"", which were combined with 31 prerecorded video presentations. Five weeks after the start of the summer term, we conducted an anonymous online survey, which consisted of 12 questions and a box for additional comments. Furthermore, we analysed the number of requests of the presentations, the duration and the average viewing time. RESULTS: In all, 110 of 213 students (51.6%) completed the survey; 72.7% stated that the new teaching concept drew their interest for radiology, 78.2% agreed that it incited self-study as well as would facilitate time- and place-independent learning (95.5%). The majority indicated that the time investment for the video presentations was appropriate, but shorter video sections would simplify the learning process (70.9%) and the ideal timeframe would be 10-20â¯min. The majority (80.9%) agreed that the concept should be maintained in upcoming semesters. CONCLUSIONS: This newly developed online-based teaching concept enjoys high acceptance rates among students. It offers advantages such as time- and location-independent learning, possibilities for self-study and should be maintained in upcoming semesters after the end of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Surov, Alexey; March, Christine; Pech, Maciej",,,352

Many initial patients were exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold. To investigate possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on the 2019-nCoV sequence. Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019-nCoV may appear to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus. The recombination may occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes a cell surface receptor. Additionally, our findings suggest that 2019-nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and most similar codon usage bias with snake. Taken together, our results suggest that homologous recombination may occur and contribute to the 2019-nCoV cross-species transmission.","Ji, Wei; Wang, Wei; Zhao, Xiaofang; Zai, Junjie; Li, Xingguang",J Med Virol,,352

These changes named collectively as ""immunosenescence"" include decreases in both the innate and adaptive immune responses in addition to the exacerbated production of inflammatory cytokines. This scenario of immunological dysfunction and its relationship with disease development in older people has been widely studied, especially in infections that can be fatal, such as influenza and, more recently, COVID-19. In the current scenario of SARS-CoV-2 infection, many mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in old individuals have been proposed. To better understand the dynamics of COVID-19 in this group, aspects related to immunological senescence must be well elucidated.

275207,Motivation and Continuance Intention towards Online Instruction among Teachers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Effect of Burnout and Technostress,2020,"BACKGROUND: Acceptance rates of COVID-19 vaccines have still not reached the required threshold to achieve herd immunity. Understanding why some people are willing to be vaccinated and others are not is a critical step to develop efficient implementation strategies to promote COVID-19 vaccines. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a theory-based content analysis based on the capability, opportunity, motivation-behavior (COM-B) model to characterize the factors influencing behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 vaccines mentioned on the Twitter platform. METHODS: We collected tweets posted in English from November 1-22, 2020, using a combination of relevant keywords and hashtags. After excluding retweets, we randomly selected 5000 tweets for manual coding and content analysis. We performed a content analysis informed by the adapted COM-B model. RESULTS: Of the 5000 COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets that were coded, 4796 (95.9%) were posted by unique users. A total of 97 tweets carried positive behavioral intent, while 182 tweets contained negative behavioral intent. Of these, 28 tweets were mapped to capability factors, 155 tweets were related to motivation, 23 tweets were related to opportunities, and 74 tweets did not contain any useful information about the reasons for their behavioral intentions (&#954;=0.73). Some tweets mentioned two or more constructs at the same time. Tweets that were mapped to capability (P<.001), motivation (P<.001), and opportunity (P=.03) factors were more likely to indicate negative behavioral intentions. CONCLUSIONS: Most behavioral intentions regarding COVID-19 vaccines were related to the motivation construct. The themes identified in this study could be used to inform theory-based and evidence-based interventions to improve acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.","Liu, Siru; Liu, Jialin",J Med Internet Res,,352

Using a mobile phase composed of 80% methanol and 0.1% formic acid, glycocholic, glycodeoxycholic, and glycochenodeoxycholic acids were separated in less than 4 minutes with sensitivity in the low nM range. Bile acids are thought to contribute to the pathology of various complications in gastroesophageal reflux disease, for instance, Barrett's esophagus, which may eventually lead to esophageal carcinoma. In this pilot study, samples of saliva obtained from 15 patients with Barrett's esophagus of various severities were compared to saliva samples from 10 healthy volunteers. Glycochenodeoxycholic acid was significantly elevated in the patients and principal component analysis of all bile acids could distinguish the most severe Barrett's esophagus patients. We also reported on the detection of glycochenodeoxycholic acid in exhaled breath condensate for the first time.

The case-fatality rate is significantly higher in older patients and those with diabetes, cancer or cardiovascular disorders. The human proteins, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and basigin (BSG), are involved in high-confidence host-pathogen interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We considered these three proteins as seed nodes and applied the random walk with restart method on the human interactome to construct a protein-protein interaction sub-network, which captures the effects of viral invasion. We found that Insulin resistance, AGE-RAGE signaling in diabetic complications and adipocytokine signaling were the common pathways associated with diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disorders. The association of these critical pathways with ageing and its related diseases explains the molecular basis of COVID-19 fatality. We further identified drugs that have effects on these proteins/pathways based on gene expression studies. We particularly focused on drugs that significantly downregulate ACE2 along with other critical proteins identified by the network-based approach. Among them, COL-3 had earlier shown activity against acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress, while entinostat and mocetinostat have been investigated for non-small-cell lung cancer.

Sports can act as triggers of fatal arrhythmias and therefore it is essential to promptly frame the athlete at risk and to carefully evaluate the suitability for both competitive and recreational sports activity. A history of syncope or palpitations, the presence of premature ventricular complexes or more complex arrhythmias, a reduced left ventricular systolic function, or the presence of known or familiar heart disease should prompt a thorough evaluation with second level examinations. In this regard, cardiac magnetic resonance and electrophysiological study play important roles in the diagnostic work-up. The role of genetics is increasing both in cardiomyopathies and in channelopathies, and a careful evaluation must be focused on genotype positive/phenotype negative subjects. In addition to being a trigger for fatal arrhythmias in certain cardiomyopathies, sports also play a role in the progression of the disease itself, especially in the case arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

Similar to other animal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 contains a functional furin cleavage site in its spike protein, which may broaden the SARS-CoV-2 host range and affect pathogenesis. Whether ongoing zoonotic infections are possible in addition to efficient human-to-human transmission remains unclear. In contrast, human-to-animal transmission can occur based on evidence provided from natural and experimental settings. Carnivores, including domestic cats, ferrets and minks, appear to be particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 in contrast to poultry and other animals reared as livestock such as cattle and swine. Epidemiologic evidence supported by genomic sequencing corroborated mink-to-human transmission events in farm settings. Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between experimentally infected cats additionally substantiates the possibility of cat-to-human transmission. To evaluate the COVID-19 risk represented by domestic and farmed carnivores, experimental assessments should include surveillance and health assessment of domestic and farmed carnivores, characterization of the immune interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and carnivore coronaviruses, determination of the SARS-CoV-2 host range beyond carnivores and identification of human risk groups such as veterinarians and farm workers. Strategies to mitigate the risk of zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 infections may have to be developed in a One Health framework and non-pharmaceutical interventions may have to consider free-roaming animals and the animal farming industry.","Jo, Wendy K; de Oliveira-Filho, Edmilson Ferreira; Rasche, Andrea; Greenwood, Alex D; Osterrieder, Klaus; Drexler, Jan Felix",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Thus, the outbreak has forced HPSs to adapt their outpatient consultation services to Telepharmacy to optimize clinical outcomes and reduce the risk of contagion. The purpose of this article is to describe and analyze the experience of HPSs with outpatient Telepharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic and expose the lessons learned. Measures have been adopted in on-site outpatient pharmacy clinics to prevent exposure of patients and professionals to the virus. These measures are based on national and international recommendations on social distancing and hygiene. With regard to remote outpatient pharmacy services, teleconsultation with drug dispensing has been promoted based on five basic procedures, each with its advantages and limitations: home drug delivery from HPSs, with the advantage of universal access and the limitation of entailing a substantial investment in resources; HPS coordination with primary care pharmacists, which requires no investments but with limited access to some geographic areas; HPS coordination with community pharmacists based on a large network of pharmacies, which requires the patient to go to the pharmacy, without confidentiality being guaranteed for any patient; geolocation and hospital-based medication dispensing, which provides universal access and direct traceability, but entails investment in human resources; and HPS coordination with associations of patients, which does not entail any additional cost but limits the information available on the diseases of society members. Three main lessons have been learned during the pandemic: the satisfactory capacity of HPS to provide outpatient pharmacy consultation services in the setting of a public health crisis; the usefulness of Telepharmacy for the clinical follow-up, healthcare coordination, outpatient counseling, and informed dispensing and delivery of medication (with a high level of satisfaction among patients); and the need to foster Telepharmacy as a complementary tool through a mixed model of outpatient pharmacy consultation service that incorporates the advantages of each procedure and adapts to the individual needs of each patient in a context of humanized healthcare.","Margusino-Framiñán, Luis; Illarro-Uranga, Aitziber; Lorenzo-Lorenzo, Karina; Monte-Boquet, Emilio; Márquez-Saavedra, Esther; Fernández-Bargiela, Noelia; Gómez-Gómez, David; Lago-Rivero, Natividad; Poveda-Andrés, José Luis; Díaz-Acedo, Rocío; Hurtado-Bouza, Juan Luis; Sánchez-Gundín, Julia; Casanova-Martínez, Cristina; Morillo-Verdugo, Ramón",Farm Hosp,,352

Here we evaluated the immune response specific for Micobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and SARS-CoV-2 using a whole-blood-based assay-platform in COVID-19 patients either with TB or latent TB infection (LTBI). METHODS: We evaluated IFN-Î³ level in plasma from whole-blood stimulated with Mtb antigens in the Quantiferon-Plus format or with peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate (CD4-S). RESULTS: We consecutively enrolled 63 COVID-19, 10 TB-COVID-19 and 11 LTBI-COVID-19 patients. IFN-Î³ response to Mtb-antigens was significantly associated to TB status and therefore it was higher in TB-COVID-19 and LTBI-COVID-19 patients compared to COVID-19 patients (p &#8804; 0.0007). Positive responses against CD4-S were found in 35/63 COVID-19 patients, 7/11 LTBI-COVID-19 and only 2/10 TB-COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, the responders in the TB-COVID-19 group were less compared to COVID-19 and LTBI-COVID-19 groups (p = 0.037 and 0.044, respectively). Moreover, TB-COVID-19 patients showed the lowest quantitative IFN-Î³ response to CD4-S compared to COVID-19-patients (p = 0.0336) and LTBI-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.0178).

286437,Forecast Possible Risk for COVID-19 Epidemic Dissemination Under Current Control Strategies in Japan,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infection with substantial risk of death, especially in elderly persons. Information about the prognostic significance of functional status in older patients with COVID-19 is scarce. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, laboratory and short-term mortality data were collected of 186 consecutive patients aged &#8805; 65 years hospitalized with COVID-19. The data were compared between 4 study groups: (1) age 65-79 years without severe functional dependency; (2) age &#8805; 80 years without severe functional dependency; (3) age 65-79 years with severe functional dependency; and (4) age &#8805; 80 years with severe functional dependency. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to evaluate the variables that were most significantly associated with mortality in the entire sample. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed between the groups in the proportions of males (p = 0.007); of patients with diabetes mellitus (p = 0.025), cerebrovascular disease (p < 0.001), renal failure (p = 0.003), dementia (p < 0.001), heart failure (p = 0.005), pressure sores (p < 0.001) and malignant disorders (p = 0.007); and of patients residing in nursing homes (p < 0.001). Compared to groups 1 (n = 69) and 2 (n = 28), patients in groups 3 (n = 32) and 4 (n = 57) presented with lower mean serum albumin levels on admission (p < 0.001), and were less often treated with convalescent plasma (p < 0.001), tocilizumab (p < 0.001) and remdesivir (p < 0.001). The overall mortality rate was 23.1 %. The mortality rate was higher in group 4 than in groups 1 - 3: 45.6 % vs. 8.7 %, 17.9% and 18.3 %, respectively (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, both age &#8805; 80 years and severe functional dependency were among the variables most significantly associated with mortality in the entire cohort (odds ratio [OR] 4.83, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.88 - 12.40, p < 0.001 and OR 2.51, 95 % CI 1.02 - 6.15, p = 0.044, respectively). Age &#8805; 80 years with severe functional dependency (group 4) remained one of the variables most significantly associated with mortality (OR 10.42, 95 % CI 3.27-33.24 and p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with COVID-19, the association of severe functional dependency with mortality is stronger among those aged &#8805; 80 years than aged 65-79 years. Assessment of functional status may contribute to decision making for care of older inpatients with COVID-19.","Plotnikov, Galina; Waizman, Efraim; Tzur, Irma; Yusupov, Alexander; Shapira, Yonatan; Gorelik, Oleg",BMC Geriatr,,352

Exploiting the potentials of phytocompounds is an integral component of the international response to this pandemic. In this study, a virtual screening through molecular docking analysis was used to screen a total of 226 bioactive compounds from African herbs and medicinal plants for direct interactions with SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). From these, 36 phytocompounds with binding affinities higher than the approved reference drugs (remdesivir and sobosivir), were further docked targeting the active sites of SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV and HCV RdRp. A hit list of 7 compounds alongside two positive controls (remdesivir and sofosbuvir) and two negative controls (cinnamaldehyde and Thymoquinone) were further docked into the active site of 8 different conformations of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gotten from molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) system equilibration. The top docked compounds were further subjected to predictive druglikeness and ADME/tox filtering analyses. Drugable alkaloids (10'-hydroxyusambarensine, cryptospirolepine, strychnopentamine) and flavonoids (usararotenoid A, and 12&#945;-epi-millettosin), were reported to exhibit strong affinity binding and interactions with key amino acid residues in the catalytic site, the divalent-cation-binding site, and the NTP entry channel in the active region of the RdRp enzyme as the positive controls. These phytochemicals, in addition to other promising antivirals such as remdesivir and sofosbuvir, may be exploited towards the development of a cocktail of anti-coronavirus treatments in COVID-19. Experimental studies are recommended to validate these study.","Ogunyemi, Oludare M; Gyebi, Gideon A; Elfiky, Abdo A; Afolabi, Saheed O; Ogunro, Olalekan B; Adegunloye, Adegbenro P; Ibrahim, Ibrahim M",Antivir Chem Chemother,,352

Patients and methods A review of electronic medical records and endoscopy reports of consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy during two similar one-month time periods (in 2019 and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020) was performed. SPPE was used in 2019 and EPPE was used in 2020. Patient clinical data and procedure-related information were captured and analyzed. The primary outcomes were time to cecum (TTC) and total procedure time. Secondary outcomes were adenoma detection rate (ADR), polyp detection rate (PDR) and cecal intubation rate (CIR). Statistical analysis was performed using STATA v16.1. Results Two hundred and forty-seven colonoscopy procedures were analyzed. Baseline demographics and indications for colonoscopy of patients in both groups were similar. There were no significant differences in median TTC (10.0 vs 10.0min, P =0.524) or total procedure time (22.5 vs 23.0min, P =0.946) between colonoscopy performed in SPPE and EPPE. The ADR, PDR and CIR were also similar.

AIMS: In this paper, we aim to investigate whether (i) the feature of aspiration found in the phonological inventory of several languages and (ii) the frequency of occurrence of stop consonants are associated with the transmission of COVID-19 among humans. METHODS: The study's protocol was based on a corpus of countries infected by COVID-19 and of which the linguistic repertoire includes a widely spoken language in individuals' everyday communication. We tested whether languages with and without aspiration differ in terms of COVID-19 reproduction number, and whether the frequency of occurrence of stop consonants in several languages correlates with the virus reproduction number. RESULTS: The results demonstrated no significant effect of aspiration on the transmission of the virus, while a positive correlation between the frequency of occurrence and transmissibility was observed only for the consonant /p/; this might suggest that languages that use /p/ more frequently might spread the virus more easily. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study can offer a tentative picture of how speaking specific sounds can be associated with COVID-19 transmissibility.","Georgiou, Georgios P; Georgiou, Chris; Kilani, Ahmad",Ir. j. med. sci,,352

This cross-sectional study aims to assess the effects of COVID-19 on the psychological wellbeing of mental health workers who provide care to a vulnerable patient population that have been particularly affected during this crisis. A total of 387 HCWs from across a large urban mental health service completed a self-administered questionnaire consisting of socio-demographic, lifestyle and work-based information and validated psychometric scales. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), respectively; sleep problems with the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS); burnout with the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI); and resilience with the Resilience Scale-14 (RS-14). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine potential mediating factors. Prevalence of burnout was notable, with 52% recording moderate/severe in Emotional Exhaustion, 19.5% moderate/severe in Depersonalisation, and 55.5% low/moderate Personal Accomplishment. Over half of all respondents (52%) experienced sleep problems; the presence of depressive symptoms was a significant predictor of insomnia. An increase in potentially harmful lifestyle changes, such as smoking, alcohol consumption and overeating was also observed. However, high Resilience was reported by 70% of the samples and the importance of this is highlighted. Female gender was associated with increased levels of depression and emotional exhaustion while those with a history of mental health conditions were most at risk of affective symptoms, insomnia, and burnout. Overall, our study revealed considerable levels of psychological distress and maladaptive coping strategies but also resilience and satisfaction with organizational support provided.

SARS-CoV-2 social distancing interventions have modified several aspects of society, leading to a change in the emergency medical visit profile. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of COVID-19 and the resulting changes on the non-SARS-CoV-2 emergency medical care system profile. METHODS: This is a retrospective multicenter cross-sectional study evaluating medical consultations, urgent hospitalizations, and deaths in São Paulo, the largest city of the Americas. Changes in the medical visit profile according to demographic data and diagnoses were assessed. The change in mortality was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 462,412 emergency medical visits were registered from January 2019 to July 2020. Of these emergency medical visits, only 4.7% (21,653) required hospitalization. Of all visits, 592 resulted in deaths, equivalent to 0.1% of the sample. There was a clear decreasing trend in the number of weekly emergency medical visits as social distancing was mandated by decree (Coef. -3733.13; 95% CI -4579.85 to -2886.42; p < 0.001). The number of medical visits for conditions such as trauma, abdominal pain, chest pain, and the common cold decreased (p<0.05). However, the number of medical visits for the following conditions did not change after the onset of the pandemic (p&#8805;0.05): ureterolithiasis, acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the non-SARS-CoV-2 emergency profile. The overall number of emergency medical visits has reduced.

METHODS: A consecutive sample of 60 adult individuals with a history of close contact with COVID-19 infected individuals and mild respiratory symptoms for less than 7 days and 20 confirmed COVID-19 negative healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. Infrared thermograms of the face were obtained with a mobile camera, and RT-PCR was used as the reference standard test to diagnose COVID-19 infection. Temperature values and distribution of the face of healthy volunteers and patients with and without COVID-19 infection were then compared. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients had an RT-PCR confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and 26 had negative test results. The temperature asymmetry between the lacrimal caruncles and the forehead was significantly higher in COVID-19 positive individuals. Through a random forest analysis, a cut-off value of 0.55°C was found to discriminate with an 82% accuracy between patients with and without COVID-19 confirmed infection. CONCLUSIONS: Among adults with a history of COVID-19 exposure and mild respiratory symptoms, a temperature asymmetry of &#8805; 0.55°C between the lacrimal caruncle and the forehead is highly suggestive of COVID-19 infection. This finding questions the widespread use of the measurement of absolute temperature values of the forehead as a COVID-19 screening tool.","Martinez-Jimenez, Mario A; Loza-Gonzalez, Victor M; Kolosovas-Machuca, E Samuel; Yanes-Lane, Mercedes E; Ramirez-GarciaLuna, Ana Sofia; Ramirez-GarciaLuna, Jose L",Eur J Clin Invest,,352
298883,COVID-19 Perceived Impact and Psychological Variables as Predictors of Unhealthy Food and Alcohol Consumption Trajectories: The Role of Gender and Living with Children as Moderators,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To longitudinally analyze the correlates of loneliness and psychological distress in people exposed to the COVID-19 lockdown, exploring the effects of age and self-perceptions of aging (SPA). METHODS: A longitudinal follow-up of 1549 participants was carried out at four different time points during the lockdown in Spain. Questions about the risk of COVID-19, age, SPA, family and personal resources, loneliness, and psychological distress were measured. RESULTS: Changes in loneliness showed a linear longitudinal trajectory through time, but changes in psychological distress showed a U-shaped relationship with time. Age was a relevant predictor of differences in distress, with older people reporting less psychological distress. Change in both dependent variables was related to change in different predictors like family and personal variables, and also to negative SPA. DISCUSSION: In a stressful situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults may be more resilient to adverse mental health outcomes by using more adaptive resources that strengthen their resilience. Support is provided for the importance of stereotyped views of the aging process that, independently of chronological age, may put people at risk of suffering adverse mental health outcomes such as loneliness and psychological distress in times of crisis.","Losada-Baltar, Andrés; Martínez-Huertas, José Ángel; Jiménez-Gonzalo, Lucía; Pedroso-Chaparro, María Del Sequeros; Gallego-Alberto, Laura; Fernandes-Pires, José; Márquez-González, María",,,352

299347,The Impact of Intolerance of Uncertainty on Negative Emotions in COVID-19: Mediation by Pandemic-Focused Time and Moderation by Perceived Efficacy,2021,"BACKGROUND: Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is one of the most frequently diagnosed neoplasms in young adults and is curable even in the relapse setting. Many patients seek advice regarding pregnancy once they have a sustained complete remission (CR). PD1 inhibitors are effective in inducing CRs in relapsed cHL, but little is known about their effects on pregnancy, fetal outcomes, or risk of relapse. The PD1/PDL1 axis is vital in the maintenance of pregnancy, allowing for fetal tolerance. This axis is also a key pathway by which Hodgkin Reed Sternberg cells escape immune surveillance. Thus, exposure to PD1 inhibitors in the context of a pregnant cHL survivor could potentially lead to maternal and fetal complications as well as increase the risk of relapse. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes following PD1 inhibitors have been reported in women with melanoma, but not cHL. Such data may help physicians counsel their patients on this topic. CASE: This case describes a 25-year-old woman who was diagnosed with advanced stage cHL that was treated with multiple courses of chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for primary refractory disease. She experienced a relapse eight months following ASCT and was treated with the PD1 inhibitor pembrolizumab. She completed a total of 21 cycles, achieving a CR after cycle five. After 2 years of sustained CR off pembrolizumab, she had an unassisted and uneventful pregnancy. She delivered a healthy baby boy with no significant complications. He reached his normal milestones in his first year. She remains in CR four years following her last dose of pembrolizumab, evoking the possibility of her being cured of cHL. CONCLUSION: Successful pregnancies and fetal outcomes, while maintaining clinical remissions, are possible in women with relapsed cHL treated with pembrolizumab.","Le-Nguyen, Alexandre; Rys, Ryan N; Petrogiannis-Haliotis, Tina; Johnson, Nathalie A",Cancer Rep (Hoboken),,352

Uniprot database was used to search the corresponding genes of targets, then Cyoscape 3.7.2 software was used to construct the network of medicinal materials-compound-target (gene) for visualization; GO function enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were performed through DAVID to predict its mechanism of action, and histograms and bubble maps were plotted by Prism software and Omicshare database for visualization. Results： The network of medicinal materials-compound-target contained 10 medicinal materials, 123 compounds and 257 corresponding target genes, and the key target genes involved PTGS2, HSP90AB1, AR, CAMSAP2, PPARG, NOS2, etc. GO functional enrichment analysis resulted in 278 GO entries (P &lt; 0.05), including 178 biological processes (BP) entries and 36 cellular component (CC) entries, and 64 molecular function (MF) entries. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that there were 119 (P &lt; 0.05) signaling pathways involving Hepatitis B, small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer and T cell receptor pathways. The results of molecular docking showed that the core compounds such as quercetin, isorhamnetin, irisolidone, kaempferol, wogonin, and baicalein were similar in affinity with the COVID-19 recommended medicine. Among them, quercetin, isorhamnetin and irisolidone had the strongest affinity. Conclusion: The compounds in Huoxiang Zhengqi Oral Liquid can combine with angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) binding to PTGS2, HSP90AB1, AR, CAMSAP2 and other targets to regulate multiple signaling pathways, thus exerting a preventive or therapeutic effect on COVID-19.","Deng, Yan-Jun; Liu, Bo-Wen; He, Zhen-Xiang; Liu, Tao; Zheng, Rong-Lei; Yang, An-Di; Huang, Ao; Li, Yu-Ting; Xu, Yu-Ling",Chin.

302947,Changing Dental Profession-Modern Forms and Challenges in Dental Practice,2021,"Purpose: To safely care for their newborn patients, health-care professionals (HCP) must undergo frequent training to improve and maintain neonatal resuscitation knowledge and skills. However, the current approach to neonatal resuscitation simulation training is time and resource-intensive, and often inaccessible. Digital neonatal resuscitation simulation may present a convenient alternative for more frequent training. Method: Fifty neonatal HCPs participated in the study (44 female;27 nurses, 3 nurse practitioners, 14 respiratory therapists, 6 doctors). This study was conducted at a tertiary perinatal center in Edmonton, Canada from April–August 2019, with 2-month (June–October 2019) and 5-month (September 2019–January 2020) follow-up. Neonatal HCPs were recruited by volunteer sampling to complete a demographic survey, pre-test (baseline knowledge), two digital simulation scenarios (intervention), and post-test (knowledge acquisition). Two months later, participants repeated the post-test (knowledge retention). Five months after the initial intervention, participants completed a post-test using a table-top simulation (knowledge transfer). Longitudinal analyses were used to compare participants' performance over time. Results: Overall the proportion of correct performance increased: 21/50 (42%) passed the pre-test, 39/50 (78%) the post-test, 30/43 (70%) the 2-month post-test, and 32/40 (80%) the 5-month post-test. GLMM and GEE analyses revealed that performance on all post-tests was significantly better than the performance on the pre-test. Therefore, training with the RETAIN digital simulation effectively improves, maintains, and transfers HCPs' neonatal resuscitation knowledge. Conclusions: Digital simulation improved, maintained, and helped transfer HCPs' neonatal resuscitation knowledge over time. Digital simulation presents a promising approach for frequent neonatal resuscitation training, particularly for distance-learning applications.","Ghoman, S. K.; Cutumisu, M.; Schmölzer, G.

We aimed to compare the clinical observations and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with or without CVD. METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were clinically evaluated at Wuhan Seventh People's Hospital, Wuhan, China, from January 23 to March 14, 2020. Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments and outcomes were collected and analyzed in COVID-19 patients with and without CVD. RESULTS: Among 596 patients with COVID-19, 215 (36.1%) of them with CVD. Compared with patients without CVD, these patients were significantly older (66 years vs 52 years) and had higher proportion of men (52.5% vs 43.8%). Complications in the course of disease were more common in patients with CVD, included acute respiratory distress syndrome (22.8% vs 8.1%), malignant arrhythmias (3.7% vs 1.0%) including ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, acute coagulopathy(7.9% vs 1.8%), and acute kidney injury(11.6% vs 3.4%). The rate of glucocorticoid therapy (36.7% vs 25.5%), Vitamin C (23.3% vs 11.8%), mechanical ventilation (21.9% vs 7.6%), intensive care unit admission (12.6% vs 3.7%) and mortality (16.7% vs 4.7%) were higher in patients with CVD (both p < 0.05).

320247,The Geography of the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Data-Driven Approach to Exploring Geographical Driving Forces,2021,"Adenovirus-based vaccines are demonstrating promising clinical potential for multiple infectious diseases, including COVID-19. However, the immunogenicity of the vector itself decreases its effectiveness as a boosting vaccine due to the induction of strong anti-vector neutralizing immunity. Here we determined how dissolvable microneedle patches (DMN) for skin immunization can overcome this issue, using a clinically-relevant adenovirus-based Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine, AdHu5-PfRH5, in mice. Incorporation of vaccine into patches significantly enhanced its thermostability compared to the liquid form. Conventional high dose repeated immunization by the intramuscular (IM) route induced low antigen-specific IgG titres and high anti-vector immunity. A low priming dose of vaccine, by the IM route, but more so using DMN patches, induced the most efficacious immune responses, assessed by parasite growth inhibitory activity (GIA) assays. Administration of low dose AdHu5-PfRH5 using patches to the skin, boosted by high dose IM, induced the highest antigen-specific serum IgG response after boosting, the greatest skewing of the antibody response towards the antigen and away from the vector, and the highest efficacy. This study therefore demonstrates that repeated use of the same adenovirus vaccine can be highly immunogenic towards the transgene if a low dose is used to prime the response. It also provides a method of stabilizing adenovirus vaccine, in easy-to-administer dissolvable microneedle patches, permitting storage and distribution out of cold chain.","Flynn, Olivia; Dillane, Kate; Lanza, Juliane Sousa; Marshall, Jennifer M; Jin, Jing; Silk, Sarah E; Draper, Simon J; Moore, Anne C",,,352
323526,"Standing Breaks in Lectures Improve University Students' Self-Perceived Physical, Mental, and Cognitive Condition",2021,"The initial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic was felt through its life-threatening flu-like infections that caused the death of tens of thousands of people around the world, but an even more serious and enduring effect evolved from the lock-down strategies of governments to contain the infections. It caused mass disruptions in the social and economic life of nations and communities: people were isolated from friends, family and their recreation facilities, businesses went bankrupt, supply chains crumbled, and unemployment increased. The ultimate economic and social consequences of this policy-driven destruction of global systems are unfathomable. They confuse people, causing a feeling of hopelessness and incompetence in their search for solutions to the policy-initiated spillover problems they have to face. They are faced with an uncontrollable wave of change, the nature of which they can only try to understand, and which, it is hoped, will lead to a more desirable future outcome. When they reflected on the emergence of the pandemic, people suddenly became aware of a number of warnings issued since the 1990s about the likelihood of a Covid-19-type flu-like pandemic that would ravage the world. Why were these warnings ignored? Moreover, why did this pandemic become so utterly disruptive that people now struggle to find solutions to it? Three futurists at the international Centre for Post-normal Policy and Futures Studies describe the Covid-19 pandemic as a ""perfect postnormal storm"" in ""post-normal times"". This paper uses aspects of their research to explain the disruptive effect of the Covid-19 pandemic, applying them to the South African situation. The wave of disruptions that were caused by pandemic control is in essence complex systemic. It is very difficult to understand complex systemic change if traditional thinking and established systems of specialised knowledge (the so-called ""cognitive homeland"") are used. What is required is, first, to acknowledge a state of ""invincible ignorance"" in established thinking: an acknowledgement that established thinking must be replaced with new thinking. This requires an exploration of the ""manufactured normalcy field"", which refers to the thought systems that reaffirm normalcy despite major shifts in circumstances. Such an exploration covers, among other things, inquiries into the underpinnings of the ""manufactured normalcy field"", contrasting worldviews, paradigms, values, metaphors, and perspectives. The possible impact of ""strange attractors"" to guide a process of self-organisation in complex systemic change is also important to consider. Such ""strange attractors"" can emerge from information management, values management, heuristic learning designs which may usher in shifts in collective insights, paradigm shifts and new worldviews. South Africans are often reminded that Covid-19 created a new normal which requires them to adapt their outlook on life and their lifestyles. In fact, this country's pre-Covid-19 world was far from normal - since the 1990's South Africans have been living an unsettled life in an unsettled country. In other words, for thirty years they have been trapped in a state of limbo of post-normal times, the nature of which is described by the Centre for Post-normal Policy and Futures Studies as ""an in-between period where the old ways are dying and new ways have yet to be discovered"".","Spies, P.; Jones, C.",Tydskrif Vir Geesteswetenskappe,,352

This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the epidemiology, treatment pathways and 30-day mortality rates of hip fractures. Outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients were compared against those who tested negative. METHODS: An observational, retrospective, multicentre study was conducted across six hospitals in the South East of England. Data were retrieved from the National Hip Fracture Database and electronic medical records. Data was collected for the strictest UK lockdown period (period B=23 March 2020-11 May 2020), and the corresponding period in 2019 (period A). RESULTS: A total of 386 patients were admitted during period A, whereas 381 were admitted during period B. Despite the suspension of the 'Best Practice Tariff' during period B, time to surgery, time to orthogeriatric assessment, and 30-day mortality were similar between period A and B. The length of inpatient stay was significantly shorter during period B (11.5 days vs 17.0 days, p<0.001). Comparison of COVID-19 positive and negative patients during period B demonstrated that a positive test was associated with a significantly higher rate of 30-day mortality (53.6% vs 6.7%), surgical delay >36h (46.4% vs 30.8%, p=0.049), and increased length of inpatient stay (15.8 vs 11.7 days, p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown did not alter the epidemiology of hip fractures. A substantially higher mortality rate was observed among patients with a COVID-19 positive test. These findings should be taken into consideration by the healthcare policymakers while formulating contingency plans for a potential 'second wave'.","Malik-Tabassum, K; Robertson, A; Tadros, B J; Chan, G; Crooks, M; Buckle, C; Rogers, B; Selmon, G; Arealis, G",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,,352

METHODS: The three-dimensional (3D)-coordinate file of the receptor-binding domain (RBD)-ACE2 complex for searching a suitable docking pocket was firstly downloaded and prepared. Secondly, approximately 15,000 molecular candidates were prepared, including US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs from DrugBank and natural compounds from Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP), for the docking process. Then, virtual screening was performed and the binding energy in Autodock Vina was calculated. Finally, the top 20 molecules with high binding energy and their Chinese medicine (CM) herb sources were listed in this paper. RESULTS: It was found that digitoxin, a cardiac glycoside in DrugBank and bisindigotin in TCMSP had the highest docking scores. Interestingly, two of the CM herbs containing the natural compounds that had relatively high binding scores, Forsythiae fructus and Isatidis radix, are components of Lianhua Qingwen (), a CM formula reportedly exerting activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Cov-2. Moreover, raltegravir, an HIV integrase inhibitor, was found to have a relatively high binding score. CONCLUSIONS: A class of compounds, which are from FDA-approved drugs and CM natural compounds, that had high binding energy with RBD of the viral spike protein. Our work provides potential candidates for other researchers to identify inhibitors to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, and highlights the importance of CM and integrative application of CM and Western medicine on treating COVID-19.","Wei, Tian-Zi; Wang, Hao; Wu, Xue-Qing; Lu, Yi; Guan, Sheng-Hui; Dong, Feng-Quan; Dong, Chen-le; Zhu, Gu-Li; Bao, Yu-Zhou; Zhang, Jian; Wang, Guan-Yu; Li, Hai-Ying",Chin J Integr Med,,352

Few reports exist in Latin America, a current epicenter of transmission. Here, we aim to describe the epidemiology and outcomes associated with COVID-19 in Honduras. METHODS: Baseline clinical and epidemiological information of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed cases detected between March 17th-May 4th in the San Pedro Sula Metropolitan area was collected, and, for hospitalized cases, clinical data was abstracted. Logistic regression models were fit to determine factors associated with hospitalization. RESULTS: 877 COVID-19 cases were identified of which 25% (n=220) were hospitalized. The 19-44-year age group (57.8%) and males (61.3%) were predominant in overall COVID-19 cases. 34% of the cases (n=299) had at least one pre-existing medical condition. Individuals aged 45-69 years [aOR= 4.05, 95% CI: 2.85-5.76], &#8805;70 years [aOR= 9.12, 95% CI:5.24-15.86], of male sex [aOR =1.72, CI 95%: 1.21-2.44] and those with a pre-existing condition [aOR= 2.12, 95% CI: 1.43-3.14] had a higher odd of hospitalization. Fifty percent of inpatients were hospitalized more than 7 days. Median length of hospitalization was 13 days [IQR: 8-29] among individuals aged 19-44 years, and 17 days [IQR: 11-24.6] among those aged 45-69. Forty-two percent of the fatal cases occurred among adults under 60 years old. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that a high proportion of COVID-19 cases in Honduras occurred among younger adults, who also constituted a significant proportion of severe and fatal cases.

331238,Naive Forecast for COVID-19 in Utah Based on the South Korea and Italy Models-the Fluctuation between Two Extremes,2020,"Healthcare associated transmission of viral infections is a major problem that has significant economic costs and can lead to loss of life. Infections with the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus have been shown to have a high prevalence in hospitals around the world. The spread of this virus might be impacted by the density of patients inside hospital bays. To investigate this aspect, in this study we consider a mathematical modelling and computational approach to describe the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among hospitalised patients. We focus on 4-bed bays and 6-bed bays, which are commonly used to accommodate various non-COVID-19 patients in many hospitals across the United Kingdom (UK). We investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections among patients in non-COVID bays, in the context of various scenarios: placing the initially-exposed individual in different beds, varying the recovery and incubation periods, having symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients, removing infected individuals from these hospital bays once they are known to be infected, and the role of periodic testing of hospitalised patients. Our results show that 4-bed bays reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to 6-bed bays. Moreover, we show that the position of a new (not infected) patient in specific beds in a 6-bed bay might also slow the spread of the disease. Finally, we propose that regular SARS-CoV-2 testing of hospitalised patients would allow appropriate placement of infected patients in specific (COVID-only) hospital bays.","Martos, David Moreno; Parcell, Benjamin J; Eftimie, Raluca",Math Biosci Eng,,352

It is known that HCWs who serve as front-liners during the COVID-19 pandemic experience stress and have the fear of contracting the infection. Little is known of how being a positive contact affects HCWs. OBJECTIVE: We examined the experience of HCWs who were quarantined following a close unprotected contact with a COVID-19 positive colleague and explore the psychological impact especially as the timing of the quarantine coincided with the Eid (annual Muslim festival) celebration in Malaysia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional on-line questionnaire study, involving HCWs exposed to a COVID-19 positive colleague in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, a teaching hospital. Data on demographics, levels of depression, anxiety and stress using a validated depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) questionnaire, aspects of quarantine, wearing of masks, hand hygiene practice and swab experience were collected. RESULTS: Twenty-two HCWs participated. Eighteen (81.8%) were between 30-39 years and 17 (77.3%) were women. Majority 19 (86.3%) were Malays. There were twelve (54.5%) medical officers, 5 (22.7%) specialists and 5(22.7%) allied health staff. Eighteen out of 22 (81.8%) felt they were able to do home quarantine adequately. All tested negative with a mean (Standard Deviation) hour of contact of 2.56±2.38 hours. Eighteen reported their biggest concern was infecting their families. CONCLUSION: HCWs undergoing contact swabbing and quarantine are vulnerable to depression, anxiety and stress. The ability of the HCW to adequately home quarantine should not be taken for granted. Psychological support should be offered to HCWs who are positive contacts.","Ng, B H; Nuratiqah, N A; Faisal, A H; Soo, C I; Low, H J; Najma, K; Periyasamy, P; Mustafa, N; Andrea, Y L B",Med J Malaysia,,352
335301,Connection to... Addressing Digital Inequities in Supporting the Well-Being of Young Indigenous Australians in the Wake of COVID-19,2021,"The new coronavirus pandemic started in China in 2019. The intensity of the disease can range from mild to severe, leading to death in many cases. Despite extensive research in this area, the exact molecular nature of virus is not fully recognized; however, according to pieces of evidence, one of the mechanisms of virus pathogenesis is through the function of viral miRNAs. So, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis may be due to targeting important genes in the host with its miRNAs, which involved in the respiratory system, immune pathways and vitamin D pathways, thus possibly contributing to disease progression and virus survival. Potential miRNA precursors and mature miRNA were predicted and confirmed based on the virus genome. The next step was to predict and identify their target genes and perform functional enrichment analysis to recognize the biological processes connected with these genes in the three pathways mentioned above through several comprehensive databases. Finally, cis-acting regulatory elements in 5' regulatory regions were analysed, and the analysis of available RNAseq data determined the expression level of genes. We revealed that thirty-nine mature miRNAs could theoretically derive from the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Functional enrichment analysis elucidated three highlighted pathways involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis: vitamin D, immune system and respiratory system. Our finding highlighted genes' involvement in three crucial molecular pathways and may help develop new therapeutic targets related to SARS-CoV-2.","Karimi, Elham; Azari, Hanieh; Yari, Maryam; Tahmasebi, Ahmad; Hassani Azad, Mehdi; Mousavi, Pegah",J Cell Mol Med,,352

Time to moderate-severe ARDS, the need for mechanical or noninvasive ventilation (MV/NIV), death, and a composite of death or MV/NIV were secondary endpoints. Of 138 patients included, 27 (19.6%) were immunosuppressed (IS) and 95 (68.8%) were male, with a median (IQR) age of 68 (54-78) years. A significantly lower proportion of IS patients (25.9%) compared to non-IS patients (52.3%) developed moderate-severe ARDS, in both unadjusted (0.32; 95% CI, 0.13-0.83; p = .017) and adjusted (aOR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.08-0.80; p = .019) analyses.

Nonsignificant trends toward a longer time to moderate or severe ARDS, a lower need for MV/NIV, and a lower risk of death or MV/NIV were detected among IS. In our cohort of COVID-19 patients, nonsevere immunosuppression was associated with a lower risk of moderate-severe ARDS, especially among AD.

Most attribute weighting models selected the final nucleotide sequences (from 29,000th nucleotide positions to the end of the genome) as significantly different among the three virus classes. The genome and proteome sequences of this hot zone area (which corresponds to the 3'UTR region and encodes for nucleoprotein (N)) and Spike (S) protein sequences (as the most important viral protein) were converted into binary images and were analyzed by image processing techniques and Convolutional deep Neural Network (CNN). Although the predictive accuracy of CNN for Spike (S) proteins was low (0.48%), the machine-based learning algorithms were able to classify the three members of coronaviridae viruses with 100% accuracy based on 3'UTR region. For the first time ever, the relationship between the possible structural differences of coronaviruses at the sequential levels and their pathogenesis are being reported, which paves the road to deciphering the high pathogenicity of the SARS-COV-2 virus.","Ahsan, Reza; Tahsili, Mohammad Reza; Ebrahimi, Faezeh; Ebrahimie, Esmaeil; Ebrahimi, Mansour",Comput Biol Med,,352

The sheer size of these networks imposes a challenging computational burden during inference. Existing work focuses primarily on accelerating each forward pass of a neural network. Inspired by the group testing strategy for efficient disease testing, we propose neural group testing, which accelerates by testing a group of samples in one forward pass. Groups of samples that test negative are ruled out. If a group tests positive, samples in that group are then retested adaptively. A key challenge of neural group testing is to modify a deep neural network so that it could test multiple samples in one forward pass. We propose three designs to achieve this without introducing any new parameters and evaluate their performances. We applied neural group testing in an image moderation task to detect rare but inappropriate images. We found that neural group testing can group up to 16 images in one forward pass and reduce the overall computation cost by over 73% while improving detection performance.","Liang, Weixin; Zou, James",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.10704v2.pdf,352

AIMS: The study was conducted as a meta­analysis and a systematic review and aimed to address the following question: which intravascular access method should be used in patients with COVID­19 when wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE)? METHODS: We performed a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases for randomized controlled trials that compared intravascular access methods used by operators wearing full level C PPE. We evaluated procedure duration and the success rate of intraosseous and peripheral intravenous accesses. RESULTS: Eight randomized controlled trials were included in quantitative synthesis. The use of PPE during intravascular access procedures had an impact on procedure duration in the case of intraosseous access (mean difference [MD], 11.69; 95% CI, 6.47-16.92; P <0.001), as well as reduced the success rate of intraosseous access by 0.8% and intravenous access by 10.1%. Under PPE conditions, intraosseous access, compared with peripheral intravenous access, offered a shorter procedure time (MD, -41.43; 95% CI, -62.36 to -24.47; P <0.001). CONCLUSION: This comprehensive meta­analysis suggested that the use of PPE significantly extends the duration of intravascular procedures. However, under PPE conditions, operators were able to obtain intraosseous access in a shorter time and with a higher success rate than in the case of intravenous access.","Drozd, Anna; Smereka, Jacek; Filipiak, Krzysztof J; Jaguszewski, Milosz; Ladny, Jerzy R; Bielski, Karol; Nadolny, Klaudiusz; Ruetzler, Kurt; Szarpak, Lukasz",Kardiol Pol,,352

It greatly reduces the number of tests, however, with a sacrifice of increasing false negative rates due to the dilution of the viral load in pooled samples. Therefore, it is important to balance the trade-off between number of tests and false negative rate. We explore two popular group testing methods, namely linear array (a.k.a. Dorfman's procedure) and square array methods, and analyze the optimal group size of a pooled sample that minimizes the group false negative number under a constraint of testing capacity. Our analysis shows that when there is reasonably large testing capacity, the linear array method yields smaller false negative number and hence is preferred. When the testing capacity is small, square array method is more feasible and preferred. In addition, we consider testing a closed community in a period of time and determine the optimal testing cycle that minimizes the final prevalence rate of infection at the end of the time period. Finally, we provide a testing protocol for practitioners to use these group testing methods in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lin, Yifan; Ren, Yuxuan; Wan, Jingyuan; Zhou, Enlu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06642v1.pdf,352
343249,The Impact of Covid-19 and the Effect of Psychological Factors on Training Conditions of Handball Players,2020,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic philosophers and governments have proposed scarce resource allocation guidelines. Their purpose is to advise healthcare professionals on how to ethically allocate scarce medical resources. One challenging feature of the pandemic has been the large numbers of patients needing mechanical ventilatory support. Guidelines have paradigmatically focused on the question of what doctors should do if they have fewer ventilators than patients who need respiratory support: which patient should get the ventilator? There is, however, an important higher level allocation problem. Namely, how are we to ethically distribute newly obtained ventilators across hospitals: which hospital should get the ventilator(s)? In this paper, we identify a set of principles for allocating newly obtained ventilators across hospitals. We focus particularly on low and middle income countries, who frequently have limited pre-existing intensive care capacity, and have needed to source additional ventilators. We first provide some background. Second, we argue that the main population healthcare aim during the COVID-19 pandemic should be to save the most lives. Next, we assess a series of potential heuristics or principles that could be used to guide allocation: allocation to the most densely populated cities, random allocation, allocation based on the ratio of patients to ICU personnel, prioritisation in terms of intrahospital mortality, prioritisation of younger populations, and prioritisation in terms of population mortality. We conclude by providing a plausible ranking of the principles, while noting a number of epistemological challenges, in terms of how they best further the aim of increasing the probability of saving the most lives.","Palacios-González, César; Pugh, Jonathan; Wilkinson, Dominic; Savulescu, Julian",,,352

When ACE2-highly expressed tissues are manipulated, SARS-CoV-2 containing aerosols may be generated. Normal breathing and speaking are capable of producing aerosols so mask ventilation, suction of airway tract and bucking during tracheal intubation and extubation are clinical procedures capable of significant aerosol production. Whilst no data have been reported on the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the operating room (OR), contamination in the OR can be estimated from the intensive care unit (ICU) data. ICU data showed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected on all types of surface and in air within about 4 m from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. High concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the personal protective equipment (PPE) removal room and medical staff office. Submicron virus-laden aerosols could result from resuspension of particles containing SARS-CoV-2 sticking the PPE surface; removal could produce the initial velocity. Supermicron virus-laden aerosol could come from floor deposited SARS-CoV-2, which were carried across different areas by medical staff (e.g., shoe). Knowledge of aerosol generation and distribution in the OR will aid the design of strategies to reduce transmission risk.","Hirota, Kazuyoshi",J. anesth,,352
343372,"Role of Hybrid Deep Neural Networks (HDNNs), Computed Tomography, and Chest X-rays for the Detection of COVID-19",2021,"BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, the use of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) has rapidly expanded and diversified. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing demand for distance and online learning strategies to support and even replace learning experiences previously afforded by clinical placements and clerkships. An intriguing but under-researched modality is the use of medical reality television to provide authentic experiences of patient care. This strategy does not feature in published medical educational literature, though promising research is emerging from other disciplines. METHODOLOGY: A programme of learning using medical reality television clips to facilitate case-based learning was developed according to the principles of 'anchored instruction', a technology-based educational theory. Clips were taken from the UK television show '24 hours in A&E'. Medical students' learning experiences were investigated using a qualitative approach addressing the following research questions: - What is the perceived emotional experience of medical students when watching reality television in an educational context? - How do medical students relate their experience of watching reality television in a formal educational setting to their perceived learning needs in the clinical environment? A case study research methodology was adopted within the interpretivist paradigm. Data were triangulated from semi-structured interviews with students and non-participant observation of the teaching session. Field notes and transcripts were analysed through an inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: In response to the medical reality television, a diverse range of emotions were expressed including: excitement, amusement, concern, nervousness, sadness and joy. Students identified gaps in their clinical knowledge such as interpreting results, practical aspects of prescribing and end of life care. Key themes were increased student engagement and a promotion of holistic care practices. DISCUSSION: Students perceived reality television as a highly realistic and relatable medium and an enjoyable, memorable way to contextualise learning from the classroom to real life, a finding mirrored in previous studies in other fields. The high degree of emotion expressed may explain the improved subjective memorability of the cases. CONCLUSION: Medical reality television offers a unique means of engaging students by providing authentic experiences of patient care and should be valued alongside other technology-enhanced learning strategies.","Osborne, Fiona; Harrison, Miles; Fisher, James; Bateman, Belinda",BMC Med Educ,,352

This has resulted in delays in virtually all areas of patient care and has forced clinicians to review and adapt their processes, in order to ensure patients continue to have access to timely and effective services. In the author's local Trust, this manifested in altered protocols, developed in order to maintain patient and staff safety while conducting invasive and potentially virus-spreading investigations. A new (temporary) standard operating procedure was developed in conjunction with Cancer Alliance South West to introduce the quantitative faecal immunochemical test (qFIT) as an indicator for diagnostic testing after the majority of diagnostic services were suspended or drastically reduced. Patients would then have their investigation(s) deferred on the basis of a negative result (<10 mcg Hb/g). This cohort (n=120) were revisited once diagnostic services were resumed and referred for CT examination. Audits carried out on the data showed that nine cancers had been identified in the negative qFIT population (lung, prostate, breast, bladder, small bowel carcinoid, oesophageal and three occurrences of caecal carcinoma.

An Analysis of Consumer Data during the Period of COVID-19 in China,2020,"Background: The role of oxidised phospholipid (Ox-PL) in cardiovascular disease (CVD) is not fully uncovered. Oxidised 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (Ox-PAPC) is the most abundant phospholipid in mammalian cells. Atherosclerosis is the major cause of CVD, and Macrophages and T-cells are the most abundant cells in atherosclerotic plaques. Method: Macrophages and T-cells obtained from human peripheral blood or atherosclerotic plaques were stimulated with Ox-PAPC in absence or presence of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species inhibitor (mito tempo) or glutathione (GSH) inhibitor (BSO). The level of phosphatidylcholine, GSH or oxidised glutathione (GSSG) was measured from Plasma collected from healthy donors and patients with atherosclerotic plaques. Immune activation markers, heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), apoptosis, ROS production, and IL-1 beta were measured by flow cytometry and/or ELISA, and the GSH or GSSG and phosphatidylcholine were measured by colorimetric and fluorometric kit respectively Results: Ox-PAPC induced a pro-inflammatory type of T-cell activation but also induced apoptosis at a higher concentration. The Ox-PAPC-induced-immune-activation and apoptosis of T-cells was inhibited by the mito tempo, and the mito tempo or BSO inhibited inflammatory macrophage activation. Furthermore, the level of phosphatidylcholine, GSH and GSSG were significantly higher in atherosclerotic patients than the control group. Ox-PAPC-induced-macrophage induced such effect in vitro cell culture. Conclusion: The higher level of Ox-PL induced imbalance-redox homeostasis and thus higher level of GSH or GSSG could be a risk marker in atherosclerosis, and inhibition of such has possibility to maintain plaque stability.","Frostegard, J.; Steuer, J.; Gillgren, P.; Rahman, M.",Heart Lung Circul.,,352

These connected-health technologies enable monitoring of patients and facilitate remote clinical trial research while reducing the potential for the spread of the novel coronavirus. There is a growing requirement for monitoring of the full 24 h spectrum of behaviours with a single research-grade sensor. This research describes a free-living and supervised protocol comparison study of the Verisense inertial measurement unit to assess physical activity and sleep parameters and compares it with the Actiwatch 2 actigraph. Fifteen adults (11 males, 23.4 ± 3.4 years and 4 females, 29 ± 12.6 years) wore both monitors for 2 consecutive days and nights in the free-living study while twelve adults (11 males, 23.4 ± 3.4 years and 1 female, 22 ± 0 years) wore both monitors for the duration of a gym-based supervised protocol study. Agreement of physical activity epoch-by-epoch data with activity classification of sedentary, light and moderate-to-vigorous activity and sleep metrics were evaluated using Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots. For all activity, Verisense showed high agreement for both free-living and supervised protocol of r = 0.85 and r = 0.78, respectively. For physical activity classification, Verisense showed high agreement of sedentary activity of r = 0.72 for free-living but low agreement of r = 0.36 for supervised protocol; low agreement of light activity of r = 0.42 for free-living and negligible agreement of r = -0.04 for supervised protocol; and moderate agreement of moderate-to-vigorous activity of r = 0.52 for free-living with low agreement of r = 0.49 for supervised protocol. For sleep metrics, Verisense showed moderate agreement for sleep time and total sleep time of r = 0.66 and 0.54, respectively, but demonstrated high agreement for determination of wake time of r = 0.83. Overall, our results showed moderate-high agreement of Verisense with Actiwatch 2 for assessing epoch-by-epoch physical activity and sleep, but a lack of agreement for activity classifications. Future validation work of Verisense for activity cut-point potentially holds promise for 24 h continuous remote patient monitoring.","McDevitt, Bríd; Moore, Lisa; Akhtar, Nishat; Connolly, James; Doherty, Rónán; Scott, William",Sensors (Basel),,352

Rumors are unverified pieces of information spreading online or person-to-person that reduce trust in health authorities and create barriers to protective practices. Risk communication and community engagement can increase transparency, build trust, and stop the spread of rumors. Building on previous work on Ebola and Zika viruses using Global Health Security Agenda systems strengthening support, the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded Breakthrough ACTION project developed a process and technology for systematically collecting, analyzing, and addressing COVID-19 rumors in real-time in Côte d'Ivoire. Rumors were submitted through community-based contributors and collected from callers to the national hotlines and then processed on a cloud-hosted database built on the open-source software District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2). Hotline teleoperators and data managers coded rumors in near-real-time according to behavioral theory frameworks within DHIS2 and visualized the findings on custom dashboards. The analysis and response were done in full collaboration with the Government of Côte d'Ivoire and implementing partners to ensure a timely and coordinated response. The system captured both widespread rumors consistent with misinformation in other settings, such as suspicions about case counts and the belief that masks were deliberately contaminated, as well as very localized beliefs related to specific influencers. The qualitative findings provided rapid insights on circulating beliefs, enabling risk communicators to nuance and tailor messaging around COVID-19.","Tibbels, Natalie; Dosso, Abdul; Allen-Valley, Aliya; Benie, William; Fordham, Corinne; Brou, Jeanne Aka; Nana, Marjorie; Zounneme, Valère; Silué, Korodénin Fatoumata; Kamara, Diarra; Naugle, Danielle",Glob Health Sci Pract,,352

363216,Changes in Prehospital Stroke Care and Stroke Mimic Patterns during the COVID-19 Lockdown,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is the most recent example of an emergent coronavirus that poses a significant threat to human health. Virus-host interactions play a major role in the viral life cycle and disease pathogenesis, and cellular pathways such as macroautophagy/autophagy prove to be either detrimental or beneficial to viral replication and maturation. Here, we describe the literature over the past twenty years describing autophagy-coronavirus interactions. There is evidence that many coronaviruses induce autophagy, although some of these viruses halt the progression of the pathway prior to autophagic degradation. In contrast, other coronaviruses usurp components of the autophagy pathway in a non-canonical fashion. Cataloging these virus-host interactions is crucial for understanding disease pathogenesis, especially with the global challenge of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. With the recognition of autophagy inhibitors, including the controversial drug chloroquine, as possible treatments for COVID-19, understanding how autophagy affects the virus will be critical going forward.

The observational study was based on data from official governmental sources collected since the inception of epidemic until 28 April 2020. DALYs for a disease combines the years of life lost due to premature mortality in the population and the years lost due to disability of the disease. In addition to DALYs, temporary productivity loss due to absenteeism from work and permanent productivity loss due to premature mortality were estimated using the Human Capital Approach. The total DALYs amount to 2.01 per 1000 persons. The total permanent productivity loss was around EUR 300 million while the temporary productivity loss was around EUR 100 million.

We present epidemiological data for all notified cases of COVID-19 among the 17 largest immigrant groups in Norway, and related hospitalizations and mortality. Methods: We used data on all notified COVID-19 cases in Norway up to 18 October 2020, and associated hospitalizations and mortality, from the emergency preparedness register (including Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases) set up by The Norwegian Institute of Public Health to handle the pandemic. We report numbers and rates per 100,000 people for notified COVID-19 cases, and related hospitalizations and mortality in the 17 largest immigrant groups in Norway, crude and with age adjustment. Results: The notification, hospitalization and mortality rates per 100,000 were 251, 21 and five, respectively, for non-immigrants; 567, 62 and four among immigrants; 408, 27 and two, respectively, for immigrants from Europe, North-America and Oceania; and 773, 106 and six, respectively for immigrants from Africa, Asia and South America. The notification rate was highest among immigrants from Somalia (2057), Pakistan (1868) and Iraq (1616). Differences between immigrants and non-immigrants increased when adjusting for age, especially for mortality. Immigrants had a high number of hospitalizations relative to notified cases compared to non-immigrants. Although the overall COVID-19 notification rate was higher in Oslo than outside of Oslo, the notification rate among immigrants compared to non-immigrants was not higher in Oslo than outside. Conclusions: We observed a higher COVID-19 notification rate in immigrants compared to non-immigrants and much higher hospitalization rate, with major differences between different immigrant groups. Somali-, Pakistani- and Iraqi-born immigrants had especially high rates.","Indseth, Thor; Grøsland, Mari; Arnesen, Trude; Skyrud, Katrine; Kløvstad, Hilde; Lamprini, Veneti; Telle, Kjetil; Kjøllesdal, Marte",Scand J Public Health,,352

Methods: In a cross-sectional study, a 21-question survey was circulated using digital media platform to approximately 1400 ophthalmologists in India between 16th August 2020 to 31st August 2020. The questionnaire focussed on the quality and usefulness of webinars based on the Bloom's taxonomy. The responses (on 4- or 5-point Likert scale) were analyzed among three professional groups- ophthalmologists in-training, consultants in public sector, and private practitioners. Results: 393 ophthalmologists participated in the survey, with a response rate of 28%. The mean age was 34.6 ± 9.7 years, and males constituted 49.6% (199/393) of the respondents. Forty-seven percent of the respondents perceived the quality of webinars as good or excellent (185/393), 72.8% reported knowledge gain from webinars (286/393), and 63.9% felt that webinars are important in clinical practice and should continue post-COVID-19 pandemic (251/393), with distinct responses among the professional groups. The drawbacks perceived were overt number of webinars (371; 94.4%), confusion regarding which webinars to attend (313; 79.6%), repetition of the information (296; 75.3%), limited opportunity for participant interaction (146; 37.2%) and disparate weightage to the core disciplines of Ophthalmology. Conclusion: Most respondents had favorable perceptions of Ophthalmology webinars happening during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is need for improvisation in the volume of webinars, target-audience-based delivery, and participant interaction to add value to this new dimension of teaching-learning.","Rana, Rimpi; Kumawat, Devesh; Sahay, Pranita; Gour, Neeraj; Patel, Siddharth; Samanta, Ramanuj; Singh, Anupam; Mittal, Sanjeev",Indian J Ophthalmol,,352
371439,Impact of Hospital Bed Shortages on the Containment of COVID-19 in Wuhan,2020,"The diversity reflected by >100 different neural cell types fundamentally contributes to brain function and a central idea is that neuronal identity can be inferred from genetic information. Recent large-scale transcriptomic assays seem to confirm this hypothesis, but a lack of morphological information has limited the identification of several known cell types. In this study, we used single-cell RNA-seq in morphologically identified parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs), and studied their transcriptomic states in the morphological, physiological, and developmental domains. Overall, we find high transcriptomic similarity among PV-INs, with few genes showing divergent expression between morphologically different types. Furthermore, PV-INs show a uniform synaptic cell adhesion molecule (CAM) profile, suggesting that CAM expression in mature PV cells does not reflect wiring specificity after development. Together, our results suggest that while PV-INs differ in anatomy and in vivo activity, their continuous transcriptomic and homogenous biophysical landscapes are not predictive of these distinct identities.","Que, Lin; Lukacsovich, David; Luo, Wenshu; Földy, Csaba",Nat Commun,,352

The most frequent difficulty of the children was online homeschooling (30.4%), followed by sleeping disorders (20.3%). The use of screens increased 30-80% in over 65% of children. Tantrum was detected in 34% and mood swings in 30% of children. The majority of parents (77.8%) considered that distance education does not guarantee children's education and that the level of learning acquired through online classes is not the same as that of face-to-face education (83.5%). In contrast, 70.6% of parents considered that it is not yet time to reopen schools, 78.8% believed that there is sufficient evidence to keep them closed, and 45% indicated that it is better not to return to campus this year. Regarding activities to improve mental health during the contingency, 51.3% have created home games, and 23.6% perform physical activity. However, 74.4% do not have the peace of mind to restart daily life. Among the positive aspects of the contingency, adaptability (35%) and family union (33.5%) were reported.

METHODS: Phone interviews were conducted with 103 patients with mild COVID-19 in Israel over a 6-month period (April 2020 to October 2020). Patients were recruited via social media and word to mouth and were interviewed up to 4 times, depending on reports of their unresolved symptoms. Inclusion criteria required participants to be residents of Israel aged 18 years or older, with positive COVID-19 real-time PCR results and nonsevere symptoms. The onset, duration, severity and resolution of symptoms were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 44% (45/103), 41% (42/103), 39% (40/103) and 38% (39/103) of patients experienced headache, fever, muscle ache and dry cough as the first symptom respectively. Smell and taste changes were experienced at 3.9 ± 5.4 and 4.6 ± 5.7 days (mean ± standard deviation (SD)) after disease onset respectively. Among prevalent symptoms, fever had the shortest duration (5.8 ± 8.6 days), and taste and smell changes were the longest-lasting symptoms (17.2 ± 17.6 and 18.9 ± 19.7 days; durations censored at 60 days). Longer recovery of the sense of smell correlated with the extent of smell change. At the 6-month follow-up, 46% (47/103) of the patients had at least one unresolved symptom, most commonly fatigue (22%, 23/103), smell and taste changes (15%, 15/103 and 8%, 8/103 respectively) and breathing difficulties (8%, 8/103).

By making them main actors in the management of this health crisis, they have been exposed to various psychosocial risks (stress, trauma, fatigue, etc). Paradoxically, stress-related symptoms are often underreported in this vulnerable population but are potentially detectable through passive monitoring of changes in speech behavior. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the use of rapid and remote measures of stress levels in health professionals working during the COVID-19 outbreak. This was done through the analysis of participants' speech behavior during a short phone call conversation and, in particular, via positive, negative, and neutral storytelling tasks. METHODS: Speech samples from 89 health care professionals were collected over the phone during positive, negative, and neutral storytelling tasks; various voice features were extracted and compared with classical stress measures via standard questionnaires. Additionally, a regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Certain speech characteristics correlated with stress levels in both genders; mainly, spectral (ie, formant) features, such as the mel-frequency cepstral coefficient, and prosodic characteristics, such as the fundamental frequency, appeared to be sensitive to stress. Overall, for both male and female participants, using vocal features from the positive tasks for regression yielded the most accurate prediction results of stress scores (mean absolute error 5.31). CONCLUSIONS: Automatic speech analysis could help with early detection of subtle signs of stress in vulnerable populations over the phone. By combining the use of this technology with timely intervention strategies, it could contribute to the prevention of burnout and the development of comorbidities, such as depression or anxiety.","König, Alexandra; Riviere, Kevin; Linz, Nicklas; Lindsay, Hali; Elbaum, Julia; Fabre, Roxane; Derreumaux, Alexandre; Robert, Philippe",J Med Internet Res,,352

Male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups. Except for the control group, CORT (40 mg per kg·bw) was injected subcutaneously for 21 consecutive days to induce testicular toxicity. 1 h before CORT injection, the rats were treated with EEM (400 mg per kg·bw) and M 18:3 (5 mg per kg·bw, 25 mg per kg·bw) by gavage, except for the control group and model group. Epididymal sperm and biochemical, and histological parameters were evaluated for the protective effects of the drugs. EEM (400 mg per kg·bw) and M 18:3 (5 mg per kg·bw, 25 mg per kg·bw) increased the sperm concentration and sperm motility, decreased the production of abnormal sperms, and increased the number of spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes in the seminiferous tubules of CORT-induced rats. Moreover, EEM and M 18:3 decreased the MDA levels and the positive expression rates of TUNEL, whereas they increased the activities of SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, and GST, and the contents of GSH in the testicles of CORT-induced rats. Furthermore, EEM and M 18:3 alleviated CORT-induced reduction in the positive expression rates of PCNA and Ki67 in the testicles of rats. Besides, EEM and M 18:3 reduced the expression levels of Keap-1 and increased the expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1, Î³-GCS, and NQO1 in the testicles of CORT-induced rats. In summary, the protective effects of EEM and M 18:3 may be attributed to their anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic properties.","Yu, Zejun; Liu, Hao; Li, Dong; Chen, Xuemin; Ao, Mingzhang; Jin, Wenwen; Yu, Longjiang",Food funct,,352

The disease has imposed a huge burden on health resources. Evaluation of clinical and epidemiological profiles of such patients can help in understanding and managing the outbreak more efficiently. This study was a prospective observational analysis of 200 diagnosed COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary care center from 20th march to 8th May 2020. All these patients were positive for COVID-19 by an oro-nasopharyngeal swab-rtPCR based testing. Analyses of demographic factors, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, and the outcomes were performed. The mean age of the population was 40 years with a slight male predominance (116 patients out of 200, 58%). A majority of the patients (147, 73.5 %) were symptomatic, with fever being the most common symptom (109, 54.5%), followed by cough (91, 45.5%). An older age, presence of symptoms and their duration, leukocytosis, a high quick SOFA score, a high modified SOFA score, need for ventilator support, an AST level more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), and a serum creatinine level of 2 mg/dl or greater were at a significantly higher risk of ICU admission and mortality. Presence of diabetes mellitus, AST > three times ULN, serum creatinine 2 mg/dl or higher, and a qSOFA score of 1 or higher were all associated with significantly greater odds of critical care requirement. Triage and severity assessment helps in deciding the requirement for a hospital stay and ICU admission for COVID-19 which can easily be done using clinical and laboratory parameters.

Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that these lncRNAs might be involved in numerous biological processes. Clustering analysis of differentially expressed lncRNAs showed that 454 annotated and 376 novel lncRNAs were regulated after PDCoV infection. Furthermore, we constructed a lncRNA-protein-coding gene co-expression interaction network. The KEGG analysis of the co-expressed genes showed that these differentially expressed lncRNAs were enriched in pathways related to metabolism and TNF signaling. Our study provided comprehensive information about lncRNAs that would be a useful resource for studying the pathogenesis of and designing antiviral therapy for PDCoV infection.","Liu, Junli; Wang, Fangfang; Du, Liuyang; Li, Juan; Yu, Tianqi; Jin, Yulan; Yan, Yan; Zhou, Jiyong; Gu, Jinyan",Front.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included a cohort of patients admitted to one of three major hospitals of our healthcare network including, an academic medical center and comprehensive stroke center, which accepts transfers for complex cases from eight community hospitals, during March 1 to May 1, 2020. All patients that received imaging of the neuroaxis and had positive PCR testing for COVID-19 were identified and reviewed by an attending neuroradiologist. Demographics and comorbidities were recorded. Biomarkers were recorded from the day of the hemorrhagic event. Vital signs from the day of the hemorrhagic event mechanical ventilation orders at admission were recorded. Imaging findings were divided into 5 subtypes; acute subdural hematoma (SDH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), multi-compartmental hemorrhage (MCH), multi-focal intracerebral hemorrhage (MFH), and focal intracerebral hemorrhage (fICH). Outcomes were recorded as non-routine discharge and mortality. RESULTS: We found a total of 35 out of 5227 patients with COVID-19 that had hemorrhage of some kind. Mortality for the entire cohort was 45.7 % (nâ¯=â¯16). SDH patients had a mortality rate of 35.3 % (nâ¯=â¯6), SAH had a mortality of 50 % (nâ¯=â¯1), MCH patients had a mortality of 71.4 % (nâ¯=â¯5), MFH patients had a mortality of 50 % (nâ¯=â¯2), fICH patients had a mortality of 40 % (nâ¯=â¯2).

Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of secretory cells in the respiratory tract. Chronic smoke exposure triggers the expansion of this cell population and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, our work identifies ACE2 as an interferon-stimulated gene in lung cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections could create positive feedback loops that increase ACE2 levels and facilitate viral dissemination.","Smith, Joan C; Sausville, Erin L; Girish, Vishruth; Yuan, Monet Lou; Vasudevan, Anand; John, Kristen M; Sheltzer, Jason M",Dev Cell,,352

Three main themes were identified following the data extraction: (a) evidence against/inconclusive regarding ECMO for COVID-19, (b) evidence supporting ECMO for COVID-19, and finally (c) VV-ECMO and VA-ECMO. After combining the data, there were 3428 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and 95 ECMO-associated deaths (19.83%). CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the paucity of evidence and the need for further data to consolidate the efficacy of ECMO in improving patient outcomes. Although ECMO has been shown to be beneficial in a selected group of patients, the recuperative effects of ECMO remain inconclusive. We must ensure that risk-benefit analysis for each candidate is conducted thoroughly so that patients that have increased probability of survival can benefit from this scarce resource.","Haiduc, Ana Alina; Alom, Samiha; Melamed, Naomi; Harky, Amer",J Card Surg,,352

In the ensuing months it has been transmitted worldwide. Here the authors present the current knowledge on the epidemiology of this virus. SARS-CoV­2 replicates mainly in the upper and lower respiratory tract and is primarily transmitted by droplets from asymptomatic and symptomatic infected subjects. The estimate for the basic reproduction number (R) is currently between 2 and 3, while the incubation period is 6 (median, range 2-14) days. Although most infections are uncomplicated, 5-10% of cases develop pneumonia, which can lead to hospitalization, respiratory failure and multiorgan failure. Risk factors for a complicated disease course include age, hypertension, chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary disease and immunodeficiency. The overall case fatality rate is 1.4%, with the rate rising in the sixth decade of life. Nosocomial and infections in medical personnel have been reported. Drastic reductions in social contact have been implemented in many countries with outbreaks of SARS-CoV­2, leading to rapid reductions in R. Which of the measures have been effective is still unknown.","Salzberger, B; Buder, F; Lampl, B; Ehrenstein, B; Hitzenbichler, F; Hanses, F",Internist (Berl),,352

Rapid antigen-detection tests are faster and less expensive;however, the reliability of these tests must be validated before they can be used widely. The objective of this study was to determine the performance of the Panbio TM COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (PanbioRT) (Abbott) in detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. METHODS: This prospective multicentre study was carried out in ten Spanish university hospitals and included individuals with clinical symptoms or epidemiological criteria of COVID-19. Only individuals with &lt;=7 days from the onset of symptoms or from exposure to a confirmed case of COVID-19 were included. Two nasopharyngeal samples were taken to perform the PanbioRT as a point-of-care test and a diagnostic RT-PCR test. RESULTS: Among the 958 patients studied, 325 (90.5%) had true-positive results. The overall sensitivity and specificity for the PanbioRT were 90.5% (95%CI 87.5-93.6) and 98.8% (95%CI 98-99.7), respectively. Sensitivity in participants who had a threshold cycle (C&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; 25 for the RT-PCR test was 99.5% (95%CI 98.4-100), and in participants with &lt;=5 days of the clinical course it was 91.8% (95%CI 88.8-94.8). Agreement between techniques was 95.7% (kappa score 0.90;95%CI 0.88-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: The PanbioRT performs well clinically, with even more reliable results for patients with a shorter clinical course of the disease or a higher viral load. The results must be interpreted based on the local epidemiological context.","Merino, P.; Guinea, J.; Munoz-Gallego, I.; Gonzalez-Donapetry, P.; Galan, J.

387405,How Personality Relates to Distress in Parents during the Covid-19 Lockdown: The Mediating Role of Child's Emotional and Behavioral Difficulties and the Moderating Effect of Living with Other People,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the pandemic impact on the relationship between nurses' perception of the authentic nurse leadership (ANL) of their manager and their perception of the work environment. BACKGROUND: Both ANL and healthy work environment (HWE) contribute to staff and patient outcomes. Our 1st study of these 2 variables revealed a positive relationship. Will this be upheld in a pandemic year? METHODS: More than 5000 nurses from a national sample participated in a cross-sectional, correlational, descriptive study using the Authentic Nurse Leadership Questionnaire, the Critical Elements of a Healthy Work Environment Scale, and a pandemic impact on practice question. RESULTS: Overall, nurses perceived ANL and HWE were present despite a high level of pandemic impact; however, when clinical nurses were separated from managers/directors, HWE was not present for frontline nurses. The moderate correlation of ANL and HWE was replicated in this larger study. CONCLUSIONS: This is the 2nd study of the positive relationship between ANL and HWE using these models, supporting ANL as an essential standard of a HWE. ANL was present for clinical nurses in a pandemic year signaling that nurse leaders rose to meet frontline leadership needs. HWE was present overall, but not for clinical nurses. Leadership is essential to work environments and outcomes especially in times of crisis and significant change.","Raso, Rosanne; Fitzpatrick, Joyce J; Masick, Kevin; Giordano-Mulligan, Marie; Sweeney, Cynthia D",J Nurs Adm,,352
387517,Examining the Change of Human Mobility Adherent to Social Restriction Policies and Its Effect on COVID-19 Cases in Australia,2020,"The novel corona (SARS-CoV-2) virus causes a global pandemic, which motivates researchers to develop reliable and effective methods for screening and detection of SARS-CoV-2. Though there are several methods available for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 such as RT-PCR and ELSIA, nevertheless, these methods are time-consuming and may not apply at the point of care. In this study, we have developed a specific, sensitive, quantitative and fast detection method for SARS-CoV-2 by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. The total extracellular protease proteolytic activity from the virus has been used as the biomarker. The specific peptide sequences from the library of 115 dipeptides were identified via changes in the fluorescence signal. The fluorogenic dipeptide substrates have the fluorophore and a quencher at the N- and the C- terminals, respectively. When the protease hydrolyzes the peptide bond between the two specific amino acids, it leads to a significant increase in the fluorescence signals. The specific fluorogenic peptide (H-d) produces a high fluorescence signal. A calibration plot was obtained from the changes in the fluorescence intensity against the different concentrations of the viral protease. The lowest limit of detection of this method was 9.7 ± 3 pfu/mL. The cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2-specific peptide was tested against the MERS-CoV which does not affect the fluorescence signal. A significant change in the fluorescence signal with patient samples indicates that this FRET-based assay might be applied for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 patients.

389214,Brazil's Actions and Reactions in the Fight Against COVID-19 from January to March 2020,2021,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a devastating effect on the global public health. Computed Tomography (CT) is an effective tool in the screening of COVID-19. It is of great importance to rapidly and accurately segment COVID-19 from CT to help diagnostic and patient monitoring. In this paper, we propose a U-Net based segmentation network using attention mechanism. As not all the features extracted from the encoders are useful for segmentation, we propose to incorporate an attention mechanism including a spatial attention module and a channel attention module, to a U-Net architecture to re-weight the feature representation spatially and channel-wise to capture rich contextual relationships for better feature representation. In addition, the focal Tversky loss is introduced to deal with small lesion segmentation. The experiment results, evaluated on a COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset where 473 CT slices are available, demonstrate the proposed method can achieve an accurate and rapid segmentation result on COVID-19. The method takes only 0.29 second to segment a single CT slice. The obtained Dice Score and Hausdorff Distance are 83.1% and 18.8, respectively.","Zhou, Tongxue; Canu, Stéphane; Ruan, Su",,,352

We sought to examine cancer care providers' attitudes toward the barriers and facilitators related to the care for these patients during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Members of the Advocacy Committee of the Cancer and Aging Research Group, along with the Association of Community Cancer Centers, developed the survey distributed to multidisciplinary healthcare providers responsible for the direct care of patients with cancer. Participants were recruited by email sent through four professional organizations' listservs, email blasts, and messages through social media. RESULTS: Complete data was available from 274 respondents. Only 15.4% had access to written guidelines that specifically address the management of older adults with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Age was ranked fifth as the reason for postponing treatment following comorbid conditions, cancer stage, frailty, and performance status. Barriers to the transition to telehealth were found at the patient-, healthcare worker-, and institutional-levels. Providers reported increased barriers in accessing basic needs among older adults with cancer. Most respondents agreed (86.3%) that decision making about Do Not Resuscitate orders should be the result of discussion with the patient and the healthcare proxy in all situations. The top five concerns reported were related to patient safety, treatment delays, healthcare worker mental health and burnout, and personal safety for family and self. CONCLUSION: These findings demand resources and support allocation for older adults with cancer and healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","BrintzenhofeSzoc, Karlynn; Krok-Schoen, Jessica I; Pisegna, Janell L; MacKenzie, Amy R; Canin, Beverly; Plotkin, Elana; Boehmer, Leigh M; Shahrokni, Armin",Journal of geriatric oncology,,352

We previously showed that zygotic venlafaxine deposition alters larval behavior in zebrafish (Danio rerio), but the mechanisms were unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that venlafaxine disrupts central serotonergic development, leading to impaired behavioral responses in zebrafish larvae. This was tested by microinjecting embryos with venlafaxine immediately after fertilization and performing spatial distribution of serotonin immunoreactivity, as well as characterizing target genes involved in serotonin turnover in the zebrafish brain. We provide evidence that venlafaxine exposure reduces serotonin immunoreactivity and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cell populations in specific larval brain regions, and this corresponded with reduced larval activity observed in the drug-exposed group. Lowered serotonin was not due to either reduced synthesis or increased breakdown capacity. However, co-injection of serotonin alongside venlafaxine in embryos recovered brain serotonin immunoreactivity, tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cell populations, and rescued venlafaxine-mediated behavioral changes. Overall, our results demonstrate for the first time that early life exposure to venlafaxine perturbs brain development, which may be due to reduced serotonin, leading to altered larval behavior in zebrafish.","Thompson, William Andrew; Vijayan, Mathilakath M",Environ Sci Technol,,352
396828,The Impact of Online Media on Parents' Attitudes toward Vaccination of Children-Social Marketing and Public Health,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The outbreak of novel COVID-19 caught the world off guard in the first quarter of 2020. To stem the tide of this pandemic, there was acceleration of the development, testing and prelicensure approval for emergency use of some COVID-19 vaccine candidates. This led to raised public concern about their safety and efficacy, compounding the challenges of vaccine hesitancy. The onus of managing and administering these vaccines to a sceptical populace when they do become available rests mostly on the shoulders of healthcare workers (HCWs). Therefore, the vaccine confidence levels of HCWs become critical to the success of vaccination endeavours. This proposed study aims to estimate the level of vaccine confidence and the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine among future HCWs and their trainers at a specific university in Cape Town, South Africa, and to identify any vaccination concerns early for targeted intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This proposed study is a cross-sectional survey study. An online questionnaire will be distributed to all current staff and students of the Faculty of Medicine Health Sciences of Stellenbosch University in Cape Town, South Africa. No sampling strategy will be employed. The survey questionnaire will consist of demographic questions (consisting of six items) and vaccine confidence questions (comprising six items in Likert scale format). Log binomial models will be employed to identify factors associated with vaccine confidence and intention. The strength of association will be assessed using the OR and its 95% CI. Statistical significance will be defined at a p value <0.05. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been obtained for the study from Stellenbosch University (Human Research Ethics Committee reference number S19/01/014 (PhD)). The results will be shared with relevant health authorities, presented at conferences and published in a peer-reviewed journal.","Oduwole, Elizabeth O; Mahomed, Hassan; Ayele, Birhanu T; Wiysonge, Charles Shey",BMJ Open,,352

Asymptomatic cases for COVID-19 infection were rarely described. Herein, we studied a 62-year-old patient with progressive weakness of lower extremities, rapidly evolving to a severe, flaccid tetraplegia and dysphagia. Neurological symptoms weren't preceded by fever or pulmonary symptoms. Because of laboratory test abnormalities (thrombocytopenia, lymphocytopenia, high inflammation indexes), the patient underwent to nasopharyngeal swab, resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR assay; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for SARS-CoV-2. The clinical (severe symmetric distal upper and lower limbs weakness, grade 0/5; decreased proprioceptive sensitivity and hypoesthesia involving the four limbs; loss of deep tendon reflexes), electrophysiological (prevailing axonal polyradiculoneuritis) and CSF features (albumino-cytological dissociation) disclosed the GBS diagnosis (level 1 of diagnostic certainty according to the Brighton criteria). The patient received plasma exchange and immunoglobulin, and, at 4 weeks after treatment and physical therapy, the patient had moderate improvement (weakness at lower and upper extremities was grade 2/5 and 3/5, respectively).

398222,Analysing the Relationship between University Students' Ecological Footprint and Their Connection with Nature and Pro-Environmental Attitude,2020,"The common occurrence of cardiovascular diseases and the lack of proper autologous tissues prompt and promote the pressing development of tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs). Current progress on scaffold production, genetically modified cells, and use of nanotechnology-based monitoring has considerably improved the long-term patency of engineered tissue grafts. However, challenges abound in the autologous materials and manipulation of genes and cells for tissue engineering. This review overviews current development in TEVGs and discusses recent improvements in scaffolding techniques and the efficiency of gene-editing tools and their ability to fill the existing gaps in stem cell and regenerative therapies. Current advances in three-dimensional printing approaches for fabrication of engineered tissues are also reviewed together with specific biomaterials for vascular tissues. In addition, the natural and synthetic polymers that hold increasing significance for vascular tissue engineering are highlighted. Both animal models and nanotechnology-based monitoring are proposed for preclinical evaluation of engineered grafts in view of their historical significance in tissue engineering. The ultimate success of tissue regeneration, which is yet to be fully realized, depends on the optimal performance of culture systems, biomaterial constructs, and stem cells in a suitable artificial physiological environment. Impact statement The main goal of this review is to provide a broadened insight on recent advances in stem cell-based vascular tissue engineering and the development of gene-editing and nanotechnology systems in this field. Moreover, the uses of autologous cells to prepare personalized hydrogels offer promising methods for scaffold fabrication. These new approaches not only improve the efficacy of tissue-engineered vascular grafts, but also offer potential therapeutic options with long-term beneficial effects on patients.","Chen, Sin-Guang; Ugwu, Felix; Li, Wan-Chun; Caplice, Noel M; Petcu, Eugen; Yip, Shea Ping; Huang, Chien-Ling","Tiss. eng., Part B, Rev",,352

399527,Identifying Predictors of University Students' Wellbeing during the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Data-Driven Approach,2021,"Introduction: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created a sudden lack of ventilators DuplicAR R is a novel device that allows simultaneous and independent ventilation of two subjects with a single ventilator The aims of this study are (a) to determine the efficacy of DuplicAR R to independently regulate the peak and positive-end expiratory pressures in each subject, both under pressure-controlled ventilation and volume-controlled ventilation and (b) to determine the ventilation mode in which DuplicAR R presents the best performance and safety Materials and Methods: Two test lungs are connected to a single ventilator using DuplicAR R Three experimental stages are established: (1) two identical subjects, (2) two subjects with the same weight but different lung compliance, and (3) two subjects with different weights and lung compliances In each stage, the test lungs are ventilated in two ventilation modes The positive-end expiratory pressure requirements are increased successively in one of the subjects The goal is to achieve a tidal volume of 7 ml/kg for each subject in all different stages through manipulation of the ventilator and the DuplicAR R controllers Results: DuplicAR R allows adequate ventilation of two subjects with different weights and/or lung compliances and/or PEEP requirements This is achieved by adjusting the total tidal volume for both subjects (in volume-controlled ventilation) or the highest peak pressure needed (in pressure-controlled ventilation) along with the basal positive-end expiratory pressure on the ventilator and simultaneously manipulating the DuplicAR R controllers to decrease the tidal volume or the peak pressure in the subject that needs less and/or to increase the positive-end expiratory pressure in the subject that needs more While ventilatory goals can be achieved in any of the ventilation modes, DuplicAR R performs better in pressure-controlled ventilation, as changes experienced in the variables of one subject do not modify the other one Conclusions: DuplicAR R is an effective tool to manage the peak inspiratory pressure and the positive-end expiratory pressure independently in two subjects connected to a single ventilator The driving pressure can be adjusted to meet the requirements of subjects with different weights and lung compliances Pressure-controlled ventilation has advantages over volume-controlled ventilation and is therefore the recommended ventilation mode","Lugones, I.; Ramos, M.; Biancolini, M.

High-dimensional flow cytometric characterization of immune cell subsets was performed at admission, 30 systemic cytokines/chemokines levels were sequentially measured, thirteen endothelial markers were determined at admission and at the zenith of the cytokines. Computed tomography scans on admission were quantified for lung damage and hepatic steatosis (n = 23). Abnormal BMI (> 25) observed in 72.6% of patients, was associated with a higher rate of intensive care unit hospitalization (p = 0.044). SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia, peripheral immune cell subsets and cytokines/chemokines were similar among BMI groups. A significant association between inflammatory cytokines and liver, renal, and endothelial dysfunctions was observed only in patients with obesity (BMI > 30). In contrast, early signs of lung damage (ground-glass opacity) correlated with Th1/M1/inflammatory cytokines only in normal weight patients. Later lesions of pulmonary consolidation correlated with BMI but were independent of cytokine levels. Our study reveals distinct physiopathological mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with obesity that may have important clinical implications.","Dragon-Durey, Marie-Agnès; Chen, Xiaoyi; Kirilovsky, Amos; Ben Hamouda, Nadine; El Sissy, Carine; Russick, Jules; Charpentier, Etienne; Binois, Yannick; Marliot, Florence; Meylan, Maxime; Granier, Clémence; Pere, Hélène; Saldmann, Antonin; Rance, Bastien; Jannot, Anne Sophie; Baron, Stéphanie; Chebbi, Mouna; Fayol, Antoine; Josseaume, Nathalie; Rives-Lange, Claire; Tharaux, Pierre-Louis; Cholley, Bernard; Diehl, Jean-Luc; Arlet, Jean-Benoît; Azizi, Michel; Karras, Alexandre; Czernichow, Sébastien; Smadja, David M; Hulot, Jean-Sébastien; Cremer, Isabelle; Tartour, Eric; Mousseaux, Elie; Pagès, Franck",PLoS One,,352

METHODS: Clinical and CT imaging data of 43 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in our hospital and the cooperative hospital between January 15-30, 2020 were collected (27 male and 16 female). Patients were classified as common type (26 cases, 60%), severe type (14 cases, 33%) or critical type (three cases, 7%) according to the new coronavirus pneumonia treatment scheme (sixth edition). Patient clinical data and CT images were analyzed and evaluated. RESULTS: Fever was the main symptom in common type COVID-19 cases (23/26, 88.46%). Both severe and critical type COVID-19 patients had fever and cough symptoms, and dyspnea was observed in all three critical COVID-19 patients. CT manifestations in the common type COVID-19 cohort were bilateral involvement (20/26, 71%), multiple lesions (14/26, 54%), ground-glass density shadow (17/26, 65%), and some cases were accompanied by local consolidation (9/26, 35%), which is consistent with early stage COVID-19 CT performance. CT manifestations in the severe and critical types involved both lungs. Severe COVID-19 cases predominantly consisted of multiple mixed-density lesions (10/14, 71%), and a few patients showed diffuse lung glass density shadows in both lungs (4/14, 29%), which is consistent with the progression stage COVID-19 CT performance. Critical COVID-19 cases exhibited mixed-density lesions, and two cases displayed ""white lung"", which is the CT manifestation at the severe COVID-19 stage. Only one critical COVID-19 patient had pleural effusion. CONCLUSIONS: The CT manifestations of COVID-19 are specific and there are variations between different clinical types. Thus, CT is an important clinical tool for early diagnosis and assessment of the severity of COVID-19.","Li, Xue-Ying; Zhou, Yang; Kong, Zi-Xuan; Hou, Mei-Dan; Luo, Ning; Sun, Wei-Hang; Huang, Nan; Yang, Chao; Zhang, Ao-Dan; Li, Yu-Shi",Ann. palliat. med.

403206,Statistical Estimation of Effects of Implemented Government Policies on COVID-19 Situation in South Korea,2021,"The systematic identification of infected individuals is critical for the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, the spread of the disease is mostly quantified by the reported numbers of infections, hospitalisations, recoveries and deaths; these quantities inform epidemiology models that provide forecasts for the spread of the epidemic and guide policy making. The veracity of these forecasts depends on the discrepancy between the numbers of reported, and unreported yet infectious, individuals. We combine Bayesian experimental design with an epidemiology model and propose a methodology for the optimal allocation of limited testing resources in space and time, which maximises the information gain for such unreported infections. The proposed approach is applicable at the onset and spread of the epidemic and can forewarn of a possible recurrence of the disease after relaxation of interventions. We examine its application in Switzerland; the open source software is, however, readily adaptable to countries around the world. We find that following the proposed methodology can lead to vastly less uncertain predictions for the spread of the disease, thus improving estimates of the effective reproduction number and the future number of unreported infections. This information can provide timely and systematic guidance for the effective identification of infectious individuals and for decision-making regarding lockdown measures and the distribution of vaccines.","Chatzimanolakis, Michail; Weber, Pascal; Arampatzis, Georgios; Wälchli, Daniel; Kicic, Ivica; Karnakov, Petr; Papadimitriou, Costas; Koumoutsakos, Petros",Swiss Med Wkly,,352

With the purpose of gradually replacing the use of plastics in cosmetic products (primary microplastics), the use of paraffin in microspheres has recently been applied. Paraffin waxes are composed by organic molecules usually derived from petroleum, thus assumed to be chemically and biologically inert, having a lower (eco)toxicity and residence time compared with plastic particles. However, the low ecotoxicity of paraffin waxes may be somewhat questionable, because some paraffin constituents can be absorbed and catabolized, thus exerting biological effects. The main objective of this study was to understand the potential toxic effects of paraffin microparticles on key physiological processes of the polychaete Hediste diversicolor. To attain this objective, this work assessed the acute and chronic effects of three densities (5, 20, and 80 mg L-1) of four size ranges of paraffin particles (from 100 to 1200 µm) on this epibenthic organism. Although paraffin wax can be generically considered innocuous, the present study was able to demonstrate a significant inhibition in the activity of acetylcholinesterase in acutely exposed organisms and an increase in the activity of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione S-transferase under some specific scenarios.","Gomes, Ana Sofia; Castro, Bruno B; Nunes, Bruno",,,352

Understanding the genetic mechanisms of immune response to viral infection provides insight into disease etiology and therapeutic opportunities. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive study including genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association analyses to identify genetic loci associated with immunoglobulin G antibody response to 28 antigens for 16 viruses using serological data from 7924 European ancestry participants in the UK Biobank cohort. RESULTS: Signals in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region dominated the landscape of viral antibody response, with 40 independent loci and 14 independent classical alleles, 7 of which exhibited pleiotropic effects across viral families. We identified specific amino acid (AA) residues that are associated with seroreactivity, the strongest associations presented in a range of AA positions within DRß1 at positions 11, 13, 71, and 74 for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Varicella zoster virus (VZV), human herpesvirus 7, (HHV7), and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV). Genome-wide association analyses discovered 7 novel genetic loci outside the HLA associated with viral antibody response (P < 5.0 × 10-8), including FUT2 (19q13.33) for human polyomavirus BK (BKV), STING1 (5q31.2) for MCV, and CXCR5 (11q23.3) and TBKBP1 (17q21.32) for HHV7. Transcriptome-wide association analyses identified 114 genes associated with response to viral infection, 12 outside of the HLA region, including ECSCR: P = 5.0 × 10-15 (MCV), NTN5: P = 1.1 × 10-9 (BKV), and P2RY13: P = 1.1 × 10-8 EBV nuclear antigen. We also demonstrated pleiotropy between viral response genes and complex diseases, from autoimmune disorders to cancer to neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the importance of the HLA region in host response to viral infection and elucidates novel genetic determinants beyond the HLA that contribute to host-virus interaction.","Kachuri, Linda; Francis, Stephen S; Morrison, Maike L; Wendt, George A; Bossé, Yohan; Cavazos, Taylor B; Rashkin, Sara R; Ziv, Elad; Witte, John S",Genome Med,,352

Qualitative studies exploring the experiences of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic have mainly focused on secondary care. AIM: To understand the experiences of European PCPs working during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING: An exploratory qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews in primary care in England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Greece and Sweden, between April and July 2020. METHOD: Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using a combination of inductive and deductive thematic analysis techniques. RESULTS: Eighty interviews were conducted with PCPs. PCPs had to make their own decisions on how to rapidly transform services in relation to COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care. Despite being overwhelmed with guidance, they often lacked access to practical training. Consequently, PCPs turned to their colleagues for moral support and information to try to quickly adjust to new ways of working, including remote care, and deal with uncertainty. CONCLUSION: PCPs rapidly transformed primary care delivery despite a number of challenges. Representation of primary care at policy level and engagement with local primary care champions will facilitate easy and coordinated access to practical information on how to adapt services, ongoing training and access to appropriate mental health support services for PCPs. Preservation of autonomy and responsiveness of primary care are critical to preserve the ability for rapid transformation in any future crisis of care delivery.","Wanat, Marta; Hoste, Melanie; Gobat, Nina; Anastasaki, Marilena; Boehmer, Femke; Chlabicz, Slawomir; Colliers, Annelies; Farrell, Karen; Karkana, Maria-Nefeli; Kinsman, John; Lionis, Christos; Marcinowicz, Ludmila; Reinhardt, Katrin; Skoglund, Ingmarie; Sundvall, Pär-Daniel; Vellinga, Akke; Verheij, Theo; Goossens, Herman; Butler, Christopher; van der Velden, Alike; Anthierens, Sibyl; Tonkin-Crine, Sarah",Br.j.gen.pract,,352

The countries considered are: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The data used are collected from a database of Johns Hopkins University, an institution that is dedicated to sensing and monitoring the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. A statistical analysis, based on principal components with modern and recent techniques, is conducted. Initially, utilizing the correlation matrix, standard components and varimax rotations are calculated. Then, by using disjoint components and functional components, the countries are grouped. An algorithm that allows us to keep the principal component analysis updated with a sensor in the data warehouse is designed.

413809,Evaluation of the Risk of Anxiety and/or Depression during Confinement Due to COVID-19 in Central Spain,2021,"COVID-19 home confinement has led to a stressful situation for children around the world and affected their lifestyle. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of these restrictions on sleep quality, screen time (ST) and physical activity (PA) in Tunisian children with a special focus on gender differences. An online survey was launched in April 2020. Questions were presented in a differential format, with expected responses related to ""before"" and ""during"" confinement. Participants (52 boys and 48 girls, age: 8.66 ± 3.3 years) responded to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the digital media use, and the Ricci and Gagnon sedentary behavior questionnaires. Findings revealed that COVID19 home confinement had a negative effect on all the considered parameters (p < 0.05). Significant effects of gender were found on sleep disturbances (p = 0.016, np2 = 0.05), subjective sleep quality (p < 0.01, np2 = 0.07), global score of PSQI (p = 0.01, np2 = 0.01) and nocturnal and global screen time (p < 0.001, np2 = 0.09) with poorer sleep and higher screen time in girls compared to boys during home confinement. A significant correlation was shown between Global ST and PSQI score (r = 0.39, p < 0.001). Programs of PA for children and sensitization campaigns against the use of screens have been deemed urgent with special focus oriented to girls.","Abid, Rihab; Ammar, Achraf; Maaloul, Rami; Souissi, Nizar; Hammouda, Omar",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,352

In challenge with this pandemic quarantine technique has been used widely after tens of years. In the course of the pandemic, many countries evacuated their citizens from affected regions and combined the evacuation with quarantine process. Some examples of these countries who evacuated their citizens are Germany, Italy, Spain, and USA. In further times, during the course of pandemic, according to spread, other countries evacuated their citizens from these countries too. Despite being the origin of the pandemic, in later times Wuhan was also a place where people were evacuated to. Evacuation and quarantine have caused social and psychological impacts on people and some of them took place in mainstream media. In this review article, evacuation and quarantine processes as well as the society's reactions to these, have been compiled.","Sencan, Irfan; Kuzi, Semanur",Turk J Med Sci,,352

414589,"Time for 'Green' during COVID-19? Inequities in Green and Blue Space Access, Visitation and Felt Benefits",2021,"BACKGROUND: Chemokine levels in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have been shown to be markedly elevated. But the role of chemokines in mild COVID-19 has not yet been established. According to the epidemiological statistics, most of the COVID-19 cases in Shiyan City, China, have been mild. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of chemokines in mild COVID-19 patients and explore the correlation between chemokines and host immune response. METHODS: In this study, we used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect serum levels of chemokines in COVID-19 patients in Shiyan City. Expression of chemokine receptors and of other signaling molecules was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We first demonstrated that COVID-19 patients, both sever and mild cases, are characterized by higher level of chemokines. Specifically, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) is expressed at higher levels both in severe and mild cases of COVID-19. The receptor of MCP-1, C-C chemokine receptor type 2, was expressed at higher levels in mild COVID-19 patients. Finally, we observed a significant negative correlation between expression levels of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and serum levels of MCP-1 in mild COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Higher expression of MCP-1 in mild COVID-19 patients might be correlated with inhibition of IFN signaling. The finding adds to our understanding of the immunopathological mechanisms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and provides potential therapeutic targets and strategies.","Xi, Xueyan; Guo, Yang; Zhu, Min; Wei, Yuhui; Li, Gang; Du, Boyu; Wang, Yunfu",Virol J,,352

415476,Hemodynamic Response to Three Types of Urban Spaces before and after Lockdown during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxation has emerged as a priority policy for promoting health and funding investments in communities most affected by diet-related disease. There are now 8 U.S. jurisdictions and over 40 countries that have implemented SSB taxes. Evaluations show that these policies reduce SSB consumption and purchasing while raising revenues to fund public health, education, and equity. However, there have been few analyses of the ethical considerations of SSB taxation. Using a framework for evaluating the ethics of public health interventions, this paper considers the ethical aspects of SSB excise taxes with respect to: physical health, psychosocial well-being, equality, informed choice, liberty, social and cultural values, and responsibility. Available evidence suggests there is a strong ethical case for levying SSB excise taxes on manufacturers and distributors. SSB excise taxes reduce consumption and purchasing of SSBs and are expected to meaningfully reduce obesity and diet-related morbidity and mortality. Because SSB taxes are specific to a product and its manufacturers, they are unlikely to harm psychosocial health by stigmatizing people who are overweight. SSB excise taxes should lead to greater equality because the health and social benefits are progressive (i.e., low-income individuals are likely to accrue the largest benefits from the tax, even more so when revenues are spent on health and social equity). Meanwhile, the average consumer cost burden that would result if distributors raise SSB prices in reponse to the tax is minimally regressive. Regarding liberty, SSB taxes do not eliminate the option of buying SSBs, but if SSB distributors raise SSB prices, it becomes somewhat more expensive to continue purchasing the same amount of SSBs. Meanwhile, the taxes expand beverage options by funding drinking water availability and prompting industry to expand offerings of unsweetened drinks and SSBs containing less sugar. Furthermore, by averting poor health, SSB taxes should expand overall freedom to pursue one's goals. Informed choice could be facilitated by seeing a higher SSB shelf price (which indicates a drink contains added sugar) and exposure to nutrition education funded with tax revenues. SSB taxation is unlikely to negatively interfere with social or cultural values because taxation would not eliminate having SSBs for special occasions, and SSBs are not a staple of traditional diets. Lastly, SSB taxation attributes responsibility for health in a manner that reflects industry's contribution to obesity and the multisectoral solutions that are needed to prevent diet-related disease.","Falbe, Jennifer",Physiol Behav,,352
415654,Understanding COVID-19: From Origin to Potential Therapeutics,2020,"Introduction: Considering the global prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a vaccine is being developed to control the disease as a complementary solution to hygiene measures-and better, in social terms, than social distancing. Given that a vaccine will eventually be produced, information will be needed to support a potential campaign to promote vaccination. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the variables affecting the likelihood of refusal and indecision toward a vaccine against COVID-19 and to determine the acceptance of the vaccine for different scenarios of effectiveness and side effects. Materials and Methods: A multinomial logistic regression method based on the Health Belief Model was used to estimate the current methodology, using data obtained by an online anonymous survey of 370 respondents in Chile. Results: The results indicate that 49% of respondents were willing to be vaccinated, with 28% undecided or 77% of individuals who would potentially be willing to be inoculated. The main variables that explained the probability of rejection or indecision were associated with the severity of COVID-19, such as, the side effects and effectiveness of the vaccine; perceived benefits, including immunity, decreased fear of contagion, and the protection of oneself and the environment; action signals, such as, responses from ones' family and the government, available information, and specialists' recommendations; and susceptibility, including the contagion rate per 1,000 inhabitants and relatives with COVID-19, among others. Our analysis of hypothetical vaccine scenarios revealed that individuals preferred less risky vaccines in terms of fewer side effects, rather than effectiveness. Additionally, the variables that explained the indecision toward or rejection of a potential COVID-19 vaccine could be used in designing public health policies. Conclusions: We discovered that it is necessary to formulate specific, differentiated vaccination-promotion strategies for the anti-vaccine and undecided groups based on the factors that explain the probability of individuals refusing or expressing hesitation toward vaccination.","Cerda, Arcadio A; García, Leidy Y",Front Public Health,,352

In this study, we determined the kinetics of viral loads, antibody responses (IgM, IgG, neutralization) and SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells by quantifying these parameters in 435 serial respiratory and blood samples collected from a cohort of 29 COVID-19 patients with either moderate or severe disease during the whole period of hospitalization or until death. Remarkably, there was no significant difference in the kinetics and plateau levels of neutralizing antibodies among the groups with different disease severity. In contrast, the dynamics of specific CD4 T cell responses differed considerably, but all patients with moderate or severe disease developed robust SARS-CoV-2-specific responses. Of note, none of the patients had detectable cross-reactive CD4 T cells in the first week after symptom onset, which have been described in 20-50% of unexposed individuals. Our data thus provide novel insights into the kinetics of antibody and CD4 T cell responses as well as viral loads that are key to understanding the role of adaptive immunity in combating the virus during acute infection and provide leads for the timing of immune therapies for COVID-19.","Koblischke, Maximilian; Traugott, Marianna T; Medits, Iris; Spitzer, Felicia S; Zoufaly, Alexander; Weseslindtner, Lukas; Simonitsch, Cara; Seitz, Tamara; Hoepler, Wolfgang; Puchhammer-Stöckl, Elisabeth; Aberle, Stephan W; Födinger, Manuela; Bergthaler, Andreas; Kundi, Michael; Heinz, Franz X; Stiasny, Karin; Aberle, Judith H",Front Med (Lausanne),,352

OBJECTIVES: To compare the prevalence and clinical characteristics of HE, and hand hygiene practices in HCWs working in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 units. METHODS: A total of 244 HCWs working in COVID-19 (n = 118) and non-COVID-19 patient care units (n = 126) were examined by dermatologists with regard to demographic parameters and hand hygiene practices. The COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups were matched at a 1:1 ratio according to age, atopy, and generalized dry skin. RESULTS: HE was more frequent in the COVID-19 group (48.3% vs 12.7%, P < .001), whereas working years (P < .05) and additional housework at home (P < .001) were longer in the non-COVID-19 group. After the development of HE, moisturizing creams were reported to be more frequently used in the COVID group (P < .001). Topical corticosteroids were used in a minority (40% in the COVID group and 26.7% in the non-COVID group). CONCLUSIONS: HCWs in COVID-19 units developed HE more frequently. A majority increased the frequency of moisturizer use, instead of using topical corticosteroids, after the development of HE for the purpose of treating eczema.

The results for both patients returned COVID-19 positive and the couple were transported to the Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital for isolated treatment by ambulance on April 16, 2021. Patient A had inflamed lungs while Patient B had mild inflammation in her lungs according to the chest computed tomography (CT) examination. Both of their 28 close contacts underwent centralized isolation and medical observation. On April 21, 2021, Guangdong Provincial CDC received the samples and began virus isolation and gene sequencing analysis. On April 27, 2021, the 2 samples were sequenced using Nanopore GridION. On April 30, 2021, the sequencing analysis concluded that the 2 virus genomes belonged to lineage P.1, 20J/501Y.V3, which was first found in four Brazilians after a routine check at Japan’s Haneda airport in late December 2020. The variant was then widely spread to Manaus in the northern State of Amazona in Brazil. The Brazil variant has been reported in 40 different countries as of April 30, 2021(1).

Both variants have 12 mutations to the spike protein, including 3 mutations of concern in common with 20H/501Y.V2 (K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y) which may affect transmissibility and host immune response (4-5). The P.1 lineage and the B.1.1.7 first described in the United Kingdom share the spike N501Y mutation and a deletion in ORF1b (del 3675-3677 SGF).

Both the P.1 and the B.1.351 lineage also have the ORF1b deletion (del 3675-3677 SGF) (6). This is the fourth recent detection of a major international variant following the detection of the United Kingdom 501Y.V1 variant, the South African 501Y.V2 variant, and the Nigerian B.1.525 variant in Guangdong (7-9).

423724,The Prevention and Management of COVID-19: Seeking a Practical and Timely Solution,2020,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is considered an important risk factor for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The commonly anti-hypertensive drugs are the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and beta-blockers. The association between commonly used anti-hypertensive medications and the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients with hypertension has not been well studied. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study that included all patients admitted with COVID-19 to Huo Shen Shan Hospital and Guanggu District of the Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province, Wuhan, China. Clinical and laboratory characteristics were extracted from electronic medical records. Hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatment were confirmed by medical history and clinical records. The primary clinical endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included the rates of patients in common wards transferred to the intensive care unit and hospital stay duration. Logistic regression was used to explore the risk factors associated with mortality and prognosis. Propensity score matching was used to balance the confounders between different anti-hypertensive treatments. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare the cumulative recovery rate. Log-rank tests were performed to test for differences in Kaplan-Meier curves between different groups. RESULTS: Among 4569 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 31.7% (1449/4569) had a history of hypertension. There were significant differences in mortality rates between hypertensive patients with CCBs (7/359) and those without (21/359) (1.95% vs. 5.85%, risk ratio [RR]: 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13-0.76, &#967;2â=â7.61, Pâ=â0.0058). After matching for confounders, the mortality rates were similar between the RAAS inhibitor (4/236) and non-RAAS inhibitor (9/236) cohorts (1.69% vs. 3.81%, RR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.13-1.43, &#967;2â=â1.98, Pâ=â0.1596).

This study sought to examine the associations of daily average temperature (AT) and relative humidity (ARH) with the percent increase in COVID-19 cases. Methods: Daily confirmed cases and meteorological factors in 38 districts of India were collected between 1st April 2020 to 30th April 2020. Taking a 5-day time lag of average values of the variables and multiple days-samples, we ran multiple models and performed appropriate hypothesis tests to decide the single preferred model for each sample data. Suitable fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) models with cluster-robust standard errors were applied to quantify the district-specific associations of meteorological and other variables with COVID-19 cases. Results: All FE models revealed that every one-degree rise in AT led to a decrease in 3.909 points (on average) in percent increase in COVID-19 cases. All RE models showed that with one unit increase in the malaria annual parasite index, there was a significant increase in 10.835 points (on average) in percent increase in COVID-19 cases. In both FE and RE models, ARH was found to be negatively associated with a percent increase in COVID-19 cases, although in half of these models the association was statistically insignificant. Conclusion: Our results indicate that mean temperature, mean relative humidity, and malaria endemicity might have an essential role in the stability and transmissibility of the 2019 novel coronavirus.","Panigrahi, Ansuman; Mohapatra, Ipsa; Kanyari, S Suneeti; Maharana, Sabita; Panigrahi, Madhulita",Arch Environ Occup Health,,352

Operating under the Northern Virginia Emergency Medical Services Council, Ashes2Art provides art supplies, art classes, and a creative community of support to mitigate the deleterious effects the stress of the job can take on fire fighters and first responders' health and mental health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ashes2Art has seen an increased demand for art supplies and the, now online, creative arts classes and self-care strategies. Currently, approximately 100 emergency services personnel and family members are actively participating in these initiatives during this crisis. Managing the cumulative emotional load these first responders and their families experience is paramount to COVID-19 recovery efforts and post-pandemic operations. Helping first responders and their families manage the short- and long-term emotional toll from the work they do in responding to the COVID-19 crisis is paramount to the United States' successful recovery back to a well-functioning post-pandemic society.

432050,A Transdisciplinary Analysis of COVID-19 in Italy: The Most Affected Country in Europe,2020,"The replication transcription complex (RTC) from the virus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for recognizing and processing RNA for two principal purposes. The RTC copies viral RNA for propagation into new virus and for ribosomal transcription of viral proteins. To accomplish these activities, the RTC mechanism must also conform to a large number of imperatives, including RNA over DNA base recognition, basepairing, distinguishing viral and host RNA, production of mRNA that conforms to host ribosome conventions, interfacing with error checking machinery, and evading host immune responses. In addition, the RTC will discontinuously transcribe specific sections of viral RNA to amplify certain proteins over others. Central to SARS-CoV-2 viability, the RTC is therefore dynamic and sophisticated. We have conducted a systematic structural investigation of three components that make up the RTC: Nsp7, Nsp8, and Nsp12 (also known as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). We have solved high-resolution crystal structures of the Nsp7/8 complex, providing insight into the interaction between the proteins. We have used small-angle x-ray and neutron solution scattering (SAXS and SANS) on each component individually as pairs and higher-order complexes and with and without RNA. Using size exclusion chromatography and multiangle light scattering-coupled SAXS, we defined which combination of components forms transient or stable complexes. We used contrast-matching to mask specific complex-forming components to test whether components change conformation upon complexation. Altogether, we find that individual Nsp7, Nsp8, and Nsp12 structures vary based on whether other proteins in their complex are present. Combining our crystal structure, atomic coordinates reported elsewhere, SAXS, SANS, and other biophysical techniques, we provide greater insight into the RTC assembly, mechanism, and potential avenues for disruption of the complex and its functions.","Wilamowski, Mateusz; Hammel, Michal; Leite, Wellington; Zhang, Qiu; Kim, Youngchang; Weiss, Kevin L; Jedrzejczak, Robert; Rosenberg, Daniel J; Fan, Yichong; Wower, Jacek; Bierma, Jan C; Sarker, Altaf H; Tsutakawa, Susan E; Pingali, Sai Venkatesh; O039,; Neill, Hugh M; Joachimiak, Andrzej; Hura, Greg L",Biophys J,,352

435652,COVID-19 and Pediatric Asthma: Clinical and Management Challenges,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide an update on immunomodulating and immunosuppressive therapies in myasthenia gravis and highlight newly approved, or pending approval, therapies with new biologics. RECENT FINDINGS: Preoperative IVIg is not needed to prevent myasthenic crisis in stable myasthenia gravis patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia, based on controlled data. Rituximab, if initiated early in new-onset myasthenia gravis, can lead to faster and more sustained remission even without immunotherapies in 35% of patients at 2 years. Biomarkers determining the timing for follow-up infusions in Rituximab-responding AChR-positive patients are discussed. Most patients with MuSK-positive myasthenia gravis treated with Rituximab have sustained long-term remission with persistent reduction of IgG4 anti-MuSK antibodies. Eculizumb in the extension REGAIN study showed sustained long-term pharmacological remissions and reduced exacerbations. Three new biologic agents showed promising results in phase-II controlled myasthenia gravis trials: Zilucoplan, a subcutaneous macrocyclic peptide inhibiting complement C5; Efgartigimod, an IgG1-derived Fc fragment binding to neonatal FcRn receptor; and Rozanolixizumab, a high-affinity anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody. Finally, the safety of ongoing myasthenia gravis immunotherapies during COVID19 pandemic is discussed. SUMMARY: New biologics against B cells, complement and FcRn receptor, are bringing us closer to successful targeted immunotherapies in the chronic management of myasthenia gravis promising an exciting future for antibody-mediated neurological diseases.","Dalakas, Marinos C",Curr Opin Neurol,,352

Many drugs have therapeutic potential. The aminoquinolones, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine are undergoing evaluation as a potential therapy against COVID -19. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that these drugs affect viral adherence and modify inflammatory responses, which may provide some impact on the symptoms associated with COVID. As palliative care specialists encounter more COVID positive patients, palliative care specialists need to know how these drugs work, and importantly how they interact with palliative care drugs used for symptom control. At the same time, there is a need to reduce polypharmacy in any seriously ill patient population. The goals of this paper are to identify whether or not hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine improves symptoms in palliative care patients and whether or not these drugs are safe to use in the advanced illness population who have COVID.","Prommer, Eric",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,,352

However, the clinical relevance of &#945;-l-fucosidase, the enzyme for defucosylation has not been discovered. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 585 COVID-19 patients were included to analyze the correlations of &#945;-l-fucosidase activity with the nucleic acid test, IgM/IgG, comorbidities, and disease progression. RESULTS: Among the COVID-19 patients, 5.75% were double-negative for nucleic acid and antibodies. All of them had increased &#945;-l-fucosidase, while only one had abnormal serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The abnormal rate of &#945;-l-fucosidase was 81.82% before the presence of IgM, 100% in the presence of IgM, and 66.2% in the presence of IgG. 73.42% of patients with glucometabolic disorders had increased &#945;-l-fucosidase activity and had the highest mortality of 6.33%. The increased &#945;-l-fucosidase was observed in 55.8% of non-severe cases and 72.9% of severe cases, with an odds ratio of 2.118. The &#945;-l-fucosidase mRNA was irrelevant to its serum activity. CONCLUSION: The change in &#945;-l-fucosidase activity in COVID-19 preceded the IgM and SAA and showed a preferable relation with glucometabolic disorders, which may be conducive to virus invasion or invoke an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.","Liang, En-Yu; Li, Guo-Hua; Wang, Wen-Gong; Qiu, Xin-Min; Ke, Pei-Feng; He, Min; Huang, Xian-Zhang",Clin Chim Acta,,352

And women constitute 90% of the research team working on the Center's largest current project-unlocking the biological secrets of COVID-19 in the Cuban population. They are identifying particularly vulnerable groups and geographies, reviewing therapies applied and long-term sequelae of the disease, and contributing to ongoing vaccine research and trials. Their results are critical to determining effective preventive and treatment strategies as the country moves into the next phases of epidemic control. The national study is the first and only one of its kind in Latin America. Then the first COVID-19 cases were diagnosed in Cuba on March 11, 2020, the Center's role in epidemiological surveillance was activated, based on its experience with the Zika threat in 2015. This involved mobilizing the National Genetics Network anchored in primary healthcare facilities, comprised of 452 genetics counselors, nurses and clinical geneticists, supported by technicians, epidemiologists and family doctors. The Network's role would become key to the ensuing research. As the magnitude of the pandemic became clearer, CNGM investigators approached the Ministry of Public Health and government leaders with a broad-ranging proposal to study biological factors that would help explain differences in vulnerability, symptoms, immune response and severity of the disease, as well as its profile in different Cuban subpopulations. After approval, the studies got underway in June, encompassing Cubans who had been infected through June 11, 2020, and were by now convalescing. The nine main research lines were defined, and principal investigators went to work developing the instruments needed and training personnel across the island on their use.

Findings from statistical analyses demonstrated the significant associations among research variables, and identified the mediating nature of FSC love and FSC respect. In addition, the important moderating effect of perceived FSC ticket price was found. A prominent role of ambient condition quality in eliciting approach behaviors was also explored. Overall, our theoretical framework contained a prediction power for approach behaviors. The research findings thus assist FSC researchers and practitioners to better understand the process of generating the customer decision-making process and behaviors that are positive for full service carriers.

Methods: This case series included 27 consecutive laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted in a tertiary care ICU over 14 days period, followed up till their discharge from ICU. Demographic and clinical data, including laboratory and radiological findings, were compiled with special attention to co-morbidities of the patients. The management of these patients was done as per the institutional protocol for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Results: The median age of the patients was 50 years with no difference in gender. Comorbid conditions were seen in 85% of the patients with diabetes (43.7%) and hypertension (37.5%) as the most common conditions. The median duration of symptoms before admission was 6 days with fever as the most common clinical symptom at presentation. Chest roentogram showed bilateral lung infiltrates in 88.8% of the patients. Mild, moderate, and severe hypoxia were observed in 3, 8, and 16 patients, respectively. Ten patients were managed with oxygen therapy. Seventeen patients (62.9%) required ventilatory support. Mortality rate among patients admitted to our ICU was 59.2%. Conclusions: This case series shows middle-aged patients with comorbid diseases present with severe COVID-19 disease and have poor outcome.","Pande, DImple; Kochhar, Anjali; Saini, Suman; Ganapathy, Usha; Gogia, Anoop",Indian J.

The impact of these interventions on trauma and emergency general surgery patient volume has not yet been described. METHODS: We compared trauma admissions and emergency general surgery (EGS) cases between February 1-April 14 from 2017-2020 in five two-week time periods. Data were compared across time periods with Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: There were significant decreases in overall trauma admissions (57.4% decrease, p<0.001); motor vehicle collisions (MVC) (80.5% decrease, p<0.001); and non-MVCs (45.1% decrease, p<0.001) from February-April 2020. We found no significant change in EGS cases (p = 0.70). Nor was there was a significant change in trauma cases in any other year 2017-2019. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic's burden of disease correlated with a significant decrease in trauma admissions, with MVCs experiencing a larger decrease than non-MVCs.","Kamine, Tovy H; Rembisz, Adam; Barron, Rebecca J; Baldwin, Carey; Kromer, Mark",West J Emerg Med,,352

445500,Socioeconomic Conditioning of the Development of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Global Spatial Differentiation,2021,"As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many events have been interrupted, but young child development has not. This rapid review of the literature explores some of the potential impacts of the pandemic on young children, early childhood education and care (ECEC) and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 (United Nations 2015). In times of crises, ECEC can play a critical role in keeping children, healthy and safe, while promoting the foundations for lifelong learning and wellbeing. Yet, with the closure of schools as one of the measures to control the spread of the virus, many opportunities for learning and development in these formative years will be missed. This will cause major issues especially for vulnerable children. The pandemic also has long-lasting impacts on child development, lifelong learning opportunities, as well as economic and human capital. It also has implications on the progress towards SDG 4 (United Nations 2015), which had already fallen behind before the crisis. While it is impossible to say at this point how long the crisis will last, if school closure and the COVID-19 pandemic were to last into the next academic year, there will be enormous losses for young children, with implications for human and economic capital. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Spiteri, J.",World Sustainability Series,,352

Long term immunosuppressive treatment may be required to minimize the consequences of the disease. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we investigated the efficacy of rituximab (RTX) in MMP patients and compare the beneficial effects of early versus late administration of RTX. Medical records of 24 MMP patients who were treated with 500 mg RTX on day 1, then weekly for 4 consecutive weeks were reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (87.5%) reached disease control (DC) at the mean interval of 4.95 months (SD: 5.15; range: 1-24) after RTX. Complete remission (CR) with scarring was achieved in 45.8% (n = 11) and 33.3% (n = 8) attained CR without any residual scar (total CR with or without scar 79.1%). Two patients (8.3%) reached partial remission including persistent gingivitis. Only one patient progressed from non-cicatricial to cicatricial MMP despite receiving RTX. 47.6% (n = 10) of patients experienced relapse after achieving DC at a mean interval of 15.2 months (range: 6-30, SD: 7.0). Considerably, earlier the RTX was administered, sooner the DC was obtained (Pearson r = 0.742, p-value < .001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that RTX may prevent further scarring and progression in MMP patients especially if administered early.","Amir Dastmalchi, Delara; Moslemkhani, Solmaz; Bayat, Maryam; Balighi, Kamran; Abedini, Robabeh; Mahmoudi, Hamidreza; Daneshpazhooh, Maryam",J Dermatolog Treat,,352

However, the safety and efficacy of the technique for obtaining human olfactory epithelium are still not fully established. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of harvesting olfactory epithelium cells, nerve bundles, and olfactory epithelium proper for morphological analysis from the superior nasal septum. METHODS: During nasal surgery, 22 individuals without olfactory complaints underwent olfactory epithelium biopsies from the superior nasal septum. The efficacy of obtaining olfactory epithelium, verification of intact olfactory epithelium and the presence of nerve bundles in biopsies were assessed using immunofluorescence. Safety for the olfactory function was tested psychophysically using both unilateral and bilateral tests before and 1 month after the operative procedure. RESULTS: Olfactory epithelium was found in 59.1% of the subjects. Of the samples, 50% were of the quality necessary for morphological characterization and 90.9% had nerve bundles. There was no difference in the psychophysical scores obtained in the bilateral olfactory test (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test [UPSIT®]) between means before biopsy: 32.3 vs. postoperative: 32.5, pâ¯=â¯0.81. Also, no significant decrease occurred in unilateral testing (mean unilateral test scores 6 vs. 6.2, pâ¯=â¯0.46). None out of the 56 different odorant identification significantly diminished (pâ¯>â¯0.05). CONCLUSION: The technique depicted for olfactory epithelium biopsy is highly effective in obtaining neuronal olfactory tissue, but it has moderate efficacy in achieving samples useful for morphological analysis. Olfactory sensitivity remained intact.","Garcia, Ellen Cristine Duarte; Luz, Lucas de Almeida; Anzolin, Lucas Kanieski; Barbosa da Silva, José Lucas; Doty, Richard L; Pinna, Fábio de Rezende; Voegels, Richard Louis; Fornazieri, Marco Aurélio",Braz. j. otorhinolaryngol.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 65% of the world population solely utilize botanical preparations as medicine. Due to the abundance of plants, plant-derived medicines are more readily accessible, affordable, convenient, and have safer side-effect profiles than synthetic drugs. Plant-based decoctions have been a significant part of Jamaican traditional folklore medicine.

450143,Stress and Anxiety Levels in Pregnant and Post-Partum Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have reported a correlation between coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and asthma. However, data on whether asthma constitutes a risk factor for COVID-19 and the prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 cases still remain scant. Here, we interrogated and analyzed the association between COVID-19 and asthma. METHODS: In this study, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for studies published between January 1 and August 28, 2020. We included studies that reported the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 and its prevalence in asthma patients. We excluded reviews, animal trials, single case reports, small case series and studies evaluating other coronavirus-related illnesses. Raw data from the studies were pooled into a meta-analysis. RESULTS: We analyzed findings from 18 studies, including asthma patients with COVID-19. The pooled prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 cases was 0.08 (95% CI, 0.06-0.11), with an overall I2 of 99.07%, p < 0.005. The data indicated that asthma did not increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 1.04 (95% CI, 0.75-1.46) p = 0.28; I2=20%). In addition, there was no significant difference in the incidence of asthma with age in COVID-19 infections [OR] 0.77(95% CI, 0.59-1.00) p = 0.24; I2=29%). CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data suggested that asthma is not a significant risk factor for the development of severe COVID-19.","Wu, Ting; Yu, Pengyi; Li, Yuanxia; Wang, Junxin; Li, Zhen; Qiu, Jingjing; Cui, Limei; Mou, Yakui; Sun, Yan",J Asthma,,352

Special care should be given to self-monitoring vital parameters such as blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), whose abnormal values are a warning sign for potential infection by COVID-19. Measurement of SpO2 is commonly made through the pulse oximeter that requires skin contact and hence could be a potential way of spreading contagious infections. For this reason, contact-less solutions for self-monitoring of SpO2 would be beneficial. In this paper we present a mHealth approach to self-monitor SpO2 that does not require any contact device since it is based on video processing. Video frames of the patient's face acquired by a camera are processed in real-time in order to extract the remote photoplethysmography signal useful to derive an estimation of SpO2. Preliminary experimental results show that the SpO2 values obtained by our contact-less solution are consistent with the measurements of a commercial pulse oximeter used as reference device.","Casalino, G.; Castellano, G.; Zaza, G.; Ieee,",2020 Ieee Symposium on Computers and Communications,,352

Moreover, the complications of renal failure, such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, appear to be a risk factor of death owing to novel coronavirus disease. The reported morbidity and mortality rates of novel coronavirus disease are significantly higher in dialysis patients than in the healthy population. No treatment for novel coronavirus disease has yet been developed; thus, countermeasures to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease in dialysis facilities must be rapidly established.

METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of trauma volume from Worcester Regional Hospital in South Africa from 1 January to 28 December 2020. We compared total volume and incidence rates during five calendar periods; one when alcohol sales were allowed as per normal and four when alcohol sales were completely or partially banned. Poisson regression was used to model differences between alcohol ban and non-ban periods. RESULTS: During the first period (pre-COVID-19, no ban), the trauma admission rate was 95 per 100 days, compared to 39 during the second period (complete ban 1), 74 during the third period (partial ban 1), 40 during the fourth period (complete ban 2) and 105 during the fifth period (partial ban 2). There was a 59-69% decrease in trauma volume between the no ban and complete ban 1 periods. When alcohol sales were partially reinstated, trauma volume significantly increased by 83-90% then dropped again by 39-46% with complete ban 2. By the second half of 2020, when alcohol sales were partially allowed again (partial ban 2), trauma volume increased by 163-250%, thus returning to pre-COVID-19 levels. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a clear trend of decreased trauma volume during periods of complete alcohol prohibition compared to non- and partial alcohol bans. This finding suggests that temporary alcohol bans can be used to decrease health facility traffic during national emergencies.","Chu, Kathryn M; Marco, Jenna-Lee; Owolabi, Eyitayo Omolara; Duvenage, Riaan; Londani, Mukhethwa; Lombard, Carl; Parry, Charles D H",Drug alcohol rev,,352
457806,COVID-19: Detecting Government Pandemic Measures and Public Concerns from Twitter Arabic Data Using Distributed Machine Learning,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus which caused the COVID-19 pandemic and infected more than 10 million victims and resulted in over 500,000 deaths in 213 countries around the world. Having no symptoms in the first week of infection increases the rate of spreading virus. This increasing rate and consequently increasing number of infected individuals necessitate an immediate development of proper diagnostic methods and effective treatments. To date, no specific treatment is detected for curing COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2, similar to other viruses, needs to interact with the host proteins to reach the host and replicate its genome. Accordingly, host-virus protein-protein interactions' (PPI) identification could be useful in predicting the behavior of virus and designing antiviral drugs. Identification of host-virus PPIs with experimental approaches are so time consumable, and so computational approaches are usually applied. In this study, we developed a new method to predict SARS-CoV-2-human PPIs. Our model is a three-layer network in which the first layer contains the most similar Alphainfluenzavirus proteins to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The second layer contains protein-protein interactions between Alphainfluenzavirus proteins and human proteins. The third layer reveals protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins by using the clustering coefficient network property on the two first layers. For further analysis on the results of our prediction network, we investigated human proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 proteins and report the most central human proteins in human PPI network. Moreover, differentially expressed genes of two available GSE were investigated and PPIs of SARS-CoV-2-human network, the human proteins of which were related to upregulated genes, were reported.","Khorsand, Babak; Savadi, Abdorreza; Naghibzadeh, Mahmoud",Inform Med Unlocked,,352

The virus infects the host by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. Due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the kidneys and gastrointestinal (GI) tract, kidneys and GI tract damage arising from the virus can be seen in patients and can cause acute conditions such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and digestive problems for the patient. One of the complications of kidneys and GI involvement in COVID-19 is fluid and electrolyte disturbances. The most common ones of these disorders are hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypochloremia, hypervolemia, and hypovolemia, which if left untreated, cause many problems for patients and even increase mortality. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances are more common in hospitalized and intensive care patients. Children are also at greater risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances complications. Therefore, clinicians should pay special attention to the fluid and electrolyte status of patients. Changes in fluid and electrolyte levels can be a good indicator of disease progression.","Pourfridoni, Mohammad; Abbasnia, Seyede Mahsa; Shafaei, Fateme; Razaviyan, Javad; Heidari-Soureshjani, Reza",Biomed Res Int,,352
460002,Intention to Take COVID-19 Vaccine as a Precondition for International Travel: Application of Extended Norm-Activation Model,2021,"Introduction Interferon (IFN) alpha (IFNα) and lambda3 (IFN?3) constitute the first line of immunity against viral infection by increasing expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Both are produced in SARS-CoV-2 infection and have been considered therapeutically in COVID-19. In epithelial cells IFNs have been shown to influence the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for S-protein (S1P) of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is part of the vascular renin angiotensin system and may be important in COVID-19-associated endotheliitis. Whether SP1 influences immune responses in endothelial cells unknown. We investigated effects of SP1 on ACE2 expression and immune responses in human endothelial cells. Methods Culturedhuman Microvascular, Lymphatic, Aortic and Pulmonary Endothelial Cells (MEC, LEC, AEC, and PEC respectively) were stimulated with SP1 of SARS-CoV-2 (1µg/106 cells), IFNα (100ng/mL) or IFN?3 (100IU/mL). Because ACE2, metalloproteinase domain 17 (ADAM17) and type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are important for SARS-CoV-2 infection, cells were treated with inhibitors of ADAM17 (marimastat, 3.8nM and TAPI-1, 100nM), ACE2 (MLN4760, 440pM), and TMPRSS2 (camostat, 50µM). Expression of ISGs (ISG15, IFIT1, and MX1) was investigated by real-time PCR (5h), cytokine by ELISA and protein expression by immunoblotting (24h). Results AEC, LEC, MEC, and PEC stimulated with SP1 exhibited increased expression of ISGs: ISG15 (1.9-2.3-fold), IFIT1 (2.0-7.9-fold), MX1 (3.1-5.8-fold), indicating activation of the IFN pathway. MEC and LEC exhibited higher responses to IFNα activation. MEC (ISG15: 16-fold, IFIT1: 21-fold, MX1: 31-fold) and LEC (ISG15: 48-fold, IFIT1: 105-fold, MX1: 134-fold). Only MEC exhibited ISG expression induced by IFN?3 (ISG15: 1.7-fold, IFIT1: 1.9-fold, MX1: 1.7-fold) (P&lt;0.05). IL-6 production was increased in MEC stimulated with IFNα (1230pg/mL) and IFN?3 (1124pg/mL) vs control (591pg/mL). Marimastat, but not camostat or MLN4760 inhibited SP1 effects. IFNα induced IL-6 production in AEC and PEC (178pg/mL vs control 109pg/mL). No changes in IL-6 were observed in LEC. IFNα increased expression of the short form of ACE2 (75kDa) (63%), ADAM17 (36%), and TMPRSS2 (65%) in MECs. This was associated with increased activation of pro-inflammatory pathways with increased phosphorylation of Stat1 (134%), Stat2 (102%), ERK1/2 (42%). IFN?3 also increased phosphorylation of Stat2 (60%) and ERK1/2 (75%). In MEC, phosphorylation of the eNOS activation motif Ser1177 was reduced by IFNLα and (40%) and IFN?3 (40%). Conclusions In human endothelial cells from multiple vascular beds, SP1, IFNα and IFN?3 induced an immune response characterised by increased ISG expression and IL-6 production, processes that involve ADAM17.

However, the mechanism whereby SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells remains poorly understood. Here we used SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses to infect human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing HEK293T cells and evaluated virus infection. We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 entry was dependent on ACE2 and sensitive to pH of endosome/lysosome in HEK293T cells. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses is independent of dynamin, clathrin, caveolin and endophilin A2, as well as macropinocytosis. Instead, we found that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses was cholesterol-rich lipid raft dependent. Cholesterol depletion of cell membranes with methyl-ß-cyclodextrin resulted in reduction of pseudovirus infection. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses resumed with cholesterol supplementation. Together, cholesterol-rich lipid rafts, and endosomal acidification, are key steps of SARS-CoV-2 required for infection of host cells. Therefore, our finding expands the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanism and provides a new anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategy.","Li, Xiaowei; Zhu, Wenhua; Fan, Meiyang; Zhang, Jing; Peng, Yizhao; Huang, Fumeng; Wang, Nan; He, Langchong; Zhang, Lei; Holmdahl, Rikard; Meng, Liesu; Lu, Shemin",,,352
461692,Environmental Preferences and Concerns of Recreational Road Runners,2021,"Nowadays, live video streaming events have become a mainstay in viewer's communication in large international enterprises. Provided that viewers are distributed worldwide, the main challenge resides on how to schedule the optimal event's time so as to improve both the viewer's engagement and adoption. In this paper we present a multi-task deep reinforcement learning model to select the time of a live video streaming event, aiming to optimize the viewer's engagement and adoption at the same time. We consider the engagement and adoption of the viewers as independent tasks and formulate a unified loss function to learn a common policy. In addition, we account for the fact that each task might have different contribution to the training strategy of the agent. Therefore, to determine the contribution of each task to the agent's training, we design a Transformer's architecture for the state-action transitions of each task. We evaluate our proposed model on four real-world datasets, generated by the live video streaming events of four large enterprises spanning from January 2019 until March 2021. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model when compared with several state-of-the-art strategies.

Opinion surveys identified importance of political ideology in shaping perceptions of the pandemic and compliance with preventive measures. Here, we use social media data to study complexity of polarization. We analyze a large dataset of tweets related to the pandemic collected between January and May of 2020, and develop methods to classify the ideological alignment of users along the moderacy (hardline vs moderate), political (liberal vs conservative) and science (anti-science vs pro-science) dimensions. While polarization along the science and political dimensions are correlated, politically moderate users are more likely to be aligned with the pro-science views, and politically hardline users with anti-science views. Contrary to expectations, we do not find that polarization grows over time; instead, we see increasing activity by moderate pro-science users. We also show that anti-science conservatives tend to tweet from the Southern US, while anti-science moderates from the Western states. Our findings shed light on the multi-dimensional nature of polarization, and the feasibility of tracking polarized opinions about the pandemic across time and space through social media data.","Rao, Ashwin; Morstatter, Fred; Hu, Minda; Chen, Emily; Burghardt, Keith; Ferrara, Emilio; Lerman, Kristina",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08498v1.pdf,352

In the area surrounding Pavia during the critical stage of the outbreak (Mar-Apr 2020), 1,225 of the documented 4,200 deaths were related to coronavirus disease 2019 infection, with a mortality rate of 181/100,000 inhabitants and an increase in deaths of 138% compared with the same period during previous years. Our aim was to report the experience of the Department of Vascular Surgery of Pavia (Lombardy, Italy), including the lessons learned and future perspectives regarding the management of coronavirus disease 2019 patients who developed severe acute ischemia with impending lower limb loss or deep vein thrombosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective data collection of coronavirus disease 2019 patients with severe acute ischemia of the lower limbs or deep vein thrombosis, which we observed in our department during the period March 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020. Primary outcomes of the analysis were postoperative mortality for all patients and amputation rates only in those coronavirus disease 2019 patients suffering from acute lower limb ischemia. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of the disease among admitted coronavirus disease 2019 patients, and any possible correlation among inflammatory parameters, thrombolytic status, and the presence of acute ischemia or deep vein thrombosis. RESULTS: We observed 38 patients (28 male) with severe coronavirus disease 2019 infection (6 with lower limb arterial thrombosis and 32 with deep vein thrombosis). The median patient age was 64 years (range 30-94 y). In the arterial group, 3 had thrombosis on plaque and 3 on healthy arteries (""simple"" arterial thrombosis). All underwent operative or hybrid (open/endo) revascularization; 1 patient died from major organ failure and 1 patient underwent major amputation. In the deep vein thrombosis group, 9 (28%) patients died from major organ failure, despite aggressive medical therapy. In patients with simple arterial thrombosis and those with deep vein thrombosis, we observed a decrease in inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein) and in D-dimer and fibrinogen after aggressive therapy (P <.001). CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that critically ill, coronavirus disease 2019 patients who develop arterial and deep vein thrombosis have a high risk of mortality, but, if treated properly, there is an improvement in overall survival, especially in patients of 60 years of age or younger.","Bozzani, Antonio; Arici, Vittorio; Tavazzi, Guido; Franciscone, Mila Maria; Danesino, Vittorio; Rota, Monica; Rossini, Rosa; Sterpetti, Antonio V; Ticozzelli, Giulia; Rumi, Elisa; Mojoli, Francesco; Bruno, Raffaele; Ragni, Franco",Surgery (St. Louis),,352

When regular operating returns, there will be a large volume of patients and an emphasis on a short hospital stay. Patients will be keen to return home, and capacity will need to maximised. Strategies to reduce the associated risks of surgery and to accelerate recovery will be needed, and so Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) should be promoted as the model of care. ERAS protocols are proven to reduce hospital stay safely; however, ERAS pathways may require adaption to ensure both patient and staff safety. The risk of exposure to possible sources of COVID-19 should be limited, and so hospital visits should be minimised. The use of technology such as smartphone apps to provide pre-operative education, wearable activity trackers to assist with rehabilitation, and the use of telemedicine to complete outpatient appointments may be utilised. Also, units should be reminded that ERAS protocols are multi-modal, and every component is vital to minimise the surgical stress response. The focus should be on providing better and not just faster care. Units should learn from the past in order to expedite the implementation of or adaption of existing ERAS protocols. Strong leadership will be required, along with a supportive organisational culture, an inter-professional approach, and a recognised QI method should be used to contextualize improvement efforts.","Wainwright, Thomas W",Medicina (Kaunas),,352

Here, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the impact of individual and municipal-level social inequalities on the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico City. METHODS: We analyzed suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, from the Mexico City Epidemiological Surveillance System from February 24th, 2020, to March 31 st, 2021. COVID-19 outcomes included rates of hospitalization, severe COVID-19, invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality. We evaluated socioeconomic occupation as an individual risk, and social lag, which captures municipal-level social vulnerability, and urban population density as proxies of structural risk factors. Impact of reductions in vehicular mobility on COVID-19 rates and the influence of risk factors were also assessed. Finally, we assessed discrepancies in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 excess mortality using death certificates from the General Civil Registry. RESULTS: We detected vulnerable groups who belonged to economically unfavored sectors and experienced increased risk of COVID-19 outcomes. Cases living in marginalized municipalities with high population density experienced greater for COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, policies to reduce vehicular mobility had differential impacts modified by social lag and urban population density. Finally, we report an under-registry of COVID-19 deaths along with an excess mortality closely related to marginalized and densely populated communities in an ambulatory setting. This could be attributable to a negative impact of modified hospital admission criteria during the pandemic.

Concerted leadership from administration provided a framework for this interaction to occur while faculty worked off-campus to address the many issues identified by the agricultural community, the industry sector, and other state agencies. During the onset period, much of our work was reactive; our efforts to address worker safety and health involved three primary areas within: 1) production agricultural workers, 2) produce growers and direct marketing enterprises, and 3) meat supply chain workers. Communication to target audiences relied upon our ability to convert face-to-face programming into virtual webinars, social media, and digital publications. A Food System Task Force mobilized specialists to address emerging issues, with one specific topic related to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). As we continue to face new seasons in agriculture production, and pockets of COVID-19 outbreaks within our state, we will continue to address the dynamic needs of our food supply systems. There are implications for how we will teach the agricultural workforce within a virtual platform, including the evaluation of the effectiveness of those training programs.

Most of the participants continue working during the pandemic period (83.8%), but they did not have SARS-COV-2 (96%), nor did their family members (80.7%). The wellbeing at work before SARS-COV-2 was 3.88 ± 0.71, statistically different (p < 0.05) from during the pandemic, with the wellbeing of 3.71 ± 0.78. Wellbeing at work was higher before the pandemic for all the analyzed variables. Analyzing variables separately before and during the pandemic, dietitians with partners, children and a Ph.D. presented higher scores for wellbeing at work. Professionals receiving more than five times the minimum wage have higher scores. During the pandemic, better wellbeing was observed for dietitians working remotely.","Matos, Raquel Adjafre da Costa; Akutsu, Rita de Cássia Coelho de Almeida; Zandonadi, Renata Puppin; Rocha, Ada; Botelho, Raquel Braz Assunção",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,352

A Narrative Review and Novel Approaches to Infection Containment,2020,"Understanding antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is indispensable for the development of containment measures to overcome the current COVID-19 pandemic Recent studies showed that serum from convalescent patients can display variable neutralization capacities Still, it remains unclear whether there are specific signatures that can be used to predict neutralization Here, we performed a detailed analysis of sera from a cohort of 101 recovered healthcare workers and we addressed their SARS-CoV-2 antibody response by ELISA against SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain and nucleoprotein Both ELISA methods detected sustained levels of serum IgG against both antigens Yet, the majority of individuals from our cohort generated antibodies with low neutralization capacity and only 6% showed high neutralizing titers against both authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus and the Spike pseudotyped virus Interestingly, higher neutralizing sera correlate with detection of -IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies against both antigens, while individuals with positive IgG alone showed poor neutralization response These results suggest that having a broader repertoire of antibodies may contribute to more potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization Altogether, our work provides a cross sectional snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response in recovered healthcare workers and provides preliminary evidence that possessing multiple antibody isotypes can play an important role in predicting SARS-CoV-2 neutralization","Noval, Maria G.; Kaczmarek, Maria E.; Koide, Akiko Rodriguez-Rodriguez Bruno A.; Louie, Ping Tada Takuya Hattori Takamitsu Panchenko Tatyana Romero Larizbeth A.; Teng, Kai Wen Bazley Andrew de Vries Maren Samanovic Marie I.; Weiser, Jeffrey N.; Aifantis, Ioannis Cangiarella Joan Mulligan Mark J.; Desvignes, Ludovic Dittmann Meike Landau Nathaniel R.; Aguero-Rosenfeld, Maria Koide Shohei Stapleford Kenneth A.",Scientific Reports (Nature Publisher Group),,352

Therefore, this study was designed to understand the changes in dietary and lifestyle behaviours that are major determinants of health during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online questionnaire using a convenience sample of 415 adults living in Kuwait (age range 18-73 years). RESULTS: The rate of skipping breakfast remained consistent, with a slight increase during the pandemic. Lunch remained the main reported meal before and during COVID-19. Compared to before COVID-19, people were much more likely have a late-night snack or meal during COVID-19 (OR = 3.57 (95% CI 1.79-7.26), p < 0.001). Moreover, there was a drastic decrease in the frequency of fast-food consumption during COVID-19, up to 82% reported not consuming fast food (p < 0.001). There was a significant increase in the percentage of participants who had their main meal freshly made (OR = 59.18 (95% CI 6.55-1400.76), p = 0.001). Regarding food group patterns, no significant differences were found before and during the pandemic in terms of the weekly frequency of consumption, except in the case of fish and seafood. There were no remarkable changes in beverage consumption habits among participants before and during the pandemic, except for Americano coffee and fresh juice. Furthermore, there was a great reduction in physical activity and an increase in the amount of screen time and sedentary behaviours. A notable increase was detected in day-time sleep and a decrease in night-time sleep among participants. CONCLUSION: In general, this study indicates some changes in daily life, including changes in some eating practices, physical activity and sleeping habits during the pandemic. It is important that the government considers the need for nutrition education programmes and campaigns, particularly during this critical period of the pandemic in Kuwait.","Husain, Wafaa; Ashkanani, Fatemah",Environ Health Prev Med,,352

Many rapidly implement eHealth and telemedicine solutions specific to SEM without guidance on how best to provide these services. AIM: The aim of this paper is to present some guiding principles on how to plan for and perform an SEM consultation remotely (teleSEM) based on a narrative review of the literature. A secondary aim is to develop a generic teleSEM injury template. RESULTS: eHealth and telemedicine are essential solutions to effective remote patient care, also in SEM. This paper provides guidance for wise planning and delivery of teleSEM. It is crucial for SEM physicians, technology providers and organisations to codesign teleSEM services, ideally involving athletes, coaches and other clinicians involved in the clinical care of athletes, and to gradually implement these services with appropriate support and education. CONCLUSION: teleSEM provides solutions for remote athlete clinical care during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

473436,Influencing Factors of Understanding COVID-19 Risks and Coping Behaviors among the Elderly Population,2020,"The COVID-19-pandemic in acute inpatient setting from nursing managers' and hygiene specialists' perspective - A qualitative study Abstract. Background: The COVID-19-pandemic is an unprecedented, exceptional situation and necessitates numerous adaptations of structures and processes in the acute inpatient setting. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore how acute inpatient care was influenced by the pandemic and which implications may result for the future from nursing managers' and hygiene specialists' point of view. METHODS: Qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews with five nursing managers and three hygiene specialists in four German acute care hospitals. Interviews were interpreted by using content analysis. RESULTS: Interviewees described how everyday routines in their hospitals were adapted to the prioritized care for COVID-19 patients. Main challenges were uncertainty and anxiety among staff, relative scarcity of equipment and workforce resources and rapid implementation of new requirements for treatment capacities. This was addressed by targeted communication and information, large efforts to ensure resources and coordinated control of all processes by cross-department, interprofessional task forces. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptations made to the structures and procedures of care delivery during the pandemic hold potential for future improvements of routine care, e. g. new workplace and skill mix models. To identify detailed practical implications, a renewed and deepened data analysis is needed at a later point of time, with a larger distance to the period of the pandemic.","Silies, Katharina; Schley, Angelika; Sill, Janna; Fleischer, Steffen; Müller, Martin; Balzer, Katrin",Pflege,,352

Unlike recent single cell RNA-sequencing analyses indicating uniformly low mRNA expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry-related host molecules in all nasal epithelial cells, we show that the protein levels are relatively high and their localizations are restricted to the apical side of multiciliated epithelial cells. In addition, we provide evidence in COVID-19 patients that SARS-CoV-2 is massively detected and replicated within the multiciliated cells. We observed these findings during the early stage of COVID-19, when infected ciliated cells are rapidly replaced by differentiating precursor cells. Moreover, our analyses reveal that SARS-CoV-2 cellular tropism is restricted to the nasal ciliated versus oral squamous epithelium. These results imply that targeting ciliated cells of the nasal epithelium during the early stage of COVID-19 could be an ideal strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 propagation.","Ahn, Ji Hoon; Kim, JungMo; Hong, Seon Pyo; Choi, Sung Yong; Yang, Myung Jin; Ju, Young Seok; Kim, Young Tae; Kim, Ho Min; Rahman, M D Tazikur; Chung, Man Ki; Hong, Sang Duk; Bae, Hosung; Lee, Chang-Seop; Koh, Gou Young",J. clin. invest,,352
476681,Accentuating the Interrelation between Consumer Intention and Healthy Packaged Food Selection during COVID-19: A Case Study of Pakistan,2021,"Purpose Metastases from cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) occur in 2-5% of cases. Surgery is the standard treatment, often combined with adjuvant radiotherapy. Concurrent carboplatin treatment with post-operative radiotherapy may be prescribed, although it has not shown benefit in recent clinical trials in high-risk cSCC patients. The novel high-Z nanoparticle thulium (III) oxide has been shown to enhance radiation dose delivery to brain tumors by specific uptake of these nanoparticles into the cancerous tissue. As the dose-enhancement capacity of thulium oxide nanoparticles following radiotherapy against metastatic cSCC cells is unknown, its efficacy as a radiosensitizer was evaluated, with and without carboplatin. Methodology Novel and validated human patient-derived cell lines of metastatic cSCC were used. The sensitivity of the cells to radiation was investigated using short term proliferation assays as well as clonogenic survival as the radiobiological endpoint. Briefly, cells were irradiated with 125 kVp orthovoltage X-rays (0 - 6 Gy) with and without thulium oxide nanoparticles (99.9 % trace metals basis; 50 µg/ml) or low dose carboplatin pre-sensitization. Results Cellular uptake of the nanoparticles was first confirmed by microscopy and found to have no impact on short-term cell survival for the cSCC cells, highlighting the biocompatibility of thulium oxide nanoparticles. Clonogenic cell survival assays confirmed radio-sensitization when exposed to thulium nanoparticles, with the cell sensitivity increasing by a factor of 1.24 (calculated at the 10% survival fraction) for the irradiated cSCC cells. The combination of carboplatin with thulium oxide nanoparticles with irradiation did not result in significant further reductions in survival compared to nanoparticles alone. Conclusions This is the first study to provide in vitro data demonstrating the independent radiosensitization effect of high-Z nanoparticles against metastatic cSCC with or without carboplatin. Further preclinical investigations with radiotherapy plus high-Z nanoparticles for the management of metastatic cSCC are warranted.","Perry, Jay Ryan; Minaei, Elahe; Engels, Elette; Ashford, Bruce; McAlary, Luke; Clark, Jonathan; Gupta, Ruta; Tehei, Moeava; Corde, Stéphanie; Carolan, Martin; Ranson, Marie",Phys. med. biol,,352
477087,Preparedness and Preventive Behaviors for a Pandemic Disaster Caused by COVID-19 in Serbia,2020,"Viruses remain one of the leading causes of animal and human disease. Some animal viral infections spread sporadically to human populations, posing a serious health risk. Particularly the emerging viral zoonotic diseases such as the novel, zoonotic coronavirus represent an actual challenge for the scientific and medical community. Besides human health risks, some animal viral infections, although still not zoonotic, represent important economic loses to the livestock industry. Viral infections pose a genuine concern for which there has been an increasing interest for new antiviral molecules. Among these novel compounds, antiviral peptides have been proposed as promising therapeutic options, not only for the growing body of evidence showing hopeful results but also due to the many adverse effects of chemical-based drugs. Here we review the current progress, key targets and considerations for the development of antiviral peptides (AVPs). The review summarizes the state of the art of the AVPs tested in zoonotic (coronaviruses, Rift Valley fever viruses, Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus, Dengue and Junín virus) and also non-zoonotic farm animal viruses (avian and cattle viruses). Their molecular target, amino acid sequence and mechanism of action are summarized and reviewed. Antiviral peptides are currently on the cutting edge since they have been reported to display anti-coronavirus activity. Particularly, the review will discuss the specific mode of action of AVPs that specifically inhibit the fusion of viral and host-cell membranes for SARS-CoV-2, showing in detail some important features of the fusion inhibiting peptides that target the spike protein of these risky viruses.","Hollmann, Axel; Cardoso, Nancy P; Espeche, Juan C; Maffía, Paulo C",Peptides,,352
477337,Potential Application of Whole Body Vibration Exercise For Improving The Clinical Conditions of COVID-19 Infected Individuals: A Narrative Review From the World Association of Vibration Exercise Experts (WAVex) Panel,2020,"New York City (NYC) was an epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the United States during spring 2020 (1). During March-May 2020, approximately 203,000 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported to the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). To obtain more complete data, DOHMH used supplementary information sources and relied on direct data importation and matching of patient identifiers for data on hospitalization status, the occurrence of death, race/ethnicity, and presence of underlying medical conditions. The highest rates of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were concentrated in communities of color, high-poverty areas, and among persons aged &#8805;75 years or with underlying conditions. The crude fatality rate was 9.2% overall and 32.1% among hospitalized patients. Using these data to prevent additional infections among NYC residents during subsequent waves of the pandemic, particularly among those at highest risk for hospitalization and death, is critical. Mitigating COVID-19 transmission among vulnerable groups at high risk for hospitalization and death is an urgent priority. Similar to NYC, other jurisdictions might find the use of supplementary information sources valuable in their efforts to prevent COVID-19 infections.","Thompson, Corinne N; Baumgartner, Jennifer; Pichardo, Carolina; Toro, Brian; Li, Lan; Arciuolo, Robert; Chan, Pui Ying; Chen, Judy; Culp, Gretchen; Davidson, Alexander; Devinney, Katelynn; Dorsinville, Alan; Eddy, Meredith; English, Michele; Fireteanu, Ana Maria; Graf, Laura; Geevarughese, Anita; Greene, Sharon K; Guerra, Kevin; Huynh, Mary; Hwang, Christina; Iqbal, Maryam; Jessup, Jillian; Knorr, Jillian; Latash, Julia; Lee, Ellen; Lee, Kristen; Li, Wenhui; Mathes, Robert; McGibbon, Emily; McIntosh, Natasha; Montesano, Matthew; Moore, Miranda S; Murray, Kenya; Ngai, Stephanie; Paladini, Marc; Paneth-Pollak, Rachel; Parton, Hilary; Peterson, Eric; Pouchet, Renee; Ramachandran, Jyotsna; Reilly, Kathleen; Sanderson Slutsker, Jennifer; Van Wye, Gretchen; Wahnich, Amanda; Winters, Ann; Layton, Marcelle; Jones, Lucretia; Reddy, Vasudha; Fine, Anne",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,352

477617,Telework and Social Services in Spain during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 infection is an aggressive viral illness with high risk of transmission during otolaryngology examination and surgery. Cholesteatoma is known for its potential to cause complications and scheduling of surgery during the pandemic must be done carefully. The majority of otological surgeries may be classified as elective and postponed at this time (e.g., stapedotomy, tympanoplasty); whereas, others are emergencies (e.g., complicated acute otitis media, complicated cholesteatoma with cerebral or Bezold's abscess, meningitis, sinus thrombosis) and require immediate intervention. What is the ideal time for the surgical management of Cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic? METHODS: Senior otologic surgeons from six teaching hospitals from various countries affected by the COVID-19 from around the world met remotely to make recommendations on reorganizing schedules for the treatment of cholesteatoma which has a risk of severe morbidity and mortality. The recommendations are based on their experiences and on available literature. RESULTS: Due to the high risk of infecting the surgical staff it is prudent to stop all elective ear surgeries and plan cholesteatoma surgery after careful selection of patients, based on the extent of the disease and available resources. Specific precautions including use of appropriate personal protection equipment should be followed when operating on all patients during the pandemic. To facilitate the decision-making in the management of cholesteatoma, timing for surgery can be divided into two categories with 3 and 2 sub-groups based on disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on the timing of surgery of patients with cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking. This manuscript contains practical tips on how cholesteatoma surgery can be reorganized during this pandemic.","George, Mercy; Alexander, Arun; Mathew, John; Iyer, Arunachalam; Waterval, Jerome; Simon, Christian; Marchioni, Daniele; Maire, Raphael",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,352

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic performance of the GeneFinderTMCOVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit on the ELITe InGenius sample-to-result platform, which is a commercial nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) targeting genes of SARS-CoV-2. STUDY DESIGN: Patients were eligible between March 18 and May 27, 2020, when they had respiratory symptoms that were suspected for COVID-19. The InGenius platform was compared to routine in-house NAT that was validated according to the national reference. RESULTS: Of 128 randomly selected patients, 58 (45 %) tested positive and 55 (43 %) tested negative in both platforms. Sensitivity of the InGenius platform was 100 % (95 % confidence interval 94-100). In the remaining 15 (12 %) cases E and RdRp genes were not detected in both platforms but the nucleoprotein (N) gene was tested positive by the InGenius platform. All solitary N gene positive cases were confirmed by a N-gene specific in-house validated NAT, and most of these patients could also be considered positive based on other recently available COVID-19 positive respiratory samples or highly suspected radiological findings. CONCLUSION: The InGenius platform for SARS-CoV-2 detection has excellent sensitivity, is easy to use and provides fast results. The inclusion of the N gene as a third gene target may further increase sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in comparison to the national reference method.","Ong, David S Y; Claas, Eric C J; Breijer, Simone; Vaessen, Norbert",J Clin Virol,,352

However, there is a scarcity of comparative studies on how modalities of conferencing programs impact health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare laptop-based with smartphone-based videoconferencing programs on nursing home residents' perceptions of loneliness, depressive symptoms and social support. METHODS: This retrospective secondary analysis used data from two previous studies on the effectiveness of videoconferencing programs (laptop-based and smartphone-based) to improve outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and social support (type and source) among nursing home residents. Generalised estimating equations compared differences from baseline measures with measures at 1 and 3 months between the two groups with and without adjusting for the effects of confounding variables. RESULTS: With the exception of age, there were no differences in demographics between participants in the laptop and smartphone groups. Neither changes from baseline in mean scores for loneliness nor depressive symptoms differed between groups. However, changes in mean scores from baseline between groups were significantly greater in the smartphone-based group compared with the laptop-based group for three types of social support: informational and appraisal at 1 and 3 months; and emotional at 3 months. Changes from baseline in mean scores for social support from friends (at 1 and 3 months) and other sources (at 3 months) were also significantly greater for the smartphone group compared with the laptop group. DISCUSSION: The two modalities of videoconferencing did not differ in effects on depressive symptoms or loneliness. However, smartphones had a greater effect on the type and source of social support compared with laptops.

However, there is a scarcity of comparative studies on how modalities of conferencing programs impact health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare laptop-based with smartphone-based videoconferencing programs on nursing home residents' perceptions of loneliness, depressive symptoms and social support. METHODS: This retrospective secondary analysis used data from two previous studies on the effectiveness of videoconferencing programs (laptop-based and smartphone-based) to improve outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and social support (type and source) among nursing home residents. Generalised estimating equations compared differences from baseline measures with measures at 1 and 3 months between the two groups with and without adjusting for the effects of confounding variables. RESULTS: With the exception of age, there were no differences in demographics between participants in the laptop and smartphone groups. Neither changes from baseline in mean scores for loneliness nor depressive symptoms differed between groups. However, changes in mean scores from baseline between groups were significantly greater in the smartphone-based group compared with the laptop-based group for three types of social support: informational and appraisal at 1 and 3 months; and emotional at 3 months. Changes from baseline in mean scores for social support from friends (at 1 and 3 months) and other sources (at 3 months) were also significantly greater for the smartphone group compared with the laptop group.

All forms of future EU-UK relationship are worse for health than EU membership, but analysis of the negotiating texts shows some forms are better than others. The likely outcomes involve major negative effects for NHS staffing, funding for health and social care, and capital financing for the NHS; and for UK global leadership and influence. We expect minor negative effects for cross border healthcare (except in Northern Ireland); research collaboration; and data sharing, such as the Early Warning and Response System for health threats. Despite political narratives, the legal texts show that the UK seeks de facto continuity in selected key areas for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and equipment [including personal protective equipment (PPE)], especially clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, and batch-testing. The UK will be excluded from economies of scale of EU membership, e.g. joint procurement programmes as used recently for PPE. Above all, there is a major risk of reaching an agreement with significant adverse effects for health, without meaningful oversight by or input from the UK Parliament, or other health policy stakeholders.","Fahy, Nick; Hervey, Tamara; Dayan, Mark; Flear, Mark; Galsworthy, Mike; Greer, Scott; Jarman, Holly; McKee, Martin",Health Econ Policy Law,,352

Mitigating the risk of reopening will require widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing, which would be greatly facilitated by simple, rapid, and inexpensive testing methods. This study evaluates several protocols for RNA extraction and RT-qPCR that are simpler and less expensive than prevailing methods. First, isopropanol precipitation is shown to provide an effective means of RNA extraction from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples. Second, direct addition of NP swab samples to RT-qPCRs is evaluated without an RNA extraction step. A simple, inexpensive swab collection solution suitable for direct addition is validated using contrived swab samples. Third, an open-source master mix for RT-qPCR is described that permits detection of viral RNA in NP swab samples with a limit of detection of approximately 50 RNA copies per reaction. Quantification cycle (Cq) values for purified RNA from 30 known positive clinical samples showed a strong correlation (r2 = 0.98) between this homemade master mix and commercial TaqPath master mix. Lastly, end-point fluorescence imaging is found to provide an accurate diagnostic readout without requiring a qPCR thermocycler. Adoption of these simple, open-source methods has the potential to reduce the time and expense of COVID-19 testing.","Graham, Thomas G W; Dugast-Darzacq, Claire; Dailey, Gina M; Nguyenla, Xammy H; Van Dis, Erik; Esbin, Meagan N; Abidi, Abrar; Stanley, Sarah A; Darzacq, Xavier; Tjian, Robert",PLoS One,,352

Short-term effects, as occurring in urban surroundings, have shown to have a negative impact on the Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based routing process. Therefore, we add a timer-based compensation mechanism to the update process and introduce a hybrid Machine Learning (ML) approach to classify Radio Environment Prototypes (REPs) with a dedicated ML component and enable the protocol for autonomous context adaption. The performance of the novel protocol is evaluated in comprehensive network simulations considering different REPs and is compared to well-known established routing protocols for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). The results show, that CA-PARRoT is capable to compensate the challenges confronted with in different REPs and to improve its Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) up to 23% compared to PARRoT, and outperform established routing protocols by up to 50 %.","Schuler, Cedrik; Sliwa, Benjamin; Wietfeld, Christian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06190v1.pdf,352

Original labour and social security legislation and global information on social security systems for each country were obtained and analysed by a multilingual research team using a common coding framework. While strong models exist across low- middle- and high-income countries, critical gaps that jeopardise health and economic security remain. 27% of countries do not guarantee paid sick leave from the first day of illness, essential to encouraging workers to stay home when they are sick and prevent spread. 58% of countries do not have explicit provisions to ensure self-employed and gig economy workers have access to paid sick leave benefits.

Through this qualitative study, we aimed to identify patients' perspectives as they undergo this change. From October 2019 to July 2020, we conducted nine pre- and six post-switch to biosimilar interviews with BC, English speaking participants, who were 18 years or older, and were currently taking a biologic medication. Participants were interviewed pre- and post-switch to a biosimilar medication and interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim for qualitative analysis. Interviews were thematically analysed and major themes and sub-categories were elucidated. The themes derived from pre and post-switch interviews captured participants' anticipated or experienced barriers and enablers to the policy change. In general, the fears and apprehension of participants approaching the switch, including concerns surrounding the efficacy and safety of biosimilars, were addressed by their rheumatologist and social support circles. For the most part, participants were able to successfully manage their disease regardless of their baseline concerns about efficacy and safety. Experiences of changes in health delivery models were also observed secondary to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic amongst participants. This study is the first of its kind to characterize the patient perspective regarding the BC Biosimilars Initiative. The incorporation of the patient perspective, including adequate provider-patient communication and shared decision-making can help to inform future non-medical switching policy changes.","Chew, Caitlin; Aguiar, Magda; Bansback, Nick; Law, Michael R; Harrison, Mark",Rheumatol.Int,,352

The MNAzyme and GNP probes are designed to be robust to viral mutations. Conserved regions of the viral genomes are targeted, and two MNAzymes are created for each virus. The ability of the system to distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A using 79 patient samples is tested. When detecting SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, the clinical sensitivity is 90%, and the specificity is 100%. When detecting influenza A, the clinical sensitivity and specificity are 93% and 100%, respectively. The high clinical performance of the MNAzyme-GNP assay shows that it can be used to help clinicians choose effective treatments.","Kozlowski, Hannah N; Abdou Mohamed, Mohamed A; Kim, Jisung; Bell, Natalie G; Zagorovsky, Kyryl; Mubareka, Samira; Chan, Warren C W",Small Struct,,352

These factors include undetected cases, asymptomatic cases, and several non-pharmaceutical interventions. Because of the rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide, understanding the significance of these factors is crucial in determining whether COVID-19 will be eradicated or persist in the population. Hence, in this study, we establish a new mathematical model to predict the spread of COVID-19 considering mentioned factors. RESULTS: Infection detection and vaccination have the potential to eradicate COVID-19 from Jakarta. From the sensitivity analysis, we find that rapid testing is crucial in reducing the basic reproduction number when COVID-19 is endemic in the population rather than contact trace. Furthermore, our results indicate that a vaccination strategy has the potential to relax social distancing rules, while maintaining the basic reproduction number at the minimum possible, and also eradicate COVID-19 from the population with a higher vaccination rate. In conclusion, our model proposed a mathematical model that can be used by Jakarta's government to relax social distancing policy by relying on future COVID-19 vaccine potential.","Aldila, Dipo; Samiadji, Brenda M; Simorangkir, Gracia M; Khosnaw, Sarbaz H A; Shahzad, Muhammad",BMC Res Notes,,352

Prior phase I trials (non COVID-19) demonstrated improvement in pulmonary function in ARDS patients using fibrinolytic therapy. A follow-up trial using the widely available tissue-plasminogen activator (alteplase) is now needed to assess optimal dosing and safety in this critically ill patient population. Objective: To describe the design and rationale of a Phase IIa trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of alteplase treatment for moderate/severe COVID-19-induced ARDS. Patients/Methods: A rapidly adaptive, pragmatic, open label, randomized, controlled, phase IIa clinical trial will be conducted with three groups: intravenous(IV) alteplase 50mg, IV alteplase 100mg, and control (standard-of-care). Inclusion criteria are known/suspected COVID-19 infection with PaO2/FiO2 ratio<150mmHg for >4 hours despite maximal mechanical ventilation management. Alteplase will be delivered through an initial bolus of 50mg or 100mg followed by heparin infusion for systemic anticoagulation, with alteplase re-dosing if there is a >20% PaO2/FiO2 improvement not sustained by 24 hours. Results: The primary outcome is improvement in PaO2/FiO2 at 48 hours post-randomization. Other outcomes include: ventilator- and ICU-free-days, successful extubation (no reintubation &#8804;3 days after initial extubation), and mortality. Fifity eligible patients will be enrolled in a rapidly adaptive, modified stepped-wedge design with four looks at the data. Conclusion: Findings will provide timely information on the safety, efficacy and optimal dosing of tPA to treat moderate/severe COVID-19-induced ARDS, which can be rapidly adapted to a phase III trial.

Multiple COVID-19 outbreaks occurred in agricultural settings, including a large outbreak among employees of a fruit grower during May-August. Because of this outbreak, Okanogan County Public Health and the Washington State Department of Health initiated one-time, on-site screening testing (2) of all orchard and warehouse employees in August 2020 and assessed risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among 3,708 known orchard employees, a valid SARS-CoV-2 test result or information on COVID-19-like symptoms in the absence of a test was available for 3,013 (81%). Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during approximately 3 months among tested orchard employees was 6%. Cumulative incidence was 12% in employees residing in the community, compared with 4% in employees residing in farmworker housing (p<0.001); point prevalence during the single screening testing event was 1% in both groups. Among 1,247 known warehouse employees, a valid result was available for 726 (58%). Cumulative incidence over approximately 3 months among tested warehouse employees was 23%, with substantial variation across job roles. Positive test results were received by 28% of employees who worked packing and sorting fruit, 24% of those in other roles in the packing and sorting area, 10% of forklift operators, 7% of employees in other warehouse roles, and 6% of office employees. Point prevalence among all warehouse workers was 1% at the screening testing event. Collaboration among employers, community groups, and public health authorities can reveal risk factors and help decrease farmworkers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community and the workplace. Creation of a COVID-19 assessment and control plan by agricultural employers, with particular focus on indoor workers whose jobs limit physical distancing, could reduce workplace transmission.","Miller, James S; Holshue, Michelle; Dostal, Tia K H; Newman, Laura P; Lindquist, Scott",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,352
503706,A Non-Linear Biostatistical Graphical Modeling of Preventive Actions and Healthcare Factors in Controlling COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Determine major barriers to, and facilitators of, influenza vaccination of Aboriginal adults, in order to improve coverage from the current level of 30%. METHODS: i) A focus group with 13 Aboriginal Immunisation Healthcare Workers; and ii) a cross-sectional survey of Aboriginal people aged &#8805;18 years at the 2017 New South Wales Koori Knockout (29 September-2 October). RESULTS: The focus group nominated poor identification of Aboriginality in general practice. Of 273 survey respondents, a substantial minority (30%) were unaware of their eligibility for free influenza vaccination. More than half (52%) believed the vaccine could cause influenza, 40% reported there were better ways than vaccination for avoiding infection and 30% said they would not have the vaccine if it was offered to them. Regarding health service access, few reported experiencing difficulty (17%), feeling uncomfortable (15%) or being discriminated against (8%), but 53% reported not receiving a reminder from a health professional. CONCLUSIONS: Misconceptions about influenza disease and vaccine among Aboriginal people and inadequate identification of Aboriginality in general practice appear to be the greatest barriers to vaccination, rather than health service access in general. Implications for public health: More active communication to and targeting of Aboriginal adults is required; this is even more urgent following the arrival of COVID-19.","Menzies, Robert; Aqel, Jalil; Abdi, Ikram; Joseph, Telphia; Seale, Holly; Nathan, Sally",Aust N Z J Public Health,,352
503774,Space-Time Cluster's Detection and Geographical Weighted Regression Analysis of COVID-19 Mortality on Texas Counties,2021,"Determine age-specific infection fatality rates for COVID-19 to inform public health policies and communications that help protect vulnerable age groups. Studies of COVID-19 prevalence were collected by conducting an online search of published articles, preprints, and government reports that were publicly disseminated prior to 18 September 2020. The systematic review encompassed 113 studies, of which 27 studies (covering 34 geographical locations) satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Age-specific IFRs were computed using the prevalence data in conjunction with reported fatalities 4 weeks after the midpoint date of the study, reflecting typical lags in fatalities and reporting. Meta-regression procedures in Stata were used to analyze the infection fatality rate (IFR) by age. Our analysis finds a exponential relationship between age and IFR for COVID-19. The estimated age-specific IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85. Moreover, our results indicate that about 90% of the variation in population IFR across geographical locations reflects differences in the age composition of the population and the extent to which relatively vulnerable age groups were exposed to the virus. These results indicate that COVID-19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. Moreover, the overall IFR for COVID-19 should not be viewed as a fixed parameter but as intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections. Consequently, public health measures to mitigate infections in older adults could substantially decrease total deaths.","Levin, Andrew T; Hanage, William P; Owusu-Boaitey, Nana; Cochran, Kensington B; Walsh, Seamus P; Meyerowitz-Katz, Gideon",Eur. j. epidemiol,,352

Studying and characterising the different aetiological subtypes, clinical characteristics, and functional outcomes may be valuable in guiding patient selection for optimal management and treatment. METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively on consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who developed acute focal brain ischaemia (between 1 March and 19 April 2020) at a tertiary university hospital in Madrid (Spain). RESULTS: During the study period, 1594 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. We found 22 patients with ischaemic stroke (1.38%), 6 of whom did not meet the inclusion criteria. The remaining 16 patients were included in the study (15 cases of ischaemic stroke and one case of transient ischaemic attack). Median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 9 (interquartile range: 16), and mean (standard deviation) age was 73 years (12.8). Twelve patients (75%) were men. Mean time from COVID-19 symptom onset to stroke onset was 13 days. Large vessel occlusion was identified in 12 patients (75%). We detected elevated levels of D-dimer in 87.5% of patients and C-reactive protein in 81.2%. The main aetiology was atherothrombotic stroke (9 patients, 56.3%), with the predominant subtype being endoluminal thrombus (5 patients, 31.2%), involving the internal carotid artery in 4 cases and the aortic arch in one. The mortality rate in our series was 44% (7 of 16 patients). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19, the most frequent stroke aetiology was atherothrombosis, with a high proportion of endoluminal thrombus (31.2% of patients). Our clinical and laboratory data support COVID-19-associated coagulopathy as a relevant pathophysiological mechanism for ischaemic stroke in these patients.","Gómez-Porro, P; Cabal-Paz, B; Valenzuela-Chamorro, S; Desanvicente, Z; Sabin-Muñoz, J; Ochoa-López, C; Flórez, C; Enríquez-Calzada, S; Martín-García, R; Esain-González, Í; García-Fleitas, B; Silva-Hernández, L; Ruiz-Molina, Á; Gamo-González, E; Durán-Lozano, A; Velasco-Calvo, R; Alba-Alcántara, L; González-Santiago, R; Callejas-Díaz, A; Brea-Álvarez, B; Salazar-Uribe, J C; Escamilla-Crespo, C; Carneado-Ruiz, J","Neurologia (Barc., Ed. impr.)",,352

Among these, hydrogen peroxide, initially tested by two of us for tolerability, showed both good performance and acceptable side effects (burning sensation for 15-20 s). We contacted circles of family physicians and the ATS Milano (Territorial Assistance and Prevention Service), and we tested this procedure on eight persistent carriers of SARS-CoV-2, performing swabs before the procedure and after it until the reappearance of the virus or until 14 days (the incubation period), keeping the surfaces clean with a hypertonic solution. Our patients had a median time from exposure or symptom onset of 111 days, and three had relapsed after being declared ""cured"" (two consecutive negative swabs after quarantine). One patient had a baseline negative swab and was excluded, and two successfully ended the 14 days' course, four suppressed viral elimination for 72 h, and one for 48 h, all rebounding to weak positive (cycle thresholds above 24).

We report the in-hospital characteristics of patients with acute myocardial infarction and concomitant COVID-19. METHODS: This was a registry-based retrospective analysis of patients admitted with positive COVID-19 tests who suffered acute myocardial infarction either before or during hospitalization; from 1 March 2020 to 1 April 2020 in a tertiary cardiovascular center-Tehran Heart Center. We performed an exploratory analysis to compare the clinical characteristics of patients who died during hospitalization or were discharged alive. RESULTS: In March 2020, 57 patients who had acute myocardial infarction and a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in the study. During hospitalization, 13 patients (22.8%) died after a mean hospital stay of 8.4 days. The deceased were older than the survivors. No significant association between mortality and sex or length of hospital stay was observed. Hypertensive individuals were more likely to have a fatal outcome. Previously receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers did not show any association with mortality. Regarding the laboratory data during hospitalization, higher cardiac troponin T, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, urea, and blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio were observed in the mortality group. The deceased had a lower lymphocyte count than the survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Markers of worsening renal function and immune system disturbance seem to be associated with mortality in concurrent acute myocardial infarction and COVID-19. Optimizing the management of acute coronary syndrome complicating COVID-19 requires addressing such potential contributors to mortality.","Tavolinejad, Hamed; Hosseini, Kaveh; Sadeghian, Saeed; Pourhosseini, Hamidreza; Lotfi-Tokaldany, Masoumeh; Masoudkabir, Farzad; Sattartabar, Babak; Masoudi, Maryam; Shafiee, Akbar; Badalabadi, Reza Mohseni; Pashang, Mina; Aein, Afsaneh; Tajdini, Masih",Turk Kardiyol Dern Ars,,352
518857,TV News and COVID-19: Media Influence on Healthy Behavior in Public Spaces,2021,"BACKGROUND: Dermatology is under-represented in UK undergraduate curricula, and with a diagnostic and educational toolkit that is heavily centred on face-to-face (F2F) clinical examination, dermatology education has been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Online channel-based messaging apps such as Slack offer an opportunity to engage students in remote, multimodal collaborative learning by reproducing a classroom environment in the virtual space. AIM: To determine the feasibility, acceptability and proof of concept for an online Slack community in undergraduate dermatology education. METHODS: Undergraduate medical students participated in an online classroom for a 6-week programme encompassing case-based discussions, seminars and journal clubs. The platform was facilitated by junior doctors (n = 10) and patient educators (n = 6). Students and faculty completed a post-course evaluation. Students additionally completed a pre- and post-intervention dermatology quiz. Mixed methods analyses included quantitative analyses to explore data trends and qualitative phenomenographic analyses to assimilate key underlying themes. RESULTS: Students (n = 65) were enrolled to join the platform. The evaluation was completed by students (n = 52) from UK universities (n = 27). The majority of students (n = 27) interacted with the platform as passive observers (&#8804; 5 active interactions with the channel), with a small group (n = 4) of 'super-users' (&#8805; 100 active interactions). The overall quality of the course was described as 'excellent' by 96% of participants and 100% of faculty. CONCLUSION: A community-based online classroom can act as an enjoyable, acceptable and collaborative means of delivering dermatology education to undergraduate medical students. Its ease of use and supportive nature may also facilitate patient involvement. Such advances may provide vital safeguards against the reduction in F2F learning that has accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic.","Phillips, A L; Edwards, S; Parmesar, K; Soltan, M; Guckian, J",Clin. exp. dermatol,,352
519214,What Are the Reasons for the Different COVID-19 Situations in Different Cities of China? A Study from the Perspective of Population Migration,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Although there are regional reports that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a reduction in acute myocardial infarction presentations and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures, little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mechanical complications resulting from ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and mortality. METHODS: This single-centre retrospective cohort study analysed presentations, incidence of mechanical complications, and mortality in patients with STEMI before and after a state of emergency was declared due to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Japanese government on 7 April 2020. RESULTS: We analysed 359 patients with STEMI hospitalised before the declaration and 63 patients hospitalised after the declaration. The proportion of patients with late presentation was significantly higher after the declaration than before (25.4% vs 14.2%, p=0.03). The incidence of late presentation was significantly higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than before (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 2.41; 95% CI, 1.37 to 4.05; p=0.001, even after adjusting for month (IRR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.33 to 5.13; p<0.01). Primary PCI was performed significantly less often after the declaration than before (68.3% vs 82.5%, p=0.009). The mechanical complication resulting from STEMI occurred in 13 of 359 (3.6%) patients before the declaration and 9 of 63 (14.3%) patients after the declaration (p<0.001). However, the incidence of in-hospital death (before, 6.2% vs after, 6.4%, p=0.95) was comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Following the COVID-19 pandemic, an increased incidence of mechanical complications resulting from STEMI was observed. Instructing people to stay at home, without effectively educating them to immediately seek medical attention when suffering symptoms of a heart attack, may worsen outcomes in patients with STEMI.","Kitahara, Satoshi; Fujino, Masashi; Honda, Satoshi; Asaumi, Yasuhide; Kataoka, Yu; Otsuka, Fumiyuki; Nakanishi, Michio; Tahara, Yoshio; Ogata, Soshiro; Onozuka, Daisuke; Nishimura, Kunihiro; Fujita, Tomoyuki; Tsujita, Kenichi; Ogawa, Hisao; Noguchi, Teruo",,,352

Six of 15 sets of primers were firstly identified to have faster amplification when tested with four RNA standards, and were further subjected to parallel comparison with the remaining four primer sets using 29 clinical samples. Among these 10 primer sets, Set-4 had the highest positive detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 (82.8%), followed by Set-10, Set-11, and Set-13 and Set-17 (75.9%). Set-14 showed the fastest amplification speed (Tt value < 8.5 min), followed by Set-17 (Tt value < 12.5 min). Based on the overall detection performance, Set-4, Set-10, Set-11, Set-13, Set-14 and Set-17 that target Nsp3, S, S, E, N and N gene regions of SARS-CoV-2, respectively, were determined to be better than the other primer sets. Two RT-LAMP assays with the Set-4 primers in combination with any one of four other primer sets (Set-14, Set-10, Set-11, and Set-13) were recommended to be used in the COVID-19 surveillance.","Dong, Yajuan; Wu, Xiuming; Li, Shenwei; Lu, Renfei; Li, Yingxue; Wan, Zhenzhou; Qin, Jianru; Yu, Guoying; Jin, Xia; Zhang, Chiyu",Sci Rep,,352

Experimental analyses were carried out to identify the electronic configuration by X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, which revealed monoclinic patterns of the C12/m1 space group with Wulff construction forming beta silver vanadate (ß-AgVO3) crystals with optical density and phase transformations. Ag nucleation showed consistent results with metallic formation and electronic changes occurring in [AgO5] and [AgO3] clusters. Transmission electron microscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscopy with elemental mapping and EDX analysis of the morphology reveals the nanorod structure for ß-AgVO3 with AgNPs on the surface and sheets for N-rGO.

Methods: Our model examines the size of the effect of spacing of the second dose with 6, 12, and 24 week deferred spacing regimens relative to 3 week spacing. Results: Deferring the second dose from 3 weeks to 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks shows progressive benefit to population immunity for any given time period, even with significant one dose efficacy decay. The benefits are influenced by vaccine supply per capita. Conclusion: The longer the second dose is deferred the larger the benefit in initial population immunity, provided one dose efficacy does not significantly wane. Monitoring one dose efficacy duration from the UK or Quebec minimizes this risk, as the gathered data will help ensure the second dose is given at an optimal time. How this information is implemented should vary depending on the population and whether the goal is to optimally protect high risk groups or to increase total population immunity as quickly as possible. Benefits to deferring the second dose are influenced by the length of deferral, one dose efficacy, and vaccine supply per capita. The time to herd immunity could be shortened by 4 weeks with the implementation of a 12 week spacing regimen or 10 weeks with a 24 week spacing regimen.","Jurgens, G.; Lackner, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252638v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.28.21252638,352

In previous research, we designed a summarization network called “partial-area taxonomy” to support comprehension of ontologies. The partial-area taxonomy for CIDO is of smaller magnitude than CIDO, but is still too large for comprehension. We present here the “weighted aggregate taxonomy” of CIDO, designed to provide compact views at various granularities of our partial-area taxonomy (and the CIDO ontology). Such a compact view provides a “big picture” of the content of an ontology. In previous work, in the visualization patterns used for partial-area taxonomies, the nodes were arranged in levels according to the numbers of relationships of their concepts. Applying this visualization pattern to CIDO's weighted aggregate taxonomy resulted in an overly long and narrow layout that does not support orientation and comprehension since the names of nodes are barely readable. Thus, we introduce in this paper an innovative visualization of the weighted aggregate taxonomy for better orientation and comprehension of CIDO (and other ontologies). A measure for the efficiency of a layout is introduced and is used to demonstrate the advantage of the new layout over the previous one. With this new visualization, the user can “see the forest for the trees” of the ontology. Benefits of this visualization in highlighting insights into CIDO’s content are provided. Generality of the new layout is demonstrated.","Zheng, Ling; Perl, Yehoshua; He, Yongqun; Ochs, Christopher; Geller, James; Liu, Hao; Keloth, Vipina K.",J Biomed Inform,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34224898/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046421001908?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046421001908,352

METHODS: Our data stem from an adult cohort created to prospectively investigate the relationship between diet and morbidity and mortality from chronic non-communicable diseases in Brazil. For this study, we selected the first participants (n = 10,116) who answered twice to a simplified questionnaire on their diet the day before, the first time when entering the study, between January 26 and February 15, 2020, and the second between May 10 and 19, 2020. The questionnaire inquiries about the consumption of healthy (vegetables, fruits and legumes) and unhealthy (ultra-processed foods) eating markers. Comparisons of indicators based on the consumption of these markers before and during the pandemic are presented for the study population and according to gender, age group, macro-region of residence and schooling. Chi-square tests and t-tests were used to compare proportions and means, respectively, adopting p < 0.05 to identify significant differences. RESULTS: For all participants, we found a modest but statistically significant increase in the consumption of healthy eating markers and stability in the consumption of unhealthy food markers. This favorable pattern of dietary changes during the pandemic occurred in most sociodemographic strata. We observed a less favorable changing pattern, with a tendency to increasing consumption of healthy and unhealthy food markers, in the Northeast and North macro-regions and among people with less schooling, suggesting social inequalities in the response to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: If confirmed, the trend of increased consumption of ultra-processed foods in underdeveloped regions and by people with less schooling is concerning, as eating these foods increases the risk of obesity, hypertension and diabetes, whose presence increases the severity and lethality of covid-19.","Steele, Eurídice Martínez; Rauber, Fernanda; Costa, Caroline dos Santos; Leite, Maria Alvim; Gabe, Kamila Tiemann; Louzada, Maria Laura da Costa; Levy, Renata Bertazzi; Monteiro, Carlos Augusto",Revista de saude publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901755/; https://doi.org/10.11606/s1518-8787.2020054002950,352

Description Nous avons mis en place un registre français sous l’égide de la Société francophone de transplantation pour recenser tous les cas de patients transplantés développant une infection à SARS-CoV-2 à partir du 1er mars 2020. Méthodes L’infection a été diagnostiquée chez des patients avec un frottis positif en RT-PCR ou en présence de lésions pulmonaires typiques. Les caractéristiques cliniques et biologiques, la gestion de l’immunosuppression, le traitement du COVID-19 et l’évolution de la maladie ont été colligés. La sévérité était définie par : admission ou transfert en réanimation, ventilation mécanique ou décès. Résultats Sur les 279 patients transplantés rénaux recensés dans le Registre, 243 ont été admis à l’hôpital et 36 ont été pris en charge à domicile. L’âge des patients hospitalisés était de 61,6 ans et la plupart présentaient des comorbidités (hypertension : 90 % ; surpoids : 64 % ; diabète : 41 % ; maladies cardiovasculaires : 36 %). La fièvre, la toux, la dyspnée et la diarrhée étaient les symptômes les plus fréquents. Les anti-métabolites étaient interrompus dans 70,8 des cas. Le traitement a comporté de l’hydroxychloroquine dans 25 % des cas, un antiviral pour 7,8 % des patients et du tocilizumab chez 5,3 %. Des formes sévères de COVID-19 sont survenues chez 106 patients (46 %). Quarante-trois patients sont décédés (taux de mortalité à 30jours : 22,8 %).

Methods: This study compares three population-based observational studies of patients with cancer carried out in three consecutive time periods characterized by different restrictive measures using a self-administered online questionnaire. Results: Among the basic needs, psychological and medical support appeared to be prevalent; so did the need for safe transportation to reach the treatment facilities. Internet was the main source of information on the coronavirus. Although 74.6% of the total number of patients did not give up hospital therapies, 34.8% complained about variations in the continuity of treatment, with different percentages in the three samples. The majority of the sample (73.8%) was worried of being infected, but 21.9% did not share their anxieties and worries with others. The multivariate regression analysis showed that a pessimistic perception of quality of life was influenced by living in extra-urban areas and alone (OR = 1.4; OR = 2.1); while a perception of a reduced physical function result affected by the state of anxiety and stress (OR = 1.9) and the difficulties in continuity of medical assistance (OR = 2.2). The scoring of the SF-12 in the Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary scores showed a fluctuating trend throughout the three periods investigated.

597479,The Safety of Slaughterhouse Workers during the Pandemic Crisis,2021-03-05,"Introduction. The developing world continues to face challenges in closing the large treatment gap for epilepsy, due to a high burden of disease and few experienced providers to manage the condition. Children with epilepsy are susceptible to higher rates of developmental impairments and refractory disease due to delays or absence of appropriate management as a result. We demonstrated that a structured education intervention on pediatric epilepsy can improve knowledge, confidence, and impact clinical practice of first level providers in Zambia. Methods. Three first-level facilities across Zambia were included. After initial pilot versions and revisions, the final course was implemented at each site. Pre- and post-intervention knowledge and confidence assessments were performed. Additionally, chart reviews were conducted prior to intervention and 4 months after completion of training at each site to assess change on management. Results. Twenty-three of the original 24 participants from all 3 sites completed the training; 48% clinical officers, 43% nurses, 9% other expertise. Of the 15 concepts tested by knowledge assessment, 12 showed trends in improvement, 7 of which were significant (P < .05). Chart reviews demonstrated significant improvement in documentation of seizure description (P = .008), seizure frequency (P = .00), and possible causes of seizures/epilepsy (P = .034). Discussion. Key elements of success to this program included hands on clinical skills building and case-based teaching, development of a program with direct and ongoing input from the target audience, and inclusion of assessments to monitor impact on clinical practice. Future studies looking at health outcomes are necessary to determine sustained impact.","Patel, Archana A.; Ciccone, Ornella; Nkole, Kafula Lisa; Kalyelye, Prisca; Sham, Lauren; Kielian, Agnieszka; Berger, Tamar; Huff, Hanalise V.; Johnson, Hannah F.; Sulu, Mercy; Mathews, Manoj; Mazumdar, Maitreyi",Glob Pediatr Health,https://doi.org/10.1177/2333794x20968718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33225022/,352

Independent oversight provided by DMCs is particularly important in trials conducted in public health emergencies, such as in HIV/AIDS or coronavirus epidemics. Special considerations are needed to enable DMCs to effectively address novel circumstances they face in such settings. In the COVID-19 pandemic, these include the remarkable speed in which data regarding benefits and risks of interventions are accumulated. DMCs must hold frequent virtual meetings, using state-of-the-art communication software that protects against risk for security breaches. Data capture and DMC reports should be focused on the most informative measures about benefits and risks. Since numerous clinical trials are being concurrently conducted in the COVID-19 setting, often addressing closely related scientific questions, structures for DMC oversight should be efficient and adequately informative. When these concurrently conducted trials are evaluating related regimens in related clinical settings, often individually underpowered for safety and having separate DMCs, processes should be implemented enabling these DMCs to share with each other emerging confidential evidence to better assess risks and benefits. Ideally a single DMC would monitor a portfolio of clinical trials or a trial with multiple arms, such as a platform trial.","DeMets, David L.; Fleming, Thomas R.",J Clin Epidemiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435620306120?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32659363/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895435620306120; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.07.001,352

Considerable controversy resulted regarding which procedures and behaviours were associated with the greatest risk of SARS-CoV transmission. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV during intubation from laboratory confirmed SARS patients to HCWs involved in their care. All SARS patients requiring intubation during the Toronto outbreak were identified. All HCWs who provided care to intubated SARS patients during treatment or transportation and who entered a patient room or had direct patient contact from 24 hours before to 4 hours after intubation were eligible for this study. Data was collected on patients by chart review and on HCWs by interviewer-administered questionnaire. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression models and classification and regression trees (CART) were used to identify risk factors for SARS transmission. RESULTS: 45 laboratory-confirmed intubated SARS patients were identified. Of the 697 HCWs involved in their care, 624 (90%) participated in the study. SARS-CoV was transmitted to 26 HCWs from 7 patients; 21 HCWs were infected by 3 patients. In multivariate GEE logistic regression models, presence in the room during fiberoptic intubation (OR = 2.79, p = .004) or ECG (OR = 3.52, p = .002), unprotected eye contact with secretions (OR = 7.34, p = .001), patient APACHE II score ≥20 (OR = 17.05, p = .009) and patient Pa0(2)/Fi0(2) ratio ≤59 (OR = 8.65, p = .001) were associated with increased risk of transmission of SARS-CoV. In CART analyses, the four covariates which explained the greatest amount of variation in SARS-CoV transmission were covariates representing individual patients. CONCLUSION: Close contact with the airway of severely ill patients and failure of infection control practices to prevent exposure to respiratory secretions were associated with transmission of SARS-CoV. Rates of transmission of SARS-CoV varied widely among patients.","Raboud, Janet; Shigayeva, Altynay; McGeer, Allison; Bontovics, Erika; Chapman, Martin; Gravel, Denise; Henry, Bonnie; Lapinsky, Stephen; Loeb, Mark; McDonald, L.

602470,Patterns of Psychological Responses among the Public during the Early Phase of COVID-19: A Cross-Regional Analysis,2021-04-14,"The novel coronavirus originated in December 2019 in Hubei, China. This contagious disease named as COVID-19 resulted in a massive expansion within 6 months by spreading to more than 213 countries. Despite the availability of antiviral drugs for the treatment of various viral infections, it was concluded by the WHO that there is no medicine to treat novel CoV, SARS-CoV-2. It has been confirmed that SARS-COV-2 is the most highly virulent human coronavirus and occupies the third position following SARS and MERS with the highest mortality rate. The genetic assembly of SARS-CoV-2 is segmented into structural and non-structural proteins, of which two-thirds of the viral genome encodes non-structural proteins and the remaining genome encodes structural proteins. The most predominant structural proteins that make up SARS-CoV-2 include spike surface glycoproteins (S), membrane proteins (M), envelope proteins (E), and nucleocapsid proteins (N). This review will focus on one of the four major structural proteins in the CoV assembly, the spike, which is involved in host cell recognition and the fusion process. The monomer disintegrates into S1 and S2 subunits with the S1 domain necessitating binding of the virus to its host cell receptor and the S2 domain mediating the viral fusion. On viral infection by the host, the S protein is further cleaved by the protease enzyme to two major subdomains S1/S2. Spike is proven to be an interesting target for developing vaccines and in particular, the RBD-single chain dimer has shown initial success. The availability of small molecules and peptidic inhibitors for host cell receptors is briefly discussed. The development of new molecules and therapeutic druggable targets for SARS-CoV-2 is of global importance. Attacking the virus employing multiple targets and strategies is the best way to inhibit the virus. This article will appeal to researchers in understanding the structural and biological aspects of the S protein in the field of drug design and discovery.","Kathiravan, Muthu Kumaradoss; Radhakrishnan, Srimathi; Namasivayam, Vigneshwaran; Palaniappan, Senthilkumar",Front Mol Biosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2021.637550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898518/,352

Aim and objectives: We present the demographic and clinical characteristics of lepromatous leprosy (LL) patients who had Covid-19 infection. Materials and methods: This study recruited patients hospitalized in Elazig Leprosy Hospital. Details of the patients were collected as follows: age, gender, presence of comorbidity, leprosy classification, clinical presentation, presence of leprosy reactions and complaints at the time of admission;laboratory and computed tomography (CT) findings and treatments applied. Results: This study included 9 patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL classification). Six patients were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, 7 patients had thoracic CT involvement. The mean age was 78.7 years (range 65-95). Complaints on admission included fatigue (n:7), cough (n:4) and fever (n:3) followed by sore throat (n:1), headache (n:1) and dysphonia (n:1). Two patients were asymptomatic, PCR positivity was detected in one and CT positivity was detected in another during screening. All patients received treatment with favipiravir and enoxaparin. No leprosy reactions occurred. All patients were discharged with recovery after completion of treatment. Conclusion: We expected that the risk for catching COVID-19 may be higher in LL patients who have a cellular immunity deficiency, and that the course of the infection may be more severe in COVID-19-infected LL patients, for the same reason. However, we have seen a decrease in the clinical severity of the COVID-19 and no patient losses. We conclude that this situation may be due to the drugs used for leprosy treatment.These immune-modulating drugs may cause a decrease in the clinical severity of the COVID-19, but we need larger studies on this subject.","Dertlioglu, S.

TCoV nsp15 consists of 338 residues and shares 40% sequence similarity to U-specific Nidovirales endoribonuclease (NendoU) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to characterize TCoV nsp15. METHODS: The TCoV nsp15 gene was cloned into pTriEX1 and expressed as a C-terminal His-tagged recombinant protein in BL21 (DE3). The recombinant nsp15 was purified by Ni-NTA resin. Synthetic RNA substrates were used to determine the substrate specificity of the TCoV nsp15. RNA zymography was used to determine the active form of the nsp15. RESULTS: The TCoV nsp15 did not cleave DNA but degraded total cellular RNA. The TCoV nsp15 cleaved single-stranded (ss) RNA at the uridylate site. The TCoV nsp15 cleaved hairpin RNA, pRNA, and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of infectious bursal disease virus very slowly, implying that dsRNA is not a good substrate for the TCoV nsp15. No divalent metal ion was required for in vitro enzymatic activity of the TCoV nsp15. The active form of the TCoV nsp15 was a homohexamer and disulfide bond was essential for the enzymatic activity. CONCLUSION: The TCoV nsp15 is a NendoU but has some characteristics different from other NendoU.","Cao, Jianzhong; Wu, Ching-Ching; Lin, Tsang Long",Intervirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19023218/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000175837,352

We hypothesized that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration could restore this redox homeostasis and suppress unfavorable evolution in Covid-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether NAC in high doses can avoid respiratory failure in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: It was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, unicentric trial, conducted at the Emergency Department of Hospital das Clínicas, São Paulo, Brazil. We enrolled 135 patients with severe Covid-19 (confirmed or suspected), with an oxyhemoglobin saturation of less than 94% or respiratory rate higher than 24 breaths/min. Patients were randomized to receive NAC 21 g (approximately 300 mg/kg) for 20 hours, or dextrose 5%. Primary endpoint was the need for mechanical ventilation. Secondary endpoints were time of mechanical ventilation, admission to ICU, time in ICU, and mortality. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were very similar in the two groups, with no significant difference in age, sex, comorbidities, medicines taken, and disease severity. Also, groups were similar in laboratory tests and chest CT scan findings. Sixteen patients (23.9%) in the Placebo group were submitted to endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, compared to 14 patients (20.6%) in the NAC group (p=0.675). No difference was observed in secondary endpoints. CONCLUSION: Administration of NAC in high doses did not affect the evolution of severe Covid-19.","de Alencar, Julio Cesar Garcia; Moreira, Claudia de Lucena; Müller, Alicia Dudy; Chaves, Cleuber Esteves; Fukuhara, Marina Akemi; da Silva, Elizabeth Aparecida; Miyamoto, Maria de Fátima Silva; Pinto, Vanusa Barbosa; Bueno, Cauê Gasparotto; Lazar, Felippe; Gomez, Luz Marina; Menezes, Maria Clara Saad; Marchini, Julio Flavio Meirelles; Marino, Lucas Oliveira; Brandão, Rodrigo Antônio; Souza, Heraldo Possolo",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32964918/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1443,352

Firsthand data were gathered through interviews, observations, and participation based on direct interaction with leaders and employees. The concept of leadership anatomy is used to describe, discuss, and critique leadership behavior. It signifies the different parts of a human body equipped with sensory ability. The study reveals that in times of crisis, leaders tend to draw on the core of who they are through compassion rather than conventional wisdom in decision making and problem solving. The search for what truly matters helps leaders to reinterpret the ethos of the firm and what they stand for as leaders in their sensemaking of chaos. A deeper reflection of their personal values and beliefs gives them the courage to acknowledge their vulnerability and start seeing the value in others.","Yeo, Roland K.",Organ Dyn,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orgdyn.2020.100800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071369/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0090261620300528; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090261620300528,352

607119,Review of the Lithuanian Alcohol Control Legislation in 1990–2020,2020-05-15,"Many viruses globally shut off host gene expression to inhibit activation of cell-intrinsic antiviral responses. However, host shutoff is not indiscriminate, since viral proteins and host proteins required for viral replication are still synthesized during shutoff. The molecular determinants of target selectivity in host shutoff remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that the influenza A virus shutoff factor PA-X usurps RNA splicing to selectively target host RNAs for destruction. PA-X preferentially degrades spliced mRNAs, both transcriptome-wide and in reporter assays. Moreover, proximity-labeling proteomics revealed that PA-X interacts with cellular proteins involved in RNA splicing. The interaction with splicing contributes to target discrimination and is unique among viral host shutoff nucleases. This novel mechanism sheds light on the specificity of viral control of host gene expression and may provide opportunities for development of new host-targeted antivirals.","Gaucherand, Lea; Porter, Brittany K.; Schmaling, Summer K.; Rycroft, Christopher Harley; Kevorkian, Yuzo; McCormick, Craig; Khaperskyy, Denys A.; Gaglia, Marta Maria",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/442996,352

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A nationwide cohort of confirmed COVID-19 (n=8,070) between January 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020, and a 1:15 age-, sex-, and residence-matched cohort (n=121,050) were constructed. A nested case-control study was performed to compare the proportion of patients with lung cancer between the COVID-19 cohort and the matched cohort. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with lung cancer was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort (0.5% [37/8,070]) than in the matched cohort (0.3% [325/121,050]) (p=0.002). The adjusted odds ratio [OR] of having lung cancer was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort than in the matched cohort (adjusted OR, 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 2.10). Among patients in the COVID-19 cohort, compared to patients without lung cancer, those with lung cancer were more likely to have severe COVID-19 (54.1% vs. 13.2%, p < 0.001), including mortality (18.9% vs. 2.8%, p < 0.001). The adjusted OR for the occurrence of severe COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer relative to those without lung cancer was 2.24 (95% CI, 1.08 to 4.74).

The underlying model incorporates the possible treatment measures as the emerging scenario of covid-19 vaccines. Keeping in view the fact that the real time data for covid-19 is updated at discrete time steps, we propose a new structure preserving numerical scheme for the proposed model. The proposed numerical scheme produces realistic solutions of the complex bi-modal SITR nonlinear model, converges unconditionally to steady states and reflects dynamical consistency with continuous sense of the model. The analysis of the model reveals that the model remains stable at the steady state points. The basic reproduction number R covid falls less than 1 when treatment rate is increased and disease will die out. On the other hand, it predicts that human population may face devastating effects of pandemic if the treatment measures are not strictly implemented.","Rafiq, Muhammad; Ali, Javaid; Bilal Riaz, Muhammad; Awrejcewicz, Jan",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110016821003495?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1110016821003495,352

In the present study, we investigate the epidemiologic and viral molecular features of HAdVs circulating in Senegal after 4 consecutive years of sentinel surveillance of influenza-like Illness cases. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: From January 2012 to December 2015 swabs were collected from consenting ILI outpatients. Adenoviral detection is performed by rRT-PCR with the Anyplex(™) II RV16 Detection kit (Seegene) and molecular characterization was performed using a partial hexon gene sequence. 6381 samples were collected. More than half of patients (51.7%; 3297/6381) were children of ≤ 5 years. 1967 (30.8%) were positive for HAdV with 1561 (79.4%) found in co-infection with at least one another respiratory virus. The most common co-detections were with influenza viruses (53.1%; 1045/1967), rhinoviruses (30%; 591/1967), enteroviruses (18.5%; 364/1967) and RSV (13.5%; 266/1967). Children under 5 were the most infected group (62.2%; 1224/1967; p <0.05). We noted that HAdV was detected throughout the year at a high level with detection peaks of different amplitudes without any clear seasonality. Phylogenetic analysis revealed species HAdV-C in majority, species HAdV-B and one HAdV- 4 genome type. The 9 HAdV-B species like strains from Senegal grouped with genome types HAdV-7, HAdV-55 and HAdV-11 as shown by a phylogenetic branch with a high bootstrap value of (88%). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest strong year-round HAdV activity in Senegal, especially in children up to 5 years of age. Molecular studies revealed that the dominant species in circulation in patients with ILI appears to be HAdV-C and HAdV-B species. The circulation of though HAdV-7 and HAdV-55 genome types is of note as these serotypes are recognized causes of more severe and even fatal acute respiratory infections.","Niang, Mbayame Ndiaye; Diop, Ndeye Sokhna; Fall, Amary; Kiori, Davy E.; Sarr, Fatoumata Diene; Sy, Sara; Goudiaby, Déborah; Barry, Mamadou Aliou; Fall, Malick; Dia, Ndongo",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28328944/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174287,352
609867,"The Relationship between Korean Adolescents’ Sports Participation, Internal Health Locus of Control, and Wellness during COVID-19",2021-03-13,"We compare two broad types of empirically grounded random network models in terms of their abilities to capture both network features and simulated Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic dynamics. The types of network models are exponential random graph models (ERGMs) and extensions of the configuration model. We use three kinds of empirical contact networks, chosen to provide both variety and realistic patterns of human contact: a highly clustered network, a bipartite network and a snowball sampled network of a “hidden population”. In the case of the snowball sampled network we present a novel method for fitting an edge-triangle model. In our results, ERGMs consistently capture clustering as well or better than configuration-type models, but the latter models better capture the node degree distribution. Despite the additional computational requirements to fit ERGMs to empirical networks, the use of ERGMs provides only a slight improvement in the ability of the models to recreate epidemic features of the empirical network in simulated SIR epidemics. Generally, SIR epidemic results from using configuration-type models fall between those from a random network model (i.e., an Erdős-Rényi model) and an ERGM. The addition of subgraphs of size four to edge-triangle type models does improve agreement with the empirical network for smaller densities in clustered networks. Additional subgraphs do not make a noticeable difference in our example, although we would expect the ability to model cliques to be helpful for contact networks exhibiting household structure.","Rolls, David A.; Wang, Peng; McBryde, Emma; Pattison, Philippa; Robins, Garry",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26555701/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0142181,352

There are currently no specific treatments available for this lethal virus, although several drugs, including remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine, have been tested. The purpose of this study is to assess the activity of FDA-approved drugs cetilistat, abiraterone, diiodohydroxyquinoline, bexarotene, remdesivir, and hydroxychloroquine as potential SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors. Additionally, this study aims to provide insight into the development of potential inhibitors that may inhibit ACE2, thereby preventing SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell and infection. To this end, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine were used as comparator drugs. The calculations revealed that cetilistat, abiraterone, diiodohydroxyquinoline, and bexarotene inhibit main protease and ACE2 receptors more effectively than the well-known drug hydroxychloroquine when used against COVID-19. Meanwhile, bexarotene and cetilistat bind more tightly to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and the ACE2 receptor, respectively, than remdesivir, a potential treatment for COVID-19 that is the first FDA-approved drug against this virus. As a result, the molecular dynamic simulations of these two drugs in the presence of proteins were investigated. The MD simulation results demonstrated that these drugs interact to stabilize the systems, allowing them to be used as effective inhibitors of these proteins. Meanwhile, bexarotene, abiraterone, cetilistat, and diiodohydroxyquinoline's systemic effects should be further investigated in suitable ex vivo human organ culture or organoids, animal models, or clinical trials.","Shahabadi, Nahid; Zendehcheshm, Saba; Mahdavi, Mohammad; Khademi, Fatemeh",Inform Med Unlocked,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914821002215?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2021.100745; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352914821002215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34568544/,352
611740,Trends in Suicide Mortality in 10 Years around the Great East Japan Earthquake: Analysis of Evacuation and Non-Evacuation Areas in Fukushima Prefecture,2021-06-03,"BACKGROUND: The PolyPrime intervention is a theory-based intervention aimed at improving appropriate polypharmacy in older people (aged ≥65 years) in primary care. The intervention consists of an online video which demonstrates how general practitioners (GPs) can prescribe appropriate polypharmacy during a consultation with an older patient and a patient recall process, whereby patients are invited to scheduled medication review consultations with GPs. The aim of the process evaluation is to further examine the implementation of the PolyPrime intervention in primary care. This will involve investigating whether the PolyPrime intervention can be delivered as intended across two healthcare systems, how acceptable the intervention is to GPs, practice staff and patients, and to identify the intervention’s likely mechanisms of action. METHODS: The PolyPrime study is an external pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) which aims to recruit 12 GP practices across Northern Ireland [NI] (n=6) and the six counties in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) that border NI (n=6). Practices have been randomised to intervention or usual care. An embedded process evaluation will assess intervention fidelity (i.e. was the intervention delivered as intended), acceptability of the intervention to GPs, practice staff and patients and potential mechanisms of action (i.e. what components of the intervention were perceived to be effective). Quantitative data will be collected from data collection forms completed by GPs and practice staff and a feedback questionnaire completed by patients from intervention arm practices, which will be analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data will be collected through semi-structured interviews with GPs and practice staff and audio-recordings of medication review appointments from the intervention arm practices which will be transcribed and analysed using the framework method. Quantitative and qualitative data will be triangulated to provide an overall assessment of intervention fidelity, intervention acceptability, and mechanisms of action. DISCUSSION: This process evaluation will add to feasibility data from the pilot cRCT by providing evidence on the fidelity of implementing the intervention package across two healthcare systems, the acceptability of the intervention and potential mechanisms of action.

In the case of a novel disease with widespread consequences, society is more likely to place significant value on interventions that reduce the outsized economic burden of COVID-19. Treatments for severe disease will have a different value profile to that of large-scale vaccines because of their application in targeted and potentially small subsets of those with symptomatic disease vs broad deployment as a preventative measure. Where vaccines reduce transmissibility of COVID-19, use of therapeutics will target symptoms, up to and including death for infected individuals. This paper describes discussions from a virtual expert panel that met to attempt a consensus on how existing principles of economic evaluation should be applied to therapeutics that emerge in a pandemic setting, with specific focus on severe hospitalised cases of COVID-19. The panel concluded that the core principles of economic evaluation do not need to be drastically overhauled to meet the challenges of a pandemic, but that there are several additional elements of value such as equity, disease severity, insurance value, and scientific and family spillover effects that should be considered when presenting results to decision makers. The panel also highlighted the persistent challenges on how society should value novel therapies, such as the appropriate cost-effectiveness threshold to apply, which are particularly salient during a pandemic.","Asukai, Yumi; Briggs, Andrew; Garrison, Louis P.; Geisler, Benjamin P.; Neumann, Peter J.; Ollendorf, Daniel A.",Pharmacoeconomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34557996/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-021-01088-5,352

The study is an online questionnaire-based survey. We received responses from 137 SS patients. Regarding the general emotional status, 33 patients (24.0%) and 47 patients (34.3%) declared to have been sadder/depressive and more agitated/anxious during the SARS-CoV2 outbreak, respectively. During the lockdown, 49 (33.7%) patients strictly and 77 patients (56.2%) did their best to respect the home isolation measures. The income was unchanged for most of the patients (94 patients, 68.6%). Regarding access to healthcare providers, 27 patients (18.7%) postponed the consultation for fear of getting SARS-CoV2. In our study group, 31 patients (22.6%) responded that they have had COVID-19. Only one patient was completely asymptomatic, while the most frequently declared symptom was weakness (84.0%). In 17 patients among the respondents (68%) the symptoms lasted for at least 2 weeks; the most frequent long-lasting symptoms were fatigue (40.0%) and weakness (36.0%). Out of all the respondents, 53 patients (41.4%) were vaccinated against SARS-CoV2 with at least one dose. After the first dose, the most prevalent side effect was pain at the site of injection (89.2%), followed by weakness (25.0%) and myalgias (21.4%). This information will be useful for developing special programs dedicated to SARS-CoV2 infection and vaccination in patients with SS and other autoimmune diseases.

The tissue tropism of SARS-CoV includes not only the lung, but also the gastrointestinal tract, kidney and liver. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the C-type lectin CD209L (also known L-SIGN), and DC-SIGN bind SARS-CoV, but ACE2 appears to be the key functional receptor for the virus. There is a prominent innate immune response to SARS-CoV infection, including acute-phase proteins, chemokines, inflammatory cytokines and C-type lectins such as mannose-binding lectin, which plays a protective role against SARS. By contrast there may be a lack of type 1 interferon response. Moreover, lymphopenia with decreased numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells is common during the acute phase.

Human life expectancy has greatly increased in the past few decades, but this has not been accompanied by a similar increase in their healthspan. At present, research on aging biology has focused on elucidating the biochemical and genetic pathways that contribute to aging over time. Several aging mechanisms have been identified, primarily including genomic instability, telomere shortening, and cellular senescence. Aging is a driving factor of various age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, immune system disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders. Efforts to find drugs that improve the healthspan by targeting the pathogenesis of aging have now become a hot topic in this field. In the present review, the status of aging research and the development of potential drugs for aging-related diseases, such as metformin, rapamycin, resveratrol, senolytics, as well as caloric restriction, are summarized. The feasibility, side effects, and future potential of these treatments are also discussed, which will provide a basis to develop novel anti-aging therapeutics for improving the healthspan and preventing aging-related diseases.","Li, Zhe; Zhang, Zhenkun; Ren, Yikun; Wang, Yingying; Fang, Jiarui; Yue, Han; Ma, Shanshan; Guan, Fangxia",Biogerontology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10522-021-09910-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33502634/,352

Scalable, sensitive and specific serological assays are essential to this process. The detection of antibody in hospitalized patients with severe disease has proven relatively straightforward; detecting responses in subjects with mild disease and asymptomatic infections has proven less reliable. We hypothesized that the suboptimal sensitivity of antibody assays and the compartmentalization of the antibody response may contribute to this effect. We systematically developed an ELISA, optimizing different antigens and amplification steps, in serum and saliva from non‐hospitalized SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected subjects. Using trimeric spike glycoprotein, rather than nucleocapsid, enabled detection of responses in individuals with low antibody responses. IgG1 and IgG3 predominate to both antigens, but more anti‐spike IgG1 than IgG3 was detectable. All antigens were effective for detecting responses in hospitalized patients. Anti‐spike IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses were readily detectable in saliva from a minority of RT‐PCR confirmed, non‐hospitalized symptomatic individuals, and these were mostly subjects who had the highest levels of anti‐spike serum antibodies. Therefore, detecting antibody responses in both saliva and serum can contribute to determining virus exposure and understanding immune responses after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.","Faustini, Sian E.; Jossi, Sian E.; Perez‐Toledo, Marisol; Shields, Adrian M.; Allen, Joel D.; Watanabe, Yasunori; Newby, Maddy L.; Cook, Alex; Willcox, Carrie R.; Salim, Mahboob; Goodall, Margaret; Heaney, Jennifer L.; Marcial‐Juarez, Edith; Morley, Gabriella L.; Torlinska, Barbara; Wraith, David C.; Veenith, Tonny V.; Harding, Stephen; Jolles, Stephen; Ponsford, Mark J.; Plant, Tim; Huissoon, Aarnoud; O'Shea, Matthew K.; Willcox, Benjamin E.; Drayson, Mark T.; Crispin, Max; Cunningham, Adam F.; Richter, Alex G.",Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.13349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932228/,352
622493,A New Multiplatform Model for Outpatient Prenatal and Postpartum Care in a Cohort of COVID-19-Affected Obstetric Patients,2021-05-12,"BACKGROUND: Whilst evidence of use of face masks in reducing COVID-19 cases is increasing, the impact of mandatory use across a large population has been difficult to assess. Introduction of mandatory mask use on July 22, 2020 during a resurgence of COVID-19 in Melbourne, Australia created a situation that facilitated an assessment of the impact of the policy on the epidemic growth rate as its introduction occurred in the absence of other changes to restrictions. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Exponential epidemic growth or decay rates in daily COVID-19 diagnoses were estimated using a non-weighted linear regression of the natural logarithm of the daily cases against time, using a linear spline model with one knot (lspline package in R v 3.6.3). The model’s two linear segments pivot around the hinge day, on which the mask policy began to take effect, 8 days following the introduction of the policy. We used two forms of data to assess change in mask usage: images of people wearing masks in public places obtained from a major media outlet and population-based survey data. Potential confounding factors (including daily COVID-19 tests, number of COVID-19 cases among population subsets affected differentially by the mask policy–e.g., healthcare workers) were examined for their impact on the results. Daily cases fitted an exponential growth in the first log-linear segment (k = +0.042, s.e. = 0.007), and fitted an exponential decay in the second (k = -0.023, s.e. = 0.017) log-linear segment. Over a range of reported serial intervals for SARS-CoV-2 infection, these growth rates correspond to a 22–33% reduction in an effective reproduction ratio before and after mandatory mask use. Analysis of images of people in public spaces showed mask usage rose from approximately 43% to 97%. Analysis of survey data found that on the third day before policy introduction, 44% of participants reported “often” or “always” wearing a mask; on the fourth day after, 100% reported “always” doing so. No potentially confounding factors were associated with the observed change in growth rates. CONCLUSIONS: The mandatory mask use policy substantially increased public use of masks and was associated with a significant decline in new COVID-19 cases after introduction of the policy. This study strongly supports the use of masks for controlling epidemics in the broader community.","Scott, Nick; Saul, Allan; Spelman, Tim; Stoove, Mark; Pedrana, Alisa; Saeri, Alexander; Grundy, Emily; Smith, Liam; Toole, Michael; McIntyre, Chandini Raina; Crabb, Brendan S.; Hellard, Margaret",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34288910/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253510,352

SUD is understood as a biopsychosocial disorder. People who want to stop using substances or wish to increase their wellbeing while using substances need to undergo a recovery process. We conducted qualitative interviews with 11 former patients four years after discharge from inpatient SUD treatment in the Tyrili Foundation to explore their experiences and reflections on SUD and the recovery process. The findings indicated that recovery processes are complex, and feelings of wellbeing and success vary over time. Several interrelated aspects of life were essential for seeking a better life: Understanding own substance use; Feeling safe; Understanding the impact of close relationships; and Perceptions of participation and belonging. The informants emphasised the need for access to professional and social support during the recovery process, which, for some, will last for many years. Receiving such support is not understood as a defeat, and each person’s resources and vulnerabilities should be recognized and acknowledged. SUD and recovery should be understood using the same coherent approach—as an interplay between biological and psychological factors and social, political and cultural contexts.","Wangensteen, Turid; Hystad, Jacob",J Psychosoc Rehabil Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34466372/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40737-021-00233-9,352

One of the reasons is the possibility of infection of the recipient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Determining the risk of transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a donor organ is very important for developing a kidney transplantation policy during a pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHOD: We present cases of kidney transplantation from COVID-19–positive deceased donors to 2 dialysis patients 49 and 45 years old. One of them was on hemodialysis for 28 months; the other received continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Both patients received only basic immunosuppression, including tacrolimus, methylprednisolone, and mycophenolic acid. No antilymphocyte agents were used for induction therapy. RESULTS: Cold ischemia time was 22 and 21 hours, respectively. One recipient had delayed graft function with increasing of urine output on day 8; another had immediate function. Both patients had no febrile and no other symptoms of acute respiratory disease during their hospital stay. No abnormalities on the chest x-ray were seen. No serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were detected before and during 6 weeks after surgery. Repeated nasopharyngeal swabs real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) were negative during the period. Both recipients were discharged 5 weeks after surgery with serum creatinine levels of 122 and 91 mcmol/L, respectively. CONCLUSION: Today we have no evidence of the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 from a SARS-CoV-2 positive donor to a kidney recipient. We also have no reason to suspect kidney damage by COVID-19 in a deceased donor at normal serum creatinine level.","Perlin, D.V.; Dymkov, I.N.; Terentiev, A.V.; Perlina, A.V.",Transplant Proc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041134521000294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33589232/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2021.01.025; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041134521000294,352

Due to the lack of broad diagnostic setup, consistent reagent supply lines, and access to laboratory instruments and equipment, it is undoubtedly an enormous burden for developing countries to face the crisis. OBJECTIVES: To develop a cost-effective, reliable and sensitive multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 screening which would expand the testing capacities of a developing and low-income country like Bangladesh. STUDY DESIGN: Initially a singleplex and then a multiplex real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR assays were developed targeting 2 nucleocapsid genes of SARS-CoV-2, and the human RNase P gene as an internal control using laboratory-made mastermixes. Three sets of primer- probes were designed for each of the target genes and one set was optimized for the final reaction set-up. Limit of detection, cross-reactivity and reproducibility were checked in order to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the assays, and validation was done using clinical specimens. RESULTS: Clinical evaluation of the new assays using 240 nasopharyngeal swabs showed 100 % sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in human. Equal efficiency and concordant results were observed between the singleplex and multiplex approaches. Notably, the kit was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA at very low concentration upto 5 copies/reaction. CONCLUSION: This is the first locally developed multiplex rRT-PCR kit in Bangladesh providing rapid and low-cost screening of COVID-19 which would be valuable for infection prevention and clinical management in the perspective of Bangladesh.","Noor, Farjana Akther; Safain, Kazi Sarjana; Hossain, Md.

628109,Facial Self-Touching and the Propagation of COVID-19: The Role of Gloves in the Dental Practice,2021-06-29,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most frequently reported symptoms with prevalence rates of 25 to 60 percent in (non-)Hodgkin lymphoma survivors. Several (pilot) studies showed promising effects of light therapy to reduce CRF. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the short- and long-term efficacy of light therapy on CRF and associated symptoms in chronically fatigued (non-)Hodgkin lymphoma survivors. Eighty-three survivors were exposed to bright white light (intervention) and another 83 survivors were exposed to dim white light (comparison). Results showed that all participants, irrespective of light condition, reported reduced levels of fatigue after the completion of light therapy. Similar results were found for depression, sleep quality, and some aspects of quality of life. No effect was found on circadian rhythms or objectively assessed sleep. Therefore, it is important to further investigate which aspects of intervention are associated with the improvements observed after light therapy. ABSTRACT: Purpose: To evaluate the short- and long-term effects of light therapy on fatigue (primary outcome) and sleep quality, depression, anxiety, quality of life, and circadian rhythms (secondary outcomes) in survivors of (non-)Hodgkin lymphoma presenting with chronic cancer-related fatigue. Methods: We randomly assigned 166 survivors (mean survival 13 years) to a bright white light intervention (BWL) or dim white light comparison (DWL) group. Measurements were completed at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), at three (T2), and nine (T3) months follow-up. A mixed-effect modeling approach was used to compare linear and non-linear effects of time between groups. Results: There were no significant differences between BWL and DWL in the reduction in fatigue over time. Both BWL and DWL significantly (p < 0.001) improved fatigue levels during the intervention followed by a slight reduction in this effect during follow-up (ES(T0-T1) = −0.71; ES(T1-T3) = 0.15). Similar results were found for depression, sleep quality, and some aspects of quality of life. Light therapy had no effect on circadian rhythms. Conclusions: BWL was not superior in reducing fatigue compared to DWL in HL and DLBCL survivors. Remarkably, the total sample showed clinically relevant and persistent improvements on fatigue not commonly seen in longitudinal observational studies in these survivors.","Starreveld, Daniëlle E.

We describe the clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging features of a subgroup of adults with central nervous system (CNS) infections caused by GBS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The database of the Singapore Neurologic Infections Program (SNIP), a national multicenter study for surveillance of infectious neurologic disease, was reviewed to select patients with GBS CNS infection during the outbreak. Cases were diagnosed on the basis of clinical features, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings and identification or isolation of Streptococcus agalactiae in the blood or CSF. Demographic, clinical and neuroradiological information was obtained prospectively and retrospectively abstracted. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (6 male, 8 female; median age, 58 years) presented with fever, meningism, headache, encephalopathy, focal neurological deficits, and/or seizures. All except two were previously healthy. Diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) on admission was abnormal in 13 patients, showing tiny hyperintensities in the subarachnoid space (7 patients), ventricles (6 patients) and brain parenchyma (8 patients); 5 patients had cerebellar abnormalities.

Around five million South Africans still do not have access to safe water. OBJECTIVE: This paper seeks to understand and advance processes to engage multisectoral stakeholders to respond to lack of safe water as a community-nominated health priority in rural South Africa. METHOD: We engaged representatives from Mpumalanga Department of Health (MDoH), rural communities, other government departments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to cooperatively generate, interpret and act on evidence addressing community-nominated priorities. A series of participatory workshops were conducted where stakeholders worked together as co-researchers to develop shared accounts of the problem, and recommendations to address it. Consensus on the problem, mapping existing planning and policy landscapes, and initiating constructive dialogue was facilitated through group discussions in a collective learning process. RESULTS: Community stakeholders nominated lack of safe water as a local priority public health issue and generated evidence on causes and contributors, and health and social impacts. Together with government and NGO stakeholders, this evidence was corroborated. Stakeholders developed a local action plan through consensus and feasibility appraisal. Actions committed to behavioural change and reorganization of existing services, were relevant to the needs of the local community and were developed with consideration of current policies and strategies. A positive, collective reflection was made on the process. The greatest gain reported was the development of dialogue in ‘safe spaces’ through which mutual understanding, insights into the functioning of other sectors and learning by doing were achieved. CONCLUSION: Our process reflected willingness and commitment among stakeholders to work together collectively addressing local water challenges.

Methods: Between 28-30 April 2020, a retrospective cohort study was conducted among pupils, their parents and relatives, and staff of primary schools exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020 in a city north of Paris, France. Participants completed a questionnaire that covered sociodemographic information and history of recent symptoms. A blood sample was tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a flow-cytometry-based assay. Results: The infection attack rate (IAR) was 45/510 (8.8%), 3/42 (7.1%), 1/28 (3.6%), 76/641 (11.9%) and 14/119 (11.8%) among primary school pupils, teachers, non-teaching staff, parents, and relatives, respectively (P = 0.29). Prior to school closure on February 14, three SARS-CoV-2 infected pupils attended three separate schools with no secondary cases in the following 14 days among pupils, teachers and non-teaching staff of the same schools. Familial clustering of cases was documented by the high proportion of antibodies among parents and relatives of infected pupils (36/59 = 61.0% and 4/9 = 44.4%, respectively).

The analysis of the applicability domain (AD) reveals coverage of about 90% for the external test set. Docking and molecular dynamic analysis are performed on the three most relevant biological targets for SARS-CoV-2: main protease, papain-like protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A screening of the DrugBank database is executed, predicting the pIC(50) value of 6664 drugs, which are IN the AD of the model (coverage = 79%). Fifty-seven possible potent anti-COVID-19 candidates with pIC(50) values > 6.6 are identified, and based on a pharmacophore modelling analysis, four compounds of this set can be suggested as potent candidates to be potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred patients who required PCNL were included in this study, and all patients were non-randomly distributed into two groups: counselled using only 3D-reconstructed computed tomography (CT) images (group 1) or using only the “InsKid” app (group 2). Patient data were obtained from CT scans as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format and converted into stereolithography (STL) format. All patients completed the questionnaire after counselling, and the results were compared between groups. RESULTS: Patients from group 2 better understood the anatomy of their affected kidney by 53%; awareness regarding their stone location was better by 32%; the steps of planned surgery, as well as possible complications, were more transparent for patients using the app by 24% and 56%, respectively. The number of patients who were dissatisfied with the mobile counselling dropped by 70%. The average duration of consultation with the 3D reconstruction of CT images was 10.9 ± 0.6 min, while counselling using our program reliably led to a reduction in this duration (7.3 ± 0.5 min). CONCLUSION: The InsKid app is a freely available, easy-to-use educational software that improves patient counselling without considerable financial expense or long waiting periods for use.","Guliev, B.; Komyakov, B.; Galfano, A.; Talyshinskii, A",Urology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32473936/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2020.04.114; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0090429520305379; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090429520305379?v=s5,352
634643,An Egocentric Network Contact Tracing Experiment: Testing Different Procedures to Elicit Contacts and Places,2021-02-04,"The global energy market is in a transition towards low carbon fuel systems to ensure the sustainable development of our society and economy. This can be achieved by converting the surplus renewable energy into hydrogen gas. The injection of hydrogen (⩽10% v/v) in the existing natural gas pipelines is demonstrated to have negligible effects on the pipelines and is a promising solution for hydrogen transportation and storage if the end-user purification technologies for hydrogen recovery from hydrogen enriched natural gas (HENG) are in place. In this review, promising membrane technologies for hydrogen separation is revisited and presented. Dense metallic membranes are highlighted with the ability of producing 99.9999999% (v/v) purity hydrogen product. However, high operating temperature (⩾300 °C) incurs high energy penalty, thus, limits its application to hydrogen purification in the power to hydrogen roadmap. Polymeric membranes are a promising candidate for hydrogen separation with its commercial readiness. However, further investigation in the enhancement of H(2)/CH(4) selectivity is crucial to improve the separation performance. The potential impacts of impurities in HENG on membrane performance are also discussed. The research and development outlook are presented, highlighting the essence of upscaling the membrane separation processes and the integration of membrane technology with pressure swing adsorption technology.

635860,Analysis of the Different Approaches Adopted in the Italian Regions to Care for Patients Affected by COVID-19,2021-01-20,"Objective: To study the correlation between the yield of virus-induced interferon (IFN) production in leukocyte cultures and the risk of recurrent respiratory infections. Methods: A sample of 71 consecutive children enrolled in the Finnish Otitis Media Cohort Study were selected. Children suffering from frequently recurring respiratory infections (FRRIs) were defined as the highest quintile of the entire cohort of 329 children, as regards the number of upper respiratory infections (URIs) and/or episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) during the follow-up period from 2 to 24 months. Results: In the sample of 71 children, there were 18 children with FRRI (≥9 URI and/or ≥4 AOM). Leukocyte cultures, prepared from blood drawn from these 18 children at 6 months of age, produced lower yields of IFN than those of the remaining 53 children, when stimulated with adenovirus (P<0.001), coronavirus (P<0.001) or rhinovirus (P=0.002). The difference in IFN yields was even greater (P<0.001 with all three viruses) if the comparison was made between children with FRRI and those with no or maximally one URI during the follow-up period. When the IFN production capacity induced by rhinovirus was measured at the age of 24 months, a statistically significant difference between the children with FRRI and the others was also seen (P=0.002). Influenza A virus-induced IFN production capacity did not differ between the groups at either age (P=0.209). Conclusions: Lowered IFN responses in children suffering from recurrent URIs and/or AOM may, in a subgroup of the children, be due to a genetic property of the child. However, because of the great interindividual variations, we cannot use the IFN production capacity as such for prediction of forthcoming respiratory infections and/or otitis media.","Pitkäranta, Anne; Nokso-Koivisto, Johanna; Jäntti, Virva; Takala, Aino; Kilpi, Terhi; Hovi, Tapani",J Clin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10614857/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653299000566; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653299000566,352

Whether standard thromboprophylaxis is sufficient or higher doses are needed, especially in severe patients, is unknown. To evaluate the safety of intermediate dose regimens of low-weight molecular heparin (LWMH) in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia, particularly in older patients. We retrospectively evaluated 105 hospitalized patients (61 M, 44 F; mean age 73.7 years) treated with subcutaneous enoxaparin: 80 mg/day in normal weight and mild-to-moderate impair or normal renal function; 40 mg/day in severe chronic renal failure or low bodyweight (< 45 kg); 100 mg/day if bodyweight was higher than 100 kg. All the patients had radiologically confirmed pneumonia and 63.8% had severe COVID-19. None of the patients had fatal haemorrhage; two (1.9%) patients had a major bleeding event (one spontaneous hematoma and one gastrointestinal bleeding). Only 6.7% of patients needed transfusions of red blood cells. One thrombotic event (pulmonary embolism) was observed. When compared to younger patients, patients older than 85 years had a higher mortality (40% vs 13.3%), but not an increased risk of bleeding or need for blood transfusion. The use of an intermediate dose of LWMH appears to be feasible and data suggest safety in COVID-19 patients, although further studies are needed.","Mattioli, Massimo; Benfaremo, Devis; Mancini, Mauro; Mucci, Luciano; Mainquà, Paola; Polenta, Antonio; Baldini, Patrizia Maria; Fulgenzi, Francesca; Dennetta, Donatella; Bedetta, Samuele; Gasperoni, Lorenzo; Caraffa, Alessandro; Frausini, Gabriele",Journal of Thrombosis and Thrombolysis,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11239-020-02243-z.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32794132/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11239-020-02243-z,352

METHODS: We surveyed participants with RA in a large health care system between July 16 and November 8, 2020. Participants reported RA treatment, COVID-19 risk perception, and shielding practices (eg, masks, social distancing, and quarantining). We examined the association of demographic and disease-specific factors with risk perception and the association of risk perception with shielding practices. RESULTS: Of 494 participants, 195 (40%), 169 (34%), and 130 (26%) strongly agreed, agreed, or were uncertain/disagreed that their RA put them at higher risk for COVID-19 or poor outcomes, respectively. Younger age (odds ratio [OR]: 0.98), having a comorbidity (OR: 1.60), and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) use (OR: 1.75) were independently associated with a higher perceived risk. Among those who strongly agreed, agreed, or were uncertain/disagreed that they had greater risk, 165 (85%), 118 (70%), and 69 (53%), respectively, practiced all three shielding measures (P < 0.0001). Those who strongly agreed or agreed that they were at higher risk were more likely to use all three shielding practices (OR: 4.16 and 1.97, respectively). bDMARD use and glucocorticoid use were associated with using all three shielding measures (OR: 1.99 and 1.81, respectively). CONCLUSION: Perception of COVID-19 risk among patients with RA varies substantially. Factors associated with perceived risk are different from those found to be associated with worse outcomes in observational studies. Greater perceived risk is associated with more strict shielding, which has implications for patient education and mental health.","Cook, Claire; Cox, Huel; Fu, Xiaoqing; Zhang, Yuqing; Stone, John H; Choi, Hyon K; Wallace, Zachary S",ACR open rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/acr2.11340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34498436/,352

Previous studies have revealed that some proteins in silkworm digestive juice show antiviral activity. In this study, antiviral activity examination of different resistant strains showed that the digestive juice of the resistant strain (A35) had higher inhibition to virus than the susceptible strain (P50). Subsequently, the label-free quantitative proteomics was used to study the midgut digestive juice response to BmNPV infection in P50 and A35 strains. A total of 98 proteins were identified, of which 80 were differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) with 54 enzymes and 26 nonenzymatic proteins by comparing the proteomes of infected and non-infected P50 and A35 silkworms. These DEPs are mainly involved in metabolism, proteolysis, neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, starch and sucrose metabolism and glutathione metabolism. After removing the genetic background and individual immune stress response proteins, 9 DEPs were identified potentially involved in resistance to BmNPV. Further studies showed that a serine protease, an alkaline phosphatase and serine protease inhibitor 2 isoform X1 were differentially expressed in A35 compared to P50 or post BmNPV infection. Taken together, these results provide insights into the potential mechanisms for silkworm digestive juice to provide resistance to BmNPV infection. Signifcance: Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is highly pathogenic, which has a great impact on the sericulture. BmNPV entered the midgut lumen and exposed to digestive juices after oral infection. Previous studies have revealed that some proteins in silkworm digestive juice show antiviral activity, however, current information on the digestive juice proteome of high resistant silkworm strain after BmNPV challenge compared to susceptible strain is incomprehensive. Here, we combined label-free quantification method, bioinformatics, RT-qPCR and western blot analysis and found that BmNPV infection causes some protein changes in the silkworm midgut digestive juice. The DEPs were identified in the digestive juices of different resistant strains following BmNPV infection, and screened out some proteins potentially related to resistance to BmNPV. Three important differentially expression proteins were validated by independent approaches. These findings uncover the potential role of silkworm digestive juice in providing resistance to BmNPV and supplemented the profile of the proteome of the digestive juices in B. mori.","Zhang, Shang-zhi; Wang, Jie; Zhu, Lin-bao; Toufeeq, Shahzad; Xu, Xin; You, Ling-ling; Li, Bing; Hu, Pei; Xu, Jia-ping",J Proteomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610263/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1874391919302994; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2019.103527; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874391919302994,352

METHODS: This trial was conducted in two stages. In the dose-escalation stage, patients with advanced ESCC refractory or intolerant to previous chemotherapy received escalating doses of LY01610. A recommended dose based on patient tolerance was then expanded in the second stage. LY01610 was administered intravenously every 2 weeks, except that the first cycle in dose escalation was 3 weeks to allow observation of DLTs. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled across 4 dose levels (30, 60, 90 and 120 mg/m(2)). The DLTs included vomiting and febrile neutropenia, and the MTD was 90 mg/m(2). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were leukopenia in six patients (25.0%), anemia in six patients (25.0%) and neutropenia in five patients (20.8%). One patient achieved complete response, and four had partial response, including one patient receiving LY01610 at the starting dose of 30 mg/m(2). Compared with conventional irinotecan, the PK profile of LY01610 was characterized by increased and prolonged exposure of total irinotecan and the active metabolite SN-38 in plasma. CONCLUSION: LY01610 demonstrated manageable toxicity and promising anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced ESCC. Future clinical development of LY01610 as single agent or in combination with other anti-cancer agents in treating ESCC patients is warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04088604 at ClinicalTrials.gov.

We examine how situations such as the current COVID-19 pandemic can exponentially increase moral distress in healthcare professionals. Then, we explore how moral resilience can help cope with moral distress. We propose the term collective moral resilience to capture the shared capacity arising from mutual engagement and dialogue in group settings, towards responding to individual moral distress and towards building an ethical practice environment.

Failed Entrepreneurs’ Optimism and Defensive Pessimism and Coping Humor as a Moderator,2021-06-30,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced many institutions to implement telemedicine to facilitate continued patient care at a distance. The quality of patient care with telemedicine in orthopedic oncology has not been assessed. Between March and June 2020, a telephone survey of 64 patients was conducted in an academic orthopedic oncology practice. Patient satisfaction was assessed with a Likert scale metric, open-ended feedback, and direct comparisons between telemedicine and in-office visits. Billing and collection financial data of the telemedicine cohort and of a separate cohort of in-office visits during the same time period were compared. The clinical competency of telemedicine visits was measured by delayed or missed diagnoses and surgical site infections that may be attributable to lack of an in-person physical examination. Overall, patients were largely satisfied with their telemedicine experience. More than 90% of patients described telemedicine as equal to or better than in-office visits regarding convenience, time, privacy, and overall quality. Patients reported that better assessment of their physical condition may be indicated, particularly in early postoperative and early sarcoma surveillance visits. Two of 64 patients had adverse events (both local recurrences) potentially attributable to lack of an in-person physical examination. Institutional financial reimbursement of telemedicine visits was comparable to that of in-office visits. These findings have supported continued use of telemedicine in our practice, particularly for patients traveling significant distance and those returning for sarcoma surveillance. However, the limitations of lack of an in-person physical examination should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

645264,A Typology of Poles’ Attitudes toward COVID-19 during the First Wave of the Pandemic,2021-02-19,"BACKGROUND: During the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly African-American or Hispanic communities were disproportionately impacted. We sought to better understand the epidemiology of COVID-19 among hospitalized Hispanic patients by comparing individual and census-tract level characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 to those diagnosed with influenza, another viral infection with respiratory transmission. We evaluated the temporal changes in epidemiology across race-ethnicity related to a shelter-in-place mandate. METHODS: We evaluated patients hospitalized at Cook County Health, the safety-net health system for the Chicago metropolitan area. Among self-identified hospitalized Hispanic patients, we compared those with influenza (2019-2020 influenza season) to COVID-19 infection during March 16, 2020 through May 11, 2020. We used multivariable analysis to identify differences in individual and census-tract level characteristics between the two groups. RESULTS: Relative to non-Hispanic blacks and whites, COVID-19 rapidly increased among Hispanics during promotion of social-distancing policies. Whereas non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to be hospitalized for influenza, Hispanic patients predominated among COVID-19 infections (40% relative increase compared to influenza). In the comparative analysis of influenza and COVID-19, Hispanic patients with COVID-19 were more likely to reside in census tracts with higher proportions of residents with the following characteristics: Hispanic; no high school diploma; non-US citizen; limited English speaking ability; employed in manufacturing or construction; and, overcrowding. By multivariable analysis, Hispanic patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to those with influenza were more likely to be male (adjusted OR=1.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.9) or obese (aOR=2.5; 95% CI 1.5 to 4.2), and to reside in a census tract with [≥]40% of residents without a high-school diploma (aOR=2.5; 95% CI 1.3 to 4.8). CONCLUSIONS: The rapid and disproportionate increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations among Hispanics after the shelter-in-place mandate indicates that public health strategies were inadequate in protecting this population. In particular, those residing in neighborhoods with lower levels of educational attainment.","Trick, W. E.; Badri, S.; Doshi, K.; Zhang, H.; Rezai, K.; Hoffman, M. J.; Weinstein, R.

645304,The Use of Online CB-ART Interventions in the Context of COVID-19: Enhancing Salutogenic Coping,2021-02-20,"INTRODUCTION: Elective repair versus watchful waiting remains controversial in paraesophageal hernia (PEH) patients. Generation of predictive factors to determine patients at greatest risk for emergent repair may prove helpful. The aim of this study was to evaluate patients undergoing elective versus emergent PEH repair and supplement this comparison with 3D volumetric analysis of hiatal defect area (HDA) and intrathoracic hernia sac volume (HSV) to determine risk factors for increased likelihood of emergent repair. METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively enrolled, single-center hernia database was performed on all patients undergoing elective and emergent PEH repairs. Patients with adequate preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging were analyzed using volumetric analysis software. RESULTS: Of the 376 PEH patients, 32 (8.5%) were emergent. Emergent patients had lower rates of preoperative heartburn (68.8%vs85.1%, p = 0.016) and regurgitation (21.9%vs40.2%, p = 0.04), with similar rates of other symptoms. Emergent patients more frequently had type IV PEHs (43.8%vs13.5%, p < 0.001). Volumetric analysis was performed on 201 patients, and emergent patients had a larger HSV (805.6 ± 483.5vs398.0 ± 353.1cm(3), p < 0.001) and HDA (41.7 ± 19.5vs26.5 ± 14.7 cm(2), p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, HSV increase of 100cm(3) (OR 1.17 CI 1.02–1.35, p = 0.022) was independently associated with greater likelihood of emergent repair. Post-operatively, emergent patients had increased length of stay, major complication rates, ICU utilization, reoperation, and mortality (all p < 0.05). Emergent group recurrence rates were higher and occurred faster secondary to increased use of gastropexy alone as treatment (p > 0.05). With a formal PEH repair, there was no difference in rate or timing of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Emergent patients are more likely to suffer complications, require ICU care, have a higher mortality, and an increased likelihood of reoperation. A graduated increase in HSV increasingly predicts the need for an emergent operation. Those patients presenting electively with a large PEH may benefit from early elective surgery.","Elhage, Sharbel A.; Kao, Angela M.; Katzen, Michael; Shao, Jenny M.; Prasad, Tanushree; Augenstein, Vedra A.; Heniford, B.

645400,Moving Average Based Index for Judging the Peak of the COVID-19 Epidemic,2020-07-22,"The currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has accounted for millions of infections and deaths across the globe. Genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are being published daily in public databases and the availability of these genome data sets has allowed unprecedented access to the mutational patterns of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. We made use of the same genomic information for conducting phylogenetic analysis and identifying lineage-specific mutations. The catalogued lineage-defining mutations were analyzed for their stabilizing or destabilizing impact on viral proteins. We recorded persistence of D614G, S477N, A222V, and V1176F variants and a global expansion of the PANGOLIN variant B.1. In addition, a retention of Q57H (B.1.X), R203K/G204R (B.1.1.X), T85I (B.1.2-B.1.3), G15S+T428I (C.X), and I120F (D.X) variations was observed. Overall, we recorded a striking balance between stabilizing and destabilizing mutations, therefore leading to well-maintained protein structures. With selection pressures in the form of newly developed vaccines and therapeutics to mount in the coming months, the task of mapping viral mutations and recording their impact on key viral proteins should be crucial to preemptively catch any escape mechanism for which SARS-CoV-2 may evolve.","Jacob, Jobin John; Vasudevan, Karthick; Pragasam, Agila Kumari; Gunasekaran, Karthik; Veeraraghavan, Balaji; Mutreja, Ankur",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34281387/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01188-21,352

COVID-19 may lead to a variety of complications, including rhabdomyolysis. Although rhabdomyolysis is a rare complication, it can lead to severe kidney damage. Recent studies suggest that rhabdomyolysis caused by SARS-CoV-2 is more common in middle-aged and older men with severe COVID-19. Herein we report a case of rhabdomyolysis in a young woman with moderate COVID-19. She had a habit of muscle training. She presented with moderate COVID-19 and acute rhabdomyolysis that required a large volume of fluid infusion in addition to dexamethasone and remdesivir. Clinicians should pay attention to the development of rhabdomyolysis in patients with COVID-19, especially those with a habit of strenuous exercise or muscle training, even if they are young and have moderate COVID-19.","Fujita, Kohei; Kanai, Osamu; Nanba, Kazutaka; Esaka, Naoki; Hata, Hiroaki; Seta, Koichi; Odagaki, Takao",IDCases,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214250921001682?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34221896/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idcr.2021.e01212; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214250921001682,352
646382,The Psychological Impact of Strict and Prolonged Confinement on Business Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic at a Spanish University,2021-02-10,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-stranded RNA virus belongs to Coronaviridae family. The viral genome of SARS-CoV-2 contains around 29.8 kilobase with a 5′-cap structure and 3′-poly-A tail, and shows 79.2% nucleotide identity with human SARS-CoV-1, which caused the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. As the successor to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 now has circulated across the globe. There is a growing understanding of SARS-CoV-2 in virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies. In this study, we verified the existence of two 18-22 nt small viral RNAs (svRNAs) derived from the same precursor in human specimens infected with SARS-CoV-2, including nasopharyngeal swabs and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) explanted lungs from lung transplantation of COVID-19 patients. We then simulated and confirmed the formation of these two SARS-CoV-2-Encoded small RNAs in human lung epithelial cells. And the potential pro-inflammatory effects of the splicing and maturation process of these two svRNAs in human lung epithelial cells were also explored. By screening cytokine storm genes and the characteristic expression profiling of COVID-19 in the explanted lung tissues and the svRNAs precursor transfected human lung epithelial cells, we found that the maturation of these two small viral RNAs contributed significantly to the infection associated lung inflammation, mainly via the activation of the CXCL8, CXCL11 and type I interferon signaling pathway. Taken together, we discovered two SARS-CoV-2-Encoded small RNAs and investigated the pro-inflammatory effects during their maturation in human lung epithelial cells, which might provide new insight into the pathogenesis and possible treatment options for COVID-19.","Cheng, Zhang; Cheng, Liu; Lin, Jiang; Lunbiao, Cui; Chunyu, Li; Guoxin, Song; Rui, Xu; Xiangnan, Geng; Changxing, Luan; Yan, Chen; Baoli, Zhu; Wei, Zhu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.16.444324,352

FM materials (FMMs) have to satisfy the medical device biocompatibility requirements as indicated in the technical standard EN ISO 10993-1:2018. The biologic evaluation must be confirmed by in vivo tests to verify cytotoxicity, sensitisation, and skin irritation. Some of these tests require an extensive period of time for their execution, which is incompatible with an emergency situation. In this study, we propose to verify the safety of FMMs combining the assessment of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) with quantification of nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), as predictive markers of skin sensitisation or irritation based on human primary fibroblasts. Two hundred and forty-two FMMs were collected and classified according to spectrometer IR in polypropylene, paper, cotton, polyester, polyethylene terephthalate, 3-dimensional printing, and viscose. Of all FMMs tested, 50.8% passed all the assays, 48% failed at least one, and only 1.2% failed all.

Recent structural data suggest that the spikes possess orientational freedom and the ribonucleoproteins segregate into basketlike structures. How these structural features regulate the dynamic and mechanical behavior of the native virion, however, remain unknown. By imaging and mechanically manipulating individual, native SARS-CoV-2 virions with atomic force microscopy, here we show that their surface displays a dynamic brush owing to the flexibility and rapid motion of the spikes. The virions are highly compliant and able to recover from drastic mechanical perturbations. Their global structure is remarkably temperature resistant, but the virion surface becomes progressively denuded of spikes upon thermal exposure. Thus, both the infectivity and thermal sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 rely on the dynamics and the mechanics of the virus. One sentence summary The native coronavirus 2 displays a dynamic surface layer of spikes, a large mechanical compliance and unique self-healing capacity.","Kiss, Bálint; Kis, Zoltán; Pályi, Bernadett; Kellermayer, Miklós S.Z.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.17.302380,352

It is particularly important for disease cohorts, as thoroughly detailed phenotypic profiles allow patients to be compared and contrasted. However, many disease cohorts contain patients that have been ascribed low numbers of very general and relatively uninformative phenotypes. We present Cohort Analyzer, a tool that measures the phenotyping quality of patient cohorts. It calculates multiple statistics to give a general overview of the cohort status in terms of the depth and breadth of phenotyping, allowing us to detect less well-phenotyped patients for re-examining or excluding from further analyses. In addition, it performs clustering analysis to find subgroups of patients that share similar phenotypic profiles. We used it to analyse three cohorts of genetic diseases patients with very different properties. We found that cohorts with the most specific and complete phenotypic characterization give more potential insights into the disease than those that were less deeply characterised by forming more informative clusters. For two of the cohorts, we also analysed genomic data related to the patients, and linked the genomic data to the patient-subgroups by mapping shared variants to genes and functions. The work highlights the need for improved phenotyping in this era of personalized medicine. The tool itself is freely available alongside a workflow to allow the analyses shown in this work to be applied to other datasets.","Rojano, Elena; Córdoba-Caballero, José; Jabato, Fernando M.; Gallego, Diana; Serrano, Mercedes; Pérez, Belén; Parés-Aguilar, Álvaro; Perkins, James R.; Ranea, Juan A.

655162,One-Year Lesson: Machine Learning Prediction of COVID-19 Positive Cases with Meteorological Data and Mobility Estimate in Japan,2021-05-27,"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: To control the spread of COVID‐19, India imposed a nationwide lockdown in phases including lockdown 1.0 (25 March–14 April) and 2.0 (15 April–3 May). Among other restrictions, it involved a complete ban of alcohol sales. We aimed to examine and interpret the changes in online search interest for keywords representing different alcohol‐related themes during the lockdown period in India. DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were extracted using the framework described for using Google Trends in health‐related research. The list of alcohol‐related search queries was prepared for four broad themes: types of alcoholic beverages consumed; means of accessing alcohol; problems experienced due to break in alcohol supply; and help‐seeking for alcohol use disorders. The mean relative search volumes across three time periods (pre‐lockdown; lockdown 1.0; lockdown 2.0) were compared using spss version 23.0. RESULTS: A significant increase in online search interest for keywords related to the procurement of alcohol was observed in lockdown 1.0 but not during lockdown 2.0, compared with pre‐lockdown. A significant increase in online search interest for alcohol withdrawal was observed during lockdown 1.0 compared to the pre‐lockdown period. A significant increase in online search interest for keywords representing benzodiazepines was observed in lockdown 2.0. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Indian internet users exhibited significantly increased online interest for alcohol‐related searches during lockdown. It seems that the challenges associated with offering interventions for alcohol use‐related problems are likely to continue once the lockdown is lifted and people have the option to access alcohol and treatment services freely.","Singh, Swarndeep; Sharma, Pawan; Balhara, Yatan Pal Singh",Drug Alcohol Rev,https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.13187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33090596/,352

Pediatric primary care is a viable setting for delivery of these interventions. OBJECTIVE: Previous meta-analyses have shown that behavioral interventions in primary care can improve clinical outcomes, but few reviews have been focused specifically on the implementation of parenting interventions in primary care. We aimed to fill this gap. DATA SOURCES: We reviewed 6532 unique peer-reviewed articles published in PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and PsycInfo. STUDY SELECTION: Articles were included if at least part of the intervention was delivered in or through primary care; parenting was targeted; and child-specific mental, emotional, and behavioral health outcomes were reported. DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were reviewed in Covidence by 2 trained coders, with a third coder arbitrating discrepancies. RESULTS: In our review of 40 studies, most studies were coded as a primary. Few researchers collected implementation outcomes, particularly those at the service delivery system level. LIMITATIONS: Including only published articles could have resulted in underrepresentation of implementation-related data. CONCLUSIONS: Parenting interventions delivered and implemented with fidelity in pediatric primary care could result in positive and equitable impacts on mental, emotional, and behavioral health outcomes for both parents and their children. Future research on the implementation strategies that can support adoption and sustained delivery of parenting interventions in primary care is needed if the field is to achieve population-level impact.","Smith, Justin D; Cruden, Gracelyn H; Rojas, Lourdes M; Van Ryzin, Mark; Fu, Emily; Davis, Matthew M; Landsverk, John; Brown, C Hendricks",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2019-3548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32581000/,352

In the current study, perception regarding the nature of the COVID-19 disease, susceptibility to its complications, and its relationship to seasonal influenza was investigated among the Jordanian population. METHODS: This was a survey-based cross-sectional study among public in Jordan. RESULTS: A total of 1863 participants agreed to participate in this questionnaire-based study. The results showed that more than half (55%) of the sample believed that COVID-19 is a naturally occurring virus which causes a serious and possibly fatal disease (50.7%). The majority (62.9%) did not accept that this disease is actually caused by bacteria, or is similar to seasonal influenza. Interestingly, 45.0% of the sampled population felt that the COVID-19 virus was engineered in the lab. Most of the participants (95%) agreed that the elderly or individuals with chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease were more susceptible to severe COVID-19 infections. With respect to symptoms, about two-thirds of the participants (65.2%) felt that the symptoms of COVID-19 are to a large extent similar to those of seasonal influenza. In addition, the majority (82.7%) believed that only some COVID-19 patients develop symptoms that can be described as severe. Factors such as age, gender, and education were found to modulate some of the perceptions of Jordanians regarding different aspects of COVID-19 disease.

The training program was aimed to enable PCDs identify, diagnose, and treat commonly presenting psychiatric disorders in primary care Methods PCDs had a brief onsite orientation program to psychiatric practice at National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS), followed by 10 months of online blended training. The online program followed the NIMHANS Virtual Knowledge- Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) model, that is, a hub and spokes model of training Results Twenty-two PCDs participated in this program. Eleven of them got accredited at the end. The onsite orientation consisted of exposure to various psychiatry facilities at NIMHANS, in addition to learning psychiatric history taking and mental status examination. The ECHO model of online learning consisted of fortnightly sessions, lasting 2 hours each. There were 20 such sessions. Each session consisted of a didactic lecture by the psychiatrist followed by a case discussion. The cases were presented by PCDs, moderated by the hub specialists (NIMHANS).

657753,COVID-19 Epidemic: Early Shift in the Socioeconomic Profile of the Affected Population,2021-03-19,"BACKGROUND: People 65 years or older are at greater risk of serious complications from the seasonal influenza compared with young. To promote elderly people’s behavioral compliance toward influenza prevention, the aim of the current project is to develop, implement, and evaluate a theory-based low-administration-cost intervention building on a leading psychological theory, the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA). METHODS: The target group is Hong Kong Chinese elderly people aged 65 or older who rarely or never adopt any preventive actions. This project will be conducted in three phases over 24 months. In phase 1, intervention program will be developed building on the HAPA theoretical framework which comprises both the initiation and maintenance of influenza prevention behaviors. In phase 2, intervention will be implemented and evaluated using a randomized controlled trial, including: (a) behavior initiation only, (b) behavior initiation + behavior maintenance, and (c) control group. Both the initiation and maintenance components will comprise weekly-delivered telephone-based individual intervention sessions in 3 months. In phase 3, outcome evaluation of behavioral and psychological variables and process evaluation will be conducted. The effectiveness of the intervention will be analyzed using a series of linear mixed models on each behavioral and psychological outcome variable. Structural equation modelling will be used to test the hypothesized theoretical sequence in the HAPA model. DISCUSSION: The proposed project is expected to design theory-based intervention materials to promote the influenza prevention behaviors in Hong Kong elderly people and provide information on its effectiveness and the potential changing mechanism of behavior initiation and maintenance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This randomized controlled trial was funded by the Health and Medical Research Fund (HMRF), Food and Health Bureau of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Ref: 16151222) and was registered on 13/10/2017 at CCRB Clinical Trials Registry of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, a Partner Registry of a WHO Primary Registry (Ref: CUHK_CCRB00567).","Zhang, Chun-Qing; Zhang, Ru; Chung, Pak-Kwong; Duan, Yanping; Lau, Joseph Tak fai; Chan, Derwin King Chung; Hagger, Martin S.",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-018-6146-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30400790/,352

SARS-CoV2 and SFTS viruses are deadly in nature, and there is a need for developing best treatments for them. Modern in silico approaches were found to be very handy in determining putative drug molecules. In this study, we analyze interaction of beta-sesquiphellandrene (compound belongs to ginger) with spike protein (Sp) and membrane glycoprotein polyprotein (MPp). RESULTS: Our molecular docking and simulation study reveals the perfect binding pocket of Sp and MPp holding beta-sesquiphellandrene (bS). Binding energies for MPp-bS and Sp-bS were found to be − 9.5 kcal/mol and − 10.3 kcal/mol respectively. RMSD and RMSF values for docked complexes were found to be in selectable range, i.e., 1 to 3 Å and 1 to 8 Å respectively. Modern computational tools were used here to make this investigation fast and effective. Further, ADME analysis reveals the therapeutic validations for beta-sesquiphellandrene to act as a useful pharmacoactive compound. Beta-sesquiphellandrene provides not only inhibitory effect on spike protein of SARS-CoV2 but also similar inhibitory effects on membrane glycoprotein polyprotein complex of SFTS virus, which hampers the pathological initiation of the diseases caused by both the viruses, i.e., COVID-19 and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. CONCLUSION: This method of computational analysis was found to be rapid and effective, and opens new doors in the domain of in silico drug discovery. Beta-sesquiphellandrene can be used as effective medicine to control these harmful pathogens after wet lab validations.","Joshi, Amit; Sunil Krishnan, G.; Kaushik, Vikas",J Genet Eng Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33245459/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s43141-020-00095-x,352
659265,The Prediction of Hepatitis E through Ensemble Learning,2020-12-28,"Similar to other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 must (1) enter a target/host cell, (2) reprogram it to ensure its replication, (3) exit the host cell, and (4) repeat this cycle for exponential growth. During the exit step, the virus hijacks the sophisticated machineries that host cells employ to correctly fold, assemble, and transport proteins along the exocytic pathway. Therefore, secretory pathway–mediated assemblage and excretion of infective particles represent appealing targets to reduce the efficacy of virus biogenesis, if not to block it completely. Here, we analyze and discuss the contribution of the molecular machines operating in the early secretory pathway in the biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and their relevance for potential antiviral targeting. The fact that these molecular machines are conserved throughout evolution, together with the redundancy and tissue specificity of their components, provides opportunities in the search for unique proteins essential for SARS-CoV-2 biology that could also be targeted with therapeutic objectives. Finally, we provide an overview of recent evidence implicating proteins of the early secretory pathway as potential antiviral targets with effective therapeutic applications.","Sicari, Daria; Chatziioannou, Aristotelis; Koutsandreas, Theodoros; Sitia, Roberto; Chevet, Eric",J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32725137/; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202006005,352

As most democratic governments refrain from enacting mandatory testing, a key emerging challenge is to increase voluntary participation. Using behavioural economics insights complemented with data from a novel survey in the US and a survey experiment in Luxembourg, we examine behavioural factors associated with the individual willingness to get tested (WTT). In our analysis, individual characteristics that correlate positively with WTT include age, altruism, conformism, the tendency to abide by government-imposed rules, concern about contracting COVID-19, and patience. Risk aversion, unemployment, and conservative political orientation correlate negatively with WTT. Building on and expanding these insights may prove fruitful for policy to effectively raise people's propensity to get tested.","Fallucchi, Francesco; Görges, Luise; Machado, Joël; Pieters, Arne; Suhrcke, Marc",Health Policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2021.05.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851021001317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34090724/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168851021001317,352

Dental patients and professionals have a high risk of the coronavirus infection and also have a huge responsibility to prevent its spread during emergency dental treatment over the period of the COVID-19 outbreak. AIM: Informing patients and dental practitioners about the novel coronavirus in an accurate and effective way is very important. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the quality of dentistry-related medical information about COVID-19 on YouTube as educational resources for dental practitioners. METHODS: YouTube was queried for the search phrases ‘COVID-19 and dental practice’, ‘SARS-Cov-2 and dental practice’ and ‘2019-COV-2 and dental practice’. The first 100 videos for each term were viewed and analysed by 3 independent investigators. The scope was limited to videos in English. RESULTS: The search phrases yielded 1102 videos, among which 802 videos were excluded and 300 videos screened. Fifty-five videos were included in the final analysis. Of the 55 videos, only 2 videos (3.6%) were found to be of good quality, while 24 videos (43.6%) were found to be of poor quality. CONCLUSION: YouTube is a popular video broadcast site and can provide both relevant educational information and the spreading of misinformation. Health professionals should play a more active role with regard to educative information given on social media, especially YouTube, during global disease outbreaks.","Yüce, Meltem Özden; Adalı, Emine; Kanmaz, Burcu",Ir J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-020-02312-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32700083/,352

With the increasing number of infected pregnant women, many physicians hypothesized the perinatal transmission as a potential route of transmission. Some cases of perinatal transmission have been described, but it is unclear if these occurred via the transplacental or the transcervical routes or through environmental exposure. In this report, we described a case of a female infant who was delivered by caesarean section at 34 weeks’ gestation to an infected mother. The neonate was transferred into the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Level 3, with the precaution of airborne and contact isolation. All required investigations were performed, including blood gases, nasopharyngeal swab, chest x-ray, and echocardiogram. On the fifth day of delivery, her investigations demonstrated a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Despite applying all recommended guidelines and following the treatment protocol, she developed severe respiratory symptoms with persistent pulmonary hypertension, which progressed significantly to her death.","Algadeeb, Kumail B; AlMousa, Haider H; AlKadhem, Sajjad M; Alduhilan, Mohammed O; Almatawah, Yameen",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083174/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10472,352

We propose a mathematical model with control strategies using two variables of controls that represent respectively, the treatment of patients infected with COVID-19 by subjecting them to quarantine within hospitals and special places and using masks to cover the sensitive body parts. Pontryagin’s Maximum principle is used to characterize the optimal controls and the optimality system is solved by an iterative method. Finally, numerical simulations are presented with controls and without controls. Our results indicate that the implementation of the strategy that combines all the control variables adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO), produces excellent results similar to those achieved on the ground in Morocco.","Kada, Driss; Kouidere, Abdelfatah; Balatif, Omar; Rachik, Mostafa; Labriji, El Houssine",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920308298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519111/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920308298; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110437,352

Outbreaks of new pathogens are often ignited by the emergence and transmission of mutant variants descended from wild-type strains circulating in the community. In this work we investigate the stochastic dynamics of the emergence of a novel disease strain, introduced into a population in which it must compete with an existing endemic strain. In analogy with past work on single-strain epidemic outbreaks, we apply a branching process approximation to calculate the probability that the new strain becomes established. As expected, a critical determinant of the survival prospects of any invading strain is the magnitude of its reproduction number relative to that of the background endemic strain. Whilst in most circumstances this ratio must exceed unity in order for invasion to be viable, we show that differential control scenarios can lead to less-fit novel strains invading populations hosting a fitter endemic one. This analysis and the accompanying findings will inform our understanding of the mechanisms that have led to past instances of successful strain invasion, and provide valuable lessons for thwarting future drug-resistant strain incursions.","Meehan, Michael T.; Cope, Robert C.; McBryde, Emma S.",J Theor Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519319304783; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519319304783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31816294/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.110109,352

Aberrant expression of cytokines can be indicative of anomalous behavior of the immunoregulatory system, as seen in various illnesses and conditions, such as cancer, autoimmunity, neurodegeneration and other physiological disorders. Cancer and autoimmune diseases are particularly adept at developing mechanisms to escape and modulate the immune system checkpoints, reflected by an altered cytokine profile. Cytokine profiling can provide valuable information for diagnosing such diseases and monitoring their progression, as well as assessing the efficacy of immunotherapeutic regiments. Toward this goal, there has been immense interest in the development of ultrasensitive quantitative detection techniques for cytokines, which involves technologies from various scientific disciplines, such as immunology, electrochemistry, photometry, nanotechnology and electronics. This review focusses on one aspect of this collective effort: electrochemical biosensors.

A focus on social networks allowed drug users to discuss, share opinions and provide advice during a worldwide emergency context. In order to explore COVID-19-related implications on drug trends/behaviour and on most popular psychotropic substances debated, the focus here was on the constantly updated, very popular, Reddit social platform’s posts and comments. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of r/Drugs and related subreddits, using a social media listening netnographic approach, was carried out. The post/comments analysed covered the time-frame December 2019–May 2020. Between December 2019 and May 2020, the number of whole r/Drugs subreddit members increased from 619,563 to 676,581 members, respectively, thus increasing by 9.2% by the end of the data collection. Both the top-level r/Drugs subreddit and 92 related subreddits were quantitatively analysed, with posts/comments related to 12 drug categories. The drugs most frequently commented on included cannabinoids, psychedelics, opiates/opioids, alcohol, stimulants and prescribed medications. The qualitative analysis was carried out focussing on four subreddits, relating to some 1685 posts and 3263 comments. Four main themes of discussion (e.g., lockdown-associated immunity and drug intake issues; drug-related behaviour/after-quarantine plans’ issues; lockdown-related psychopathological issues; and peer-to-peer advice at the time of COVID-19) and four categories of Redditors (e.g., those continuing the use of drugs despite the pandemic; the “couch epidemiologists”; the conspirationists/pseudo-science influencers; and the recovery-focused users) were tentatively identified here.

Results from an Online Survey in Six European Countries and Implications for Future Research, Policy and Practice",2020-09-10,"BACKGROUND: Long term care (LTC) facilities provide health services and assist residents with daily care. At times residents may require transfer to emergency departments (ED), depending on the severity of their change in health status, their goals of care, and the ability of the facility to care for medically unstable residents. However, many transfers from LTC to ED are unnecessary, and expose residents to discontinuity in care and iatrogenic harms. This knowledge translation project aims to implement a standardized LTC-ED care and referral pathway for LTC facilities seeking transfer to ED, which optimizes the use of resources both within the LTC facility and surrounding community. METHODS/DESIGN: We will use a quasi-experimental randomized stepped-wedge design in the implementation and evaluation of the pathway within the Calgary zone of Alberta Health Services (AHS), Canada. Specifically, the intervention will be implemented in 38 LTC facilities. The intervention will involve a standardized LTC-ED care and referral pathway, along with targeted INTERACT® tools. The implementation strategies will be adapted to the local context of each facility and to address potential implementation barriers identified through a staff completed barriers assessment tool. The evaluation will use a mixed-methods approach. The primary outcome will be any change in the rate of transfers to ED from LTC facilities adjusted by resident-days. Secondary outcomes will include a post-implementation qualitative assessment of the pathway. Comparative cost-analysis will be undertaken from the perspective of publicly funded health care. DISCUSSION: This study will integrate current resources in the LTC-ED pathway in a manner that will better coordinate and optimize the care for LTC residents experiencing an acute change in health status.

This enables cells to communicate and respond to external environments, maintain cellular homeostasis, and transduce signals. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a family of receptors with seven transmembrane alpha-helical domains (7TM receptors) expressed at the cell surface, where they regulate physiological and pathological cellular processes. Several herpesviruses encode receptors (vGPCRs) which benefits the virus by avoiding host immune surveillance, supporting viral dissemination, and thereby establishing widespread and lifelong infection, processes where receptor signaling and/or endocytosis seem central. vGPCRs are rising as potential drug targets as exemplified by the cytomegalovirus-encoded receptor US28, where its constitutive internalization has been exploited for selective drug delivery in virus infected cells. Therefore, studying GPCR trafficking is of great importance. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge of endocytic and cell localization properties of vGPCRs and methodological approaches used for studying receptor internalization. Using such novel approaches, we show constitutive internalization of the BILF1 receptor from human and porcine γ-1 herpesviruses and present motifs from the eukaryotic linear motif (ELM) resources with importance for vGPCR endocytosis.","Mavri, Maša; Spiess, Katja; Rosenkilde, Mette Marie; Rutland, Catrin Sian; Vrecl, Milka; Kubale, Valentina",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25235710; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33287269/,352

We investigated global patterns of genetic variation and signatures of natural selection at host genes relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection (ACE2, TMPRSS2, DPP4, and LY6E). We analyzed novel data from 2,012 ethnically diverse Africans, 15,997 individuals of European (7,061) and African (8,916) ancestry recruited by the Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB), and comparative data from 2,504 individuals from the 1000 Genomes project. At ACE2 we identified 41 non-synonymous variants, found to be at low frequency in most populations. However, three non-synonymous variants were frequent among Central African hunter-gatherers (CAHG) from Cameroon, and signatures of positive selection could be detected on haplotypes encompassing those variants. We also detected signatures of positive selection for variants at regulatory regions upstream of ACE2 in diverse African populations. At TMPRSS2, we identified 48 non-synonymous variants, several of which are common in global populations, and 13 amino acid changes that are fixed in the human lineage after divergence from Chimpanzee. At DPP4 and LY6E most variants were rare in global populations indicating that purifying selection is acting at these loci. At all four loci, we identified common non-coding variants associated with gene expression that vary in frequency across global populations. By analyzing electronic health records from the PMBB we discovered genetic associations with clinical phenotypes, such as respiratory failure with ACE2 and upper respiratory tract infection with DPP4. Our study provides new insights into global variation at genes potentially affecting susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zhang, Chao; Verma, Anurag; Feng, Yuanqing; Melo, Marcelo C.

RESULTS: Of the 318 respondents, 77.3% (n=246) had heard about the app, but only 11.3% (n=36) had downloaded it, and 4.7% (n=15) were still using it at the time of the survey. Among the 210 participants who had heard about the app but did not download it, the main reasons for not using the app were a belief that it was not effective given its limited diffusion (n=37, 17.6%), a lack of interest (n=37, 17.6%), and distrust in the data security and fear of being geolocated (n=33, 15.7%). Among the 72 students who had not heard of the app and were given a brief description of its functioning and confidentiality policy, 52.7% (n=38) said they would use it. Participants reported that the main solution for increasing the use of the app would be better communication about it (227/318, 71.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Even among health students, the contact tracing app was poorly used. The findings suggest that improved communication about its advantages and simplicity of use as well as clarifying false beliefs about it could help improve uptake.","Montagni, Ilaria; Roussel, Nicolas; Thiébaut, Rodolphe; Tzourio, Christophe",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33566793/; https://doi.org/10.2196/26399,352

DESIGN: Systematic mapping and in-depth review. Data sources: Pubmed, Global Health, PsychInfo, ReliefWeb, OpenGrey (grey literature), Google Scholar, Web of Science (Social Science Index) Eligibility criteria: a structured search strategy was systematically applied to 17 databases as well as registers, websites and other resources to identify materials published between 1 January 2005 and 15 May 2019. Data extraction and synthesis: Those resources that met the inclusion criteria underwent a comprehensive full-text review. A detailed matrix was developed and key data from each resource were extracted to allow for the assessment of patterns in thematic areas. RESULTS: A total of 2108 documents were screened. Overall, 145 documents and 112 tools were reviewed, representing 10 different humanitarian sectors. While numerous resources exist, many lack sufficient information on how to monitor outputs or outcomes of GBV risk mitigation activities. There is also limited guidance on how to integrate the measurement of GBV risk mitigation into existing monitoring and evaluation frameworks. Those reports that aimed to measure GBV risk mitigation activities mostly employed qualitative methods and few measured the impact of a GBV risk mitigation with robust research designs. CONCLUSIONS: Recent efforts to adapt humanitarian response to COVID-19 have highlighted new and existing challenges for GBV risk mitigation. There is a significant gap in the evidence base around the effectiveness of GBV risk mitigation across all sectors. Understanding and strengthening measurement approaches in GBV risk mitigation remains a critical task for humanitarian response.","Kelly, Jocelyn TD; Ausubel, Emily; Kenny, Emma; Blake, Meredith; Heckman, Christine; Rastogi, Sonia; Sharma, Vandana",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050887; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34497084/,352
671590,The Relationship between Nature Deprivation and Individual Wellbeing across Urban Gradients under COVID-19,2021-02-05,"Disulfides are conventionally viewed as structurally stabilizing elements in proteins but emerging evidence suggests two disulfide subproteomes exist. One group mediates the well known role of structural stabilization. A second redox-active group are best known for their catalytic functions but are increasingly being recognized for their roles in regulation of protein function. Redox-active disulfides are, by their very nature, more susceptible to reduction than structural disulfides; and conversely, the Cys pairs that form them are more susceptible to oxidation. In this study, we searched for potentially redox-active Cys Pairs by scanning the Protein Data Bank for structures of proteins in alternate redox states. The PDB contains over 1134 unique redox pairs of proteins, many of which exhibit conformational differences between alternate redox states. Several classes of structural changes were observed, proteins that exhibit: disulfide oxidation following expulsion of metals such as zinc; major reorganisation of the polypeptide backbone in association with disulfide redox-activity; order/disorder transitions; and changes in quaternary structure. Based on evidence gathered supporting disulfide redox activity, we propose disulfides present in alternate redox states are likely to have physiologically relevant redox activity.","Fan, Samuel W; George, Richard A; Haworth, Naomi L; Feng, Lina L; Liu, Jason Y; Wouters, Merridee A",Protein Science,https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.175; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2776962?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19598234/,352

Briefly, RT-PCR was performed with the viral RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs as template to amplify conserved regions in the viral genome. Next, PfAgo, guide DNAs and molecular beacons in appropriate buffer were added to the PCR products, followed by incubating at 95 °C for 20–30 min. Subsequently, the fluorescence signal was detected. This method was named as SARS-CoV-2 PAND. The whole procedure is accomplished in approximately an hour with the using time of the Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR instrument shortened from >1 h to only 3–5 min per batch in comparison with RT-qPCR, hence the shortage of the expensive Real-time PCR instrument is alleviated. Moreover, this platform was also applied to identify SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutant due to its single-nucleotide specificity. The diagnostic results of clinic samples with SARS-CoV-2 PAND displayed 100% consistence with RT-qPCR test.","Wang, Fei; Yang, Jun; He, Ruyi; Yu, Xiao; Chen, Shuliang; Liu, Yang; Wang, Longyu; Li, Aitao; Liu, Linlin; Zhai, Chao; Ma, Lixin",Biosens Bioelectron,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566320309179; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.112932; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566320309179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33429204/,352

Aims. − To assess the burden and impact of cardiovascular comorbidities in women with COVID-19. Methods. − All consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 across 24 hospitals from 26 February to 20 April 2020 were included. The primary composite outcome was transfer to an intensive care unit or in-hospital death. Results. − Among 2878 patients, 1212 (42.1%) were women. Women were older (68.3 ± 18.0 vs 65.4 ± 16.0 years; P < 0.001), but had less prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities than men. Among women, 276 (22.8%) experienced the primary outcome, including 161 (13.3%) transfers to an intensive care unit and 115 (9.5%) deaths without transfer to intensive care unit. The rate of in-hospital death or transfer to an intensive care unit was lower in women versus men (crude hazard ratio [HR] 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53–0.72). Age (adjusted HR 1.05 per 5-year increase, 95% CI 1.01–1.10), body mass index (adjusted HR 1.06 per 2-unit increase, 95% CI 1.02–1.10), chronic kidney disease (adjusted HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.11–2.22) and heart failure (adjusted HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.04–2.22) were independently associated with the primary outcome in women. Elevated B-type natriuretic peptide/N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (adjusted HR 2.41, 95% CI 1.70–3.44) and troponin (adjusted HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.39–2.88) concentrations at admission were also associated with the primary outcome, even in women free of previous coronary artery disease or heart failure.

METHODS: Patients with RA, PsA or axial SpA (axSpA) prospectively followed in the nationwide DANBIO registry answered online questionnaires and reported patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in June and November 2020. Patient characteristics, disease activity and physical consultations in the clinic before and during the pandemic were identified in DANBIO [all patients and subgroups with early disease (disease duration ≤2 years)]. In individual patients, changes in PROs before and during the pandemic were calculated. Characteristics of patients with/without physical consultations were described (age, gender, education level, comorbidities, disease duration, treatment). RESULTS: We included 7836 patients (22% of eligible patients), 12% of which had early disease. PROs were stable before and during the pandemic, with median changes approximating zero, as well as in patients with early disease. Remission rates were stable. The relative decrease in the number of patients with physical consultations was 21–72%, which was highest in axSpA. Characteristics of patients with/without physical consultations were similar. Self-reported satisfaction with treatment options and access was >70%; the preferred contact form was physical consultation (66%). CONCLUSION: In this nationwide study performed during the first 8 months of the pandemic, patient satisfaction was high and the PROs and remission rates remained stable despite the remarkable reduction in physical consultations, as well as in patients with early disease.

Fifteen pregnant 3-month-old Wistar rats were separated into 3 groups. On the 15th and 17th day of pregnancy all animals received an intravenous administration of 1 ml of 15 mg of NCs (Group A), 1 ml of 5 mg NCs (Group B) while Control group received 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl. On the 14th and 17th of pregnancy ultrasonography was performed and the parameters evaluated were the width of placenta, the length and width of the embryonic sac, the foetus length and the heart rate. On parturition the number of pups per dam was evaluated. Half of the pups were euthanised the day after parturition and their liver and kidney was histologically evaluated and for the rest of the pups the body growth curve was evaluated until the age of 14 week. At the end of the 14th week the remaining pups were euthanised and their liver and kidney was histologically evaluated. At weaning the dams were euthanised and their liver and kidney was histologically evaluated. Ultrasonography: Baseline measurements of the width of placenta, the length and width of embryonic sac, the foetus length and the heart rate on the 14th day of pregnancy, revealed no statistical significant differences between groups. Comparison of the same values on the 17th day of pregnancy after 2 intravenous administrations of NCs showed no statistical significant effect on the respective parameters. The administration of NCs had no impact on the mean number of pups per dam. Additionally, no impact of the NCs on the body weights of the pups was observed on the 1st day after parturition. Moreover, comparisons between groups, for both sexes showed no difference on growth rate. During the histological evaluation no inflammatory, degenerative or neoplastic lesions were observed as far as the newborn, adult offspring and dams were concerned.

The conditions that made co‐production emerge are likely to change, as emergency regulations and funds are abandoned and as the sense of urgency disappears. Areas of public life where there could be a more lasting effect are those where the basic conditions for successful co‐production are already in place and where only a push was necessary for co‐production to take off.

We outline the perception of medical students and residents on the use of virtual-interview for residency applications in lieu of in-person interviews. METHODS: We obtained 1824 responses from medical students and residents through an online questionnaire between March2019-Feb2020 in Texas-United States. The survey had 11 statements (five in favor of in-person interviews and 6 in favor of virtual interviews) that respondents could rank on a 5-point Likert scale. All statements’ scores were summed based on the response given by each participant to create a total score between 11 and 55. The perception of the two groups was analyzed using an independent sample T-test and ANOVA. RESULTS: We received a total of 1711 responses from medical students and 113 from medical residents. Respondents were more female (82.2% of medical students and 47.8% of residents), with a mean age of 22.87±3.42 years old for medical students and 28.72±4.35 years old for residents. Both groups preferred in-person interviews; however, the residents were significantly more in favor (P = 0.03). Both groups agree that virtual-interviews should be as an option, though this was considerably higher in the medical students (P = 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, “travel distance” and “type of medical school” had a significant impact on choosing the virtual-interviews in both groups (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In-person interviews are favored by both medical students and residents compared to virtual-interview services in normal circumstances. However, both groups agree that programs should offer the option of having virtual-interviews as an available choice. Distance to an interview location and the type of medical school were the factors that had a significant impact on perception of using virtual-interviews. Knowing about the applicants’ attitude toward residency interviews and the national circumstances are essential when preparing the interview guides. Our findings are limited by the small sample size and the low response rate. Further extensive studies are warranted to better understand the perception of residency applicants toward virtual-interviews to improve the interview process in the United States.","Seifi, Ali; Mirahmadizadeh, Alireza; Eslami, Vahid",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32866220/,352

Efforts are needed to develop rapid and accurate diagnostic tools for extensive testing allowing for effective containment of the infection, via timely identification and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 carriers. Current gold standard nucleic acid tests require many separate steps that need trained personnel to operate specialist instrumentation in laboratory environments, hampering turnaround time and test accessibility, especially in low-resource settings. We devised an integrated on-chip platform coupling RNA extraction based on immiscible filtration assisted by surface tension (IFAST), with RNA amplification and detection via colorimetric reverse-transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), using two sets of primers targeting open reading frame1a (ORF1a) and nucleoprotein (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2. Results were identified visually, with a colour change from pink to yellow indicating positive amplification, and further confirmed by DNA gel electrophoresis. The specificity of the assay was tested against HCoV-OC43 and H1N1 RNAs. The assay based on use of gene N primers was 100% specific to SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity to HCoV-OC43 nor H1N1. Proof-of-concept studies on water and artificial sputum containing genomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA showed our IFAST RT-LAMP device to be capable of extracting and detecting 470 SARS-CoV-2 copies mL(-1) within 1 h (from sample-in to answer-out). IFAST RT-LAMP is a simple-to-use, integrated, rapid and accurate COVID-19 diagnostic platform, which could provide an attractive means for extensive screening of SARS-CoV-2 infections at point-of-care, especially in resource-constrained settings.","Rodriguez-Mateos, Pablo; Ngamsom, Bongkot; Walter, Cheryl; Dyer, Charlotte E.; Gitaka, Jesse; Iles, Alexander; Pamme, Nicole",Anal Chim Acta,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2021.338758; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003267021005845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34482896/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267021005845?v=s5,352

Project,2021-02-02,"BACKGROUND: To determine the diagnostic value of hematologic markers for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) and explore their relationship with disease severity. METHODS: Subjects included 190 COVID‐19 patients, 190 healthy subjects, and 105 influenza pneumonia (IP) patients. COVID‐19 patients were divided into the ARDS and non‐ARDS groups. Routine blood examination, biochemistry indicator, days in hospital, body temperature, pneumonia severity index (PSI), CURB‐65, and MuLBSTA were recorded. Correlations between variables were assessed using Spearman's correlation analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to study the accuracy of the various diagnostic tests. RESULTS: Compared with healthy subjects, COVID‐19 patients had lower white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte, platelet, and hemoglobin levels; higher percentages of neutrophils and monocytes; lower percentages of lymphocytes and higher neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and platelet‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (PLR) values (P < .05). COVID‐19 patients had higher WBC and neutrophil levels and lower percentages of lymphocytes compared to IP (P < .05). ROC curve analysis revealed that MLR had a high diagnostic value in differentiating COVID‐19 patients from healthy subjects, but not from IP patients. NLR showed significant positive correlations with PSI, CURB‐65, and MuLBSTA. Lymphocyte count was lower in the ARDS group and yielded a higher diagnostic value than the other variables. CONCLUSIONS: Monocyte‐to‐lymphocyte ratio showed an acceptable efficiency to separate COVID‐19 patients from healthy subjects, but failed to rule out IP patients. NLR may be a reliable marker to evaluate the disease severity of COVID‐19. Lymphocyte count may be useful to establish the early diagnosis of ARDS in the COVID‐19 patients.","Peng, Junnan; Qi, Di; Yuan, Guodan; Deng, Xinyu; Mei, Ying; Feng, Longhua; Wang, Daoxin",J Clin Lab Anal,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32681559/,352

An essential strategy to improve AKI patients’ prognoses is finding optimal biomarkers to identify AKI in a timely manner. Procalcitonin (PCT), a well-recognized biomarker for diagnosing infection and guiding antibiotics therapy, has been proposed to predict AKI development and recovery in many clinical settings. The current review provides comprehensive and updated information from relevant studies to evaluate PCT’s AKI-predictive ability and the influence of infection on this predictive ability. PCT has demonstrated optimal predictive ability for AKI in various populations irrespective of infection. However, the predictive ability seems to be blunted by infection since infection and inflammation have a more potent influence than AKI on PCT elevation. We furthermore explain the complicated association between elevated PCT levels and AKI in infection and inflammation situations and recommend directions for further investigations to clarify the essential issue. In conclusion, although conflicting data exist, serum PCT level is a potential biomarker for predicting AKI in many clinical settings regardless of infection. Nevertheless, further studies are warranted to clarify the association between PCT, infection, and AKI and to confirm the utilization of PCT for AKI prediction.","Kan, Wei-Chih; Huang, Ya-Ting; Wu, Vin-Cent; Shiao, Chih-Chung",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22136903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34199069/,352

METHODS: Numbers of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) activations, ST elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMIs) in a large tertiary Greater London centre and a large district general hospital, both of which have on-site heart attack centres, were collected. We compared the number of PPCI activations, STEMI, NSTEMIs and all MIs prior to the COVID-19 era (January to third week of February 2020), after the start of some COVID-19 restrictions taking place (fourth week of February 2020) and after formal instruction by the United Kingdom Government that all citizens were to observe strict social distancing measures (20 March 2020). We further obtained data for the corresponding weekly figures from 2019. RESULTS: The average weekly figure of all myocardial infarction in 2020, prior to the COVID-19 social distancing restrictions/awareness in the UK (beginning of January to third week of February), did not differ when compared with corresponding weeks in 2019 (23.3 ± 5.4 in 2019 versus 21.13 ± 3.5, p = 0.411).

683649,Gender Effect on Political Leaders’ Nonverbal Communicative Structure during the COVID-19 Crisis,2020-10-24,"INTRODUCTION: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks are often the result of trauma or recent surgical procedures; however, a subset can develop from non-traumatic etiologies. Cerebrospinal fluid leaks from congenital and spontaneous encephaloceles can be clinically occult and have devastating consequences if undetected for prolonged periods of time. This report highlights a unique case of meningitis after CSF leak caused by ruptured congenital meningocele during a routine nasopharyngeal swab. CASE REPORT: A 54-year-old female with diagnosed CSF leak presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute onset of severe headache, and neck and back pain. Prior to this presentation, the patient had experienced two months of persistent headache and rhinorrhea since her coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) nasopharyngeal swab. As part of her outpatient workup, an otolaryngology consultation with subsequent beta-2 transferrin testing and magnetic resonance imaging was performed and she was diagnosed with a CSF leak from ruptured congenital meningocele. On ED presentation, she was afebrile, but with mild tachycardia, leukocytosis, and meningismus. Lumbar puncture revealed acute streptococcal meningitis. This patient’s meningitis developed due to prolonged occult CSF leak after her COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab ruptured a pre-existing congenital meningocele. CONCLUSION: Nasopharyngeal swabs are being performed much more frequently due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All front-line providers should be aware of the potential presence and rupture of congenital meningoceles in patients who have undergone recent nasopharyngeal swab when risk-stratifying for potential CSF leak and meningitis.","Holmes, Alexandria; Allen, Bryant",Clin Pract Cases Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34437043/; https://doi.org/10.5811/cpcem.2021.5.52232,352

ReFOLD3 achieves improved performance by using an iterative refinement protocol to fix incorrect residue contacts and local errors, including unusual bonds and angles, which are identified in the submitted models by our leading ModFOLD8 model quality assessment method. Following refinement, the likely resulting improvements to the submitted models are recognized by ModFOLD8, which produces both global and local quality estimates. During the CASP14 prediction season (May–Aug 2020), we used the ReFOLD3 protocol to refine hundreds of 3D models, for both the refinement and the main tertiary structure prediction categories. Our group improved the global and local quality scores for numerous starting models in the refinement category, where we ranked in the top 10 according to the official assessment. The ReFOLD3 protocol was also used for the refinement of the SARS-CoV-2 targets as a part of the CASP Commons COVID-19 initiative, and we provided a significant number of the top 10 models.

Trilaciclib protects haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from chemotherapy‐induced damage (myeloprotection). To assess the totality of the myeloprotective benefits of trilaciclib, including analysis of several clinically relevant but low‐frequency events, an exploratory composite endpoint comprising five major adverse haematological events (MAHE) was prospectively defined: all‐cause hospitalisations, all‐cause chemotherapy dose reductions, febrile neutropenia (FN), prolonged severe neutropenia (SN) and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions on/after Week 5. MAHE and its individual components were assessed in three randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled Phase 2 trials in patients receiving a platinum/etoposide or topotecan‐containing chemotherapy regimen for ES‐SCLC and in data pooled from the three trials. A total of 242 patients were randomised across the three trials (trilaciclib, n = 123; placebo, n = 119). In the individual trials and the pooled analysis, administering trilaciclib prior to chemotherapy resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the cumulative incidence of MAHE compared to placebo. In the pooled analysis, the cumulative incidences of all‐cause chemotherapy dose reductions, FN, prolonged SN and RBC transfusions on/after Week 5 were significantly reduced with trilaciclib vs placebo; however, no significant difference was observed in rates of all‐cause hospitalisations. Additionally, compared to placebo, trilaciclib significantly extended the amount of time patients remained free of MAHE. These data support the myeloprotective benefits of trilaciclib and its ability to improve the overall safety profile of myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens used to treat patients with ES‐SCLC.","Dómine Gómez, Manuel; Csőszi, Tibor; Jaal, Jana; Kudaba, Iveta; Nikolov, Krasimir; Radosavljevic, Davorin; Xiao, Jie; Horton, Janet K.; Malik, Rajesh K.; Subramanian, Janakiraman",Int J Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.33705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34109630/,352
686524,Chest CT Computerized Aided Quantification of PNEUMONIA Lesions in COVID-19 Infection: A Comparison among Three Commercial Software,2020-09-22,"Objectives As of August 24th 2020, there have been 1,084,904 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 and 24,683 deaths across the African continent. Despite relatively lower numbers of cases initially, many African countries are now experiencing an exponential increase in case numbers. Estimates of the progression of disease and potential impact of different interventions are needed to inform policy making decisions. Herein, we model the possible trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in 52 African countries under different intervention scenarios. Design We developed a compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to estimate the COVID-19 case burden for all African countries while considering four scenarios: no intervention, moderate lockdown, hard lockdown, and hard lockdown with continued restrictions once lockdown is lifted. We further analyzed the potential impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations affected by HIV/AIDS and TB. Results In the absence of an intervention, the most populous countries had the highest peaks in active projected number of infections with Nigeria having an estimated 645,081 severe infections. The scenario with a hard lockdown and continued post-lockdown interventions to reduce transmission was the most efficacious strategy for delaying the time to the peak and reducing the number of cases. In South Africa projected peak severe infections increase from 162,977 to 203,261, when vulnerable populations with HIV/AIDS and TB are included in the analysis. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading across the African continent. Estimates of the potential impact of interventions and burden of disease are essential for policy makers to make evidence-based decisions on the distribution of limited resources and to balance the economic costs of interventions with the potential for saving lives.","Frost, I.; Craig, J.; Osena, G.; Hauck, S.; Kalanxhi, E.; Schueller, E.; Gatalo, O.; Yany, Y.; Tseng, K.; Lin, G.; Klein, E.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188102; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.04.20188102v1?rss=1,352
686887,Hand-Washing Practices among Adolescents Aged 12–15 Years from 80 Countries,2020-12-27,"There is no doubt that the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 is mutating and thus has the potential to adapt during the current pandemic. Whether this evolution will lead to changes in the transmission, the duration, or the severity of the disease is not clear. This has led to considerable scientific and media debate, from raising alarms about evolutionary change to dismissing it. Here we review what little is currently known about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and extend existing evolutionary theory to consider how selection might be acting upon the virus during the COVID-19 pandemic. While there is currently no definitive evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing further adaptation, continued, evidence-based, analysis of evolutionary change is important so that public health measures can be adjusted in response to substantive changes in the infectivity or severity of COVID-19.","Day, Troy; Gandon, Sylvain; Lion, Sébastien; Otto, Sarah P.",Curr Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32750338/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960982220308472; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.06.031; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220308472?v=s5,352
688405,Is It Possible to Be Happy during the COVID-19 Lockdown? A Longitudinal Study of the Role of Emotional Regulation Strategies and Pleasant Activities in Happiness,2021-03-19,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the effects of amoxicillin treatment in adult patients presenting to primary care with a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) who were infected with a potential bacterial, viral, or mixed bacterial/viral infection. METHODS: This multicentre randomized controlled trial focused on adults with LRTI not suspected for pneumonia. Patients were randomized to receive either antibiotic (amoxicillin 1 g) or placebo three times daily for 7 consecutive days using computer-generated random numbers (follow-up 28 days). In this secondary analysis of the trial, symptom duration (primary outcome), symptom severity (scored 0–6), and illness deterioration (reconsultation with new or worsening symptoms, or hospital admission) were analysed in pre-specified subgroups using regression models. Subgroups of interest were patients with a (strictly) bacterial, (strictly) viral, or combined infection, and patients with elevated values of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, or blood urea nitrogen. RESULTS: 2058 patients (amoxicillin n = 1036; placebo n = 1022) were randomized. Treatment did not affect symptom duration (n = 1793). Patients from whom a bacterial pathogen only was isolated (n = 207) benefited from amoxicillin in that symptom severity (n = 804) was reduced by 0.26 points (95% CI −0.48 to −0.03). The odds of illness deterioration (n = 2024) was 0.24 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.53) times lower from treatment with amoxicillin when both a bacterial and a viral pathogen were isolated (combined infection; n = 198). CONCLUSIONS: Amoxicillin may reduce the risk of illness deterioration in patients with a combined bacterial and viral infection. We found no clinically meaningful benefit from amoxicillin treatment in other subgroups.","Bruyndonckx, R.; Stuart, B.; Little, P.; Hens, N.; Ieven, M.; Butler, C.C.; Verheij, T.; Goossens, H.; Coenen, S.",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X17306262; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2017.10.032; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X17306262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29108950/,352

688578,Neuropsychological Pattern in a Series of Post-Acute COVID-19 Patients in a Rehabilitation Unit: Retrospective Analysis and Correlation with Functional Outcomes,2021-05-31,"Mobile electrocardiogram (mECG) devices are being used increasingly, supplying recordings to providers and providing automatic rhythm interpretation. Given the intermittent nature of certain cardiac arrhythmias, mECGs allow instant access to a recording device. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to limit in-person patient interactions and avoid overwhelming emergency and inpatient services would add value. Our goal was to evaluate whether a mECG device would reduce healthcare utilization overall, particularly those of urgent nature. We identified a cohort of KardiaMobile (AliveCor, USA) mECG users and compared their healthcare utilization 1 year prior to obtaining the device and 1 year after. One hundred and twenty-eight patients were studied (mean age 64, 47% female). Mean duration of follow-up pre-intervention was 9.8 months. One hundred and twenty-three of 128 individuals completed post-intervention follow-up. Patients were less likely to have cardiac monitors ordered (30 vs 6; p <0.01), outpatient office visits (525 vs 382; p <0.01), cardiac-specific ED visits (51 vs 30; p <0.01), arrhythmia related ED visits (45 vs 20; p <0.01), and unplanned arrhythmia admissions (34 vs 11; p <0.01) in the year after obtaining a KardiaMobile device compared to the year prior to obtaining the device. Mobile technology is available for heart rhythm monitoring and can give feedback to the user. This study showed a reduction of in-person, healthcare utilization with mECG device use. In conclusion, this strategy would be expected to decrease the risk of exposure to patients and providers and would avoid overwhelming emergency and inpatient services.","Johnson, Drew M; Junarta, Joey; Gerace, Christopher; Frisch, Daniel R",The American journal of cardiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34229856/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2021.05.027,352
690432,Perceived Threat of COVID-19 Contagion and Frontline Paramedics’ Agonistic Behaviour: Employing a Stressor–Strain–Outcome Perspective,2020-07-15,"The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines brings hope for successful pandemic mitigation and getting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control. The vaccines authorized in Europe displayed a good safety profile in the clinical trials. However, during their post-authorization use, unusual thrombotic events associated with thrombocytopenia have rarely been reported for vector vaccines. This led to the temporary suspension of the AZD1222 vaccine (Oxford/AstraZeneca) in various European countries and the Ad26.COV2 vaccine (Janssen/Johnson&Johnson) in the United States, with regulatory bodies launching investigations into potential causal associations. The thromboembolic reactions were also rarely reported after mRNA vaccines. The exact cause of these adverse effects remains to be elucidated. The present paper outlines the hypotheses on the mechanisms behind the very rare thrombotic thrombocytopenia reported after the COVID-19 vaccination, along with currently existing evidence and future research prospects. The following are discussed: (i) the role of antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4), (ii) the direct interaction between adenoviral vector and platelets, (iii) the cross-reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with PF4, (iv) cross-reactivity of anti-adenovirus antibodies and PF4, (v) interaction between spike protein and platelets, (vi) the platelet expression of spike protein and subsequent immune response, and (vii) the platelet expression of other adenoviral proteins and subsequent reactions. It is also plausible that thrombotic thrombocytopenia after the COVID-19 vaccine is multifactorial. The elucidation of the causes of these adverse events is pivotal in taking precautionary measures and managing vaccine hesitancy. It needs to be stressed, however, that the reported cases are currently sporadic and that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines vastly outweigh their potential risks.","Rzymski, Piotr; Perek, Bartłomiej; Flisiak, Robert",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071883/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060559,352
