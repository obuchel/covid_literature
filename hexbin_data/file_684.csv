16975,"Association of Prehospital Oxygen Saturation to Inspired Oxygen Ratio With 1-, 2-, and 7-Day Mortality",2021-04-13,"OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the barriers and facilitators to the adoption of point-of-care tests (POCTs). DESIGN: Qualitative study incorporating a constant comparative analysis of stakeholder responses to a series of interviews undertaken to design the Point-of-Care Key Evidence Tool. SETTING: The study was conducted in relation to POCTs used in all aspects of healthcare. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-three stakeholders were interviewed including clinicians (incorporating laboratory staff and members of trust POCT committees), commissioners, industry, regulators and patients. RESULTS: Thematic analysis highlighted 32 barriers in six themes and 28 facilitators in eight themes to the adoption of POCTs. Six themes were common to both barriers and facilitators (clinical, cultural, evidence, design and quality assurance, financial and organisational) and two themes contained facilitators alone (patient factors and other (non-financial) resource use). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study demonstrate the complex motivations of stakeholders in the adoption of POCT. Most themes were common to both barriers and facilitators suggesting that good device design, stakeholder engagement and appropriate evidence provision can increase the likelihood of a POCT device adoption. However, it is important to realise that while the majority of identified barriers may be perceived or mitigated some may be absolute and if identified early in device development further investment should be carefully considered.","Huddy, Jeremy R; Ni, Melody Zhifang; Barlow, James; Hanna, George B",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8051412/,684
18573,Availability of Cost-effectiveness Studies for Drugs With High Medicare Part D Expenditures,2021-06-18,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO)-defined radiological pneumonia is a preferred endpoint in pneumococcal vaccine efficacy and effectiveness studies in children. Automating the WHO methodology may support more widespread application of this endpoint. METHODS: We trained a deep learning model to classify pneumonia CXRs in children using the World Health Organization (WHO)’s standardized methodology. The model was pretrained on CheXpert, a dataset containing 224,316 adult CXRs, and fine-tuned on PERCH, a pediatric dataset containing 4,172 CXRs. The model was then tested on two pediatric CXR datasets released by WHO. We also compared the model’s performance to that of radiologists and pediatricians. RESULTS: The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for primary endpoint pneumonia (PEP) across 10-fold validation of PERCH images was 0.928; average AUC after testing on WHO images was 0.977. The model’s classification performance was better on test images with high inter-observer agreement; however, the model still outperformed human assessments in AUC and precision-recall spaces on low agreement images. CONCLUSION: A deep learning model can classify pneumonia CXR images in children at a performance comparable to human readers. Our method lays a strong foundation for the potential inclusion of computer-aided readings of pediatric CXRs in vaccine trials and epidemiology studies.","Chen, Yiyun; Roberts, Craig S.; Ou, Wanmei; Petigara, Tanaz; Goldmacher, Gregory V.; Fancourt, Nicholas; Knoll, Maria Deloria",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8216551/,684

77662,Coronavirus Disease 2019-An Impetus for Resident Education Reform?,2020-07-09,"Background and Purpose- The brush sign (BS) is an abnormally accentuated signal drop of the subependymal and deep medullary veins in paramagnetic-sensitive magnetic resonance sequences, previously described in acute ischemic stroke. We aimed to describe the BS in patients with thrombosis of the cerebral veins and sinuses and explore its association with clinical severity, thrombosis extent, parenchymal brain lesion, and clinical prognosis. Methods- We assessed consecutive adult patients admitted to 2 university hospitals with diagnosis of acute thrombosis of the cerebral veins and sinuses and imaging assessment with magnetic resonance imaging, including paramagnetic-sensitive sequences. Demographics, imaging findings, clinical presentation, and functional outcome at 3 months were analyzed according to the presence of BS. Results- In 118 patients included, BS was observed in gradient-echo T2*weighted (T2*WI) in 16% and susceptibility-weighted imaging in 13% of cases. All patients with BS had thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus, straight sinus, or deep venous system. BS was associated with ipsilateral parenchymal lesion (odds ratio, 6.4; 95% CI, 1.9-21.1; P=0.002) and higher thrombus load (median [interquartile range] 5 [4-6] versus 2 [2-4]); P<0.0001). BS was also associated with focal neurological deficits (OR 4.2; 95%CI, 1.4-12.7, P=0.01). The functional outcome at 3 months was not significantly different in patients with BS. Conclusions- BS in T2*WI and susceptibility-weighted imaging was observed in approximately one in 7 patients with acute thrombosis of the cerebral veins and sinuses. BS was significantly associated with ipsilateral parenchymal brain lesion, extent of thrombosis, and manifestation with focal neurological deficits. This suggests that BS can represent a marker of severity in thrombosis of the cerebral veins and sinuses.","Aguiar de Sousa, Diana; Lucas Neto, Lia; Jung, Simon; Penas, Sara; Panos, Leonidas; Heldner, Mirjam R; Fischer, Urs; Arnold, Marcel; Canhão, Patrícia; El-Koussy, Marwan; Ferro, José M; Hakim, Arsany",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.119.025342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035899/,684

METHODS search in Medline, Embase, Cinahl, The Cochrane Library, Trip databases. Google Scholar, Rayyan and medRxiv were also consulted for complementary results. No filters related to date, language or publication status were applied. Titles and abstracts were screened, and later, full texts were evaluated. RESULTS three studies were included: a randomized cluster clinical trial and two systematic reviews. The clinical trial indicates a potential benefit of medical masks to control the source of clinical respiratory disease infection. In one of the systematic reviews, it was not possible to establish a conclusive relationship between the use of the mask and protection against respiratory infection. Finally, another systematic review indicated that masks are effective in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses. CONCLUSION Evidence points to the potential benefit of standard non-woven face masks. For the current pandemic scenario of COVID-19, education on the appropriate use of masks associated with individual protection measures is recommended.","Camargo, Maria Cristina de; Martinez-Silveira, Martha Sílvia; Lima, Adeânio Almeida; Bastos, Bruno Pires; Santos, Diana Lima Dos; Mota, Sara Emanuela de Carvalho; Silva, Roberta Borges; Toledo, Isabela Porto de",Ciencia & saude coletiva,https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232020259.13622020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32876275/,684

DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES Research papers published between January 1971 - February 2019 were identified from the following databases: Embase, Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL, ERIC, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Google Scholar. REVIEW METHODS We followed the procedures recommended by the Editorial Board of the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group. We included peer-reviewed articles with a quantitative research design, examining interventions aimed at improving mental health of student and novice nurses and their effect on dropout-related outcomes. The large variation in studies prohibited statistical pooling and a synthesis without meta-analysis of studies was performed. RESULTS We identified 21 studies with three areas of focus: managing stress or stressors (N=4); facilitating the transition to nursing practice (N=14); and a combined approach (N=3). Five studies showed a statistically significant effect on dropout-related outcomes. The overall risk of bias was high. CONCLUSION A wide range of interventions are available, but the evidence for their effectiveness is limited. There is a need for high-quality studies in this field, preferably with a randomised controlled design.","Bakker, Ellen J M; Kox, Jos H A M; Boot, Cécile R L; Francke, Anneke L; Van Der Beek, Allard J; Roelofs, Pepijn D D M",Journal of advanced nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32538480/,684

127218,Genodermatoses with itch as a prominent feature.,2020-09-25,"OVERVIEW The availability of blood components has increased the number of indications for transfusing cats, and fresh whole blood is readily accessible to clinicians because it can be taken from in-house donor cats or 'volunteer' feline blood donors. A certain amount of risk remains to the recipient cat, as immediate or delayed adverse reactions can occur during or after transfusion, related to immunemediated mechanisms. This article, however, focuses on adverse events caused by infectious agents, which may originate either from contamination of blood following incorrect collection, storage or transfusion, or from transfusion of contaminated blood obtained from an infected donor. PREVENTION OF BLOOD CONTAMINATION In cats, blood cannot be collected through a closed system and, therefore, collection of donor blood requires a multi-step manipulation of syringes and other devices. It is crucial that each step of the procedure is performed under the strictest aseptic conditions and that bacterial contamination of blood bags is prevented, as bacterial endotoxins can cause an immediate febrile reaction or even fatal shock in the recipient cat. PREVENTION OF DISEASE TRANSMISSION With a view to preventing transmission of blood-borne infectious diseases, the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine has adopted basic criteria for selecting pathogens to be tested for in donor pets. The worldwide core screening panel for donor cats includes feline leukaemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, Bartonella species and feline haemoplasma. The list should be adapted to the local epidemiological situation concerning other vector-borne feline infections. The most practical, rapid and inexpensive measure to reduce transfusion risk is to check the risk profile of donor cats on the basis of a written questionnaire. Blood transfusion can never, however, be considered entirely safe.","Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Hartmann, Katrin; Addie, Diane D; Lutz, Hans; Gruffydd-Jones, Tim; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Egberink, Herman; Frymus, Tadeusz; Horzinek, Marian C; Hosie, Margaret J; Lloret, Albert; Marsilio, Fulvio; Radford, Alan D; Thiry, Etienne; Truyen, Uwe; Möstl, Karin",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x15588449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26101310/,684

This study thus analyzed whether the loop technique could preserve mitral leaflet mobility on trans-thoracic echocardiography. METHODSANDRESULTS Among 367 concomitant patients who underwent mitral valve repair at Keio University Hospital between January 2007 and December 2014, 304 patients had a prolapse of the posterior leaflet. Of these, 84 cases assessed on echocardiography were retrospectively analyzed for this study. These patients were divided into 4 groups based on the procedure used: (1) group L1 (n=28), loop technique alone; (2) group L2 (n=14), loop technique with resection and suture; (3) group L3 (n=33), loop technique with plication of indentation; and (4) group R (n=9), resection and suture alone. The mean postoperative mobile posterior mitral leaflet (PML) angles in groups L1 and L2 (39.3±16.0°, 37.3±16.0°) were significantly larger than those in groups L3 and R (18.8±15.7°, 15.3±15.7°), respectively (P<0.01). Ring size, age, and mobile PML angle had a statistically significant correlation with the postoperative mean mitral valve pressure gradient (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The loop technique preserved PML mobility and enabled implantation of a larger ring, resulting in a reduced mean mitral valve pressure gradient.

141979,Erratum regarding missing Declaration of Competing Interest statements in previously published articles.,2020-12-08,"Genes of HLA system (Human Leukocyte Antigen) play an essential role in the normal functioning of the immune system. There are three classes of genes: I, II, and III. The function of HLA molecules class I is to present antigens of peptides from the cytoplasm to T-lymphocytes on the cell surface, and class II - to present antigens of peptides from the extracellular space. In the classical view, the pathological activation of the immune system in patients with a genetic predisposition can result in the development of autoimmune diseases. However, the influence of this system on the development of non-autoimmune diseases, their severity and prognosis, has been recently considered. Besides, HLA molecules provide a presentation of various infectious agents. In this connection, the loci of the main histocompatibility complex can be considered candidates for determining the genetic predisposition to infectious diseases themselves and their course. This review hypothesizes that specific variants of HLA genes may cause the formation of a «cytokine storm» in patients with COVID-19. Identification of a group of patients with particular genetic variations that cause violation of immune tolerance and hyperresponse in the setting of viral infection will help to optimize the algorithm for disease prevention and treatment of such patients and, as a result, to reduce the severity of the epidemiological situation.","Troshina, Ekaterina A; Yukina, Marina Yu; Nuralieva, Nurana F; Mokrysheva, Natalia G",Problemy endokrinologii,https://doi.org/10.14341/probl12470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33351354/,684

Most studies on adult HLH have evaluated prognostic factors for overall survival; factors predicting early mortality have not been sufficiently investigated. METHODS This was a collaborative study between Henry Ford Hospital and Barnes-Jewish Hospital. We identified all adult HLH patients with at least 2 ferritin levels within 30 days from admission. RESULTS One-hundred twenty-four patients were identified. There were 77 males and 47 females; the median age at diagnosis was 48 years. Multivariate analysis showed that age (OR = 11.41; 95% CI:2.71-48.04; P = .001), hepatomegaly (OR = 15.68; 95% CI:3.24-75.96; P = .001), hyponatremia (OR = 5.94; 95% CI:1.76-20.1; P = .004), hypoalbuminemia (OR = 7.47; 95% CI:2.08-26.85; P = .002), and increasing ferritin levels (OR = 19.46; 95% CI:4.69-80.71; P < .001) were significant predictors of 30-day mortality. Patients with declining ferritin by more than 35% from the ferritin peak were more likely to survive the first 30 days of admission (OR = 4.33; 95% CI:1.04-18.1; P = .033). By risk stratifying our cohort, we identified changes in ferritin levels to be the most significant prognostic factor of 30-day mortality among other risk factors. Further investigating the prognostic utility of ferritin showed that increasing ferritin during the 1st week of admission (data available for 44 patients) was the only significant predictor of 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting changes in ferritin to be a predictor for early death in adult HLH. Changes in ferritin might be a useful indicator of adult HLH disease activity and early prognosis.","Abou Shaar, Rand; Eby, Charles S; van Dorp, Suzanne; de Witte, Theo; Otrock, Zaher K",International journal of laboratory hematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijlh.13489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33595184/,684

For several viruses, a dependence on cholesterol for virus entry and/or morphogenesis has been shown. Using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that infection of cells by canine distemper virus (CDV) was not impaired after cellular cholesterol had been depleted by the drug methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. This effect was independent of the multiplicity of infection and the cellular receptor used for infection. However, cholesterol depletion of the viral envelope significantly reduced CDV infectivity. Replenishment by addition of exogenous cholesterol restored infectivity up to 80%. Thus, we conclude that CDV entry is dependent on cholesterol in the viral envelope. Furthermore, reduced syncytium formation was observed when the cells were cholesterol depleted during the course of the infection. This may be related to the observation that CDV envelope proteins H and F partitioned into cellular detergent-resistant membranes. Therefore, a role for lipid rafts during virus assembly and release as well is suggested.","Imhoff, Heidi; von Messling, Veronika; Herrler, Georg; Haas, Ludwig",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17267508/,684

We aimed to clarify the characteristics and clinical significance of peripheral lymphocyte subset alteration in COVID-19. METHODS: The levels of peripheral lymphocyte subsets were measured by flow cytometry in 60 hospitalized COVID-19 patients before and after treatment, and their association with clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy was analyzed. RESULTS: Total lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells decreased in COVID-19 patients, and severe cases had a lower level than mild cases. The subsets showed a significant association with inflammatory status in COVID-19, especially CD8+ T cells and CD4+/CD8+ ratio. After treatment, 37 patients (67%) showed clinical response, with an increase in CD8+ T cells and B cells. No significant change in any subset was detected in nonresponsive cases. In multivariate analysis, posttreatment decrease in CD8+ T cells and B cells and increase in CD4+/CD8+ ratio were indicated as independent predictors of poor efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral lymphocyte subset alteration was associated with clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy of COVID-19.

METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase with the keywords: inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, novel coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2. We included studies reporting the frequency of COVID-19 infection and outcomes (hospitalisation, need for intensive care unit care and mortality) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We estimated the pooled incidence of COVID-19 in inflammatory bowel disease and comparative risk vis-a-vis the general population. We also estimated the pooled frequency of outcomes and compared them in patients who received and did not receive drugs for inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were included. The pooled incidence rate of COVID-19 per 1000 patients of inflammatory bowel disease and the general population were 4.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44-11.17) and 6.59 (3.25-13.35), respectively, with no increase in relative risk (0.47, 0.18-1.26) in inflammatory bowel disease. The relative risk of the acquisition of COVID-19 was not different between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (1.03, 0.62-1.71). The pooled proportion of COVID-19-positive inflammatory bowel disease patients requiring hospitalisation and intensive care unit care was 27.29% and 5.33% while pooled mortality was 4.27%. The risk of adverse outcomes was higher in ulcerative colitis compared to Crohn's disease. The relative risks of hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission and mortality were lower for patients on biological agents (0.34, 0.19-0.61; 0.49, 0.33-0.72 and 0.22, 0.13-0.38, respectively) but higher with steroids (1.99, 1.64-2.40; 3.41, 2.28-5.11 and 2.70, 1.61-4.55) or 5-aminosalicylate (1.59, 1.39-1.82; 2.38, 1.26-4.48 and 2.62, 1.67-4.11) use.

668138,Erratum regarding missing Declaration of Competing Interest statements in previously published articles,2020-12-06,"The calcium-dependent lectins DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR (collectively termed DC-SIGN/R) bind to high-mannose carbohydrates on a variety of viruses. In contrast, the related lectin LSECtin does not recognize mannose-rich glycans and interacts with a more restricted spectrum of viruses. Here, we analyzed whether these lectins differ in their mode of ligand engagement. LSECtin and DC-SIGNR, which we found to be co-expressed by liver, lymph node and bone marrow sinusoidal endothelial cells, bound to soluble Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) with comparable affinities. Similarly, LSECtin, DC-SIGN and the Langerhans cell-specific lectin Langerin readily bound to soluble human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) GP. However, only DC-SIGN captured HIV-1 particles, indicating that binding to soluble GP is not necessarily predictive of binding to virion-associated GP. Capture of EBOV-GP by LSECtin triggered ligand internalization, suggesting that LSECtin like DC-SIGN might function as an antigen uptake receptor. However, the intracellular fate of lectin–ligand complexes might differ. Thus, exposure to low-pH medium, which mimics the acidic luminal environment in endosomes/lysosomes, released ligand bound to DC-SIGN/R but had no effect on LSECtin interactions with ligand. Our results reveal important differences between pathogen capture by DC-SIGN/R and LSECtin and hint towards different biological functions of these lectins.","Gramberg, Thomas; Soilleux, Elizabeth; Fisch, Tanja; Lalor, Patricia F.; Hofmann, Heike; Wheeldon, Sophie; Cotterill, Andrew; Wegele, Anja; Winkler, Thomas; Adams, David H.; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682207007544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18083206/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682207007544,684

The COVID Radar smartphone app, active in the Netherlands, allows users to self-report symptoms, social distancing behaviors, and COVID-19 status daily. The objective of this study is to describe the validation of the COVID Radar. METHODS: COVID Radar users are asked to complete a daily questionnaire consisting of 20 questions assessing their symptoms, social distancing behavior, and COVID-19 status. We describe the internal and external validation of symptoms, behavior, and both user-reported COVID-19 status and state-reported COVID-19 case numbers. RESULTS: Since April 2nd, 2020, over 6 million observations from over 250,000 users have been collected using the COVID Radar app. Almost 2,000 users reported having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Amongst users testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the proportion of observations reporting symptoms was higher than that of the cohort as a whole in the week prior to a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Likewise, users who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 showed above average risk social-distancing behavior. Per-capita user-reported SARS-CoV-2 positive tests closely matched government-reported per-capita case counts in provinces with high user engagement. DISCUSSION: The COVID Radar app allows voluntarily self-reporting of COVID-19 related symptoms and social distancing behaviors. Symptoms and risk behavior increase prior to a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and user-reported case counts match closely with nationally-reported case counts in regions with high user engagement. These results suggest the COVID Radar may be a valid instrument for future surveillance and potential predictive analytics to identify emerging hotspots.","van Dijk, Willian J.; Saadah, Nicholas H.; Numans, Mattijs E.; Aardoom, Jiska J.; Bonten, Tobias N.; Brandjes, Menno; Brust, Michelle; le Cessie, Saskia; Chavannes, Niels H.; Middelburg, Rutger A.; Rosendaal, Frits; Visser, Leo G.; Kiefte-de Jong, Jessica",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191828/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253566,684
