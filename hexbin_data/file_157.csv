1405,1405,1405,Glial response during cuprizone-induced de- and remyelination in the CNS: lessons learned,15.613586,4.906837,2014-03-13,"Although astrogliosis and microglia activation are characteristic features of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other central nervous system (CNS) lesions the exact functions of these events are not fully understood. Animal models help to understand the complex interplay between the different cell types of the CNS and uncover general mechanisms of damage and repair of myelin sheaths. The so called cuprizone model is a toxic model of demyelination in the CNS white and gray matter, which lacks an autoimmune component. Cuprizone induces apoptosis of mature oligodendrocytes that leads to a robust demyelination and profound activation of both astrocytes and microglia with regional heterogeneity between different white and gray matter regions. Although not suitable to study autoimmune mediated demyelination, this model is extremely helpful to elucidate basic cellular and molecular mechanisms during de- and particularly remyelination independently of interactions with peripheral immune cells. Phagocytosis and removal of damaged myelin seems to be one of the major roles of microglia in this model and it is well known that removal of myelin debris is a prerequisite of successful remyelination. Furthermore, microglia provide several signals that support remyelination. The role of astrocytes during de- and remyelination is not well defined. Both supportive and destructive functions have been suggested. Using the cuprizone model we could demonstrate that there is an important crosstalk between astrocytes and microglia. In this review we focus on the role of glial reactions and interaction in the cuprizone model. Advantages and limitations of as well as its potential therapeutic relevance for the human disease MS are critically discussed in comparison to other animal models.","Gudi, Viktoria; Gingele, Stefan; Skripuletz, Thomas; Stangel, Martin",Front Cell Neurosci,157,8

11307,11307,11307,Neonatal transport in California: findings from a qualitative investigation,15.701343,5.144547,2019-07-03,"Geriatric trauma patients (GTP) (age ≥ 65 years) with blunt splenic injury (BSI) have up to a 6% failure rate of non-operative management (NOM). GTPs failing NOM have a similar mortality rate compared to GTPs managed successfully with NOM. However, it is unclear if this remains true in octogenarians (aged 80–89 years). We hypothesized that the failure rate for NOM in octogenarians would be similar to their younger geriatric cohort, patients aged 65–79 years; however risk of mortality in octogenarians who fail NOM would be higher than that of octogenarians managed successfully with NOM. The Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010–2016) was queried for patients with BSI. Those undergoing splenectomy within 6 h were excluded to select for patients undergoing NOM. Patients aged 65–79 years (young GTPs) were compared to octogenarians. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine the risk for failed NOM and mortality. From 43,041 BSI patients undergoing NOM, 3660 (8.5%) were aged 65–79 years and 1236 (2.9%) were octogenarians. Both groups had a similar median Injury Severity Score (ISS) (p = 0.10) and failure rate of NOM (6.6% young GTPs vs. 6.8% octogenarians p = 0.82). From those failing NOM, octogenarians had similar units of blood products transfused (p > 0.05) and a higher mortality rate (40.5% vs. 18.2%, p < 0.001), compared to young GTPs. Independent risk factors for failing NOM in octogenarians included ≥ 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) (p = 0.039) within 24 h of admission. Octogenarians who failed NOM had a higher mortality rate compared to octogenarians managed successfully with NOM (40.5% vs 23.6% p = 0.001), which persisted in a multivariable logistic regression analysis (OR 2.25, CI 1.37–3.70, p < 0.001). Late failure of NOM ≥ 24 h (vs. early failure) was not associated with increased risk of mortality (p = 0.88), but ≥ 1 unit of PRBC transfused had higher risk (OR 1.88, CI 1.20–2.95, p = 0.006). Compared to young GTPs with BSI, octogenarians have a similar rate of failed NOM. Octogenarians with BSI who fail NOM have over a twofold higher risk of mortality compared to those managed successfully with NOM. PRBC transfusion increases risk for mortality. Therefore, clinicians should consider failure of NOM earlier in the octogenarian population to mitigate the risk of increased mortality.","Bashir, Rame; Grigorian, Areg; Lekawa, Michael; Joe, Victor; Schubl, Sebastian D.; Chin, Theresa L.; Kong, Allen; Nahmias, Jeffry",Updates Surg,157,1

The lens can be a source of ocular inflammation when the capsule is broken or when lens proteins leak out through an intact capsule. These uveitides are termed lens-induced uveitis (LIU) and are often associated with advanced cataracts. Cataracts are part of the normal aging process, and in today’s world, cataract surgery is a safe and affordable means of vision restoration in the developed world. In patients with neglected cataracts and in the developing world where cataract surgery rates are lower, LIU rates are higher together with the associated complications. In this literature review, we intend to equip the armamentarium of the practicing ophthalmologist with an updated knowledge on the demographic features, clinical characteristics, treatment options, and outcomes of LIU. This is to highlight the need for timely management of cataracts before the development of advanced cataracts and LIU.","Nche, Eleanor Ngwe; Amer, Radgonde",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,157,1

During the past three decades, use of BAL specimens has stimulated immunologic and cellular research of pulmonary diseases, which has provided significant insight into local host immunity, inflammation, fibrogenesis, asthma mechanisms, and infections. From this research new methods of antifibrotic therapy of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, for example, have followed. Moreover, BAL applications have greatly enhanced professional interest in the field of pulmonary medicine. This review attempts to analyze the history and impact of BAL, appraise its current status, and assess its future usefulness. Understanding the immunopathogenesis of many lung diseases is predicated on obtaining in situ specimens from affected lung tissue and airways. BAL provides a direct sample that can be compared with an endobronchial or transbronchial biopsy tissue specimen and with cellular and immunologic components in the vascular circulation. Thus, the recovery of BAL fluid and its components involved directly with a disease process or continguous with interstitial tissue permits a much more detailed assessment of new cellular mediators and cytokines participating in the pathologic process. Furthermore, subjecting BAL cells to microarrays of DNA to discern what genes are activated will be one step closer to identifying intracellular processes involved or deranged. Identification of causative factors may solve questions of causation, so that preventive strategies or definitive therapy can be used.","Reynolds, H. Y.",Lung,157,1

Here, we reveal that endo‐lysosomes act as platforms for a new phagocytic signalling pathway in which FcγR activation recruits the second messenger NAADP and thereby promotes the opening of Ca(2+)‐permeable two‐pore channels (TPCs). Remarkably, phagocytosis is driven by these local endo‐lysosomal Ca(2+) nanodomains rather than global cytoplasmic or ER Ca(2+) signals. Motile endolysosomes contact nascent phagosomes to promote phagocytosis, whereas endo‐lysosome immobilization prevents it. We show that TPC‐released Ca(2+) rapidly activates calcineurin, which in turn dephosphorylates and activates the GTPase dynamin‐2. Finally, we find that different endo‐lysosomal Ca(2+) channels play diverse roles, with TPCs providing a universal phagocytic signal for a wide range of particles and TRPML1 being only required for phagocytosis of large targets.","Davis, Lianne C; Morgan, Anthony J; Galione, Antony",EMBO J,157,16

METHODS: We included all airway-related civil legal cases involving specialist anesthesiologists that closed from 2007 to 2016. The following variables were abstracted by CMPA medical analysts: clinical context, peer expert opinions of contributing factors, and patient and legal outcomes. RESULTS: We found 46 of the 406 (11%) closed cases involving anesthesiologists to be airway-related. Twenty-six cases (57%) involved elective surgery and 31 patients (67%) were categorized as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status III. Twenty-five cases (54%) occurred outside the operating room (e.g., postanesthesia care unit, intensive care unit, or other satellite locations). In 19 (42%) cases, there was at least one predictor of a difficult airway. Peer experts identified judgement failures in 30 cases (65%), most commonly inadequate airway evaluation. In 30 cases (65%), the patient died or had a permanent brain injury. The medicolegal outcome favoured the patient in 27 (59%) cases, with a median [interquartile range] payment of 422,845 [257,637-935,673] CAD. CONCLUSIONS: Severe patient harm is common when airway management is the focus of a CMPA medicolegal complaint involving anesthesiologists. Patients were otherwise typically low risk cases presenting for elective surgery. Failure to assess or to change management based on the airway exam or encountered difficulty were the most common errors. Our findings support the continued need for adoption, adherence, and practice of guidelines for anticipated and unanticipated difficult airway management for every patient encounter.","Crosby, Edward T.; Duggan, Laura V.; Finestone, Patricia J.; Liu, Richard; De Gorter, Ria; Calder, Lisa A.",Can J Anaesth,157,1

Recently, we reported a highly specific interaction between IFN-β and S100P lowering IFN-β cytotoxicity to cancer cells (Int J Biol Macromol. 2020; 143: 633–639). S100P is a member of large family of multifunctional Ca(2+)-binding proteins with cytokine-like activities. To probe selectivity of IFN-β—S100 interaction with respect to S100 proteins, we used surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, chemical crosslinking, and crystal violet assay. Among the thirteen S100 proteins studied S100A1, S100A4, and S100A6 proteins exhibit strictly Ca(2+)-dependent binding to IFN-β with equilibrium dissociation constants, K(d), of 0.04–1.5 µM for their Ca(2+)-bound homodimeric forms. Calcium depletion abolishes the S100—IFN-β interactions. Monomerization of S100A1/A4/A6 decreases K(d) values down to 0.11–1.0 nM. Interferon-α is unable of binding to the S100 proteins studied. S100A1/A4 proteins inhibit IFN-β-induced suppression of MCF-7 cells viability. The revealed direct influence of specific S100 proteins on IFN-β activity uncovers a novel regulatory role of particular S100 proteins, and opens up novel approaches to enhancement of therapeutic efficacy of IFN-β.","Kazakov, Alexey S.; Sofin, Alexander D.; Avkhacheva, Nadezhda V.; Denesyuk, Alexander I.; Deryusheva, Evgenia I.; Rastrygina, Victoria A.; Sokolov, Andrey S.; Permyakova, Maria E.; Litus, Ekaterina A.; Uversky, Vladimir N.; Permyakov, Eugene A.; Permyakov, Sergei E.",Int J Mol Sci,157,1

However, this progress is threatened by the wide-scale selection of insecticide-resistant malaria vectors. It is, therefore, important to accelerate the generation of evidence for new classes of LLINs. METHODS: This protocol presents a three-arm superiority, single-blinded, cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of 2 novel dual-active ingredient LLINs on epidemiological and entomological outcomes in Benin, a malaria-endemic area with highly pyrethroid-resistant vector populations. The study arms consist of (i) Royal Guard® LLIN, a net combining a pyrethroid (alpha-cypermethrin) plus an insect growth regulator (pyriproxyfen), which in the adult female is known to disrupt reproduction and egg fertility; (ii) Interceptor G2® LLIN, a net incorporating two adulticides (alpha-cypermethrin and chlorfenapyr) with different modes of action; and (iii) the control arm, Interceptor® LLIN, a pyrethroid (alpha-cypermethrin) only LLIN. In all arms, one net for every 2 people will be distributed to each household. Sixty clusters were identified and randomised 1:1:1 to each study arm. The primary outcome is malaria case incidence measured over 24 months through active case detection in a cohort of 25 children aged 6 months to 10 years, randomly selected from each cluster. Secondary outcomes include 1) malaria infection prevalence (all ages) and prevalence of moderate to severe anaemia in children under 5 years old, measured at 6 and 18 months post-intervention; 2) entomological indices measured every 3 months using human landing catches over 24 months. Insecticide resistance intensity will also be monitored over the study period. DISCUSSION: This study is the second cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of these next-generation LLINs to control malaria transmitted by insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. The results of this study will form part of the WHO evidence-based review to support potential public health recommendations of these nets and shape malaria control strategies of sub-Saharan Africa for the next decade.

Genetic studies have revealed necessary signaling molecules, but it remains unclear how cellular dynamics generate elongating, bending, and coiling of the cochlear duct. Here, we show that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation waves control collective cell migration during the murine cochlear duct development using deep tissue live-cell imaging, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based quantitation, and mathematical modeling. Long-term FRET imaging reveals that helical ERK activation propagates from the apex duct tip concomitant with the reverse multicellular flow on the lateral side of the developing cochlear duct, resulting in advection-based duct elongation. Moreover, model simulations, together with experiments, explain that the oscillatory wave trains of ERK activity and the cell flow are generated by mechanochemical feedback. Our findings propose a regulatory mechanism to coordinate the multicellular behaviors underlying the duct elongation during development.","Ishii, Mamoru; Tateya, Tomoko; Matsuda, Michiyuki; Hirashima, Tsuyoshi",,157,13

We pooled 10 034 person-visit data from 3 cohort studies in Bangladesh that had measured 24-hour urine sodium (m-24hUNa), potassium, creatinine excretion, and BP. We used m-24hUNa, potassium, and creatinine where necessary, rather than spot urine values in the formulas. Bland-Altman plots were used to determine the bias associated with formula-estimated sodium relative to m-24hUNa. We compared the sodium excretion and BP relationships from m-24hUNa versus formula-estimated sodium excretions, using restricted cubic spline plots for adjusted multilevel linear models. All formulas overestimated 24-hour sodium at lower levels but underestimated 24-hour sodium at higher levels. There was a linear relationship between m-24hUNa excretion and systolic BP, while estimated sodium excretion from all 3 formulas had a J-shaped relationship with systolic BP. The relationships between urine sodium excretion and diastolic BP were more complex but were also altered by using formulas. All formulas had associations with BP when a sex-specific constant sodium concentration was inserted in place of measured sodium. Since we used the m-24hUNa, potassium, and creatinine concentrations in formulas, the J-shaped relationships are due to intrinsic problems in the formulas, not due to spot urine sampling. Formula-estimated 24-hour urine sodium excretion should not be used to examine the relationship between sodium excretion and BP since they alter the real associations.","Naser, Abu Mohd; He, Feng J.; Rahman, Mahbubur; Campbell, Norm R.C.",Hypertension,157,1

Therefore, a specific rehabilitation approach is necessary to manage the PFP-related needs of these runners within their means and reach. OBJECTIVE: To develop a community-based rehabilitation (CBR) implementation framework for PFP amongst runners in under-resourced communities. METHOD: Our study used the Delphi technique to develop an appropriate rehabilitation implementation framework for PFP in community-based settings. Sport medicine experts, involved in the treatment and rehabilitation of PFP, were recruited to participate. The Delphi process consisted of three rounds to attain consensus amongst the experts on the components and elements that could be contained in a rehabilitation implementation framework for the management of PFP. Experts rated the framework items using a five-point Likert scale. RESULTS: A total of 19 experts participated in our study: 10 were females and 9 were males of whom 13 were aged between 36 and 55 years. Most were local experts (15) with 11–20 years of clinical experience. Four core rehabilitation implementation items were identified through the Delphi process. These were: (1) the establishment of transdisciplinary rehabilitation teams, (2) upskilling of available clinicians, their assistants and trainers, (3) implementation of a CBR programme at low-level or no-cost and (4) referral of cases to secondary or tertiary institutions for further management. CONCLUSION: Consensus was reached for a comprehensive CBR implementation framework aimed at addressing the specific needs of runners with PFP in under-resourced communities.

Methods By using grounded theory, we conducted semi-structured, open-ended telephone/skype interviews of emergency physicians and geriatric providers recruited from a purposeful sampling technique. The interviews were transcribed and reviewed by two investigators. The codes were generated and listed, and common concepts emerged. Lastly, the final codes were organized into concepts and themes with the aim to create a strong coding structure. Result The main lessons learned are: (1) understand the hospital’s existing local environment and resources, (2) utilize champions and interdisciplinary teams, (3) acknowledge that specific fall assessment tools and interventions vary widely between institutions, (4) engage in routine plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles to improve the quality of fall initiatives, and (5) operate under the principle that falls are a syndrome, which must be incorporated within the multifactorial medical needs of geriatric fall patients. Conclusion Based on the lessons learned from our ED fall implementation pioneers, implementing an effective geriatric fall protocol in an ED setting is complicated. Understanding a hospital’s resources, assigning champions, working as an interdisciplinary team, choosing proper fall assessment tools/interventions, and completing regular PDSA cycles are important lessons for ED programs planning to implement their own ED fall programs.","Thatphet, Phraewa; Kayarian, Fae B; Ouchi, Kei; Hogan, Teresita; Schumacher, John G; Kennedy, Maura; Liu, Shan W",,157,22

Although mumps is a vaccine-preventable disease, sporadic outbreaks have occurred worldwide, even in highly vaccinated populations. MuV not only causes systemic infection but also has a unique tropism to glandular tissues and the central nervous system. In general, tropism can be defined by multiple factors in the viral life cycle, including its entry, interaction with host factors, and host-cell immune responses. Although the underlying mechanisms of MuV tropism remain to be fully understood, recent studies on virus–host interactions have provided insights into viral pathogenesis. This review was aimed at summarizing the entry process of MuV by focusing on the glycan receptors, particularly the recently identified receptors with a trisaccharide core motif, and their interactions with the viral attachment proteins. Here, we describe the receptor structures, their distribution in the human body, and the recently identified host factors for MuV and analyze their relationship with MuV tropism.","Kubota, Marie; Hashiguchi, Takao",Viruses,157,1

At the conceptual heart of this model is presumption. Through its unique features of defeasibility, context sensitivity and much else besides, presumption, it was argued, is equipped to handle the full range of demands that uncertainty imposes on investigators during scientific inquiry. But presumption could not act alone in this endeavour. Several argument forms that have traditionally been characterized as fallacies became the vehicle through which presumption was given effect in a model of reasoning. These argument forms, it was contended, served to facilitate scientific inquiry when widespread uncertainty threatened to halt inquiry in its tracks. The purpose of this chapter will be to demonstrate in quite specific ways how certain of the fallacies achieved this facilitation in the case of scientific inquiry into BSE. The presumptive analyses of fallacies that have been advanced to date have certainly served to reveal rational features of the fallacies. These features have been largely obscured from view under traditionally dominant deductive and inductive conceptions of argument. To this extent, these analyses have helped to move the fallacies a bit further along the road towards full integration within cognitive rationality. But there are lingering suspicions amongst theorists that these argument forms, despite their demonstrated practical and other benefits in inquiry, may still not somehow fully warrant the type of rational legitimacy that routinely attends deductive and inductive modes of reasoning. In this chapter, I aim to dispel those suspicions once and for all by arguing in support of a clear role for the fallacies within cognitive rationality.","Cummings, Louise",Rethinking the BSE Crisis,157,17

The UN has won the Nobel Peace Prize a number of times: UN Middle East mediator (1950); UNHCR, the UN refugee agency (1954); UN Secretary-General (1961); UNICEF (1965); ILO, the UN labor agency (1969); UNHCR, the UN refugee agency (1981); UN peacekeeping (1988); and UN Secretary-General and the UN, jointly (2001). There are several bodies inside the UN that also have won the Nobel Peace Prize, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (2005) and Director Mohamed El-Baradei and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007). In addition, the prime minister of Canada, Lester Bowles Pearson, won Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the UN (1957). Médicins sans Frontières has won the Nobel Peace Prize once (1999)",,Global Lessons from the AIDS Pandemic,157,1

The identification at species level among the 18 established Bcc members is an essential tool for epidemiological studies and infection control policies. In the early 2000s the epidemiology of Burkholderia cepacia (Bcc) in Argentina was characterized by the occurrence of a B. contaminans outbreak that took place in major CF centres. This situation was quite different from other countries where B. cenocepacia and B. multivorans have been the most frequent Bcc infecting species in CF patients. Although B. contaminans outbreak was studied, little is known about the evolution of Bcc epidemiology during the last years. The aim of this study was to analyse Bcc infections in CF patients (pt) attending Hospital de Niños “R. Gutiérrez” in 3 different periods between 2004 and 2014. Incidence and distribution of Bcc species have been described. 2004–2005: Incidence 13.5% (22/163 pt). B. contaminans 55.6% (10/18), B. cepacia 16.7% (3/18), B. cenocepacia and B. seminalis 11.1% (2/18), B. multivorans 5.6% (1/18), 4 nonviable strains. 2007–2009: Incidence 6.6% (12/181 pt). B. contaminans 72.7% (8/11), B. cepacia 27.3% (3/11), 1 nonviable strain. 2012–2014: Incidence 5.4% (10/184 pt). B. contaminans 90% (9/10), B. cepacia 10% (1/10). CONCLUSION: B. contaminans remains the most frequent isolated species among the new cases of infection. Although incidence values have decreased, these results suggest the situation with B. contaminans hasn't been solved yet. More studies specially focusing on the transmission of these bacteria and the possible sources of infection are needed.","Ibarra, L.; Degrossi, J.; Vargas, L.

Within this context, successful results have been achieved based on the distributional hypothesis and/or the paradigmatic assumption. However, both strategies solely rely on the input words to predict the lexical semantic relation. In this paper, we make the hypothesis that the decision process should not only rely on the input words but also on their K closest neighbors in some semantic space. For that purpose, we present different binary and multi-task classification strategies that include two distinct attention mechanisms based on PageRank. Evaluation results over four gold-standard datasets show that average improvements of 10.6% for binary and 8% for multi-task classification can be achieved over baseline approaches in terms of F[Formula: see text].

We live in an age where vast quantities of information are widely available and easily accessible. Identifying the gist contextualises information which facilitates the fast disambiguation and prediction of related concepts bringing about a set of natural relationships defined between information sources. In this paper, we investigate and introduce a novel unsupervised gist extraction and quantification framework that represents a computational form of the gist based on notions from fuzzy trace theory. To evaluate our purposed framework, we apply the gist to the task of semantic similarity, specifically to few-shot large document classification where documents on average have a large number of words. The results show our proposed gist representation can effectively capture the essential information from a text document while dramatically reducing the features used.","Mar, Jaron; Liu, Jiamou",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,157,1

In this paper, we propose a coupling system which combines 3D object detection and multi-object tracking into one framework. We use the tracked objects as a reference in 3D object detection, in order to locate objects, reduce false or missing alarms in a single frame, and weaken the impact of false and missing alarms on the tracking quality.

Social media data represents the unbiased actual insights of citizens’ concerns that may be mined in making cities smarter. In this study, a computational framework has been proposed using word embedding and machine learning model to detect traffic incidents using social media data. The study includes the feasibility of using machine learning algorithms with different feature extraction and representation models for the identification of traffic incidents from the Twitter interactions. The comprehensive proposed approach is the combination of following four steps. In the first phase, a dictionary of traffic-related keywords is formed. Secondly, real-time Twitter data has been collected using the dictionary of identified traffic related keywords. In the third step, collected tweets have been pre-processed, and the feature generation model is applied to convert the dataset eligible for a machine learning classifier. Further, a machine learning model is trained and tested to identify the tweets containing traffic incidents. The results of the study show that machine learning models built on top of right feature extraction strategy is very promising to identify the tweets containing traffic incidents from micro-blogs.","Chaturvedi, Narayan; Toshniwal, Durga; Parida, Manoranjan",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,157,16

Accordingly, developing medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) fitting into a clinical environment requires identifying/bridging the gap between AI and Healthcare sides. Since the biggest problem in Medical Imaging lies in data paucity, confirming the clinical relevance for diagnosis of research-proven image augmentation techniques is essential. Therefore, we hold a clinically valuable AI-envisioning workshop among Japanese Medical Imaging experts, physicians, and generalists in Healthcare/Informatics. Then, a questionnaire survey for physicians evaluates our pathology-aware Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based image augmentation projects in terms of Data Augmentation and physician training. The workshop reveals the intrinsic gap between AI/Healthcare sides and solutions on Why (i.e., clinical significance/interpretation) and How (i.e., data acquisition, commercial deployment, and safety/feeling safe). This analysis confirms our pathology-aware GANs’ clinical relevance as a clinical decision support system and non-expert physician training tool.

Such representation requires a proper identification of what constitute an edge or a node. Intuitively, nodes represent the junctions where roads intersect, and edges are the road segments connecting these junctions. In practice, however, such simplified presentation is not trivial to achieve due to extra details of individual roads. In this paper, we present a set of novel and efficient computational techniques based on elementary geometry and graph theory that can be employed to obtain the essential structure of a road network, while also retaining the crucial geometry of roads, such as shape and length. This is done by dissecting the network into clusters of nodes of degree other than 2 and curves, which contain consecutive nodes of degree 2, connecting these clusters. These clusters of nodes and curves will be collapsed into cleaned nodes and paths, respectively in a simplified mathematical graph. We apply this method to obtain the simplification of road network in Punggol new town in the northeast region of Singapore, and show that application of network analyses such as centrality measures could be performed in a more meaningful and concise manner than on the original road network.","Huynh, Hoai Nguyen; Selvakumar, Roshini",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,157,16

However, computational times are relatively high. Benchmarks showed that the MPI version of SWAN is not that efficient as the OpenMP version within a single node. Therefore, in a previous paper [5] a hybrid version of SWAN was proposed for computations on structured computational grids. It combines the efficiency of the OpenMP version on shared memory with the capability of the MPI version to distribute memory over nodes. In the current paper we extend this approach by an improved implementation, verification of the model performance with a testbed, and extensive benchmarks of its parallel performance. With these benchmarks for important real life applications we show the significance of this hybrid version. We optimize the approach and illustrate the behavior for larger number of nodes.

Multiple types of uncertainties are considered; including: time-related uncertainty (that exists in lead-time and delay) and quantity-related uncertainty (that exists in information and material flows). The SC model consists of several sub-models, which are first formulated mathematically. Simulation (simulation-based stochastic approximation) and genetic algorithm tools are then developed to evaluate several non-parameterised strategies and optimise two parameterised strategies. Experiments are conducted to contrast these strategies, quantify their relative performance, and illustrate the value of information and the impact of uncertainties. These case studies provide useful insights into understanding to what degree the integrated planning model including production capacity decisions could benefit economically in different scenarios, which types of data should be shared, and how these data could be utilised to achieve a better SC system.

Our vision on 6G is that it will have four new paradigm shifts. First, to satisfy the requirement of global coverage, 6G will not be limited to terrestrial communication networks, which will need to be complemented with non-terrestrial networks such as satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks, thus achieving a space-air-ground-sea integrated communication network. Second, all spectra will be fully explored to further increase data rates and connection density, including the sub-6 GHz, millimeter wave (mmWave), terahertz (THz), and optical frequency bands. Third, facing the big datasets generated by the use of extremely heterogeneous networks, diverse communication scenarios, large numbers of antennas, wide bandwidths, and new service requirements, 6G networks will enable a new range of smart applications with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies.

At present, a problem in gesture recognition is that the researchers did not use the learned knowledge in existing domains to discover and recognize gestures in new domains. For each new domain, it is required to collect and annotate a large amount of data, and the training of the algorithm does not benefit from prior knowledge, leading to redundant calculation workload and excessive time investment. To address this problem, the paper proposes a method that could transfer gesture data in different domains. We use a red-green-blue (RGB) Camera to collect images of the gestures, and use Leap Motion to collect the coordinates of 21 joint points of the human hand. Then, we extract a set of novel feature descriptors from two different distributions of data for the study of transfer learning. This paper compares the effects of three classification algorithms, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), broad learning system (BLS) and deep learning (DL). We also compare learning performances with and without using the joint distribution adaptation (JDA) algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method could effectively solve the transfer problem between RGB Camera and Leap Motion. In addition, we found that when using DL to classify the data, excessive training on the source domain may reduce the accuracy of recognition in the target domain.","Wu, Bi-Xiao; Yang, Chen-Guang; Zhong, Jun-Pei",Int,157,1

Antimicrobial drug development is therefore considered as one of the most practicable research works at present time. Even most of the pharmaceutical companies are investing to develop better therapeutic solutions against the life-threatening infectious diseases caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori, Vibrio cholerae, Entamoeba histolytica, Plasmodium falciparum and many others. These microbial pathogens are not only a curse for human health but also a result in huge economic losses by affecting the health of economically important animals like poultry, cattle and other livestock. Considering the urgency, several effective antibiotics have been developed to combat microbial diseases and are available in the market. However, emergence of resistance against these drugs due to the maluses has created an alarming situation. In this scenario, the use of bioactive noble metal nanoparticles (silver, gold and platinum nanoparticles) has shown better therapeutic efficiency in terms of low treatment dose, less toxicity and absence of microbial resistance. Moreover, the use of several surface modifiers, coating and stabilizing agents resulted in enhancement of the bioactivity, rapid delivery and controlled drug release, improvement of biocompatibility and cytotoxicity. In this chapter, we have presented a comprehensive overview on the antimicrobial efficacy of noble metal nanoparticles along with the mechanistic insights behind their activity at the cellular and molecular level.","Das, Nabarun Chandra; Roy, Bishnupada; Patra, Ritwik; Choudhury, Abhigyan; Ghosh, Madhureema; Mukherjee, Suprabhat",Nanotechnology for Advances in Medical Microbiology,157,13

Although the consumption of these plastics protects our life during this crisis, it is pivotal to move toward plastic recycling processes and environmentally friendly and sustainable alternatives, like bio-based degradable plastics with a circular economy perspective. This review article collected scattered information and provided a future perspective on how worldwide COVID-19 disruption can perform as a catalyst to improve plastic and medical waste management. Additionally, this paper illustrates the most effective disinfection technologies for COVID-19 wastes, such as high/low heat technologies and chemical disinfection, and PPE reusing processes, including dry heat, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and UV light during the outbreak. In this vein, medical waste treatment facilities must be more automatic, with a minimum of personnel involved. Moreover, some recent valid guidelines from different international organizations and countries, future outlook, and practical recommendations that could be effective during this epidemic or even in the post-pandemic world for plastic and medical waste management were provided. Ultimately, governments should improve their waste management because of the potential of pathogen transmission or increased plastic and medical waste generation and try to enhance the environmental knowledge of society. People also should revise their viewpoints on plastic consumption by elevating sustainable behaviors, abandoning old habits, and adjusting to novel ones.","Teymourian, Targol; Teymoorian, Termeh; Kowsari, Elaheh; Ramakrishna, Seeram",Mater Circ Econ,157,13

In view of a large number of genes, multiplied by differential splicing as well as post-translational protein modifications, the ability to identify and quantify the actual phenotypes of individual cell populations in situ, i.e., in their tissue environment, has become a prerequisite for understanding tumorigenesis and cancer progression. The need for quantitative analyses has led to a renaissance of optical instruments and imaging techniques. With the emergence of precision medicine, automated analysis of a constantly increasing number of cellular markers and their measurement in spatial context have become increasingly necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms that lead to different pathways of disease progression in individual patients.

Guidance from the British Orthopaedic Association Standards for Trauma (BOAST) for the ‘management of patients with urgent orthopaedic conditions and trauma during the coronavirus pandemic’, helped structure our service in response to the pandemic. We assessed our compliance with ‘BOAST COVID-19 standards’ pertaining to children to determine whether it is possible to run a safe and effective paediatric orthopaedic service. METHODS: Between the 16th March and 30th April 2020, we performed a prospective audit of clinic and theatre data from the paediatric orthopaedic department at the Bristol Royal Children’s Hospital against the ‘BOAST COVID-19 standards’. We also performed a retrospective audit between 16th March and 30th April 2019 for comparison. RESULTS: Patients booked into acute fracture clinic (AFC) and fracture clinic follow-up (FFO) reduced by 40% and 48% respectively from 2019 to 2020. A virtual fracture clinic (VFC) was implemented with increasing trend in VFC consultations. From 2019 to 2020, the number of patient initiated follow-up appointments increased in AFC and FFO from 16% to 75% and 12% to 35% respectively. Radiography was reduced; only 17% and 39% of AFC and FFO patients respectively required radiographs. On-call referrals and trauma cases reduced by almost 50% with a similar case mix year-on-year. All elective operating was cancelled in 2020. CONCLUSION: By reducing clinic admissions and theatre throughput, it was possible to run an effective paediatric orthopaedic service in a busy tertiary referral centre. Our aim now is to determine the long-term efficacy.","Benning, Matthew Singh; Berwin, James; Knapper, Thomas; Crosswell, Sebastien; Carpenter, Charlotte; Kenall, John; Monsell, Fergal; Thomas, Simon; Benning, Matthew Singh",BJS Open,157,1

In fact, there is a known correlation between Graves’ Disease and mitral valve damage. We present the case of a patient admitted with thyroid storm and heart failure associated with severe structural damage of the mitral valve papillary muscle. Case Report: 24 year old woman with hyperthyroidism diagnosed 12 years ago, treated irregularly with thiamazole and propranolol, leaving treatment a year ago, presents dyspnea, class III functional capacity, diarrhea and logic dysphagia of a month of evolution. Heart rate over 170 bpm, respiratory rate 48 rpm and blood pressure 143/84 mmHg. Physical exam positive for exophthalmos, grade III goiter, crackles in both lung bases, pretibial myxedema and fulfilling criteria for a thyroid storm (65 points in Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale). First Lab Results: TSH<0.005µU/mL, free T4>7.7ng/dl and TRAB 37.8UI/L. Chest ray: Global cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. EKG: Narrow complex supraventricular tachycardia. Thyroid ultrasound: Intrathoracic goiter. Transesophageal echocardiogram: Severe mitral insufficiency (Carpentier Type I and IIIB), right cavities and left ventricular enlargement, preserved right ventricular function and severe pulmonary hypertension (PSAP 71-76 mmHg). First treated with thiamazole, hydrocortisone IV, cholestyramine and sedation, falling time after into ventilatory failure and developing delirium, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Tested positive for COVID- 19. Starts preparation with Lugol and undergoes Total Thyroidectomy. After surgery develops severe hypocalcemia secondary to transitory hypoparathyroidism. During hospitalization presents multiple infections including pneumonia (Pseudomonas Aeruginosa), lung aspergillosis, bacteriuria (Enteroccocus Faecium) and candiduria (Candida Albicans and Glabrata), each one treated with multiple antibiotics and vasoactive drugs. Once stable, mitral valve replacement is realized, after which, the patient progresses favorably being discharged with programmed ambulatory controls. Conclusion: We report a case of a patient who was presented with positive thyroid storm criteria associated with heart failure and severe mitral valve insufficiency. The case gets complicated as multiple infections take place, including COVID-19. Fortunately, because of the early and aggressive multidisciplinary management, the patient evolved favorably, overcoming the life-threatening conditions she went through.

BACKGROUND: Covid-19 infection is associated with coagulopathy and possible heparin resistance, raising concerns that routine heparin during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is failing to achieve adequate anticoagulation. We examined heparin requirements and efficacy in patients treated by PCI before and after the first reported UK case of Covid-19 (January 31st 2020). METHODS: We retrospectively compared heparin dose, Activated Clotting Time (ACT) and coronary flow (TIMI grade) for PCI procedures at a London cardiac centre in the 3 months before the UK pandemic and the three months afterwards. Testing for COVID was not routinely performed. Pre-specified analyses in patients with STEMI, NSTEMI and Stable angina were undertaken. RESULTS: Of 1227 PCI procedures performed over the period of observation, 690 were pre-pandemic and 537 were afterwards. Overall median heparin dose per case was 11000units versus 11500units (p = 0.137) and maximum ACTs were 291s versus 305s, respectively (p = 0.135). Pre-PCI TIMI 3 flow was lower during the pandemic than before (60% v 65%, p = 0.005) but Post-PCI flow was similar (96% versus 96%, p = 0.839). There were no statistically significant differences in heparin dose or achieved ACT among patients with STEMI, NSTEMI or Stable presentations. CONCLUSION: In spite of the increasing evidence that COVID-19 infection causes thrombosis, it appears that standard heparin management during PCI is sufficient to achieve effective anticoagulation and avoid peri-procedural thrombotic complications.","Crane, H; Malik, A; Ssemugabi, E; Sevier, L; Ileka, J; Clottey, C; Bestwick, J; Wald, DS",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,157,26

In this study, we investigated whether a supportive attitude towards IPV is associated with past-year experience of IPV among women in sexual unions in SSA. This study involved a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of 23 countries in SSA. Bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between attitude towards IPV and past-year experience of IPV. The regression results were presented in a tabular form using crude odds ratio (cOR) and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) at 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In the pooled countries, we found that women who had supportive attitude towards IPV were more likely to experience IPV compared to those who rejected IPV (cOR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.64, 1.79), and this persisted after controlling for maternal age, marital status, wealth, maternal education level, place of residence, and mass-media exposure (aOR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.64, 1.79). The same trend and direction of association between attitude towards IPV and experience of IPV was also found in all the 23 studied countries. This study has demonstrated that women who accept IPV are more likely to experience IPV. Hence, we recommend that efforts to end IPV must focus primarily on changing the attitudes of women. This goal can be achieved by augmenting women’s empowerment, education, and employment interventions, as well as sensitizing women in relation to the deleterious ramifications of accepting IPV. Furthermore, reducing IPV is critical towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3.","Aboagye, Richard Gyan; Okyere, Joshua; Seidu, Abdul-Aziz; Hagan, John Elvis; Ahinkorah, Bright Opoku",Healthcare (Basel),157,16

In this study, patients with BM from multiple solid tumors were identified from TriNetX databases, their clinicopathological features were evaluated, and the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy were assessed. METHODS: Variables, including median overall survival (OS), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, primary diagnosis, and date of diagnosis, were retrieved from TriNetX, a real-world database. Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests were applied to assess significance of differences in survival. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) values were calculated. All patient data were deidentified. RESULTS: A total of 227,255 patients with BM were identified in the TriNetX database; median OS was 12.3 months from initial cancer diagnosis and 7.1 months from development of BM. OS of BM from nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were 8.7, 14.7, 17.8, and 15.6 months, respectively. After matching patient baseline characteristics, OS of cohorts with or without exposure to ICIs was evaluated. For all types of cancer, median OS durations for the ICI and no-ICI cohorts were 14.0 and 7.9 months, respectively (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.85–0.91). More specifically, OS was remarkably prolonged in patients with NSCLC (14.4 vs. 8.2 months; HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.82–0.90), TNBC (23.9 vs. 11.6 months; HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.82–0.92), and melanoma (27.6 vs. 16.8 months; HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.73–0.88) if patients had exposure to ICIs. In contrast, there was no significant difference in OS of patients with RCC treated with and without ICIs (16.7 vs. 14.0 months; HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.86–1.10). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, BM indicates poor patient outcome. Treatment with ICIs improves survival of patients with NSCLC, TNBC, and melanoma and BM; however, no significant improvement was observed in RCC.

A three-day curative test was also carried out on Plasmodium berghei-infected mice to determine the effects of the plant extracts (200 mg/kg bw) on parasitemia and biochemical indices of liver and kidney functions, lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress. The study revealed that the extracts possessed phenolic compounds (34.13 ± 1.90 mg GAE/g for Alstonia boonei and 27.99 ± 1.46 mg GAE/g for Carica papaya) and flavonoids (19.47 ± 1.89 mg QE/g for Alstonia boonei and 18.24 ± 1.36 mg QE/g for Carica papaya). In vitro antioxidant activity measured as total antioxidant power, total reducing power, and DPPH radical scavenging activity showed that the extracts possessed higher antioxidant activity than the reference compounds. The outcome of the chemosuppressive test revealed that whereas Plasmodium berghei-infected mice had high parasitemia, decreased mean survival time, exhibited loss of weight, and had low PCV, treatment with the extracts reversed the effects in a concentration-dependent manner. Similarly, the curative test revealed that the extracts significantly suppressed parasitemia compared with the malaria negative control group. This was mirrored by reversal of indices of hepatic toxicity (AST, ALT, and ALP levels), nephropathy (urea and creatinine levels), oxidative stress (SOD, CAT, GPx, GSH, and lipid peroxides), and dyslipidemia (TC, HDL, and TG levels and HMG-CoA reductase activity) in infected but treated mice compared with negative control. Put together, the results of this study demonstrate that the extracts of Alstonia boonei and Carica papaya possess antimalarial properties and are able to ameliorate metabolic dysregulations that characterize Plasmodium berghei infection. The phytoconstituents in these extracts are believed to be responsible for the pharmacological activity reported in this study.","Atanu, Francis O.; Idih, Favour M.; Nwonuma, Charles O.; Hetta, Helal F.; Alamery, Salman; El-Saber Batiha, Gaber",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,157,1

Clumping factor A (ClfA) is a microbial surface protein that promotes S. aureus binding to fibrinogen, and is associated with septic arthritis and infective endocarditis. In order to identify the major human serum proteins that bind the ClfA, we utilized recombinant ClfA region A in a plate-based assay. SDS-PAGE analysis of the bound proteins yielded five prominent bands, which were analysed by MS yielding apolipoprotein E (ApoE) as the predominant protein. ClfA-sufficient S. aureus bound purified ApoE by more than one log greater than an isogenic ClfA-deficient mutant. An immunodot-blot assay yielded a linearity model for ClfA binding to human ApoE with a stoichiometric-binding ratio of 1.702 at maximal Pearson's correlation coefficient (0.927). These data suggest that ApoE could be a major and novel binding target for the S. aureus virulence factor ClfA. Thus, ClfA recruitment of serum ApoE to the S. aureus surface may sequester ApoE and blunt its host defence function against S. aureus-invasive infections to humans. In this context, compounds that can block or suppress ClfA binding to ApoE might be utilized as prophylactic or therapeutic agents.","Elkhatib, Walid F; Hair, Pamela S; Nyalwidhe, Julius O; Cunnion, Kenji M",Journal of medical microbiology,157,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-seven consecutive patients with 57 untreated PAVMs underwent coil embolization with hydrogel-coated coils between January 2013 and Jun 2017. The mean age was 49 years (range 9-83 years), and there were seven male patients and 30 female patients. The median size of the feeding artery was 3.7 mm (range 1.5-6.1 mm), and the median size of the venous sac was 9.3 mm (range 2.6-36.6 mm). For all PAVM, embolization was attempted using 0.018-in. hydrogel-coated coils with or without other coils (0.0135-0.018-in. bare platinum coils and fibered platinum coils). Technical success rate, recanalization rate, and complications were evaluated. Technical success was defined as completion of embolization using hydrogel-coated coils. Recanalization was evaluated with time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography and/or pulmonary angiography. RESULTS In 56 of 57 PAVMs, embolization was successfully performed with hydrogel-coated coils. Therefore, the technical success rate was 98% (56/57). The number of PAVMs at risk was 56, 42, 18, and 12 at 0, 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. There was no recanalization with a mean follow-up period of 19 months (range 2-47 months) in 56 PAVMs embolized with hydrogel-coated coils. There were no major complications. As a minor complication, local pain was observed in 8 of 43 sessions (19%) after embolization. CONCLUSIONS Hydrogel-coated coils may be useful for preventing recanalization after the embolization of PAVMs.","Shimohira, Masashi; Kawai, Tatsuya; Hashizume, Takuya; Muto, Masahiro; Kitase, Masanori; Shibamoto, Yuta",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,157,33

Evolving from this, single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has been successfully utilized for the removal of colonic tumours, but the literature lacks data analysing the suitability of SILS for rectal cancer resection, particularly on oncological outcome. We report the medium-term oncological outcome from a prospective observational study of SILS for rectal cancer, including high and low anterior resections. METHOD A prospective electronic database was collated of all patients undergoing SILS rectal cancer resection in our institution, between 2009 and 2014. In addition to patient, tumour and operative data, histopathological and medium-term oncological end-points were recorded. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to analyse survival. RESULTS Sixty-one patients underwent SILS for rectal cancer by high anterior resection (n = 34), low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision (TME) (n = 24) and low anterior resection with TME and hand-sewn colo-anal anastomosis (n = 3). The median operation time was 105 (37-280) min and 92% of cases were completed by SILS. The mean interval to resuming oral feeding was 11 h and the median length of stay was 2 (1-8) days. The median number of lymph nodes found by the histopathologist in the resected specimen was 18 (6-44) and all operations completely removed the tumour (R0 resection). At a median follow-up of 46 (16-64) months, eight (13%) patients developed metastatic disease, of whom three had local recurrence. Overall, three patients have died, of whom all had metastatic disease. CONCLUSION Anterior resection with TME for rectal cancer can be safely performed using the SILS technique, with acceptable histopathological results and good oncological outcome.","Gash, K; Bicsak, M; Dixon, A",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,157,5

METHODS Male lambs aged 10-12 months (n = 43) were assigned to received ryegrass seed containing lolitrem B, at a dose of 0.16 mg/kg/day (Groups 2, 3 and 4), or lucerne chaff and molasses (Groups 1 and 5). Lambs in Groups 2 and 3 were observed for clinical signs and gait changes until defined signs of PGRT were observed, when they were transferred, with lambs in Group 1, to the Testing phase of the trial. Lambs in Group 3 were then treated with a single oral dose of 300 mg/kg bromide. Lambs in Groups 4 and 5 received KBr daily from the start of the trial (540 mg/kg bromide over 3 days then 20 mg/kg daily) and were transferred to the Testing phase after 18 days. Clinical examination and gait assessment, and surface electromyography of the triceps muscle, measuring root-mean-square (RMS) voltages, were carried out on Days 0, 1 and 2 of the Testing phase followed by necropsy, histopathology, measurement of concentrations of bromide in serum and CSF and faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM). RESULTS In Group 3 lambs, mean composite gait scores decreased between Testing phase Day 0 and Days 1 and 2 (p < 0.001), but increased in lambs in Group 2 between Day 0 and Day 2 (p = 0.015). Scores for lambs in Group 3 on Day 2 were lower than for lambs in Group 2 (p < 0.001). Mean RMS voltages on Day 2 were higher in lambs in Group 2 than Group 3 (p = 0.045). Mean concentrations of bromide in serum were >800 µg/mL in lambs in Groups 3 and 4 on Day 2.

Sternal debridement and flap coverage are the mainstays of therapy, but no consensus exists regarding the appropriate level of debridement. More recently, the use of vacuum-assisted closure devices has been advocated as a bridge to definitive closure, but indications for use remain incompletely defined. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of all chest wall reconstructions performed from January 2000 to December 2010 was conducted. The type of operative management was evaluated to assess morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS Fifty-four patients underwent chest wall reconstruction for poststernotomy mediastinitis. Of these patients, 24 underwent conservative sternal debridement with flap closure, 24 underwent radical sternectomy including resection of the costal cartilages followed by flap closure, and 6 underwent radical sternectomy with vacuum-assisted closure therapy followed by flap closure in a delayed fashion. There were 15 patients in the conservative group and 8 patients in the radical sternectomy group who developed postoperative complications (62.5% vs 33.3%, P < 0.05). The conservative sternectomy group had more serious complications requiring reoperation compared to the radical sternectomy group (86.7% vs 25.0%, P < 0.05). The most common complication in the former group was flap dehiscence (8/15, 53.3%), whereas that in the latter group was a superficial wound infection (6/8, 75.0%). There was no significant difference in mortality (25.0% vs 25.0%, P > 0.05%) or length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS Radical sternectomy including the costal cartilages is associated with lower rates of surgical morbidity and reoperation, but not mortality.","Chang, Eric I; Festekjian, Jaco H; Miller, Timothy A; Ardehali, Abbas; Rudkin, George H",Annals of plastic surgery,157,19

These transporters provide fetal protection against circulating xenobiotics and environmental toxins present in maternal blood. We hypothesized that lipopolysaccharide (LPS-bacterial mimic) alters the yolk sac morphology and expression of key ABC transporters in a gestational-age dependent manner. Yolk sac samples from C57BL/6 mice were obtained at gestational ages (GD) 15.5 and GD18.5, 4 or 24 hours after LPS exposure (150ug/kg; n = 8/group). Samples underwent morphometrical, qPCR and immunohistochemistry analysis. The volumetric proportions of the histological components of the yolk sac did not change in response to LPS. LPS increased Abcg2 expression at GD15.5, after 4 h of treatment (p < 0.05). No changes in Abca1, Abcb1a/b, Abcg1, Glut1, Snat1, Il-1β, Ccl2 and Mif were observed. Il-6 and Cxcl1 were undetectable in the yolk sac throughout pregnancy. Abca1, breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp, encoded by Abcg2) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ Abcb1a/b) were localized in the endodermal (uterine-facing) epithelium and to a lesser extent in the mesothelium (amnion-facing), whereas Abca1 was also localized to the endothelium of the yolk sac blood vessels. LPS increased the labeling area and intensity of Bcrp in the yolk sac's mesothelial cells at GD15.5 (4 h), whereas at GD18.5, the area of Bcrp labeling in the mesothelium (4 and 24 h) was decreased (p < 0.05). Bacterial infection has the potential to change yolk sac barrier function by affecting Bcrp and Abcg2 expression in a gestational-age dependent-manner. These changes may alter fetal exposure to xenobiotics and toxic substances present in the maternal circulation and in the uterine cavity.","Martinelli, L M; Reginatto, M W; Fontes, K N; Andrade, Cbv; Monteiro, Vrs; Gomes, H R; Almeida, Frcl; Bloise, F F; Matthews, S G; Ortiga-Carvalho, T M; Bloise, E",Reproductive toxicology,157,1

Prolonged substance use seems to be associated with morphological changes of multiple neural circuits, in particular the frontal-striatal and limbic pathways. Such neuroadaptations are evident across several substance disorders, but may vary depending on the type of substance, consumption severity and/or other unknown factors. We therefore identified studies investigating the effects of SUDs using volumetric whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in gray (GM) and white matter (WM). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of VBM studies using the anatomic likelihood estimation (ALE) method implemented in GingerALE (PROSPERO pre-registration CRD42017071222 ). Sixty studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the final quantitative meta-analysis, with a total of 614 foci, 94 experiments and 4938 participants. We found convergence and divergence in brain regions and volume effects (higher vs. lower volume) in GM and WM depending on the severity of the consumption pattern and type of substance used. Convergent pathology was evident across substances in GM of the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, putamen, and thalamus, and in WM of the thalamic radiation and internal capsule bundle. Divergent pathology between occasional use (cortical pathology) and addiction (cortical-subcortical pathology) provides evidence of a possible top-down neuroadaptation. Our findings indicate particular brain morphometry alterations in SUDs, which may inform our understanding of disease progression and ultimately therapeutic approaches.","Pando-Naude, Victor; Toxto, Sebastian; Fernandez-Lozano, Sofia; Parsons, Christine E; Alcauter, Sarael; Garza-Villarreal, Eduardo A",Translational psychiatry,157,1

We conducted a random effects meta-analysis of risk ratios (RR) of HIV infection and assessed heterogeneity using Chi2 and I2 tests. Sources of heterogeneity were investigated through subgroup analysis, publication bias was assessed using funnel plots, and certainty of evidence was graded using GRADEPro software. RESULTS We included 18 RCTs which enrolled 40,048 sexually-active, HIV-negative, non-pregnant women, aged 16 years and older, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa. The intravaginal ring containing Dapivirine significantly reduced HIV risk by 29% (RR 0.71, 95%CI:0.57-0.89; 2 RCTs, 4,564 women, moderate certainty of evidence). Estimates of effect of Tenofovir 1% (RR 0.83, 95%CI:0.65-1.06), Nonoxynol-9 (RR 1.15, 95%CI:0.93-1.42), cellulose-sulphate (RR 1.16, 95%CI:0.61-2.21), SAVVY (RR 1.34, 95%CI:0.69-2.59), Carraguard (RR 0.89, 95%CI:0.71-1.10), BufferGel (RR 1.02, 95%CI:0.71-1.46), 0.5% PRO2000 (RR 0.88, 95%CI:0.60-1.28) and 2% PRO2000 (RR 0.81, 95%CI:0.58-1.12) failed to reach statistical significance; each had low certainty of evidence. CONCLUSION The long-acting intravaginal ring containing Dapivirine significantly reduced risk of HIV transmission in women by 29%. The remaining microbicides had no evident effect.","Musekiwa, Alfred; Fernando, Nimasha B; Abariga, Samuel A",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,157,31

Methods This study was conducted in a consecutive series of 130 patients. 134 procedures were performed for treating these patients in Hanoi Medical University Hospital and Bach Mai Hospital from January 2012 to April 2017. 143 flow diverter stents (Pipeline, FRED and SILK) were used. Aneurysm morphology, stent patency and cerebral parenchyma before and after intervention were analyzed on images of digital subtraction angiography (DSA), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR). The follow-up data after 3-6 months and 12 months were recorded. Results In 130 patients (31 men, 99 women), aneurysms of internal carotid artery were mostly common (92.6%), especially in cavernous (35.1%) and in para-ophthalmic (40.3%) segments. 83 cases (61.9%) had wide-neck aneurysms, and 16 cases (11.9%) had multiple aneurysms, and only 5 cases (3.7%) had blister-liked aneurysms. Endovascular treatment was successfully performed at rate of 94.8%. In 3 patients, the stent could not be delivered. Mortality and morbidity rates were 1.5% and 3.7%, respectively. MRI and MSCT follow-up at 3 months showed complete or incomplete occlusions of aneurysms was 7.4% or 17.5%, respectively. 3 patients experienced a thromboembolic event (4.3%). Conclusions Intracranial aneurysms of cavernous and para-ophthalmic segments of internal carotid artery are mostly common with wide-neck and multi aneurysms. Deployment of flow diverter stent is safe and effective with high rate of successful and low procedural complications.","Binh, Nguyen Thai; Luu, Vu Dang; Thong, Pham Minh; Cuong, Nguyen Ngoc; Anh, Nguyen Quang; Tuan, Tran Anh; Linh, Le Tuan; Thien, Nguyen Tat; Uddin, Md Jamal; Dinh, Thien Chu; Chu, Dinh-Toi",Heliyon,157,17

The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has imposed severe restrictions to such an interventional environment. The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 is transmitted mainly through expelled respiratory particles, which are known to travel approximately 3-6 feet away from infected persons. During PCI, that contamination range obligatorily poses the team and the patient to direct air exposure. We herein present a case report with the description of a minimum-contact strategy to reduce interpersonal air exposure during PCI. The approach designed to minimize proximity between the patient and the healthcare team included the performance of robotic-assisted PCI, operated by unscrubbed cardiac interventionalists from a control cockpit located outside the catheterization suite. Also included, was the delineation of the potential zone of respiratory particle spread; a circle measuring 4 meters (13.1 feet) in diameter was traced on the floor of the cath lab with red tape, centered on the patient's mouth and nose. The team was rigorously trained and advised to minimize time spent within the 4-meter perimeter as much as possible during the procedure. Following this strategy, a 60-year-old male with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and COVID-19 was treated with successful coronary implantation of two stents in the obtuse marginal branch and one stent in the circumflex artery. The total duration of the procedure was 103 minutes and 22 seconds. During most of the procedure, the 4-meter spread zone was not entered by any personnel. For each individual team member, the proposed strategy was effective in ensuring that they stayed outside of the 4-meter area for the majority of their work time, ranging from 96.9% to 59.7% of their respective participation. This case report illustrates the potential of robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention in reducing physical proximity between the team and the patient during the procedure.","Lemos, Pedro A; Franken, Marcelo; Mariani, Jose; Pitta, Fabio G; Oliveira, Fredric A P; Cunha-Lima, Gabriella; Caixeta, Adriano M; Almeida, Breno O; Garcia, Rodrigo G",Cardiovascular diagnosis and therapy,157,26

Objective The objective of the study was to study the safety and outcomes of the administration of CoPla to individuals with severe COVID-19 in an academic medical center. Methods Ten patients were prospectively treated with plasma from COVID-19 convalescent donors. Results Over 8 days, the sequential organ failure assessment score dropped significantly in all patients, from 3 to 1.5 (p = 0.014); the Kirby index (PaO2/FiO2) score increased from 124 to 255, (p < 0.0001), body temperature decreased significantly from 38.1 to 36.9°C (p = 0.0058), and ferritin levels also dropped significantly from 1736.6 to 1061.8 ng/ml (p = 0.0001). Chest X-rays improved in 7/10 cases and in 6/10, computerized tomography scans also revealed improvement of the lung injury. Decreases in C-reactive protein and D-dimer levels were also observed. Three of five patients on mechanical ventilation support could be extubated, nine were transferred to conventional hospital floors, and six were sent home; two patients died. The administration of CoPla had no side effects and the 24-day overall survival was 77%.

One possible explanation for this variance is the use of different approaches to quantify ACB. This systematic review (PROSPERO number CRD42019115918) assessed the prognostic utility of ACB-specific measures on mortality in older individuals. Methods Multiple cross-disciplinary databases were searched from 2006-2018. Observational studies assessing the association between ACB and mortality utilizing ≥1 ACB measure, involving persons aged ≥65 years were included. Screening and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers, with disagreements resolved by a third independent reviewer. Risk of bias and quality of evidence were assessed using Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) criteria. Meta-analysis was conducted where appropriate. Results Of 19,224 titles, 20 articles describing 18 cohort studies involving 498,056 older individuals were eligible. Eight anticholinergic-specific measures were identified; the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale (ACBS, n=9) and Anticholinergic Risk scale (ARS, n=8) were most frequently reported. The evidence base was of poor quality, with moderate to high risk of bias. Meta-analysis showed increased mortality risk. Conclusions There was a modest association between some ACB measures and mortality, with most evidence derived from the ACBS. Studies comparing different measures within the same population were lacking. Analysis was limited by poor generalizability between studies, specifically regarding heterogeneity in methodology and reporting, as well as high risk of bias for most studies in the evidence base.","Graves-Morris, Katherine; Stewart, Carrie; Soiza, Roy L; Taylor-Rowan, Martin; Quinn, Terence J; Loke, Yoon K; Myint, Phyo Kyaw",Frontiers in pharmacology,157,1

Increase in central venous saturation (CvSo2) and decrease in blood lactate level are useful in assessment of adequacy of tissue perfusion. Near-infrared spectroscopy is a noninvasive way to observe real-time changes in regional cerebral saturation and has been used in patients with different brain diseases. There is a small body of literature suggesting that cerebral regional oxygen saturation (CrSo2) monitoring added a value in assessment and management of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to determine if CrSo2 can be used as an indicator of tissue perfusion in ICU patients with shock, and to determine the prognostic value of CrSo2 in survival prediction. METHODS This is a prospective single-center pilot study entailed 20 patients who were diagnosed with shock admitted to adult ICU at King Fahd Military Medical Complex, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The CrSo2 was monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy using Somatic, INVOS Oximeter 5100C (Covidien, Mansfield, Mass) with bilateral frontal electrode and mean value of the 2 readings was taken as well as blood lactate level, CvSo2, mean arterial blood pressure, and cardiac index at baseline time, 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours. All patients with history of cerebrovascular diseases and those who presented with neurological deficits were excluded from the study. RESULTS Significant negative correlation was noticed between CrSo2 and lactic acid at 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours from admission (r=-0.625, -0.711, -0.745, and -0.722, respectively; P=.003, .001, .001, and .001, respectively). Significant positive correlation was noticed between CrSo2 and CvSo2 at 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours from admission (r=0.572, 0.674, 0.527, and 0.757; P=.008, .001, .017, and .001, respectively). In addition, significant positive correlation was found between CrSo2 and mean arterial pressure at 24, 48, and 72 hours from admission (r=0.523, 0.513, and 0.626, respectively; P=.018, .021, and .003, respectively). Significant difference was also detected between the value of CrSo2 in the survivors (12 patients) and the nonsurvivors (8 patients) after 72 hours from admission, as it was 52.58%±7.33% and 44.75%±9.44% (P=.049), whereas it was not significantly different in the first 3 days. CONCLUSIONS Cerebral regional oxygen saturation might be helpful as one of the perfusion parameters in patients with shock and it could have a prognostic value in mortality prediction. However, further studies with larger sample size are still needed to validate these results.","Al Tayar, Ashraf; Abouelela, Amr; Mohiuddeen, Khaja",Journal of critical care,157,20

Little is known about heritability of functional language lateralization. This report describes heritability estimates using functional language laterality and handedness phenotypes in a twin sample previously reported by Wilson and Bishop (2018). Methods: The total sample consisted of 194 twin pairs (49% monozygotic) aged from 6 to 11 years. A language laterality index was obtained for 141 twin pairs, who completed a protocol where relative blood flow through left and right middle cerebral arteries was measured using functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound (fTCD) while the child described animation sequences. Handedness data was available from the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI) and Quantification of Hand Preference (QHP) for all 194 pairs. Heritability was assessed using conventional structural equation modeling, assuming no effect of shared environment (AE model). Results: For the two handedness measures, heritability estimates were consistent with prior research: 0.23 and 0.22 respectively for the EHI and QHP. For the language laterality index, however, the twin-cotwin correlations were close to zero for both MZ and DZ twins, and the heritability estimate was zero. Conclusions: A single study cannot rule out a genetic effect on language lateralisation. It is possible that the low twin-cotwin correlations were affected by noisy data: although the split-half reliability of the fTCD-based laterality index was high (0.85), we did not have information on test-retest reliability in children, which is likely to be lower. We cannot reject the hypothesis that there is low but nonzero heritability for this trait, but our data suggest that individual variation in language lateralisation is predominantly due to stochastic variation in neurodevelopment.","Bishop, Dorothy V M; Bates, Timothy C",Wellcome open research,157,16

Interestingly, MHV has a cell-type-dependent ability to resist the antiviral effects of IFN-alpha/beta. In primary bone-marrow-derived macrophages and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, MHV replication was significantly reduced by the IFN-alpha/beta-induced antiviral state, whereas IFN treatment of cell lines (L2 and 293T) has only minor effects on replication (K. M. Rose and S. R. Weiss, Viruses 1:689-712, 2009). Replication of other RNA viruses, including Theiler's murine encephalitis virus (TMEV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Sindbis virus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and Sendai virus (SeV), was significantly inhibited in L2 cells treated with IFN-alpha/beta, and MHV had the ability to rescue only SeV replication. We present evidence that MHV infection can delay interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) induction mediated by both SeV and IFN-beta but only when MHV infection precedes SeV or IFN-beta exposure. Curiously, we observed no block in the well-defined IFN-beta signaling pathway that leads to STAT1-STAT2 phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus in cultures infected with MHV. This observation suggests that MHV must inhibit an alternative IFN-induced pathway that is essential for early induction of ISGs. The ability of MHV to delay SeV-mediated ISG production may partially involve limiting the ability of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) to function as a transcription factor. Transcription from an IRF-3-responsive promoter was partially inhibited by MHV; however, IRF-3 was transported to the nucleus and bound DNA in MHV-infected cells superinfected with SeV.","Rose, Kristine M; Elliott, Ruth; Martínez-Sobrido, Luis; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,157,0

The subject is extremely visual and has therefore previously been a target for the development of technology enhanced learning initiatives over the last ten years. Today's students have come to expect the integration of technology in the classroom and remotely. They adjust quickly to the innovative use of new applications and software and have begun to integrate it within their own workflow for note taking and study aids. Given the intense drive towards blended deliveries of anatomy as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is easy to picture how the benefits of working in partnership with students (in order to achieve many of these aims) would be possible, particularly in difficult subjects like neuroanatomy. In doing so, it provides anatomists with new opportunities to engage students in a way that aligns well with best practice frameworks for engaging students through partnership. The current United Kingdom guidelines set out by Advance HE (a professional membership scheme for promoting excellence in higher education) strongly encourages the higher education community to seek out appropriate academic contexts where a balance of power can be struck between staff and student to create a community of practice.

There were 19 patients (8 men and 11 women; median age, 69 years; range, 52-88 years) and 19 lung tumors measuring 0.5-2.6 cm (median, 1.6 cm). Thirteen tumors were solid, and 6 were predominantly ground-glass opacity (GGO) on computed tomography. All specimens were pathologically examined using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and additional immunostaining, as necessary. The specimens were analyzed for EGFR and KRAS genetic mutations. The safety and technical success rate of the procedure and the possibility of pathologic diagnosis and genetic mutation analysis were evaluated. RESULTS Major and minor complication rates were 11% (2/19) and 53% (10/19), respectively. Tumor cells were successfully obtained in 16 cases (84%, 16/19), and technical success rate was significantly lower for GGO-dominant tumors (50%, 3/6) compared with solid lesions (100%, 13/13, p = 0.02). Pathologic diagnosis was possible in 79% (15/19) of cases based on H&E staining alone (n = 12) and with additional immunostaining (n = 3).

However, their sterility remains in question. This study investigates the microbiologic effect of this vapocoolant when sprayed after 70 % isopropyl alcohol skin preparation. MATERIALS AND METHODS In 50 healthy volunteers, three skin culture samples were collected: Group 1 prior to alcohol application; Group 2 after preparation with alcohol, and Group 3 after preparation with alcohol followed with vapocoolant spray. Samples were cultured in a blinded fashion and analyzed after 5 days of incubation. Gram staining was performed when cultures were positive. RESULTS Bacterial growth was found in 98 % of samples prior to any skin preparation. This was reduced to 54 % after alcohol use (Group 2). Spraying with the skin refrigerant further reduced bacterial growth to 46 % (Group 3). The results showed a significant reduction in the number of positive bacterial cultures following skin preparation with alcohol and when alcohol prep was followed by vapocoolant spray (p < 0.001) compared to initial cultures. No statistical difference was observed between Groups 2 and 3 (p = 0.74). CONCLUSIONS The use of the vapocoolant spray does not compromise the sterility of the skin following alcohol prep. Both 70 % isopropyl alcohol antiseptic preparation and skin preparation followed by vapocoolant spray significantly reduce skin colonization when compared to unprepared skin (p < 0.001).","Mlynek, Karolina; Lyahn, Hwang; Richards, Bryson; Schleicher, William; Bassiri Gharb, Bahar; Procop, Gary; Tuohy, Marion; Zins, James",Aesthetic plastic surgery,157,1

The purpose of this study was to report its therapeutic efficacy and safety. METHODS From May 2016 to August 2017, we have completed 80 cases of radical resection of esophageal carcinoma using this novel surgical technique. The intraoperative findings and postoperative complications were reported. RESULTS The operation was successfully performed in all patients except for one patient switched from laparoscopic-assisted operation to open surgery. The mean operation duration was 191.4 ± 27 min, and the mean intraoperative blood loss was 147.3 ± 28.9 mL. The mean number of removed lymph node was 21.9 ± 4.1. Five patients (6.4%) who had preoperative type I respiratory failure needed to stay in the intensive care unit for 24 h postoperatively. Postoperative complications included anastomotic leakage (8.9%), anastomotic stricture (21.25%), pleural effusion (9%), and hoarseness postoperative hoarseness (18.8%). The incidence of hoarseness at 3 months postoperation was reduced to 3.8%. All the complications were Clavien-Dindo grades I-III.

Yet most respiratory pathogens are quickly recognized and controlled by a coordinated response involving the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The investigation of pulmonary immunity to respiratory viruses during a primary infection has demonstrated that multiple innate and adaptive immune mechanisms are necessary for efficient antiviral responses, and the inhibition of any single mechanism can have disastrous consequences for the host. Furthermore, the investigation of recall responses in the lung has shown that protection from a secondary challenge infection is a complex and elegant process that occurs in distinct stages.

In response to herbivory and abiotic stresses that vary with latitudes and between ranges, invasive plants may shift their secondary chemicals to facilitate invasion success. However, it remains unclear whether and how invasive plant chemical responses to herbivory and chemical responses to abiotic environments are associated. We conducted large scale field surveys of herbivory on the invasive tallow tree (Triadica sebifera) along latitudes in both its native (China) and introduced ranges (United States) and collected leaf samples for analyses of tannins and flavonoids. We used data on climate and solar radiation to examine these chemical responses to abiotic environments and their variations along these latitudes and between ranges. We also re-analyzed previously published data from multiple common garden experiments on tallow tree to investigate genetic divergence of secondary chemical concentrations between introduced and native populations. We found foliar tannins and herbivory (chewing, sucking) were higher in the native range compared to the invasive range. Allocation to tannins versus flavonoids decreased with latitude in the native range but did not vary in the invasive range. Analyses of previously published common garden experimental data indicated genetic divergence contributes to chemical concentration differences between ranges. Our field data further indicated that the latitudinal patterns were primarily phenotypic responses to herbivory in China while in US they were primarily phenotypic responses to abiotic environments. The variation of tannins may be linked to flavonoids, given tannins and flavonoids share a biosynthesis pathway. Together, our results suggest that invasive plants adjust their secondary metabolism to decrease chemicals that primarily defend against herbivory and increase those that help them to respond to their abiotic environment. These findings deepen our understanding of how invasive plants adapt to biogeographically heterogeneous environments through trade-offs between secondary chemical responses.","Xiao, Li; Ding, Jianqing; Zhang, Jialiang; Huang, Wei; Siemann, Evan",The Science of the total environment,157,17

The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is generally used to decrease these complications, but some patients do not respond to clopidogrel and have a higher risk of stent thrombosis. In cardiology, clinical trials have shown that prasugrel reduced the incidence of ischaemic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome compared with clopidogrel but, according to several authors, prasugrel would produce an increased risk of cerebral haemorrhagic complications. Objective The purpose of this study was to determine whether prasugrel would be more effective than clopidogrel in reducing procedural events in patients with an unruptured aneurysm treated endovascularly with coils and stent. Materials and methods Two hundred consecutive patients with intracranial aneurysms were treated using coiling and stenting procedures. The first 100 patients were administered a dual antiplatelet of aspirin and clopidogrel, while the remaining 100 patients were administered a dual antiplatelet of aspirin and prasugrel. In each group data were collected on procedural and periprocedural haemorrhagic and ischaemic complications. Results Aneurysmal occlusion and haemorrhagic complications rates were identical in both groups. The number of thromboembolic events observed in the two groups of our study did not differ significantly, but the prasugrel group included more wide-neck aneurysms and more flow-diverted stents. Moreover, complications in the prasugrel group were more benign, explaining the significant difference in clinical outcomes between the two groups on Day 30. Conclusions Prasugrel reduces the clinical consequences of thromboembolic complications of endovascular treatment with stenting and coiling of unruptured intracranial aneurysms.","Sedat, Jacques; Chau, Yves; Gaudart, Jean; Sachet, Marina; Beuil, Stephanie; Lonjon, Michel","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",157,1

Iran as one of the most affected countries needs unprecedented effort for monitoring and evaluation of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE To determine the seroprevalance of COVID-19 in Semnan province North-East of Iran. METHODS Six hundred people were randomly selected using the ""SIB data-base"". From 1 to 30 June, 2020, 153 participants of Semnan population were enrolled. Blood, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples were obtained. Prevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies were ascertained using ELISA and Real-Time PCR was conducted to evaluate viral load. Estimates of prevalence were standardized by age and sex, based on the 2015 national census of Semnan province. RESULTS Seroprevalence showed no difference between females and males and no significant association between age and seropositivity. Among total participants, the age and sex adjusted prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection was 19.3% (95% CI, 14.0-26.7 per 100 persons). Approximately 10% of participants had detectable antibodies but showed a negative-PCR result. However, approximately 80% of participants did not show an evidence of infection. CONCLUSION The majority of the population in Semnan province has no detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, Semnan is considered a SARS-CoV-2 susceptible area.

TRIM30alpha promoted the degradation of TAB2 and TAB3 and inhibited NF-kappaB activation induced by TLR signaling. In vivo studies showed that transfected or transgenic mice overexpressing TRIM30alpha were more resistant to endotoxic shock. Consistent with that, in vivo 'knockdown' of TRIM30alpha mRNA by small interfering RNA impaired lipopolysaccharide-induced tolerance.

METHODS Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy was used to characterize the serum metabolome of hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 30) and cirrhosis (n = 29) patients, followed by sequential feature selection combined with linear discriminant analysis to process the multivariate data. RESULTS The concentrations of most metabolites, including proline, were lower in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas the hydroxypurine levels were higher in these patients. As ordinary analysis models failed to discriminate hepatocellular carcinoma from cirrhosis, pattern recognition analysis was used to establish a pattern recognition model that included hydroxypurine and proline.

Outcomes were clinical remission at week 14, survival without treatment discontinuation and survival without UC-related event. RESULTS Among the 225 patients included, clinical remission at week 14 was achieved in 40/154 (26%) patients treated with IFX and in 35/71 (49%) treated with VDZ (P = 0.001). After a propensity score matching analysis, this difference remained significant (odds ratio: 1.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.08-2.56; P = 0.02).

The urgent pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to develop and identify effective medication therapy strategies to combat the COVID-19. AREAS COVERED Here, we summarized and evaluated the current treatment drugs and regimens, and put forward the treatment recommendations, including using the potential repurposed or experimental drugs against COVID-19, e.g., chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), remdesivir (RDV), favipiravir (FPV). We also analyzed the specific drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 ongoing development and formulated the comprehensive treatment regimens based on condition of patients, diseases and drugs as well as concomitant medications. EXPERT OPINION No drugs and vaccines have been proven to be particularly effective against SARS-CoV-2 up to now. The recommended comprehensive medication therapy strategies have already displayed favorable effect in the fight against COVID-19. Research should be focused on the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and vaccines based on high-quality clinical trial evidence, treatment guidelines and expert consensus.","Yang, Xiaolei; Liu, Ye; Liu, Yuping; Yang, Qing; Wu, Xubo; Huang, Xuan; Liu, Huijia; Cai, Weimin; Ma, Guo",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,157,33

Among the most noticeable shortages was the lack of face shields. The urgent demand for PPE induced interdisciplinary cooperation to overcome the shortages, and additive manufacturing proved to be ideal for the crisis situation. OBJECTIVES To investigate the possibilities of implementing additive manufacturing technologies in the interventional fabrication of protective face shields for medical staff. MATERIAL AND METHODS An Ender 3 Pro 3D printer was used to print headbands and Cura 4.4 was chosen as the slicing software. Open source face shield designs were downloaded as standard tessellation language (STL) files and compared. Only models with scientific support were taken under consideration. RESULTS The mean time for producing the headbands tested ranged from 59 min to almost 3 h, depending on the design. After setting up our low budget printer and choosing the Prusa RC 3 protective face shield as the main product, we were able to fabricate about 30 face shields per week at a cost of about €1 each. During 4 weeks, 126 face shields were produced and delivered to various hospital wards, which substantially eased the shortages. CONCLUSIONS Additive manufacturing enables immediate responses to needs in emergency situations, and allows for mass production of personal protective equipment in a short time due the rapid exchange of data among printer users. Despite the unregulated legal situation and insufficient scientific evidence, such protective equipment has been approved by clinicians and is currently used by medical personnel around the world.","Wierzbicki, Jędrzej; Nowacki, Maciej; Chrzanowska, Marta; Matkowski, Rafał; Ziętek, Marcin; Nowacka, Katarzyna; Maciejczyk, Adam; Pawlak-Adamska, Edyta",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,157,12

We assessed whether an ultrasound-assisted technique could reduce the number of needle passes required for block success compared with the landmark-guided technique in patients with abnormal spinal anatomy. METHODS Forty-four patients with abnormal spinal anatomy including documented lumbar scoliosis and previous spinal surgery were randomized to receive either surface landmark-guided or preprocedural ultrasound-assisted spinal anesthesia. All spinal procedures were performed by 1 of 3 experienced anesthesiologists. The primary outcome was the number of needle passes required for successful dural puncture. Secondary outcomes included the success rate on the first pass, total procedure time, periprocedural pain scores, and the incidences of radicular pain, paresthesia, and bloody tap during the neuraxial procedure. Intergroup difference in the primary outcome was assessed for significance using Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS The median (interquartile range [IQR; range]) number of needle passes was significantly lower in the ultrasound group than in the landmark group (ultrasound 1.5 [1-3 {1-5}]; landmark 6 [2-9.3 {1-15}]; P < .001). First-pass success was achieved in 11 (50.0%) and 2 (9.1%) patients in the ultrasound and landmark groups, respectively (P = .007). The total procedure time, defined as the sum of the time for identifying landmarks and performing spinal anesthesia, did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (ultrasound 141 seconds [115-181 seconds {101-336 seconds}]; landmark 146 seconds [90-295 seconds {53-404 seconds}]; P = .888). The ultrasound group showed lower periprocedural pain scores compared with the landmark group (ultrasound 3.5 [1-5 {0-7}]; landmark 5.5 [3-8 {0-9}]; P = .012). The incidences of complications during the procedure showed no significant differences between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS For anesthesiologists with experience in neuraxial ultrasonography, the use of ultrasound significantly reduces the technical difficulties of spinal anesthesia in patients with abnormal spinal anatomy compared with the landmark-guided technique. Our results can lead to practical suggestions that encourage the use of neuraxial ultrasonography for spinal anesthesia in such patients.","Park, Sun-Kyung; Bae, Jinyoung; Yoo, Seokha; Kim, Won Ho; Lim, Young-Jin; Bahk, Jae-Hyon; Kim, Jin-Tae",Anesthesia and analgesia,157,24

Furthermore, VAL and TIA are also employed as feed additives to promote animal growth. However, the illegal use of VAL and TIA could cause a series of hazards to consumers. Here, VAL was designed to be conjugated with bovine serum protein to prepare immunogen. A highly sensitive monoclonal antibody that recognized both VAL and TIA has been successfully produced. Moreover, an immunochromatographic strip assay for rapidly screening VAL and TIA in porcine liver was established with visual detection limits (cutoff values) of 50 and 25 ng/g, respectively. The IC50 values calculated from the equation of the standard curve were 6.06 and 3.45 ng/g and the limits of detection were 0.96 and 0.29 ng/g for VAL and TIA. According to the recovery experiment results, the test strip exhibited acceptable accuracy and precision. Generally, the proposed strip provided a practical tool for the detection of VAL and TIA. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: We produced a highly sensitive monoclonal antibody and developed an immunoassay strip for simultaneously monitoring TIA and VAL. Additionally it was preliminarily confirmed that the rapid detection tool was suitable for screening TIA and VAL in porcine liver.","Na, Guanqiong; Hu, Xiaofei; Sun, Yaning; Kwee, Sharon; Xing, Guangxu; Xing, Yunrui; Zhang, Gaiping",Journal of food science,157,9

There are now several classes of FLT3 inhibitors in development with varying degrees of potency and selectivity for the target, including several in late-phase clinical trials in combination with chemotherapy. Major clinical responses in AML patients receiving single-agent FLT3 inhibitors have been rare, although transient peripheral blood blast reduction is common.

The databases of PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched using a combination of related keywords. All studies with original data, involving detection of SARS-CoV-2 in semen of male patients with COVID-19 or in those who have recovered from it, were included in the study.

In four articles, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in semen, while in the other two articles semen testing showed the presence of the virus in some samples. Testicular discomfort, testicular cell damage, and spermogram disruption were also reported in some studies. We conclude that the study question cannot be answered with this number of studies. Since most of the samples were mild to moderate forms of COVID-19, it is not yet clear what the presence of the virus in semen will be in severe cases. The long-term effects are also vague.

METHODS This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study. Two groups, stripping ≥14 mm and RFA ≥14 mm, of 129 varicose vein disease patients underwent surgical treatment in three specialized clinics. We eliminated symptomatic pathologic reflux with RFA in 64 patients and with stripping in 65 patients. In the postoperative phase, we evaluated the pain level, subcutaneous hemorrhage, and paresthesia. A composite end point with four components was used to analyze the results. These were three clinical adverse effects of the intervention (pain, hemorrhage, and paresthesia) and the technical outcome 1 year after the surgical intervention. RESULTS The frequency of favorable outcomes was 20 (30.8%) in the stripping ≥14 mm group and 61 (95.3%) in the RFA ≥14 mm group (P < .0001). The odds ratio for a favorable outcome between the RFA and the stripping groups was 45.8 (95% confidence interval, 44.5-47.0). The pain clusters that were moderate were created by patients after stripping. These clusters show a link between the pain level on the one hand and an increased body mass index and large vein diameter on the other hand. CONCLUSIONS For large-diameter veins, RFA is superior to stripping in terms of favorable outcomes according to the composite end point chosen. Significant pain after stripping was linked to a large vein diameter and excess weight or adiposis.","Shaidakov, Evgeny V; Grigoryan, Arsen G; Ilyukhin, Evgeny A; Bulatov, Vasily L; Rosukhovskiy, Dmitry A",Journal of vascular surgery.

We previously showed that systemic inflammation induces an accumulation of B cells in the spleen in a CCR6/CCL20-dependent manner. In this study, we evaluated the role of CCR6/CCL20 in the context of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) protein-induced (B cell-dependent) experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found that CCR6 is upregulated on murine B cells that migrate into the CNS during neuroinflammation. In addition, human B cells that migrate across CNS endothelium in vitro were found to be CCR6+, and we detected CCL20 production by activated CNS-derived human endothelial cells as well as a systemic increase in CCL20 protein during EAE. Although mice that lack CCR6 expression specifically on B cells exhibited an altered germinal center reaction in response to MOG protein immunization, CCR6-deficient B cells did not exhibit any competitive disadvantage in their migration to the CNS during EAE, and the clinical and pathological presentation of EAE induced by MOG protein was unaffected. These data, to our knowledge, provide new information on the role of B cell-intrinsic CCR6 expression in a B cell-dependent model of neuroinflammation.","Lee, Dennis S W; Yam, Jennifer Y; Grasmuck, Camille; Dasoveanu, Dragos; Michel, Laure; Ward, Lesley A; Rojas, Olga L; Zandee, Stephanie; Bourbonnière, Lyne; Ramaglia, Valeria; Bar-Or, Amit; Prat, Alexandre; Gommerman, Jennifer L",Journal of immunology,157,28

These variabilities are especially pronounced in multicenter cohorts, where batch effects (i.e. systematic technical artifacts unrelated to biological variability) may introduce biases to machine learning algorithms. To date, manual quality control (QC) has been the de facto standard for dataset curation but remains highly subjective and is too laborious in light of the increasing scale of tissue slide digitization efforts. This study aimed to evaluate a computer aided QC pipeline for facilitating a reproducible QC process of WSI datasets. An open source tool, HistoQC, was employed to identify image artifacts and compute quantitative metrics describing visual attributes of WSIs to the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) digital pathology repository. A comparison in inter-reader concordance between HistoQC aided and un-aided curation was performed to quantify improvements in curation reproducibility. HistoQC metrics were additionally employed to quantify the presence of batch effects within NEPTUNE WSIs. Of the 1814 WSIs (458 H&E, 470 PAS, 438 Silver, 448 Trichrome) from n = 512 cases considered in this study, approximately 9% (163) were identified as unsuitable for subsequent computational analysis. The concordance in the identification of these WSIs among computational pathologists rose from moderate (Gwet's AC1 range 0.43 to 0.59 across stains) to excellent (Gwet's AC1 range 0.79 to 0.93 across stains) agreement when aided by HistoQC. Furthermore, statistically significant batch effects (p < 0.001) in the NEPTUNE WSI dataset were discovered.

Two SO indices were TMM/TFM and ASM/TrFM. The Framingham model was used to calculate CVDR. Sex-specific mediation and moderation effects of bone indicators in the associations between the SO indices and the CVDR were analyzed. After adjusting for age, education, income, alcohol use, and physical activity, the SO indices inversely associated with the CVDR and TBM% inversely mediated those associations in both sexes. BMD inversely mediated those associations in men, while the mediation effects of BMD in women were non-significant or positive. In those aged ≥ 60, the mediation effects were found in TBM% and BMD_LS , but not in BMD_FN.

It has been most commonly reported in individuals who live at lower elevations and travel to elevations above 2500 m, typically in those who do so without any acclimatization. It can also occur in residents of high altitudes who descend to lower altitudes and then return to their native altitude without acclimatization. HAPE is more common in individuals with a history of prior HAPE, very rapid rates of ascent, upper respiratory illness, extreme exertion and cold environmental temperatures, Down's Syndrome, obesity and congenital pulmonary anomalies. Case Presentation Our case discusses a patient presenting to an emergency department in Ohio with severe respiratory distress, hypoxia and a radiograph that showed pulmonary edema without cardiomegaly. Additional history revealed the patient had recently returned from Breckenridge, Colorado (an elevation of approximately 2926 m). The diagnosis of HAPE was recognized and he was appropriately treated. He was educated and will not be returning to high altitude without acclimatization in the future. Conclusion Upon literature review, there has never been a prior documented case of a patient in Ohio with HAPE. Providers must consider altitude illness when evaluating travelers from high altitude destinations, even when traveling to a very low altitude like Ohio, as symptoms may be unresolved by descent alone. This case emphasizes the importance of obtaining relevant historical data including a travel history. It also emphasizes the importance of avoiding early closure of the diagnostic process by only considering common conditions. Finally, the case emphasizes the potential danger of anchoring bias to previously encountered conditions.","Walker, Christina; Miner, Benjamin; Bolotin, Todd",Open access emergency medicine : OAEM,157,1

Confirmation of the origins of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 was enabled by the early sharing of the initial genomic sequence by China in January 2020 and since developed collaboratively on a globally accessible database, supported by the World Health Organization (https://tinyurl.com/rj32fp3).","Phillis, Alison",British journal of community nursing,157,1

With the implementation of lockdown rules, road traffic and outdoor activities were expected to drop, thereby reducing the number of high-energy spinal injuries. Critical non-traumatic spinal conditions like spinal tumours, infections, or compressive pathologies, however, should continue to present as before. We assessed all acute spinal referrals to our tertiary spine unit comparing with the acute activity for a similar time frame in the previous year. The aim was to identify any variance in the acute spinal activity, explain reasons for the discrepancy and identify any learning points. MATERIALS All acute referrals to our tertiary spinal surgery unit made from 01 February 2020 to 30 April 2020 were evaluated. Similar data from the preceding year, i.e. 2019 was evaluated for comparison. Data were analysed for qualitative or quantitative changes in the referral pattern and their subsequent management outcomes. RESULTS Spinal referral numbers reduced by 46.05% during the time frame of February-April 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019 (p < 0.017). Similarly, numbers of high-energy traumatic presentations reduced by 72% (p < 0.002). Referrals for critical spinal conditions declined by two-thirds for spinal infections and more than a third for spinal tumours. Emergency surgical workload waned by 27%, especially more so during the six-week lockdown duration. CONCLUSION Reduction in spinal activity, even for critical spinal conditions, during the pandemic is likely due to a combination of factors like patient behaviour, fear of contracting COVID-19 infection during hospital visit, self-isolation advice, availability of a senior decision maker on the frontlines, and changes in healthcare service provisions. The health crisis may provide an opportunity for optimisation of spinal healthcare services both at the referring hospital and at the tertiary centre.","Ahuja, Sashin; Shah, Pranav; Mohammed, Riaz",British journal of neurosurgery,157,1

Variable success with HAI prevention efforts has suggested that management practices are critical to support clinical infection prevention practices. This study examined hospital leaders' management practices around the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) to identify actions that leaders can take to promote HAI prevention efforts. METHODS We conducted interviews with 420 key informants, including managers and frontline staff, in 18 hospitals across the United States. Interviewees were asked about management practices supporting HAI prevention. We analyzed interview transcripts using rigorous qualitative methods to understand how management practices were operationalized in infection prevention efforts. RESULTS Across hospitals and interviewees, three management practices were characterized as important facilitators of HAI prevention: (1) engagement of executive leadership; (2) information sharing; and (3) manager coaching. We found that visible executive leadership, efficient communication, and frequent opportunities to provide and promote learning from feedback were perceived to promote and sustain HAI prevention efforts. CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide insight into management practices for leaders that support successful HAI prevention. In practice, these tactics may need to be adjusted to accommodate the current restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to maintain HAI prevention efforts as a priority.","McAlearney, Ann Scheck; Gaughan, Alice A; DePuccio, Matthew J; MacEwan, Sarah R; Hebert, Courtney; Walker, Daniel M",American journal of infection control,157,1

On the other hand, an optimized functionalization strategy for efficient protein immobilization is another key to make OFET-based protein biochips accessible with improved detection performance. Herein, a facile functionalization strategy is developed for excellent charge-transport thin films by suppressing the gelation of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based polymer semiconductors with the addition of the glutaraldehyde cross-linking agent. Besides, functional groups are introduced on the device surface for efficient attachment of antibodies as receptors via a condensation reaction, enabling simultaneous determination of α-fetoprotein biomarker and carcinoembryonic antigen biomarker with improved sensitivity and reliability. Therefore, the proposed high-throughput OFET-based protein biochip has the potential to be widely utilized in early liver cancer diagnosis.","Sun, Chenfang; Vinayak, Manikkedath V; Cheng, Shanshan; Hu, Wenping",Analytical chemistry,157,32

Compromised tissue oxygenation is one of the root causes of dysfunction of various organs and postoperative complications. Oxygenation of different tissue beds may follow different patterns of change during physiological derangement. Methods. Patients undergoing elective major posterior spine surgery participated in this prospective observational study. Cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO 2 ) was monitored on the upper forehead and muscular tissue oxygen saturation (SmtO 2 ) on the lower leg. The associations of various oxygenation indices with postoperative composite complications and length of hospital stay (LOH) were investigated. Results. The number of composite complications per patient was 3 (2) while the LOH was 6 (3) days (n = 102). Multiple SmtO 2 indices (maximum, minimum, mean, median, and area under curve (AUC)) were associated with composite complications (univariate analysis, P < 0.05). No SctO 2 indices were associated with complications. Multiple SmtO 2 indices (maximum, mean, median, and AUC) showed differences ( P < 0.05) between patients with composite complications ≤3 and >3, respectively. SmtO 2 standard deviation, AUC, and AUC weighted, and SctO 2 standard deviation, were associated with LOH (univariate analysis, P < 0.05). Two SmtO 2 indices (AUC and AUC weighted), showed differences ( P < 0.05) between the patients with an LOH ≤6 and >6 days, respectively. SmtO 2 , but not SctO 2 , indices improved the adjusted R 2 for composite complications (+54.0%, P = 0.0001) and LOH (+19.0%, P = 0.02) based on multiple linear models. Conclusions.

Current research posits that younger adults without persisting health conditions may be at reduced risk for complications of COVID-19 infection. However, young adults are often in unstable places in their careers, education, and social lives, which may be more disrupted by policy changes than those of older adults. Thus, it is imperative to identify young adult subgroups who are at increased risk for mental health difficulties to develop targeted interventions to mitigate emotional distress. This study recruited 620 young adults, Ages 18-35 (M = 26.59; SD = 5.24), to determine whether there were differences in self-reported anxiety and depression in the weeks following the pandemic declaration by gender (male, female, or nonbinary) and health status (i.e., the absence of health conditions, the presence of either physical or mental health conditions, and the presence of both physical and mental health conditions) using a 3 × 4 analysis of variance. For both depression and anxiety, nonbinary participants reported the highest levels, followed by female participants. For health status, those with both mental and physical health conditions reported the highest anxiety and depression, followed by those with mental health conditions, physical health conditions, and no health conditions. These findings call for resources to be directed toward individuals who fall into groups reporting greater emotional distress, so that clinicians can intervene as early as possible to prevent mental health decline.

I also argue that an IRB should approve a study only if it has clear and convincing evidence that the study meets all the approval criteria and other relevant, ethical considerations; and that for studies which expose healthy volunteers to significant risks, an IRB should require that evidence be more than clear and convincing as a condition for approval.

However, the mechanisms leading to variation in fetal outcome in response to PRRSV infection are not fully understood. Our objective was to assess targeted immune-related gene expression patterns and pathways in the placenta and fetal thymus to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the resistance/tolerance and susceptibility of fetuses to PRRSV2 infection. Fetuses were grouped by preservation status and PRRS viral load (VL): mock infected control (CTRL), no virus detected (UNINF), virus detected in the placenta only with viable (PLCO-VIA) or meconium-stained fetus (PLCO-MEC), low VL with viable (LVL-VIA) or meconium-stained fetus (LVL-MEC), and high VL with viable (HVL-VIA) or meconium-stained fetus (HVL-MEC). RESULTS The host immune response was initiated only in fetuses with detectable levels of PRRSV. No differentially expressed genes (DEG) in either the placenta or thymus were identified in UNINF, PLCO-VIA, and PLCO-MEC when compared to CTRL fetuses. Upon fetal infection, a set of core responsive IFN-inducible genes (CXCL10, IFIH1, IFIT1, IFIT3, ISG15, and MX1) were strongly upregulated in both tissues. Gene expression in the thymus is a better differentiator of fetal VL; the strong downregulation of several innate and adaptive immune pathways (e.g., B Cell Development) are indicative of HVL. Gene expression in the placenta may be a better differentiator of fetal demise than the thymus, based-on principle component analysis clustering, gene expression patterns, and dysregulation of the Apoptosis and Ubiquitination pathways. CONCLUSION Our data supports the concept that fetal outcome in response to PRRSV2 infection is determined by fetal, and more significantly placental response, which is initiated only after fetal infection. This conceptual model represents a significant step forward in understanding the mechanisms underpinning fetal susceptibility to the virus.","Van Goor, Angelica; Pasternak, Alex; Walker, Kristen; Hong, Linjun; Malgarin, Carolina; MacPhee, Daniel J; Harding, John C S; Lunney, Joan K",BMC genomics,157,1

The Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS) is among the most frequently used instruments to assess perceptions of discrimination in general, as well as specific types of discrimination (e.g., based on race/ethnicity or age). While numerous studies attest to its validity and reliability for racial/ethnic minority groups, no existing study has examined its psychometric equivalence across gender, age, or socio-economic groups. This study fills this gap. HYPOTHESIS We hypothesize that because social hierarchies of race/ethnicity, age, gender and class have different histories and are differently organized and institutionalized in contemporary United States, racial/ethnic, age, gender, and education-based groups differ in the types of discrimination they experience and perceive. As a result, the EDS may not be equivalent across these social groups. METHOD We test this hypothesis by analyzing data from the 2015 US Texas Diversity Study (N=1,049), a telephone survey of English- and Spanish-speaking adults. We examine two forms of the EDS - one focusing on discrimination regardless of attribution and one focusing specifically on discrimination attributed to respondents' race/ethnicity. RESULTS Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses revealed that neither version of the scale generates estimates of discrimination that can be meaningfully compared across all racial/ethnic, age, gender, and education-based groups. CONCLUSIONS Our results urge caution when drawing comparisons of perceived discrimination across diverse social groups based on the EDS and point to avenues for future scale development.","Harnois, Catherine E; Bastos, João L; Campbell, Mary E; Keith, Verna M",Social science & medicine,157,1

We first hypothesized that this local fatigue would not be compensated within the fatigued muscles leading to a decreased knee extension power. Then, we aimed to determine whether this decrease would be compensated by between-joints compensations within the ipsilateral leg and/or an increased contribution of the contralateral leg. Fifteen healthy volunteers were tested during pedaling at 350 W before and after a fatigue protocol consisting of 15 minutes of electromyostimulation on the quadriceps muscle. Motor coordination was assessed from myoelectrical activity (22 muscles) and joint powers calculated through inverse dynamics. Maximal knee extension torque decreased by 28.3%±6.8% (P<.0005) immediately after electromyostimulation. A decreased knee extension power produced by the ipsilateral leg was observed during pedaling (-22.8±12.3 W, -17.0%±9.4%; P<.0005). To maintain the task goal, participants primarily increased the power produced by the non-fatigued contralateral leg during the flexion phase. This was achieved by an increase in hip flexion power confirmed by a higher activation of the tensor fascia latae. These results suggest no adjustment of neural drive to the fatigued muscles and demonstrate no concurrent ipsilateral compensation by the non-fatigued muscles involved in the extension pedaling phase. Although interindividual variability was observed, findings provide evidence that participants predominantly adapted by compensating with the contralateral leg during its flexion phase. Both neural (between legs) and mechanical (between pedals) couplings and the minimization of cost functions might explain these results.","Brøchner Nielsen, N-P; Hug, F; Guével, A; Fohanno, V; Lardy, J; Dorel, S",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,157,5

To better study volitional control at annotated neural population, we have developed an operant neuroprosthetic task with closed-loop feedback system by volitional conditioning of population calcium signal in the M1 cortex using fiber photometry recording. Importantly, volitional conditioning of the population calcium signal in M1 neurons did not improve within-session adaptation, but specifically enhanced across-session neuroprosthetic skill learning with reduced time-to-target and the time to complete 50 successful trials. With brain-behavior causality of the neuroprosthetic paradigm, we revealed that proficiency of neuroprosthetic learning by volitional conditioning of calcium signal was associated with the stable representational (plasticity) mapping in M1 neurons with the reduced calcium peak. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of adenosine A2A receptors facilitated volitional conditioning of neuroprosthetic learning and converted an ineffective volitional conditioning protocol to be the effective for neuroprosthetic learning. These findings may help to harness neuroplasticity for better volitional control of neuroprosthetic training and suggest a novel pharmacological strategy to improve neuroprosthetic learning in BMI adaptation by targeting striatal A2A receptors.","Zhang, Liping; Zhou, Yuling; Liu, Chengwei; Zheng, Wu; Yao, Zhimo; Wang, Qin; Jin, Yile; Zhang, Shaomin; Chen, Weidong; Chen, Jiang-Fan",Neuropharmacology,157,1

In this context, telemedicine has become the effective and affordable choice. In this study we aimed to evaluate the efficiency of telephone visits to determine pulmonary exacerbations and hospitalization rates of children with cystic fibrosis and interstitial lung disease. METHODS A total of 119 children with cystic fibrosis or interstitial lung disease were enrolled and provided cases in which telephone visits were applied during the peak time of the coronavirus disease pandemic in our country. The recordings of respiratory, gastrointestinal and other symptoms, nutrition status, rate of acute pulmonary exacerbation, treatments initiated by telephone visits, referral to hospital and hospitalization were established from the electronic health reports of the patients. RESULTS Thirteen patients (10.9%) were symptomatic, 12 of them (10%) were diagnosed with acute pulmonary exacerbation. One patient was diagnosed with peripheral facial paralysis. Nine patients were recalled to the hospital and seven patients (5.8%) were hospitalised. DISCUSSION Using telemedicine the health status of patients can be defined, and patients can be guided on proper healthcare that they need, especially during the times of pandemics which we are facing.

The aim of this study was to assess the global impact of COVID-19 on endoscopy training from the perspective of endoscopy trainers and to identify strategies implemented to mitigate the impact on trainee education. METHODS Teaching faculty of gastroenterology (GI) training programs globally were invited to complete a 36-question web-based survey to report the characteristics of their training programs and the impact of COVID-19 on various aspects of endoscopy training, including what factors decisions were based on. RESULTS The survey response rate was 52.6% (305 out of 580 individuals); 92.8% reported a negative impact on endoscopy training, with suspension of elective procedures (77.1%) being the most detrimental factor. Geographic variations were noted, with European programs reporting the lowest percentage of trainee participation in procedures. A higher proportion of trainees in the Americas were allowed to continue performing procedures, and trainers from the Americas reported receiving the greatest support for endoscopy teaching. CONCLUSION This study demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on GI endoscopy training internationally, as reported by endoscopy trainers. Focus-optimizing endoscopy training and assessment of competencies are necessary to ensure adequate endoscopy training.","Vignesh, Shivakumar; Butt, Amna Subhan; Alboraie, Mohamed; Martins, Bruno Costa; Piscoya, Alejandro; Tran, Quang Trung; Yew, Damien Tan Meng; Ghazanfar, Shahriyar; Alavinejad, Pezhman; Kamau, Edna; Verma, Ajay M; Mendelsohn, Robin B; Khor, Christopher; Moss, Alan; Liao, David Wei Chih; Huang, Christopher S; Tsai, Franklin C",Clinical endoscopy,157,17

However, the benefits linked to zero pollution at the usage stage can be overturned when considering the upstream processes linked to the raw materials and energy requirements. To better understand the global environmental implications of fuelling heavy transport with hydrogen, we quantified the environmental impacts over the full life cycle of hydrogen use in the context of the Planetary Boundaries (PBs). The scenarios assessed cover hydrogen from biomass gasification (with and without carbon capture and storage [CCS]) and electrolysis powered by wind, solar, bioenergy with CCS, nuclear, and grid electricity. Our results show that the current diesel-based-heavy transport sector is unsustainable due to the transgression of the climate change-related PBs (exceeding standalone by two times the global climate-change budget). Hydrogen-fuelled heavy transport would reduce the global pressure on the climate change-related PBs helping the transport sector to stay within the safe operating space (i.e., below one-third of the global ecological budget in all the scenarios analysed). However, the best scenarios in terms of climate change, which are biomass-based, would shift burdens to the biosphere integrity and nitrogen flow PBs. In contrast, burden shifting in the electrolytic scenarios would be negligible, with hydrogen from wind electricity emerging as an appealing technology despite attaining higher carbon emissions than the biomass routes.","Valente, Antonio; Tulus, Victor; Galán-Martín, Ángel; Huijbregts, Mark A J; Guillén-Gosálbez, Gonzalo",Sustainable energy & fuels,157,1

METHODS We analyzed 319 patients (220 asymptomatic and 99 symptomatic) who underwent carotid angioplasty from 2002 until 2012 for CR that occurred after eversion endarterectomy. During this period, 7993 eversion endarterectomies were done for significant carotid artery stenosis. Significant CR was detected by ultrasound examination and confirmed by digital subtraction angiography or multidetector computed tomography angiography. After angioplasty (with or without stenting), color duplex ultrasound imaging was done after 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. End points encompassed myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death (fatal myocardial infarction, fatal cardiac failure, fatal stroke), and also puncture site hematoma and recurrent restenosis. Primary end points were analyzed as early results (≤30 days after the procedure), and secondary end points were long-term results (>30 days). Variables and risk factors influencing the early-term and long-term results were also analyzed. Median follow-up was 49.8 ± 22.8 months (range, 17-121 months). RESULTS All but one procedure ended with a technical success (99.7%). In the early postoperative period, transient ischemic attack occurred in 2.8% of the patients and stroke in 1.6%, followed by one lethal outcome (0.3%). Stent thrombosis occurred in one patient (0.3%) several hours after the angioplasty, followed by urgent surgery and graft interposition. In the long-term follow-up, there were no transient ischemic attacks or strokes, non-neurologic mortality was 3.13%, and the recurrent restenosis rate was 4.4%. The rate of non-neurologic outcomes during the follow-up was significantly higher in asymptomatic patients than in symptomatic patients (4.54% vs 0%; P = .034). The statically highest rate of transient ischemic attack was verified in patients in whom Precise (Cordis Corporation, New Brunswick, NJ) stents was used (12.2%) and a Spider Fx (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) cerebral protection device (12.5%) was used. Female gender, coronary artery disease, plaque calcifications, and smoking history were associated with an adverse outcome after angioplasty. CONCLUSIONS Carotid artery stenting is safe and reliable procedure for CR after eversion endarterectomy treatment, with low rate of postprocedural complications. Type of stent and cerebral embolic protection device may influence the rate of postprocedural neurologic ischemic events.","Radak, Djordje; Tanaskovic, Slobodan; Sagic, Dragan; Antonic, Zelimir; Babic, Srdjan; Popov, Petar; Matic, Predrag; Rancic, Zoran",Journal of vascular surgery,157,24

In rat PRRT studies, renal protection by the coadministration of lysine was confirmed by histologic examination of kidney specimens indicating nephrotoxicity. In the current study, we investigated dedicated small-animal SPECT/CT renal imaging in rats to monitor renal function in vivo during follow-up of PRRT, with and without lysine. METHODS The following 3 groups of rats were imaged using a multipinhole SPECT/CT camera: controls (group 1) and rats at more than 90 d after therapy with 460 MBq (15 μg) of (177)Lu-DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate without (group 2) or with (group 3) a 400-mg/kg lysine coinjection as kidney protection (n ≥ 6 per group). At 90 and 140 d after therapy, static kidney scintigraphy was performed at 2 h after injection of 25 MBq of (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA). In addition, dynamic dual-isotope renography was performed using 50 MBq of (111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid ((111)In-DTPA) and 50 MBq of (99m)Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine ((99m)Tc-MAG3) at 100-120 d after therapy. RESULTS (111)In-DTPA and (99m)Tc-MAG3 studies revealed a time-activity pattern comparable to those in patients, with a peak at 2-6 min followed by a decline of renal radioactivity. Reduced (111)In-DTPA, (99m)Tc-MAG3, and (99m)Tc-DMSA uptake indicated renal damage in group 2, whereas group 3 showed only a decrease of (99m)Tc-MAG3 peak activity. These results indicating nephrotoxicity in group 2 and renal protection in group 3 correlated with levels of urinary protein and serum creatinine and urea and were confirmed by renal histology. CONCLUSION Quantitative dynamic dual-isotope imaging using both (111)In-DTPA and (99m)Tc-MAG3 and static (99m)Tc-DMSA imaging in rats is feasible using small-animal SPECT, enabling longitudinal monitoring of renal function. (99m)Tc-MAG3 renography, especially, appears to be a more sensitive marker of tubular function after PRRT than serum chemistry or (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy.","Melis, Marleen; de Swart, Jan; de Visser, Monique; Berndsen, Saskia C; Koelewijn, Stuart; Valkema, Roelf; Boerman, Otto C; Krenning, Eric P; de Jong, Marion","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",157,1

However, the relation between elevated TNI and different cardiopulmonary parameters (CPs) within the first 24 hours after ntSAH is unknown. The present study was conducted to investigate the association between TNI and different CP in patients with ntSAH within the first 24 hours of intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive group of 117 patients with ntSAH admitted to our emergency department between January 2008 and February 2017. Blood samples were taken to determine TNI values on admission. Demographic data, baseline Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) score, baseline Fisher grade (FG), norepinephrine application rate (NAR) in µg/kg/min, and inspiratory oxygen fraction (OF) were recorded within the first 24 hours. RESULTS: An increased TNI value was found in 32 (27.4%) of 117 patients. There was a significant correlation between initial elevated TNI and a low WFNS score ( P = .007), a low GCS score ( P = .003) as well as a high OF ( P = <.001). The FG ( P = .27) and NAR ( P = .08) within the first 24 hours of ICU treatment did not show any significant correlation. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, an increased TNI value was significantly associated with a low WFNS score and GCS score on admission. The TNI was a predictor of the need for a higher OF within the first 24 hours after ntSAH so that TNI could be an informative biomarker to improve ICU therapy.","Bender, Michael; Stein, Marco; Uhl, Eberhard; Reinges, Marcus H T",Journal of intensive care medicine,157,1

The objectives of this study were to compare the prognostic ability for severe NHAP of five prediction rules (PSI, CURB-65, M-ATS, R-ATS, España rule), and to evaluate their usefulness to identify patients with less severe disease in the emergency department for outpatient care. METHODS A prospective observational study of consecutive NHAP patients was conducted at a university teaching hospital emergency department in Hong Kong between January 2004 and June 2005. The primary outcome was severe pneumonia (defined as combined 30-day mortality and/or intensive care unit (ICU) admission). RESULTS 767 consecutive NHAP patients were included. Mean (SD) age was 83.4 (9.0) years; 350 (45.6%) were male and 644 (84.0%) had coexisting illness. 95 patients died within 30 days (12.4%), five patients were admitted to the ICU (0.7%) and 98 patients had severe pneumonia (12.8%). Sensitivity and specificity of each decision rule ranged from 37.8% to 95.9% and 15.1% to 87.6% respectively. The overall predictive performance of each rule was between 0.627 and 0.712. The negative likelihood ratios of PSI (0.27) and CURB-65 (0.23) were lower than M-ATS (0.71), R-ATS (0.45) and España (0.39). After excluding 204 patients with either poor functional status or those >90 years of age, sensitivities of M-ATS (96.0%) and R-ATS (100%) improved greatly with negative likelihood ratios of <0.1. CONCLUSION PSI and CURB-65 are useful for identification of patients with less severe NHAP.","Man, S Y; Graham, C A; Chan, S S W; Mak, P S K; Yu, A H Y; Cheung, C S K; Cheung, P S Y; Lui, G; Lee, N; Chan, M; Ip, M; Rainer, T H",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,157,1

Recent epidemiological evidence also demonstrates greater risk of negative birth outcomes following heat exposure during pregnancy, possibly due to thermoregulatory impairments. We aimed to determine (1) the risk of pregnant women exceeding a Tcore of 39.0 °C during moderate-intensity exercise in the heat; and (2) if any thermoregulatory impairments are evident in pregnant (P) versus non-pregnant (NP) women. METHODS Thirty participants (15 pregnant in their second trimester or third trimester) completed two separate exercise-heat exposures in a climate chamber (32 °C, 45%RH). On separate occasions, each participant cycled on a semi-recumbent cycle ergometer for 45 min at a workload representative of a moderate-intensity (1) non-weight-bearing (NON-WB), or (2) weight-bearing (WB) activity. Thermoregulatory responses were monitored throughout. RESULTS The highest rectal temperature observed in a pregnant individual was 37.93 °C. Mean end-exercise rectal temperature did not differ between groups (P:37.53 ± 0.22 °C, NP:37.52 ± 0.34 °C, P = 0.954) in the WB trial, but was lower in the P group (P:37.48 ± 0.25 °C, vs NP:37.73 ± 0.38 °C, P = 0.041) in the NON-WB trial. Whole-body sweat loss was unaltered by pregnancy during WB (P:266 ± 62 g, NP:264 ± 77 g; P = 0.953) and NON-WB P:265 ± 51 g, NP:300 ± 75 g; P = 0.145) exercise. Pregnant participants reported higher ratings of thermal sensation (felt hotter) than their non-pregnant counterparts in the WB trial (P = 0.002) but not in the NON-WB trial, (P = 0.079). CONCLUSION Pregnant women can perform 45 min of moderate-intensity exercise at 32 °C, 45%RH with very low apparent risk of excessive maternal hyperthermia. No thermoregulatory impairments with pregnancy were observed.","Smallcombe, James W; Puhenthirar, Agalyaa; Casasola, William; Inoue, Daniela S; Chaseling, Georgia K; Ravanelli, Nicholas; Edwards, Kate M; Jay, Ollie",Sports medicine,157,1

The error rates may be close to those that kill the virus. Consequently, populations of RNA viruses are represented by heterogeneous sets of genomes with various levels of fitness. This is especially consequential when viruses encounter various bottlenecks and new infections are initiated by a single or few deviating genomes. Nevertheless, RNA viruses are able to maintain their identity by conservation of major functional elements. This conservatism stems from genetic robustness or mutational tolerance, which is largely due to the functional degeneracy of many protein and RNA elements as well as to negative selection. Another relevant mechanism is the capacity to restore fitness after genetic damages, also based on replicative infidelity. Conversely, error-prone replication is a major tool that ensures viral evolvability. The potential for changes in debilitated genomes is much higher in small populations, because in the absence of stronger competitors low-fit genomes have a choice of various trajectories to wander along fitness landscapes. Thus, low-fit populations are inherently unstable, and it may be said that to run ahead it is useful to stumble. In this report, focusing on picornaviruses and also considering data from other RNA viruses, we review the biological relevance and mechanisms of various alterations of viral RNA genomes as well as pathways and mechanisms of rehabilitation after loss of fitness. The relationships among mutational robustness, resilience, and evolvability of viral RNA genomes are discussed.","Agol, Vadim I; Gmyl, Anatoly P",Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,157,24

The method consists of an analytical moment-closure method resulting in a large set of differential equations with stochastic coefficients that are in turn solved via a Smolyak sparse grid collocation method. We discuss the error of the method relative to the dimension of the model and clarify which methods are most suitable for the problem. We apply the method to two typical problems arising in chemical kinetics with time-independent extrinsic noise. Additionally, we show agreement with classical Monte Carlo simulations and calculate the variance over time as the sum of two expectations. The method presented here has better convergence properties for low to moderate dimensions than standard Monte Carlo methods and is therefore a superior alternative in this regime.","Bayati, Basil S",The Journal of chemical physics,157,17

We analysed observational data and clinical trials to explore whether use of DPP-4i modifies the risk of pneumonia. METHODS We identified patients with diabetes in the Veneto Region administrative database and performed a propensity score matching (PSM) between new users of DPP-4 inhibitors and new users of other oral glucose lowering medications (OGLM). We compared the rate of hospitalization for pneumonia between matched cohorts using the Cox proportional hazard model. The same analysis was repeated using the database of a local diabetes outpatient clinic. We retrieved similar observational studies from the literature to perform a meta-analysis. Results from trials reporting pneumonia rates among patients randomized to DPP-4 inhibitors versus placebo/active comparator were also meta-analysed. RESULTS In the Regional database, after matching 6495 patients/group, new users of DPP-4 inhibitors had a lower rate of hospitalization for pneumonia than new users of other OGLM (HR 0.76; 95% C.I. 0.61-0.95). In the outpatient database, after matching 867 patients/group, new users of DPP-4 inhibitors showed a non-significantly lower rate of hospitalization for pneumonia (HR 0.65; 95% C.I. 0.41-1.04). The meta-analysis of observational studies yielded an overall non-significant lower risk of hospitalization for pneumonia among DPP-4i users (RR 0.81; 95% C.I. 0.65-1.01). The meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed no overall effect of DPP-4i on pneumonia risk (RR 1.06; 95% C.I. 0.93-1.20).

A nonameric peptide derived from a prevalent CBFB-MYH11 fusion protein was found to be immunogenic in HLA-B*40:01+ donors. High-avidity CD8+ T cell clones isolated from healthy donors killed CBFB-MYH11+ HLA-B*40:01+ AML cell lines and primary human AML samples in vitro. CBFB-MYH11-specific T cells also controlled CBFB-MYH11+ HLA-B*40:01+ AML in vivo in a patient-derived murine xenograft model. High-avidity CBFB-MYH11 epitope-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) transduced into CD8+ T cells conferred antileukemic activity in vitro. Our data indicate that the CBFB-MYH11 fusion neoantigen is naturally presented on AML blasts and enables T cell recognition and killing of AML. We provide proof of principle for immunologically targeting AML-initiating fusions and demonstrate that targeting neoantigens has clinical relevance even in low-mutational frequency cancers like fusion-driven AML. This work also represents a first critical step toward the development of TCR T cell immunotherapy targeting fusion gene-driven AML.","Biernacki, Melinda A; Foster, Kimberly A; Woodward, Kyle B; Coon, Michael E; Cummings, Carrie; Cunningham, Tanya M; Dossa, Robson G; Brault, Michelle; Stokke, Jamie; Olsen, Tayla M; Gardner, Kelda; Estey, Elihu; Meshinchi, Soheil; Rongvaux, Anthony; Bleakley, Marie",The Journal of clinical investigation,157,1

Advances in medical care have led to survival of increasingly premature infants, as well as infants with more complex medical conditions. Treatment with a ventricular access device (VAD) was reported almost 3 decades ago; however, it is unclear how effective this treatment is in the current population of premature infants. At our institution (from 2004 to present), we treat posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) with a VAD. In order to look at safety and efficacy, we retrospectively combed the medical records of premature children, admitted to Lucile Packard Children's Hospital from January 2005 to December 2009, and identified 310 premature children with IVH. Of these, 28 children required treatment for PHH with a VAD. There were no infections associated with placement of these devices and a very low rate of other complications, such as need for repositioning (7.41%) or replacement (3.75%). Our data show that treatment with a VAD is very safe, with few complications and can be used to treat PHH in this very complex infant population.","Tian, Ashley G; Hintz, Susan R; Cohen, Ronald S; Edwards, Michael S B",Pediatric neurosurgery,157,19

METHODS We used two reviewers to systematically review EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO for qualitative studies that included a neurogenic bladder patient population and were relevant to bladder management. We used a meta-ethnography technique to summarize and synthesize the data. RESULTS We found 13 studies that were relevant. When choosing a bladder management technique (three studies), there were two major themes (bladder management decision makers, and characteristics and risks) that impacted the process. For studies evaluating life with a urinary catheter (five about intermittent catheters, and five about indwelling catheters), relevant themes could be arranged into three consecutive periods: First, a changed life (the initial stage of selecting and using a catheter: coping, teaching and technical challenges, and control and independence). Second, learning to live with a catheter (the practical skill and knowledge that goes into using a catheter: knowledge, adjustments, and normalization). Third, a new life (the acceptance and integration of a catheter into a person's life: problems and benefits, unpredictability, travel and social activities, intimacy and relationships, and dealing with negative emotions). Themes were generally consistent across studies. Conclusions Several important themes were identified from the existing qualitative literature; these can provide insight into how neurogenic bladder patients select a bladder management method, and how physicians can optimize their counseling and the long-term management of these patients.","Welk, Blayne; McGarry, Patrick; Kennelly, Michael; Myers, Jeremy",Neurourology and urodynamics,157,33

Selected biomolecules that are the most commonly chosen as molecular modelling objects in this field are presented. In most of the reviewed works, ligand docking using solely force field methods was performed, employing various molecular targets involved in metabolism and action of estrogens. Other molecular modelling methods such as molecular dynamics and combined quantum mechanics with molecular mechanics have also been successfully used to predict the properties of estrogens and xenoestrogens. Among published works, a great number also focused on the application of different types of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analyses to examine estrogen's structures and activities. Although the interactions between estrogens and xenoestrogens with various proteins are the most commonly studied, other aspects such as penetration of estrogens through lipid bilayers or their ability to adsorb on different materials are also explored using theoretical calculations. Apart from molecular mechanics and statistical methods, quantum mechanics calculations are also employed in the studies of estrogens and xenoestrogens. Their applications include computation of spectroscopic properties, both vibrational and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and also in quantum molecular dynamics simulations and crystal structure prediction. The main aim of this review is to present the great potential and versatility of various molecular modelling methods in the studies on estrogens and xenoestrogens.","Mazurek, Anna Helena; Szeleszczuk, Łukasz; Simonson, Thomas; Pisklak, Dariusz Maciej",International journal of molecular sciences,157,1

Gore-Tex-based waterproof cast liner has been compared with cotton liner and shown to be superior in physician and patient scoring but also has high cost and difficult application. The purpose of this study is to compare newer generation waterproof liners with traditional cotton liner. It is the first study to compare this new waterproof liner and cotton liner in a crossover model, allowing patients to swim in the pool with the cast. METHODS Twenty patients (ages 3-30) with upper extremity injuries were randomized to waterproof-liner or cotton-liner casts made of fiberglass. Patients would switch cast liners halfway between their treatments to fulfill crossover criteria. All fractures were within a 2-week period from original incident. At each clinic visit, patients evaluated comfort parameters through questionnaires, and physicians rated skin condition. Patients were also asked which cast liner they preferred at the end of the study. RESULTS There were no unscheduled cast changes. The waterproof-liner group had better scores for odor (P = .041), sweat (P = .016), and overall physician-rated score (P = .038). There was no significant difference in other patient-rated parameters. Seventy-five percent of patients preferred waterproof casting to the cotton liner. CONCLUSIONS This new waterproof cast liner, compared with cotton cast liner, had better odor, sweat, and overall physician scores. The waterproof liners allow patients to rinse casts daily, and the majority of patients prefer waterproof to cotton liner.","Guillen, Philip T; Fuller, Corey B; Riedel, Barth B; Wongworawat, Montri D",Hand,157,19

The study included a total of 70 patients aged 18-45 years who were hospitalized in our hospital and diagnosed with COVID-19 in Turkey between March and November 2020. Of these, 40 patients required intensive care admission due to macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and 30 patients did not develop MAS or acute respiratory distress syndrome. The frequency of IL-6-174G/C -and 597G/A polymorphisms was determined. There were statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of -174G/C allele and genotype frequency and comparison with Hardy-Weinberg distribution (χ2=10.029, df=1, p=0.002 and χ2=9.998, df=1, p=0.002, respectively). The frequency of the GG genotype was significantly higher in the MAS group compared to the non-MAS group (p=0.002). The G allele was also significantly more frequent in the MAS group compared to the non-MAS group (p=0.032).

It gives the surgeon an accurate three-dimensional view, allowing complex maneuvers while maintaining full control of the theater. We report our experience with this innovative surgery compared with laparoscopy during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, to demonstrate its safety and feasibility. Our single-center study retrospectively identified obese patients who underwent either laparoscopic or robot-assisted gastric bypass procedures over a 2-year period. Demographics, intraoperative outcomes, mortality and morbidity data were collected. Of the 343 gastric bypass procedures identified, 147 were laparoscopic and 196 robotic-assisted. There were significant differences in age and BMI, being younger and more obese in the robotic group (p = 0.001). The mean operative time was longer in the robotic group; the mean additional time was required for docking, otherwise, the surgical time between groups was comparable. Operative time decreased in line with increasing skills. The conversion rate to laparotomy was 1% (robotic group). Morbidity was generally lower in the robotic group compared with laparoscopy, (hemorrhages 2.5% vs. 6.8%, respectively; anastomotic fistulas 0.5% vs. 2.7%). Statistically, results seem to favor robotic assistance. No mortality was observed in either group. The mean hospital stay was significantly shorter in the robotic group (p = 0.007). Robotic gastric bypass is feasible and, within the reach of every laparoscopic surgeon. Its results are comparable to laparoscopy and surgery is facilitated in higher BMI patients.

The vanilloid phytochemicals, which include curcumin, capsaicin, and gingerol, have been shown to alleviate pain. However, there is little to no literature on the interaction of vanilloid phytochemicals with ARs. In this study, photochemical methods were used to generate a novel isomer of curcumin (cis-trans curcumin or CTCUR), and the interactions of both curcumin and CTCUR with the two Gs-linked AR subtypes were studied. Competitive binding assays, docking analysis, and confocal fluorescence microscopy were performed to measure binding affinity; cell survival assays were used to measure toxicity; and cAMP assays were performed to measure receptor activation. Competitive binding results indicated that CTCUR binds to both AR A2A and AR A2B with Ki values of 5 µM and 7 µM, respectively, which is consistent with our docking results. Fluorescence microscopy data also shows binding for A2B and A2A. Cell survival results show that CTCUR and CUR are nontoxic at the tested concentrations in these cell lines. Overall, our results suggest that vanilloid phytochemicals may be slightly modified to increase interaction with Gs-ARs, and thereby can be further explored to provide a novel class of non-opioid antinociceptives.","Hamilton, Luke J; Walker, Michaela; Pattabiraman, Mahesh; Zhong, Haizhen A; Luedtke, Brandon; Chandra, Surabhi",Pharmacological research,157,24

As a result of the pandemic, increased mental health burdens have been recorded in young adults around the world. We sought to understand the association of stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic with symptoms of psychological and emotional distress in young Canadian adults. METHOD Questionnaire respondents were asked about the extent to which they were personally impacted by COVID-19, and symptoms related to depression, anxiety, post-traumatic disorder, and emotional distress. RESULTS Of 84 respondents, most identified as female (74%; 62/84). Overall, 61% (51/84) reported experiencing symptoms of psychological distress related to depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); specifically, 43% (36/84) reported anxiety-related symptoms, 33% (28/84) reported depression-related symptoms, and 6% (5/84) reported PTSD-related symptoms. Individuals with family in settings high risk for COVID-19 infection and individuals who received government aid with a reduction in income were 4.30-fold and 2.80-fold more likely, respectively, to experience symptoms of psychological distress (95% CI 1.31-14.14; p = .013 and 95% CI 1.08-7.25; p = .038, respectively). Visits to social media daily to hourly for COVID-19 related news resulted in a 3.24-fold increase in the likelihood of experiencing depression-related symptoms (95% CI 1.26-8.35; p = .020). CONCLUSION We demonstrate a necessity to focus on alleviating the mental health burdens and contributing stressors within young Canadian adults.

PURPOSE Our aim was to analyze the outcomes after flow diversion among MCA, anterior communicating artery, and distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of 3 databases was performed for studies published from 2005 to 2018. STUDY SELECTION According to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we included studies reporting flow diversion of distal anterior circulation aneurysms. DATA ANALYSIS Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool aneurysm occlusion and complication rates. From the individual patient data, univariate and multivariate analyses were used to test predictors of occlusion and complications. DATA SYNTHESIS We included 27 studies (484 aneurysms). The long-term adequate occlusion rate (O'Kelly-Marotta scale, C-D) was 82.7% (295/364; 95% CI, 77.4%-87.9%; I2 = 52%). Treatment-related complications were 12.5% (63/410; 95% CI, 9%-16%%; I2 = 18.8%), with 5.4% (29/418; 95% CI, 3.2%-7.5%; I2 = 0%) morbidity. MCA location was an independent factor associated with lower occlusion (OR = 0.5, P = .03) and higher complication rates (OR = 1.8, P = .02), compared with anterior communicating artery and distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms. The Pipeline Embolization Device (versus other stents) gave better occlusion rates (OR = 2.6, P = .002), whereas large/giant aneurysms were associated with higher odds of complications (OR = 2.2, P = .03). The rates of occlusion and narrowing of arteries covered by flow-diverter stents were 6.3% (29/283; 95% CI, 3.5%-9.1%; I2 = 4.2%) and 23.8% (69/283; 95% CI, 15.7%-32%; I2 = 80%), respectively. Symptoms related to occlusion and narrowing of the jailed arteries were 3.5% (6/269; 95% CI, 1.1%-5%; I2 = 0%) and 3% (6/245; 95% CI, 1%-4%; I2 = 0%), respectively. LIMITATIONS We reviewed small and retrospective series. CONCLUSIONS Flow diversion among distal anterior circulation aneurysms is effective, leading to adequate aneurysm occlusion in 83% of cases. However, this strategy has some limitations among MCA and larger lesions, especially related to the higher rate of complications. Compared with the other devices, the Pipeline Embolization Device seems to be associated with a higher occlusion rate.","Cagnazzo, F; Perrini, P; Dargazanli, C; Lefevre, P-H; Gascou, G; Morganti, R; di Carlo, D; Derraz, I; Riquelme, C; Bonafe, A; Costalat, V",AJNR.

As the clinical utility of current therapies is limited, new anti-HBV agents and sources for such agents are still highly sought after. Here, we report that Mucroporin-M1, a scorpion venom-derived peptide, reduces the amount of extracellular HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA productions of HepG2.2.15 cells in a dose-dependent manner and inhibits HBV capsid DNA, HBV intracellular RNA replication intermediates and the HBV Core protein in the cytoplasm of HepG2.2.15 cells. Using a mouse model of HBV infection, we found that HBV replication was significantly inhibited by intravenous injection of the Mucroporin-M1 peptide. This inhibitory activity was due to a reduction in HBV promoter activity caused by a decrease in the binding of HNF4α to the precore/core promoter region. Furthermore, we confirmed that Mucroporin-M1 could selectively activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and lead to the down-regulation of HNF4α expression, which explains the decreased binding of HNF4α to the HBV promoter. Moreover, when the protein phosphorylation activity of the MAPK pathway was inhibited, both HNF4α expression and HBV replication recovered. Finally, we proved that treatment with the Mucroporin-M1 peptide increased phosphorylation of the MAPK proteins in HBV-harboring mice. These results implicate Mucroporin-M1 peptide can activate the MAPK pathway and then reduce the expression of HNF4α, resulting in the inhibition of HBV replication in vitro and in vivo.

These nanomaterials are highly responsive to local refractive index (RI) fluctuations, and their RI unit sensitivity can be tuned by varying the chemical composition, geometry, and dimensions of the utilized nanostructures. To improve the sensitivity and LoD values of these nanomaterials, it is common to increase both dimensions and aspect ratios of the fabricated nanostructures. However, limited by the complexity, prolonged duration, and elevated costs of the available nanofabrication techniques, mass production of these nanostructures remains challenging. To address not only high accuracy, but also speed and production effectiveness in these nanostructures' fabrication, our work reports, for the first time, a fast, high-throughput, and cost-effective nanofabrication protocol for routine manufacturing of polymer-based nanostructures with high sensitivity and calculated LoD in the pM range by utilizing anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes as templates.

We demonstrate that these nanostructures can be produced at a high speed and a notably low price, and that they can be efficiently applied for biosensing purposes after being coated with aluminum-doped silver (Ag/Al) thin films. Our platform successfully detected very low concentrations of human C-reactive protein (hCRP) and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein biomarkers in human plasma samples with LoDs of 11 and 5 pM, respectively. These results open new opportunities for day-to-day fabrication of high aspect ratio arrays of nanopillars that can be used as a base for nanoplasmonic sensors with competitive LoD values. This, in turn, contributes to the development of point-of-care devices and further improvement of the existing nanofabrication techniques, thereby enriching the fields of pharmacology, clinical analysis, and diagnostics.","Garifullina, Ainash; Shen, Amy Q",Journal of materials chemistry.

To assess self-reported PA changes, well-being, and priorities of older women across the USA early in the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, a 10-question survey was emailed to 5,822 women, aged over 70 years, who had been assigned to the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Strong and Healthy (WHISH) trial PA intervention and had provided email addresses. The survey assessed general and physical well-being, current priorities, and PA levels before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic and physical function data were collected previously. Descriptive analyses characterized participants' priorities and PA changes from before the pandemic to the time of data collection during the pandemic. Differences in PA change by age, physical function, and geographic region were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis and post hoc Dunn tests. Among 2,876 survey respondents, 89% perceived their general well-being as good, very good, or excellent, despite 90% reporting at least moderate (to extreme) concern about the pandemic, with 18.2% reporting increased PA levels, 27.1% reporting no changes, and 54.7% reporting decreased PA levels. Top priorities ""in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak"" were staying in touch with family/friends (21%) and taking care of one's body (20%). Among priorities related to physical well-being, staying active was selected most frequently (33%). Support for maintaining PA in older populations should be a priority during a pandemic and similarly disruptive events.","Wegner, Lauren; Mendoza-Vasconez, Andrea S; Mackey, Sally; McGuire, Valerie; To, Cynthia; White, Bailey; King, Abby C; Stefanick, Marcia L",Translational behavioral medicine,157,1

Many contributors to bile acid synthesis and transport have previously been reported to be downregulated in patients with BA; yet, the driving factors of the abnormal bile acid synthesis and transport in regard to BA have not been previously studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS Wild type or Ig-α-/- mice were injected with salt solution (control) or rotavirus on day of life 0, and analyses were performed on day of life 14. The mRNA levels of bile acid transporters/nuclear receptors and liver microRNAs (miRNAs) were compared between groups. A mouse hepatocyte cell line was used to examine the effects of innate cytokines on miRNA levels and bile acid transporter/nuclear receptor expression and miRNAs on bile acid transporter/nuclear receptor expression. RESULTS BA mice had significantly increased mRNA expression of innate cytokines and miRNAs known to bind bile acid transporters/nuclear receptors (miRNAs -22-5p, -34a-5p, and -222-3p) and decreased mRNA expression of bile acid transporters and nuclear receptors. In vitro, TNF-α and IL-1β decreased BSEP and CYP7A1 while increasing miRNA-34a-5p and miRNA 222-3p. LXR, SHP, CYP7A1, NTCP, and MRP2 were decreased by miRNA-34a-5p, whereas miRNA-222-3p decreased NTCP and MRP4. TNF-α and IL-1β increased expression of miRNAs 34a-5p and 222-3p and these miRNAs then decrease expression of multiple bile acid transporters and nuclear receptors. CONCLUSIONS Loss of bile acid transporters increases hepatotoxicity via bile acid retention. Therapeutic agents that increase bile acid transport or nuclear receptor functioning should be investigated in BA.","Azeltine, Mark W; Chavez, Emily J; Nemec, Kelsey M; Bednarek, Joseph M; Asokan, Rengasamy; Balasubramaniyan, Natarajan; Zgheib, Carlos; Mack, Cara L; Roach, Jonathan P",The Journal of surgical research,157,24

Racial Disparities in Extrahousehold Kin Resources and the Loss of Homeownership.,15.516212,4.784439,2020-09-08,"Tuberculosis dates back to ancient times but it is not a problem of the past. Each year, millions of people die from tuberculosis. After inhalation of infectious droplet nuclei, Mycobacterium tuberculosis reaches the lungs where it can manipulate the immune system and survive within host macrophages, establishing a persistent infection. The signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF1) is a self-ligand receptor that can internalize gram-negative bacteria and regulate macrophages' phagosomal functions. In tuberculosis, SLAMF1 promotes Th1-protective responses. In this work, we studied the role of SLAMF1 on macrophages' functions during M. tuberculosis infection. Our results showed that both M. tuberculosis and IFN-γ stimulation induce SLAMF1 expression in macrophages from healthy donor and Tohoku Hospital Pediatrcs-1 cells. Costimulation through SLAMF1 with an agonistic antibody resulted in an enhanced internalization of M. tuberculosis by macrophages. Interestingly, we found that SLAMF1 interacts with M. tuberculosis and colocalizes with the bacteria and with early and late endosomes/lysosomes markers (EEA1 and LAMP2), suggesting that SLAMF1 recognize M. tuberculosis and participate in the endolysosomal maturation process. Notably, increased levels of SLAMF1 were detected in CD14 cells from pleural effusions of tuberculosis patients, indicating that SLAMF1 might have an active function at the site of infection. Taken together, our results provide evidence that SLAMF1 improves the uptake of M. tuberculosis by human monocyte-derived macrophages.","Barbero, Angela María; Trotta, Aldana; Genoula, Melanie; Pino, Rodrigo Emanuel Hernández Del; Estermann, Martín Andrés; Celano, Josefina; Fuentes, Federico; García, Verónica Edith; Balboa, Luciana; Barrionuevo, Paula; Pasquinelli, Virginia",Journal of leukocyte biology,157,16

Here, we show that a new class of host protein, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), inhibits IAV infection. We found that HDAC6-overexpressing cells release about 3-fold less IAV progeny, whereas HDAC6-depleted cells release about 6-fold more IAV progeny. The deacetylase activity of HDAC6 played a role in its anti-IAV function as tubacin, a specific small-molecule inhibitor of HDAC6, increased the release of IAV progeny in a dose-dependent manner. Further, as visualized by electron microscopy, tubacin-treated cells showed an increase in IAV budding at the plasma membrane, the site of IAV assembly. Tubacin is a domain-specific inhibitor and binds to one of the two HDAC6 catalytic domains possessing tubulin deacetylase activity. This indicated the potential involvement of acetylated microtubules in the trafficking of viral components to the plasma membrane. Indeed, as quantified by flow cytometry, there was about a 2.0- to 2.5-fold increase and about a 2.0-fold decrease in the amount of viral envelope protein hemagglutinin present on the plasma membrane of tubacin-treated/HDAC6-depleted and HDAC6-overexpressing cells, respectively. In addition, the viral ribonucleoprotein complex was colocalized with acetylated microtubule filaments, and viral nucleoprotein coimmunoprecipitated with acetylated tubulin. Together, our findings indicate that HDAC6 is an anti-IAV host factor and exerts its anti-IAV function by negatively regulating the trafficking of viral components to the host cell plasma membrane via its substrate, acetylated microtubules. IMPORTANCE Host cells produce many proteins that have the natural ability to restrict influenza virus infection. Here, we discovered that another host protein, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), inhibits influenza virus infection. We demonstrate that HDAC6 exerts its anti-influenza virus function by negatively regulating the trafficking of viral components to the site of influenza virus assembly via its substrate, acetylated microtubules. HDAC6 is a multisubstrate enzyme and regulates multiple cellular pathways, including the ones leading to various cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and inflammatory disorders. Therefore, several drugs targeting HDAC6 are under clinical development for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. Influenza virus continues to be a major global public health problem due to regular emergence of drug-resistant and novel influenza virus strains in humans. As an alternative antiviral strategy, HDAC6 modulators could be employed to stimulate the anti-influenza virus potential of endogenous HDAC6 to inhibit influenza virus infection.","Husain, Matloob; Cheung, Chen-Yi",Journal of virology,157,19

METHODS The study group included 53 patients who underwent HALS and 45 patients who underwent SLS for right-sided colon cancer between April 2002 and December 2008. RESULTS The patients in each group were similar in age, American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) score, body mass index, and history of previous abdominal surgeries. Eight patients in the HALS group and no patient in the SLS group exhibited signs of tumor invasion into adjacent structures. No differences were noted in the time to return of normal bowel function, time to toleration of diet, lengths of hospital stay and narcotic usage, and rate of postoperative complications. The median incision length was longer in the HALS group (HALS: 7.0 cm vs. SLS: 4.8 cm, P < 0.001). The HALS group had a significantly higher pathologic TNM stage and significantly larger tumor size (HALS: 6.0 cm vs. SLS: 3.3 cm, P < 0.001). The 5-year overall, disease-free, and cancer-specific survival rates of the HALS and the SLS groups were 87.3%, 75.2%, and 93.9% and 86.4%, 78.0%, and 90.7%, respectively (P = 0.826, P = 0.574, and P = 0.826). CONCLUSION Although patients in the HALS group had more advanced disease and underwent more complex procedures than those in the SLS group, the short-term benefits and the oncologic outcomes between the two groups were comparable. HALS can, therefore, be considered an alternative to SLS for bulky and fixed right-sided colon cancer.","Bae, Sung Uk; Park, Jin Seok; Choi, Young Jin; Lee, Min Ku; Cho, Byung Sun; Kang, Yoon Jung; Park, Joo Seung; Kim, Chang Nam",Annals of coloproctology,157,33

STUDY DESIGN Survey study. METHODS A survey investigating OSC use was sent to the 1,056 members of the North American Airway Collaborative (NoAAC) iSGS1000 cohort in January 2018. Responses were merged with the existing NoAAC data set containing extensive demographic data, disease-specific history, and responses to validated patient-reported outcome measures. RESULTS A total of 755 individuals with iSGS and mean age of 51.8 ± 11.6 years were included (99% female, 98% white, 63% college educated) and 58% were OSC users. Younger age, female gender, and college education were each associated with OSC use (P < .05). Users spent 2.5 ± 3.3 hours per week on the platforms. Time spent on OSC was not associated with total number of prior treatments. Higher disease anxiety (FoP-Q, R = 0.26, P < .001), lower social support (MOS, R = -0.12, P = .037), and lower level of shared-decision-making with the treating physician (SDM-Q9, R = -0.16, P = .007) were weakly associated with more hours spent engaging an OSC. OSC use influenced treatment and physician choice in 35% and 26% of users, respectively. Increased time spent on OSC use was associated with increased influence on patient medical decisions regarding treatment, surgery, and physician choice (P < .05). CONCLUSION OSC engagement is common in patients with iSGS. Disease anxiety, social support, and relationship with the physician may influence OSC utilization. More OSC engagement weakly associated with greater OSC influence on patient medical decision-making. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE N/A.

Given the unique clinical characteristics of youth with ASD, there have been significant efforts to adapt and test mental health interventions for this population. Yet, characterization of the nature and types of interventions adaptations is limited, especially across the wide range of interventions tested for youth with ASD with a focus on implementation factors. Additionally, understanding how these interventions may be implemented in community services is limited. The aims of this systematic review are to characterize the (1) types of interventions tested for co-occurring mental health conditions for youth with ASD; (2) adaptations to mental health interventions for use with youth with ASD; and (3) implementation strategies, outcomes, and determinants of mental health interventions to inform their translation to community service settings. Eighty-three articles testing interventions targeting mental health symptoms in youth with ASD that included implementation factors in analyses were reviewed. The Stirman et al. (2013; 2019) FRAME adaptation, Powell et al. (2012;2015) implementation strategies, and Proctor et al. (2011) implementation outcomes taxonomies were applied to characterize the nature and types of adaptations for use with youth with ASD and types of implementation strategies, outcomes, and determinants used, when available, respectively. Of the interventions examined, the majority (64.1%) were originally designed to target youth mental health concerns and were then adapted to be used with ASD. The most common adaptations included those to the intervention content, particularly adding elements with tailoring or refining aspects of the intervention while maintaining core functions. Half of the articles described at least one implementation strategy used during intervention testing. Fidelity and acceptability were the most frequently examined implementation outcomes, with some examination of appropriateness and feasibility. Nineteen percent of articles described implementation determinants (i.e. barriers/facilitators) of these implementation outcomes. The common adaptations for ASD provide direction for future intervention development and for training community therapists. Further examination, specification, and reporting of implementation strategies and outcomes within ongoing efforts to adapt and interventions to meet the co-occurring mental health needs of youth ASD are needed to facilitate their translation to community settings. Areas for future research as well as clinical implications are discussed.","Dickson, Kelsey S; Lind, Teresa; Jobin, Allison; Kinnear, Mikaela; Lok, Ho; Brookman-Frazee, Lauren",Administration and policy in mental health,157,33

AIM To describe the results of a multicenter prospective registry on patients with PD undergoing plaque incision or and grafting (PIG) or plaque excision and grafting (PEG) with collagen fleece TachoSil, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this procedure. METHODS A prospective non-controlled multicenter study of patients with PD was performed between May 2016 and March 2018. Patients from 10 centers with stable PD for at least 3 months, difficulties in sexual intercourse, normal erectile function with or without pharmacological treatment, curvature >45°, and/or penile shortening and/or complex deformities were included. All patients underwent PIG/PEG with collagen fleece TachoSil. OUTCOMES The main outcome measure of this study were penile curvature correction (intraoperative), penile shortening (intraoperative), erectile function with the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) and the Erection Hardness Score, subjective patient outcomes with non-validated questionnaires, and complications. RESULTS A total of 52 patients were enrolled in the study. The mean (SD) preoperative penile curvature was 72.8° (17.0). PIG was the preferred technique (80.8%). Intraoperatively, complete curvature correction was achieved in 92.3%, and no significant penile shortening was recorded in 80.8% of subjects. Subjective penile shortening was reported in 83.3% of patients at 6 months. No objective measurement of penile curvature and length was recorded during follow-up. No statistically significant difference from the baseline was found in IIEF-5 and Erection Hardness Score at 3 or at 6 months, although 16.7% of men experienced a worsening of IIEF-5 scores and 14.3% required de novo phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor use. 6 months after surgery, 78.5% of men were satisfied with intervention. Swelling and ecchymosis/hematoma were the most common perioperative complications (40.4%). 2 cases (3.8%) of wound infection were recorded. At 6 months, 35.7% of patients reported mild penile hypesthesia. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Our results confirm the high success rate of grafting with TachoSil, and the surgeon perceived low percentage of penile shortening. STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS This is the first multicentre study on patients with PD undergoing grafting with TachoSil without concomitant placement of penile prosthesis. The main limitations are the short follow-up and the relatively small sample size. CONCLUSION Grafting with TachoSil after PIG/PEG in patients with PD is an effective and safe procedure.

There is interest in determining the extent to which frameshifting efficiency can be modulated before virus replication is compromised, and we have addressed this question using the alpharetrovirus Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) as a model system. In RSV, frameshifting is essential in the production of the Gag-Pol polyprotein from the overlapping gag and pol coding sequences. The frameshift signal is composed of two elements, a heptanucleotide slippery sequence and, just downstream, a stimulatory RNA structure that has been proposed to be an RNA pseudoknot. Point mutations were introduced into the frameshift signal of an infectious RSV clone, and virus replication was monitored following transfection and subsequent infection of susceptible cells. The introduced mutations were designed to generate a range of frameshifting efficiencies, yet with minimal impact on encoded amino acids. Our results reveal that point mutations leading to a 3-fold decrease in frameshifting efficiency noticeably reduce virus replication and that further reduction is severely inhibitory. In contrast, a 3-fold stimulation of frameshifting is well tolerated. These observations suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of frameshifting are likely to have potential as agents for antiviral intervention. During the course of this work, we were able to confirm, for the first time in vivo, that the RSV stimulatory RNA is indeed an RNA pseudoknot but that the pseudoknot per se is not absolutely required for virus viability.","Nikolic, Emily I C; King, Louise M; Vidakovic, Marijana; Irigoyen, Nerea; Brierley, Ian",Journal of virology,157,16

Methods We conducted searches in the special L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs regular searches in PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and other 33 sources. We searched for randomized trials and non-randomized studies evaluating the effect of lopinavir/ritonavir versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Two reviewers independently evaluated potentially eligible studies, according to predefined selection criteria, and extracted data using a predesigned standardized form. We performed meta-analyses using random-effect models and assessed overall certainty in evidence using the GRADE approach. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Our search strategy yielded 862 references. Finally, we identified 12 studies, including two randomized trials, evaluating lopinavir/ritonavir, in addition to standard care versus standard care alone in 250 adult inpatients with COVID-19. The evidence from randomized trials shows lopinavir/ritonavir may reduce mortality (relative risk: 0.77; 95% confidence interval: 0.45 to 1.3; low certainty evidence), but the anticipated magnitude of the absolute reduction in mortality, varies across different risk groups. Lopinavir/ritonavir also had a slight reduction in the risk of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, developing respiratory failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, it did not lead to any difference in the duration of hospitalization and may lead to an increase in the number of total adverse effects. The overall certainty of the evidence was low or very low. Conclusions For severe and critical patients with COVID-19, lopinavir/ritonavir might play a role in improving outcomes, but the available evidence is still limited. A substantial number of ongoing studies should provide valuable evidence to inform researchers and decision-makers soon.","Verdugo-Paiva, Francisca; Izcovich, Ariel; Ragusa, Martín; Rada, Gabriel",Medwave,157,1

Normative weeklong data were obtained from 27 matched controls. Each week was represented by the DPI, standard deviation of the difference between the first and second harmonic amplitudes (H1-H2). Results Compared to pretreatment, the DPI significantly decreased in the patient group after surgery (Cohen's d effect size = -0.86) and voice therapy (d = -1.06). The patient group DPI only normalized after voice therapy. Conclusions The DPI produced the expected pattern of improved ambulatory voice use across laryngeal surgery and postsurgical voice therapy in a group of patients with PVH. The results were interpreted as providing new objective information about the role of daily voice use in the etiology and pathophysiology of PVH. The DPI is viewed as an estimate of potential vocal fold trauma that relies on combining the long-term distributional characteristics of two parameters representing the magnitude of phonatory forces (neck-surface acceleration magnitude) and vocal fold closure dynamics (H1-H2). Further validation of the DPI is needed to better understand its potential clinical use.","Van Stan, Jarrad H; Mehta, Daryush D; Ortiz, Andrew J; Burns, James A; Marks, Katherine L; Toles, Laura E; Stadelman-Cohen, Tara; Krusemark, Carol; Muise, Jason; Hron, Tiffiny; Zeitels, Steven M; Fox, Annie B; Hillman, Robert E","Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",157,16

METHODS This is a retrospective study. Records of all patients who underwent this conversion were analyzed. Additionally, patients were contacted to answer a questionnaire on their current clinical condition. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients underwent laparoscopic conversion between September 2007 and June 2016. Indications were peritonitis in 7 patients (leaks after OAGB in 5, perforated marginal ulcer (MU) and blow-out remnant with concomitant leak in one patient each), anastomotic bleeding in one, bile reflux in 6, recalcitrant MU in 4, afferent loop syndrome in 6, postprandial vomiting in 2 (related to anastomotic stenosis and perianastomotic diverticulum, one each), and malnutrition and hypoglycemia both in 1. Thirty-day mortality was zero, complication rate (Clavien-Dindo grade III or more) 5% ((N = 1/20), abscess) when conversion was elective and 50.0% ((N = 4/8), all persisting leaks) when conversion was urgent. All 4 leaks persisting after conversion were successfully treated by endoscopic stenting, despite stent migration in 2 patients. Follow-up was available in 92.9%, for a mean time of 64.5 ± 30.1 months. Successful symptom relief (Likert score 4 or more) was noted for bile reflux and postprandial vomiting. Additionally, malnutrition was corrected. CONCLUSIONS When indicated, conversion of OAGB to RYGB is a safe treatment strategy. In case conversion is performed for leak after OAGB, persisting subclinical leaks are frequent but can be efficiently addressed by endoscopic stenting.","Bolckmans, Roel; Arman, Gustavo; Himpens, Jacques",Surgical endoscopy,157,5

Thus, APRV/BIPAP should reduce requirements for sedation and muscle paralysis, and thereby reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation. Only 17 human, animal, or lung-model studies have examined these claims, either directly or indirectly. Most did not target patients with ALI. Studies on sedation use have serious methodological limitations. Other studies found that APRV/BIPAP either increased WOB and asynchrony, or had no effect on energy expenditure. To supplement the discussion of patient WOB during APRV/BIPAP in ALI, 4 clinical examples showed marked elevation and wide variation in patient WOB. One plausible explanation is that spontaneous breathing is superimposed upon the mechanical ventilation pattern. Thus a variety of ""breathing environments"" exist during APRV/BIPAP that affect patient WOB and respiratory drive differently and perhaps unpredictably. This characteristic of APRV/BIPAP makes WOB comparisons with traditional modes problematic. Furthermore, the theoretical benefits of APRV, in terms of controlling patient WOB, appear particularly limited when lung-protective ventilation is used for ALI patients with high minute ventilation demand. Future research should focus on issues of WOB and synchrony, so that reasonable ventilation protocols can be devised to test clinical outcomes against traditional modes. To date, low-level evidence suggests that promoting spontaneous breathing with APRV/BIPAP may not be appropriate in patients with relatively severe ALI/ARDS.","Kallet, Richard H",Respiratory care,157,30

During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, it was especially important to save operating room resources and to have a shorter ICU stay for patients, when ICUs had insufficient beds. In this context of limited resources, early percutaneous tracheostomy could be an effective way to manage mechanically ventilated patients. Nevertheless, current recommendations suggest delaying or avoiding the tracheotomy in coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Aim of the study was to analyze the hospital mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 patients who had received early percutaneous tracheostomy and factors associated with removal of tracheostomy cannula at ICU discharge. DESIGN Cohort study. SETTING Coronavirus disease 2019 ICU. PATIENTS Adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 3 days after ICU admission. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Three days after ICU admission, 164 patients were present in ICU and included in the analysis. One-hundred and twenty-one patients (74%) were tracheostomized, whereas the other 43 (26%) were managed with translaryngeal intubation only. In multivariable analysis, early percutaneous tracheostomy was associated with lower hospital mortality. Sixty-six of tracheostomized patients (55%) were discharged alive from the hospital. Age and male sex were the only characteristics that were independently associated with mortality in the tracheostomized patients (45.5% and 62.8% in tracheostomized and nontracheostomized patients, respectively; p = 0.009). Tracheostomy tube was removed in 47 of the tracheostomized patients (71%). The only variable independently associated with weaning from tracheostomy at ICU discharge was a faster start of spontaneous breathing after tracheotomy was performed. CONCLUSIONS Early percutaneous tracheostomy was safe and effective in coronavirus disease 2019 patients, giving a good chance of survival and of weaning from tracheostomy cannula at ICU discharge.","Rosano, Antonio; Martinelli, Enrico; Fusina, Federica; Albani, Filippo; Caserta, Rosalba; Morandi, Alessandro; Dell'Agnolo, Piera; Dicembrini, Alessandra; Mansouri, Leila; Marchini, Andrea; Schivalocchi, Valeria; Natalini, Giuseppe",Critical care medicine,157,28

Although many resources exist to guide patient notification about healthcare incidents (eg, bloodborne exposures, disease outbreaks), IMI clusters involve special considerations related to the complex diseases, uncertain exposures, and differential benefits and risks of notification.

METHODS We conducted an observational study on non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients administered dabigatran at different dosing intervals at the Department of Geriatrics, Peking University First Hospital, China. We enrolled 121 consecutive non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients aged ≥60 years on dabigatran therapy (mean age, 79.6 ± 7.4 years); they were administered conventional low-dose dabigatran (110 mg twice daily) or extended-interval dosing with dabigatran (110 mg every 16 h or every 24 h). All patients received follow-up care, and we evaluated the presence of bleeding and thromboembolic events. RESULTS All patients exhibited creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min with an average of 56.6 ± 17.3 mL/min. Sixty-two patients received extended-interval dosing with dabigatran at a mean dose of 117.1 ± 18.6 mg daily. Patients on extended-interval dosing were older; they exhibited lower creatinine clearance and bodyweight and higher CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores. The mean follow-up time was 25.8 ± 15.6 months. No significant differences were observed in the trough and peak values of the activated partial thromboplastin time and in thromboembolic or bleeding events between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION Extended-interval dabigatran dosing in older patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and lower creatinine clearance can maintain activated partial thromboplastin time trough and peak values comparable to the conventional low dose. Physician-prescribed practices regarding dabigatran dosing intervals do not lead to worse outcomes in the above-mentioned population.","Ni, Lianfang; Chen, Xiahuan; Liu, Meilin; Fan, Yan; Fu, Zhifang; Sun, Dan; Zhao, Zhijie",Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeutics,157,16

These biases can potentially result in misdiagnoses, delayed clinical care, and/or patient mismanagement. A range of interventions exists to mitigate cognitive biases. There is a need to understand the relative efficacy of these interventions within the context of eye care practice. PURPOSE The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the evidence relating to interventions for mitigating cognitive biases associated with clinical decision making by eye care professionals. DATA SOURCES Electronic databases (including Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, PsycINFO) were searched from inception to October 2017 for studies investigating interventions intended to mitigate cognitive biases in the clinical decision making of eye care professionals. This review was undertaken in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guidelines. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA To ensure inclusion of all relevant literature, a wide range of study designs was eligible for inclusion, such as randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized trials, interrupted time series and repeated measures, controlled before-after studies, and qualitative studies that were a component of any of these quantitative study designs. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles in duplicate, applying a priori eligibility criteria. RESULTS After screening 2759 nonduplicate records, including full-text screening of 201 articles, no relevant studies were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF FINDINGS Given that cognitive biases can significantly impact the accuracy of clinical decision making and thus can have major effects on clinical care and patient health outcomes, the lack of studies identified in this systematic review indicates a critical need for research within the area of cognitive bias mitigation for decision making within eye care practice.","Shlonsky, Aron; Featherston, Rebecca; Galvin, Karyn L; Vogel, Adam P; Granger, Catherine L; Lewis, Courtney; Luong, My-Linh; Downie, Laura E",Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,157,26

A four-phase approach was applied. Phase 1: Clinical assessment and exploring background history of exercise-associated gastrointestinal symptoms. Phase 2: Individual tailored GastroAxEx laboratory simulation designed to mirror exercise stress, highlighted in phase 1, that promotes EIGS and GIS during exercise. Phase 3: Individually programmed therapeutic intervention, based on the outcomes of Phase 2. Phase 4: Monitoring and readjustment of intervention based on outcomes from field testing under training and race conditions. Nine endurance athletes presenting with EIGS, and two control athletes not presenting with EIGS, completed Phase 2. Two athletes experienced significant thermoregulatory strain (peak core temperature attained > 40°C) during the GastroAxEx. Plasma cortisol increased substantially pre- to post-exercise in n = 6/7 (Δ > 500 nmol/L). Plasma I-FABP concentration increased substantially pre- to post-exercise in n = 2/8 (Δ > 1,000 pg/ml). No substantial change was observed in pre- to post-exercise for systemic endotoxin and inflammatory profiles in all athletes. Breath H2 responses showed that orocecal transit time (OCTT) was delayed in n = 5/9 (90-150 min post-exercise) athletes, with the remaining athletes (n = 4/9) showing no H2 turning point by 180 min post-exercise. Severe GIS during exercise was experienced in n = 5/9 athletes, of which n = 2/9 had to dramatically reduce work output or cease exercise. Based on each athlete's identified proposed causal factors of EIGS and GIS during exercise (i.e., n = 9/9 neuroendocrine-gastrointestinal pathway of EIGS), an individualised gastrointestinal therapeutic intervention was programmed and advised, adjusted from a standard EIGS prevention and management template that included established strategies with evidence of attenuating EIGS primary causal pathways, exacerbation factors, and GIS during exercise. All participants reported qualitative data on their progress, which included their previously presenting GIS during exercise, such as nausea and vomiting, either being eliminated or diminished resulting in work output improving (i.e., completing competition and/or not slowing down during training or competition as a result of GIS during exercise). These outcomes suggest GIS during exercise in endurance athletes are predominantly related to gastrointestinal functional and feeding tolerance issues, and not necessarily gastrointestinal integrity and/or systemic issues. GastroAxEx allows for informed identification of potential causal pathway(s) and exacerbation factor(s) of EIGS and GIS during exercise at an individual level, providing a valuable informed individualised therapeutic intervention approach.","Gaskell, Stephanie K; Rauch, Christopher E; Costa, Ricardo J S",Frontiers in physiology,157,1

Mechanomyography is a non-invasive measure of muscle vibration associated with muscle contraction. Surface electromyogram and mechanomyogram, recorded transcutaneously using sensors placed over the lower intercostal spaces (sEMGlic and sMMGlic respectively), have been proposed to provide non-invasive indices of inspiratory muscle activation, but have not been directly compared to gold standard Pdi and oesEMGdi measures during voluntary respiratory manoeuvres. To validate the non-invasive techniques, the relationships between Pdi and sMMGlic, and between oesEMGdi and sEMGlic were measured simultaneously in 12 healthy subjects during an incremental inspiratory threshold loading protocol. Myographic signals were analysed using fixed sample entropy (fSampEn), which is less influenced by cardiac artefacts than conventional root mean square. Strong correlations were observed between: mean Pdi and mean fSampEn |sMMGlic| (left, 0.76; right, 0.81), the time-integrals of the Pdi and fSampEn |sMMGlic| (left, 0.78; right, 0.83), and mean fSampEn oesEMGdi and mean fSampEn sEMGlic (left, 0.84; right, 0.83).

Here, we report the discovery of two novel parvoviruses closely related to PARV4, porcine hokovirus (PHoV) and bovine hokovirus (BHoV), from porcine and bovine samples in Hong Kong. Their nearly full-length sequences were also analysed. PARV4-like viruses were detected by PCR among 44.4 % (148/333) of porcine samples (including lymph nodes, liver, serum, nasopharyngeal and faecal samples), 13 % (4/32) of bovine spleen samples and 2 % (7/362) of human serum samples that were sent for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus antibody tests. Three distinct parvoviruses were identified, including two novel parvoviruses, PHoV and BHoV, from porcine and bovine samples and PARV4 from humans, respectively. Analysis of genome sequences from seven PHoV strains, from three BHoV strains and from one PARV4 strain showed that the two animal parvoviruses were most similar to PARV4 with 61.5-63 % nt identities and, together with PARV4 (HHoV), formed a distinct cluster within the family Parvoviridae. The three parvoviruses also differed from other parvoviruses by their relatively large predicted VP1 protein and the presence of a small unique conserved putative protein. Based on these results, we propose a separate genus, Hokovirus, to describe these three parvoviruses.

METHODS A total of 10 surgeons with previous experience in conventional laparoscopic surgery performed four surgical tasks through a multi-port laparoscopic access and a SILS access in a porcine model during a first 4-hour working session and a second 2-hour working session. These tasks included (a) introduction of a prosthetic mesh for abdominal wall surgery, (b) manipulation of the mesh inside the abdomen, (c) manipulation of the laparoscopic instruments and (d) mesh insertion to the intraperitoneal abdominal wall and fixation with tackers. The level of mental effort was assessed with the Subjective Mental Effort Questionnaire (SMEQ) and physical discomfort with the Local Experienced Discomfort Scale (LED). RESULTS Seventy percent were men, with a mean age of 45 years and a mean of 18 years of experience in practicing surgery. The SMEQ questionnaire showed a median physical effort of 24.4 (range 9-36.1) points for the multi-port laparoscopic access and 107.4 (range 74.7-128.4) for SILS (p < 0.01). Statistically significant differences between multi-port laparoscopic surgery and SILS were consistently demonstrated in all tasks as well as in both the 4-hour and 2-hour working sessions. The median (interquartile range) score of the LED scale was 12.5 (2-34.5) for tasks during multi-port laparoscopic surgery and 53.5 (29-89.2) for SILS (p < 0.001). All individual tasks were associated with a significantly higher physical effort for SILS than for conventional laparoscopic access, which were also independent of being performed during the 4-hour or 2-hour working periods. CONCLUSIONS Placement and manipulation of a prosthetic mesh for incisional ventral hernia repair is more difficult with SILS than using multi-port laparoscopic access, independently of previous experience with standard laparoscopic techniques. This greater difficulty was observed both in terms of mental effort and physical discomfort. More experimental and clinical studies are needed to define specific training aspects and clinical advantages of incisional ventral hernia repair through SILS.","López-Cano, M; Pereira, J A; Mojal, S; Lozoya, R; Quiles, M T; Arbós, M A; Armengol-Carrasco, M",European surgical research.

Biological meshes offer a novel solution. Among them, Permacol requires a bibliographic analysis of its efficacy and tolerance. DESIGN A bibliographic analysis was carried out on the efficacy and tolerance of Permacol in parietal and general surgery. RESULTS A total of 22 publications described the use of Permacol in digestive surgery. The advantages of Permacol would be usability in contaminated surgical fields, biocompatibility, no erosion of intestinal wall, and less risk of adhesions. The main drawback of Permacol is its high cost. CONCLUSION Even so, Permacol can play an important part in the short-term management of complex or contaminated abdominal wall defects. The lack of long-term studies and the high cost of the implant call for a medical cost-effectiveness assessment to determine the indications for Permacol in parietal and general surgery.","Balayssac, David; Poinas, Anne Claire; Pereira, Bruno; Pezet, Denis",Surgical innovation,157,27

During the last few decades, there has been news of growing antibiotic resistance in group B streptococci to penicillin and different antibiotic agents. This clinical study retrospectively analyzes antimicrobial resistance in inpatients who were diagnosed with group B streptococcal pneumonia. METHODS All of the required information from inpatients who were identified to have group B streptococcal pneumonia was sourced from the database at the Department of Internal Medicine of HELIOS Clinic Wuppertal, Witten/Herdecke University, in Germany, from 2004-2014. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for the different antimicrobial agents that were regularly administered to these inpatients. RESULTS Sixty-six inpatients with a mean age of 63.3 ± 16.1 years (45 males [68.2%, 95% CI 60.0%-79.4%] and 21 females [31.8%, 95% CI 20.6%-43.0%]) were detected to have group B streptococcal pneumonia within the study period from January 1, 2004, to August 12, 2014. Group B Streptococcus had a high resistance rate to gentamicin (12.1%), erythromycin (12.1%), clindamycin (9.1%), and co-trimoxazole (3.0%), but it was not resistant to penicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, or vancomycin (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION No resistance to penicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, or vancomycin was detected among inpatients with pneumonia caused by group B streptococci.","Yayan, Josef; Ghebremedhin, Beniam; Rasche, Kurt",International journal of medical sciences,157,17

Infection is associated with development of variable levels of antibodies with neutralizing activity that can protect against infection in animal models1,2. Antibody levels decrease with time, but the nature and quality of the memory B cells that would be called upon to produce antibodies upon re-infection has not been examined. Here we report on the humoral memory response in a cohort of 87 individuals assessed at 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection. We find that IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody titres decrease significantly with IgA being less affected. Concurrently, neutralizing activity in plasma decreases by fivefold in pseudotype virus assays. In contrast, the number of RBD-specific memory B cells is unchanged. Memory B cells display clonal turnover after 6.2 months, and the antibodies they express have greater somatic hypermutation, increased potency and resistance to RBD mutations, indicative of continued evolution of the humoral response. Analysis of intestinal biopsies obtained from asymptomatic individuals 4 months after the onset of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), using immunofluorescence, or polymerase chain reaction, revealed persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids and immunoreactivity in the small bowel of 7 out of 14 volunteers. We conclude that the memory B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 evolves between 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection in a manner that is consistent with antigen persistence.","Gaebler, Christian; Wang, Zijun; Lorenzi, Julio C C; Muecksch, Frauke; Finkin, Shlomo; Tokuyama, Minami; Cho, Alice; Jankovic, Mila; Schaefer-Babajew, Dennis; Oliveira, Thiago Y; Cipolla, Melissa; Viant, Charlotte; Barnes, Christopher O; Bram, Yaron; Breton, Gaëlle; Hägglöf, Thomas; Mendoza, Pilar; Hurley, Arlene; Turroja, Martina; Gordon, Kristie; Millard, Katrina G; Ramos, Victor; Schmidt, Fabian; Weisblum, Yiska; Jha, Divya; Tankelevich, Michael; Martinez-Delgado, Gustavo; Yee, Jim; Patel, Roshni; Dizon, Juan; Unson-O'Brien, Cecille; Shimeliovich, Irina; Robbiani, Davide F; Zhao, Zhen; Gazumyan, Anna; Schwartz, Robert E; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Bjorkman, Pamela J; Mehandru, Saurabh; Bieniasz, Paul D; Caskey, Marina; Nussenzweig, Michel C",Nature,157,1

When co-occurring, the presence of one disorder typically negatively impacts the prognosis for the other. Given the clinical relevance, we sought to examine pharmacotherapies for co-occurring CUD and MDD. While multiple treatment options have been examined in the treatment of each condition individually, studies exploring pharmacological options for their comorbidity are fewer and not conclusive.Areas CoveredFor this review, the authors searched the literature in PubMed using clinical query options for therapies and keywords relating to each condition. Then, they described potentially promising pharmacologic therapeutic options based on shared mechanisms between the two conditions and/or results from individual clinical trials conducted to date.Expert opinionMedications like stimulants, dopamine (D3) receptors partial agonists or antagonists, antagonists of kappa opioid receptors, topiramate, and ketamine could be promising as there is significant overlap relating to reward deficiency models, anti-reward pathways, and altered glutamatergic systems. However, the available clinical literature on any one of these types of agents is mixed. Additionally, for some agents there is possible concern related to abuse potential (e.g., ketamine and stimulants).","Angarita, Gustavo A; Hadizadeh, Hasti; Cerdena, Ignacio; Potenza, Marc N",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,157,1

Transmission of infection occurs by the fecal-oral route through direct contact among animals. Consequently, feline trichomonosis (FT) is more likely to be present in multi-cat environments. The objective of this work was to study the presence of T. foetus and some associated risk factors in cats from densely housed origins and with a reported history of chronic diarrhea. Animals enrolled in this study were family cats (n=15) acquired from pet shops, shelters or breeding centers and cattery cats belonging to one breeding center (n=28) and two cat shelters (A and B, n=25 each). In the catteries, a follow-up analysis for a period of up to 2 months was also performed to determine the parasite shedding pattern in feces and the incidence of infection. Fecal samples were analyzed using in vitro culture and a PCR technique. T. foetus was detected in a total of 38.7% (36/93) of the cats with chronic diarrhea. Parasite infection was similarly detected in family cats and cattery animals (40% versus 38.4%). In the catteries, the parasite was detected in 50%, 44% and 20% of the animals from the breeding center and shelters A and B, respectively. The follow-up analysis showed that 58.3% of infected cats intermittently shed trophozoites in their feces, with an incidence of 23.1%. Investigation of potential risk factors showed that cats ≤1 year old were more likely to be infected than older cats (57.1% versus 27.3%; P<0.05). No significant differences were found when sex and breed factors were studied. These results confirm the importance of FT as a cause of chronic diarrhea in cats and highlight the relevance of close contact conditions for T. foetus transmission.","Arranz-Solís, David; Pedraza-Díaz, Susana; Miró, Guadalupe; Rojo-Montejo, Silvia; Hernández, Leticia; Ortega-Mora, Luis Miguel; Collantes-Fernández, Esther",Veterinary parasitology,157,16

Despite these known associations, most patients with EAC present with symptoms of dysphagia from late-stage tumors; only a small number of patients are identified by screening and surveillance programs. Diagnostic analysis of EAC usually commences with upper endoscopy followed by cross-sectional imaging. Endoscopic ultrasonography is useful to assess the local extent of disease as well as the involvement of regional lymph nodes. T1a EAC may be treated endoscopically, and some patients with T1b disease may also benefit from endoscopic therapy. Locally advanced disease is generally managed with esophagectomy, often accompanied by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy.

M organizes the components of the viral membrane, and interactions of M with itself and with the nucleocapsid (N) protein drive virus assembly and budding. In order to further define M-M and M-N interactions, we constructed mutants of the model coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in which all or part of the M protein was replaced by its phylogenetically divergent counterpart from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We were able to obtain viable chimeras containing the entire SARS-CoV M protein as well as mutants with intramolecular substitutions that partitioned M protein at the boundaries between the ectodomain, transmembrane domains, or endodomain. Our results show that the carboxy-terminal domain of N protein, N3, is necessary and sufficient for interaction with M protein. However, despite some previous genetic and biochemical evidence that mapped interactions with N to the carboxy terminus of M, it was not possible to define a short linear region of M protein sufficient for assembly with N. Thus, interactions with N protein likely involve multiple linearly discontiguous regions of the M endodomain. The SARS-CoV M chimera exhibited a conditional growth defect that was partially suppressed by mutations in the envelope (E) protein. Moreover, virions of the M chimera were markedly deficient in spike (S) protein incorporation. These findings suggest that the interactions of M protein with both E and S protein are more complex than previously thought. IMPORTANCE The assembly of coronavirus virions entails concerted interactions among the viral structural proteins and the RNA genome. One strategy to study this process is through construction of interspecies chimeras that preserve or disrupt particular inter- or intramolecular associations. In this work, we replaced the membrane (M) protein of the model coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus with its counterpart from a heterologous coronavirus. The results clarify our understanding of the interaction between the coronavirus M protein and the nucleocapsid protein. At the same time, they reveal unanticipated complexities in the interactions of M with the viral spike and envelope proteins.","Kuo, Lili; Hurst-Hess, Kelley R; Koetzner, Cheri A; Masters, Paul S",Journal of virology,157,22

It is thought that differentially phosphorylated protein isoforms might be a useful prognostic biomarker of drug response in the clinic. However, the accurate detection and quantitative analysis of cancer-related protein isoforms and phospho-isoforms in tumors are limited by current technologies. Using a novel, fully automated nanocapillary electrophoresis immunoassay (NanoPro(TM) 1000) designed to separate protein molecules based on their isoelectric point, we developed a reliable and highly sensitive assay for the detection and quantitation of AKT isoforms and phosphoforms in breast cancer. This assay enabled the measurement of activated AKT1/2/3 in breast cancer cells using protein produced from as few as 56 cells. Importantly, we were able to assign an identity for the phosphorylated S473 phosphoform of AKT1, the major form of activated AKT involved in multiple cancers, including breast, and a current focus in clinical trials for targeted intervention. The ability of our AKT assay to detect and measure AKT phosphorylation from very low amounts of total protein will allow the accurate evaluation of patient response to drugs targeting activated PI3K-AKT using scarce clinical specimens. Moreover, the capacity of this assay to detect and measure all three AKT isoforms using one single pan-specific antibody enables the study of the multiple and variable roles that these isoforms play in AKT tumorigenesis.","Iacovides, Demetris C; Johnson, Aimee B; Wang, Nick; Boddapati, Shanta; Korkola, Jim; Gray, Joe W",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,157,1

Outcomes compare primary DES versus percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), overall DES (primary and provisional) versus standard care (PTA and provisional Zilver bare metal stent [BMS]), and provisional DES versus provisional BMS. METHODS AND RESULTS Patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal artery disease were randomly assigned to DES (n=236) or PTA (n=238). Approximately 91% had claudication; 9% had critical limb ischemia. Patients experiencing acute PTA failure underwent secondary randomization to provisional BMS (n=59) or DES (n=61). The 1-year primary end points of event-free survival and patency showed superiority of primary DES in comparison with PTA; these results were sustained through 5 years. Clinical benefit (freedom from persistent or worsening symptoms of ischemia; 79.8% versus 59.3%, P<0.01), patency (66.4% versus 43.4%, P<0.01), and freedom from reintervention (target lesion revascularization, 83.1% versus 67.6%, P<0.01) for the overall DES group were superior to standard care in nonrandomized comparisons. Similarly, clinical benefit (81.8% versus 63.8%, P=0.02), patency (72.4% versus 53.0%, P=0.03), and freedom from target lesion revascularization (84.9% versus 71.6%, P=0.06) with provisional DES were improved over provisional BMS. These results represent >40% relative risk reduction for restenosis and target lesion revascularization through 5 years for the overall DES in comparison with standard care and for provisional DES in comparison with provisional BMS.

There is a long-standing debate about chaos and non-linear dynamics in economy and even the usefulness of those concepts has been questioned. Stochastic modeling has proven to be able to simulate reality fairly well. However, a stochastic behavior implies that reality is about exogenous randomness, while a chaotic behavior means that reality is deterministic and non-linearities are endogenous. Here we compare an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process with a Kaldor-Kalecki deterministic chaotic model to understand which one fits better real data. We show that our chaotic model is able to represent reality as well as the stochastic model taken into consideration.

However, whether HRV is causally related to the development of wheezing or HRV-associated wheeze is merely an indicator of disease susceptibility is unclear. Our aim was to study the role of HRV during infancy in the development of lower respiratory disease during infancy and childhood. METHODS In a population-based birth cohort, during the 1st year of life, nose and throat swabs were collected on a monthly basis, regardless of any symptoms. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect an extensive panel of respiratory pathogens. Lung function was measured before 2 months of age. Information on respiratory symptoms was collected by daily questionnaires and electronic patient files. RESULTS 1425 samples were collected in 140 infants. Both the presence of (single or multiple) pathogens (HRV equal to other pathogens) and increased respiratory system resistance were significantly associated with lower respiratory symptoms during infancy. HRV presence during infancy was not associated with the risk of wheezing at age 4, but every HRV episode with wheezing increased the risk of wheezing at age 4 (odds ratio 1.9, 1.1-3.5). This association weakened after adjustment for lung function (odds ratio 1.4, 0.7-2.9). CONCLUSIONS HRV and other viruses are associated with lower respiratory symptoms during infancy, as well as a high presymptomatic respiratory system resistance. HRV presence during infancy is not associated with childhood wheezing, but wheeze during a HRV episode is an indicator of children at high risk for childhood wheeze, partly because of a reduced neonatal lung function.","van der Gugten, Anne C; van der Zalm, Marieke M; Uiterwaal, Cuno S P M; Wilbrink, Berry; Rossen, John W A; van der Ent, Cornelis K",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,157,16

The primary aim of this review was to synthesise evidence of relationships between SDH and the frequency or severity of CLBP. Secondary aims were to identify relationships between SDH and LBP-related disability, work absenteeism, and opioid prescription. We included studies involving adult participants that evaluated relationships between one or more of the SDH and CLBP frequency or LBP outcomes (beyond 3 months). Two reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We synthesized the results narratively and applied PROGRESS to organise our findings. Database searches identified 7018 records. Forty-one studies were included, containing data from 2,161,617 adults from 17 countries. Twenty-four percent and 19% of the relationships included were classified as having a high risk of bias due to confounding and missing data, respectively.

METHODS Patients undergoing deep inferior epigastric perforator or transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap breast reconstructions at two academic centers from January of 2005 through January of 2011 were included. Thromboprophylaxis measures included early ambulation, low-molecular-weight heparin, elastic stockings, A-V Impulse System foot pumps, and pneumatic stockings. Risk factors for symptomatic pulmonary embolism were analyzed and weights were assigned to these risk factors. Sensitivity and specificity were maximized using receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS Of 430 consecutive patients, symptomatic pulmonary embolism occurred in 17 cases (4.0 percent). Two independent predictors for symptomatic pulmonary embolism were found, body mass index higher than 25, additionally higher than 28, and the BRCA gene mutation. Operation duration and bilaterality of reconstructions were dependent on the BRCA mutation and both indirect predictors for symptomatic pulmonary embolism. Optimization of sensitivity and specificity resulted in a prediction model. No significant differences in efficacy were found between the different thromboprophylaxis measures. CONCLUSIONS The rate of symptomatic pulmonary embolism was 4.0 percent, despite standard thromboprophylaxis. Body mass index and BRCA were significant predictors for symptomatic pulmonary embolism. The authors integrated these factors into a prediction model, which provides a useful tool for identification of high-risk patients. This latter category may benefit from a more aggressive thromboprophylaxis approach.

ScO2 readings are based on the fraction of reduced and oxidized hemoglobin as an indirect estimate of brain tissue oxygenation and assume a static ratio of arterial to venous intracranial blood. Conditions that alter cerebral blood flow, such as acute changes in PaCO2, may decrease accuracy. We assessed the performance of two commercial cerebral oximeters across a range of oxygen concentrations during normocapnia and hypocapnia. METHODS Casmed FORE-SIGHT Elite (CAS Medical Systems, Inc., USA) and Covidien INVOS 5100C (Covidien, USA) oximeter sensors were placed on 12 healthy volunteers. The fractional inspired oxygen tension was varied to achieve seven steady-state levels including hypoxic and hyperoxic PaO2 values. ScO2 and simultaneous arterial and jugular venous blood gas measurements were obtained with both normocapnia and hypocapnia. Oximeter bias was calculated as the difference between the ScO2 and reference saturation using manufacturer-specified weighting ratios from the arterial and venous samples. RESULTS FORE-SIGHT Elite bias was greater during hypocapnia as compared with normocapnia (4 ± 9% vs. 0 ± 6%; P < 0.001). The INVOS 5100C bias was also lower during normocapnia (5 ± 15% vs. 3 ± 12%; P = 0.01). Hypocapnia resulted in a significant decrease in mixed venous oxygen saturation and mixed venous oxygen tension, as well as increased oxygen extraction across fractional inspired oxygen tension levels (P < 0.0001). Bias increased significantly with increasing oxygen extraction (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Changes in PaCO2 affect cerebral oximeter accuracy, and increased bias occurs with hypocapnia. Decreased accuracy may represent an incorrect assumption of a static arterial-venous blood fraction. Understanding cerebral oximetry limitations is especially important in patients at risk for hypoxia-induced brain injury, where PaCO2 may be purposefully altered.","Schober, Andrew; Feiner, John R; Bickler, Philip E; Rollins, Mark D",Anesthesiology,157,1

METHODS A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study collecting demographic and mental health data from 2166 participants living in the Arab Gulf region (568 with diabetes, 1598 without diabetes). Depression and anxiety were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, respectively. RESULTS The prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms were 61% and 45%, in people with diabetes (PWD) and 62% and 44%, respectively, in people without diabetes. PWD who have had their diabetes visit cancelled by the clinic were more likely to report depression and anxiety symptoms than those without diabetes [OR (95% CI): 1.37 (1.02, 1.84) and 1.37 (1.04, 1.80), for depression and anxiety; respectively]. PWD who had no method of telecommunication with their health care providers (HCP) during the pandemic, PWD with A1C of ≥ 10%, women, employees (particularly HCPs), students, unmarried individuals, and those with lower income were more likely to report depression and/or anxiety symptoms (all p<0.01). Fear of acquiring the coronavirus infection; running out of diabetes medications; or requiring hospitalization for hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis; and lack of telecommunication with HCPs were all associated with significantly higher odds of having depression and anxiety symptoms among PWD. CONCLUSIONS The remarkably high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among subgroups of PWD, calls for urgent public health policies to address mental health during the pandemic and re-establish health care access for PWD.","Al-Sofiani, Mohammed E; Albunyan, Sarah; Alguwaihes, Abdullah M; Kalyani, Rita R; Golden, Sherita Hill; Alfadda, Assim",Journal of diabetes,157,1

The purpose of this study was to compare the clinicopathological outcomes between single-incision laparoscopic right colectomy (SILC) and multiport laparoscopic right colectomy (MLC) for right colon cancer. METHODS Thirty-five consecutive patients undergoing SILC from a prospective single-institution database were case matched according to demographic data to an equivalent number of patients who underwent MLC. RESULTS The SILC patients had decreased scores for maximal pain assessed by a visual analog scale on postoperative days 1 and 3, and used fewer postoperative systemic narcotics. The median length of the hospital stay for the SILC patients was significantly shorter compared with the MLC patients. The postoperative morbidity rates were similar between the groups. The oncological findings were not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSION SILC is a feasible and safe alternative to conventional MLC for patients with right colon cancer.","Suzuki, On; Nakamura, Fumitaka; Kashimura, Nobuichi; Nakamura, Toru; Takada, Minoru; Ambo, Yoshiyasu",Surgery today,157,1

Examining the relationship between fasting status, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) with circulating BCAA levels may provide insights into their metabolic handling. METHODS We conducted cross-sectional analyses among 25,740 Women's Health Study participants (mean age 55 years). RESULTS In multivariable linear regression models, fasting was associated with lower plasma BCAAs vs. non-fasting in women without metabolic syndrome or T2D (% mean difference=-5.1%; 95% CI=-5.8, -4.5) and among women with metabolic syndrome only (-3.7%; -4.9, -2.6), pinteraction=0.002. However, there was no difference in BCAAs by fasting status among women with T2D (0.4%; -3.7, 4.7). CONCLUSIONS We observed higher BCAAs with worsening metabolic health status. Fasting is modestly associated with lower plasma BCAAs, except among women with T2D. These findings support hypotheses that impaired BCAA catabolism may be a feature of T2D pathophysiology.","Tobias, Deirdre K; Mora, Samia; Verma, Subodh; Billia, Filio; Buring, Julie E; Lawler, Patrick R",Metabolism: clinical and experimental,157,4

Its hydration efficacy has not been examined. The beverage hydration index (BHI) has been used to compare various beverages to water in terms of post-ingestion fluid balance and retention. Our purpose was to compare the BHI (and related physiological responses) of a novel milk permeate solution (MPS) to that of water and a traditional carbohydrate-electrolyte solution (CES). Over three visits, 12 young subjects consumed 1 L of water, CES, or MPS. Urine samples were collected immediately post-ingestion and at 60, 120, 180, and 240 min. BHI was calculated by dividing cumulative urine output after water consumption by cumulative urine output for each test beverage at each time point. The BHI for MPS was significantly higher at all time points compared to water (all p < 0.001) and CES (all p ≤ 0.01) but did not differ between CES and water at any time point. Drinking 1 L of MPS resulted in decreased cumulative urine output across the subsequent 4 h compared to water and CES, suggesting that a beverage containing milk permeate is superior to water and a traditional CES at sustaining positive fluid balance post-ingestion.","Berry, Craig W; Wolf, S Tony; Murray, Bob; Kenney, W Larry",Nutrients,157,17

The synaptic mechanisms underlying this variability are poorly understood. We show that synaptic noise, in conjunction with weak feedforward excitation, generates variable motor output in the Aplysia feeding system. A command-like neuron (CBI-10) triggers rhythmic motor programs more variable than programs triggered by CBI-2. CBI-10 weakly excites a pivotal pattern-generating interneuron (B34) strongly activated by CBI-2. The activation properties of B34 substantially account for the degree of program variability. CBI-10- and CBI-2-induced EPSPs in B34 vary in amplitude across trials, suggesting that there is synaptic noise. Computational studies show that synaptic noise is required for program variability. Further, at network state transition points when synaptic conductance is low, maximum program variability is promoted by moderate noise levels. Thus, synaptic strength and noise act together in a nonlinear manner to determine the degree of variability within a feedforward network.","Zhang, Guo; Yu, Ke; Wang, Tao; Chen, Ting-Ting; Yuan, Wang-Ding; Yang, Fan; Le, Zi-Wei; Guo, Shi-Qi; Xue, Ying-Yu; Chen, Song-An; Yang, Zhe; Liu, Feng; Cropper, Elizabeth C; Weiss, Klaudiusz R; Jing, Jian",Science advances,157,29

Transmission rates following primary maternal infection occur at rates of 30-40%, however reported placental rates upon non-primary maternal infection is reported to be less than <4%. There is significant debate about whether this reduction in transmission rate is due to pre-existing maternal immunity, which could identify possible immunologic targets for vaccines. To address this question, we performed a systemic review of the literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. We identified cohort studies in high CMV seroprevalent (>80%) areas or in developing regions that examined a cohort of at least 50 infants for congenital CMV acquisition. We identified 19 articles that met criteria and were further categorized based on pre-conception serology, maternal seroprevalence, or previously known seroprevalence. Birth prevalence rates ranged from 0.4% to 6% (median 1.1%), with the studies reporting on clinical outcome (16/19 studies) noting the majority of infected infants as asymptomatic. We also utilized a recent study that differentiated primary maternal infections from chronic infections in a highly seropositive population to calculate a placental transmission rate in women with pre-existing immunity compared to that of no pre-existing immunity. This work confirms a low cCMV birth prevalence in highly seropositive populations, indicates via a calculated placental transmission rate that the CMV placental transmission rate is lower in non-primary infection than that of primary infection, and reveals gaps in data for further research aiming to identify targets for vaccine development.","Coppola, Tiziana; Mangold, Jesse F; Cantrell, Sarah; Permar, Sallie R",Vaccines,157,17

METHOD Medical records of 2257 patients who underwent RD surgery at this clinic between 2008 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 61 patients who were diagnosed as AD were assigned into the experimental group and 100 patients who did not have AD were randomly selected and assigned into the control group. Demographics, characteristics of detachment, initial operative method, and prognosis after surgery were investigated as main outcomes. Additionally, in pseudophakic RD patients, the period between the cataract surgery and onset of RD was measured. RESULT Postoperative VA and prognosis were significantly worse and bilateral involvement of RD was more common in the atopy group than in the control group. (P value = 0.005, 0.001 each) Characteristics of retinal breaks were different between the two groups. Additionally, the risk of developing RD within 1 year after cataract surgery was significantly higher in pseudophakic patients of the atopic group than in the control group. (P value = 0.013) However, there was no significant difference in mean preoperative VA or refractive index between the two groups. CONCLUSION Our results show that in atopic patients, RD occurs at a young age with different characteristics compared to non-atopic patients. Atopic RD has a poor visual prognosis. Thus, it requires careful management. Furthermore, the risk of developing RD within 1 year after cataract surgery is higher in atopic patients. Therefore, it is important to perform regular and extensive check-up after cataract surgery for atopic patients.","Lee, Youlim; Park, Woo Kyung; Kim, Rae-Young; Kim, Mirinae; Park, Young-Gun; Park, Young-Hoon",BMC ophthalmology,157,16

This study presents genetic data for 109 Arctic marine forest species (seaweeds), which revealed contiguous populations extending from the Bering Sea to the northwest Atlantic, with high levels of genetic diversity in the east Canadian Arctic. One-fifth of the species sampled appeared restricted to Arctic waters. Further supported by hindcasted species distributions during the Last Glacial Maximum, we hypothesize that Arctic coastal systems were recolonized from many geographically disparate refugia leading to enriched diversity levels in the east Canadian Arctic, with important contributions stemming from northerly refugia likely centered along southern Greenland. Our results suggest Arctic marine biomes persisted through cycles of glaciation, leading to unique assemblages in polar waters, rather than being entirely derived from southerly (temperate) areas following glaciation. As such, Arctic marine species are potentially born from selective pressures during Cenozoic global cooling and eventual ice conditions beginning in the Pleistocene. Arctic endemic diversity was likely additionally driven by repeated isolations into globally disparate refugia during glaciation. This study highlights the need to take stock of unique Arctic marine biodiversity. Amplification of warming and loss of perennial ice cover are set to dramatically alter available Arctic coastal habitat, with the potential loss of diversity and decline in ecosystem resilience.","Bringloe, Trevor T; Verbruggen, Heroen; Saunders, Gary W",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,157,8

Although men are primarily detected to be slightly more vulnerable in succumbing to the ongoing COVID-19 contagion, many researchers have recognized that women are facing more of the devastating brunt in secondary terms. Aside gendered health and social impacts, women are more disproportionately disadvantaged than men in economic terms, as they are predominantly found in the part-time and informal occupations, which have been closed down for months now since the emergence of the current global crisis. Also, since women form the vast proportion of the caregivers within the health sector, their role in handling the pandemic as frontline respondents at the hospitals put them in higher risks of contracting the disease. Despite this higher risk of infection, the peculiar attentions to women's health in the planning and rolling out of actions to contain the virus have been overlooked. Additionally, their unpaid domestic care works have also increased due to closure of schools and businesses, which have forced family members to stay at home for as long as movement control orders remain in place. In this confined state, the domestic violence against women have been recorded to be on the increase. To recommend measures that consider gendered dimensions of the current crisis, we have reviewed the various sex-based burdens and impacts of the pandemic, and proceeded to suggest necessary response actions to handle the situation. Particular emphasis is placed on the effects of the outbreak on women, and how the gendered flaws in the current response strategies could be avoided in managing future global crises.","Ayittey, Foster Kofi; Dhar, Bablu Kumar; Anani, Gideon; Chiwero, Nyasha Bennita",Health care for women international,157,26

We detected various viral genome replication levels in FMDV-infected cells. Large cells and cells with a high number of inclusions generated more viral RNA copies and viral protein and a higher proportion of infectious cells than other cells. Additionally, we found that the viral titer was 10- to 100-fold higher in cells in G2/M than those in other cell cycle phases and identified a strong correlation between cell size, inclusion, and cell cycle heterogeneity, which all affected the infection and replication of FMDV.

The historical emphasis on psychological and physiologic dysfunction after potentially traumatic events has suggested that such events almost always produce lasting emotional damage. Recent research, however, has consistently shown that across different types of potentially traumatic events, including bereavement, serious illness, and terrorist attack, upward of 50% of people have been found to display resilience. Research has further identified substantial individual variation in response to potentially traumatic events, including 4 prototypical and empirically derived outcome trajectories: chronic dysfunction, recovery, resilience, and delayed reactions. Factors that promote resilience are heterogeneous and include a variety of person-centered variables (eg, temperament of the child, personality, coping strategies), demographic variables (eg, male gender, older age, greater education), and sociocontextual factors (eg, supportive relations, community resources). It is surprising that some factors that promote resilience to potentially traumatic events may be maladaptive in other contexts, whereas other factors are more broadly adaptive. Given the growing evidence that resilience is common, psychotherapeutic treatment should be reserved for those in genuine need.","Bonanno, George A; Mancini, Anthony D",Pediatrics,157,29

In addition, there are at least four distinct mechanisms by which viral fusion proteins can be triggered to undergo fusion-inducing conformational changes. Viral fusion proteins also contain different types of fusion peptides and vary in their reliance on accessory proteins. These differing features combine to yield a rich diversity of fusion proteins. Yet despite this staggering diversity, all characterized viral fusion proteins convert from a fusion-competent state (dimers or trimers, depending on the class) to a membrane-embedded homotrimeric prehairpin, and then to a trimer-of-hairpins that brings the fusion peptide, attached to the target membrane, and the transmembrane domain, attached to the viral membrane, into close proximity thereby facilitating the union of viral and target membranes. During these conformational conversions, the fusion proteins induce membranes to progress through stages of close apposition, hemifusion, and then the formation of small, and finally large, fusion pores. Clearly, highly divergent proteins have converged on the same overall strategy to mediate fusion, an essential step in the life cycle of every enveloped virus.","White, Judith M; Delos, Sue E; Brecher, Matthew; Schornberg, Kathryn",Critical reviews in biochemistry and molecular biology,157,1

Migrant workers in India tend to live and work in megacities in crowded conditions that do not permit social distancing, putting them at an increased risk of contracting the disease. Migrant workers here face challenges accessing health care even in normal circumstances due to lack of health insurance, cost, administrative hurdles, lack of public health infrastructure, and lack of access to these facilities. The sudden lockdown due to Covid left lakhs of migrant workers in India stranded and on the road, having lost jobs and being left without income, food, and accommodation. Lakhs attempted to travel back home on foot only to be shuttled into shelters and relief camps hastily cobbled up as a last-minute response to the migrant crisis. This article analyzes the specific ways in which Indian migrant workers have been affected by the pandemic and examines the response of the government and its impact in mitigating and addressing the crisis.

Apart from the neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV-2, it is likewise important the observation that virus infection may perturb specific cellular processes that are believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of diverse neurological disorders, particularly in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this scenario, viral infection-induced colon inflammation, gut microbial imbalance, and α-synuclein upregulation are of particular interest with regard to the interplay between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system (microbiome-gut-brain axis). In this Perspective, we present a critical view on the different hypotheses that are recently being raised by neuroscientists about the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and long-lasting neurodegenerative disorders, opening the question of whether COVID-19 might represent a risk factor for the development of PD.","Follmer, Cristian",ACS chemical neuroscience,157,1

However, because it is a predictive methodology, GS strongly depends on statistical and machine learning to perform these predictions. For continuous outcomes, more models are available for GS. Unfortunately, for count data outcomes, there are few efficient statistical machine learning models for large datasets or for datasets with fewer observations than independent variables. For this reason, in this paper, we applied the univariate version of the Poisson deep neural network (PDNN) proposed earlier for genomic predictions of count data. The model was implemented with (a) the negative log-likelihood of Poisson distribution as the loss function, (b) the rectified linear activation unit as the activation function in hidden layers, and (c) the exponential activation function in the output layer. The advantage of the PDNN model is that it captures complex patterns in the data by implementing many nonlinear transformations in the hidden layers. Moreover, since it was implemented in Tensorflow as the back-end, and in Keras as the front-end, the model can be applied to moderate and large datasets, which is a significant advantage over previous GS models for count data. The PDNN model was compared with deep learning models with continuous outcomes, conventional generalized Poisson regression models, and conventional Bayesian regression methods. We found that the PDNN model outperformed the Bayesian regression and generalized Poisson regression methods in terms of prediction accuracy, although it was not better than the conventional deep neural network with continuous outcomes.","Montesinos-Lopez, Osval A; Montesinos-Lopez, Jose C; Salazar, Eduardo; Barron, Jose Alberto; Montesinos-Lopez, Abelardo; Buenrostro-Mariscal, Raymundo; Crossa, Jose",The plant genome,157,0

Since its identification, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been linked to more than 1372 infections manifesting with severe morbidity and, often, mortality (about 495 deaths) in the Arabian Peninsula, Europe, and, most recently, the United States. Human-to-human transmission has been documented, with nosocomial transmission appearing to be an important route of infection. The recent increase in cases of MERS in the Middle East coupled with the lack of approved antiviral therapies or vaccines to treat or prevent this infection are causes for concern. We report on the development of a synthetic DNA vaccine against MERS-CoV. An optimized DNA vaccine encoding the MERS spike protein induced potent cellular immunity and antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, macaques, and camels. Vaccinated rhesus macaques seroconverted rapidly and exhibited high levels of virus-neutralizing activity. Upon MERS viral challenge, all of the monkeys in the control-vaccinated group developed characteristic disease, including pneumonia. Vaccinated macaques were protected and failed to demonstrate any clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia. These studies demonstrate that a consensus MERS spike protein synthetic DNA vaccine can induce protective responses against viral challenge, indicating that this strategy may have value as a possible vaccine modality against this emerging pathogen.","Muthumani, Karuppiah; Falzarano, Darryl; Reuschel, Emma L; Tingey, Colleen; Flingai, Seleeke; Villarreal, Daniel O; Wise, Megan; Patel, Ami; Izmirly, Abdullah; Aljuaid, Abdulelah; Seliga, Alecia M; Soule, Geoff; Morrow, Matthew; Kraynyak, Kimberly A; Khan, Amir S; Scott, Dana P; Feldmann, Friederike; LaCasse, Rachel; Meade-White, Kimberly; Okumura, Atsushi; Ugen, Kenneth E; Sardesai, Niranjan Y; Kim, J Joseph; Kobinger, Gary; Feldmann, Heinz; Weiner, David B",Science translational medicine,157,1

For wildlife populations, disease-induced mortality is likely even greater, but remains notoriously difficult to estimate - especially for endemic infections. Approaches for quantifying wildlife mortality due to endemic infections have historically been limited by an inability to directly observe wildlife mortality in nature. Here, we address a question that can rarely be answered for endemic pathogens of wildlife: what are the population- and landscape-level effects of infection on host mortality? We combined laboratory experiments, extensive field data, and novel mathematical models to indirectly estimate the magnitude of mortality induced by an endemic, virulent trematode parasite (Ribeiroia ondatrae) on hundreds of amphibian populations spanning four native species. We developed a exible statistical model that uses patterns of aggregation in parasite abundance to infer host mortality. Our model improves on previous approaches for inferring host mortality from parasite abundance data by i.) relaxing restrictive assumptions on the timing of host mortality and sampling, ii.) placing all mortality inference within a Bayesian framework to better quantify uncertainty, and iii.) accommodating data from laboratory experiments and field sampling to allow for estimates and comparisons of mortality within and among host populations. Applying our approach to 301 amphibian populations, we found that trematode infection was associated with an average of between 13 and 40% population-level mortality. For three of the four amphibian species, our models predicted that some populations experienced >90% mortality due to infection, leading to mortality of thousands of amphibian larvae within a pond. At the landscape scale, the total number of amphibians predicted to succumb to infection was driven by a few high mortality sites, with fewer than 20% of sites contributing to greater than 80% of amphibian mortality on the landscape. The mortality estimates in this study provide a rare glimpse into the magnitude of effects that endemic parasites can have on wildlife populations and our theoretical framework for indirectly inferring parasite-induced mortality can be applied to other host-parasite systems to help reveal the hidden death toll of pathogens on wildlife hosts.","Wilber, Mark Q; Briggs, Cheryl J; Johnson, Pieter T J",The Journal of animal ecology,157,1

The majority of these lesions are benign but some progress to invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). There is a dearth of mouse models of these conditions. The orphan nuclear receptor NR5A2 regulates development, differentiation, and inflammation. Germline Nr5a2 heterozygosity sensitizes mice to the oncogenic effects of mutant Kras in the pancreas. Here, we show that - unlike constitutive Nr5a2+/- mice - conditional Nr5a2 heterozygosity in pancreatic epithelial cells, combined with mutant Kras, (KPN+/- ) leads to a dramatic replacement of the pancreatic parenchyma with cystic structures and an accelerated development of high grade PanINs and PDAC. Timed histopathological analyses indicated that in KPN+/- mice PanINs precede the formation of cystic lesions and the latter precede PDAC. A single episode of acute caerulein pancreatitis is sufficient to accelerate the development of cystic lesions in KPN+/- mice. Epithelial cells of cystic lesions of KPN+/- mice express MUC1, MUC5AC, and MUC6 but lack expression of MUC2, CDX2 and acinar markers, indicative of a pancreato-biliary/gastric phenotype. In accordance with this, in human samples we found a non-significantly decreased expression of NR5A2 in mucinous tumours, compared with conventional PDAC. These results highlight that the effects of loss of one Nr5a2 allele are time- and cell context-dependent. KPN+/- mice represent a new model to study the formation of cystic pancreatic lesions and their relationship with PanINs and classical PDAC. Our findings suggest that pancreatitis could also contribute to acceleration of cystic tumour progression in patients. This article is protected by copyright.

Chronic stress, such as the stress experienced by individuals suffering from burnout, has been shown to influence the amounts and types of foods individuals eat, contributing both to excessive eating and undereating and the development of chronic diseases. Dietary strategies to mitigate burnout for physicians and health care professionals should be developed based on existing evidence related to nutrition and mental health, incorporate effective behavior change theory, and include systems-level change to promote healthy eating among health care professionals. Evidence supports the application of the Mediterranean diet, cognitive behavioral theory, and mindful eating interventions.

Preliminary program efficacy outcomes are also described. METHODS Twenty-two families of children between the ages of 3-8 years with histories of neonatal stroke, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and serious congenital and neonatal conditions [(congenital heart disease (CHD) or prematurity)] consented to participate in an adapted telepsychological parenting skills training program (I-InTERACT-North). The program helps parents develop positive parenting skills to improve parenting competence and child behaviour through 7 online psychoeducational modules completed independently and 7 videoconference sessions with a therapist. Videoconference sessions include live coaching to support application of skills. Feasibility (i.e., number of participants eligible, consented, refused), adherence (i.e., completion time, retention rates), acceptability (i.e., website experience questionnaire, therapist and parent semi-structured interviews), and preliminary efficacy (i.e., observational coding of parenting skill, self-reported parent competence, parent-reported child behaviour) data were collected. RESULTS Nineteen of the 22 families (86%) enrolled completed the program in an average of 10 weeks (range: 6-17 weeks). Parents and therapists reported high overall satisfaction with the program (100%), including acceptability of both the online modules (95%) and the videoconference sessions (95%).

METHODS Sixty-nine patients who underwent PulLE (n = 34) or cVATS (n = 35) between January 2009 and December 2013 were enrolled in this study. PulLE was performed as follows. After making a 17- to 25-mm single incision in the 6th intercostal space (6ICS) at the median axillary line, the visceral pleura near the bulla was sutured for traction. The parietal pleura at 3ICS was then sutured from the thoracic cavity to serve as the chest wall pulley and a traction thread was passed through the pulley. By manipulating the traction thread, it was possible to move the lesion to an arbitrary site for excision. The postoperative scar was nearly invisible. RESULTS The operative time, duration of postoperative drainage, and postoperative hospital stay were equivalent for PulLE vs. cVATS. There was no significant difference in postoperative recurrence rates. CONCLUSIONS PulLE has cosmetic benefits over cVATS and is easy to perform.

Simulation training and practice of proper cast application and removal may reduce injury, optimize outcomes, and reduce health care costs. The purpose of this educational initiative was to develop, validate, and implement a novel simulation trainer and curriculum to improve safety during cast removal. METHODS In all, 30 thermocouples (Omega, Stamford, CT) were applied to a radius fracture model (Sawbones, Vashon, WA). After reduction and cast application, a saw (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI) was used to cut the cast with temperature recording. Both ""good"" and ""poor"" techniques-as established by consensus best practices-were used. Maximal temperatures were compared to known thresholds for thermal injury; humans experience pain at temperatures exceeding 47°C and contact temperatures exceeding 60°C may lead to epidermal necrosis. Construct validity was evaluated by assessing novice (postgraduate year 1), intermediate (postgraduate year 3), and expert (pediatric orthopedic attending) performance. RESULTS With the ""good"" technique, mean peak temperatures were 43°C + 4.3°C. The highest recorded was 51.9°C. With the ""poor"" technique, mean peak temperature was 75.2°C + 17.3°C. The maximum temperature recorded with the ""poor"" technique was 112.4°C. Construct validity testing showed that novices had the highest increases in temperatures (12.9°C). There was a decline in heat generation as experience increased with the intermediate group (9.7°C), and the lowest heat generation was seen in the expert group (5.0°C). CONCLUSIONS A novel task simulator and curriculum have been developed to assess competency and enhance performance in the application and removal of casts. There was a 32.2°C temperature decrease when the proper cast saw technique was used. Furthermore, the ""poor"" technique consistently achieved temperatures that would cause epidermal necrosis in patients. Clinical experience was a predictor of decreased heat generation during cast removal. This task trainer allows instruction and safety monitoring of the casting technique.","Brubacher, Jacob W; Karg, Jeffrey; Weinstock, Peter; Bae, Donald S",Journal of surgical education,157,1

However, laparoscopy is not easily applied to tumors near the esophagogastric junction (EGJ). This study was conducted to evaluate laparoscopic techniques for treating SMTs near the EGJ. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Between March 2008 and August 2012 at the Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, we performed laparoscopic surgery on 71 patients who had SMTs located within 3 cm of the EGJ. The laparoscopic approach chosen depended on the position of the tumor, which was located accurately by preoperative diagnosis. RESULTS None of the patients required conversion to open surgery. Of the 71 patients in the study, 66 had laparoscopic wedge resection (LAPWR), 4 had laparoscopic enucleation, and 1 had laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy. Two patients had intraoperative events during LAPWR. One had EGJ stricture, which required laparoscopic esophagogastrostomy. The other had a muscle defect of the posterior wall of the distal esophagus, and the defect was covered using fundus-like fundoplication. All patients had tumor-free resection margins, and there were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic resection of SMTs near the EGJ may be performed safely. The laparoscopic approach used depends on the location and size of the tumor and on the extent of gastric resection.","Kim, Hee Sung; Kim, Min Gyu; Kim, Beom Su; Lee, In Seob; Lee, Sol; Yook, Jeoung Hwan; Kim, Byung Sik",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

We report the development of a comprehensive solution to produce (99m)Tc in sufficient quantities to supply a large urban area using a single medical cyclotron. METHODS A new target system was designed for (99m)Tc production. Target plates made of tantalum were coated with a layer of (100)Mo by electrophoretic deposition followed by high-temperature sintering. The targets were irradiated with 18-MeV protons for up to 6 h, using a medical cyclotron. The targets were automatically retrieved and dissolved in 30% H2O2. (99m)Tc was purified by solid-phase extraction or biphasic exchange chromatography. RESULTS Between 1.04 and 1.5 g of (100)Mo were deposited on the tantalum plates. After high-temperature sintering, the (100)Mo formed a hard, adherent layer that bonded well with the backing surface. The targets were irradiated for 1-6.9 h at 20-240 μA of proton beam current, producing up to 348 GBq (9.4 Ci) of (99m)Tc. The resulting pertechnetate passed all standard quality control procedures and could be used to reconstitute typical anionic, cationic, and neutral technetium radiopharmaceutical kits. CONCLUSION The direct production of (99m)Tc via proton bombardment of (100)Mo can be practically achieved in high yields using conventional medical cyclotrons.

Smell impairment affects physical and mental health, and dietary behavior. Thus, it is critical to understand the rate and time course of smell recovery. Objective: To characterize smell function and recovery up to 11 months post COVID-19 infection. Settings, Participants: This longitudinal survey of individuals suffering COVID-19-related smell loss assessed disease symptoms and gustatory and olfactory function. Participants (n=12,313) who completed an initial respiratory symptoms, chemosensory function, and COVID-19 diagnosis survey (S1) between April and September 2020 and completed a follow-up survey (S2) between September 2020 and February 2021; 27.5% participants responded (n=3,386), with 1,468 being diagnosed with COVID-19 and suffering co-occurring smell and taste loss at the beginning of their illness. Main Outcomes & Measures: Primary outcomes are ratings of smell and taste function on a visual analog scale, and self-report of parosmia (smell distortions) and phantosmia (unexplained smells). Secondary outcomes include a checklist of other COVID-19 symptoms. Results: On follow-up (median time since COVID-19 onset ~200 days), ~60% of women and ~48% of men reported less than 80% of their pre-illness smell ability. Taste typically recovered faster than smell, and taste loss rarely persisted if smell recovered. Prevalence of parosmia and phantosmia was ~10% of participants in S1 and increased substantially in S2: ~47% for parosmia and ~25% for phantosmia. Persistent smell impairment was associated with more symptoms overall, suggesting it may be a key marker of long-COVID. During COVID-19 illness, the ability to smell was slightly lower among those who did not recover their pre-illness ability to smell at S2. Conclusions and Relevance: While smell loss improves for many individuals who lost it due to COVID-19, the prevalence of parosmia and phantosmia increases substantially over time. Olfactory dysfunction is also associated with wider COVID-19 symptoms and may persist for many months after COVID-19 onset. Taste loss in the absence of smell loss is rare. Persistent qualitative smell symptoms are emerging as common long-term sequelae; more research into treatment options is strongly warranted given that conservative estimates suggest millions of individuals may experience parosmia following COVID-19. Healthcare providers worldwide need to be prepared to treat post COVID-19 secondary effects on physical and mental health.","Ohla, K.; Veldhuizen, M. G.; Green, T.; Hannum, M. E.; Bakke, A.

Yet, reliable SV prevalence rates and risk factors are lacking, due to methodological shortcomings in current studies. SV research involves challenges regarding safety and disclosure, especially in older adults. In this paper we reflect on the methods used in a SH&V study in older adults balancing between GDPR imposed privacy rules and ethical and safety guidelines. Methods: To ensure the acceptability of the questionnaire, it was tested in a two-phase pilot study. To maximise SV disclosure, the questionnaire built up gradually towards the more sensitive SV modules. Interviewers were trained to approach participants in a non-judgemental manner. Due to GDPR, our data collection method was changed from a random sampling via the National Register to a cluster random probability sampling with a random route finding approach. Results: Older adults were willing to discuss SH&V during a face-to-face interview with trained interviewers. Following strict safety guidelines, no major incidents were reported. The cluster random probability sampling with random route finding approach provided an adequate sampling frame, but was inefficient and time-consuming. Conclusion: Doing research on SH&V in older adults is feasible, but requires a substantial investment of time and the challenges involved may incur greater costs. Research institutions, donors, and policy makers should convene to investigate how problems related to GDPR can be solved, especially regarding research on sensitive topics and hard to reach populations.","Nobels, A.; Inescu, A.

The SCS aims to regulate societal behavior by reputational and material devices. Scholarship on the SCS has offered a variety of legal and theoretical perspectives. However, little is known about its actual implementation. Here, we provide the first comprehensive empirical study of digital blacklists (listing ""bad""behavior) and redlists (listing ""good""behavior) in the Chinese SCS. Based on a unique data set of reputational blacklists and redlists in 30 Chinese provincial-level administrative divisions (ADs), we show the diversity, flexibility, and comprehensiveness of the SCS listing infrastructure. First, our results demonstrate that the Chinese SCS unfolds in a highly diversified manner: we find differences in accessibility, interface design and credit information across provincial-level SCS blacklists and redlists. Second, SCS listings are flexible. During the COVID-19 outbreak, we observe a swift addition of blacklists and redlists that helps strengthen the compliance with coronavirus-related norms and regulations. Third, the SCS listing infrastructure is comprehensive. Overall, we identify 273 blacklists and 154 redlists across provincial-level ADs. Our blacklist and redlist taxonomy highlights that the SCS listing infrastructure prioritizes law enforcement and industry regulations. We also identify redlists that reward political and moral behavior. Our study substantiates the enormous scale and diversity of the Chinese SCS and puts the debate on its reach and societal impact on firmer ground. Finally, we initiate a discussion on the ethical dimensions of data-driven research on the SCS. © 2021 ACM.","Engelmann, S.; Chen, M.; Dang, L.; Grossklags, J.","4th AAAI/ACM Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Ethics, and Society, AIES 2021",157,1

We hypothesise that the PENG block is safe and effective for patients with hip fracture when provided by emergency physicians and trainees in the emergency department (ED), for which it may be superior to fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) and femoral nerve block (FNB). Methods From October 2019 to July 2020, consecutive patients receiving regional anaesthesia for hip fracture in the ED of a single large regional hospital were prospectively enrolled. Pain scores were assessed prior to regional anaesthesia then at 15, 30 and 60 minutes after regional anaesthesia. Maximal reduction in pain scores within 60 minutes were assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (at rest and on movement) or the Pain Assessment IN Advanced Dementia tool (at rest). Patients were followed for opioid use for 12 hours after regional anaesthesia and adverse events over the duration of their admission. Results There were 67 eligible patients during the enrolment period, with 52 (78%) prospectively enrolled. Thirty-three received femoral blocks (19 FICB, 14 FNB) and 19 received a PENG block. There was no difference in maximum pain score reduction between the groups whether measured at rest or on movement. Clinicians providing the PENG block were less experienced in the technique than those providing FICB or FNB. There was no difference in adverse effects between groups. Although opioid use was similar between the groups, more patients were opioid free after a PENG block. Conclusions Although there was no difference in maximal pain score reduction, this study demonstrated that the PENG block was feasible and could be provided safely and effectively to patients with hip fracture in the ED. On this basis, a larger randomised controlled study should now be designed.","Fahey, A.; Cripps, E.; Ng, A.; Sweeny, A.; Snelling, P.",,157,11

At that time, it was unspeakable how this infection would occur in children with RB in compare to adults. Now it's time to draw preliminary conclusions. Objectives: to analyze all features of COVID19 infection in children with RD Methods: The retrospective single center study of all patients with pediatric RD who had the COVID19 infection up to the end of January 2021. It was analyzed all variety of clinical manifestations, changing in therapy at the time of COVID-19 and after it, the dynamics of the RD and consequences of the new viral disease. Results: The study included 66 patients under the age of 18 with various RS, including autoinflammatory disease (AIDs). The diagnostic distribution, sex ratio, age and previous therapy present in the Table 1. There were patients treated with DMARDS (methotrexate -47, hydroxychloroquine -3, mycophenolate mofetil -2, colchicine -1), NSAID monotherapy -6, systemic steroids -10;29 patients recived Biologics, including combination with methotrexate. None of our patients had a severe course of the COVID-19, none of 66 patients was hospitalized for emergency indications in the intensive care unit or in other specialized departments. The diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was based on different evidences: positive PCR in 15 (23%) cases, high levels of immunoglobulins G and M -in 64 (97%) and 7 (11%) respectively, viral pneumonia was confirmed by CT in 2 (10%) cases. A manifest clinical picture presented just in 21 (32 %) of patients, the others were carried the disease asymptomatically. Among the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 that were observed in our patients were the following: fever, as the most frequent symptom -19 (90%), rhinitis -12 (57%), anosmia -10 (48%), sore throat -3 (14%), arthralgia/myalgia in 4 (19%), rash -1 (5%) case, cough -4 (19%) cases. it is important to note that until July 2020, only 4 patients were registered, and in the next 6 months -62. The treatment against COVID-19 in our patients with clinical symptoms included: NSAID monotherapy -4 (19%), Systemic steroids -2 (10%), Hydroxychloroquine -2(10%), Antibiotics-5 (24%).Conclusion: Our study suggests that the presence of RD and immunosuppression therapy does not lead to an increased frequency or severe course of COVID-19 infection in children.

The paper analyzes the sustainability of the e-learning system implemented in Romania during the pandemic, and it is based on an opinion poll based on a questionnaire developed on three levels of schooling (middle school, high school, and university), analyzed from three perspectives, teachers–students–parents, and identifying the possible psychological effects on students, resulting from the corroboration of social isolation with the online continuation of the educational process. Although before the pandemic the e-learning system was rarely used by both students and teachers, the research results indicate that students have accepted online learning, even if they find it less attractive than the traditional education system. From the teacher–student–parent perspective, e-learning is an effective sustainable learning solution in current and future conditions, but it requires good collaboration between parents and teachers, careful monitoring of children’s/students’ behavior to identify and combat possible effects determined by the changing way of learning and of social realities.","Constantin Aurelian, Ionescu Paschia Liliana Nicoleta Luminita Gudanescu Nicolau Stanescu Sorina Geanina Veronica Maria Neacsu Stancescu Coman Mihaela Denisa Uzlau Marilena Carmen",Sustainability,157,13

Immunogenicity and safety profiles of homologous two-dose schedules have been published. We report interim results of immune persistence, and the immunogenicity and safety of a third dose of CoronaVac. Methods In this ongoing, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 2 trial in 18-to-59-year-olds, we randomly assigned subjects, 1:1:1:1, to one of four schedules to receive a third dose, 28 days or 6 months after two two-dose regimens (14-day or 28-day apart): schedule 1: days 0, 14, 42; schedule 2: days 0, 14, 194; schedule 3: days 0, 28, 56; schedule 4: days 0, 28, 208. For each schedule, participants were randomly assigned to either a medium-dose group (3 g per 0.5 mL of aluminum hydroxide diluent per dose), a high-dose group (6 g), or a placebo group (2:2:1). The primary outcome was geometric mean titers (GMTs) of neutralizing antibody to live SARS-CoV-2. Results Overall, 540 participants received a third dose. In the 3 g group, neutralizing antibody titers induced by the first two doses declined after 6-8 months to below the seropositive cutoff (GMT: 4.1 [95%CI 3.3-5.2] for Schedule 2 and 6.7 [95%CI 5.2-8.6] for Schedule 4). When a third dose was given 6-8 months after a second dose, GMTs assessed 14 days later increased to 137.9 [95%CI 99.9-190.4] for Schedule 2, and 143.1 [95%CI 110.8-184.7] for Schedule 4, approximately 3-fold above Schedule 1 and Schedule 3 GMTs after third doses. Similar patterns were observed for the 6 g group. The severity of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions reported within 28 days after the third dose were grade 1 to grade 2 in all vaccination cohorts. None of the fourteen serious adverse events were considered to be related to vaccination. Conclusions A third dose of CoronaVac administered 6 or more months after a second dose effectively recalled specific immune response to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a remarkable increase in antibody levels, and indicating that a two-dose schedule generates good immune memory. Optimizing the timing of a booster dose should take into account immunogenicity, vaccine efficacy/effectiveness, local epidemic situation, infection risk, and vaccine supply.

With this sanction, sudden changes occurred in a routine lifestyle. Objectives: This study aimed at evaluating physical activity changes, presence of anxiety and depression, altered eating habits and their relationship with disease activity in axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) patients during the quarantine period. Methods: AxSpA patients, who were examined in the rheumatology clinic in the last year before the pandemic period and their relatives were included in this study and were contacted by phone to participate. A structured questionnaire form was performed which included the following data: questions about demographic characteristics, medication use, disease activity scales;BASDAI, BASFI, Patient acceptable symptom state (PASS), patient-reported physical activity state, Short Questionnaire to Assess Health enhancing physical activity (SQUASH), Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-21), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADs). Results: 204 AxSpA patients and 106 patients' relatives were contacted in the study (Figure 1). The frequency of male sex and alcohol consumption was higher in the AxSpA compared to the relatives and, other demographic features were summarized in Table 1. 30% of AxSpA patients and 37% of patient relatives were gained weight with mean 4.5±2.4 and 4.4±3.4 kilograms, respectively. Weight gain were similar male and female in AxSpA (26.2% vs 37.2%, p≥0.05). However, the men in the AxSpA group gained more weight than relatives group (26.2% vs 7%, p<0.05). Weight gain group had decreased physical activity than stable group in AxSpA patients (54.8% vs 37.8%, p<0.05). We showed mild negative correlation between BASDAI and BASFI scores with SQUASH-total activity score (r:-0.15, p<0.05;r:-0.25, p<0.001, respectively). Anxiety prevalence were found slightly higher in patients group but not significantly (40.2% vs 32.1%;p≥0.05). Depression were much higher in AxSpA group than relatives (43.6% vs 28%, p<0.001). Depression and anxiety were correlated with disease activity (HADs Depression vs BASDAI r:0.380, p<0.001;HADs Anxiety vs BASDAI r:0.418, p<0.001) and function (HADs Depression vs BASFI r:0.342, p<0.001;HADs Anxiety vs BASFI r:0.313, p<0.001). Among eating habits, uncontrolled and emotional eating scores were showed low correlation with anxiety (r:0.169, p<0.05;r:0.163, p<0.05, respectively). Conclusion: One third of our patients were weight gain and approximately half of them had decreased physical activity but we did not show relation between these parameters and disease related factors in the limited period.

However, there is uncertainty about the duration of immunity, evolution of IgG antibody levels and IgG avidity (an index of antibody-antigen binding strength), and differences in the immune responses between vaccines. Here we performed a prospective pilot study of 71 previously COVID-19 free subjects upon receiving both doses of either the Pfizer (n = 54) or Moderna (n = 17) mRNA vaccine. Anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG antibodies were measured longitudinally using a qualitative finger stick MidaSpot rapid test at the point-of-care for initial screening and a quantitative dry blood spot-based pGOLD laboratory test over ~ four months post-vaccination. The average anti-RBD IgG antibody levels peaked at ~ two weeks after the second dose vaccine and declined thereafter, while antibody avidity increased, suggesting antibody maturation. Moderna vaccine recipients compared to Pfizer vaccine recipients exhibited higher side effect severity, higher peak anti-RBD IgG antibody levels, and higher avidity up to the 90 days period. Differences in antibody levels diminished at ~ 120 days post-vaccination, in line with the similar efficacy observed in the two vaccines. The MidaSpot rapid test detected 100% anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD positivity for fully vaccinated subjects in both Pfizer and Moderna cohorts post full vaccination but turned negative greater than 90 days post-vaccination for 5.4% of subjects in the Pfizer cohort, whose quantitative anti-IgG were near the minimum levels of the group. Immune responses were found to vary greatly among vaccinees.

We constructed an empirically-based model of serological detection rates to quantify COVID reporting rates in national and sub-national locations. From those reporting rates, we estimated relative COVID burden, finding results that contrast with estimates based on case counts and modeling. To investigate COVID mortality by age in an LMIC context, we utilized a unique morgue study of COVID in Lusaka alongside the population attributable fraction method to account for HIV comorbidity. We calculated the comorbidity-corrected age-adjusted mortality curve in Lusaka and found it significantly skewed toward younger age groups as compared to HICs. This unexpected result recommends against the unexamined use of HIC-derived parameterizations of COVID characteristics in LMIC settings, and challenges the hypothesis of an age-structure protective factor for COVID burden in Africa. Indeed, we found overall COVID burden to be higher in Lusaka than in HICs. Concurrent with high COVID burden, many LMICs have high prevalence of other public health issues such as HIV, which compete for limited health investment resources. Given differences in age-structure, comorbidities, and healthcare delivery costs, we provide a case study comparing the cost efficacy of investment in COVID versus HIV and found that even in a high HIV prevalence setting, investment in COVID remains cost-effective. As a whole, these analyses have broad implications for interpretations of COVID burden, modeling applications, and policy decision-making.","Van Gordon, M. M.; Mwananyanda, L.; Gill, C.

In order to explore the social distancing obedience behavior, a comprehensive survey was conducted in this study by collecting data from 1064 Chinese residents in January 2021 by means of a questionnaire. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and hierarchical linear regression (HLR) analyses were employed to investigate the research hypotheses considered, testing the three influencing factors of social distancing obedience behavior: public guidance, risk perception, and regulation punishment. The reliability and validity of the measurements are demonstrated. The outcomes from the conducted analyses show that the public guidance significantly affects risk perception of individuals, while risk perception imposes a positive impact on social distancing obedience behavior. Moreover, risk perception serves a mediating role in the relationship between the public guidance and social distancing obedience behavior. In addition, regulation punishment positively predicts social distancing obedience behavior and could even have a greater effect by enhancing risk perception. Hence, this study suggests that the relevant authorities and agencies implement strong social distancing policies during the COVID-19 post-pandemic period from the perspective of promoting the public guidance, risk perception, and regulation punishment.","Yuan, Jinghan Zou Hansong Xie Kefan Dulebenets Maxim A.",Sustainability,157,1

Given the recommendations to minimize face-to-face interactions, several helplines were widely developed.ObjectivesIn this work, we aim to reflect on the experience of a university helpline, that integrated efforts with the regional mental health care services.MethodsA University helpline was created to give support to the regional community outside academia. The team was created on an online teamwork platform, to communicate through the chat, carry videoconference meetings, and store useful files. A Manchester screening decision tree was adopted, to define a set of guidelines to provide support to the callers, based mainly on the guidelines defined by the Order of Portuguese Psychologists. Liaison with the mental health care services, including other specific helplines, was established.ResultsNotwithstanding all the efforts, the number of received calls was scarce, similarly to helplines created by other national universities and by other entities.ConclusionsA new approach to psychological intervention in crisis is needed, maintaining integrated efforts, and taking advantage of the opportunity to foster personalized mental health care in the digital era. It is important to continuously assess the value of integrated efforts in patient care and to the healthcare system.","Torres, A.; Santos, I.

Assessing the risk of severe course in patients with rheumatic diseases, especially those who receive targeted immunosuppressive treatment, is an urgent problem for rheumatologists. Objectives: determine the relationship between used targeted biologic and synthetic DMARDs (tDMARDs) and the severity of course of COVID-19 infection. Methods: The analysis included the data of patients with chronic arthritis and COVID-19, used tDMARDs. COVID-19 infection was confirm by serology tests or immune system molecules (immunoglobulins/antibodies). The presence of symptoms, the need for hospitalization, and the need for oxygen therapy were considered as indicators of the severity of the infection. We also analyzed the spread of the lung involvement according to CT data, symptoms during the disease (fever, cough, anosmia, diarrhea). Results: Analyses included 78 patients, among them 32 patients has ankylosing spondylitis, 31 patients -rheumatoid arthritis, 12 patients has psoriatic arthritis, 3 patients -juvenile arthritis. The average age of the included patients was 51,8 ± 11,69. Most of patients used TNF inhibitors -43 (Adalimumab -10, Golimumab -4, Infliximab -4, Certolizumab pegol -3, Etanercept -22), JAK inhibitor tofacitinib used 13 patients, 5 patients each was treated with Abatacept and Tocilizumab, 3 patients used Rituximab and 2 patients each used Netakimab and Ustekinumab (Table 1). None of the patients included in the analysis required treatment in the ICU and/or mechanical ventilation. The course of the disease in patients treated with tDMARDs did not seem to be more severe than in 5 patients with arthritis who stopped treatment with tDMARDs before the onset of the pandemic. There was a direct correlation between the severity of the infection and the age of the patients (p=0.007). There were no significant differences in the severity of the infection depending on the drug, including when adjusting for age. Conclusion: COVID-19 does not look extremely dangerous in patients with rheumatic diseases, used target DMARDs. Used of tsDMARDs doesn't reliably increase the risk of COVID-19 severity. There is reliable correlation between age and COVID-19 severity.","Koltsova, E.; Lukina, G.; Shmidt, E.; Lytkina, K.; Rozochkina, E.; Zhilyaev, E.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,157,27

Design: A cross sectional study. Setting: Data from 20 member nations of the WHO African region until September 1, 2020. Participants: 69,580 cases of COVID-19, stratified by sex (men, n=43071; women, n=26509) and age (0-39 years, n=41682; 40-59 years, n=20757; 60+ years, n=7141). Main outcome measures: We computed the SSA- and country-specific case fatality rates (CFRs) and sex-specific CFR differences across various age groups, using a Bayesian approach. Results: A total of 1,656 (2.4% of total cases reported; 1656/69580) deaths were reported, with men accounting for 1168/1656 (70.5%) of total deaths. In SSA, women had a lower CFR than men (mean CFR = -0.9%; 95% credible intervals -1.1% to -0.6%). The mean CFR estimates increased with age, with the sex-specific CFR differences being significant among those aged 40 or more (40-59 age-group: mean CFR = -0.7%; 95% credible intervals -1.1% to -0.2%; 60+ age-group: mean CFR = -3.9%; 95% credible intervals -5.3% to -2.4%). At the country level, seven of the twenty SSA countries reported significantly lower CFRs among women than men overall. Moreover, corresponding to the age-specific datasets, significantly lower CFRs in women than men were observed in the 60+ age-group in seven countries and 40-59 age-group in one country. Conclusions: Sex and age are important predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Countries should prioritize the collection and use of sex-disaggregated data to understand the evolution of the pandemic. This is essential to design public health interventions and ensure that policies promote a gender sensitive public health response.","Dalal, J.; Triulzi, I.; James, A.; Nguimbis, B.; Dri, G.

Limited case series involving critically ill patients have been reported from South East Asia. Methods: This is a single center, retrospective case series involving 49 ventilated critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to Hospital Sungai Buloh, Selangor, Malaysia admitted between 7th March until 16th April 2020. Inclusion criteria are COVID-19 adult patients age more than 12 years old, with history of intubation during their intensive care unit (ICU) stay and admitted between 7th March until 16th April. Data were obtained from electronic health record and ICU progress sheet. Results: Forty-nine ventilated COVID-19 patients were included {mean 60.2 [standard deviation (SD): 9.3], range: 42-79, male 75.5%}. Most common comorbidities were hypertension 30 (61%), diabetes 26 (53%) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) 8 (16%). Mean PaO2/FiO2 (PF) ratio on admission was 115 reflecting severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Fourteen (28.6%) patients required prone ventilation. Patients were intubated for an average of 10 (SD: 8.3) days. All patients received antiviral therapies. The more severely ill patients received either corticosteroid [dexamethasone 11 (22.4%), methylprednisolone 12 (24.5%)] or tocilizumab 8 (16.3%). During their illness, 32 (65.3%) patients developed acute kidney injury (AKI) with 23 (46.9%) patients needing renal replacement therapy (RRT). Average ICU stay is 18 (SD: 10.2) days.

As this remote work style has proliferated, new problems have come to light. One problem is that managers cannot fully grasp the engagement level of subordinates such as in terms of absorption, dedication, and vigor due to limited in-person communications. However, as a substitute for in-person communications, online communications via text-based chat tools such as Slack and Microsoft's Teams have become popular. Recognizing the level of work engagement in a remote work setting is difficult, so we propose a new approach that estimates this level using text-based chat tools. To evaluate the proposal, we conduct experiments using actual Slack data. The experimental results reveal that the content of the conversations do not influence the level of work engagement, but the frequency of conversations among the teams and team members does. Therefore, we develop a machine learning model that estimates the level of work engagement using only the frequency and affiliation as features. The model estimates the work engagement level using true and predicted values at a correlation coefficient of 0.72. Since the proposed model uses only the frequency and affiliation, it is valuable in actual business situations. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Tanaka, H.; Yamada, W.; Ochiai, K.",5th Asian CHI Symposium 2021,157,1

Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using web-based platforms among 471 health-care personnel's within a period of a month (December 2020–January 2021). The study was conducted after obtaining institution ethic committee approval and informed consent. The questionnaire contains sociodemographic detail, COVID profile section, and questions which reveal the beliefs and attitude toward vaccination particularly COVID-19. The data collected was entered in Microsoft Excel and analyzed using SPSS version 16 software. Results: Among the participants, 56 (11.9%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 119 (25.3%) were not willing to take vaccine. Participants who were hesitant about the role of vaccine in immunity, afraid of side effects, doubtful about effectiveness and protection and who doubt about the production involving cost and supply have showed unwillingness to vaccination (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: A quarter of the present study population showed unwillingness to take COVID vaccine, and evidence of uncertainty about the vaccine safety and production was exposed in the study.

It will be shown that the borrowing of these processes started with borrowing of English lexical material followed by a process of reinterpretation, which subsequently led to the (re-)introduction of the processes in Dutch.

We identified circular DNA across the genome of young S. cerevisiae populations and their aged descendants. Young cells had highly diverse circular DNA populations, but lost 94% of the different circular DNA after 20 divisions. Circles present in both young and old cells were characterized by replication origins and included circles from unique regions of the genome, rDNA circles and telomeric Y’ circles. The loss in genetic heterogeneity in aged cells was accompanied by massive accumulation of rDNA circles >95% of all circular DNA. We discovered circles had flexible inherence patterns. Glucose limited conditions selected for cells with glucose-transporter gene circles, [HXT6/7circle], and up to 50% of cells in a population carried them.

Changes in their composition across lymphoid organs are a consequence of B-cell selection and migration events leading to a highly dynamic and unique physiological landscape of antibody repertoires upon antigenic challenge (e.g., vaccination). However, to what extent B cells encoding identical or similar antibody sequences (clones) are distributed across multiple lymphoid organs and how this is shaped by the strength of a humoral response, remains largely unexplored. Here, we performed an in-depth systems analysis of antibody repertoires across multiple distinct lymphoid organs of immunized mice, and discovered that organ-specific antibody repertoire features (e.g., germline V-gene usage and clonal expansion profiles) equilibrated upon a strong humoral response (multiple immunizations and high serum titers). This resulted in a surprisingly high degree of repertoire consolidation, characterized by highly connected and overlapping B-cell clones across multiple lymphoid organs. Finally, we revealed distinct physiological axes indicating clonal migrations and showed that antibody repertoire consolidation directly correlated with antigen-specificity. Our study uncovered how a strong humoral response resulted in a more uniform but redundant physiological landscape of antibody repertoires, indicating that increases in antibody serum titers were a result of synergistic contributions from antigen-specific B-cell clones distributed across multiple lymphoid organs. Our findings provide valuable insights for the assessment and design of vaccine strategies.","Csepregi, Lucia; Hoehn, Kenneth B.; Neumeier, Daniel; Taft, Joseph M.; Friedensohn, Simon; Weber, Cédric R.; Kummer, Arkadij; Sesterhenn, Fabian; Correia, Bruno E.; Reddy, Sai T.",bioRxiv,157,24

G. Sawicki, J. H. Lu, and K. V. Holmes, J. Virol. 69:5535-5543, 1995). Virus isolated from passage 600 of the persistently infected cells made smaller plaques on 17 Cl 1 cells than did MHV-A59. Unlike the parental MHV-A59, this variant virus also infected the BHK-21 (BHK) line of hamster cells. Virus plaque purified on BHK cells (MHV/BHK) grew more slowly in murine cells than did MHV-A59, and the rate of viral RNA synthesis was lower and the development of the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein was slower than those of MHV-A59. MHV/BHK was 100-fold more resistant to neutralization with the purified soluble recombinant MHV receptor glycoprotein (sMHVR) than was MHV-A59. Pretreatment of 17 Cl 1 cells with anti-MHVR monoclonal antibody CC1 protected the cells from infection with MHV-A59 but only partially protected them from infection with MHV/BHK. Thus, although MHV/BHK could still utilize MHVR as a receptor, its interactions with the receptor were significantly different from those of MHV-A59. To determine whether a hemagglutinin esterase (HE) glycoprotein that could bind the virions to 9-O-acetylated neuraminic acid moieties on the cell surface was expressed by MHV/BHK, an in situ esterase assay was used. No expression of HE activity was detected in 17 Cl 1 cells infected with MHV/BHK, suggesting that this virus, like MHV-A59, bound to cell membranes via its S glycoprotein. MHV/BHK was able to infect cell lines from many mammalian species, including murine (17 Cl 1), hamster (BHK), feline (Fcwf), bovine (MDBK), rat (RIE), monkey (Vero), and human (L132 and HeLa) cell lines. MHV/BHK could not infect dog kidney (MDCK I) or swine testis (ST) cell lines. Thus, in persistently infected murine cell lines that express very low levels of virus receptor MHVR and which also have and may express alternative virus receptors of lesser efficiency, there is a strong selective advantage for virus with altered interactions with receptor (D.

Possibly, in coronavirus-infected animals, replication of the virus in tissues that express low levels of receptor might also select viruses with altered receptor recognition and extended host range.","Schickli, J H; Zelus, B D; Wentworth, D E; Sawicki, S G; Holmes, K V",Journal of virology,157,33

This study examined hematology and serum chemistry status of a prominent carnivore, the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), living in, on the boundaries to, or on adjacent farmlands to the Serra da Canastra National Park, Brazil. Twenty-eighty wolves were captured, and values were compared 1) between subadults (n=8 animals) and adults (n=20 animals), 2) males (n=12 animals) and females (n=16 animals), and 3) among wolves living inside the park (n=11), near the park border (n=11 animals), and in neighboring farming areas (n=6 animals). Age, gender, and wolf locations influenced (P<0.05) hematology and serum biochemistry values. Specifically, adults had lower (P<0.05) circulating phosphorus than subadults. Males had lower (P<0.05) serum glucose, creatinine phosphokinase, and cholesterol and higher (P<0.05) potassium than females. Erythrocyte count and serum cholinesterase were lower (P<0.05) in wolves living within the park compared with near the park border or on farmlands. Mean corpuscular volume was lower (P<0.05) in wolves living near the park border than those ranging within the park and on farmlands. Aspartate transaminase and chloride were higher (P<0.05) in wolves living inside the park compared with those ranging near the park border. Creatinine phosphokinase was lower (P<0.05) in wolves living on farmland compared with the other two locations. These results clearly reveal a relationship between age and gender on hematology and serum biochemistry values in free-living maned wolves. More importantly, certain traits indicative of health are potentially compromised in wolves living in areas under anthropogenic pressure. These data lay a foundation for examining the influence of farming and local domestic species on disease susceptibility and fitness in the maned wolf.","May-Júnior, J A; Songsasen, N; Azevedo, F C; Santos, J P; Paula, R C; Rodrigues, F H G; Rodden, M D; Wildt, D E; Morato, R G",Journal of wildlife diseases,157,9

The reactivities of the recombinant proteins to a panel of antibodies containing 33 SARS coronavirus-positive sera and 66 negative sera and to antibodies against other animal coronaviruses were screened. A truncated 195-amino-acid fragment from the C terminus of the nucleocapsid protein (N195) was identified that had a strong ability to detect antibodies against SARS coronavirus. No cross-reaction was found between the N195 protein and antibodies against chicken, pig, and canine coronaviruses. The N195 protein was used to develop a Western blot assay to detect antibodies against SARS coronavirus in 274 clinically blinded samples. The specificity and sensitivity of this test were 98.3 and 90.9%, respectively. The correlation between our Western blotting assay and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was also analyzed.

The relative frequencies and seasonal distributions of the specific viruses were assessed. In addition, virus type was correlated with specific clinical signs and symptoms. During the study, 962 samples were collected by 75 medical practitioners participating in the Groupe Regional d'Observation de la Grippe surveillance network. One or more viruses were detected from 348 samples (36.1%), including 108 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 64 influenza virus A type H3N2, 47 influenza virus B, 64 coronavirus, 35 rhinovirus, 22 adenovirus, 5 enterovirus, and 3 parainfluenza-fluenza strains. There were 16 mixed infections. RSV infections peaked in the early winter, and influenza viruses A and B infections peaked during the late winter and early spring. There were two peaks of coronavirus infections (late fall and late winter). Other viruses were detected at lower levels throughout the study period. Patients from whom adenovirus was isolated were significantly more likely to have a fever of > 39.5 degrees C than were patients with other detectable viruses (P < 0.001). Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between influenza and cough (P < 0.01) and RSV and bronchiolitis (P < .001). Thus, the current study defined the overall and relative frequencies of respiratory virus detection from nasal swab specimens in patients with an acute flu-like illness in the Rhone-Alpes region of France during a 7-month period.

Known avian AstVs are spread worldwide; they have been associated with poult enteritis and mortality syndrome in the United States and reported in Italy in intensive turkey and guinea fowl flocks. Nevertheless, their real prevalence and their pathogenic role in avian enteritis affecting Italian flocks is far from clear. Negative staining electron microscopy (nsEM) is used for the routine diagnosis of avian enteric SRVs, although it cannot distinguish morphologically similar particles. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and genomic sequencing are now used for this specific purpose. We analyzed 329 samples of chicken, turkey, and guinea fowl intestinal contents from Italian poultry flocks. Most samples were from enteritis outbreaks, but we also included samples from three longitudinal studies (one on 11 broiler flocks and the other two on a guinea fowl flock). We first examined the samples with nsEM. SRVs, including AstVs, are often associated with rotaviruses and were the most commonly detected morphotypes in avian enteric diseases. We then analyzed 124 of the samples with an RT-PCR targeting the open reading frame (ORF)-1b of AstV. This gene codes for an RNA-dependent polymerase. We then sequenced and genetically analyzed the RT-PCR positive samples. Phylogenetic analysis distinguished three defined clusters: the first included guinea fowl AstVs and turkey AstVs-2; the second, chicken AstVs; and the third was formed by avian nephritis viruses (ANVs). No strains clustered with turkey AstVs-1. The results indicate that ORF-1b presents certain genetic variability, even among AstVs from the same species. In longitudinal studies, samples retrieved from the same shed were homogeneous, with some exceptions suggesting possible coexistence of different genetic types in the same unit. The finding of ANV-like viruses in commercial guinea fowls underlines the genetic variability of AstVs and strengthens the hypothesis of a varied intraherd situation.","Canelli, Elena; Cordioli, Paolo; Barbieri, Ilaria; Catella, Alessia; Pennelli, Donato; Ceruti, Raffaella; Moreno, Ana; Lavazza, Antonio",Avian diseases,157,19

Despite the high incidence, the economic impact of non-influenza-related VRTI has not been rigorously explored. Our objectives were to obtain an updated incidence of non-influenza-related VRTI in the United States and to quantify the health care resource use (direct costs) and productivity losses (indirect costs) associated with these infections. METHODS A nationwide telephone survey of US households (N = 4051) was conducted between November 3, 2000, and February 12, 2001 to obtain a representative estimate of the self-reported incidence of non-influenza-related VRTI and related treatment patterns. Direct treatment costs measured included outpatient clinician encounters, use of over-the-counter and prescription drugs, and associated infectious complications of non-influenza-related VRTI. Absenteeism estimates for infected individuals and parents of infected children were extrapolated from National Health Interview Survey data. RESULTS Of survey respondents, 72% reported a non-influenza-related VRTI within the past year. Respondents who experienced a self-reported non-influenza-related VRTI averaged 2.5 episodes annually. When these rates are extrapolated to the entire US population, approximately 500 million non-influenza-related VRTI episodes occur per year. Similarly, if the treatment patterns reported by the respondents are extended to the population, the total economic impact of non-influenza-related VRTI approaches $40 billion annually (direct costs, $17 billion per year; and indirect costs, $22.5 billion per year). CONCLUSIONS Largely because of the high attack rate, non-influenza-related VRTI imposes a greater economic burden than many other clinical conditions. The pending availability of effective antiviral therapies warrants increased attention be paid to this common and expensive illness.","Fendrick, A Mark; Monto, Arnold S; Nightengale, Brian; Sarnes, Matthew",Archives of internal medicine,157,1

The underlying immunopathological mechanisms, however, have not yet been fully elucidated. PATIENTS AND METHODS We investigated changes in plasma cytokines, T cell subsets, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in 16 hospitalized patients with pneumonia caused by 2009 H1N1 influenza infection. The patients were classified into a severe disease group and a mild disease group according to PaO2. RESULTS Cytokine profiles showed no changes in interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, or transforming necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels throughout the observation period. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta1) was overproduced in the severe group but not in the mild group. Accordingly, we also found some signs of pulmonary fibrosis during the recovery period. Elevated CRP levels and lymphopenia were common in both the severe and the mild group. After treatment, there was a significant elevation in lymphocytes in both groups, but a significant decrease in CRP in the mild group. Lymphocyte counts and CRP levels rapidly recovered to normal levels in all survivors posttreatment; otherwise it seemed to be related to poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS Serial measurements of cytokines showed that only TGF-beta1 was overproduced, possibly in relation to the early use of corticosteroids, which may have downregulated immune responses to H1N1 infection. Pretreatment TGF-beta1 plasma concentrations and absolute lymphocyte counts were independent predictors of severity. However, the role of elevated TGF-beta1 in H1N1 infection-associated pulmonary fibrosis requires further investigation.","Wen, Y; Deng, B C; Zhou, Y; Wang, Y; Cui, W; Wang, W; Liu, P",Journal of investigational allergology & clinical immunology,157,9

Rational setting of priorities requires the balance of risks against benefits in prevention and preparedness. Adverse effects of preparedness include inappropriate warnings, diversion of resources from other public health measures, both in the United States and overseas and constraints on civil rights.

HPS is a zoonotic disease caused by transmission of Sin Nombre virus (SNV) from chronically infected deer mice. In humans, this fulminant infection is characterized by lung capillary leakage, respiratory failure, and cardiogenic shock. Individuals with HLA-B*3501 have an increased risk of developing severe HPS, suggesting that CD8(+) T cell responses to SNV contribute to pathogenesis. We identified three CD8(+) T cell epitopes in SNV presented by HLA-B*3501 and quantitated circulating SNV-specific CD8(+) T cells in 11 acute HPS patients using HLA/peptide tetramers. We found significantly higher frequencies of SNV-specific T cells in patients with severe HPS requiring mechanical ventilation (up to 44.2% of CD8(+) T cells) than in moderately ill HPS patients hospitalized but not requiring mechanical ventilation (up to 9.8% of CD8(+) T cells). These results imply that virus-specific CD8(+) T cells contribute to HPS disease outcome. Intense CD8(+) T cell responses to SNV may be induced by the encounter of the unnatural human host to this zoonotic virus without coevolution.

It is thought that virus-encoded nonstructural proteins and RNA genomes interact on rearranged endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes to form replication complexes, which are believed to be sites of RNA synthesis. We report that, through the use of an antibody specific for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), dsRNA is readily detectable in Huh-7 cells that contain replicating HCV JFH-1 genomes but is absent in control cells. Therefore, as that of other RNA virus genomes, the replication of the HCV genome may involve the generation of a dsRNA replicative intermediate. In Huh-7 cells supporting HCV RNA replication, dsRNA was observed as discrete foci, associated with virus-encoded NS5A and core proteins and identical in morphology and distribution to structures containing HCV RNA visualized by fluorescence-based hybridization methods. Three-dimensional reconstruction of deconvolved z-stack images of virus-infected cells provided detailed insight into the relationship among dsRNA foci, NS5A, the ER, and lipid droplets (LDs). This analysis revealed that dsRNA foci were located on the surface of the ER and often surrounded, partially or wholly, by a network of ER-bound NS5A protein. Additionally, virus-induced dsRNA foci were juxtaposed to LDs, attached to the ER. Thus, we report the visualization of HCV-induced dsRNA foci, the likely sites of virus RNA replication, and propose that HCV genome synthesis occurs at LD-associated sites attached to the ER in virus-infected cells.","Targett-Adams, Paul; Boulant, Steeve; McLauchlan, John",Journal of virology,157,25

To prevent foodborne illness, local health departments nationwide license and inspect restaurants and track and respond to foodborne illness complaints. New technology might allow health departments to engage with the public to improve foodborne illness surveillance. For example, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene examined restaurant reviews from an online review website to identify foodborne illness complaints. On March 23, 2013, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) and its civic partners launched FoodBorne Chicago, a website (https://www.foodbornechicago.org) aimed at improving food safety in Chicago by identifying and responding to complaints on Twitter about possible foodborne illnesses.

Health experts can solve problems by using the electronic and communication technologies without distance limitation. In this study, we try to develop the telemedicine and teleconsultation system between local site and consulting expert site. Two applications of this system in clinical medicine are discussed. The system at each site has a workstation including a cable modem or ADSL connection, a monitor, a web camera, speakers, a microphone for communication, and NetMeeting application software. The first application in this study is to develop a school-based intervention program by using this system for high-risk school-age children in one of the earthquake-struck areas. The preliminary result of this study is that the telemedicine and teleconsultation system is more effective than traditional consultation and supervision. Moreover, we can apply this system in training local volunteers, educators, and welfare workers. Meanwhile, we can save lots of cost and time since we don't need to travel between the local site and the expert site. In the end of this study, the second application of this system in SARS case treatment was also discussed.","Chang, T; Lee, J; Wu, S",Conference proceedings : ...

By immunoperoxidase-monolayer assay 69.1% of these sera were positive for PRRSV. Hemagglutination inhibiting activity was found in 55.1% of the sera for influenza virus subtype H1N1 (strain A/swine/Arnsberg/1/81). in 51.3% for influenza virus subtype H3N2 (strain A/Hong Kong/1/68) and in 14.3% for PPMV. PRCV specific antibodies, as determined by differential competitive blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were demonstrated in 192 of 236 (81.3%) sera. In order to reveal associations interspecific coefficients were calculated for antibody prevalence between PRRSV and the other viruses. Positive associations to PRRSV titres were found to PRCV, PPMV and influenza virus subtype H1N1 titres. chi-square analysis showed the statistical significance of associations regarding PRCV and influenza virus subtype H1N1. Depletion of lung macrophages after PRRSV infection is discussed as a possible mechanism for the promotion of secondary infections.","Groschup, M H; Brun, A; Haas, B",Zentralblatt fur Veterinarmedizin.

The 60,000- and 23,000-molecular-weight polypeptides comigrated with virion structural proteins p60 and p23, and the 60,000-molecular-weight protein was identified as p60 by tryptic peptide fingerprinting. Polyadenylate-containing RNA [poly(A) RNA] extracted from the cytoplasm of infected cells directed the synthesis of both 60,000- and 23,000-molecular-weight polypeptides in messenger-dependent cell-free systems derived from mouse L-cells and rabbit reticulocytes. The reticulocyte system also synthesized a 120,000-molecular-weight polypeptide that was specifically immunoprecipitated by antiserum raised against JHM virions. The identity of the 60,000- and 23,000-molecular-weight in vitro products was established by comigration with virion proteins, immunoprecipitation, and in the case of p60, tryptic peptide fingerprinting. The cytoplasmic poly(A) RNAs which encoded p60 and p23 sedimented in sucroseformamide gradients at 17S and 19S, respectively, and were clearly separable. These RNAs were among the major poly(A) RNA species synthesized in the cytoplasm of actinomycin D-treated cells late in infection, and the in vitro translation of size-fractionated RNA released from polysomes confirmed that they represent physiological mRNA's. These results suggest that the expression of the coronavirus JHM genome involves more than one subgenomic mRNA.","Siddell, S G; Wege, H; Barthel, A; ter Meulen, V",Journal of virology,157,16

The objective was to describe diarrhoea and mortality in beef calves from birth to 30 days of age. Calves (3,080) were followed from December 1995 to April 1996, and a total of 700 visits allowed records of herd management practices, individual data and environmental conditions to be collected. The incidence rate for diarrhoea during the neonatal period was 14.6%, and varied markedly between herds. Eighteen herds did not suffer from diarrhoea, while five herds had an incidence of more than 50%. Results indicate that 52% of diarrhoea appears during the first week and only 15% after the second week of life. The greatest risk of diarrhoea for a calf was during the first and second weeks of life (7.9 and 6.5 times, respectively). The month of birth was also significantly associated with morbidity, the highest incidence was observed in December and March (17.6 and 23.6%, respectively). Escherichia coli was isolated from 20.3% of faecal samples and appeared earlier during the first days of life. Rotavirus was frequently isolated (47.4%) from samples. Coronavirus was positive for only 16.5% but was significantly associated with diarrhoea. Cryptosporidium was less frequent (15.6%). The global mortality rate was 3.6% and was two-times higher in December than in other months. Forty per cent of herds did not exhibit mortality, and 10% had mortality rates greater than 10%. This study confirms previously reported data, and with greater precision and details on diarrhoea and mortality incidences among herds, age and month of birth in suckling beef calves.","Bendali, F; Bichet, H; Schelcher, F; Sanaa, M",Veterinary research,157,11

The aim of this study was to identify significant differences in frequency and severity of depressive symptoms among patients with end-stage renal disease depending on what form of treatment they are undergoing--hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and patients after kidney transplantation. METHODS 323 patients with end-stage renal failure were examined. Among them 206 patients were hemodialysed, 64--undergoing the peritoneal dialysis and 53 patients were the recipients of kidney transplants. We used a self-constructed questionnaire and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). RESULTS Beck Depression Inventory reflects mild and moderate intensification of symptoms. The results obtained by the use of BDI show the mild and moderate intensification of the depressive symptoms in the study group. The majority of patients suffering from depression were found in the group of patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, to a lesser degree in the hemodialysis subgroup and among these, depression had moderate intensity. Patients after kidney transplantation were found to be at a smaller risk of depression comparing to dialysed patients. CONCLUSIONS End-stage renal disease may affect the occurrence of depressive symptoms, the treatment may also play a role in the formation and intensity. We formulated the conclusions of our study carefully, taking into account a multitude of other existing causal factors.","Makara-Studzińska, Marta; Ksiazek, Piotr; Koślak, Anna; Załuska, Wojciech; Ksiazek, Andrzej",Psychiatria polska,157,1

Studies have shown that increasing body mass index plays a role in the incompetence of the gastroesophageal junction and that weight loss and lifestyle modifications reduce the symptoms of GERD. As a method of producing effective and sustainable weight loss, bariatric surgery plays a major role in the treatment of obesity. We reviewed the literature on the effects of different types of bariatric surgery on the symptomatic relief of GERD and its complications. Roux-en- Y gastric bypass was considered an effective method to alleviate symptoms of GERD, whereas laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy appeared to increase the incidence of the disease. Adjustable gastric banding was seen to initially improve the symptoms of GERD; however, a subset of patients experienced a new onset of GERD symptoms during long-term follow-up. The literature suggests that different surgeries have different impacts on the symptomatology of GERD and that careful assessment may be needed before performing bariatric surgery in patients with GERD.","El-Hadi, Mustafa; Birch, Daniel W; Gill, Richdeep S; Karmali, Shahzeer",Canadian journal of surgery.

The goal of this study was to determine if co-stimulation blockade would facilitate chimerism and xenograft tolerance in irradiation-conditioned concordant recipients. METHODS Wistar Furth rat bone marrow (BM) cells were injected into irradiation-conditioned C57BL/6 mice with or without co-administration of anti-mouse CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Chimerism was quantified by flow cytometry, and mice were transplanted with WF rat skin and islet xenografts. RESULTS Blockade of CD40-CD154 interaction facilitated establishment of xenogeneic chimerism in mice conditioned with 600 cGy irradiation. Anti-CD154 mAb was not required for establishment of chimerism in mice treated with 700 cGy. However, mice irradiated with 700 cGy but not treated with anti-CD154 mAb developed a ""graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-like"" wasting syndrome and died, irrespective of their development of chimerism. Xenogeneic chimeras established with irradiation and anti-CD154 mAb treatment exhibited prolonged skin and, in many cases, permanent islet xenograft survival. Chimerism was unstable and eventually lost in most recipients. Skin xenografts were rejected even in mice that remained chimeric, whereas most islet xenografts survived to the end of the observation period. CONCLUSIONS Blockade of host CD40-CD154 interaction facilitates the establishment of xenogeneic chimerism and prevents wasting disease and death. Chimerism permits prolonged xenograft survival, but chimerism generated in this way is unstable over time. Skin xenografts are eventually rejected, whereas most islet xenografts survive long term and perhaps permanently.","Masaki, Hideyuki; Appel, Michael C; Leahy, Linda; Leif, Jean; Paquin, Linda; Shultz, Leonard D; Mordes, John P; Greiner, Dale L; Rossini, Aldo A",Xenotransplantation,157,1

IBV strains of the Ark serotype are highly prevalent in the Southeastern United States despite extensive vaccination. One explanation for this observation is the high genetic variability of IBV. In addition, IBV Ark-type vaccines may induce suboptimal mucosal immune responses, contributing to the prevalence and persistence of the Ark serotype. To test this hypothesis, chickens were ocularly vaccinated with a commercially available live attenuated IBV Ark-Delmarva Poultry Industry vaccine strain and both mucosal and systemic antibody responses were measured. The highest immunoglobulin A (IgA) spot-forming cell (SFC) response was observed in the Harderian glands (HG) and to a lesser extent in the spleen and conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissues, while a limited IgG SFC response was observed in either the mucosal or systemic immune compartment. Interestingly, the peak IgA SFC response occurred 2 days earlier in spleen than in the head-associated lymphoid tissues despite ocular vaccination. Furthermore, IgA IBV-specific antibody levels significantly increased over controls 3 days earlier in tears and 4 days earlier in plasma than did IgG antibodies. IgA antibody levels were higher than IgG antibody levels throughout the primary response in tears and were similar in magnitude in plasma. In addition, a very early increase in IgA antibodies on day 3 postvaccination was observed in tears; such a response was not observed in plasma. This early increase is consistent with a mucosal T-independent IgA response to IBV. In the secondary response the IBV antibody levels significantly increased over controls starting on day 1 after boosting, and the IgG antibody levels were higher than the IgA antibody levels in both tears and plasma. In summary, ocular vaccination induced higher IgA antibodies in the primary IBV response, while the memory response is dominated by IgG antibodies. Thus, lower mucosal IgA antibody levels are observed upon secondary exposure to IBV, which may contribute to vulnerability of host epithelial cells to infection by IBV and persistence of the Ark serotype.","Orr-Burks, Nichole; Gulley, Stephen L; Toro, Haroldo; van Ginkel, Frederik W",Avian diseases,157,16

QOL measures are subjective or objective, functional or satisfaction-based, and generic or disease-specific. Treatment of end-stage renal disease with transplantation and treatment of anemia with erythropoietin in patients with CKD have been associated with dramatic improvements of QOL. Other factors such as age, ethnic or national background, stage of CKD, modality of dialytic therapy, exercise interventions, sleep disturbances, pain, erectile dysfunction, patient satisfaction with care, depressive affect, symptom burden, and perception of intrusiveness of illness may be associated with differential perception of QOL. Recent studies showed an association between assessment of QOL and morbidity and mortality in end-stage renal disease patients, suggesting the measures do matter. Further studies are necessary in patients with early stages of CKD and in children. QOL measures should include validated psychosocial measures of depressive affect, perception of burden of illness, and social support. The challenge for the next decade will be to continue to devise interventions that meaningfully increase the QOL of patients with CKD at all stages.","Kimmel, Paul L; Patel, Samir S",Seminars in nephrology,157,16

The 3'-terminal 530 nucleotides (nt) encompassed a large open reading frame with a coding capacity of 123 amino acids (M(r) 13,649). The predicted protein was extremely basic and hence was considered to correspond to the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene. When compared to the homologous sequences of two reference Netherlands strains (Lelystad and isolate 10) of PRRSV, the IAF-exp91 N protein was found to be five amino acids shorter and displayed a high degree of divergence. Overall, IAF-exp91 strain showed identities of 63% and 59% with both reference European strains at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively. Two amino acid stretches, STAPM and SQGAS, present respectively at the N- and C-terminal regions of the N protein of European strains, were missing in the IAF-exp91 N protein sequence. The 3'-terminal non-coding region (151 nt) of the IAF-exp91 strain was 22 nt longer than that of the European strains. The aligned nucleotide sequence of this non-coding region exhibited an overall identity of 59% with that of the European strains. The Québec reference strain of PRRSV appeared to be related more closely to equine arteritis virus and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus than are the two European strains of the virus. Preliminary data obtained by reverse transcription-PCR experiments, using specific or common oligonucleotide primers, suggested that this approach could be useful for distinguishing between PRRSV strains from different geographic origins.","Mardassi, H; Mounir, S; Dea, S",The Journal of general virology,157,16

In the present study, we investigated the mutational and phylogenetic analysis of 30 whole-genome sequences for the virus's genomic characteristics in the specimens collected in the early phase of the pandemic (March-June, 2020) and the sudden surge of local transmission (August-September, 2020). The four samples in the early phase of infection were B.6 lineage and located within a clade of the samples collected at the same time in Singapore and Malaysia, while five returnees by rescue flights showed the lineage B. 1.36.1 (three from India), B.1.1 (one from India) and B.1.80 (one from China). However, there was no evidence of local spread from these returnees. Further, all 19 whole-genome sequences collected in the sudden surge of local transmission showed lineage B.1.36.

Our goals were to inform planning at our own university, Emory University, a medium-sized university with around 15,000 students and 15,000 faculty and staff, and to provide a flexible modeling framework to inform the planning efforts at similar academic institutions. Control strategies of isolation and quarantine are initiated by screening (regardless of symptoms) or testing (of symptomatic individuals). We explored a range of screening and testing frequencies and performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We found that among students, monthly and weekly screening can reduce cumulative incidence by 59% and 87%, respectively, while testing with a 2-, 4- and 7-day delay between onset of infectiousness and testing results in an 84%, 74% and 55% reduction in cumulative incidence. Smaller reductions were observed among staff and faculty. Community-introduction of SARS-CoV-2 onto campus may be controlled with testing, isolation, contract tracing and quarantine. Screening would need to be performed at least weekly to have substantial reductions beyond disease surveillance.

We developed the 36-item COVID Stress Scales (CSS) to measure these features, as they pertain to COVID-19. The CSS were developed to better understand and assess COVID-19-related distress. The scales were intentionally designed so they could be readily adapted for future pandemics. The CSS were developed and initially validated in population-representative samples from Canada (N = 3479) and the United States (N = 3375). A stable 5-factor solution was identified, corresponding to scales assessing COVID-related stress and anxiety symptoms: (1) Danger and contamination fears, (2) fears about economic consequences, (3) xenophobia, (4) compulsive checking and reassurance seeking, and (5) traumatic stress symptoms about COVID-19. The scales performed well on various indices of reliability and validity. The scales were intercorrelated, providing evidence of a COVID Stress Syndrome. The scales offer promise as tools for better understanding the distress associated with COVID-19 and for identifying people in need of mental health services.","Taylor, Steven; Landry, Caeleigh A; Paluszek, Michelle M; Fergus, Thomas A; McKay, Dean; Asmundson, Gordon J G",J Anxiety Disord,157,11

Spatial patterns of cells, organoids, or inorganic particles can be forced on demand using acoustic surface standing waves, such as the Faraday waves. This technology allows tuning of parameters (sound frequency, amplitude, chamber shape) under contactless, fast and mild culture conditions, for morphologically relevant tissue generation. We call this method Sound Induced Morphogenesis (SIM). In this work, we use SIM to achieve tight control over patterning of endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells densities within a hydrogel, with the endpoint formation of vascular structures. Here, we first parameterize our system to produce enhanced cell density gradients. Second, we allow for vasculogenesis after SIM patterning control and compare our controlled technology against state-of-the-art microfluidic culture systems, the latter characteristic of pure self-organized patterning and uniform initial density. Our sound-induced cell density patterning and subsequent vasculogenesis requires less cells than the microfluidic chamber. We advocate for the use of SIM for rapid, mild, and reproducible morphogenesis induction and further explorations in the regenerative medicine and cell therapy fields.","Petta, Dalila; Basoli, Valentina; Pellicciotta, Daniele; Tognato, Riccardo; Barcik, Jan P; Arrigoni, Chiara; Della Bella, Elena; Armiento, Angela R; Candrian, Christian; Richards, Geoff R; Alini, Mauro; Moretti, Matteo; Eglin, David; Serra, Tiziano",Biofabrication (Online),157,19

Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses monthly trade data at the product, region and firm level. Findings: The COVID-19 crisis has led to the sharpest collapse in the Spanish trade of goods and services in recent decades. The containment measures adopted to arrest the spread of the virus have caused an especially intense fall of trade in services. The large share of transport equipment, capital goods, products that are consumed outdoors (i.e., outdoor goods) and tourism in Spanish exports has made the COVID-19 trade crisis more intense in Spain than in the rest of the European Union. Practical implications: The nature of the collapse suggests that trade in goods can recover swiftly when the health crisis ends. However, COVID-19 may have a long-term negative impact on the trade of services that rely on the movement of people.

OBJECTIVE: To address this global health crisis, artificial intelligence (AI) has been deployed at various levels of the health care system. However, AI has both potential benefits and limitations. We therefore conducted a review of AI applications for COVID-19. METHODS: We performed an extensive search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases for COVID-19-related English-language studies published between December 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020. We supplemented the database search with reference list checks. A thematic analysis and narrative review of AI applications for COVID-19 was conducted. RESULTS: In total, 11 papers were included for review. AI was applied to COVID-19 in four areas: diagnosis, public health, clinical decision making, and therapeutics. We identified several limitations including insufficient data, omission of multimodal methods of AI-based assessment, delay in realization of benefits, poor internal/external validation, inability to be used by laypersons, inability to be used in resource-poor settings, presence of ethical pitfalls, and presence of legal barriers. AI could potentially be explored in four other areas: surveillance, combination with big data, operation of other core clinical services, and management of patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the continuing increase in the number of cases, and given that multiple waves of infections may occur, there is a need for effective methods to help control the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its shortcomings, AI holds the potential to greatly augment existing human efforts, which may otherwise be overwhelmed by high patient numbers.","Chen, Jiayang; See, Kay Choong",J Med Internet Res,157,16

Most state and local governments have adopted some level of ""social distancing"" policy, but infections have continued to spread despite these efforts. Absent a vaccine, authorities have few other tools by which to mitigate further spread of the virus. This begs the question of how effective social policy really is at reducing new infections that, left alone, could potentially overwhelm the existing hospitalization capacity of many states. We developed a mathematical model that captures correlations between some state-level ""social distancing"" policies and infection kinetics for all U.S. states, and use it to illustrate the link between social policy decisions, disease dynamics, and an effective reproduction number that changes over time, for case studies of Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Washington states. In general, our findings indicate that the potential for second waves of infection, which result after reopening states without an increase to immunity, can be mitigated by a return of social distancing policies as soon as possible after the waves are detected.","Rowland, Michael A; Swannack, Todd M; Mayo, Michael L; Parno, Matthew; Farthing, Matthew; Dettwiller, Ian; George, Glover; England, William; Reif, Molly; Cegan, Jeffrey; Trump, Benjamin; Linkov, Igor; Lafferty, Brandon; Bridges, Todd",Sci Rep,157,21

In this viewpoint, we present arguments suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 mutants responsible for the second wave have less virulence but much higher infectivity. This suggestion is based on the results of the forecasting and mechanistic models developed by our study group. In particular, in May 2020, the analysis of our mechanistic model predicted that the easing of lockdown measures will lead to a dramatic second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, after the lockdown was lifted in many European countries, the resulting number of reported infected cases and especially the number of deaths remained low for approximately two months. This raised the false hope that a substantial second wave will be avoided and that the COVID-19 epidemic in these European countries was nearing an end. Unfortunately, since the first week of August 2020, the number of reported infected cases increased dramatically. Furthermore, this was accompanied by an increasingly large number of deaths. The rate of reported infected cases in the second wave was much higher than that in the first wave, whereas the rate of deaths was lower. This trend is consistent with higher infectivity and lower virulence. Even if the mutated form of SARS-CoV-2 is less virulent, the very high number of reported infected cases implies that a large number of people will perish.","Fokas, Athanassios S; Kastis, George A",J Med Internet Res,157,20

Despite these variations, some bat SARSr-CoVs can utilize the orthologs of the human SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry. It is speculated that the interaction between bat ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike proteins drives diversity. Here, we identified a series of R. sinicus ACE2 variants with some polymorphic sites involved in the interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Pseudoviruses or SARSr-CoVs carrying different spike proteins showed different infection efficiencies in cells transiently expressing bat ACE2 variants. Consistent results were observed by binding affinity assays between SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV spike proteins and receptor molecules from bats and humans. All tested bat SARSr-CoV spike proteins had a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 than to bat ACE2, although they showed a 10-fold lower binding affinity to human ACE2 compared with that of their SARS-CoV counterpart. Structure modeling revealed that the difference in binding affinity between spike and ACE2 might be caused by the alteration of some key residues in the interface of these two molecules. Molecular evolution analysis indicates that some key residues were under positive selection. These results suggest that the SARSr-CoV spike protein and R. sinicus ACE2 may have coevolved over time and experienced selection pressure from each other, triggering the evolutionary arms race dynamics.IMPORTANCE Evolutionary arms race dynamics shape the diversity of viruses and their receptors. Identification of key residues which are involved in interspecies transmission is important to predict potential pathogen spillover from wildlife to humans. Previously, we have identified genetically diverse SARSr-CoVs in Chinese horseshoe bats. Here, we show the highly polymorphic ACE2 in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. These ACE2 variants support SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV infection but with different binding affinities to different spike proteins. The higher binding affinity of SARSr-CoV spike to human ACE2 suggests that these viruses have the capacity for spillover to humans. The positive selection of residues at the interface between ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike protein suggests long-term and ongoing coevolutionary dynamics between them. Continued surveillance of this group of viruses in bats is necessary for the prevention of the next SARS-like disease.","Guo, Hua; Hu, Bing-Jie; Yang, Xing-Lou; Zeng, Lei-Ping; Li, Bei; Ouyang, Songying; Shi, Zheng-Li",J. virol,157,16

This study evaluated the performance of T-REIFs in four different periods between January 2017 and December 2020 (2017m1–2017m12, 2018m1–2018m12, 2019m1–2019m12 and 2020m1–2020m12) including the Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) period by applying the Sharpe and Treynor ratios. In a well-diversified portfolio both ratios give the same results, but in the presence of non-systematic risk and the portfolio is poorly diversified, the Treynor ratio is a better indicator than the Sharpe ratio. The findings of this study show that rankings of Sharpe and Treynor ratios may differ for each period. These results also support the fact that the portfolios of funds in the Turkish real estate market are not well diversified. By providing corporate tax exemptions, and by enabling the investors to diversify their investments and reduce their risks, real estate investment funds are important alternatives to direct real estate investments in Turkey. In that context, being one of the pioneer studies in this niche and a new topic in emerging markets, analyzing the return performances of T-REIFs and comparing them with the returns of the BIST-100 index is aimed to contribute to literature as well as provide insight to investors who may consider investing in the Turkish real estate capital market instruments. © 2021 The Author(s).

In a before-and-after study, four patients admitted with severe bilateral pneumonia due to COVID-19 were treated with rectal ozone and confirmed with (+) RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and evaluated afterwards. The analyzed outcome variables were as follows: (a) clinical improvement (O2 saturation and O2 supply); (b) biochemical improvement (fibrinogen, D-dimer, urea, ferritin, LDH, IL-6, and CRP); (c) radiological improvement. The treatment protocol consisted of 5 sessions (1 session/day) of intra-rectal ozone, applied in a volume of 100 mL and a concentration of 35 µg/mL. The Protocol was previously approved by the Hospital's Health Care Ethics Committee (CEAS) (Report 15/4/2020) for compassionate use in the face of this exceptional pandemic situation, and prior informed consent was obtained from the patient/legal representative. The patients improved oxygen saturation, as observed by the lower number of desaturations and the lower supply of O2. Biomarkers of inflammation decreased (fibrinogen, D-dimer, urea, ferritin, LDH, IL-6, and CRP). Finally, the radiological signs of bilateral viral pneumonitis improved between 1 and 2 grades based on Taylor's radiological scale. Rectal ozone decreases O2 supply and improves O2 saturation, decreases inflammation biomarkers, and improves Taylor's radiological grade in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Rectal ozone is a safe, effective, cheap, and simple alternative capable of acting on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and it is presented as an adjunctive therapeutic option to consider in the management of severe bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia.","Fernández-Cuadros, Marcos Edgar; Albaladejo-Florín, María Jesús; Álava-Rabasa, Sandra; Usandizaga-Elio, Isabel; Martinez-Quintanilla Jimenez, Dolores; Peña-Lora, Daiana; Neira-Borrajo, Inmaculada; López-Muñoz, María Jesús; Rodríguez-de-Cía, Javier; Pérez-Moro, Olga Susana",SN Compr Clin Med,157,17

Prolonged fever, particularly that above 39.5 °C, is associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, little is known about the pathological effects of fever caused by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Primary bovine alveolar macrophages (PBAMs), RAW264.7 mouse macrophages, and THP-1 human cells were transfected with plasmids carrying the genes encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein or receptor-binding domain (RBD). Proteins in the macrophages interacting with S-RBD at 39.5 °C or 37 °C were identified by immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown, surface plasmon resonance, and immunofluorescence were performed to evaluate the transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) interaction with SARS-CoV-2-S-RBD at 39.5 °C. Using an RNA sequencing-based approach, cytokine gene expression induced by SARS-CoV-2 S transfection at 39.5 °C and 37.5 °C in primary alveolar macrophages was measured. Fluo-4 staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to assess the regulatory function of TRPV2 in intracellular Ca 2+ and cytokines under SARS-CoV-2-S-RBD at 39.5 °C. Additionally, cytokine release was examined after TRPV2 knockdown with shRNA oligonucleotides or inhibition using the SKF-96365 antagonist. Results: We identified an interaction between the primary alveolar macrophage receptor TRPV2 and S-RBD under febrile conditions. Febrile temperature promotes Ca2+ influx through SARS-CoV-2 infection in PBAMs, further activates the NF-&#954;B p65 signaling pathway, and enhances the secretion of cytokines. Furthermore, knockdown or antagonist (with SKF-96365) of TRPV2 significantly decreased the release of cytokines that drive the inflammatory response. Conclusion: Collectively, our findings identified TRPV2 as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 in conditions of febrile temperature, providing insight into critical interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with macrophages, as well as a useful resource and potential drug target for coronavirus disease 2019.","Xu, Jinrui; Yang, Yuquan; Hou, Zhaoyuan; Jia, Hao; Wang, Yujiong",Theranostics,157,11

Concernant les atteintes systémiques cumulées, seule l'atteinte cutanée influençait négativement le domaine de la santé mentale (p = 0,038). Le domaine de la douleur physique était plus altéré chez les patients traités par corticothérapie au long cours (p = 0,036). Le reste des traitements prescrits au moment de l'entretien n'influençaient pas la QDV de nos sujets lupiques. L'infection par le Sars Cov2 n'influençait pas la QDV de nos patients. Le composant mental était plus altéré que le composant physique chez nos patients lupiques. Ceci pourrait être expliqué par les effets psychologiques négatifs de la pandémie liée au Sars Cov2. L'atteinte cutanée altérait la santé mentale, domaine du composant mental du SF-36. Ce résultat plaiderait en faveur des effets néfastes, sur l'image de soi, des lésions cutanées. L'absence d'influence de l'infection par le Sars Cov2 sur la QDV de nos patients pourrait être biaisée par le faible effectif de l'échantillon.

Clinical indicators were compared between different groups. The differences in sex, age, the proportion of patients with combined heart disease, leukocyte, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet, D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, and albumin on admission between the two groups were statistically significant (P < .05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed NLR and CRP were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. Platelets were independent protective factors for severe COVID-19. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated area under the curve of NLR, platelet, CRP, and combination was 0.737, 0.634, 0.734, and 0.774, respectively. NLR, CRP, and platelets can effectively assess the severity of COVID-19, among which NLR is the best predictor of severe COVID-19, and the combination of three clinical indicators can further predict severe COVID-19.","Shang, Weifeng; Dong, Junwu; Ren, Yali; Tian, Ming; Li, Wei; Hu, Jianwu; Li, Yuanyuan",J. med. virol,157,16

Oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds represent one such class of potential therapeutic agents, particularly in ischemic conditions. As rewarding as the name suggests, these agents, represented by the most advanced and first-in-class molecule, trans-sodium crocetinate (TSC), are the subject of intense clinical investigation, including Phase 1b/2b clinical trials for COVID-19. Being a successor of a natural product, crocetin, TSC is being investigated for various cancers as a radiosensitizer owing to its oxygen diffusion enhancement capability. The unique properties of TSC make it a promising therapeutic agent for various ailments such as hemorrhagic shock, stroke, heart attack, among others. The present review outlines various (bio)synthetic strategies, pharmacological aspects, clinical overview and potential therapeutic benefits of crocetin and related compounds including TSC. The recent literature focusing on the delivery aspects of these compounds is covered as well to paint the complete picture to the curious reader. Given the potential TSC holds as a first-in-class agent, small- and/or macromolecular therapeutics based on the core concept of improved oxygen diffusion from blood to the surrounding tissues where it is needed the most, will be developed in future and satisfy the unmet medical need for many diseases and disorders.","Shah, Hriday M; Jain, Ashvi S; Joshi, Shreerang V; Kharkar, Prashant S",Drug dev. res,157,21

This disease has different clinical manifestations and different outcomes. The immune response to the novel 2019 coronavirus is complex and involves both innate and adaptive immunity. In this context, cell-mediated immunity plays a vital role in effective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Significant differences have been observed when comparing severe and non-severe patients. Since these immunological characteristics have not been fully elucidated, we aimed to use cluster analysis to investigate the immune cell patterns in patients with COVID-19 who required hospitalization but not intensive care. We identified four clusters of different immunological patterns, the worst being characterized by total lymphocytes, T helper lymphocytes CD4+ (CD4+), T cytotoxic lymphocytes CD8+ (CD8+) and natural killer (NK) cells below the normal range, together with natural killer lymphocyte granzyme < 50% (NK granzyme+) and antibody-secreting plasma cells (ASCs) equal to 0 with fatal outcomes. In the worst group, 50% of patients died in the intensive care unit. Moreover, a negative trend was found among four groups regarding total lymphocytes, CD4+, CD8+ and B lymphocytes (p < 0.001, p < 0.005, p < 0.000, p < 0.044, respectively). This detailed analysis of immune changes may have prognostic value. It may provide a new perspective for identifying subsets of COVID-19 patients and selecting novel prospective treatment strategies. Notwithstanding these results, this is a preliminary report with a small sample size, and our data may not be generalizable. Further cohort studies with larger samples are necessary to quantify the prognostic value's weight, according to immunological changes in COVID-19 patients, for predicting prognoses and realizing improvements in clinical conditions.","Corrao, Salvatore; Gervasi, Francesco; Di Bernardo, Francesca; Natoli, Giuseppe; Raspanti, Massimo; Catalano, Nicola; Argano, Christiano",,157,2

However, the lack of evidence for functional decline yields difficulty in distinguishing patients with schizophrenia from healthy adults. Since patients with schizophrenia demonstrate severe facial emotion recognition deficit (FERD), FERD measurement appears to be a promising solution for the aforementioned challenge.We aimed to develop a FERD-based screening tool to differentiates patients with schizophrenia from healthy adults. METHODS: Patients' responses were extracted from a previous study. The most discriminative index was determined by comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of patients' FER scores in 7 domains individually and collectively. The best cut-off score was selected only for the most discriminative index to provide both high sensitivity and specificity (&#8805; 0.90). RESULTS: The ""number of domains failed"" showed the highest discriminative value (AUC = 0.92). Since high sensitivity and specificity could not be achieved simultaneously, two sub-optimal cut-off scores were recommended for prospective users. For users prioritizing sensitivity, the ""&#8805; 2 domains failed"" index yields high sensitivity (0.96) with modest specificity (0.66). For users targeting specificity, the ""&#8805; 4 domains failed"" indexachieves high specificity (0.92) with acceptable sensitivity (0.72). LIMITATIONS: Convenience sampling with mild clinical severity and younger healthy adults (< 20 years old) may limit the generalizability. CONCLUSION: The FERD screener seems to be a discriminative tool with changeable cut-off scores achieving high sensitivity or specificity. Therefore, it may be useful in detecting patients and ruling out adults erroneously suspected of having schizophrenia.","Lee, Shih-Chieh; Liu, Chen-Chung; Kuo, Chian-Jue; Hsueh, I-Ping; Hsieh, Ching-Lin",J Affect Disord,157,27

The aim of this paper is to describe the protocols adopted and to evaluate their impact during the acute phase of Coronavirus spread, focusing on the management of elective and urgent/emergent surgery, outpatients activity, and also health staff preservation from intra-hospital Coronavirus disease 2019 infection. METHODS: Several measures were progressively adopted in the Padova University Hospital to front the Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, with a clear strong asset established by 9 March 2020, after the Northern Italy lockdown. Since this date, the Vascular Surgery Unit started a ""scaled-down"" activity, both for elective surgical procedures and for the outpatient Clinical activities; different protocols were developed for health preservation of staff and patients. We compared a two months period, 30 days before and 30 days after this time point. In particular, emergent vascular surgery was regularly guaranteed as well as urgent surgery (to be performed within 24 h). Elective cases were scheduled for ""non-deferrable"" pathology. A swab test protocol for COVID-19 was applied to health-care professionals and hospitalized patients. RESULTS: The number of urgent or emergent aortic cases remained stable during the two months period, while the number of Hospital admissions via Emergency Room related to critical limb ischemia decreased after national lockdown by about 20%. Elective vascular surgery was scaled down by 50% starting from 9 March; 35% of scheduled elective cases refused hospitalization during the lockdown period and 20% of those contacted for hospitalization where postponed due to fever, respiratory symptoms, or close contacts with Coronavirus disease 2019 suspected cases. Elective surgery reduction did not negatively influence overall carotid or aortic outcomes, while we reported a higher major limb amputation rate for critical limb ischemia (about 10%, compared to 4% for the standard practice period). We found that 4 out of 98 (4%) health-care providers on the floor had an asymptomatic positive swab test. Among 22 vascular doctors, 3 had a confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 infection (asymptomatic); a total of 72 swab were performed (mean = 3.4 swab/person/month) during this period; no cases of severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (deaths or requiring intensive care treatment) infection were reported within this period for the staff or hospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS: Elective vascular surgery needs to be guaranteed as possible during Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The number of truly emergent cases did not reduce, on the other side, Emergency Room accesses for non-emergent cases decreased. Our preliminary results seem to describe a scenario where, if the curve of the outbreak in the regional population is flattened, in association with appropriate hospitals containment rules, it may be possible to continue the activity of the Vascular Surgery Units and guarantee the minimal standard of care.","Piazza, M; Xodo, A; Squizzato, F; Conti, G De; Boemo, D; Carretta, G; Grego, F; Antonello, M",Vascular,157,27

Notably, the virus is now spilling back into a variety of animal species. It appears striking that American (Neovison vison) and European (Mustela vison) minks are the first intensively farmed animal to experience outbreaks. Neither of these have occurred in Asia or Africa but rather in Europe - namely Spain, Denmark, Netherlands and in the US, at a mink farm in Utah. Current evidence indicates that the virus was transmitted to the animals through infected human workers on the farm.At the time of writing, SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been documented in any other intensively farmed species, suggesting that mustelids may exhibit a higher susceptibility to the virus. Studies have shown that domestic ferrets have an extremely low resistance to COVID-19 infection (Shi et al. 2020). Mustelids comprise approximately 60 different species (Kollas et al. 2015) and are widely distributed across a number of habitats, both aquatic (marine and freshwater), and terrestrial (prairies, steppes, tundra, forests). Several wild mustelids have become acclimated to urban areas - such as raccoons, otters and badgers, and some are raised in households as pets - such as ferrets. The latter are perhaps at greater risk of infection than their cousins inhabiting the wild, but it is the former that we should be most worried about. If infection by SARS-CoV-2 spills into wild mustelids, these have the potential to become a permanent reservoir of infection for other animal species. Such a scenario has been seen before with rabies in raccoons and skunks (Rupprecht et al. 1995) and with bovine tuberculosis in badgers (Gallagher and Clifton-Hadley 2000).We believe that it is important to prioritize studies in mustelids on their putative role as reservoirs and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals and subsequently humans. The development of appropriate surveillance and intervention strategies will determine if mustelids are one of the key links in the chain to the initiation of an unprecedented epochal event: a panzootic.","Manes, Costanza; Gollakner, Rania; Capua, Ilaria",,157,16

Well established epidemiological models have been used over the last few months in an attempt to predict how the virus would spread. The predictions were frightening, and the resulting panic caused many governments to impose lockdowns or other severe restrictions, with lasting effects. This short paper discusses another way of looking at the spread of COVID-19, by focusing on the daily rate of infection, defined as the daily rate of increase in the number of infected persons. It is shown that the daily rate is monotonically decreasing, after a short initial period, in all countries, and that the pattern is similar in all countries. This appears to be a universal phenomenon. Based on these calculations, the April 1, 2020 data for Western Europe were sufficient to predict the beginning of the end of COVID-19 in that region before the end of that month.","Ziegler, Zvi",,157,16

Platelets and the coagulation cascade are effectively targeted by antithrombotic approaches, which carry an inherent risk of bleeding. Moreover, antithrombotics cannot completely prevent thrombotic events, implicating a therapeutic gap due to a third, not yet adequately addressed mechanism, namely inflammation. In this Review, we discuss how the synergy between inflammation and thrombosis drives thrombotic diseases. We focus on the huge potential of anti-inflammatory strategies to target cardiovascular pathologies. Findings in the past decade have uncovered a sophisticated connection between innate immunity, platelet activation and coagulation, termed immunothrombosis. Immunothrombosis is an important host defence mechanism to limit systemic spreading of pathogens through the bloodstream. However, the aberrant activation of immunothrombosis in cardiovascular diseases causes myocardial infarction, stroke and venous thromboembolism. The clinical relevance of aberrant immunothrombosis, referred to as thromboinflammation, is supported by the increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with inflammatory diseases but also during infections, including in COVID-19. Clinical trials in the past 4 years have confirmed the anti-ischaemic effects of anti-inflammatory strategies, backing the concept of a prothrombotic function of inflammation. Targeting inflammation to prevent thrombosis leaves haemostasis mainly unaffected, circumventing the risk of bleeding associated with current approaches. Considering the growing number of anti-inflammatory therapies, it is crucial to appreciate their potential in covering therapeutic gaps in cardiovascular diseases.","Stark, Konstantin; Massberg, Steffen","Nat. rev.,Cardiol.

Mouthwash fluid has been reported as an alternative to nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. We compared mouthwash fluid with a combined oro-nasopharyngeal swab regarding test performance. METHODS: In a large refugee facility, we retested individuals with a previous positive test for SARS-CoV-2 and their quarantined close contacts. All individuals were asymptomatic at the time of testing. First, a mouthwash (gargling for at least 5 s) with sterile water was performed. Then, with a single flocked swab the back of the throat and subsequently the nasopharynx were sampled. Samples were inactivated and analysed on a Roche cobas 6800® system with the Roche SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: Of 76 individuals, 39 (51%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by oro-nasopharyngeal swab. Mouthwash detected 13 of 76 (17%) infections, but did not detect any additional infection. Samples that were positive in both tests, had lower cycle threshold (Ct)-values for oro-nasopharyngeal samples, indicating a higher virus concentration, compared to samples only positive in oro-nasopharyngeal swabs.

A test-based strategy that requires negative respiratory RT-PCR tests obtained after the resolution of symptoms. Alternatively, due to the limited availability of testing, many sites employ a symptom-based strategy that recommends excluding HCW from the workforce and keeping patients on contact precautions until a fixed period of time has elapsed from symptom recovery. The underlying assumption of the symptom-based strategy is that waiting for a fixed period of time is a surrogate for negative RT-PCR testing, which itself is a surrogate for the absence of shedding infectious virus. OBJECTIVES: To better understand the appropriate length of symptom based return to work and contact precaution strategies. STUDY DESIGN: We performed an observational analysis of 150 patients and HCW that transitioned from RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive to negative over the course of 2 months at a US academic medical center. RESULTS: We found that the average time to transition from RT-PCR positive to negative was 24 days after symptom onset and 10 % remained positive even 33 days after symptom onset. No difference was seen in HCW and patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest until definitive evidence of the length of infective viral shedding is obtained that the fixed length of time before returning to work or ceasing contract precautions be revised to over one-month.","Gombar, Saurabh; Chang, Marcello; Hogan, Catherine A; Zehnder, James; Boyd, Scott; Pinsky, Benjamin A; Shah, Nigam H",J Clin Virol,157,5

Recent cases with prolonged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection have been successively reported, and the phenomenon of false-negative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or ?repositive? was also described in COVID-19 patients. Methods We report a 69-year-old female patient with hypertension, suspected lung tumor, and previous history of total hysterectomy for hysteromyoma who presented with moderate COVID-19 symptoms and was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR when she traveled from the USA to China. Results The patient required second and third re-hospitalizations due to ?repositive? SARS-CoV-2 throat swab test results during post-charge solitary isolation and observation, and serum SARS-CoV-2-IgG decayed rapidly before disappearing on illness Day 139 when the throat swab was still positive. The virus shedding lasted for at least 146 days (the last positive throat swab test result was on illness Day 146, and the first true-negative test result was on illness Day 151) since her initial positive test. Conclusion Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral shedding is prone to occur in an immunocompromised host, wherein changes in the host immune status can lead to repeated positive SARS-CoV-2 detection. Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2-IgG may decrease rapidly and disappear before virus removal, indicating there may be certain limitations on the protective effect of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody, which deserves clinical attention.","Huang, Jinbao Lan Changqing Wang Xinhang Huang Mingxiang",Journal of Clinical Laboratory Analysis,157,24

Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 evades interferon (IFN) activation in respiratory epithelial cells, resulting in a delayed response in bystander cells. Since pretreatment with IFNs can block viral infection, we reasoned that pharmacological activation of innate immune pathways could control SARS-CoV-2 infection. To identify potent antiviral innate immune agonists, we screened a panel of 75 microbial ligands that activate diverse signaling pathways and identified cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), canonical STING agonists, as antiviral. Since CDNs have poor bioavailability, we tested the small molecule STING agonist diABZI, and found that it potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of diverse strains including variants of concern (B.1.351) by transiently stimulating IFN signaling. Importantly, diABZI restricts viral replication in primary human bronchial epithelial cells and in mice in vivo.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) first emerged in Guangdong, China in 2002 and spread to 29 countries, infecting 8089 individuals and causing 774 deaths. In 2012, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in Saudi Arabia and has spread to 27 countries, with a mortality rate of ~34%. In 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged and has spread to 220 countries, infecting over 100,000,000 people and causing more than 2,000,000 deaths to date. These three human coronaviruses cause diseases of varying severity. Most people develop mild, common cold-like symptoms, while some develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The success of all viruses, including coronaviruses, relies on their evolved abilities to evade and modulate the host anti-viral and pro-inflammatory immune responses. However, we still do not fully understand the transmission, phylogeny, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 and -2. Despite the rapid application of a range of therapies for SARS-CoV-2, such as convalescent plasma, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and type I interferon, no fully effective treatment has been determined. Remarkably, COVID-19 vaccine research and development have produced several offerings that are now been administered worldwide. Here, we summarise an up-to-date understanding of epidemiology, immunomodulation and ongoing anti-viral and immunosuppressive treatment strategies. Indeed, understanding the interplay between coronaviruses and the anti-viral immune response is crucial to identifying novel targets for therapeutic intervention, which may even prove invaluable for the control of future emerging coronavirus.","Zhang, Yamei; Gargan, Siobhan; Lu, Yongxu; Stevenson, Nigel J",Viruses,157,1

This study assesses whether exposure to social and traditional media during the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with mental distress among U.S. adults. METHODS: Data came from the Understanding America Study, conducted with a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of adults who completed surveys online. Participants included 6,329 adults surveyed between March 10 and March 31, 2020. Regression analyses examined the associations of (1) self-reported average time spent on social media in a day (hours) and (2) number of traditional media sources (radio, TV, and newspaper) consulted to learn about COVID-19 with self-reported mental distress (4-item Patient Health Questionnaire). Data were analyzed in April 2020. RESULTS: Participants responding at later survey dates reported more time spent on social media (ß=0.02, 95% CI=0.01, 0.03), a greater number of traditional media sources consulted to learn about COVID-19 (ß=0.01, 95% CI=0.01, 0.02), and greater mental distress (ß=0.07, 95% CI=0.04, 0.09). Increased time spent on social media and consulting a greater number of traditional media sources to learn about COVID-19 were independently associated with increased mental distress, even after adjusting for potential confounders (social media: ß=0.14, 95% CI=0.05, 0.23; traditional media: ß=0.14, 95% CI=0.08, 0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to a greater number of traditional media sources and more hours on social media was modestly associated with mental distress during the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.","Riehm, Kira E; Holingue, Calliope; Kalb, Luther G; Bennett, Daniel; Kapteyn, Arie; Jiang, Qin; Veldhuis, Cindy B; Johnson, Renee M; Fallin, M Daniele; Kreuter, Frauke; Stuart, Elizabeth A; Thrul, Johannes",Am J Prev Med,157,16

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a global health crisis capable of exerting a heavy toll on the mental health of community members while inducing unwelcome levels of social disconnection. Simultaneously, lockdown restrictions have forced vulnerable community members to depend upon the support of fellow residents. Fortunately, voluntary helping can be beneficial to the well-being of the helper as well as the recipient, offering beneficial collective solutions. Using insights from social identity approaches to volunteering and disaster responses, this study explored whether the opportunity to engage in helping fellow community members may be both unifying and beneficial for those engaging in coordinated community helping. Survey data collected in the UK during June 2020 showed that coordinated community helping predicted the psychological bonding of community members by building a sense of community identification and unity during the pandemic, which predicted increased well-being and reduced depression and anxiety. Implications for the promotion and support of voluntary helping initiatives in the context of longer-term responses to the COVID-19 pandemic are provided.

More specifically, although evidence of phonological influences (i.e., phonological priming effects in the SDT) have been reported, Kinoshita, Gayed, and Norris (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 44(11), 1661-1671, 2018) have claimed that phonological priming does not arise in the SDT when the prime and target are written in the same script and the targets are words, the most typical experimental situation. Indeed, it does appear that no-one has yet reported phonological priming effects in such situations. The question of whether it is possible to observe phonological priming in such situations was more fully examined in the present experiments. Experiment 1 involved a masked priming SDT using Japanese Kanji script in which the primes and targets were homophonic but shared no characters. Experiment 2 was a parallel experiment using Chinese stimuli. In both experiments, phonological priming effects were observed for both one- and two-character words. These experiments indicate that, although the priming effects in masked priming SDTs undoubtedly have a strong orthographic basis, phonological codes also play a role even when the prime and (word) target are written in the same script.","Yang, Huilan; Yoshihara, Masahiro; Nakayama, Mariko; Spinelli, Giacomo; Lupker, Stephen J",Mem. cogn,157,1

A 54-year-old public transportation company worker, previously treated for an alcohol use disorder three times, and abstinent since his last treatment in 2017, reported anxiety, irritability, and constant fear of relapse due to increased exposure to sanitizers during the pandemic. He explained that while the diluted disinfectant made him think of alcohol, the now ever-present undiluted disinfectant makes him constantly crave alcohol and it makes it harder for him to work. Although he started group therapy treatment and had several follow-up visits, his poor performance at work and the fear of relapse resulted in him requesting a position change to work in open spaces and avoid the smell of disinfectant, which helped him remain abstinent. Disinfectants are a part of the ""new normal,"" and their increased use is likely to be continued in the years to come, even after the pandemic resolves.

The objective of this study was to assess the detection of influenza D virus (IDV) in bovine respiratory tract samples using two sequencing platforms (MiSeq and Nanopore (GridION)), and species-specific qPCR. An IDV-specific qPCR was performed on 232 samples (116 nasal swabs and 116 tracheal washes) that had been previously subject to virome sequencing using MiSeq. Nanopore sequencing was performed on 19 samples positive for IDV by either MiSeq or qPCR. Nanopore sequence data was analyzed by two bioinformatics methods: What's In My Pot (WIMP, on the EPI2ME platform), and an in-house developed analysis pipeline. The agreement of IDV detection between qPCR and MiSeq was 82.3%, between qPCR and Nanopore was 57.9% (in-house) and 84.2% (WIMP), and between MiSeq and Nanopore was 89.5% (in-house) and 73.7% (WIMP). IDV was detected by MiSeq in 14 of 17 IDV qPCR-positive samples with Cq (cycle quantification) values below 31, despite multiplexing 50 samples for sequencing. When qPCR was regarded as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of MiSeq sequence detection were 28.3% and 98.9%, respectively. We conclude that both MiSeq and Nanopore sequencing are capable of detecting IDV in clinical specimens with a range of Cq values. Sensitivity may be further improved by optimizing sequence data analysis, improving virus enrichment, or reducing the degree of multiplexing.","Zhang, Maodong; Huang, Yanyun; Godson, Dale L; Fernando, Champika; Alexander, Trevor W; Hill, Janet E",Viruses,157,22

It is important to demonstrate how these technologies were implemented during the early stages of this pandemic to identify their application and barriers to adoption, particularly among vulnerable populations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this knowledge synthesis was to present the range of RMTs used in delivering care to patients with COVID-19 and to identify perceived benefits of and barriers to their use. The review placed a special emphasis on health equity considerations. METHODS: A rapid review of published research was conducted using Embase, MEDLINE, and QxMD for records published from the inception of COVID-19 (December 2019) to July 6, 2020. Synthesis involved content analysis of reported benefits of and barriers to the use of RMTs when delivering health care to patients with COVID-19, in addition to health equity considerations. RESULTS: Of 491 records identified, 48 publications that described 35 distinct RMTs were included in this review. RMTs included use of existing technologies (eg, videoconferencing) and development of new ones that have COVID-19-specific applications. Content analysis of perceived benefits generated 34 distinct codes describing advantages of RMTs, mapped to 10 themes overall. Further, 52 distinct codes describing barriers to use of RMTs were mapped to 18 themes. Prominent themes associated with perceived benefits included a lower burden of care (eg, for hospitals, health care practitioners; 28 records), reduced infection risk (n=33), and support for vulnerable populations (n=14). Prominent themes reflecting barriers to use of RMTs included equity-related barriers (eg, affordability of technology for users, poor internet connectivity, poor health literacy; n=16), the need for quality ""best practice"" guidelines for use of RMTs in clinical care (n=12), and the need for additional resources to develop and support new technologies (n=11). Overall, 23 of 48 records commented on equity characteristics that stratify health opportunities and outcomes, including general characteristics that vary over time (eg, age, comorbidities; n=17), place of residence (n=11), and socioeconomic status (n=7). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this rapid review highlight the breadth of RMTs being used to monitor and inform treatment of COVID-19, the potential benefits of using these technologies, and existing barriers to their use. Results can be used to prioritize further efforts in the implementation of RMTs (eg, developing ""best practice"" guidelines for use of RMTs and generating strategies to improve equitable access for marginalized populations).","Houlding, Elizabeth; Mate, Kedar K V; Engler, Kim; Ortiz-Paredes, David; Pomey, Marie-Pascale; Cox, Joseph; Hijal, Tarek; Lebouché, Bertrand",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,157,6

The World Health Organization (WHO) announced in a press conference on January 29, 2020 that the death rate of COVID-19 was 2% on the case fatality rate (CFR). It was underestimated assuming no lag days from symptom onset to deaths while many CFR formulas have been proposed, the estimation on Bays theorem is worthy of interpretation. Hence, it is hypothesized that the over-loaded burdens of treating patients and capacities to contain the outbreak (LSBHRS) may increase the CFR. METHODS: We downloaded COVID-19 outbreak numbers from January 21 to February 14, 2020, in countries/regions on a daily basis from Github that contains information on confirmed cases in >30 Chinese locations and other countries/regions. The pros and cons were compared among the 5 formula of CFR, including [A] deaths/confirmed; [B] deaths/(deathsâ+ârecovered); [C] deaths/(cases x days ago); [D] Bayes estimation based on [A] and the outbreak (LSBHRS) in each country/region; and [E] Bayes estimation based on [C] deaths/(cases x days ago). The coefficients of variance (CVâ=âthe ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) were applied to measure the relative variability for each CFR. A dashboard was developed for daily display of the CFR across each region. RESULTS: The Bayes based on (A)[D] has the lowest CV (=0.10) followed by the deaths/confirmed (=0.11) [A], deaths/(deathsâ+ârecoveries) (=0.42) [B], Bayes based on (C) (=0.49) [E], and deaths/(cases x days ago) (=0.59) [C]. All final CFRs will be equal using the formula (from, A to E). A dashboard was developed for the daily reporting of the CFR. The CFR (3.7%) greater than the prior CFR of 2.2% was evident in LSBHRS, increasing the CFR. A dashboard was created to present the CFRs on COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We suggest examining both trends of the Bayes based on both deaths/(cases 7 days ago) and deaths/confirmed cases as a reference to the final CFR. An app developed for displaying the provisional CFR with the 2 CFR trends can improve the underestimated CFR reported by WHO and media.","Chang, Chi-Sheng; Yeh, Yu-Tsen; Chien, Tsair-Wei; Lin, Jui-Chung John; Cheng, Bor-Wen; Kuo, Shu-Chun",Medicine (Baltimore),157,16

RESULTS: The all-in-one and factorial designs used to assess a combination approach and the multi-arm design used to assess multiple individual components are consistently more powerful than single-factor designs. The all-in-one design is powerful when the individual components are effective without negative interaction, while the factorial design is more consistently powerful across a broad array of settings. CONCLUSIONS: The multi-arm design is useful for evaluating single factor regimens, while the all-in-one and factorial designs are sensitive in assessing the overall efficacy when there is interest in combining individual component regimens anticipated to have complementary mechanisms. The factorial design is a preferred approach when assessing combination regimens due to its favorable power properties and since it is the only design providing direct insights about the contribution of individual components to the combination approach's overall efficacy and about potential interactions.","Chen, Ying Qing; Peng, Lili; Wang, Yixin; Appelmans, Eline; Dasgupta, Sayan; Fleming, Thomas R",HIV Res Clin Pract,157,16

This study examines whether there is a causal relationship (and, if so, in which direction) between people's well-being and COVID-19 anxiety. Two hundred and twenty-two participants (54.50% female, M age = 31.53, SD = 8.17) from 26 provinces of China completed measures of subjective well-being (SWB) and COVID-19 anxiety at three key nodes of the development of COVID-19 in China. The results showed that people's SWB and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the peak (T1), decline (T2), and trough stages (T3) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the cross-lagged analysis showed that the participants' SWB at T0 (pre-pandemic stage; the base level of SWB) and T1 could significantly predict their COVID-19 anxiety at T1 and T2 respectively. However, SWB at T2 was not associated with the COVID-19 anxiety at T3. Furthermore, COVID-19 anxiety could not predict subsequent SWB from T1 to T3. The current findings contribute to clarifying the causal relationship between well-being and anxiety through the development of epidemics, as well as finding ways to alleviate people's COVID-19 anxiety.

In particular, generative deep learning not only provides competitive prediction performance, but also allows for uncovering structure by generating synthetic samples. However, exploration and visualization is not as straightforward as with image applications. RESULTS: We demonstrate how log-linear models, fitted to the generated, synthetic data can be employed to extract patterns from omics data, learned by deep generative techniques. Specifically, interactions between latent representations learned by the approaches and generated synthetic data are used to determine sets of joint patterns. Distances of patterns with respect to the distribution of latent representations are then visualized in low-dimensional coordinate systems, e.g., for monitoring training progress. This is illustrated with simulated data and subsequently with cortical single cell gene expression data. Using different kinds of deep generative techniques, specifically variational autoencoders and deep Boltzmann machines, the proposed approach highlights how the techniques uncover underlying structure. It facilitates the real world use of such generative deep learning techniques in order to gain biological insights from omics data.

An immediate medical breakthrough is needed. However, parallel to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic is the proliferation of information regarding the pandemic, which, if uncontrolled, cannot only mislead the public but also hinder the concerted efforts of relevant stakeholders in mitigating the effect of this pandemic. It is known that media communications can affect public perception and attitude toward medical treatment, vaccination, or subject matter, particularly when the population has limited knowledge on the subject. OBJECTIVE: This study attempts to systematically scrutinize media communications (Google News headlines or snippets and Twitter posts) to understand the prevailing sentiments regarding COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. METHODS: A total of 637 Twitter posts and 569 Google News headlines or descriptions, retrieved between February 2 and May 5, 2020, were analyzed using three standard computational linguistics models (ie, TextBlob, Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner, and Word2Vec combined with a bidirectional long short-term memory neural network). RESULTS: Our findings revealed that, contrary to general perceptions, Google News headlines or snippets and Twitter posts within the stated period were generally passive or positive toward COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. It was possible to understand these patterns in light of increasingly sustained efforts by various media and health actors in ensuring the availability of factual information about the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This type of analysis could contribute to understanding predominant polarities and associated potential attitudinal inclinations. Such knowledge could be critical in informing relevant public health and media engagement policies.","Gbashi, Sefater; Adebo, Oluwafemi Ayodeji; Doorsamy, Wesley; Njobeh, Patrick Berka",JMIR Med Inform,157,1

To address this safety concern, we investigated whether use of remdesivir for COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of bradycardia. METHODS: Using VigiBase®, the World Health Organization Global Individual Case Safety Reports database, we compared the cases of bradycardia reported in COVID-19 patients exposed to remdesivir with those reported in COVID-19 patients exposed to hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab or glucocorticoids. All reports of patients with COVID-19 registered up to the 23 September 2020 were included. We conducted disproportionality analyses allowing the estimation of reporting odds ratios (RORs) with 95% CI. RESULTS: We found 302 cardiac effects including 94 bradycardia (31%) among the 2603 reports with remdesivir prescribed in COVID-19 patients. Most of the 94 reports were serious (75, 80%), and in 16 reports (17%) evolution was fatal. Compared with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab or glucocorticoids, the use of remdesivir was associated with an increased risk of reporting bradycardia (ROR 1.65; 95% CI 1.23-2.22). Consistent results were observed in other sensitivity analyses. DISCUSSION: This post-marketing study in a real-world setting suggests that the use of remdesivir is significantly associated with an increased risk of reporting bradycardia and serious bradycardia when compared with the use of with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab or glucocorticoids. This result is in line with the pharmacodynamic properties of remdesivir.","Touafchia, Anthony; Bagheri, Haleh; Carrié, Didier; Durrieu, Geneviève; Sommet, Agnès; Chouchana, Laurent; Montastruc, François",Clin. microbiol. infect,157,15

Exercise has the potential to improve overall health in several diseases, but evidence remains scant in c-TA. The main objective of this study was to investigate the safety and potential therapeutic effects of exercise in c-TA. Methods: This was a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, to test the effects of a home-based, exercise intervention vs. standard of care in c-TA patients in remission. The primary outcomes were arterial inflammation, assessed by [18F] FDG- PET/MRI and systemic inflammatory markers. Secondary outcomes included, physical activity levels, functionality, body composition, disease-related parameters, and quality of life. Results: Thirty-seven patients were assessed for eligibility, which represents the total number of c-TA patients being followed by the three specialized medical ambulatory services in Sao Paulo. After exclusions, fourteen c-TA patients (71.4% females) aged 12-25 years were randomly allocated into exercised (n=5) and non-exercised groups (n=9). Exercise did not exacerbate arterial inflammation. In fact, exercised patients had a reduction in the frequency of vessel segments with severe inflammation, whereas the non-exercised patients had an opposite response (P=0.007). Greater improvements in visceral fat, steps per day, functionality and physical component SF-36 were observed in the exercised patients (P &#8804; 0.05). Conclusions: Exercise is safe and may improve visceral fat, physical activity levels, functionality, and physical component SF-36 in c-TA patients. Thus, exercise arises as a novel, evidence-based intervention to improve general health in c-TA.

SARS-CoV-2 has been implicated to have originated from bats and pangolins, and its intermediate animal hosts are being investigated. Crossing of the species barrier and exhibition of zoonosis have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 in farm (minks), domesticated (cats and dogs), and wild animals (tigers, puma, and lions). Recently, the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in mink farms, which led to the death of a myriad minks. The clinical and pathological findings of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the rapid animal-to-animal transmission in minks are almost similar to the findings observed in patients with COVID-19. Additionally, the rapid virus transmission among minks and the associated mutations resulted in a new mink-associated variant that was identified in both minks and humans, thereby providing evidence of mink-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The new mink-associated SARS-CoV-2 variant with a possible reduced sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies poses serious risks and is expected to have a direct effect on the diagnostic techniques, therapeutics, and vaccines that are currently under development.

Limited data exist to guide the intensity of antithrombotic prophylaxis. Objective: To evaluate the effects of intermediate-dose vs standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation among patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter randomized trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design performed in 10 academic centers in Iran comparing intermediate-dose vs standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (first hypothesis) and statin therapy vs matching placebo (second hypothesis; not reported in this article) among adult patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. Patients were recruited between July 29, 2020, and November 19, 2020. The final follow-up date for the 30-day primary outcome was December 19, 2020. Interventions: Intermediate-dose (enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg daily) (n = 276) vs standard prophylactic anticoagulation (enoxaparin, 40 mg daily) (n = 286), with modification according to body weight and creatinine clearance. The assigned treatments were planned to be continued until completion of 30-day follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days, assessed in randomized patients who met the eligibility criteria and received at least 1 dose of the assigned treatment. Prespecified safety outcomes included major bleeding according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (type 3 or 5 definition), powered for noninferiority (a noninferiority margin of 1.8 based on odds ratio), and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20 ×103/µL). All outcomes were blindly adjudicated. Results: Among 600 randomized patients, 562 (93.7%) were included in the primary analysis (median [interquartile range] age, 62 [50-71] years; 237 [42.2%] women). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 126 patients (45.7%) in the intermediate-dose group and 126 patients (44.1%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (absolute risk difference, 1.5% [95% CI, -6.6% to 9.8%]; odds ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.76-1.48]; P = .70). Major bleeding occurred in 7 patients (2.5%) in the intermediate-dose group and 4 patients (1.4%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (risk difference, 1.1% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -&#8734; to 3.4%]; odds ratio, 1.83 [1-sided 97.5% CI, 0.00-5.93]), not meeting the noninferiority criteria (P for noninferiority >.99). Severe thrombocytopenia occurred only in patients assigned to the intermediate-dose group (6 vs 0 patients; risk difference, 2.2% [95% CI, 0.4%-3.8%]; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19, intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, compared with standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, did not result in a significant difference in the primary outcome of a composite of adjudicated venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days. These results do not support the routine empirical use of intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation in unselected patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19.

While waiting for a specific treatment, the clinical management of hospitalized patients is still a matter of debate, and the effectiveness of treatments to manage clinical manifestations and comorbidities has been questioned. In this study, we aim to assess the impact of the clinical management of arterial hypertension, inflammation and thrombosis on the survival of COVID-19 patients. The Spanish cohorts included in this observational retrospective study are from HM Hospitales (2035 patients) and from Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (72 patients). Kaplan Meier survival curves, Cox regression and propensity score matching analyses were employed, considering demographic variables, comorbidities and treatment arms (when opportune) as covariates. The management of arterial hypertension with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers is not detrimental, as was initially reported, and neither was the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). On the contrary, our analysis shows that the use on itself of corticosteroids is not beneficial. Importantly, the management of COVID-19 patients with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as an anticoagulant significantly improves the survival of hospitalized patients. These results delineate the current treatment options under debate, supporting the effectiveness of thrombosis prophylaxis on COVID-19 patients as a first-line treatment without the need for compromising the treatment of comorbidities, while suggesting cautiousness when administering corticosteroids.","Martínez-Botía, Patricia; Bernardo, Ángel; Acebes-Huerta, Andrea; Caro, Alberto; Leoz, Blanca; Martínez-Carballeira, Daniel; Palomo-Antequera, Carmen; Soto, Inmaculada; Gutiérrez, Laura",,157,1

The major aims of this study were to: (1) describe the development of telerehabilitation usage guidelines in a large hospital in Israel, and to (2) evaluate the implementation of telerehabilitation from the perspectives of healthcare practitioners and families. An expert focus group developed guidelines which were disseminated to multidisciplinary clinicians. Following sessions, clinicians filled The Clinician Evaluation of Telerehabilitation Service (CETS), a custom-built feedback questionnaire on telerehabilitation, and parents completed the client version of the Therapist Presence Inventory (TPI-C) and were asked to rate the effectiveness of sessions on an ordinal scale. Four goals of telerehabilitation sessions were defined: (1) maintenance of therapeutic alliance, (2) provision of parental coping strategies, (3) assistance in maintaining routine, and (4) preventing functional deterioration. Principal Components Analysis was used for the CETS questionnaire and the relationships of CETS and TPI-C with child's age and the type of session were evaluated using Spearman's correlations and the Kruskal-Wallis H test. In total, sixty-seven telerehabilitation sessions, with clients aged 11.31 ± 4.8 years, were documented by clinicians. Three components (child, session, parent) explained 71.3% of the variance in CETS. According to therapists, their ability to maintain the therapeutic alliance was generally higher than their ability to achieve other predefined goals (p < 0.01). With younger children, the ability to provide feedback to the child, grade treatment difficulty and provide coping strategies to the parents were diminished. Families perceived the therapist as being highly present in therapy regardless of treatment type. These results demonstrate a potential framework for the dissemination of telerehabilitation services in pediatric rehabilitation.","Krasovsky, Tal; Silberg, Tamar; Barak, Sharon; Eisenstein, Etzyona; Erez, Neta; Feldman, Irit; Guttman, Dafna; Liber, Pnina; Patael, Smadar Zohar; Sarna, Hadar; Sadeh, Yaara; Steinberg, Pnina; Landa, Jana",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),157,22

Globally the number of infections and death cases have been on the rise and Africa is no exception. As of May 2020, South Africa had been the most affected country in Africa with Cape Town being the pandemic's epicentre. Pre-empting the pandemic rather than attempting to cure infected patients is very crucial to Africa, considering its poorer healthcare system compared to developed countries, which have struggled to curtain the ravaging pandemic despite the advanced state of their healthcare systems. This paper proposes two models that i) validate the proposed protective measures using epidemic modelling;ii) pre-empt the evolution of the pandemic through data analytics. The first model builds around the classic SIR model to simulate the main protective measures suggested by the World Health Organisation;while the second built on regression models to predict future confirmed cases. Real Covid-19 data of the city of Cape Town were used for the simulations and results reveal the accuracy of the models and the relevance of combining simulation modelling and data analytics as relevant tools in the fight against the pandemic.","Bagula, A.; Maluleke, H.; Ajayi, O.; Bagula, N.; Bagula, M.; Ieee,",2020 Ieee Symposium on Computers and Communications,157,16

Lidocaine spray is a common anesthetic option and is safe for unsedated EGD. Although several studies have compared different topical anesthetic agents, their formulations, and delivery techniques, questions still remain concerning the optimal mode of administration. We have designed a lidocaine formulation in the form of an ice popsicle and compared its effectiveness and tolerability with lidocaine spray in patients undergoing unsedated EGD. Methods: This was a single-center prospective randomized controlled trial. Unsedated EGD patients were randomly allocated the lidocaine spray [Group (Gp) A] or lidocaine ice popsicle (Gp B) formulation. Results: In total, 204 unsedated EGD patients were evaluated. Compared to the spray, the lidocaine ice popsicle group showed better scores for effects in terms of endoscopist satisfaction (Gp A, 7.28+/-1.44;Gp B, 7.8+/-0.89;p=0.0022), gag reflex (Gp A, 1.3+/-0.66;Gp B, 1.02+/-0.61;p=0.0016), patient satisfaction (Gp A, 7.74+/-0.82;Gp B, 8.08+/-0.82;p=0.0039), discomfort (Gp A, 6.54+/-1.34;Gp B, 5.95+/-1.21;p=0.0012), and pain (Gp A, 5.38+/-1.85;Gp B, 4.51+/-2.01;p=0.0015). Conclusion: Both the lidocaine spray and ice popsicle formulations are safe, effective options for diagnostic EGD with the ice popsicle exhibiting better performance. We propose the lidocaine ice popsicle formulation for topical pharyngeal anesthesia in patients undergoing unsedated diagnostic EGD and suggest it may be a suitable option during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A significant increase was detected in the severity of acneiform and inflammatory dermatosis after the use of masks (P < .05). Our study showed that long-term mask use caused primary skin symptoms, such as itching, redness, rash, dryness and peeling, burning, oily skin, and acne formation in individuals who have dermatological diseases, and also increased the existing dermatological facial diseases. Therefore, it should be recommended to use water-based moisturizers as it may have a barrier effect on the faces of individuals who use a face mask and have any facial dermatosis, and patients should be closely monitored for skin diseases on the face.","Inan Dogan, Esra; Kaya, Ferit",Dermatol Ther,157,24

Strains of this virus are a human pandemic threat and a severe economic burden on poultry production. Over the past 20 years they have spread throughout Asia, Africa, Middle East and parts of Europe. As a global industry, a critical need is to re-imagine production and marketing chains, especially in low and middle-income countries, where the structure of much of the industry facilitates virus transmission, especially, but not only, in improperly managed live poultry markets and related value chains. Better, appropriately matched vaccines are needed to support this process but such vaccines cannot, alone, overcome the existing defects in biosecurity, including high farm densities. None of this will occur unless the threat posed by this virus to global health security is recognized.","Sims, Leslie D; Tripodi, Astrid; Swayne, David E",Avian Pathol,157,20

Minimal literature is available to guide best practices. APPROACH: The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) implemented a completely virtual interview (VI) process in April/May 2020. Large-group sessions for applicants, interviews with applicants, and ISMMS Admission Committee meetings occurred via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc., San Jose, California). Large-group sessions and committee meetings occurred via communal conference calls, while one-on-one, semi-structured interviews occurred in individual breakout rooms. ISMMS offered live, virtual question-and-answer sessions with students and faculty, plus digital resources describing program features. After the interview day, applicants and interviewers were invited to complete anonymous surveys regarding their experiences with and perspectives of VI. OUTCOMES: Of 125 applicants and 20 interviewers, 99 (79%) and 18 (90%), respectively, completed at least part of the survey. Of the applicants, 85/95 (89%) agreed VI met or exceeded expectations, many praising the day's organization and convenience, and 71/95 (75%) agreed they received a sufficient sense of the student body. A minority (n = 39/95, [41%]) felt limited in their ability to learn about the institution (commonly related to their inability to tour campus), and a majority (n =74/91, [81%]) would have preferred an in-person interview. Most interviewers felt comfortable assessing applicants' verbal communication skills (n = 13/16, [81%]), and most (n = 12/17, [71%]) felt VI should be an option for future applicants. NEXT STEPS: VI, likely to be a temporary-but-universal fixture of upcoming application cycles, may benefit applicants and interviewers alike by saving resources and diversifying those involved. Next steps are developing programming that will permit applicants to virtually explore the institution and connect more with current students. Future research should evaluate potential bias in VI to ensure an equitable application process for all.","Garden, Evan; Loebel, Emma; Sanky, Charles; Chudow, Jacquelyn; Fallar, Robert; Parkas, Valerie",Acad. med,157,17

However, many EDs experienced decreased demand even for higher acuity illnesses. In this study we sought to examine the change in utilization at a large Canadian community ED, including changes in patient demographics and presentations, as well as structural and administrative changes made in response to the pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective observational study took place in Ontario, Canada, from March 17-June 30, 2020, during province-wide lockdowns in response to COVID-19. We used a control period of March 17-June 30 in 2018-2019. Differences between observed and expected values were calculated for total visits, Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) groups, and age groups using Fisher's exact test. Length of stay (LOS), physician initial assessment time (PIA), and top primary and admission diagnoses were also examined. RESULTS: Patient visits fell to 66.3% of expected volume in the exposure period (20,901 vs 31,525, P<0.0001). CTAS-1 (highest acuity) patient volumes dropped to 86.8% of expected (P = 0.1964) while CTAS-5 (lowest acuity) patient volumes dropped to 32.4% of expected (P <0.0001). Youth (0-17), adult (18-64), and senior (65+) visits all decreased to 37.4%, 71.7%, and 72.9% of expected volumes, respectively (P <0.0001). Median PIA and median ED LOS both decreased (1.1 to 0.6 hours and 3.3 to 3.0 hours, respectively). The most common primary diagnosis in both periods was ""other chest pain."" Viral syndromes were more prevalent in the exposure period. The top admission diagnoses were congestive heart failure in the control period (4.8%) and COVID-19 in the study period (3.5%). CONCLUSION: ED utilization changed drastically during COVID-19. Our ED responded with wide stakeholder engagement, spatial reorganization, and human resources changes informed by real-time data. Our experiences can help prepare for potential subsequent ""waves"" of COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Lee, Daniel Dongjoo; Jung, Hyejung; Lou, Wendy; Rauchwerger, David; Chartier, Lucas B; Masood, Sameer; Sathiaseelan, Seyon; Taher, Ahmed Khaled",West J Emerg Med,157,24

We show that this nanotherapy can decrease lung Ctsl expression in normal mice efficiently, specifically, and safely. Importantly, this lung-selective Ctsl-targeted nanotherapy significantly extended the survival of lethally SARS-CoV-2 infected mice by decreasing lung virus burden, reducing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and diminishing the severity of pulmonary interstitial inflammation. Additional in vitro analyses demonstrated that Cas13d-mediated Ctsl knockdown inhibited infection mediated by the spike protein of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and more importantly, the authentic SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 Delta variant, regardless of TMPRSS2 expression status.

The spike (S) protein, and particularly its receptor-binding domain (RBD), mediates the interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on host cells and may be modulated by its structural features. Therefore, well-characterized recombinant RBDs are essential. We have performed an in-depth structural and functional characterization of RBDs expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. To structurally characterize the native RBDs (comprising N- and O-glycans and additional post translational modifications), a multilevel mass spectrometric approach was employed. Released glycan and glycopeptide analysis were integrated with intact mass analysis, glycan-enzymatic dissection, and top-down sequencing for comprehensive annotation of RBD proteoforms. The data showed distinct glycosylation for CHO- and HEK293-RBD with the latter exhibiting antenna fucosylation, a higher level of sialylation, and a combination of core 1 and core 2 type O-glycans. Additionally, using an alternative approach based on N-terminal cleavage of the O-glycosylation, the previously unknown O-glycosylation site was localized at T323. For both RBDs, the binding to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of positive patients and affinity to the ACE2 receptor was addressed showing comparable results. This work not only offers insights into RBD structural and functional features but also provides an analytical workflow for characterization of new RBDs and batch-to-batch comparison.","Gstöttner, Christoph; Zhang, Tao; Resemann, Anja; Ruben, Sophia; Pengelley, Stuart; Suckau, Detlev; Welsink, Tim; Wuhrer, Manfred; Domínguez-Vega, Elena",Anal Chem,157,16

Correspondingly, the cited references provide optimally-robust procedures to deal with each type of outliers separately, but in case of IO-robustness does not say much about the implementation. We discuss this in more detail in this paper. Most importantly, we define a hybrid filter combining AO- and IO-optimal ones, which is able to treat both types of outliers simultaneously, albeit with a certain delay. We check our filters at a reference state space model, and compare the results with those obtained by the ACM filter Martin and Masreliez[1977], Martin[1979] and non-parametric, repeated-median based filters Fried et al.[2006,2007].","Ruckdeschel, Peter",,157,16

Design/Methodology/Approach: The article is based on a critical literature review of the subject and the authors' research. The study was conducted in November 2020 on a sample of 1009 respondents from all over Poland. The research method used was a diagnostic survey using a questionnaire using the Computer-Assisted Web Interview (CAWI) technique. The obtained data were then subjected to statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation, ANOVA, Tukey's posthoc test, Bonferroni correction test, Spearman correlation). Findings: The obtained results showed that regardless of the generational affiliation, the most critical EVP attributes are stability and security of employment, followed by relationships and high compensation and benefits. Although differences between given generation cohorts were confirmed, their emphasis was relatively moderate. Originality/Value: The need to consider the following was found. The demographic situation in Poland is designated by the process of progressive aging of the society, which results in the simultaneous presence of representatives of four generations of workers on the labor market - Baby Boomers, X, Y, and Z.

Applying RNP capture on another coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, revealed evolutionarily conserved interactions between coronaviral RNAs and host proteins. Transcriptome analyses and knockdown experiments delineated 17 antiviral RBPs, including ZC3HAV1, TRIM25, PARP12, and SHFL, and 8 proviral RBPs, such as EIF3D and CSDE1, which are responsible for co-opting multiple steps of the mRNA life cycle. This also led to the identification of LARP1, a downstream target of the mTOR signaling pathway, as an antiviral host factor that interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 RNAs. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive list of RBPs regulating coronaviral replication and opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions.","Lee, Sungyul; Lee, Young-Suk; Choi, Yeon; Son, Ahyeon; Park, Youngran; Lee, Kyung-Min; Kim, Jeesoo; Kim, Jong-Seo; Kim, V Narry",Mol. cell,157,9

We aimed to quantify this backlog nationally for England and assess how various interventions might mitigate the backlog. METHODS: We did a national analysis of data for colonoscopies, flexible sigmoidoscopies, and gastroscopies from National Health Service (NHS) trusts in NHS England's Monthly Diagnostic Waiting Times and Activity dataset. Trusts were excluded if monthly data were incomplete. To estimate the potential backlog, we used linear logistic regression to project the cumulative deficit between actual procedures performed and expected procedures, based on historical pre-pandemic trends. We then made further estimations of the change to the backlog under three scenarios: recovery to a set level of capacity, ranging from 90% to 130%; further disruption to activity (eg, second pandemic wave); or introduction of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) triaging. FINDINGS: We included data from Jan 1, 2018, to Oct 31, 2020, from 125 NHS trusts. 10 476 endoscopy procedures were done in April, 2020, representing 9·5% of those done in April, 2019 (n=110 584), before recovering to 105 716 by October, 2020 (84·5% of those done in October, 2019 [n=125 072]). Recovering to 100% capacity on the current trajectory would lead to a projected backlog of 162 735 (95% CI 143 775-181 695) colonoscopies, 119 025 (107 398-130 651) flexible sigmoidoscopies, and 194 087 (172 564-215 611) gastroscopies in January, 2021, attributable to the pandemic. Increasing capacity to 130% would still take up to June, 2022, to eliminate the backlog. A further 2-month interruption would add an extra 15·4%, a 4-month interruption would add an extra 43·8%, and a 6-month interruption would add an extra 82·5% to the potential backlog. FIT triaging of cases that are found to have greater than 10 µg haemoglobin per g would reduce colonoscopy referrals to around 75% of usual levels, with the backlog cleared in early 2022. INTERPRETATION: Our work highlights the impact of the pandemic on endoscopy services nationally. Even with mitigation measures, it could take much longer than a year to eliminate the pandemic-related backlog. Urgent action is required by key stakeholders (ie, individual NHS trusts, Clinical Commissioning Groups, British Society of Gastroenterology, and NHS England) to tackle the backlog and prevent delays to patient management.

Here, we estimate the potential number of lives saved and life years gained if this treatment were to be rolled out in the UK and globally, as well as the cost-effectiveness of implementing this intervention. Assuming SARS-CoV-2 exposure levels of 5% to 15%, we estimate that, for the UK, approximately 12,000 (4,250 - 27,000) lives could be saved between July and December 2020. Assuming that dexamethasone has a similar effect size in settings where access to oxygen therapies is limited, this would translate into approximately 650,000 (240,000 - 1,400,000) lives saved globally over the same time period. If dexamethasone acts differently in these settings, the impact could be less than half of this value. To estimate the full potential of dexamethasone in the global fight against COVID-19, it is essential to perform clinical research in settings with limited access to oxygen and/or ventilators, for example in low- and middle-income countries.","Águas, Ricardo; Mahdi, Adam; Shretta, Rima; Horby, Peter; Landray, Martin; White, Lisa",Nat Commun,157,16

METHODS: All patients with LM disease (&#8805;50% stenosis) undergoing coronary revascularisation in England between January 1, 2017 and August 19, 2020 were included (n = 22,235), stratified by time-period (pre-COVID: 01/01/2017-29/2/2020; COVID: 1/3/2020-19/8/2020) and revascularisation strategy (percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) vs. coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Logistic regression models were performed to examine odds ratio (OR) of 1) receipt of CABG (vs. PCI) and 2) in-hospital and 30-day postprocedural mortality, in the COVID-19 period (vs. pre-COVID). RESULTS: There was a decline of 1,354 LM revascularisation procedures between March 1, 2020 and July 31, 2020 compared with previous years' (2017-2019) averages (-48.8%). An increased utilization of PCI over CABG was observed in the COVID period (receipt of CABG vs. PCI: OR 0.46 [0.39, 0.53] compared with 2017), consistent across all age groups. No difference in adjusted in-hospital or 30-day mortality was observed between pre-COVID and COVID periods for both PCI (odds ratio (OR): 0.72 [0.51. 1.02] and 0.83 [0.62, 1.11], respectively) and CABG (OR 0.98 [0.45, 2.14] and 1.51 [0.77, 2.98], respectively) groups. CONCLUSION: LM revascularisation activity has significantly declined during the COVID period, with a shift towards PCI as the preferred strategy.

METHODS: Retrospective cohort of 326 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 through April 19, 2020. Sociodemographic and hospital course data were collected and analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented to examine associations. RESULTS: Compared with non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), Hispanics were younger (53 years, median age) and had higher rates of Medicaid and less commercial/HMO/PPO coverage (P < .001). Similarly, in the age sub-grouped multivariate analysis for outcomes, Hispanics &#8805;65-year-old were 2.66 times more likely to be admitted to ICU (95% CI: 1.07-6.61; P = .03), and 3.67 times more likely to get intubated (95% CI: 1.29-10.36; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized Hispanic patients of &#8805;65-year-old with COVID-19 were more likely to have higher risk of more severe outcomes (ICU admission and intubation) compared with NHW. Hispanic patient's social determinants of health and underlying medical conditions may explain the heightened risk for severe outcomes. Further studies are necessary to more accurately identify and address health disparities in Hispanics and other vulnerable populations amidst COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Macias Gil, Raul; Touzard-Romo, Francine; Sanchez, Martha C; Pandita, Aakriti; Kalligeros, Markos; Mylona, Evangelia K; Shehadeh, Fadi; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",Ann Epidemiol,157,22

Hence, managing the charge-off rates is a vital task for the profitability of the credit card industry. Different macroeconomic conditions affect individuals' behavior in paying down their debts. In this paper, we propose an expert system for loss forecasting in the credit card industry using macroeconomic indicators. We select the indicators based on a thorough review of the literature and experts' opinions covering all aspects of the economy, consumer, business, and government sectors. The state of the art machine learning models are used to develop the proposed expert system framework. We develop two versions of the forecasting expert system, which utilize different approaches to select between the lags added to each indicator. Among 19 macroeconomic indicators that were used as the input, six were used in the model with optimal lags, and seven indicators were selected by the model using all lags. The features that were selected by each of these models covered all three sectors of the economy. Using the charge-off data for the top 100 US banks ranked by assets from the first quarter of 1985 to the second quarter of 2019, we achieve mean squared error values of 1.15E-03 and 1.04E-03 using the model with optimal lags and the model with all lags, respectively. The proposed expert system gives a holistic view of the economy to the practitioners in the credit card industry and helps them to see the impact of different macroeconomic conditions on their future loss.","Taghiyeh, Sajjad; Lengacher, David C; Handfield, Robert B",,157,16

Some previous studies have demonstrated that olfactory dysfunction is associated with increased depressive symptoms. However, these studies were cross-sectional and unable to establish which develops first. We used longitudinal data to determine if impaired odor identification increased subsequent depressive symptoms or vice versa. We assessed olfaction and depression in the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, a nationally-representative, 15-year longitudinal study of older U.S. adults. Olfaction was measured using a validated odor identification test (Sniffin' Sticks). Depressive symptoms were measured using a modified version of the validated Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Multivariable logistic regression models examined the temporal relationships between developing olfactory dysfunction and depression while accounting for demographics, disease comorbidities, alcohol use, smoking, and cognition. Older adults with olfactory dysfunction had concurrent frequent depressive symptoms (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.00 - 1.43). Among healthy adults at baseline, those who had olfactory dysfunction were more likely to develop frequent depressive symptoms 5 or 10 years later (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.13 - 4.37). Conversely, those with frequent depressive symptoms at baseline were not more likely to develop olfactory dysfunction 5 or 10 years later. We show for the first time that olfactory dysfunction predicts subsequent development of depression in older U.S. adults. These data support screening for depression in older adults with chemosensory impairment and set the stage for disentangling the relationship between olfaction and depression.","Eliyan, Yazan; Wroblewski, Kristen E; McClintock, Martha K; Pinto, Jayant M",Chem. senses,157,26

AIM: The objective of this study was to determine how perceived and experienced sexual satisfaction changed with the advent of COVID-19 among heterosexual married individuals in Kenya. METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional survey. Data was collected virtually using monkey survey from social groups. A total of 194 participants responded to the survey. OUTCOMES: The difference in overall sexual satisfaction as well as satisfaction with sex frequency; sex process; and time, place and ambience around sexual intercourse before and during COVID-19. RESULTS: Most of the participants (73.4%) reported that they were satisfied with their marital sex before COVID-19 but the proportion of those reporting satisfaction dropped to 58.4% when they were asked about their experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among participants surveyed during the pandemic itself, therefore, 41.3% reported that they were currently sexually dissatisfied whereas just 26.6% reported that they were dissatisfied even prior to the pandemic. There was a significant difference in the overall distributions before and during COVID-19 (&#967;² = 38.86, P< .001). CLINICAL TRANSLATION: COVID-19 pandemic should be considered an etiology of sexual dissatisfaction and possibly sexual dysfunctions and COVID-19 control measures should incorporate ways of enhancing sexual well-being. CONCLUSION: There was perceived increase in dissatisfaction with sex which could be a pointer to the falling quality of life during COVID-19 pandemic especially among the most sexually active men aged 31-50 years living in places where COVID-19 control measures are being stringently implemented.

The case of a secretive state agency being authorized to do surveillance on its citizens for a strictly non-security-related matter seems to realize many of the dangers that surveillance/privacy scholars warn about with regards to surveillance expansion, function creep, and the creation of a surveillance state. I contribute to existing literature about apathy towards surveillance and the privacy paradox by offering the term ""nontargets"" as an explanation. This term suggests that, alongside social groups that are likely to be targeted by a given surveillance application, there are certain recognizable nontargets that most likely will not bear the brunt of the surveillance, at least not in the short- and medium-term, and thus do not fear it. In the case at hand, which is examined using a qualitative context-bound study, I suggest that Jewish-Israelis are such a nontarget group with regards to this novel Shin Bet surveillance, which explains a significant part of their apathy towards it.","Duke, Shaul A.",Surveillance &amp; Society,157,20

Lack of access both undermines the degree of social benefit achieved by the use of tracing apps, and exacerbates existing social and health inequities because those who lack access are likely to already be disadvantaged. Recently, Singapore has introduced portable tracing wearables (with the same functionality as a contact tracing app) to address the equity gap and promote public health. We argue that governments have an ethical obligation to ensure fair access to the protective benefits of contract tracing during the pandemic and that wearables are an effective way of addressing some important equity issues. The most contentious issues about contact tracing apps have been the potential infringements of privacy and individual liberty, especially where the use of apps or other technology (such as wearables or QR codes) is required for access to certain spaces. Here we argue that wearables, as opposed to apps alone, will make a digital contact tracing mandate more practical and explain some conditions under which such a mandate would be justified. We focus on Singapore as a case study that has recently deployed contact tracing wearables nationally, but also reference debate about wearables in Australia and New Zealand. Our analysis will be relevant to counties trialling similar portable tracing wearables.","Schaefer, G Owen; Ballantyne, Angela",J. med. ethics,157,10

In Spain, the state of alarm was established from March 15 to June 20, 2020. Usually this fact decreased people's mobility and physical activity, in addition to producing or exacerbating psychological disorders. Our aim was to determine the influence that this condition had over the short-term ponderal results of patients undergoing laparoscopic vertical gastrectomy from May 2019 to May 2020. METHODS: Case-control study for comparing the percentage of excess weight lost (%EWL) and the percentage of total weight lost (%TWL) of patients that underwent a VG during the last year, so they were affected by lockdown in April and part of March 2020 (group 1), to the %EWL and %TWL of a control group (group 2), obtained from our previous series. RESULTS: The mean %EWL in group 1 is 47,37±18,59 and in group 2 is 51,13±17,59, being p=0,438. Meanwhile, the mean %TWL in group 1 is 21,14±8,17 and in group 2 is 24,67±8,01, with p=0,115. CONCLUSIONS: Population lockdown by COVID-19 did not get worse short-term results of vertical gastrectomy.

It has a phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV and it was named coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and caused severe acute respiratory syndrome that could lead to death. One of the promising therapeutic strategies for virus infection is the search for enzyme inhibitors among natural compounds using molecular docking in order to obtain products with minimal side effects. COVID-19 virus main protease plays a vital role in mediating viral transcription and replication, introducing it as an attractive antiviral agent target. Metabolic profiling of the aqueous extract ofSalvadora persicaL. (Salvadoraceae) aerial parts dereplicated eleven known flavonol glycosides using LC-HRESIMS. All the annotated flavonoids exhibited significant binding stability at the N3 binding site to different degrees, except isorhamnetin-3-O-ß-d-glucopyranoside, when compared with the currently used COVID-19 main protease inhibitor, darunavir. Structural similarity between the identified flavonoids enabled the study of the relationship between their structure and interactions with the receptor in the N3 binding site of the COVID-19 main protease. The results indicate that the basic flavonol nucleus possesses activity itself. Moreover, the presence of a rutinose moiety at the 3 position of ring C and absence of anO-methyl group in ring B of the flavonol structure could increase the binding stability. This study provides a scientific basis for the health benefits of the regular use ofS. persicaas it leaches bioactive flavonoids in the aqueous saliva.","Owis, Asmaa I.; El-Hawary, Marwa S.; El Amir, Dalia; Aly, Omar M.; Abdelmohsen, Usama Ramadan; Kamel, Mohamed S.",RSC Adv.,157,16

We aimed to describe trajectories of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to before the outbreak, and to determine if trajectories were modified by pre-pandemic loneliness, poor sleep quality and mental health problems. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study with 1836 Swedish university students entering the study before 13 March 2020, the onset of the pandemic, with follow-ups within three (FU1) and six months (FU2) of the outbreak. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to estimate mean differences in symptom levels over time-periods, and to estimate potential effect modifications. RESULTS: We found small differences in mean levels of the depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21) over time. Compared to before the pandemic, depression increased by 0.25 points of 21 (95% CI: 0.04 to 0.45) at FU1 and decreased by 0.75/21 (95% CI:-0.97 to -0.53) at FU2. Anxiety decreased from baseline to FU1 by 0.09/21 (95% CI: -0.24 to 0.07) and by 0.77/21 (95% CI: -0.93 to -0.61) to FU2. Stress decreased from baseline to FU1 by 0.30/21 (95% CI: -0.52 to -0.09) and by 1.32/21 (95% CI: -1.55 to -1.09) to FU2. Students with pre-pandemic loneliness, poor sleep quality or pre-pandemic mental health problems did not have worse trajectories of mean mental health symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom levels were relatively stable during the first three months of the pandemic, while there was a slight decrease during the summer months, probably due to seasonality effects.","Johansson, Fred; Côté, Pierre; Hogg-Johnson, Sheilah; Rudman, Ann; Holm, Lena W; Grotle, Margreth; Jensen, Irene; Sundberg, Tobias; Edlund, Klara; Skillgate, Eva",Scand J Public Health,157,16

We compared product availability, nutritional information, front-of-pack (FOP) labelling, price and price promotions for food and drink products between physical and online supermarkets. DESIGN: For physical stores we collected data on price, price promotions, FOP nutrition labels and nutrition information from a random sample of food and drinks from six UK supermarkets. For online stores we used foodDB, a research-ready dataset of over 14 million observations of food and drink products available in online supermarkets. SETTING: Six large supermarket stores located near Oxford, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: General sample with 295 food and drink products, plus boost samples for both fruit and vegetables, and alcohol. RESULTS: In the general sample, 85% (95% confidence intervals, 80,90%) of products found in physical stores could be matched with an online product. Nutritional information found in the two settings was almost identical e.g. concordance correlation coefficient for energy = 0.995 (0.993,0.996). Presence of FOP labelling and price promotions differed between the two settings (Cohen's kappa = 0.56 (0.45, 0.66) and 0.40 (0.26, 0.55) respectively). Prices were similar between online and physical supermarkets (concordance correlation coefficient > 0.9 for all samples). CONCLUSIONS: Product availability, nutritional information and prices sourced online for these 6 retailers is a good proxy of that found in physical stores. Price promotions and FOP labelling varies between the two settings. Further research should investigate whether this could impact on health inequalities.","Bhatnagar, Prachi; Scarborough, Peter; Kaur, Asha; Dikmen, Derya; Adhikari, Vyas; Harrington, Richard",Public Health Nutr,157,24

To accomplish that goal, we have developed a mathematical model that describes the control of a SARS-CoV-2 infection by the innate and adaptive immune components. Invasion of the virus triggers the innate immunity, whereby interferon renders some of the target cells resistant to infection, and infected cells are removed by effector cells. The adaptive immune response is represented by plasma cells and virus-specific antibodies. The model is parameterized and then validated against viral load measurements collected in COVID-19 patients. We apply the model to simulate three potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies: (1) Remdesivir, a repurposed drug that has been shown to inhibit the transcription of SARS-CoV-2, (2) an alternative (hypothetical) therapy that inhibits the virus' entry into host cells, and (3) convalescent plasma transfusion therapy. Simulation results point to the importance of early intervention, i.e., for any of the three therapies to be effective, it must be administered sufficiently early, not more than a day or two after the onset of symptoms. The model can serve as a key component in integrative platforms for rapid in silico testing of potential COVID-19 therapies and vaccines.","Sadria, Mehrshad; Layton, Anita T",Viruses,157,16

This and other surveillance networks monitor circulating influenza strains in humans and animal reservoirs and are primed to detect influenza strains with pandemic potential.

Despite the enormous progress in structure elucidation, the Mpro's structure-function relationship remains poorly understood. Recently, a peptidomimetic inhibitor has entered clinical trial; however, small-molecule orally available antiviral drugs have yet to be developed. Intrigued by a long-standing controversy regarding the existence of an inactive state, we explored the proton-coupled dynamics of the Mpros of SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV using a newly developed continuous constant pH molecular dynamics (MD) method and microsecond fixed-charge all-atom MD simulations. Our data supports a general base mechanism for Mpro's proteolytic function. The simulations revealed that protonation of His172 alters a conserved interaction network that upholds the oxyanion loop, leading to a partial collapse of the conserved S1 pocket, consistent with the first and controversial crystal structure of SARS-CoV Mpro determined at pH 6. Interestingly, a natural flavonoid binds SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in the close proximity to a conserved cysteine (Cys44), which is hyper-reactive according to the CpHMD titration. This finding offers an exciting new opportunity for small-molecule targeted covalent inhibitor design. Our work represents a first step toward the mechanistic understanding of the proton-coupled structure-dynamics-function relationship of CoV Mpros; the proposed strategy of designing small-molecule covalent inhibitors may help accelerate the development of orally available broad-spectrum antiviral drugs to stop the current pandemic and prevent future outbreaks.","Verma, Neha; Henderson, Jack A; Shen, Jana",J Am Chem Soc,157,13

The 3C-like cleavage sites on the coronaviral polyproteins are highly conserved. Based on the near-identical substrate specificities and high sequence identities, we are of the opinion that some of the previous progress of specific inhibitors development for the SARS-CoV enzyme can be conferred on its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. With the 3CL pro molecular model, we performed virtual screening for purchasable drugs and proposed 16 candidates for consideration. Among these, the antivirals ledipasvir or velpatasvir are particularly attractive as therapeutics to combat the new coronavirus with minimal side effects, commonly fatigue and headache.

A self-administered, online survey was used to collect data and assess psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress of participants from April 10 to 15, 2020. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were utilized to assess psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress of participants during COVID-19 social distancing. The associated factors were explored by using regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1,385 respondents completed the survey. There were 35.9%, 23.5%, 14.1%, and 22.3% who suffered from psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Those respondents who evaluated their physical health as average had higher IES-R score, DASS-21 depression, anxiety and stress than those in good/very good health status (beta-coefficient regression (B) = 9.16, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 6.43 to 11.89), B = 5.85, 95% CI, 4.49 to 7.21, B = 3.64, 95% CI, 2.64 to 4.63, and B = 5.19, 95% CI, 3.83 to 6.56, respectively). Those who were in bad or very bad health condition suffered more severe depression, anxiety and stress (B = 9.57, 95% CI, 4.54 to 14.59, B = 7.24, 95% CI, 3.55 to 10.9, and B = 10.60, 95% CI, 5.56 to 15.65, respectively). Unemployment was more likely associated with depression and stress (B = 3.34, 95% CI, 1.68 to 5.01, and B = 2.34, 95% CI, 0.84 to 3.85). Regarding concerns about COVID-19, more than half (54.5%) expressed concern on their children aged below 18 years, which increased their IES-R score and DASS-21 stress score (B = 7.81, 95% CI, 4.98 to 10.64, and B = 1.75, 95% CI, 0.27 to 3.24, respectively). Majority (94.6%) were confident on the doctor's expertise in COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, which was positively associated with less distress caused by the outbreak (B = -7.84, 95% CI, -14.58 to -1.11).

This study investigated the level of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and turnover intention, the relationship between PTSD and turnover intention, and the buffering effect of supervisor support among nurses post-MERS outbreak. Methods: In total, 300 nurses from three of 15 isolation hospitals in South Korea were invited to participate. We collected data pertaining to PTSD, turnover intention, supervisor support, work-related factors, and socio-demographic factors through a structured survey distributed to the nurses at the hospitals after the outbreak. For the statistical analyses, descriptive statistics and multiple regression were employed. Findings: Of the 147 participants, 33.3% were involved in the direct care of the infected patients, whereas 66.7% were involved in the direct care of the suspected patients. More than half (57.1%) of the nurses experienced PTSD, with 25.1% experienced full PTSD and 32.0% with moderate or some level of PTSD. The mean score of turnover intention was 16.3, with the score range of 4 to 20. The multiple regression analysis revealed that PTSD was positively associated with turnover intention, and supervisor support had a strong buffering effect. Conclusion/Application to Practice: These findings confirmed that after a fatal infectious disease outbreak like MERS, nurses experience high level of PTSD and show high intention to leave. Organizational strategies to help nurses to cope with stress and to prevent turnover intention, especially using supervisor support, would be beneficial.","Jung, Heeja; Jung, Sun Young; Lee, Mi Hyang; Kim, Mi Sun",Workplace Health Saf,157,1

However, a significant number of infected people present as asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic. In this prospective assessment of at-risk healthcare workers (HCWs) we seek to determine whether pre-existing antibody or T cell responses to previous seasonal human coronavirus (HCoV) infections affect immunological or clinical responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. METHODS: A cohort of 300 healthcare workers, confirmed negative for SARS-CoV-2 exposure upon study entry, will be followed for up to 1 year with monthly serology analysis of IgM and IgG antibodies against the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and the four major seasonal human coronavirus - HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63. Participants will complete monthly questionnaires that ask about Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure risks, and a standardized, validated symptom questionnaire (scoring viral respiratory disease symptoms, intensity and severity) at least twice monthly and any day when any symptoms manifest. SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing will be performed any time participants develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19. For those individuals that seroconvert and/or test positive by SARS-CoV-2 PCR, or receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, additional studies of T cell activation and cytokine production in response to SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools and analysis of Natural Killer cell numbers and function will be conducted on that participant's cryopreserved baseline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Following the first year of this study we will further analyze those participants having tested positive for COVID-19, and/or having received an authorized/licensed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, quarterly (year 2) and semi-annually (years 3 and 4) to investigate immune response longevity. DISCUSSION: This study will determine the frequency of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of at-risk healthcare workers. Baseline and longitudinal assays will determine the frequency and magnitude of anti-spike glycoprotein antibodies to the seasonal HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63, and may inform whether pre-existing antibodies to these human coronaviruses are associated with altered COVID-19 disease course. Finally, this study will evaluate whether pre-existing immune responses to seasonal HCoVs affect the magnitude and duration of antibody and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, adjusting for demographic covariates.","Jackson-Thompson, Belinda M; Goguet, Emilie; Laing, Eric D; Olsen, Cara H; Pollett, Simon; Hollis-Perry, K Monique; Maiolatesi, Santina E; Illinik, Luca; Ramsey, Kathleen F; Reyes, Anatalio E; Alcorta, Yolanda; Wong, Mimi A; Davies, Julian; Ortega, Orlando; Parmelee, Edward; Lindrose, Alyssa R; Moser, Matthew; Graydon, Elizabeth; Letizia, Andrew G; Duplessis, Christopher A; Ganesan, Anuradha; Pratt, Kathleen P; Malloy, Allison M; Scott, David W; Anderson, Stephen K; Snow, Andrew L; Dalgard, Clifton L; Powers, John H; Tribble, David; Burgess, Timothy H; Broder, Christopher C; Mitre, Edward",BMC Infect Dis,157,23

In many countries, use of vaccines is restricted due to limitations of subunit vaccines with regard to efficacy and onset of protection as well as failure of live vaccines to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA principle). Chimeric pestiviruses based on CSF virus (CSFV) and the related bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) have been licensed as live marker vaccines in Europe and Asia, but cross-reactive antibodies can cause problems in DIVA application due to close antigenic relationship. To develop marker vaccine candidates with improved DIVA properties, three chimeric viruses were generated by replacing Erns of CSFV Alfort-Tübingen with homologue proteins of only distantly related pestiviruses. The chimeric viruses ""Ra"", ""Pro"", and ""RaPro"" contained Erns sequences of Norway rat and Pronghorn pestiviruses or a combination of both, respectively. In porcine cells, the ""Pro"" chimera replicated to high titers, while replication of the ""Ra"" chimera was limited. The ""RaPro"" chimera showed an intermediate phenotype. All vaccine candidates were attenuated in a vaccination/ challenge trial in pigs, but to different extents. Inoculation induced moderate to high levels of neutralizing antibodies that protected against infection with a genetically heterologous, highly virulent CSFV. Importantly, serum samples of vaccinated animals did not show any cross-reactivity in a CSFV Erns antibody ELISA. In conclusion, the Erns antigen from distantly related pestiviruses can provide a robust serological negative marker for a new generation of improved CSFV marker vaccines based on the chimeric pestivirus concept.","Postel, Alexander; Becher, Paul",Emerg Microbes Infect,157,5

In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in close collaboration with state, local, and territorial health departments, began a 5-year initiative to establish population-based mother-baby linked longitudinal surveillance, the Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Network (SET-NET). OBJECTIVES: The objective of this report is to describe an expanded surveillance approach that leverages and modernizes existing surveillance systems to address the impact of emerging health threats during pregnancy on pregnant women and their infants. METHODS: Mother-baby pairs are identified through prospective identification during pregnancy and/or identification of an infant with retrospective linking to maternal information. All data are obtained from existing data sources (e.g., electronic medical records, vital statistics, laboratory reports, and health department investigations and case reporting). RESULTS: Variables were selected for inclusion to address key surveillance questions proposed by CDC and health department subject matter experts. General variables include maternal demographics and health history, pregnancy and infant outcomes, maternal and infant laboratory results, and child health outcomes up to the second birthday.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted plastic reduction policies at the regional and national levels and induced significant changes in plastic waste management with potential for negative impacts in the environment and human health. This paper provides an overview of plastic policies and discusses the readjustments of these policies during the COVID-19 pandemic along with their potential environmental implications. The sudden increase in plastic waste and composition due to the COVID-19 pandemic underlines the crucial need to reinforce plastic reduction policies (and to implement them into action without delays), to scale up in innovation for sustainable and green plastics solutions, and to develop dynamic and responsive waste management systems immediately. Policy recommendations and future research directions are discussed.","Patrício Silva, Ana L; Prata, Joana C; Walker, Tony R; Campos, Diana; Duarte, Armando C; Soares, Amadeu M V M; Barcelò, Damià; Rocha-Santos, Teresa",Sci Total Environ,157,20

We sought to evaluate mortality benefit among older persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were taking metformin as compared to those who were not. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 775 nursing home residents infected with SARS-CoV-2 who resided in one of the 134 Community Living Centers (CLCs) of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) during March 1, 2020, to May 13, 2020, were included. METHODS: Using a window of 14 days prior to SARS-CoV-2 testing, bar-coded medication administration records were examined for dispensing of medications for diabetes. The COVID-19-infected residents were divided into 4 groups: (1) residents administered metformin alone or in combination with other medications, (2) residents who used long-acting or daily insulin, (3) residents administered other diabetes medications, and (4) residents not administered diabetes medication, including individuals without diabetes and patients with untreated diabetes. Proportional hazard models adjusted for demographics, hemoglobin A1c, body mass index, and renal function. RESULTS: Relative to those not receiving diabetes medications, residents taking metformin were at significantly reduced hazard of death [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28, 0.84] over the subsequent 30 days from COVID-19 diagnosis. There was no association with insulin (adjusted HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.60, 1.64) or other diabetes medications (adjusted HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38, 1.32). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our data suggest a reduction in 30-day mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents who were on metformin-containing diabetes regimens. These findings suggest a relative survival benefit in nursing home residents on metformin, potentially through its mTOR inhibition effects. A prospective study should investigate the therapeutic benefits of metformin among persons with COVID-19.","Lally, Michelle A; Tsoukas, Philip; Halladay, Christopher W; O039,; Neill, Emily; Gravenstein, Stefan; Rudolph, James L",J.

These conditions severely affected body's ability to fight against infectious diseases and also plays a pivotal role in disease progression. Here, in emphasis is on nutritional immunity for regulating effective innate immune response for combating against infectious diseases like novel coronavirus disease (COVID 19). Drawing from discoveries on in-vitro experiments, animal models and human trials, tea polyphenols, micronutrients, and vitamins has the potential to modulate and enhance innate immune response. This article provides a comprehensive review on tea (Camellia sinensis L) infusion (a hot water extract of dried processed tea leaves prepared from young shoots of tea plant) as an innate immunity modulator. Tea infusion is rich in polyphenols; epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and theaflavin (TF), major green and black tea polyphenols, respectively. Studies showed their immunomodulatory competence. Tea infusions are also rich in alkaloids; caffeine and its intermediates, theophylline and theobromine, which have anti-inflammatory properties. Tea plant being an acidophilic perennial crop can accumulate different micronutrients, viz., copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) from growing medium, i.e., from soil, which led to their considerable presence in tea infusion. Micronutrients are integral part of innate immune response.

We describe peripheral blood and bone marrow findings in deceased and living patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We examined bone marrows from 20 autopsies and 2 living patients with COVID-19 using H&E-stained slides and immunohistochemical stains. Clinical history and laboratory values were reviewed. HScore was calculated to estimate risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (HLH). RESULTS: The deceased patients included 12 men and 8 women (aged 32 to >89 years; median, 63 years). Hematologic abnormalities included frequent neutrophilic leukocytosis, lymphopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia; one patient showed striking erythrocytosis. The bone marrows were all normocellular to hypercellular, most showing maturing trilineage hematopoiesis with myeloid left shift. In all 19 evaluable bone marrows, hemophagocytic histiocytes were identified. The HScore for secondary HLH ranged from 35 to 269 (median, 125; >169 in 5 patients).

Awake proning is an attractive intervention in settings with limited resources, as it comes with no additional costs. However, awake proning remains poorly used probably because of unfamiliarity and uncertainties regarding potential benefits and practical application. To summarize evidence for benefit and to develop a set of pragmatic recommendations for awake proning in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, focusing on settings where resources are limited, international healthcare professionals from high and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with known expertise in awake proning were invited to contribute expert advice. A growing number of observational studies describe the effects of awake proning in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in whom hypoxemia is refractory to simple measures of supplementary oxygen. Awake proning improves oxygenation in most patients, usually within minutes, and reduces dyspnea and work of breathing. The effects are maintained for up to 1 hour after turning back to supine, and mostly disappear after 6-12 hours. In available studies, awake proning was not associated with a reduction in the rate of intubation for invasive ventilation. Awake proning comes with little complications if properly implemented and monitored.

Moreover, we demonstrate that &#945;1s haploinsufficiency renders cells and mice more resistant to infection by these viruses. In addition to being more resistant to infection, haploinsufficient cells and mice required a lower dosage of VGCC antagonists to block infection.

Right now, one of the main questions about COVID-19 is whether the second wave is less severe and deadly than the first wave. In order to answer this challenging question, we decided to evaluate the chest X-ray (CXR) severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, the mechanical ventilation (MV) use, the patient outcome, and certain clinical/laboratory data during the second wave and compare them with those of the first wave. METHODS: During the two COVID-19 waves two independent groups of hospitalised patients were selected. The first group consisted of the first 100 COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital during the first wave. The second group consisted of another 100 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital during the second wave. We enlisted only Caucasian male patients over the age of fifty for whom the final outcome was available. For each patient, the CXR severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, the MV use, the patient outcome, comorbidities, corticosteroid use, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were considered. Nonparametric statistical tests were used to compare the data obtained from the two waves. RESULTS: The CXR severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, the in-hospital mortality, and CRP levels were significantly higher in the first wave than in the second wave (p &#8804; .041). Although not statistically significant, the frequency of MV use was higher in the first wave. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary investigation seems to confirm that the COVID-19 second wave is less severe and deadly than the first wave.","Borghesi, Andrea; Golemi, Salvatore; Carapella, Nicola; Zigliani, Angelo; Farina, Davide; Maroldi, Roberto",Infect Dis (Lond),157,10

Several super-spreading individuals have been identified for the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We develop a model for super-spreading events of infectious diseases, which is based on the outbreak of SARS. Using this model we describe two methods for estimating the parameters of the model, which we demonstrate with the small-scale SARS outbreak at the Amoy Gardens, Hong Kong, and the large-scale outbreak in the entire Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. One method is based on parameters calculated for the classical susceptible - infected - removed (SIR) disease model. The second is based on parameter estimates found in the literature. Using the parameters calculated for the SIR model, our model predicts an outcome similar to that for the SIR model. On the other hand, using parameter estimates from SARS literature our model predicts a much more serious epidemic.","Mkhatshwa, Thembinkosi; Mummert, Anna",,157,11

Because of this, we have to make sure that the benefits we get from investing in treatment A are large enough to justify the benefits forgone from not investing in the next best alternative, treatment B. There has been an increase in spending and reallocation of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic that may have been warranted given the urgency of the situation. However, these actions do not bypass the opportunity cost principle although they can appear to in the short term, since spending increases cannot continue indefinitely and there are patient groups who lose out when resources are redirected to pandemic services. Therefore, policy-makers must consider who bears the cost of the displaced healthcare resources. Failure to do so runs a risk of reducing overall population health while disproportionally worsening health in socially disadvantaged groups. We give the example of ethnic minorities in England who already had the worst health and, due to structural injustices, were hardest hit by the pandemic and may stand to lose the most when services are reallocated to meet the resource demands of the crisis. How can we prevent this form of health inequity? Our proposal is forward-looking: we suggest that the government should invest our resources wisely while taking issues of equity into account-that is, introduce cost-equity analysis.","Roadevin, Cristina; Hill, Harry",J. med. ethics,157,21

OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of the local COVID-19 outbreak on routine child health services. METHODS: The District Health Information System data set for KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) provincial health services was accessed, and monthly child health-related data were extracted for the period January 2018 - June 2020. Chronological and geographical variations in sentinel indicators for service access, service delivery and the wellbeing of children were assessed. RESULTS: During April - June 2020, following the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in KZN, significant declines were seen for clinic attendance (36%; p=0.001) and hospital admissions (50%; p=0.005) of children aged &lt;5 years, with a modest recovery in clinic attendance only. Among service delivery indicators, immunisation coverage recovered most rapidly, with vitamin A supplementation, deworming and food supplementation remaining low. Changes were less pronounced for in- and out-of-hospital births and uptake rates of infant polymerase chain reaction testing for HIV at birth, albeit with wide interdistrict variations, indicating inequalities in access to and provision of maternal and neonatal care. A temporary 47% increase in neonatal facility deaths was reported in May 2020 that could potentially be attributed to COVID-19-related disruption and diversion of health resources. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple indicators demonstrated disruption in service access, service delivery and child wellbeing. Further studies are needed to establish the intermediate- and long-term impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on child health, as well as strategies to mitigate these.","Jensen, C; McKerrow, N H",S Afr Med J,157,2

In response, the Canadian Association of Radiologists Resident & Fellow Section (CAR RFS) and Medical Student Network (MSN) developed and evaluated an online series for medical students to learn about Canadian radiology residency programs. METHODS: Medical students from any year of training were recruited through the MSN, local radiology interest groups, and social media to attend a 2-week online series of interactive sessions via Zoom with program representatives from Canadian radiology residency programs. A survey evaluating the online series, in particular its impact on residency and career planning, was administered to program representatives and students. RESULTS: Fifteen of Canada's 16 radiology residency programs participated in the online series. A total of 212 students attended at least one session and nearly half were participating in the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) this year. The postsurvey revealed that 77% of students agreed that the online series helped prepare them for CaRMS and ranking programs. The online series also benefited pre-CaRMS students as significantly more students were considering radiology as a specialty on the postsurvey compared to the presurvey. Students and program representatives agreed that this series should be held in future years, regardless of whether health and travel restrictions are lifted. CONCLUSION: The CAR RFS and MSN hosted an online series for medical students to learn about radiology residency programs outside their home institution. Feedback was highly positive with important implications for the future CaRMS iterations for any specialty.","Linehan, Victoria; Katlariwala, Prayash; Chahal, Baljot S; Khatchikian, Aline D; Supersad, Alanna; Dobson, Jessica L",Acad. radiol,157,33

However, evidence on vertical transmission and natural passive immunity among the newborns exposed to COVID-19 is scanty and varies. This poses a challenge on preventive interventions for the newborns. We conducted a systematic review to first, determine the likelihood of vertical transmission among COVID-19 exposed infants and second, determine whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were generated among COVID-19 vertically exposed but negative infants. This review registered in PROSPERO searched evidence from PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar, among others. About 517 studies were pooled, where 33 articles (5.8%) met the inclusion criteria such as infection prevention and control measures at birth. A total of 205 infants born to COVID-19 positive mothers were studied. Overall, 6.3% (13/205; 95% CI: 3.0%-9.7%) of the infants tested positive for COVID-19 virus at birth. Of 33 eligible studies, six studies (18.8%) reported about immunoglobulin G/M (IgG/IgM) against SARS-CoV-2. IgG/IgM were detected in 90% infants (10/11; 95% CI: 73.9%-107.9%) who tested negative for COVID-19 virus. The median antibody levels detected were 75.49 AU/ml (range, 7.25-140.32 AU/ml) and 3.79 AU/ml (range, 0.16-45.83 AU/ml), p = .0041 for IgG and IgM, respectively. In conclusion, the current evidence revealed a low possibility of vertical transmission of COVID-19 and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected among vertically exposed but negative infants.

METHODS: Data comes from 59 population-based cancer registries in 22 countries. KS was defined as ICD-O-3 morphology code 9140 combined with any topography code. Crude and age-adjusted incidence rates and relative survival for years of diagnosis 2000-2007 and with trends during 1995-2007 were calculated overall, by age and by country. RESULTS: The crude annual incidence rate was 0.28 per 100,000 and age-adjusted incidence was 0.23 per 100,000; incidence increased with age, from 0.18/100,000 at age 0-44 to 0.25/100,000 at age 45-64 and 0.69/100,000 at age 65 and over. Age-adjusted incidence in males was more than four times that in females. Portugal, which had the highest incidence of AIDS in Europe, had by far the highest incidence of KS at age 0-44, 1.44/100,000, more than four times the rate in any other country. Incidence among males in Europe aged 0-44 fell significantly between 1995-1998 and 1999-2002, followed by a significant increase in 2003-2007. Younger patients, with predominantly AIDS-related KS, formerly had a worse prognosis, but since 1999-2001 5-year relative survival increased for patients aged under 65, and by 2005-2007 was 83-86 % for all three age groups 0-44, 45-64, and 65 and over. CONCLUSION: Survival and quality of life for the increasing number of people in Europe affected by KS should improve further following the development of evidence-based guidelines for its management. Population-based cancer registries will continue to play a vital role in monitoring the burden of KS and improvements in its outcome.","Stiller, Charles A; Botta, Laura; Sánchez Perez, Maria José; Chirlaque López, María Dolores; Marcos-Gragera, Rafael; Scuderi, Tiziana; Huws, Dyfed Wyn; Trama, Annalisa",Cancer Epidemiol,157,26

Until now, few antiviral medications (e.g., remdesivir) or drugs that target inflammatory complications associated with SARS-CoV2 infection have been considered safe by public health authorities. By the end of November 2020, this crisis had led to >1 million deaths and revealed the high susceptibility of people with pre-existing comorbidities (e.g., obesity, diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension) to suffer from a severe form of the disease. Elderly people have also been found to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection and morbidity. Gastrointestinal manifestations and gut microbial alterations observed in SARS-CoV2-infected hospitalized patients have raised awareness of the potential role of intestinal mechanisms in increasing the severity of the disease. It is therefore critically important to find alternative or complementary approaches, not only to prevent or treat the disease, but also to reduce its growing societal and economic burden. In this review, we explore potential nutritional strategies that implicate the use of polyphenols, probiotics, vitamin D, and &#969;-3 fatty acids with a focus on the gut microbiome, and that could lead to concrete recommendations that are easily applicable to both vulnerable people with pre-existing metabolic comorbidities and the elderly, but also to the general population.","Daoust, Laurence; Pilon, Geneviève; Marette, André","Adv. nutr.

For the first and third passages of strain 23/2013, virus loads were 6.699 log copies/μL and 6 log copies/μL and, for 38/2013, 5.699 log copies/μL and 2.699 log copies/μL of reaction, respectively. The first passage of strain 23/2013 contained no variant haplotype, while, for the third passage, five putative variant haplotypes were found, with &gt; 99.9% full genome identity with each other and with the dominant genome. Regarding strain 38/2013, five variant haplotypes were found for the first passage, with &gt; 99.9% full genome identity with each other and with the dominant genome, and a single variant haplotype was found. Extinction and emergence of haplotypes with polymorphisms in genes involved in receptor binding and regulation of RNA synthesis were observed, suggesting that phenotypic traits of AvCoV isolates are a result of their mutant spectrum.","Brandão, Paulo Eduardo; Hora, Aline S.; Silva, Sheila O.

However, the physiological demands of singing and its intensity as a physical activity are not well understood. METHODS: We compared cardiorespiratory parameters while completing components of Singing for Lung Health sessions, with treadmill walking at differing speeds (2, 4 and 6 km/hour). RESULTS: Eight healthy adults were included, none of whom reported regular participation in formal singing activities. Singing induced acute physiological responses that were consistent with moderate intensity activity (metabolic equivalents: median 4.12, IQR 2.72-4.78), with oxygen consumption, heart rate and volume per breath above those seen walking at 4 km/hour. Minute ventilation was higher during singing (median 22.42 L/min, IQR 16.83-30.54) than at rest (11 L/min, 9-13), lower than 6 km/hour walking (30.35 L/min, 26.94-41.11), but not statistically different from 2 km/hour (18.77 L/min, 16.89-21.35) or 4 km/hour (23.27 L/min, 20.09-26.37) walking. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the acute metabolic demands of singing are comparable with walking at a moderately brisk pace, hence, physical effects may contribute to the health and well-being benefits attributed to singing participation. However, if physical training benefits result remains uncertain. Further research including different singing styles, singers and physical performance impacts when used as a training modality is encouraged.

In the beginning of the pandemic, counties with either very low poverty levels or very high poverty levels reported the highest numbers of cases. A U-shaped relationship prevails for counties with high population density while among counties with low population density, only poorer counties report high incidence rates of COVID-19. Second, we discuss the pattern of infections spreading from higher to lower income counties. Third, we show that stay-at-home mandates caused significantly higher reductions in mobility in high income counties that experienced adverse weather shocks than counties that did not. These effects are not present in counties with high poverty rates. Using weather shocks in combination with stay-at-home mandates as an instrument for social distancing, we find that measures taken to promote social distancing helped curb infections in high income counties but not in low income counties.

As the pandemic has spread, the low availability of medical equipment has increased, especially mechanical ventilators. The Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) claimed to have only 40,508 mechanical ventilators, which would be insufficient to support the Brazilian population at the pandemic peak. This lack of ventilators, especially in public hospitals, required quick, assertive, and effective actions to minimize the health crisis. This work provides an overview of the rapid deployment of a network for maintaining disused mechanical ventilators in public and private healthcare units in some regions of Brazil during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data referring to the processes of maintaining equipment, acquiring parts, and conducting national and international training were collected and analyzed. In total, 4047 ventilators were received by the maintenance sites, and 2516 ventilators were successfully repaired and returned to the healthcare units, which represents a success rate of 62.17%. The results show that the maintenance initiative directly impacted the availability and reliability of the equipment, allowing access to ventilators in the public and private health system and increasing the capacity of beds during the pandemic.","Motta, Daniel Amaral Luiz Fernando Taboada Gomes Silva Bruno Caetano dos Santos Gomes Lucas de Freitas Barbosa Willams Teles Coelho Rodrigo Santiago Machado Bruna Aparecida Souza",Healthcare,157,16

However, no prior studies examined temporal trends and differential effects of social vulnerability on COVID-19 incidence and death rates. Therefore, we examined temporal trends among counties with high and low social vulnerability to quantify disparities in trends over time. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal analysis examining COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 15 to December 31, 2020, for each US county using data from USAFacts. We classified counties using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with higher values indicating more vulnerability. Using a Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model, we estimated daily risk ratios (RRs) comparing counties in the first (lower) and fourth (upper) SVI quartiles, adjusting for rurality, percentage in poor or fair health, percentage female, percentage of smokers, county average daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5), percentage of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents, daily temperature and precipitation, and proportion tested for COVID-19. RESULTS: At the outset of the pandemic, the most vulnerable counties had, on average, fewer cases per 100,000 than least vulnerable SVI quartile. However, on March 28, we observed a crossover effect in which the most vulnerable counties experienced higher COVID-19 incidence rates compared to the least vulnerable counties (RR = 1.05, 95% PI: 0.98, 1.12). Vulnerable counties had higher death rates starting on May 21 (RR = 1.08, 95% PI: 1.00,1.16). However, by October, this trend reversed and the most vulnerable counties had lower death rates compared to least vulnerable counties. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19 is not static but can migrate from less vulnerable counties to more vulnerable counties and back again over time.","Neelon, Brian; Mutiso, Fedelis; Mueller, Noel T; Pearce, John L; Benjamin-Neelon, Sara E",PLoS One,157,14

A useful component of such applications is inter-device distance estimation, which can be formulated as a network localization problem. We survey several approaches and evaluate the performance of each on real and simulated Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) measurement datasets with respect to both distance estimate accuracy and the proximity detection problem. We investigate the effects of obstructions like pockets, differences between device models, and the environment (i.e. indoors or outdoors) on performance. We conclude that while direct estimation can provide the best proximity detection when Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements are available, network localization algorithms like Isomap, Local Linear Embedding, and the spring model outperform direct estimation in the presence of missing or very noisy measurements. The spring model consistently achieves the best distance estimation accuracy.","Clark, Lillian; Papalia, Alan; Carvalho, Jonata Tyska; Mastrostefano, Luca; Krishnamachari, Bhaskar",,157,17

In such situations, pregnant women are suspected of being among the vulnerable groups. The aim of this study was to report clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and obstetrical complications, maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women. We searched the Cochrane library, MEDLINE/PubMed, and Web of Sciences from their inception to April 5, 2020. Any study involving pregnant women with COVID-19 which evaluated the effect of the disease on pregnancy outcomes and fetal and neonatal complications was included in the study. The outcomes were the symptoms and laboratory findings, obstetrical complications, mode of delivery, and maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications. The search resulted in 69 titles and abstracts, which were narrowed down to 12 studies involving 68 women. The three most common symptoms of patients were fever, cough, and fatigue. The most common laboratory findings were an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) and lymphopenia. The most common obstetrical complication was preterm labor (33.3%). No maternal deaths were reported. The Cesarean section rate was 83.3% and the vertical transition rate was 2.23%. The findings showed that the clinical symptoms and laboratory measures of pregnant women affected by COVID-19 did not differ from the general population. In general, the prognosis of mothers who suffered from COVID-19 and their newborns was satisfactory. However, there is a need for further rigorous studies to confirm these findings as the pandemic progresses.","Makvandi, Somayeh; Mahdavian, Mitra; Kazemi-Nia, Goli; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Guest, Paul C; Karimi, Leila; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Adv Exp Med Biol,157,16

We created a panel data set of 1,563 U.S. counties to study the impact of U.S. counties' stay-at-home orders on community mobility before and after The White House's campaign to reopen the country. Our results suggest that before the OuAA campaign stay-at-home orders were effective in decreasing time spent at retail&recreation places and in increasing time spent at home. These stay-at-home orders were less effective in more conservative counties. We further find that the OuAA campaign significantly increased time spent at retail&recreation places and decreased time spent at home particularly in conservative counties. However, in conservative counties with stay-at-home orders in place, OuAA campaign was less effective when compared to conservative counties without stay-at-home orders. These findings signal promising news for local (county and state) authorities. That is, even when the federal government is reopening the country, the local authorities that enforced stay-at-home restrictions were to some extent effective.","Mousavi, Reza; Gu, Bin",,157,1

In addition, we investigated how this relationship is moderated by an individual’s motivation to communicate through social media (LinkedIn). Based on social capital theory and the conservation of resources theory, we developed a set of hypotheses that were tested based on longitudinal data collected from university employees (N = 101) in middle- and high-level jobs. First, in line with our expectations, social media use for professional development was significantly higher after the learning intervention than before. Second, partially in line with our expectations, social media use for professional development was positively related with the employability dimension anticipation and optimization. Third, contrary to our expectations, motivation to communicate through social media (LinkedIn) did not have a moderating role in this relationship. We concluded that the learning intervention has the potential to foster social media use for professional development, and in turn, can contribute to individuals’ human capital in terms of their employability. Hence, the intervention that forms the core of this empirical research can be a sustainable and promising human resource management (HRM) practice that fits the human capital agenda.","Habets, Omar Van der Heijden Beatrice Ramzy Omar Stoffers Jol Peters Pascale",Sustainability,157,20

A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of severe pneumonia and has rapidly spread through many nations, crashing health systems and leading a large number of people to death. In Brazil, the emergence of local epidemics in major metropolitan areas has always been a concern. In a vast and heterogeneous country, with regional disparities and climate diversity, several factors can modulate the dynamics of COVID-19. What should be the scenario for inner Brazil, and what can we do to control infection transmission in each of these locations? Here, a mathematical model is proposed to simulate disease transmission among individuals in several scenarios, differing by abiotic factors, social-economic factors, and effectiveness of mitigation strategies. The disease control relies on keeping all individuals' social distancing and detecting, followed by isolating, infected ones. The model reinforces social distancing as the most efficient method to control disease transmission. Moreover, it also shows that improving the detection and isolation of infected individuals can loosen this mitigation strategy. Finally, the effectiveness of control may be different across the country, and understanding it can help set up public health strategies.","Almeida, G B; Vilches, T N; Ferreira, C P; Fortaleza, C M C B",Sci Rep,157,25

This study was conducted to assess the CT features in confirmed cases with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively, initial chest CT data of 363 confirmed cases with COVID-19 were reviewed. All subjects were stratified into three groups based on patients' clinical outcomes; non-critical group (n=194), critical group (n=65), and death group (n=104). The detailed of CT findings were collected from patients' medical records and then evaluated for each group. In addition, multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors according to CT findings in three groups of patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Compared with the non-critical group, mixed ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation lesion, pleural effusion lesion, presence of diffuse opacity in cases, more than 2 lobes involved and opacity scores were significantly higher in the critical and death groups (P<0.05). Having more mixed GGO with consolidation, pleural effusion, lack of pure GGO, more diffuse opacity, involvement of more than 2 lobes and high opacity score identified as independent risk factors of critical and death groups. CONCLUSION: CT images of non-critical, critical and death groups with COVID-19 had definite characteristics. CT examination plays a vital role in managing the current COVID-19 outbreak, for early detection of COVID-19 pneumonia. In addition, initial CT findings may be useful to stratify patients, which have a potentially important utility in the current global medical situation.","Ashtari, S; Vahedian-Azimi, A; Shojaee, S; Pourhoseingholi, M A; Jafari, R; Bashar, F R; Zali, M R",Radiologia,157,32

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of COVID-19, infects gastrointestinal epithelial cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors triggering a cascade of events leading to mucosal and systemic inflammation. Symptomatic patients display changes in gut microbiota composition and function which may contribute to intestinal barrier dysfunction and immune activation. Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection and related mucosal inflammation impact on the function of the enteric nervous system and the activation of sensory fibers conveying information to the central nervous system, which, may at least in part, contribute symptom generation such as vomiting and diarrhea described in COVID-19. Liver and pancreas dysfunctions have also been described as non-respiratory complications of COVID-19 and add further emphasis to the common view of SARS-CoV-2 infection as a systemic disease with multiorgan involvement. PURPOSE: The aim of this review was to highlight the current knowledge on the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the crosstalk with the gut microbiota, the fecal-oral route of virus transmission, and the potential interaction of the virus with the enteric nervous system. We also review the current available data on gastrointestinal and liver manifestations, management, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19.","Marasco, Giovanni; Lenti, Marco Vincenzo; Cremon, Cesare; Barbaro, Maria Raffaella; Stanghellini, Vincenzo; Di Sabatino, Antonio; Barbara, Giovanni",Neurogastroenterol Motil,157,29

Assessing cities' long term trends remains challenging. The first part of this chapter describes the short-run dynamics of the housing market in 2020. Evidence from prices and price-to-rent ratios suggests expectations of resilience. Zip-level evidence suggests a short-run trend towards suburbanization, and some impacts of urban protests on house prices. The second part of the chapter analyzes the long-run dynamics of urban growth between 1970 and 2010. It analyzes what, in such urban growth, is explained by short-run shocks as opposed to fundamentals such as education, industrial specialization, industrial diversification, urban segregation, and housing supply elasticity. This chapter's original results as well as a large established body of literature suggest that fundamentals are the key drivers of growth. The chapter illustrates this finding with two case studies: the New York City housing market after September 11, 2001; and the San Francisco Bay Area in the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Both areas rebounded strongly after these shocks, suggesting the resilience of the urban metropolis.","Ouazad, Amine",,157,22

The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and human transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) are essential for the host cell-mediated viral entry. Targeting these proteins represent viable options to stop the first stage of infection and transmission. Hence, 97 alkaloids from African medicinal plants with reported antiviral activity were evaluated for this purpose via in silico studies. These alkaloids were docked for their interactions with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, ACE2, and TMPRSS2. Top 20 alkaloids with highest binding affinities were further screened for their interactions with spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and with ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain complex (ACE2-RBD). The energy profiling, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS), binding free energy base on Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MMGBSA), clustering of MDS trajectories, and virtual physicochemical and pharmacokinetic screening of the best docked alkaloids were performed. Results revealed that more than 15 alkaloids interacted better than the reference compounds. 10-Hydroxyusambarensine and Cryptospirolepine were docked in a similar binding pattern to the S1-specificy pocket of TMPRSS2 as camostat (reference inhibitor). The strong binding affinities, stability of the alkaloid-protein complexes and amino acid interactions displayed by cryptospirolepine, 10-hydroxyusambarensine, and cryptoquindoline with important binding hotspots of the proteins suggest these alkaloids have the potential of altering the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 membrane mediated host cell entry.

Observational studies so far have lacked rigorous ascertainment adjustment and international generalisability. We aimed to determine whether use of ACEIs or ARBs is associated with an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with hypertension. METHODS: In this international, open science, cohort analysis, we used electronic health records from Spain (Information Systems for Research in Primary Care [SIDIAP]) and the USA (Columbia University Irving Medical Center data warehouse [CUIMC] and Department of Veterans Affairs Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership [VA-OMOP]) to identify patients aged 18 years or older with at least one prescription for ACEIs and ARBs (target cohort) or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics (THZs; comparator cohort) between Nov 1, 2019, and Jan 31, 2020. Users were defined separately as receiving either monotherapy with these four drug classes, or monotherapy or combination therapy (combination use) with other antihypertensive medications. We assessed four outcomes: COVID-19 diagnosis; hospital admission with COVID-19; hospital admission with pneumonia; and hospital admission with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, or sepsis. We built large-scale propensity score methods derived through a data-driven approach and negative control experiments across ten pairwise comparisons, with results meta-analysed to generate 1280 study effects. For each study effect, we did negative control outcome experiments using a possible 123 controls identified through a data-rich algorithm. This process used a set of predefined baseline patient characteristics to provide the most accurate prediction of treatment and balance among patient cohorts across characteristics. The study is registered with the EU Post-Authorisation Studies register, EUPAS35296. FINDINGS: Among 1â355â349 antihypertensive users (363â785 ACEI or ARB monotherapy users, 248â915 CCB or THZ monotherapy users, 711â799 ACEI or ARB combination users, and 473â076 CCB or THZ combination users) included in analyses, no association was observed between COVID-19 diagnosis and exposure to ACEI or ARB monotherapy versus CCB or THZ monotherapy (calibrated hazard ratio [HR] 0·98, 95% CI 0·84-1·14) or combination use exposure (1·01, 0·90-1·15). ACEIs alone similarly showed no relative risk difference when compared with CCB or THZ monotherapy (HR 0·91, 95% CI 0·68-1·21; with heterogeneity of >40%) or combination use (0·95, 0·83-1·07). Directly comparing ACEIs with ARBs demonstrated a moderately lower risk with ACEIs, which was significant with combination use (HR 0·88, 95% CI 0·79-0·99) and non-significant for monotherapy (0·85, 0·69-1·05). We observed no significant difference between drug classes for risk of hospital admission with COVID-19, hospital admission with pneumonia, or hospital admission with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, or sepsis across all comparisons. INTERPRETATION: No clinically significant increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis or hospital admission-related outcomes associated with ACEI or ARB use was observed, suggesting users should not discontinue or change their treatment to decrease their risk of COVID-19.

The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes among confirmed COVID-19 cases who were managed at three settings: two outpatient settings and one inpatient. METHODS: A retrospective database cohort study was conducted in a large Israeli Health Maintenance Organization. All COVID-19 cases diagnosed between 28 February 2020 and 20 July 2020 were included. Cases in the community settings were managed through a nationwide remote monitoring center, using preliminary telehealth triage and 24/7 virtual care. Outcome parameters included hospital admission, disease severity, need for respiratory support and mortality. RESULTS: About 5448 cases, aged range 0-97 years, were enrolled; 88.7% were initially managed as outpatient either at home or in designated hotels, 3.1 and 2.1% of them, respectively, later required hospitalization. The main reason for hospitalization was dyspnea; 12 were diagnosed with severe disease; 56 patients (1.3%) died, five (0.1%) of whom were initially allocated to the outpatient settings. CONCLUSIONS: Care for appropriately selected COVID-19 patients in the community provides a safe and effective option. This can contribute to reducing the hospitalization burden, with no evidence of increased morbidity or mortality.","Shapiro Ben David, Shirley; Cohen, Daniella; Karplus, Rebekah; Irony, Angela; Ofer-Bialer, Gili; Potasman, Israel; Greenfeld, Orly; Azuri, Joseph; Ash, Nachman",J. public health (Oxf),157,11

We use mixed-effects models to analyze the data. RESULTS: Social isolation (distancing) significantly predicts poor mental health operationalized as coronavirus-induced distress (p < 0.01). At the aggregate level, average distress varies positively across countries with higher numbers of coronavirus-related deaths (p < 0.10) and more fragile state capacity (p < 0.05), while varying negatively across those with more stringent anti-coronavirus policies (p < 0.05). Finally, we report several cross-level interactions between social isolation and the total number of deaths (p = 0.025), policy stringency (p =0.065), state fragility (p = 0.061), and globalization index (p = 0.071).

The incidence of COVID-19 has also been higher in males compared with their female counterparts. This trend could be attributed to a better responsive and robust immune system in females. Cytokine storm is one of the pathophysiological features of severe COVID-19, and it occurs as a result of over-activation of immune cells leading to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Nevertheless, it is well modulated in females compared to their male counterparts. Severe inflammation in males is reported to facilitate progression of mild to severe COVID-19. The sex hormones, estrogens and androgens which exist in varying functional levels respectively in females and males are cited as the underlying cause for the differential immune response to COVID-19. Evidence abounds that estrogen modulate the immune system to protect females from severe inflammation and for that matter severe COVID-19. On the contrary, androgen has been implicated in over-activation of immune cells, cytokine storm and the attendant severe inflammation, which perhaps predispose males to severe COVID-19.

Utilizing more advanced technology including video communication, although available, was generally underutilized until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth presents the opportunity to bridge many divides including geographical and logistical challenges. Many acute pediatric conditions can be managed safely and effectively through telehealth especially when remote physical exam equipment is used. Telehealth can also be especially useful in medical care of children with medical complexity. Traveling with medical equipment to multiple subspecialists can be incredibly challenging and often a similar quality visit can be conducted through telehealth in the comfort of a child's home environment. Well child care presents a unique problem while trying to maintain social distancing. Integrating a hybrid model using both an in-person exam and history through video conferencing can help balance limited face to face time with the need to ensure a full and appropriate physical exam.

We have assessed the performance of serum apolipoprotein-A1, the main transporter of HDL-cholesterol, to identify the early spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in the general population and its diagnostic performance for the Covid-19. METHODS: We compared the daily mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 during the first 34 weeks of 2020 in a population that is routinely followed for a risk of liver fibrosis risk in the USA (212,297 serum) and in France (20,652 serum) in relation to a local increase in confirmed cases, and in comparison to the same period in 2019 (266,976 and 28,452 serum, respectively). We prospectively assessed the sensitivity of this marker in an observational study of 136 consecutive hospitalized cases and retrospectively evaluated its specificity in 7,481 controls representing the general population. RESULTS: The mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 levels in the survey populations began decreasing in January 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was highly correlated with the daily increase in confirmed Covid-19 cases in the following 34 weeks, both in France and USA, including the June and mid-July recovery periods in France. Apolipoprotein-A1 at the 1.25 g/L cutoff had a sensitivity of 90.6% (95%CI84.2-95.1) and a specificity of 96.1% (95.7-96.6%) for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The area under the characteristics curve was 0.978 (0.957-0.988), and outperformed haptoglobin and liver function tests. The adjusted risk ratio of apolipoprotein-A1 for survival without transfer to intensive care unit was 5.61 (95%CI 1.02-31.0; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Apolipoprotein-A1 could be a sentinel of the pandemic in existing routine surveillance of the general population.

The single components that belong to the three main modules of the PN are highly interconnected and can be considered as part of a single giant network. Several pharmacological strategies have been proposed to ameliorate neurodegeneration by targeting PN components. Nevertheless, effective disease-modifying therapies are still lacking. In this review article, after a general description of the PN and its failure in proteinopathies, we will focus on the available pharmacological tools to target proteostasis.

As a result, pericarditis and pericardial effusion may occur with or without COVID-19 related respiratory signs. Due to limitations in sensitivity and specificity of current COVID-19 diagnostic studies, cases that trigger high clinical intuition, even with negative serologic and polymerase chain reaction testing results, may necessitate further diagnostic workup to discover the underlying etiology. PATIENT CONCERNS: Here we present a rare case of pericardial effusion in the setting of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection manifesting with the chief complaint of chest pain. DIAGNOSIS: While undergoing diagnostic workup, the patients first 2 sets of COVID 19 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were negative while a latter RT-PCR test, as well as serology, were positive, leading to the diagnosis of COVID-19 reinfection or subacute presentation of viral infection with pericardial effusion. Echocardiogram depicted large circumferential pericardial effusion with mildly thickened pericardium. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent pericardial window placement followed by ibuprofen administration and discharged from the hospital. OUTCOMES: During the follow-up visit patient had no symptoms and echocardiogram demonstrated complete resolution of the effusion. LESSONS: Due to the possible establishment of pericardial effusions and consecutively tamponade even without any COVID-19 related clinical presentation, it is crucial for clinicians to trust their intuition, conduct the appropriate diagnostic tests, find the underlying diagnosis and prevent the devastating consequences.","Amoozgar, Behzad; Kaushal, Varun; Mubashar, Umair; Sen, Shuvendu; Yousaf, Shakeel; Yotsuya, Matthew",Medicine (Baltimore),157,16

Disease transmission models and the epidemic forecasts at the national level steer the policy to implement appropriate intervention strategies and budgeting. However, it is critical to design a data-driven reliable model for nowcasting for smaller populations, in particular metro cities. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze the transition of the epidemic from subexponential to exponential transmission in the Chennai metro zone and to analyze the probability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) secondary infections while availing the public transport systems in the city. METHODS: A single geographical zone ""Chennai-Metro-Merge"" was constructed by combining Chennai District with three bordering districts. Subexponential and exponential models were developed to analyze and predict the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic. Probabilistic models were applied to assess the probability of secondary infections while availing public transport after the release of the lockdown. RESULTS: The model predicted that transition from subexponential to exponential transmission occurs around the eighth week after the reporting of a cluster of cases. The probability of secondary infections with a single index case in an enclosure of the city bus, the suburban train general coach, and the ladies coach was found to be 0.192, 0.074, and 0.114, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Nowcasting at the early stage of the epidemic predicts the probable time point of the exponential transmission and alerts the public health system. After the lockdown release, public transportation will be the major source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in metro cities, and appropriate strategies based on nowcasting are needed.","Krishnamurthy, Kamalanand; Ambikapathy, Bakiya; Kumar, Ashwani; Britto, Lourduraj De",JMIR Public Health Surveill,157,24

Achieving optimal nutritional treatment during these phases in critically ill patients is challenging. COVID-19 patients seem particularly difficult to feed due to gastrointestinal problems. Our aim was to describe measured resting energy expenditure (mREE) and feeding practices and tolerance during the acute and late phases of critical illness in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Observational study including critically ill mechanically ventilated adult COVID-19 patients. Indirect calorimetry (Q-NRG+, Cosmed) was used to determine mREE during the acute (day 0-7) and late phase (>day 7) of critical illness. Data on nutritional intake, feeding tolerance and urinary nitrogen loss were collected simultaneously. A paired sample t-test was performed for mREE in both phases. RESULTS: We enrolled 21 patients with a median age of 59 years [44-66], 67% male and median BMI of 31.5 kg/m2 [25.7-37.8]. Patients were predominantly fed with EN in both phases. No significant difference in mREE was observed between phases (p = 0.529). Sixty-five percent of the patients were hypermetabolic in both phases. Median delivery of energy as percentage of mREE was higher in the late phase (94%) compared to the acute phase (70%) (p = 0.001). Urinary nitrogen losses were significant higher in the late phase (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: In both the acute and late phase, the majority of the patients were hypermetabolic and fed enterally. In the acute phase patients were fed hypocaloric whereas in the late phase this was almost normocaloric, conform ESPEN guidelines. No significant difference in mREE was observed between phases. Hypermetabolism in both phases in conjunction with an increasing loss of urinary nitrogen may indicate that COVID-19 patients remain in a prolonged acute, catabolic phase.","Lakenman, P L M; van der Hoven, B; Schuijs, J M; Eveleens, R D; van Bommel, J; Olieman, J F; Joosten, K F M",Clin Nutr ESPEN,157,1

The first senolytic drugs Dasatinib, Quercetin, Fisetin and Navitoclax were discovered using a hypothesis-driven approach. SC accumulate with ageing and at causal sites of multiple chronic disorders, including diseases accounting for the bulk of morbidity, mortality and health expenditures. The most deleterious SC are resistant to apoptosis and have up-regulation of anti-apoptotic pathways which defend SC against their own inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), allowing them to survive, despite killing neighbouring cells. Senolytics transiently disable these SCAPs, causing apoptosis of those SC with a tissue-destructive SASP. Because SC take weeks to reaccumulate, senolytics can be administered intermittently - a 'hit-and-run' approach. In preclinical models, senolytics delay, prevent or alleviate frailty, cancers and cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, liver, kidney, musculoskeletal, lung, eye, haematological, metabolic and skin disorders as well as complications of organ transplantation, radiation and cancer treatment. As anticipated for agents targeting the fundamental ageing mechanisms that are 'root cause' contributors to multiple disorders, potential uses of senolytics are protean, potentially alleviating over 40 conditions in preclinical studies, opening a new route for treating age-related dysfunction and diseases. Early pilot trials of senolytics suggest they decrease senescent cells, reduce inflammation and alleviate frailty in humans. Clinical trials for diabetes, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease, COVID-19, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, eye diseases and bone marrow transplant and childhood cancer survivors are underway or beginning. Until such studies are done, it is too early for senolytics to be used outside of clinical trials.","Kirkland, J L; Tchkonia, T",J Intern Med,157,20

METHODS: The standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) were applied to estimate pooled results from six studies. The prognostic performance of vitamin D serum levels for predicting adverse outcomes with detection of the best cutoff threshold was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Decision tree analysis by combining vitamin D levels and clinical features was applied to predict severity in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Mean vitamin D serum level of 376 patients, was 21.9 nmol/L (95% CI = 15.36-28.45). Significant heterogeneity was found (I2 = 99.1%, p < .001).

In an online questionnaire, administered in 11 countries (Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the UK, and USA, N = 5,619), participants rated the relevance of wellbeing goals during the pandemic, and the effectiveness of different activities in obtaining these goals. Music was found to be the most effective activity for three out of five wellbeing goals: enjoyment, venting negative emotions, and self-connection. For diversion, music was equally good as entertainment, while it was second best to create a sense of togetherness, after socialization. This result was evident across different countries and gender, with minor effects of age on specific goals, and a clear effect of the importance of music in people's lives. Cultural effects were generally small and surfaced mainly in the use of music to obtain a sense of togetherness. Interestingly, culture moderated the use of negatively valenced and nostalgic music for those higher in distress.","Granot, R.; Spitz, D. H.; Cherki, B. R.; Loui, P.; Timmers, R.; Schaefer, R.

Although the stay-at-home order was one of the most effective methods to contain its spread, residents in lower-income neighborhoods faced barriers to practicing social distancing. We aimed to quantify the differential impact of stay-at-home policy on COVID-19 transmission and residents' mobility across neighborhoods of different levels of socioeconomic disadvantage. METHODS: This was a comparative interrupted time-series analysis at the county level. We included 2087 counties from 38 states which both implemented and lifted the state-wide stay-at-home order. Every county was assigned to one of four equally-sized groups based on its levels of disadvantage, represented by the Area Deprivation Index. Prevalence of COVID-19 was calculated by dividing the daily number of cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases by the number of residents from the 2010 Census. We used the Social Distancing Index (SDI), derived from the COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform, to measure the mobility. For the evaluation of implementation, the observation started from Mar 1st 2020 to 1 day before lifting; and, for lifting, it ranged from 1 day after implementation to Jul 5th 2020. We calculated a comparative change of daily trends in COVID-19 prevalence and Social Distancing Index between counties with three highest disadvantage levels and those with the least level before and after the implementation and lifting of the stay-at-home order, separately. RESULTS: On both stay-at-home implementation and lifting dates, COVID-19 prevalence was much higher among counties with the highest or lowest disadvantage level, while mobility decreased as the disadvantage level increased. Mobility of the most disadvantaged counties was least impacted by stay-at-home implementation and relaxation compared to counties with the most resources; however, disadvantaged counties experienced the largest relative increase in COVID-19 infection after both stay-at-home implementation and relaxation. CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhoods with varying levels of socioeconomic disadvantage reacted differently to the implementation and relaxation of COVID-19 mitigation policies. Policymakers should consider investing more resources in disadvantaged counties as the pandemic may not stop until most neighborhoods have it under control.","Chang, Hsien-Yen; Tang, Wenze; Hatef, Elham; Kitchen, Christopher; Weiner, Jonathan P; Kharrazi, Hadi",BMC Public Health,157,33

We sought to evaluate long-term impact of CRT in a single-center cohort of patients with congenital heart disease. Methods and Results Thirty-two consecutive patients with structural congenital heart disease (N=30) or congenital atrioventricular block (N=2), aged median of 12.9 years at CRT with pacing capability device implantation, were followed up for a median of 8.7 years. CRT response was defined as an increase in systemic ventricular ejection fraction or fractional area of change by >10 units and improved or unchanged New York Heart Association class. Freedom from cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, or new transplant listing was 92.6% and 83.2% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Freedom from CRT complications, leading to surgical system revision (elective generator replacement excluded) or therapy termination, was 82.7% and 72.2% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. The overall probability of an uneventful therapy continuation was 76.3% and 58.8% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. There was a significant increase in ejection fraction/fractional area of change (P<0.001) mainly attributable to patients with systemic left ventricle (P=0.002) and decrease in systemic ventricular end-diastolic dimensions (P<0.05) after CRT. New York Heart Association functional class improved from a median 2.0 to 1.25 (P<0.001). Long-term CRT response was present in 54.8% of patients at last follow-up and was more frequent in systemic left ventricle (P<0.001). Conclusions CRT in patients with congenital heart disease was associated with acceptable survival and long-term response in &#8776;50% of patients.

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from individuals without symptoms contributes to pandemic spread, but the extent of transmission from persistently asymptomatic individuals remains unknown. We describe three methodological issues that hinder attempts to estimate this proportion. First, incomplete symptom assessment probably overestimates the asymptomatic fraction. Second, studies with inadequate follow-up misclassify pre-symptomatic individuals. Third, serological studies might identify people with previously unrecognised infection, but reliance on poorly defined antibody responses and retrospective symptom assessment might result in misclassification. We provide recommendations regarding definitions, detection, documentation, and follow-up to improve the identification and evaluation of people with persistently asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and their contacts. Accurate characterisation of the persistently asymptomatic fraction of infected individuals might shed light on COVID-19 pathogenesis and transmission dynamics, and inform public health responses.","Meyerowitz, Eric A; Richterman, Aaron; Bogoch, Isaac I; Low, Nicola; Cevik, Muge","Lancet, Infect. dis.

Prior to the development of specific drug therapies or a vaccine, more immediately available treatments were sought including convalescent plasma. A potential improvement from convalescent plasma could be the preparation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (hIVIG). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Convalescent plasma was collected from an existing network of plasma donation centers. A caprylate/chromatography purification process was used to manufacture hIVIG. Initial batches of hIVIG were manufactured in a versatile, small-scale facility designed and built to rapidly address emerging infectious diseases. RESULTS: Processing convalescent plasma into hIVIG resulted in a highly purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) product with more concentrated neutralizing antibody activity. hIVIG will allow for the administration of greater antibody activity per unit of volume with decreased potential for several adverse events associated with plasma administration. IgG concentration and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 were increased over 10-fold from convalescent plasma to the final product. Normalized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay activity (per mg/ml IgG) was maintained throughout the process. Protein content in these final product batches was 100% IgG, consisting of 98% monomer and dimer forms. Potentially hazardous proteins (IgM, IgA, and anti-A, anti-B, and anti-D) were reduced to minimal levels. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple batches of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hIVIG that met regulatory requirements were manufactured from human convalescent plasma. The first clinical study in which the hIVIG will be evaluated will be Inpatient Treatment with Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin (ITAC) [NCT04546581].","Vandeberg, Peter; Cruz, Maria; Diez, Jose Maria; Merritt, W Keither; Santos, Benjamin; Trukawinski, Susan; Wellhouse, Andrea; Jose, Marta; Willis, Todd",Transfusion,157,16

As we can see in [1] a generalized logistic equation captures both the peaks of the total infected and the deaths. In this article our goal is to study the missing peak, i.e. the currently infected one (or total currently positive). After the April 7 the large increase in the number of swabs meant that the logistical behavior of the infected curve no longer worked. So we decided to generalize the model, introducing new parameters. Moreover, we adopt a similar approach used in [1] (for the estimation of deaths) in order to evaluate the recoveries. In this way, introducing a simple conservation law, we define a model with 4 populations: total infected, currently positives, recoveries and deaths. Therefore, we propose an alternative method to a classical SIRD model for the evaluation of the Sars-Cov-2 epidemic. However, the method is general and thus applicable to other diseases. Finally we study the behavior of the ratio infected over swabs for Italy, Germany and USA, and we show as studying this parameter we recover the generalized Logistic model used in [1] for these three countries.

Where some countries can respond to the situation by ordering more high-end ventilators, the price is often too high for low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) and securing them can be difficult. The goal of this work is to design, prototype, and test a low-cost ventilator, called ETH breathe, based on the automated compression of a resuscitator bag. A holistic and systematic design approach is taken to create a compact and adaptable device that can safely meet the current requirements. This is achieved by using 72% standard parts out of 33 (72%) and prioritizing compactness in the mechanical design. The control system is developed to provide both continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) and spontaneous breathing support or assist control (AC), which significantly extends the potential use cases beyond patient sedation. The prototype is tested for accuracy, modularity, and oxygen response using a full physiological artificial lung. The results show for the first time in literature that the design operates within the defined requirements, based on emergency government regulations, and can be used with different sizes of resuscitator bags and different positions of the flow sensor.

Primary LFs were isolated and treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF, 20 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of an ERK inhibitor, PD98059 (10 µmol/L). Phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) protein levels were determined using immunocytochemistry, western blotting, and real-time reverse transcription quantitative (RT-q)PCR. LF proliferation was examined by flow cytometry and a cell counting kit-8 assay. LF transdifferentiation was examined by protein and mRNA expression of &#945;-smooth muscle actin (&#945;-SMA) by immunocytochemistry, western blotting, and RT-qPCR. LF migration was examined by the transwell method. Results: Phosphorylated ERK1/2, which was activated by EGF, promoted LF proliferation by accelerating cell-cycle progression from the G1 to S phase. After treatment with PD98059, the expression of p-ERK1/2 in LFs, cellular proliferation, and the percentage of cells in S phase were significantly decreased. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 also promoted the differentiation of LFs into myofibroblasts through increased &#945;-SMA synthesis and migration.

Recent observational studies suggest that extratropical-tropical coupling between the KE and the central tropical Pacific El Niño Southern Oscillation (CP-ENSO) leads to the observed preferred decadal time-scale of Pacific climate variability. By combining reanalysis data with numerical simulations from a high-resolution climate model and a linear inverse model (LIM), we confirm that KE and CP-ENSO dynamics are linked through extratropical-tropical teleconnections. Specifically, the atmospheric response to the KE excites Meridional Modes that energize the CP-ENSO (extratropicstropics), and in turn, CP-ENSO teleconnections energize the extratropical atmospheric forcing of the KE (tropicsextratropics). However, both observations and the model show that the KE/CP-ENSO coupling is non-stationary and has intensified in recent decades after the mid-1980. Given the short length of the observational and climate model record, it is difficult to attribute this shift to anthropogenic forcing. However, using a large-ensemble of the LIM we show that the intensification in the KE/CP-ENSO coupling after the mid-1980 is significant and linked to changes in the KE atmospheric downstream response, which exhibit a stronger imprint on the subtropical winds that excite the Pacific Meridional modes and CP-ENSO.","Joh, Youngji; Di Lorenzo, Emanuele; Siqueira, Leo; Kirtman, Benjamin P",Sci Rep,157,20

All publicly available (n = 115; GISAID database) whole-genome SARS-Cov-2 sequences from Polish samples, including those obtained during coronavirus testing performed in our COVID-19 Lab, were examined. Multiple sequence alignment of Polish isolates, phylogenetic analysis (ML tree), and multidimensional scaling (based on the pairwise DNA distances) were complemented by the comparison of the coronavirus clades frequency and diversity in the subset of over 5000 European GISAID sequences. Approximately seventy-seven percent of isolates in the European dataset carried frequent and ubiquitously found haplotypes; the remaining haplotype diversity was population-specific and resulted from population-specific mutations, homoplasies, and recombinations. Coronavirus strains circulating in Poland represented the variability found in other European countries. The prevalence of clades circulating in Poland was shifted in favor of GR, both in terms of the diversity (number of distinct haplotypes) and the frequency (number of isolates) of the clade. Polish-specific haplotypes were rare and could be explained by changes affecting common European strains. The analysis of the whole viral genomes allowed detection of several tight clusters of isolates, presumably reflecting local outbreaks. New mutations, homoplasies, and, to a smaller extent, recombinations increase SARS-CoV-2 haplotype diversity, but the majority of these variants do not increase in frequency and remains rare and population-specific. The spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes in the Polish dataset reflects many independent transfers from a variety of sources, followed by many local outbreaks. The prevalence of the sequences belonging to the GR clade among Polish isolates is consistent with the European trend of the GR clade frequency increase.","Hryhorowicz, Szymon; Ustaszewski, Adam; Kaczmarek-Rys, Marta; Lis, Emilia; Witt, Michal; Plawski, Andrzej; Zietkiewicz, Ewa",J. appl. genet,157,10

Objective: To evaluate the association between HCW status and outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective, observational cohort study included consecutive adult patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 across 36 North American centers from April 15 to June 5, 2020. Data were collected from 1992 patients. Data were analyzed from September 10 to October 1, 2020. Exposures: Data on patient baseline characteristics, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, treatments, and outcomes were collected, including HCW status. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a requirement for mechanical ventilation or death. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to yield adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% CIs for the association between HCW status and COVID-19-related outcomes in a 3:1 propensity score-matched cohort, adjusting for residual confounding after matching. Results: In total, 1790 patients were included, comprising 127 HCWs and 1663 non-HCWs. After 3:1 propensity score matching, 122 HCWs were matched to 366 non-HCWs. Women comprised 71 (58.2%) of matched HCWs and 214 (58.5%) of matched non-HCWs. Matched HCWs had a mean (SD) age of 52 (13) years, whereas matched non-HCWs had a mean (SD) age of 57 (17) years. In the matched cohort, the odds of the primary outcome, mechanical ventilation or death, were not significantly different for HCWs compared with non-HCWs (AOR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.34-1.04). The HCWs were less likely to require admission to an intensive care unit (AOR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34-0.92) and were also less likely to require an admission of 7 days or longer (AOR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.34-0.83). There were no differences between matched HCWs and non-HCWs in terms of mechanical ventilation (AOR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.37-1.17), death (AOR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.18-1.27), or vasopressor requirements (AOR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.37-1.24). Conclusions and Relevance: In this propensity score-matched multicenter cohort study, HCW status was not associated with poorer outcomes among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and, in fact, was associated with a shorter length of hospitalization and decreased likelihood of intensive care unit admission. Further research is needed to elucidate the proportion of HCW infections acquired in the workplace and to assess whether HCW type is associated with outcomes.","Yang, Jeong Yun; Parkins, Michael D; Canakis, Andrew; Aroniadis, Olga C; Yadav, Dhiraj; Dixon, Rebekah E; Elmunzer, B Joseph; Forbes, Nauzer",JAMA Netw Open,157,20

During the 2020 pandemic, school closures have posed additional challenges to educators seeking to engage learners and provide egalitarian access to learning opportunities. Approach: This case study documents a collaborative materials design process when the COVID-19 pandemic forced Chilean schools into remote lessons for a whole school year. The collaboration was based on a small professional learning network consisting of two pre-service teachers and two teacher educators. Two questions were posed: What learning and circumstantial needs had to be considered for materials design and for the process of making the materials accessible to a diverse group of Year-9 EFL learners? What were the benefits and challenges for this networked learning system when searching for solutions? Findings: The combination of different access modes to materials, including paper-based worksheets and social networking, and the provision of internet access to facilitate video conferences, helped to overcome some but not all of the limitations caused by the lack of political commitment to offer solutions at a macro level. Based on a framework that combined principles of Differentiated Instruction, Universal Design for Learning, multimodality and bilingual support, the team developed materials at an appropriate level for most students. However, difficulties regarding differentiation between different learner levels persisted. Value: This study sheds light on the affordances and challenges of a collaborative materials design process in which educators join perspectives to provide materials for greater educational justice in FL classrooms. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Glas, K.; Catalán, E.; Donner, M.; Donoso, C.",Innovation in Language Learning and Teaching,157,1

This study aimed to investigate the role of dengue non-structural 1 (NS1) protein and host factors contributing to severe dengue. Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing system was used to investigate the changes in barrier function of microvascular endothelial cells treated NS1 protein and serum samples from patients with different disease severity. Cytokines and metabolites profiles were assessed using a multiplex cytokine assay and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry respectively. The findings showed that NS1 was able to induce the loss of barrier function in microvascular endothelium in a dose dependent manner, however, the level of NS1 in serum samples did not correlate with the extent of vascular leakage induced. Further assessment of host factors revealed that cytokines such as CCL2, CCL5, CCL20 and CXCL1, as well as adhesion molecule ICAM-1, that are involved in leukocytes infiltration were expressed higher in dengue patients in comparison to healthy individuals. In addition, metabolomics study revealed the presence of deregulated metabolites involved in the phospholipid metabolism pathway in patients with severe manifestations. In conclusion, disease severity in dengue virus infection did not correlate directly with NS1 level, but instead with host factors that are involved in the regulation of junctional integrity and phospholipid metabolism. However, as the studied population was relatively small in this study, these exploratory findings should be confirmed by expanding the sample size using an independent cohort to further establish the significance of this study.","Soe, Hui Jen; Manikam, Rishya; Raju, Chandramathi Samudi; Khan, Mohammad Asif; Sekaran, Shamala Devi",PLoS One,157,20

The objective of this systematic review was to assess currently published literature relating to the management, clinical course, and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver, kidney, and heart solid organ transplant recipients. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to assess currently published literature relating to the management, clinical course, and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver, kidney, and heart solid organ transplant recipients. Articles published through June 2020 were searched in the MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and PubMed databases. We identified 49 eligible studies comprising a total of 403 solid organ transplant recipients. RESULTS: Older age, male sex, and preexisting comorbidities, including hypertension and/or diabetes, were the most common prevailing characteristics among the solid organ transplant recipients. Clinical presentation ranged from mild to severe disease, including multiorgan failure and death. We found an overall mortality rate of 21%. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests no increase in overall mortality or worse outcome in solid organ transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy compared with mortality in the general surgical population with SARS-CoV-2. Our findings suggest that transplant surgery and its immunosuppressive effects should not be a deterrent to proper surgical care for patients in the SARS-CoV-2 era.","Aziz, Hassan; Lashkari, Nassim; Yoon, Young Chul; Kim, Jim; Sher, Linda S; Genyk, Yuri; Kwon, Yong K",Transplant Proc,157,16

OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the incidence of hospitalization and death for COVID-19 in a large sample of patients with plaque psoriasis receiving biologic therapies compared with the general population. METHODS: This is a retrospective multicenter cohort study including patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (n = 6501) being treated with biologic therapy and regularly followed up at the divisions of dermatology of several main hospitals in the Northern Italian cities of Verona, Padua, Vicenza, Modena, Bologna, Piacenza, Turin, and Milan.

This study sought to understand the impact of the pandemic on older adults in alcohol treatment, and to explore how changes in the provision of alcohol treatment were experienced. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were completed with older adults (aged 55+) in alcohol treatment, as well as alcohol practitioners providing support to older adults. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Alcohol use was assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption (AUDIT-C). RESULTS: Thirty older adults in alcohol treatment and fifteen alcohol practitioners were recruited. The COVID-19 pandemic was found to result in both increases and decreases in alcohol use;changes in alcohol use depended on a number of factors, such as living arrangements, family support, physical and mental health. Many alcohol treatment services moved to a model of remote support during the pandemic. However, face-to-face service provision was considered to be essential by both older adults in alcohol treatment and alcohol practitioners. Engagement with online support was low, with older adults facing barriers in using online technology. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the importance of face-to-face treatment and intervention for older adults in alcohol treatment. Addiction services may see increased demand for treatment as a result of the pandemic;it is important that services consider the needs of older adults, many of whom may be marginalised by a remote model of service provision.","Seddon, J.; Trevena, P.; Wadd, S.; Elliott, L.; Dutton, M.; McCann, M.; Willmott, S.",Aging &amp; Mental Health,157,16

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Between March and April 2020, 247 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 were included and compared with a historical cohort of 108 severe septic patients. Nonsevere coronavirus disease 2019 patients (n = 153) presented normal or slightly altered immune profiles. Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (n = 94) immune profile differed from sepsis. Coronavirus disease 2019 exhibited profound and prolonged lymphopenia (mostly on CD3, CD4, CD8, and NK cells), neutrophilia, and human leukocyte antigen D receptor expression on CD14+ monocytes down-regulation. Surprisingly, coronavirus disease 2019 patients presented a unique profile of B cells expansion, basophilia, and eosinophilia. Lymphopenia, human leukocyte antigen D receptor expression on CD14+ monocytes down-regulation, and neutrophilia were associated with a worsened outcome, whereas basophilia and eosinophilia were associated with survival. Circulating immune cell kinetics differed between severe coronavirus disease 2019 and sepsis, lack of correction of immune alterations in coronavirus disease 2019 patients during the first 2 weeks of ICU admission was associated with death and nosocomial infections. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating immune cells profile differs between mild and severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Severe coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a unique immune profile as compared with sepsis. Several immune features are associated with outcome. Thus, immune monitoring of coronavirus disease 2019 might be of help for patient management.","de Roquetaillade, Charles; Mansouri, Sehmi; Brumpt, Caren; Neuwirth, Marie; Voicu, Sebastian; Le Dorze, Matthieu; Fontaine, Candice; Barthelemy, Romain; Gayat, Etienne; Megarbane, Bruno; Mebazaa, Alexandre; Chousterman, Benjamin Glenn",Crit. care med,157,16

CASE REPORT: Clinical and radiographic data were obtained from the electronic medical record. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained and evaluated for COVID-19 by the Food and Drug Administration-approved reverse transcription-PCR assays. On radiographic examination, PET/CT was consistent with COVID-19-related pneumonia not seen on prior imaging. Initial nasopharyngeal swab 2 days after PET/CT imaging was negative for COVID-19. Subsequent repeat swab 10 days later was positive for COVID-19, while the patient was febrile on screening assessment. The patient remained COVID-19-positive until 1 month after abnormal PET/CT imaging. CONCLUSION: PET/CT can be sensitive for early COVID-19 detection, even in the setting of a negative confirmatory PCR test. This highlights the importance of continued patient surveillance and use of appropriate personal protective equipment to minimize COVID-19 transmission.","Mo, Allen; Brodin, N Patrik; Tomé, Wolfgang A; Garg, Madhur K; Kabarriti, Rafi",In Vivo,157,24

Hourly electricity demand data was collected and analyzed for the province of Ontario. It is evident that health-related pandemics have a detrimental and direct influence on the concept of the smart city. This is manifested through various social, economic, environmental, technological and energy-related changes. The overall electricity demand of the province for the month of April of this year amidst pandemic conditions declined by 14%, totaling 1267 GW. A unique trend of reciprocating energy demand exists throughout the week. The post-COVID-19 indicates higher energy demand in the earlier part of the week and a lower demand in the latter part of the week. Pre-pandemic, the days of highest electricity demand were in the latter part of the work week (Wed-Fri) in addition to the weekend. Post-pandemic, the highest electricity demand occurred in the earlier part of the week (Mon-Tue). Hourly electricity demand shows a clear curve flattening during the pandemic, especially during peak hours of 7–11 in the morning and 5–7 in the evening, resulting in significant demand reductions during these periods.

Therefore, in order to dwell deeper into the measures taken by the policy makers around the world, this paper specifically analyzes how the monetary policies have been devised, in response to COVID-19. For this purpose, this paper has taken into consideration a panel of 8 Asian economies that have been affected the most acutely by the virus, have faced multiple lockdowns, and have also experienced other economic restraints, due to this very phenomenon. In order to compare the possible monetary policy options, and their outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper refers to the global recession shock, as a valid point of reference. In addition to this, in order to gain access to the empirical evidence, the ARDL methodology has been applied on the quarterly data from 2005Q3 to 2020Q3. The results of the study have indicated that various plans have been taken into consideration, so as to lessen the consequences of these shocks that have trickled down into the respective economies of these countries. That is to put forth that, in the incidence of global recession, the monetary authorities have resorted to a less prudent stance. Whereas, more flexibility, through a persistent decrease in the policy rate has been observed since the pandemic first hit the world. In this regard, our results imply that a successful, efficient and effective response to the economic consequences of COVID-19, would ideally entail a set of remedial policies and structural reforms. © 2021 The Author(s).

We set out to test whether decision aids can support self-isolation. DESIGN: We conducted a pre-registered online experiment with a nationally representative sample (n = 500). Three stages tested: (i) whether decision trees help people to decide whether they need to self-isolate; (ii) whether an online planning tool increases people's confidence in their ability to self-isolate; and (iii) whether infographics help people to absorb advice on managing a household in which someone must self-isolate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (i) Accuracy of matching symptom patterns to a response scale for the need to self-isolate; (ii) self-reported confidence in coping with self-isolation; (iii) objective tests of recall and comprehension. RESULTS: Decision trees improved decisions about when self-isolation was necessary, although participants systematically underestimated the need to self-isolate with less common COVID-19 symptoms (e.g. sore throat, fatigue). The online planning tool increased confidence about coping with self-isolation only among the adults aged under 40. Infographics improved recall and comprehension of how to manage self-isolation. CONCLUSION: Decision aids can be used to support self-isolation during COVID-19.

Modification of HBOT session timing and chamber decontamination procedures, utilisation of telehealth services for initial patient evaluations, and acceptance of novel patient populations and diagnoses are mechanisms by which HBOT centers can adapt to the evolving model of health care delivery throughout a pandemic. While COVID-19 is not a currently accepted indication for HBOT, patients may be referred for HBOT consultation due to the post-infectious sequelae of the virus, and thus HBOT facilities must be aware of the potential uses of this treatment for post-viral complications.

METHOD: PubMed and EMBASE were searched on January 20th, 2021 to investigate characteristics of lung sequelae in COVID-19 patients. Chest computed tomography (CT) and pulmonary function test (PFT) data were collected and analyzed using one-group meta-analysis. RESULTS: Our search identified 15 eligible studies with follow-up period in a range of 1-6 months. A total of 3066 discharged patients were included in these studies. Among them, 1232 and 1359 patients were evaluated by chest CT and PFT, respectively. The approximate follow-up timing on average was 90 days after either symptom onset or hospital discharge. The frequency of residual CT abnormalities after hospital discharge was 55.7% (95% confidential interval (CI) 41.2-70.1, I2 = 96.2%). The most frequent chest CT abnormality was ground glass opacity in 44.1% (95% CI 30.5-57.8, I2 = 96.2%), followed by parenchymal band or fibrous stripe in 33.9% (95% CI 18.4-49.4, I2 = 95.0%). The frequency of abnormal pulmonary function test was 44.3% (95% CI 32.2-56.4, I2 = 82.1%), and impaired diffusion capacity was the most frequently observed finding in 34.8% (95% CI 25.8-43.8, I2 = 91.5%).

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of masks and other preventive behaviours in adults aged &#8805;18 years was conducted in five cities: Sydney and Melbourne, Australia; London, UK; and Phoenix and New York, USA. Data were analysed according to the epidemiology of COVID-19, mask mandates and a range of predictors of mask wearing. RESULTS: The most common measures used were avoiding public areas (80.4%), hand hygiene (76.4%), wearing masks (71.8%) and distancing (67.6%). Over 40% of people avoided medical facilities. These measures decreased from March-July 2020. Pandemic fatigue was associated with younger age, low perceived severity of COVID-19 and declining COVID-19 prevalence. Predictors of mask wearing were location (US, UK), mandates, age <50 years, education, having symptoms and knowing someone with COVID-19. Negative experiences with mask wearing and low perceived severity of COVID-19 reduced mask wearing. Most respondents (98%) believed that hand washing and distancing were necessary, and 80% reported no change or stricter adherence to these measures when wearing masks. CONCLUSION: Pandemic mitigation measures were widely reported across all cities, but decreased between March and July 2020. Pandemic fatigue was more common in younger people. Cities with mandates had higher rates of mask wearing. Promotion of mask use for older people may be useful. Masks did not result in a reduction of other hygiene measures.","MacIntyre, Chandini Raina; Nguyen, Phi-Yen; Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Trent, Mallory; Gerber, Brian; Steinhofel, Kathleen; Seale, Holly",Int J Infect Dis,157,16

Finally, it was expected that risk aversion positively influenced distress directly and through the increasing of worry, health-related information seeking behavior, and more positive perception of the utility of the lockdown The study was conducted in Italy during the mandatory lockdown for COVID-19 pandemic on 240 individuals (age range 18-76). Data recruitment was conducted via snowball sampling. COVID-19 exposure was positively associated with worry and health-related information seeking. Risk-aversion was positively associated with health-related information seeking and perceived utility of the lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. Worry and health-related information seeking were positively associated with distress, whereas the perceived utility of the lockdown was negatively associated with distress. Intolerance for the ambiguity was directly linked to distress with a positive sign. Findings suggest that risk aversion represents both a risk factor and a protective factor, based on what kind of variable mediates the relationship with distress, and that the intolerance to the ambiguity is a risk factor that busters distress.","Petrocchi, S; Iannello, P; Ongaro, G; Antonietti, A; Pravettoni, G",Curr Psychol,157,30

METHOD: Participants (Nâ=â474 employed U.S. individuals) completed an online survey from April 6 to 12, 2020. Linear regressions were used to examine factors associated with mental health. RESULTS: After accounting for demographic characteristics, health status, other COVID-19 experiences, and anxiety symptoms, greater job insecurity due to COVID-19 was related to greater depressive symptoms. Conversely, after accounting for covariates and depressive symptoms, greater financial concern was related to greater anxiety symptoms. Further, greater job insecurity was indirectly related to greater anxiety symptoms due to greater financial concern. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that employers should aim to reduce job insecurity and financial concern among employees during the COVID-19 pandemic to address the associated mental health consequences.","Wilson, Jenna M; Lee, Jerin; Fitzgerald, Holly N; Oosterhoff, Benjamin; Sevi, Baris; Shook, Natalie J",J Occup Environ Med,157,30

METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 6-month outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients with new neurological complications during hospitalization who survived were propensity score-matched to COVID-19 survivors without neurological complications hospitalized during the same period. The primary 6-month outcome was multivariable ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin Scale(mRS) comparing patients with or without neurological complications. Secondary outcomes included: activities of daily living (ADLs;Barthel Index), telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Neuro-QoL batteries for anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep. RESULTS: Of 606 COVID-19 patients with neurological complications, 395 survived hospitalization and were matched to 395 controls; N = 196 neurological patients and N = 186 controls completed follow-up. Overall, 346/382 (91%) patients had at least one abnormal outcome: 56% had limited ADLs, 50% impaired cognition, 47% could not return to work and 62% scored worse than average on &#8805;1 Neuro-QoL scale (worse anxiety 46%, sleep 38%, fatigue 36%, and depression 25%). In multivariable analysis, patients with neurological complications had worse 6-month mRS (median 4 vs. 3 among controls, adjusted OR 1.98, 95%CI 1.23-3.48, P = 0.02), worse ADLs (aOR 0.38, 95%CI 0.29-0.74, P = 0.01) and were less likely to return to work than controls (41% versus 64%, P = 0.04).

We recently encountered this in the management of 2 patients with effort-induced upper extremity venous thrombosis following COVID-19 infection and offer a treatment paradigm for consideration. CASE REPORTS: A 30-year-old presented with 2 weeks of left upper extremity symptoms following COVID-19 infection. Duplex ultrasound demonstrated axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis and venogram confirmed total occlusion of the axillary and subclavian veins with profuse collaterals around the occlusion. Suction thrombectomy was performed successfully and veins remained patent at 6 month follow up. The patient declined first rib resection and stopped lifting weights. A 16-year-old presented with 4 days of right arm symptoms 1 month after testing positive for COVID-19. Duplex ultrasound revealed acute axillary and subclavian vein thrombosis and she underwent successful thrombectomy followed by balloon angioplasty with improvement in symptoms. CONCLUSION: The pandemic has strained health care resources such that the treatment of non-life-threatening conditions must be triaged to conserve resources. While axillary-subclavian venous occlusion is usually not life-threatening, timely treatment leads to decreased morbidity and better outcomes. Percutaneous aspiration and thrombectomy without adjunctive thrombolysis may be of benefit in reducing healthcare resource utilization while still achieving good outcomes during the COVID pandemic and beyond.","Mukherjee, Dipankar; Kittner, Janine",Vasc Endovascular Surg,157,26

We sought to identify risk factors for influenza-related hospitalization, specifically the role of immunization and oseltamivir prescriptions. METHODS: Patients with influenza diagnoses were identified from the MarketScan database (2014-2018). Primary risk factors of interest were an influenza vaccination within 6 months prior to infection and oseltamivir prescriptions (filled on the day diagnosis, the following day, or 2-5 days). A multivariable logistic regression model was run to identify risk factors for influenza-related hospitalizations within 30 days of diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 2 395 498 influenza infections, 0.27% were hospitalized. Of those prescribed oseltamivir the day of diagnosis, 0.13% were later hospitalized, compared to 0.67% among those who filled prescriptions the following day and 11.8% when filled within 2 to 5 days. Upon adjustment, oseltamivir prescriptions filled on the day of diagnosis were associated with significantly decreased odds of hospitalization (OR 0.51 CI 0.48-0.55). Prescriptions filled within 1 to 5 days of diagnosis were associated with significantly increased odds of hospitalization (1 day OR 2.01 CI 1.81-2.24; 2-5 days OR 34.1 CI 31.7-36.6). Flu vaccination was associated with a lower odds for hospitalization (OR 0.84 CI 0.74-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: We recommend oseltamivir be prescribed to patients when they first present with influenza-like symptoms to reduce the burden on the healthcare system. We also identified reduced odds of hospitalization associated with influenza vaccination, which is already well established, but particularly important this coming flu season.","Athanassoglou, Vassilis; Wilson, Lauren A; Liu, Jiabin; Poeran, Jashvant; Zhong, Haoyan; Memtsoudis, Stavros G",J Prim Care Community Health,157,23

The rest of the animals were challenged with heat and assigned to the following groups: (II) Heat stress control (HSC) received only basal diet; (III) Standard treatment (ST) received basal diet + vit E (100 ppm); (IV-VI) Herbal treatments (HT) received basal diet + 250, 350, and 450 ppm CEO. Heat stress could significantly decrease the animals' performance and induce severe oxidative/nitrosative stress. The HT at the middle dose could significantly improve body weight, body weight gain, and feed intake compared to HSC; however, none of the treatments had a significant effect on feed conversion ratio after inducing heat stress. Moreover, both ST and HT with a trend towards concentration-dependent fashion significantly contributed to normalization of oxidative/nitrosative biomarkers.

Here, we present the management of a suspected COVID-19 patient. Case: A 66-year-old man with a recent travel history, infective symptoms, and chest X-ray was presented to our hospital. Considering his septic condition, we decided to perform an emergency surgery. The patient was given supplemental oxygen through a face mask and transported to an operating theatre on a plastic-covered trolley. An experienced anesthetist performed rapid sequence intubation using a video laryngoscope. Due to the initial presentation of respiratory distress, the patient remained intubated after surgery to avoid re-intubation. Precautions against droplet, contact, and airborne infection were instituted. Conclusions: Our objective was to facilitate surgical management of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 while minimizing the risk of nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers and other patients.","Yek, Jia Lin Jacklyn; Kiew, Sheng Chuu Anne; Ngu, James Chi-Yong; Lim, Jimmy Guan Cheng",Korean J Anesthesiol,157,15

The utility of such tasks arises from the complex interaction of linguistic demands (word retrieval, sentence formulation, articulation). However, this complexity also makes spontaneous speech hugely variable and difficult to assess. The current study aimed to simplify the problem by identifying latent factors underlying performance in spontaneous speech in aphasia. The ecological validity of the factors was examined by examining how well the factor structures corresponded to traditionally defined aphasia subtypes. Method A factor analysis was conducted on 17 microlinguistic measures of narratives from 274 individuals with aphasia in AphasiaBank. The resulting factor scores were compared across aphasia subtypes. Supervised (linear discriminant analysis) and unsupervised (latent profile analysis) classification techniques were then conducted on the factor scores and the solutions compared to traditional aphasia subtypes. Results Six factors were identified. Two reflected aspects of fluency, one at the phrase level (Phrase Building) and one at the narrative level (Narrative Productivity). Two other factors reflected the accuracy of productions, one at the word level (Semantic Anomaly) and one at the utterance level (Grammatical Error). The other two factors reflected the complexity of sentence structures (Grammatical Complexity) and the use of repair behaviors (Repair), respectively. Linear discriminant analyses showed that only about two thirds of speakers were classified correctly and that misclassifications were similar to disagreements between clinical diagnoses. The most accurately diagnosed syndromes were the largest groups-Broca's and anomic aphasia. The latent profile analysis also generated profiles similar to Broca's and anomic aphasia but separated some subtypes according to severity. Conclusions The factor solution and the classification analyses reflected broad patterns of spontaneous speech performance in a large and representative sample of individuals with aphasia. However, such data-driven approaches present a simplified picture of aphasia patterns, much as traditional syndrome categories do. To ensure ecological validity, a hybrid approach is recommended, balancing population-level analyses with examination of performance at the level of theoretically specified subgroups or individuals.

Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, compliance with isolation rules, re-admission rates, and outcomes were investigated. A total of 41 patients with COVID-19 were followed on home isolation without hospitalization. The median age of the patients was 36 years. Twenty-four (58.5%) of 41 patients were female. Twenty-nine (70.7%) patients were healthcare workers. The most common symptoms at admission were cough, myalgia/arthralgia, and loss of smell and/or taste. Fourteen (34.1%) patients were asymptomatic on the first admission. Anti-viral treatment was given to 27 (65.8%) of 41 patients. Four of 41 patients were readmitted to the outpatient clinic and hospitalized. Three patients had worsening respiratory symptoms and pneumonia was detected in CT scans. One patient was hospitalized because of disseminated herpes zoster infection. Two patients who jeopardized the isolation rules were isolated and monitored at another hospital by provincial health directorate teams.

The aim of this report is to describe the results of treating COVID-19 positive patients with nitazoxanide in three clinical settings: pregnancy/puerperium, hospitalized patients in an Internal Medicine Service and in an ambulatory setting. METHODOLOGY: This was a prospective follow-up and report of COVID-19 cases in three different situations, pregnant women, hospitalized patients receiving medical attention in an Internal Medicine Service and ambulatory patients residing in Toluca City, and Mexico City. RESULTS: The experience with a first group of 20 women, pregnant (17) or in immediate puerperium (3) was successful in 18 cases with two unfortunate deaths. The five cases treated in an Internal Medicine service showed a positive outcome with two patients weaned from mechanical ventilation. Of the remaining 16 patients treated in an ambulatory setting, all got cured. Nitazoxanide seems to be useful against SARS-CoV-2, not only in an early intervention but also in critical condition as well as in pregnancy without undesired effects for the babies. As an adjunctive therapy budesonide was used that seems to contribute to the clinical improvement.

Commonly, classes that had been delivered face to face were moved to a virtual delivery format;a practice that continued during the fall 2020 semester. The purpose of this investigation was to perform an interim analysis of COVID-related changes on student performance. We hypothesized that despite adequate preparation time for conversion to online delivery and a student body comprised largely of digital natives, the collective challenges associated with COVID-19 would negatively impact student performance. To address this hypothesis we compared midterm data from fall 2020 to a comparison population comprised of midterm data pooled from the 2015-2019 fall semesters from a large, public, Midwest university. Midterms are assigned as letter grades to students receiving a C- or below in a class. Letter grades were tallied for each term and then converted to a numerical score using a five-point scale (C- = 1, F = 5) and summed across all midterm grades within a term to allow quantitation and statistical comparison. We discovered that the percent of students with a midterm (&lt;C in a class) was ~15% lower in 2020 compared to the comparison group (p&lt;0.0001) and that this rate has been declining since 2015 (p&lt;0.0001). However, of the students that received midterms, there was a slight but significant increase in the number of midterms/student (p&lt;0.01) as well as in the variation of the midterms/student (p&lt;0.001) in 2020 compared to the comparison group. Moreover, students had lower grades reported (0.39 summed points;p&lt;0.0001) and a greater amount of variance among those reported grades in the 2020 midterm group compared to the comparison group (p&lt;0.0001). Finally, within the 2020 dataset, STEM majors had 10% more midterms/student (p&lt;0.05) and these midterms were more severe (0.52 summed points;p&lt;0.05) compared to non-STEM majors. These data indicate that, surprisingly, and despite COVID-19 related challenges, the percent of total students with midterms was decreased compared to previous semesters. Importantly though, despite significant efforts of faculty and universities, there is a population of students with exaggerated performance deficits compared to previous semesters. Given our finding of a smaller population of students with midterms, the exaggerated performance deficits in students with midterms may be due to factors external to instructional quality and point to social-, economic-, health-, and internet access-related barriers, which themselves maybe independent or interdependent, as well as the suitability and/or preparedness of the student for online instruction. Identification and remediation of these factors is essential given the likelihood of continued and expanded virtual learning, particularly for STEM students.","Selsby, Joshua Bundy Jennifer",The FASEB Journal,157,29

Permanent or intensive exposure to MoD can have serious consequences. Appropriate support services have the potential to improve the handling of MoD. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to provide an overview of the current state of research on MoD among medical students and young medical professionals in order to sensitize lecturers with responsibility for education and training and doctors in leading positions to the problem. MAIN PART: This article presents the scientific concept of MoD, known triggers, and options for prevention and intervention. The topic is presented with reference to the changes in patient care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and research needs are presented. CONCLUSION: The article illustrates the necessity of a German-language, interdisciplinary discourse on MoD among medical students and young professionals.","Kühlmeyer, Katja; Kuhn, Eva; Knochel, Kathrin; Hildesheim, Hanna; Witt, Victoria Dorothea; Friedrich, Orsolya; Rogge, Annette",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,157,24

To this end, we used a retrospective pretest-posttest design together with a latent change score model to analyze our data. From April to May of 2020, 394 Portuguese parents of students in grades 1-9 participated in this study. Our results showed that students' anxiety and teachers' social support, as perceived by parents, were highly significant predictors of academic motivation changes. Specifically, we found a negative effect of anxiety and a positive effect of teachers' social support on students' academic motivation. Our results did not show, however, a significant predictive role of classmates' social support. This study provides an important contribution to further understand the intrapersonal and interpersonal factors that are associated with the decline of students' academic motivation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pivotal role of teachers in sustaining students' academic motivation and other relevant educational implications for the ongoing pandemic are discussed.","Camacho, A.; Correia, N.; Zaccoletti, S.; Daniel, J.

The pandemic poses a variety of health risks including stressful disruptions in social and economic activity. Understanding the pandemic's effects on already vulnerable populations, such as individuals with chronic pain, may inform healthcare preparation for future catastrophic events. Given the association between excessive discounting of delayed rewards and chronic pain, this study examined relationships between delay discounting, pain severity, and COVID-19 perceived stress in individuals with chronic pain. Individuals reporting chronic pain (N = 180; 41% female; 86% white; 59% with a college degree) were recruited via the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform in this cross-sectional study. Measures of pain severity, delay discounting, probability discounting, and COVID-19 perceived stress were collected. Delay discounting was a significant predictor of overall pain severity (p < .02) and COVID-19 perceived stress (p < .001). Also, the magnitude of COVID-19 perceived stress fully mediated the relationship between delay discounting and overall pain severity (p = .004). Probability discounting was not a significant predictor of pain severity or COVID-19 perceived stress (p > .05). These findings highlight the importance of excessive discounting of delayed rewards as a potential determinant of pain severity as well as predictor of perceived stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the discounting of delayed rewards is of particular therapeutic importance for individuals with chronic pain in the context of stressful events.

In the face of this medical challenge threatening humans, the development of rapid and accurate methods for early screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 became crucial to containing the emerging public health threat, and prevent further spread within the population. Despite the large number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in China, some problematic cases with inconsistent laboratory testing results, were reported. Specifically, a high false-negative rate of 41% on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays was observed in China. Although serological testing has been applied worldwide as a complementary method to help identify SARS-CoV-2, several limitations on its use have been reported in China. Therefore, the use of both qRT-PCR and serological testing in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in China and elsewhere, presented considerable challenges, but when used in combination, can be valuable tools in the fight against COVID-19. In this review, we give an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of different molecular techniques for SARS-CoV-2 detection that are currently used in several labs, including qRT-PCR, gene sequencing, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), nucleic acid mass spectrometry (MS), and gene editing technique based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas13) system. Then we mainly review and analyze some causes of false-negative qRT-PCR results, and how to resolve some of the diagnostic dilemma.","Jing, Ran; Kudinha, Timothy; Zhou, Meng-Lan; Xiao, Meng; Wang, He; Yang, Wen-Hang; Xu, Ying-Chun; Hsueh, Po-Ren",J. microbiol. immunol. infect,157,20

METHODS: An international cross-sectional survey was administered to 2557 caregivers of children in 17 pediatric emergency departments (EDs) across 6 countries from March 26, 2020, to June 30, 2020. Caregivers were asked to select 1 of 4 choices with which they most agreed regarding a proposed COVID-19 vaccine-approval process, in addition to questions regarding demographic characteristics, the ED visit, and attitudes about COVID-19. Univariate analyses were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test for comparing non-normally distributed continuous variables, an independent t test for comparing normally distributed continuous variables, and a &#967;2 or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used for determining independent factors associated with caregivers' willingness to accept abridged development of a COVID-19 vaccine. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. FINDINGS: Almost half (1101/2557; 43%) of caregivers reported that they were willing to accept less rigorous testing and postresearch approval of a new COVID-19 vaccine. Independent factors associated with caregivers' willingness to accept expedited COVID-19 vaccine research included having children who were up to date on the vaccination schedule (odds ratio [OR] = 1.72; 95% CI, 1.29-2.31), caregivers' concern about having had COVID-19 themselves at the time of survey completion in the ED (OR = 1.1; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16), and caregivers' intent to have their children vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine were to become available (OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.54-2.21). Compared with fathers, mothers completing the survey were less likely to approve of changes in the vaccine-development process (OR = 0.641; 95% CI, 0.529-0.775). IMPLICATIONS: Less than half of caregivers in this worldwide sample were willing to accept abbreviated COVID-19 vaccine testing. As a part of an effort to increase acceptance and uptake of a new vaccine, especially in order to protect children, public health strategies and individual providers should understand caregivers' attitudes toward the approval of a vaccine and consult them appropriately.","Goldman, Ran D; Marneni, Shashidhar R; Seiler, Michelle; Brown, Julie C; Klein, Eileen J; Cotanda, Cristina Parra; Gelernter, Renana; Yan, Tyler D; Hoeffe, Julia; Davis, Adrienne L; Griffiths, Mark A; Hall, Jeanine E; Gualco, Gianluca; Mater, Ahmed; Manzano, Sergio; Thompson, Graham C; Ahmed, Sara; Ali, Samina; Shimizu, Naoki",Clin Ther,157,21

Barriers for implementation fidelity and feasibility of PE policies included inconsistencies in the time allocated to PE across schools and regions in the country; inconsistencies between teachers' planning of PE classes and the actual class; a wide diversity of professional profiles among PE teachers; a limited number of PE professors, materials and facilities. To address these situations, some PE teachers were able to modify lesson plans and to design PE materials made from recycled materials. In conclusion, the current way in which school-based PE policies are being implemented in Mexico hinder PE from playing a major role in promoting physical activity among children and adolescents.","G-Olvera, Armando; Pacheco-Miranda, Selene; Orozco Núñez, Emanuel; Aguilar-Farias, Nicolás; López Fernández, Iván; Jáuregui, Alejandra",Health promot. internation,157,1

In recent years in China, promoting the citizenization (""shimin hua"") of migrants and improving the quality of urbanization have become the focus of attention in the new-type urbanization today. The housing space consumption of migrants is one of the important indices to look into regarding their real living status in the receiving cities: how do the housing consumption behavior and residential quality vary between the local, inter- and intra-provincial migratory patterns? This article uses the micro household data of the 1% population sampling survey conducted in 2015 by the National Bureau of Statistics of China to look into the spatial variance of the aggregate housing space consumption behaviors of the local and non-local population at the prefectural level and above in urban China. This study finds that: (a) the longer migratory pattern indicates a thriftier housing space consumption that implies a higher probability of residential overcrowding among the inter-provincial migrants; at the same time, the locals enjoy the greater living comfort than their migrant peers; (b) the spatial variance in terms of housing space consumption can be attributed to a series of destination city contexts, such as the geological background, city administrative rank, areal location, local-nonlocal demography, municipal economic growth, and the local residential development levels. The results show that the more ""targeted"" housing policies are needed to solve the housing difficulties with migrant workers for a goal of human-centered urbanization development. Although we lack the more detailed data-sets to examine the correlation between public health risks (like the COVID-19 pandemic) and housing congestion problems (especially with the population on the move), this research is still illuminating in terms of how to cut down the public health risk in a highly mobile and rapidly urbanizing context like China.","Cao, Yuting; Liu, Ran; Qi, Wei; Wen, Jin",Sustainability,157,9

Being worn closely attached to the people's face, they are continuously subjected to routine movements, i.e., facial expressions, breathing, and talking. These motional forces represent an unusual source of wasted mechanical energy that can be rather harvested by electromechanical transducers and exploited to power mask-integrated sensors. Typically, piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators are exploited to this aim; however, most of the current devices are too thick or wide, not really conformable, and affected by humidity, which make them hardly embeddable in a mask, in contact with skin. Different from recent attempts to fabricate smart energy-harvesting cloth masks, in this work, a wearable energy harvester is rather enclosed in the mask and can be reused and not disposed. The device is a metal-free hybrid piezoelectric nanogenerator (hPENG) based on soft biocompatible materials. In particular, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes in the pure form and with a biobased plasticizer (cardanol oil, CA) are electrospun onto a laser-ablated polyimide flexible substrate attached on a skin-conformable elastomeric blend of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and Ecoflex. The multilayer structure of the device harnesses the piezoelectricity of the PVDF nanofibers and the friction triboelectric effects. The ultrasensitive mechanoelectrical transduction properties of the composite device are determined by the strong electrostatic behavior of the membranes and the plasticization effect of cardanol. In addition, encapsulation based on PVDF, PDMS, CA, and parylene C is used, allowing the hPENG to exhibit optimal reliability and resistance against the wet and warm atmosphere around the face mask. The proposed device reveals potential applications for the future development of smart masks with coupled energy-harvesting devices, allowing to use them not only for anti-infective protection but also to supply sensors or active antibacterial/viral devices.","Mariello, Massimo; Qualtieri, Antonio; Mele, Giuseppe; De Vittorio, Massimo",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,157,16

The comparison consisted of analyzing measured data and noise maps produced for the city center area. The maps were created according to measured and collected data of the respective time periods. The acoustic scenario prior to the pandemic time was reconstructed based on previous measurements and data collection, while the pandemic one was built with data survey during the highest social isolation index on July 2020. The comparative analysis showed a considerable noise reduction, between 10 and 15 dB, for areas where the traffic noise was not intense and where the human activities were predominant on the streets. However, there was no substantial noise decrease for the areas around the major avenues. This occurred due to the traffic intensity drop to 50% during the pandemic, which meant a noise reduction between 3 and 5 dB. © 2021 Nayara Gevú et al., published by De Gruyter.","Gevú, N.; Carvalho, B.; Fagerlande, G.

We obtained samples from each patient, and serial viral load was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We found that the viral load in the sputum was inclined to be higher than samples obtained from the nasopharyngeal swab at disease presentation. Moreover, the viral load in the sputum decreased more slowly over time than in the nasopharyngeal group as the disease progressed. Interestingly, even when samples in the nasopharyngeal swab turned negative, it was commonly observed that patients with underlying diseases, especially hypertension and diabetes, remained positive for COVID-19 and required a longer period for the sputum samples to turn negative. These combined findings emphasize the importance of tracking sputum samples even in patients with negative tests from nasopharyngeal swabs, especially for those with underlying conditions. In conclusion, this work reinforces the importance of sputum samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection to minimize transmission of COVID-19 within the community.","Liu, R; Yi, S; Zhang, J; Lv, Z; Zhu, C; Zhang, Y",J Dent Res,157,26

We hypothesized that the outcome of AED treatment can be predicted from EEG data in patients with TLE. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with TLE and twenty-five healthy controls were examined. Clinical outcome was dichotomized into seizure-free (SF) and non-seizure-free (NSF) after two years of LEV. EEG parameters were compared between healthy controls and patients with TLE at baseline (EEGpre) and after three months of AED therapy (EEGpre-post) and between SF and NSF patients. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves models were built to test whether EEG parameters predicted outcome. RESULTS: AED therapy induces an increase in EEG power for Alpha (p = 0.06) and a decrease in Theta (p < 0.05). Connectivity values were lower in SF compared to NSF patients (p < 0.001). Quantitative EEG predicted outcome after LEV treatment with an estimated accuracy varying from 65.2% to 91.3% (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.56-0.93) for EEGpre and from 69.9% to 86.9% (AUC = 0.69-0.94) for EEGpre-post. CONCLUSIONS: AED therapy induces EEG modifications in TLE patients, and such modifications are predictive of clinical outcome. SIGNIFICANCE: Quantitative EEG may help understanding the effect of AEDs in the central nervous system and offer new prognostic biomarkers for patients with epilepsy.","Ricci, Lorenzo; Assenza, Giovanni; Pulitano, Patrizia; Simonelli, Valerio; Vollero, Luca; Lanzone, Jacopo; Mecarelli, Oriano; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo; Tombini, Mario",Clin Neurophysiol,157,5

Understanding the incidence of secondary pulmonary infections and the associated bacterial and fungal microorganisms identified can improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review aims to determine the incidence of secondary bacterial and fungal pulmonary infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and describe the bacterial and fungal microorganisms identified. METHOD: We perform a literature search and select articles with confirmed diagnoses of secondary bacterial and fungal pulmonary infections that occur 48 h after admission, using respiratory tract cultures in hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients. We exclude articles involving co-infections defined as infections diagnosed at the time of admission by non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses, bacteria, and fungal microorganisms. RESULTS: The incidence of secondary pulmonary infections is low at 16% (4.8-42.8%) for bacterial infections and lower for fungal infections at 6.3% (0.9-33.3%) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Secondary pulmonary infections are predominantly seen in critically ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The most common bacterial microorganisms identified in the respiratory tract cultures are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella species, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common microorganism identified to cause secondary fungal pulmonary infections. Other rare opportunistic infection reported such as PJP is mostly confined to small case series and case reports. The overall time to diagnose secondary bacterial and fungal pulmonary infections is 10 days (2-21 days) from initial hospitalization and 9 days (4-18 days) after ICU admission. The use of antibiotics is high at 60-100% involving the studies included in our review. CONCLUSION: The widespread use of empirical antibiotics during the current pandemic may contribute to the development of multidrug-resistant microorganisms, and antimicrobial stewardship programs are required for minimizing and de-escalating antibiotics. Due to the variation in definition across most studies, a large, well-designed study is required to determine the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of secondary pulmonary infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Chong, Woon H; Saha, Biplab K; Chopra, Amit",Infection,157,16

However, numerous local species are traded and given less consideration despite their importance. Hence, we observed the local markets in the Feuang and Mad districts of Vientiane Province in summer and winter seasons to determine the species for trade, as well as their volume and conservation status. Altogether, 602 specimens corresponding to 23 genera and 22 species were identified. Among them, the highest number of species were mammals, followed by birds, reptiles, amphibians, and insects. Six species are listed in threatened categories according to the IUCN and nine under CITES categories. The species in trade varied between seasons, as winter was the main poaching season for mammals and birds, and summer was for amphibians, reptiles, and insects. This study revealed that food, traditional medicine, and curio production were the main reasons for wildlife trade. The lack of strong regulations, monitoring and law enforcement, and poverty are the major reasons for wildlife trade. Therefore, strong law enforcement, creating alternate income sources, and participatory conservation programs are required to effectively control wildlife trade in the Lao PDR.","Banjade, Maniram; Adhikari, Pradeep; Oh, Hong-Shik",,157,24

Here we present evidence that backtracking extends into the viral realm, where backtracking by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) may aid viral transcription and replication. Structures of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp bound to the essential nsp13 helicase and RNA suggested the helicase facilitates backtracking. We use cryo-electron microscopy, RNA-protein cross-linking, and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp backtracking. The results establish that the single-stranded 3' segment of the product RNA generated by backtracking extrudes through the RdRp nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) entry tunnel, that a mismatched nucleotide at the product RNA 3' end frays and enters the NTP entry tunnel to initiate backtracking, and that nsp13 stimulates RdRp backtracking.

However, the relationship between abdominal obesity and CXR severity score has not yet been fully explored. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the association of different adiposity indexes, including waist circumference and body mass index (BMI), with CXR severity score in 215 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Patients with abdominal obesity showed significantly higher CXR severity scores and had higher rates of CXR severity scores &#8805; 8 compared to those without abdominal obesity (P < 0.001; P = 0.001, respectively). By contrast, patients with normal weight, with overweight and those with BMI-based obesity showed no significant differences in either CXR severity scores or in the rates of CXR severity scores &#8805; 8 (P = 0.104; P = 0.271, respectively). Waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) correlated more closely with CXR severity scores than BMI (r = 0.43, P < 0.001; r = 0.41, P < 0.001; r = 0.17, P = 0.012, respectively). The area under the curves (AUCs) for waist circumference and WHtR were significantly higher than that for BMI in identifying a high CXR severity score (&#8805; 8) (0.68 [0.60-0.75] and 0.67 [0.60-0.74] vs 0.58 [0.51-0.66], P = 0.001). A multivariate analysis indicated abdominal obesity (risk ratio: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.25-2.45, P < 0.001), bronchial asthma (risk ratio: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.07-2.81, P = 0.026) and oxygen saturation at admission (risk ratio: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.97, P < 0.001) as the only independent factors associated with high CXR severity scores. CONCLUSION: Abdominal obesity phenotype is associated with a high CXR severity score better than BMI-based obesity in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Therefore, when visiting the patient in a hospital setting, waist circumference should be measured, and patients with abdominal obesity should be monitored closely.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of hospitalised patients diagnosed with COVID-19. SETTING: Data from all hospitals across Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: 522 167 hospitalised patients in Brazil by 14 December 2020 with severe acute respiratory illness, and a confirmed diagnosis for COVID-19. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of symptoms and comorbidities was compared by clinical outcomes and intensive care unit (ICU) admission status. Survival was assessed using Kaplan Meier survival estimates. Risk factors associated with in-hospital death were evaluated with multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Of the 522 167 patients included in this study, 56.7% were discharged, 0.002% died of other causes, 30.7% died of causes associated with COVID-19 and 10.2% remained hospitalised. The median age of patients was 61 years (IQR, 47-73), and of non-survivors 71 years (IQR, 60-80); 292 570 patients (56.0%) were men. At least one comorbidity was present in 64.5% of patients and in 76.8% of non-survivors. From illness onset, the median times to hospital and ICU admission were 6 days (IQR, 3-9) and 7 days (IQR, 3-10), respectively; 15 days (IQR, 9-24) to death and 15 days (IQR, 11-20) to hospital discharge.

Machine learning (ML) methods are being used in RWE and are promising tools for precision-medicine. In this study, ML methods are applied to study the efficacy of therapies on COVID-19 hospital admissions in the Valencian Region in Spain. Methods: 5244 and 1312 COVID-19 hospital admissions - dated between January 2020 and January 2021 from 10 health departments, were used respectively for training and validation of separate treatment-effect models (TE-ML) for remdesivir, corticosteroids, tocilizumab, lopinavir-ritonavir, azithromycin and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. 2390 admissions from 2 additional health departments were reserved as an independent test to analyze retrospectively the survival benefits of therapies in the population selected by the TE-ML models using cox-proportional hazard models. TE-ML models were adjusted using treatment propensity scores to control for pre-treatment confounding variables associated to outcome and further evaluated for futility. ML architecture was based on boosted decision-trees. Results: In the populations identified by the TE-ML models, only Remdesivir and Tocilizumab were significantly associated with an increase in survival time, with hazard ratios of 0.41 (P = 0.04) and 0.21 (P = 0.001), respectively. No survival benefits from chloroquine derivatives, lopinavir-ritonavir and azithromycin were demonstrated. Tools to explain the predictions of TE-ML models are explored at patient-level as potential tools for personalized decision making and precision medicine. Conclusion: ML methods are suitable tools toward RWE analysis of COVID-19 pharmacotherapies. Results obtained reproduce published results on RWE and validate the results from RCTs.","Bustos, Aurelia; MasSerrano, Patricio; Boquera, Mari L.; MedBravo, Jose M.

In this paper, we address both these issues by investigating whether gamification elements, integrated into a fitness course booking system, have an effect on how frequently users participate in fitness courses in a gym (N=52) over a duration of 275 days (548 days including baseline). Also, the gamification elements that we implemented are tailored to specific Hexad user types, which allows us to investigate whether using suitable gamification elements leads to an increased course participation.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Are clinical phenotypes of COVID-19 associated with differential response to corticosteroid therapy? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 from Tongji Hospital treated between January and February 2020 were included, and the main exposure of interest was the administration of IV corticosteroids. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Marginal structural modeling was used to account for baseline and time-dependent confounders. An unsupervised machine learning approach was carried out to identify phenotypes of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 428 patients were included; 280 of 428 patients (65.4%) received corticosteroid therapy. The 28-day mortality was significantly higher in patients who received corticosteroid therapy than in those who did not (53.9% vs 19.6%; P < .0001). After marginal structural modeling, corticosteroid therapy was not associated significantly with 28-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.54-1.18; P = .26). Our analysis identified two phenotypes of COVID-19, and compared with the hypoinflammatory phenotype, the hyperinflammatory phenotype was characterized by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, and higher rates of complications. Corticosteroid therapy was associated with a reduced 28-day mortality (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.25-0.80; P = .0062) in patients with the hyperinflammatory phenotype. INTERPRETATION: For critically ill patients with COVID-19, corticosteroid therapy was not associated with 28-day mortality, but the use of corticosteroids showed significant survival benefits in patients with the hyperinflammatory phenotype.","Chen, Hui; Xie, Jianfeng; Su, Nan; Wang, Jun; Sun, Qin; Li, Shusheng; Jin, Jun; Zhou, Jing; Mo, Min; Wei, Yao; Chao, Yali; Hu, Weiwei; Du, Bin; Qiu, Haibo",Chest,157,1

Here we propose a consistent picture of the wave pattern based on the epidemic Renormalisation Group (eRG) framework, which is guided by the global symmetries of the system under time rescaling. We show that the rate of spreading of the disease can be interpreted as a time-dilation symmetry, while the final stage of an epidemic episode corresponds to reaching a time scale-invariant state. We find that the endemic period between two waves is a sign of instability in the system, associated to near-breaking of the time scale-invariance. This phenomenon can be described in terms of an eRG model featuring complex fixed points. Our results demonstrate that the key to control the arrival of the next wave of a pandemic is in the strolling period in between waves, i.e. when the number of infections grows linearly. Thus, limiting the virus diffusion in this period is the most effective way to prevent or delay the arrival of the next wave. In this work we establish a new guiding principle for the formulation of mid-term governmental strategies to curb pandemics and avoid recurrent waves of infections, deleterious in terms of human life loss and economic damage.","Cacciapaglia, Giacomo; Cot, Corentin; Sannino, Francesco",Sci Rep,157,16

The rapidity and highly communicable nature of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has hampered the design and execution of definitive randomized, controlled trials of therapy outside of the clinic or hospital. In the absence of clinical trial results, physicians must use what has been learned about the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in determining early outpatient treatment of the illness with the aim of preventing hospitalization or death. This article outlines key pathophysiological principles that relate to the patient with early infection treated at home. Therapeutic approaches based on these principles include 1) reduction of reinoculation, 2) combination antiviral therapy, 3) immunomodulation, 4) antiplatelet/antithrombotic therapy, and 5) administration of oxygen, monitoring, and telemedicine.

The results achieved using HMDE were recorded with average relative standard deviation (RSD) 5.4% (from 3.2% to 8.6%) and using PLA-C 11.8% (from 6.5% to 18.0%). The results achieved using both electrodes proved to be equivalent with statistical probability higher than 95%.","Choinska, Marta; Hrdlicka, Vojtech; Sestáková, Ivana; Navrátil, Tomás",Monatsh Chem,157,29

Unlike other platforms such as Discord, Clubhouse is entirely audio-based, and is not organized by specific communities. Following Clubhouse's surge in popularity, there has been a rise in the development of other audio-based platforms, as well as the inclusion of audio-calling features to existing platforms. In this paper, we present a framework (MIC) for analyzing audio-based social platforms that accounts for unique platform affordances, the challenges they provide to both users and moderators, and how these affordances relate to one another using MIC diagrams. Next, we demonstrate how to apply the framework to preexisting audio-based platforms and Clubhouse, highlighting key similarities and differences in affordances across these platforms. Using MIC as a lens to examine observational data from Clubhouse members we uncover user perceptions and challenges in moderating audio on the platform.","Bajpai, Tanvi; Asher, Drshika; Goswami, Anwesa; Chandrasekharan, Eshwar",,157,1

In the same period, the number of recorded infections in Thailand has remained at approximately 3300. This paper explores the specifics of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 transmissions in Phuket, Thailand's second most visited tourist destination. Methods: High-risk contacts recorded by Phuket Provincial Public Health Office were analysed using the Probit model to investigate the risk factors for transmission from confirmed COVID-19 cases to their high-risk contacts. The analysis was further focused on the impact of quarantine measures in state provided facilities on contacts' probability of infection. Findings: 15.6% of 1108 high-risk contacts were found to be infected, and they accounted for 80% of 214 confirmed cases in Phuket till 29th April 2020. Moreover, 10.68% of all high-risk contacts were confirmed to be infected before the quarantine, and 4.55% after the policy was enforced. In addition, a contact who lived within the same household with a confirmed case was 25% more exposed to infection when compared to a contact who did not share a household. Interpretation: Results confirmed that the quarantine policy, which mandated individual isolation in the state provided facilities for all high-risk contacts, diminished contact's chance of infection from the confirmed cases, especially in the epicenter districts. Our findings confirmed that sharing accommodation with an infected case, and exposure to a case with several documented secondary transmission, generally increased the SARS-CoV-2 infection probability. Finally, some confirmed cases do exhibit a higher risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2 to their contacts compared to a typical confirmed case. Further studies of high reproduction groups of infected patients are recommended. Funding: No funding was received for this research.","Phucharoen, Chayanon; Sangkaew, Nichapat; Stosic, Kristina",EClinicalMedicine,157,21

Direct admission to ICU post-operatively for patients with a NELA ≥ 10% is recommended. In the current pandemic, the use of critical care beds must be rationalised. We investigated if patients with NELA ≥ 10% experienced worse outcomes if admitted to the ward post-operatively (instead of ICU). Method: We performed a retrospective audit of emergency laparotomies at Fiona Stanley Hospital over 6 months December 2019-May 2020. NELA scores were obtained from the ANZELA database and patient notes reviewed to identify post-operative unplanned ICU admissions and mortalities. Results: Twenty-four (30%) emergency laparotomy patients had a NELA ≥ 10%. Ten (42%) patients were admitted to the ward post-operatively. There were no unplanned ICU admissions in this group. Two (20%) patients had a documented 'code blue' but were managed conservatively on the ward. No patients in this group died within 30 days. Conclusions: Post-operative ward admission in selected patients with NELA ≥ 10% does not result in unplanned ICU admissions or increased mortality at a tertiary Acute Surgical Unit. This data is reassuring as we expect future ICU bed shortages for non-COVID surgical patients during the pandemic.","Shepherd, T.; Foster, A.",British Journal of Surgery,157,16

To enter host cells, the viral spike protein (S-protein) binds to its receptor, ACE2, and is then processed by TMPRSS2. Whilst receptor binding contributes to the viral host range, S-protein:ACE2 complexes from other animals have not been investigated widely. To predict infection risks, we modelled S-protein:ACE2 complexes from 215 vertebrate species, calculated changes in the energy of the complex caused by mutations in each species, relative to human ACE2, and correlated these changes with COVID-19 infection data. We also analysed structural interactions to better understand the key residues contributing to affinity. We predict that mutations are more detrimental in ACE2 than TMPRSS2. Finally, we demonstrate phylogenetically that human SARS-CoV-2 strains have been isolated in animals. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect a broad range of mammals, but few fish, birds or reptiles. Susceptible animals could serve as reservoirs of the virus, necessitating careful ongoing animal management and surveillance.","Lam, S D; Bordin, N; Waman, V P; Scholes, H M; Ashford, P; Sen, N; van Dorp, L; Rauer, C; Dawson, N L; Pang, C S M; Abbasian, M; Sillitoe, I; Edwards, S J L; Fraternali, F; Lees, J G; Santini, J M; Orengo, C A",Sci Rep,157,26

Methods: We conducted a survey that asked respondents to rate the seriousness of 80 health problems on a four-point Likert scale (“very serious problem,” “somewhat serious problem,” “not too serious of a problem,” or “not a problem at all”). Results were compared to past surveys from 2001 and 2013 that examined the same set of health problems (with the exception of COVID-19). The survey also included 15 MaxDiff questions that asked respondents to select the health problems they considered most and least important for research funding. Respondents were recruited from the KnowledgePanel, a nationally-representative sample of American households. Results: A total of 768 adults competed the survey between September 3 and 14, 2020. The health problems that Americans consider to be very serious generally align with the leading causes of death and noncommunicable diseases like heart disease (rated “very serious” by 55.3% of sample), diabetes (45.0%), and mental health (e.g., mental illness - 53.6%;depression - 50.7%);however, several social determinants of health (e.g., violence - 62.6%;racial discrimination - 52.9%) are also identified. COVID-19 was a perhaps unsurprising top priority (ranked 3rd at 62.4%), while cancer remains the highest (ranked first at 65.5%) and a persistent priority for research funding. Conclusions: Americans consider a diverse set of health problems to be very serious, with recognition of social determinants of health rising.

The reasons behind that difference are not fully understood, but underreporting is typically presumed as one of the main factors. This study aimed to assess FL epidemiology in Poland based on 2000-2014 data from the Polish National Cancer Registry, which has 100% population coverage and over 90% completeness of the registration. All cases were coded according to ICD-10 and ICD-O-3 recommendations. The total number of registered FL cases was 3,928 with crude (CR) and standardized (SR) incidence rates of 0.72/105 and 0.87/105, respectively. The median age of FL diagnosis was 61 years, with the male to female incidence ratio of 1.06. The distribution of morphological types of FL: not otherwise specified (NOS), grades 1, 2, or 3 were 72.58, 4.81, 12.88, and 9.73%, respectively.

Testing is one important method for monitoring and therefore controlling the spread of COVID-19. Yet with a serious discrepancy in the resources available between rich and poor countries not every country is able to employ widespread testing. Here we developed machine learning models for predicting the number of COVID-19 cases in a country based on multilinear regression and neural networks models. The models are trained on data from US states and tested against the reported infections in the European countries. The model is based on four features: Number of tests Population Percentage Urban Population and Gini index. The population and number of tests have the strongest correlation with the number of infections. The model was then tested on data from European countries for which the correlation coefficient between the actual and predicted cases R2 was found to be 0.88 in the multi linear regression and 0.91 for the neural network model. The model predicts that the actual number of infections in countries where the number of tests is less than 10% of their populations is at least 26 times greater than the reported numbers.,"Hashim, Samy; Farooq, Sally; Syriopoulos, Eleni; Cremer, Kai de la Lande; Vogt, Alexander; Jong, Nol de; Aguado, Victor L; Popescu, Mihai; Mohamed, Ashraf K; Amin, Muhamed",,157,13

Purpose: We aimed to explore early warning information for patients with severe/critical COVID-19 based on quantitative analysis of chest CT images at the lung segment level. Materials and Methods: A dataset of 81 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treated at Wuhan Wuchang hospital in Wuhan city from 21 January 2020 to 14 February 2020 was retrospectively analyzed, including ordinary and severe/critical cases. The time course of all subjects was divided into four stages. The differences in each lobe and lung segment between the two groups at each stage were quantitatively analyzed using the percentage of lung involvement (PLI) in order to investigate the most important segment of lung involvement in the severe/critical group and its corresponding time point. Results: Lung involvement in the ordinary and severe/critical groups reached a peak on the 18th and 14th day, respectively. In the first stage, PLIs in the right middle lobe and the left superior lobe between the two groups were significantly different. In the second stage and the fourth stage, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups in the whole lung, right superior lobe, right inferior lobe and left superior lobe. The rapid progress of the lateral segment of the right middle lobe on the second day and the anterior segment of the right upper lobe on the 13th day may be a warning sign for severe/critical patients. Age was the most important demographic characteristic of the severe/critical group. Conclusion: Quantitative assessment based on the lung segments of chest CT images provides early warning information for potentially severe/critical patients.","Yuyun, Xu; Lexi, Yu; Haochu, Wang; Zhenyu, Shu; Xiangyang, Gong",Front Public Health,157,1

OBJETIVE: The objective of this study is to describe the results obtained with the previous strategy of transferring activity to teleconsultation during the period of maximum impact of the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 16/03 and 10/05/2020 all successive consultations in our unit were performed in virtual rheumatology teleconference (RTC) format. The socio-demographic, geo-functional and clinical characteristics of all patients were collected; a numeric verbal scale (NVS) (where 0=very dissatisfied to 10=fully satisfied) was applied to assess the degree of satisfaction of the doctor/patient with the RTC. RESULTS: 469 TC were included. Most patients seen by RTC were women, mean age: 60,83 years. Only 16% had university education. The mean distance travelled for face-to face consultation is 33 Km with a mean total time of 2hours. Most individuals were diagnosed with osteoarthritis/soft tissue rheumatic diseases and/or osteoporosis; 21% had rheumatoid arthritis. The mean length of the TC was 9.64minutes. We find more patient satisfaction with the TC when their level of education is higher (OR=4.12); doctor satisfaction was higher when the individual was better able to manage the Internet (OR=3.01). CONCLUSION: It is possible to transfer rheumatological care activity to TC with a considerable degree of satisfaction for both the patient and the doctor.","Tornero-Molina, Jesús; Sánchez-Alonso, Fernando; Fernández-Prada, Manuel; Bris-Ochaita, María-Luisa; Sifuentes-Giraldo, Alberto; Vidal-Fuentes, Javier",Reumatol. clin.

Whilst several parameters influencing infection transmission are expected to be consistent across populations, the serial interval can vary across and within populations over time. Therefore, local estimates are preferable for use in epidemiological models developed at a regional level. We used data collected as part of the national contact tracing process in Ireland to estimate the serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Irish population, and to estimate the proportion of transmission events that occurred prior to the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: After data cleaning, the final dataset consisted of 471 infected close contacts from 471 primary cases. The median serial interval was 4 days, mean serial interval was 4.0 (95% confidence intervals 3.7, 4.3) days, whilst the 25th and 75th percentiles were 2 and 6 days respectively. We found that intervals were lower when the primary or secondary case were in the older age cohort (greater than 64 years). Simulating from an incubation period distribution from international literature, we estimated that 67% of transmission events had greater than 50% probability of occurring prior to the onset of symptoms in the infector. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst our analysis was based on a large sample size, data were collected for the primary purpose of interrupting transmission chains. Similar to other studies estimating the serial interval, our analysis is restricted to transmission pairs where the infector is known with some degree of certainty. Such pairs may represent more intense contacts with infected individuals than might occur in the overall population. It is therefore possible that our analysis is biased towards shorter serial intervals than the overall population.","McAloon, Conor G; Wall, Patrick; Griffin, John; Casey, Miriam; Barber, Ann; Codd, Mary; Gormley, Eamonn; Butler, Francis; McV Messam, Locksley L; Walsh, Cathal; Teljeur, Conor; Smyth, Breda; Nolan, Philip; Green, Martin J; O039,; Grady, Luke; Culhane, Kieran; Buckley, Claire; Carroll, Ciara; Doyle, Sarah; Martin, Jennifer; More, Simon J",BMC Public Health,157,16

Although self-quarantine and social-distancing measures were implemented, restrictions were less severe compared to several other countries. The aim of this study was to assess changes in eating behavior and food purchases among a representative adult sample in the Netherlands (n = 1030), five weeks into lockdown. The results show that most participants did not change their eating behaviors (83.0%) or food purchases (73.3%). However, socio-demographic differences were observed among those that reported changes during lockdown. For example, participants with overweight (OR = 2.26, 95%CI = 1.24-4.11) and obesity (OR = 4.21, 95%CI = 2.13-8.32) were more likely to indicate to eat unhealthier during lockdown compared to participants with a healthy weight. Those with a high educational level (OR = 2.25, 95%-CI = 1.03-4.93) were also more likely to indicate to eat unhealthier during lockdown compared to those with a low educational level. Older participants were more likely to indicate to experience no differences in their eating behaviors compared to those of younger age, who were more likely to indicate that they ate healthier (OR = 1.03, 95%CI = 1.01-1.04) as well as unhealthier (OR = 1.04, 95%CI = 1.02-1.06) during lockdown. Participants with obesity were more likely to indicate to purchase more chips/snacks (OR = 2.79, 95%CI = 1.43-5.45) and more nonalcoholic beverages (OR = 2.74, 95%CI = 1.36-5.50) during lockdown in comparison with those with a healthy weight. Of those that used meal delivery services before, 174 (29.5%) indicated to use meal delivery services more frequently during lockdown. Although the results confirm the persistence of dietary routines, profound socio-demographic differences were observed for those that did report changes. Especially for individuals with overweight and obesity, the lockdown has taken its toll on healthy dietary choices. Further research should unravel underlying mechanisms for these observations.","Poelman, Maartje P; Gillebaart, Marleen; Schlinkert, Caroline; Dijkstra, S Coosje; Derksen, Elianne; Mensink, Frederike; Hermans, Roel C J; Aardening, Pleun; de Ridder, Denise; de Vet, Emely",Appetite,157,24

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, interventional case series. METHODS: Twenty-one patients undergoing IXT surgery and their parents were included. Using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), children and parents were separately questioned about QOL of patients. RESULTS: The mean patients' age was 8.6 ± 3.2 years (SD), with range of 5-16 years. The children responded that all PedsQL scores were significantly improved by surgery, and the highest improvement was observed in the school subscale score. When the parents rated the children's QOL, significant improvements were limited to 3 out of 7 subscales, including the emotional, psychosocial health summary, and total scores. The improvements in the PedsQL score were not correlated with age, size of deviation changes following surgery, nor the improvement in binocular vision. CONCLUSIONS: The general health-related QOL significantly improved by surgery in pediatric patients with IXT, while the improvement was considerably underestimated by the parents. The children reported the greatest improvement in the school functioning subscale, whereas parents failed to discern this improvement. The discrepancy in children' and parents' views can be an important factor when considering indication of corrective surgery and evaluating surgical outcomes.","Morita, Yuka; Hiraoka, Takahiro; Oshika, Tetsuro",Jpn. j. ophthalmol,157,32

METHODS: The Canadian Rheumatology Association (CRA) formed a multidisciplinary panel including rheumatologists, researchers, methodologists, vaccine experts and patients. The panel used the GRADE approach. Outcomes were prioritized according to their importance for patients and clinicians. Evidence from the COVID-19 clinical trials was summarized. Indirect evidence for non-COVID-19 vaccines in ARD was also considered. The GRADE Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) framework was used to develop a recommendation for the use of the four COVID vaccines approved in Canada as of March 25, 2021 (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S) over four virtual panel meetings. RESULTS: The CRA guideline panel suggests using COVID-19 vaccination in persons with ARD. The panel unanimously agreed that for the majority of patients the potential health benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential harms in people with ARDs. The recommendation was graded as conditional because of low or very low certainty of the evidence about the effects in the population of interest primarily due to indirectness and imprecise effect estimates. The panel felt strongly that persons with autoimmune rheumatic diseases who meet local eligibility should not be required to take additional steps compared to people without autoimmune rheumatic diseases to obtain their vaccination. Guidance on medications, implementation, monitoring of vaccine uptake and research priorities are also provided.

No specific treatments for reducing mortality or morbidity are yet available. Deaths from COVID-19 will continue to rise globally until effective and appropriate treatments and/or vaccines are found. In search of effective treatments, the global medical, scientific, pharma and funding communities have rapidly initiated over 500 COVID-19 clinical trials on a range of antiviral drug regimens and repurposed drugs in various combinations. A paradigm shift is underway from the current focus of drug development targeting the pathogen, to advancing cellular Host-Directed Therapies (HDTs) for tackling the aberrant host immune and inflammatory responses which underlie the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and high COVID-19 mortality rates. We focus this editorial specifically on the background to, and the rationale for, the use and evaluation of mesenchymal stromal (Stem) cells (MSCs) in treatment trials of patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Currently, the ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) report a combined 28 trials exploring the potential of MSCs or their products for treatment of COVID-19. MSCs should also be trialed for treatment of other circulating WHO priority Blueprint pathogens such as MERS-CoV which causes upto 34% mortality rates. It's about time funding agencies invested more into development MSCs per se, and also for a range of other HDTs, in combination with other therapeutic interventions. MSC therapy could turn out to be an important contribution to bringing an end to the high COVID-19 death rates and preventing long-term functional disability in those who survive disease.","Zumla, Alimuddin; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Petrosillo, Nicola; Agrati, Chiara; Azhar, Esam I; Chang, Chao; El-Kafrawy, Sherif A; Osman, Mohamed; Zitvogel, Laurence; Galle, Peter R; Locatelli, Franco; Gorman, Ellen; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; O039,; Kane, Cecilia; McAuley, Danny; Maeurer, Markus",Int J Infect Dis,157,20

The link between collectivism and mask usage was robust to a host of control variables, including cultural tightness-looseness, political affiliation, demographics, population density, socioeconomic indicators, universal health coverage, government response stringency, and time. Our research suggests that culture fundamentally shapes how people respond to crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding cultural differences not only provides insight into the current pandemic, but also helps the world prepare for future crises.","Lu, Jackson G; Jin, Peter; English, Alexander S",Proc.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on admission rates to the delivery room and the feto-maternal unit, and to assess the effect on the nature of presenting obstetrical complaints to the emergency department. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study in one medical center. The population was women > 20 weeks pregnant who presented to the obstetrical emergency department with self-complaints during 29 days at the peak of the pandemic outbreak, and a matched group during the exact period in the previous year. We compared between the groups: clinical, obstetrical, and demographic data, including age, area of residence, gravidity, parity, previous cesarean deliveries, high-risk pregnancy follow-up, the last 30 days admissions to the obstetrical emergency department, gestational age, chief complaints, cervical dilatation, cervical effacement, admissions to the delivery room or feto-maternal unit, time from admissions to the delivery room to birth, if applicable, and acute obstetrical complications diagnosed at the emergency department. RESULTS: During the pandemic outbreak, 398 women met study inclusion criteria, compared to 544 women in the matched period of the previous year. During the COVID-19 period, women visited the obstetrical emergency department at a more advanced mean gestational age (37.6 ± 3.7 vs. 36.7 ± 4.6, p = .001). Higher proportions of women in the COVID-19 cohort presented in active labor, defined by cervical dilation of at least 5 cm on admission to the labor ward [37 (9.3%) vs 28 (5.1%), p = .013)] and with premature rupture of membranes [82 (20.6%) vs 60 (11.0%), p < .001)], and consequently with more admissions to the delivery room [198 (49.7%) vs 189 (34.7%), p < .001)]. We also recorded a significant increase in urgent obstetrical events in the emergency department during the recorded COVID-19 pandemic [23 (5.8%) vs 12 (2.2%)), p = .004]. However, the rates of neonatal and maternal morbidity did not change. During the outbreak the proportion of visits during the night was higher than during the matched period of the previous year: [138 (34.7%) vs 145 (26.6%)), p = .008]. In a multivariate logistic regression, the higher rates of admission to the delivery room during active labor and of urgent events during the pandemic outbreak compared to the matched period in the previous year remained statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 caused a behavioral change among women who presented to the obstetrical emergency department. This was characterized by delayed arrival to the obstetrical emergency department and the delivery room, which led to a significant increase in urgent and acute interventions. The change in behavior did not affect the rates of maternal and neonatal morbidity.","Kugelman, Nir; Lavie, Ofer; Assaf, Wisam; Cohen, Nadav; Sagi-Dain, Lena; Bardicef, Mordehai; Kedar, Reuven; Damti, Amit; Segev, Yakir",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,157,24

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the psychometric properties of the COVID-19 Fear Scale for Perinatal Period (EMC19-9) METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study with 204 pregnant women. Participants were recruited online through social networks. The criteria for participation in the research were: pregnant and aged 18 years or older. An electronic form was filled out, which included the preliminary Portuguese version of the COVID-19 Fear Scale (EMC19), containing the seven items in the original version and the two additional items related to pregnancy and baby, socio-demographic, psychosocial and related to pregnancy, as well as the validated Brazilian versions of the Perinatal Depression Screening Scale and the Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale. The SPSS version 26 statistical package was used. For parametric measures, Pearson's coefficient and Student's T and non-parametric - Mann Whitney's U. And the magnitude of the correlation coefficients with perinatal anxiety and depression symptoms, Cohen's criteria. AMOS 26.0 was used for confirmatory factor analysis. For internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS: The results indicate that EMC-19-9 is a one-dimensional construct, has robust psychometric qualities, very good internal consistency of the questionnaire and shows convergent validity, has a moderate and significant correlation with perinatal anxiety and a significant, albeit slight, correlation with perinatal depression. CONCLUSION: the Covid-19 Fear Scale for the Perinatal Period (EMC-19-9) has robust psychometric qualities and convergent validity. EMC-19-9 is a reliable and valid tool to assess the severity of fear of COVID-19 among women in the perinatal period in Brazil.","Barros, Monalisa Nascimento dos; Aguiar, Marcella Moreira; Carvalho, Frederica; Macedo, António; Pereira, Ana Telma",J.

We compared characteristics and severe outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the United States between early and later in the pandemic categorized by groups at higher risk of severe COVID-19. METHODS: Observational study of sampled patients aged &#8805;18 years who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to one of 14 academic hospitals in the United States during March-June and October-December 2020. Demographic and clinical information were gathered from electronic health record data. RESULTS: Among 647 patients, 91% met &#8805;1 of the following risk factors for severe COVID-19 [91% March-June (n=434); 90% October-December (n=213)]; 19% were LTCF residents, 45% were aged &#8805;65-years, and 84% had &#8805;1 high-risk condition. The proportion of patients who resided in a LTCF declined significantly (25% vs. 6%) from early to later pandemic periods. Compared with patients at lower risk for severe COVID-19, in-hospital mortality was higher among patients at high risk for severe COVID-19 (20% vs. 7%); these differences were consistently observed between March-June and October-December. CONCLUSIONS: Most adults hospitalized with COVID-19 were those recommended to be prioritized for vaccination based on risk for developing severe COVID-19. These findings highlight the urgency to vaccinate patients at high risk for severe COVID-19 and monitor vaccination impact on hospitalizations and outcomes.","Sami, Samira; Tenforde, Mark W; Talbot, H Keipp; Lindsell, Christopher J; Steingrub, Jay S; Shapiro, Nathan I; Ginde, Adit A; Douin, David J; Prekker, Matthew E; Erickson, Heidi L; Brown, Samuel M; Peltan, Ithan D; Gong, Michelle N; Khan, Akram; Exline, Matthew C; Files, D Clark; Gibbs, Kevin W; Rice, Todd W; Casey, Jonathan D; Grijalva, Carlos G; Stubblefield, William B; Womack, Kelsey N; Hager, David N; Qadir, Nida; Chang, Steven Y; Henning, Daniel J; Wilson, Jennifer G; Self, Wesley H; Patel, Manish M",Clin. infect. dis,157,24

Limitations to these applications still exist due in part to the need for more robust structural support, organization, and electromechanical function of engineered cardiac tissues. It is well accepted that heterotypic cellular interactions impact the phenotype of cardiomyocytes. The current study evaluates the functional effects of coculturing adult human cardiac fibroblasts (hCFs) in 3D engineered tissues on excitation and contraction with the goal of recapitulating healthy, nonarrhythmogenic myocardium in vitro. A small population (5% of total cell number) of hCFs in tissues improves tissue formation, material properties, and contractile function. However, two perturbations to the hCF population create disease-like phenotypes in engineered cardiac tissues. First, increasing the percentage of hCFs to 15% resulted in tissues with increased ectopic activity and spontaneous excitation rate. Second, hCFs undergo myofibroblast activation in traditional two-dimensional culture, and this altered phenotype ablated the functional benefits of hCFs when incorporated into engineered cardiac tissues. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that human cardiac fibroblast number and activation state modulate electromechanical function of hiPSC-cardiomyocytes and that a low percentage of quiescent hCFs are a valuable cell source to advance a healthy electromechanical response of engineered cardiac tissue for regenerative medicine applications.","Rupert, Cassady E; Kim, Tae Yun; Choi, Bum-Rak; Coulombe, Kareen L K",Stem Cells Int,157,16

Key questions include when, why, how, in which contexts, for which behaviours, in what combinations, compared with what, and for whom behaviour change techniques are typically effective. The aims of the present paper are to: (1) articulate the scope of the challenge in understanding the properties of behaviour change techniques, (2) propose means by which to tackle this problem, and (3) call scientists to action. METHODS: Iterative consensus (O'Connor et al., 2020, Br. J. Psychol., e12468) was used to elicit and distil the judgements of experts on how best to tackle the problem of understanding the nature and operation of behaviour change techniques. RESULTS: We propose a worldwide network of 'Centres for Understanding Behaviour Change' (CUBiC) simultaneously undertaking research to establish what are the single and combined properties of behaviour change techniques across multiple behaviours and populations. We additionally provide a first attempt to systematize an approach that CUBiC could use to understand behaviour change techniques and to begin to harness the efforts of researchers worldwide. CONCLUSION: Better understanding of behaviour change techniques is vital for improving behaviour change interventions to tackle global problems such as obesity and recovery from COVID-19. The CUBiC proposal is just one of many possible solutions to the problems that the world faces and is a call to action for scientists to work collaboratively to gain deeper understanding of the underpinnings of behaviour change interventions.","Armitage, Christopher J; Conner, Mark; Prestwich, Andrew; de Bruin, Marijn; Johnston, Marie; Sniehotta, Falko; Epton, Tracy",Br. j. health psychol,157,24

The academic workload on students can cause exhaustion, similar to that of a worker. The Maslach Burnout Inventory- Student Survey (MBI-SS) was designed to reflect student burnout by evaluation of emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and academic efficacy. It has been reported that at least half of the students will suffer burnout at some point in their medical studies. Burnout evaluation has been focused on physicians or those working in hospitals attending coronavirus patients. The psychological burden and pressures on students due to the closure of facilities and schools around the world has not been thoroughly evaluated. The objective was to evaluate the prevalence of burnout in medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods A cross-sectional, prospective, and descriptive study was performed. The MBI-SS was applied during the spring semester to all anatomy students of one of the largest medical schools in Mexico. The study was previously reviewed and approved by the Ethics and Research Committees to be answered anonymously and voluntarily. Results were classified as low, moderate, or high in emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and academic effectiveness. Results A total of 154 students participated in the survey, with a mean age of 18.9 years, 60.4% (n = 93) were women. Based on the MBI-SS definition, 14.9% (n = 23) were identified with symptoms of burnout. There was also a high prevalence of emotional exhaustion (53.9% n = 83), cynicism (16.9% n = 26), and low academic effectiveness (34.4% n = 53). Men were statistically more prevalent towards lower academic effectiveness (p = 0.037) and increased cynicism (p = 0.003), as well as a higher incidence of burnout (26.6% vs 7.5%, p = 0.001). Conclusions Burnout prevalence among medical students has been reported as high as 46% during the pandemic, however different types of surveys have been used. A previous study using the same survey reported a prevalence of 5.2% for moderate burnout syndrome, in a similar population which could indicate the COVID-19 pandemic as an influencing factor. Universities need to consider the psychological effects of the pandemic on students, and provide guidance of support alternatives to improve mental health, due to the impact this syndrome may cause on the quality of life.","Jezzini-Martinez, Sofía Quiroga-Garza Alejandro Jacobo-Baca Guillermo Guzman-Lopez Santos Salinas-Alvarez Yolanda Martinez-Garza Javier Zarate-Garza Pablo Gutierrez-De la O Jorge de la Fuente-Villarreal David Elizondo-Omaña Rodrigo",The FASEB Journal,157,16

It is known that university studies can influence the mental health of students, and especially those studying health sciences. In this study, we therefore sought to analyse whether the current pandemic has affected the mental well-being of final-year nursing students. This was a multi-centre study, with a descriptive, longitudinal, and prospective design. Mental well-being was evaluated using the General Health Questionnaire. A total of 305 participants were included in the study, of whom 52.1% had experienced the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistically significant differences were found between the two groups analysed in terms of age, access to university, average marks, mental well-being self-esteem, emotional exhaustion, and sense of coherence. In the case of mental well-being, a direct association was found with both the pandemic situation (OR = 2.32, P = 0.010) and emotional exhaustion scores (OR = 1.20, P < 0.001), while an inverse association was found with sense of coherence scores (OR = 0.45, P < 0.001). This study shows that the mental health of students is a significant factor and one that must be taken into consideration when training nursing staff at university. There is a need to promote healthy habits and provide appropriate coping strategies. It is also important to train and prepare students for pandemic situations as these can have an important impact on the mental health of both the members of the public who will be treated by these future nursing professionals and the students themselves.","Reverté-Villarroya, Sílvia; Ortega, Laura; Lavedán, Ana; Masot, Olga; Burjalés-Martí, Maria Dolors; Ballester-Ferrando, David; Fuentes-Pumarola, Concepció; Botigué, Teresa",Int. j. ment. health nurs,157,16

Nutritional requirements of three major bovine mastitis pathogens Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Streptococcus uberis (S. uberis) were investigated in vitro. We used ultra-high temperature (UHT) treated milk with different contents of fat, protein, and carbohydrates to test the influence of the availability of various milk constituents on pathogen growth characteristics. Additionally, the bacterial growth was investigated under experimentally modified nutrient availability by dilution and subsequent supplementation with individual nutrients (carbohydrates, different nitrogen sources, minerals, and different types of B vitamins) either to milk or to a conventional medium (thioglycolate broth, TB). Varying contents of fat, protein or lactose did not affect bacterial growth with the exception of growth of S. uberis being promoted in protein-enriched milk. The addition of nutrients to diluted whole milk and TB partly revealed different effects, indicating that there are media-specific growth limiting factors after dilution. Supplementation of minerals to diluted milk did not affect growth rates of all studied bacteria. Bacterial growth in diluted whole milk was decreased by the addition of high concentrations of amino acids in S. aureus, and by urea and additional B vitamins in E. coli and S. aureus. The growth rate of S. uberis was increased by the addition of B vitamins to diluted whole milk. The present results demonstrate that growth-limiting nutrients differ among pathogen types. Because reduced bacterial growth was only shown in diluted milk or TB, it is unlikely that alterations in nutrient availability occurring as a consequence of physiological changes of milk composition in the cow's udder would directly affect the susceptibility or course of bovine mastitis.","Stürmlin, Remo; Gross, Josef J; Wellnitz, Olga; Wagner, Lea A; Monney, Camille; Oevermann, Anna; Bruckmaier, Rupert M",J Dairy Res,157,1

Many countries are facing a second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. A pressing need is evident for the development of a potent vaccine to control the SARS-CoV-2. Institutions and companies in many countries have announced their vaccine research programs and progress against the COVID-19. While most vaccines go through the designation and preparation stages, some of them are under evaluation for efficacy among animal models and clinical trials, and three approved vaccine candidates have been introduced for limited exploitation in Russia and China. An effective vaccine must induce a protective response of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity and should meet the safety and efficacy criteria. Although the emergence of new technologies has accelerated the development of vaccines, there are several challenges on the way, such as limited knowledge about the pathophysiology of the virus, inducing humoral or cellular immunity, immune enhancement with animal coronavirus vaccines, and lack of an appropriate animal model. In this review, we firstly discuss the immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 disease, subsequently, give an overview of several vaccine platforms for SARS-CoV-2 under clinical trials and challenges in vaccine development against this virus.","Hosseini, Seyede Atefe; Zahedipour, Fatemeh; Mirzaei, Hamed; Kazemi Oskuee, Reza",Int Immunopharmacol,157,6

The hypothesis of the present study is that attending lessons in Greek traditional dance is an effective method for managing anxiety and stress in patients diagnosed with cancer of any type both during and after treatment. The study was conducted on 300 cancer patients (150 experimental subjects, 150 controls) selected by Attica hospitals and nonprofit cancer patients' organizations. Each patient in the experimental group attended an 8-week Greek traditional dance lesson program. Lessons were held twice per week, lasting 60 min each. A similar group of cancer patients not participating in any organized physical activity during the same time period served as a control group. Data were collected using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 (Dass-21) questionnaire and subjected to reliability analysis (Cronbach's alpha) and deviation-dependent analysis (one-way repeated). Both stress and anxiety values decreased significantly in the experimental group (stress value: initial mean = 16.27, second mean = 2.58, final mean = 6.77, p < 0.001; anxiety value: initial mean = 15.59, second mean = 2.81, final mean = 5.35, p < 0.001). In contrast, no significant fluctuation was observed in the control group. Thus, there was a significant decrease in stress and anxiety values in cancer patients who attended Greek traditional dances lessons with important psychotherapeutic significance.","Karathanou, Ioanna; Bebetsos, E; Filippou, F; Psirri, A; Konas, I",J. cancer educ,157,16

To date, measurement of this distress has largely been by means of validated assessment tools. We believe that qualitative data may provide a richer view of staff experiences during this pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study using online and written questionnaires to all ICU staff which consisted of validated tools to measure psychological distress (quantitative findings) and open-ended questions with free-text boxes (qualitative findings). Here, we report our qualitative findings. We asked four questions to explore causes of stress, need for supports and barriers to accessing supports. A conventional content analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: In total, 269 of the 408 respondents (65.9%) gave at least one response to a free-text question. Seven overarching themes were found, which contribute to our proposed model for occupational stress amongst critical care staff. The work environment played an important role in influencing the perceived psychological impact on healthcare workers. Extra-organisational factors, which we termed the ""home-work interface"" and uncertainty about the future, manifested as anticipatory anxiety, had a proportionally larger influence on worker well-being than would be expected in non-pandemic conditions. CONCLUSION: Our findings have important implications for appropriate allocation of resources and ensuring well-being of the ICU multidisciplinary team for this and future pandemics.","Feeley, T; Ffrench-O039,; Carroll, R; Tan, M H; Magner, C; L039,; Estrange, K; O039,; Rathallaigh, E; Whelan, S; Lyons, B; Connor, E",Int. arch. occup. environ. health,157,23

However, its environmental consequences are poorly understood. Thus, to assess whether COVID-19 therapy based on the use of azithromycin (AZT) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) during the pandemic affects wild aquatic life, we exposed (for 72 h) neotropical tadpoles of the species Physalaemus cuvieri to the water containing these drugs to 12.5 µg/L. We observed that the increase in superoxide dismutase and catalase in tadpoles exposed to AZT (alone or in combination with HCQ) was predominant to keep the production of NO, ROS, TBARS and H2O2 equitable between the experimental groups. In addition, the uptake of AZT and the strong interaction of AZT with acetylcholinesterase (AChE), predicted by the molecular docking analysis, were associated with the anticholinesterase effect observed in the groups exposed to the antibiotic. However, the unexpected increase in butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in these same groups suggests its constitutive role in maintaining cholinergic homeostasis. Therefore, taken together, our data provide a pioneering evidence that the exposure of P. cuvieri tadpoles to AZT (alone or in combination with HCQ) in a predictably increased environmental concentration (12.5 µg/L) elicits a compensatory adaptive response that can have, in the short period of exposure, guaranteed the survival of the animals. However, the high energy cost for maintaining physiological homeostasis, can compromise the growth and development of animals and, therefore, in the medium-long term, have a general negative effect on the health of animals. Thus, it is possible that COVID-19 therapy, based on the use of AZT, affects wild aquatic life, which requires greater attention to the impacts that this drug may represent.","da Luz, Thiarlen Marinho; Araújo, Amanda Pereira da Costa; Estrela, Fernanda Neves; Braz, Helyson Lucas Bezerra; Jorge, Roberta Jeane Bezerra; Charlie-Silva, Ives; Malafaia, Guilherme",Sci Total Environ,157,1

Demographic information (age, gender, education level, place of residence and occupation), anthropometric data (reported weight and height);nutritional behavior information (number of meals per day, changes in consumption of various foods, use of nutritional supplements, etc.) and changes in lifestyle habits were requested from the participations. In addition, the Healthy Nutrition Attitude Scale (ASHN) was used to determine the healthy eating attitudes of the participants.A total of 432 volunteers participated in the study. It was revealed that body weight increased in 38.0%of the participants and activity level decreased in 73.1%of them during the initial stage of the pandemic. Nevertheless, 44.7%of participants reported increased sleep time, 77.8%reported increased social media use, and 66.7%reported increased stress and anxiety. It was found that the most commonly used nutritional supplements during this period were vitamin C, vitamin D and multivitamin complex. Women have significantly higher ASHN scores compared to men (p &lt; 0.001). The total ASHN scores of those whose body weight did not change and those who increased their activity level were found to be significantly higher. It was determined that as the age and education level increased, the healthy eating attitude increased. In this study, findings regarding the negative effects of the Covid 19 quarantine on the nutrition and lifestyle of the Turkish people are presented. However, those with a positive attitude toward healthy eating were observed to have better weight control and eating habits and stress management during the pandemic. Therefore, it is thought that the dissemination of healthy eating attitudes in society may contribute to the maintenance of physical and mental health in the event of a pandemic.

Herein, the various exposures contributing to a person's exposome are collectively considered social determinants of health (SDOH), and the SDOH-exposome impacts health more than health care. This review discusses the extent of evidence of the physiologic consequences of these exposures at the intracellular level. We consider how the SDOH-exposome, which captures how individuals live, work and age, induces cell processes that modulate a conceptual ""redox rheostat."" Like an electrical resistor, the SDOH-exposome, along with genetic predisposition and age, regulate reductive and oxidative (redox) stress circuits and thereby stimulate inflammation. Regardless of the source of the SDOH-exposome that induces chronic inflammation and immunosenescence, the outcome influences cardiometabolic diseases, cancers, infections, sepsis, neurodegeneration and autoimmune diseases. The endogenous redox rheostat is connected with regulatory molecules such as NAD+/NADH and SIRT1 that drive redox pathways. In addition to these intracellular and mitochondrial processes, we discuss how the SDOH-exposome can influence the balance between metabolism and regulation of immune responsiveness involving the two main molecular drivers of inflammation, the NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-&#954;B induction. Mitochondrial and inflammasome activities play key roles in mediating defenses against pathogens and controlling inflammation before diverse cell death pathways are induced. Specifically, pyroptosis, cell death by inflammation, is intimately associated with common disease outcomes that are influenced by the SDOH-exposome. Redox influences on immunometabolism including protein cysteines and ion fluxes are discussed regarding health outcomes. In summary, this review presents a translational research perspective, with evidence from in vitro and in vivo models as well as clinical and epidemiological studies, to outline the intracellular consequences of the SDOH-exposome that drive health disparities in patients and populations. The relevance of this conceptual and theoretical model considering the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are highlighted. Finally, the case of asthma is presented as a chronic condition that is modified by adverse SDOH exposures and is manifested through the dysregulation of immune cell redox regulatory processes we highlight in this review.","Emeny, Rebecca T; Carpenter, David O; Lawrence, David A",Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,157,25

An online survey was distributed through social networks during forced home confinement, collecting data from1298 participants of 19 different Italian regions. Chronotype was evaluated using the reduced version of the Morningness/Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ); sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); resilience levels were measured by the 10-item version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC10); post-traumatic stress reactions were assessed by the 6-item version of the Impact of Event Scale (IES6). Resilience and sleep quality were significantly lower in the evening compared to non-evening types, as well as in females as compared to males. Moreover, resilience was negatively correlated with post-traumatic stress reactions and positively correlated with sleep quality. A negative correlation was also reported between sleep quality and post-traumatic stress reactions. Sleep quality was identified as a possible mediator between chronotype and resilience, and between resilience and post-traumatic stress reactions, after controlling for age and sex. These findings provide new insights into the role of chronotype in adapting to continuous stressful situations. Sleep quality seems to mediate the causal path between the antecedents of resilience and the development of trauma.

We discuss data limitations together with similarities and differences of the regional context possibly affecting COVID-19 control in the two regions.

METHODS: We conducted a cohort study between March and May 2020 at the Lille University Hospital (France), including all patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Psychological distress symptoms were measured 3 weeks after onset of COVID-19 symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-6 items (IES-6). The evaluation of PTSD symptoms using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) took place 1 month later. Bivariate analyses were performed to analyze the relationship between PCL-5 scores and the demographic and health variables. The significant variables were then introduced into a multivariable linear regression analysis to establish their relative contributions to the severity of PTSD symptoms. RESULTS: 180 patients were included in this study, and 138 patients completed the 2 evaluations. Among the 180 patients, 70.4% patients required hospitalization, and 30.7% were admitted to the intensive care unit. The prevalence of PTSD was 6.5%, and the predictive factors of PTSD included psychological distress at the onset of the illness and a stay in an intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PTSD in patients with COVID-19 is not as high as that reported among patients during previous epidemics. Initial psychological responses were predictive of a PTSD diagnosis, even though most patients showing acute psychological distress (33.5% of the sample) improved in the following weeks. PTSD symptoms also increased following a stay in an intensive care unit.

The question of whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect the kidney is relevant to the understanding of pathogenesis of acute kidney injury and collapsing glomerulopathy in COVID-19. Methodologies to document SARS-CoV-2 infection that have been used include immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in situ hybridization and electron microscopy. In our review of studies to date we found that SARS-CoV-2 in the kidney of patients with COVID-19 was detected in 18 of 94 (19%) by immuno-histochemistry, 71 of 144 (49%) by RT-PCR and 11 of 84 (13%) by in situ hybridization. In a smaller number of patients with COVID-19 examined by immunofluorescence, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 10 of 13 (77%). In total, in kidneys from 102 of 235 patients (43.4%), the presence of SARS-CoV-2 was suggested by at least one of the methods used. Despite these positive findings, caution is needed as many other studies have been negative for SARS-CoV-2 presence and it should be noted that when detected it was only in kidneys obtained at autopsy. There is a clear need for studies from kidney biopsies, including those performed at early stages of the COVID-19 associated kidney disease. Development of tests to detect kidney viral infection in urine samples would be more practical as a non-invasive way to evaluate SARS CoV-2 infection during the evolution of COVID-19-associated kidney disease.","Hassler, Luise; Reyes, Fabiola; Sparks, Matthew; Welling, Paul; Batlle, Daniel",Clin. j. am. soc. nephrol,157,10

We aimed to investigate the effects of two levels of PEEP on alveolar recruitment in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A single-center cohort study was conducted in a 39-bed intensive care unit at a university-affiliated hospital in Genoa, Italy. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed to quantify aeration at 8 and 16 cmH2O PEEP. The primary endpoint was the amount of alveolar recruitment, defined as the change in the non-aerated compartment at the two PEEP levels on CT scan. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were included in this analysis. Alveolar recruitment was median [interquartile range] 2.7 [0.7-4.5] % of lung weight and was not associated with excess lung weight, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, respiratory system compliance, inflammatory and thrombophilia markers. Patients in the upper quartile of recruitment (recruiters), compared to non-recruiters, had comparable clinical characteristics, lung weight and gas volume. Alveolar recruitment was not different in patients with lower versus higher respiratory system compliance. In a subgroup of 20 patients with available gas exchange data, increasing PEEP decreased respiratory system compliance (median difference, MD - 9 ml/cmH2O, 95% CI from - 12 to - 6 ml/cmH2O, p < 0.001) and the ventilatory ratio (MD - 0.1, 95% CI from - 0.3 to - 0.1, p = 0.003), increased PaO2 with FiO2 = 0.5 (MD 24 mmHg, 95% CI from 12 to 51 mmHg, p < 0.001), but did not change PaO2 with FiO2 = 1.0 (MD 7 mmHg, 95% CI from - 12 to 49 mmHg, p = 0.313). Moreover, alveolar recruitment was not correlated with improvement of oxygenation or venous admixture. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, higher PEEP resulted in limited alveolar recruitment. These findings suggest limiting PEEP strictly to the values necessary to maintain oxygenation, thus avoiding the use of higher PEEP levels.","Ball, Lorenzo; Robba, Chiara; Maiello, Lorenzo; Herrmann, Jacob; Gerard, Sarah E; Xin, Yi; Battaglini, Denise; Brunetti, Iole; Minetti, Giuseppe; Seitun, Sara; Vena, Antonio; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Bassetti, Matteo; Rocco, Patricia R M; Cereda, Maurizio; Castellan, Lucio; Patroniti, Nicolò; Pelosi, Paolo",Crit Care,157,24

Therefore, the aims of this study were (a) to explore consumption habits in students at four Spanish universities by analysing their individual ecological footprint (EF); (b) to develop indices of connection with nature and a pro-environmental attitude and to determine relationships between these indices and students' consumption. Among other factors, our results showed that private university students have a higher EF than public university students; that food consumption has the greatest impact on individuals' EF; and that those who consume more sustainably do not show a more pro-environmental attitude or feel a greater connection with nature. Therefore, we conclude that there was no apparent direct relationship between study participants' convictions and their daily behaviour.

Aim: To evaluate psychiatric emergencies in a 6-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 compared to those of the corresponding period of the previous year. Methods: This monocentric observational study preliminarily collected variables of the urgent psychiatric consultations (UPCs) carried out in emergency room (ER) from 1-3-2020 to 31-8-2020 and the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who required UPCs in the 6-month period, comparing these data with those collected from 1-3-2019 to 31-8-2019. The data, collected in alpha-numeric code, were statistically analyzed through STATA 12-2011. Results: This research reported a reduction of both UPCs and hospital psychiatric admissions. Concomitantly, we observed an increase of UPCs required by people already being treated by psychiatric and other health services, residents in psychiatric facilities and non-Italians. In 2020, differently from 2019, the most frequent reasons for urgent psychiatric consultations were aggressive behavior and adjustment disorders with anxiety and depressive mood. Conclusion: This preliminary study suggests that, during the COVID-19 epidemic, urgent psychiatric consultations in ER were reduced, except for the most vulnerable people due to their clinical and/or social conditions.","Di Lorenzo, R.; Frattini, N.; Dragone, D.; Farina, R.; Luisi, F.; Ferrari, S.; Bandiera, G.; Rovesti, S.; Ferri, P.",Neuropsychiatric Disease &amp; Treatment,157,32

Three weeks of 11KT treatment did not affect target gene expression, but a tendency for a time-dependent decrease of lhr and dmrt1 mRNA levels was observed in both treatment and placebo groups. By 8 weeks of treatment, however, 11KT implants provoked the upregulation of fshr and foxl2 transcript levels. Furthermore, lhr and dmrt1 transcript abundances recovered by 8 weeks of exposure in both blank- and 11KT-implanted beluga. These results suggest that 11KT, either directly or indirectly, may affect gametogenesis and regulate some key components of the reproductive axis in female beluga.

The use of a handheld device in this scenario has not been addressed. Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility of QTc monitoring with a smart device in COVID-19 patients receiving QTc-interfering therapies. Methods: Prospective study of consecutive COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin ± lopinavir-ritonavir. ECG monitoring was performed with 12-lead ECG or with KardiaMobile-6L. Both registries were also sequentially obtained in a cohort of healthy patients. We evaluated differences in QTc in COVID-19 patients between three different monitoring strategies: 12-lead ECG at baseline and follow-up (A), 12-lead ECG at baseline and follow-up with the smart device (B), and fully monitored with handheld 6-lead ECG (group C). Time needed to obtain an ECG registry was also documented. Results: One hundred and eighty-two COVID-19 patients were included (A: 119(65.4%); B: 50(27.5%); C: 13(7.1%). QTc peak during hospitalization did significantly increase in all groups. No differences were observed between the three monitoring strategies in QTc prolongation (p = 0.864). In the control group, all but one ECG registry with the smart device allowed QTc measurement and mean QTc did not differ between both techniques (p = 0.612), displaying a moderate reliability (ICC 0.56 [0.19-0.76]). Time of ECG registry was significantly longer for the 12-lead ECG than for handheld device in both cohorts (p < 0.001). Conclusion: QTc monitoring with KardiaMobile-6L in COVID-19 patients was feasible. Time of ECG registration was significantly lower with the smart device, which may offer an important advantage for prevention of virus dissemination among healthcare providers.","Minguito-Carazo, Carlos; Echarte-Morales, Julio; Benito-González, Tomás; Del Castillo-García, Samuel; Rodríguez-Santamarta, Miguel; Sánchez-Muñoz, Enrique; Maniega, Clea González; García-Bergel, Rubén; Menéndez-Suárez, Paula; Prieto-González, Silvia; Palacios-Echavarren, Carmen; Borrego-Rodríguez, Javier; Flores-Vergara, Guisela; Iglesias-Garriz, Ignacio; Fernández-Vázquez, Felipe",Glob Heart,157,30

Therefore, we performed a systematic review to summarize the clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of heart transplant recipients with COVID-19. We searched electronic databases from inception to January 11, 2021. Thirty-nine articles (22 case reports and 17 cohorts) involving 415 patients were included. The mean age was 59.9 ± 15.7 years and 77% of patients were men. In cohort studies including outpatients and inpatients, the hospitalization rate was 77%. The most common symptoms were fever (70%) and cough (67%). Inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein and procalcitonin) were above the normal range. Forty-eight percent of patients presented with severe or critical COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine (54%), azithromycin (14%), and lopinavir/ritonavir (14%) were the most commonly used drugs. Forty-nine percent of patients discontinued the baseline regimen of antimetabolites. In contrast, 59% and 73% continued the same regimen of calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids, respectively. Short-term mortality among cohorts limited to inpatients was 25%.

However, there are no self-care measures to screen self-care activities in general population and which, could be briefly in a lockdown situation. This research aims to build and validate a psychometric tool to screen self-care activities in general population. METHODS: Firstly, an exploratory factor analysis was performed in a sample of 226 participants to discover the underlying factorial structure and to reduce the number of items in the original tool into a significant pool of items related to self-care. Later a confirmatory factor analyses were performed in a new sample of 261 participants to test for the fit and goodness of factor solutions. Internal validity, reliability, and convergent validity between its score with perceived stress and psychological well-being measures were examined on this sample. RESULTS: The exploratory analyses suggested a four-factor solution, corresponding to health consciousness, nutrition and physical activity, sleep, and intra-personal and inter-personal coping skills (14 items). Then, the four-factor structure was confirmed as the best model fit for self-care activities. The tool demonstrated good reliability, predictive validity of individuals' perception of coping with COVID-19 lockdown, and convergent validity with well-being and perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS: This screening tool could be helpful to address future evaluations and interventions to promote healthy behaviours. Likewise, this tool can be targeted to specific population self-care's needs during a scalable situation.","Martínez, Martín; Luis, Elkin O; Oliveros, Edwin Yair; Fernández-Berrocal, Pablo; Sarrionandia, Ainize; Vidaurreta, Marta; Bermejo-Martins, Elena",Health Qual Life Outcomes,157,15

Gut commensal bacteria maintain a symbiotic relationship with the host and display a critical function in the homeostasis of the host immune system. Disturbance to the gut microbiota leads to immune dysfunction both locally and at distant sites, which causes inflammatory conditions not only in the intestine but also in the other organs such as lungs and brain, and may induce a disease state. Probiotics are well known to reinforce immunity and counteract inflammation by restoring symbiosis within the gut microbiota. As a result, probiotics protect against various diseases, including respiratory infections and neuroinflammatory disorders. A growing body of research supports the beneficial role of probiotics in lung and mental health through modulating the gut-lung and gut-brain axes. In the current paper, we discuss the potential role of probiotics in the treatment of viral respiratory infections, including the COVID-19 disease, as major public health crisis in 2020, and influenza virus infection, as well as treatment of neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis and other mental illnesses.","Shahbazi, Roghayeh; Yasavoli-Sharahi, Hamed; Alsadi, Nawal; Ismail, Nafissa; Matar, Chantal",Molecules (Basel),157,23

Incorporating this biomass function into a stoichiometric metabolic model of the human lung cell and applying metabolic flux balance analysis, we identified host-based metabolic perturbations inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 reproduction. Our results highlight reactions in the central metabolism, as well as amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways. By incorporating host cellular maintenance into the model based on available protein expression data from human lung cells, we find that only few of these metabolic perturbations are able to selectively inhibit virus reproduction. Some of the catalysing enzymes of such reactions have demonstrated interactions with existing drugs, which can be used for experimental testing of the presented predictions using gene knockouts and RNA interference techniques. In summary, the developed computational approach offers a platform for rapid, experimentally testable generation of drug predictions against existing and emerging viruses based on their biomass requirements.","Delattre, Hadrien; Sasidharan, Kalesh; Soyer, Orkun S",,157,26

SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to cause both direct and indirect brain vascular endothelial damage through infection and inflammation that may result in long-term neurological signs and symptoms. We sought to illuminate persistent neuro-ophthalmological deficits that may be seen following posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) due to COVID-19. METHODS: We identified three individuals with PRES due to COVID-19 in our hospital system. One patient was identified on presentation to our neuro-ophthalmology clinic. The other patients were identified through internal records search. These cases were compared to published reports of PRES in COVID-19 identified through systematic literature search of PubMed/LitCOVID. RESULTS: All three patients were hospitalized with severe COVID-19 and developed altered mental status with new onset seizures that led to the recognition of PRES through diagnostic imaging. During recovery, two patients had persistent visual dysfunction including visual field deficits. One patient also experienced hallucinatory palinopsia and visual hallucinations. Literature search identified 32 other cases of PRES in the context of COVID-19. Visual disturbances were described in 14 cases (40%), with only seven cases (50%) reporting full recovery by the time of publication. CONCLUSIONS: As we learn about enduring neurological complications of COVID-19, it is possible that complications may be underrecognized and underreported. Understanding the range of complications can help in postcare evaluation and management changes in the critical care setting to potentially allow intervention before persistent deficits occur due to COVID-19.","Hixon, Alison M; Thaker, Ashesh A; Pelak, Victoria S",Eur. j. neurol,157,29

METHODS AND RESULTS: Herein, we reported the isolation of A. terreus, the endophytic fungus associated with soybean roots, which is then subcultured using OSMAC approach in five different culture media. Analytical analysis of media ethylacetate extracts using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) was carried out. Furthermore, the obtained LC-MS data were statistically processed with MetaboAnalyst 4.0. Molecular docking studies were performed for the dereplicated metabolites against COVID-19 main protease (Mpro ). Metabolomic profiling revealed the presence of 18 compounds belonging to different chemical classes. Quinones, polyketides and isocoumarins were the most abundant classes. Multivariate analysis revealed that potato dextrose broth and modified potato dextrose broth are the optimal media for metabolites production. Molecular docking studies declared that the metabolites, Aspergillide B1 and 3a-Hydroxy-3, 5-dihydromonacolin L showed the highest binding energy scores towards COVID-19 main protease (Mpro ) (-9·473) and (-9·386), respectively, and they interact strongly with the catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145) amino acid residues of Mpro .

To understand the role of aerosols in disease transmission, we adopted a prospective cross-sectional study design and investigated the count and size distribution of aerosols generated by a non-contact tonometer and its correlation with individual tear film characteristics. METHODS: This study constituted two parts. The study population included outpatients who underwent an intraocular pressure examination in an intraocular pressure examination room (Part I) and 20 participants who underwent an intraocular pressure examination in a laboratory (Part II). The following main outcomes were measured: aerosol counts at 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 cm from the non-contact tonometer (Part I); aerosol counts after each participant underwent non-contact tonometry, and lipid layer thickness score and tear film break-up time (Part II). RESULTS: The aerosol count decreased with increasing distance from the tonometer. The aerosol count at 0 cm had the highest value compared to that at other distances. For aerosols of diameters 0.25-0.5 µm and 0.5-1.0 µm, the count decreased at 50 cm and remained stable at further distances. For aerosols of diameters 1.0-2.5 µm and &#8805; 2.5 µm, the count dropped progressively at all five distances. The aerosol count from each tonometer correlated positively with the lipid layer thickness score (r = 0.490, P = 0.028), whereas the aerosol count correlated negatively with the tear film break-up time (r = - 0.675, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Aerosols tended to coagulate during diffusion. A 50-cm distance from the tonometer could confer safety from aerosols with < 1.0-µm diameter. Aerosols generated during non-contact tonometry could contain a lipid layer component. Moreover, tear film stability could affect aerosol generation. Protective eyewear is recommended for reducing infection risk from aerosols. Individual tear film characteristics should be considered during non-contact tonometry.","Hao, Weiting; Wu, Jianhui; Zhao, Xinheng; Liang, Danni; Yu, Xingchen; Cao, Huazheng; Wang, Yan",Adv Ther,157,1

We find that product availability falls by 10% for vegetables, fruits, and edible oils, but there is a minimal impact on their prices. On the farm-gate side, it is matched by a 20% fall in quantity arrivals of vegetables and fruits. We then show that supply chain disruption is the main driver behind this fall. We compute the distance to production zones from our retail centers and find that the fall in product availability and quantity arrivals is larger for items that are cultivated or manufactured farther from the final point of sale. Our results show that long-distance food supply chains have been hit the hardest during the current pandemic with welfare consequences for urban consumers and farmers.","Mahajan, Kanika; Tomar, Shekhar",American journal of agricultural economics,157,16

Ablation of chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor 2 (COUP-TF2) (Nr2f2), a transcription factor implicated in developmental angiogenesis, reduced endothelial proliferation, exacerbating viral lung injury in vivo. In vitro, COUP-TF2 regulates proliferation and migration through activation of cyclin D1 and neuropilin 1. Upon influenza injury, nuclear factor &#954;B suppresses COUP-TF2, but surviving endothelial cells ultimately reestablish vascular homeostasis dependent on restoration of COUP-TF2.

The expression level of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is vital for viral infection. However, the regulation of ACE2 expression on the ocular surface is still unknown. We aimed to determine the change in ACE2 expression in inflamed corneal epithelium and explore potential drugs to reduce the expression of ACE2 on the ocular surface. Methods: The expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) was examined by qPCR and Western blotting. The altered expression of ACE2 in inflammatory corneal epithelium was evaluated in TNF&#945;- and IL-1ß-stimulated HCECs and inflamed mouse corneal epithelium, and the effect of resveratrol on ACE2 expression in HCECs was detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Results: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed on the human corneal epithelial cells. ACE2 expression is upregulated in HCECs by stimulation with TNF&#945; and IL-1ß and inflamed mouse corneas, including dry eye and alkali-burned corneas. In addition, resveratrol attenuates the increased expression of ACE2 induced by TNF&#945; in HCECs. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that ACE2 is highly expressed in HCECs and can be upregulated by stimulation with inflammatory cytokines and inflamed mouse corneal epithelium. Resveratrol may be able to reduce the increased expression of ACE2 on the inflammatory ocular surface. Our work suggests that patients with an inflammatory ocular surface may display higher ACE2 expression, which increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jiang, Zhixin; Zhang, Huan; Gao, Juan; Yu, Hao; Han, Ruifang; Zhu, Lin; Chen, Xi; Fan, Qian; Hao, Peng; Wang, Liming; Li, Xuan",Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,157,26

413168,413168,413168,Interpreting a covid-19 test result,15.693972,5.154878,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic is affecting the entire world population. During the first spread, most governments have implemented quarantine and strict social distancing procedures. Similar measures during recent pandemics resulted in an increase in post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression symptoms. The development of novel interventions to mitigate the mental health burden are of utmost importance. OBJECTIVE: In this rapid review, we aimed to provide a systematic overview of the literature with regard to associations between physical activity (PA) and depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA SOURCE: We searched major databases (PubMed, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science) and preprint servers (MedRxiv, SportRxiv, ResearchGate, and Google Scholar), for relevant papers up to 25/07/2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included observational studies with cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. To qualify for inclusion in the review, studies must have tested the association of PA with depression or anxiety, using linear or logistic regressions. Depression and anxiety must have been assessed using validated rating scales. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Effect sizes were represented by fully adjusted standardized betas and odds ratios (OR) alongside 95% confidence intervals (CI). In case standardized effects could not be obtained, unstandardized effects were presented and indicated. RESULTS: We identified a total of 21 observational studies (4 longitudinal, 1 cross-sectional with retrospective analysis, and 16 cross-sectional), including information of 42,293 (age 6-70 years, median female = 68%) participants from five continents. The early evidence suggests that people who performed PA on a regular basis with higher volume and frequency and kept the PA routines stable, showed less symptoms of depression and anxiety. For instance, those reporting a higher total time spent in moderate to vigorous PA had 12-32% lower chances of presenting depressive symptoms and 15-34% of presenting anxiety. CONCLUSION: Performing PA during Covid-19 is associated with less depression and anxiety. To maintain PA routines during Covid-19, specific volitional and motivational skills might be paramount to overcome Covid-19 specific barriers. Particularly, web-based technologies could be an accessible way to increase motivation and volition for PA and maintain daily PA routines.","Wolf, Sebastian; Seiffer, Britta; Zeibig, Johanna-Marie; Welkerling, Jana; Brokmeier, Luisa; Atrott, Beatrice; Ehring, Thomas; Schuch, Felipe Barreto",Sports med,157,13

In the present study, we compared the new Immundiagnostik IDK® anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG assay with four widely-used commercial serological assays for the detection of antibodies targeting S (spike) and NC (nucleocapsid) proteins. Methods: Serum samples were taken from an unbiased group of convalescent patients and from a negative control group. Sample were simultaneously analyzed by the new Immundiagnostik IDK® anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG assay, by the DiaSorin LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay, and by the Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG ELISA. Antibodies binding NC were detected by the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and by the pan-immunoglobulin immunoassay Roche Elecsys® anti-SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we investigated samples of a group of COVID-19 convalescent subjects that were primarily tested S1 IgG non-reactive. Samples were also tested by live virus and pseudovirus neutralization tests. Results: Overall, the IDK® anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG assay showed the highest sensitivity among the evaluated spike (S) protein-based assays. Additionally, the Immundiagnostik assay correlated well with serum-neutralizing activity. Conclusions: The novel IDK® anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG assay showed high sensitivity and specificity, representing a valid option for use in the routine diagnostic.","Eberhardt, Kirsten Alexandra; Dewald, Felix; Heger, Eva; Gieselmann, Lutz; Vanshylla, Kanika; Wirtz, Maike; Kleipass, Franziska; Johannis, Wibke; Schommers, Philipp; Gruell, Henning; Brensing, Karl August; Müller, Roman-Ulrich; Augustin, Max; Lehmann, Clara; Koch, Manuel; Klein, Florian; Di Cristanziano, Veronica",,157,1

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study recruiting 120 pregnant women. The study was conducted at the outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital. We recruited women attending for antenatal care. Anxiety was evaluated using an Arabic validated Kuwait University Anxiety Scale (KUAS). Depression was evaluated using a validated Arabic form of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). RESULTS: The study included 48 (40%) nulliparous and 72 (60%) multiparous women. The mean KUAS scores for nulliparous and multiparous women were 45.27±10.78 and 47.28±10.62. Both nulliparous and multiparous women had a fairly high possibility of depression. Fifty-three (44.2%) of them reported scores &#8805; of 14. Ninety-three (77.5%) women thought that COVID-19 pandemic would affect their pregnancies. There was a significant association between the number of women reporting fear related to the COVID-19 pandemic and their KUAS and EPDS scores (p-value <0.001 each). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 affected the mental health of pregnant women to a great extent.

However, resistance poses substantial clinical challenges. METHODS: We conducted a phase I trial of CD40 agonist APX005M (sotigalimab) and CSF1R inhibitor cabiralizumab with/without nivolumab using a 3+3 dose escalation design (NCT03502330). Patients were enrolled from June 2018-April 2019. Eligibility included biopsy-proven advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients who progressed on anti-PD-1/PD-L1. APX005M was dose escalated (0.03, 0.1, or 0.3 mg/kg IV) with a fixed dose of cabiralizumab with/without nivolumab every 2 weeks until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (12 melanoma, 1 NSCLC, and 13 RCC) were enrolled in six cohorts, 17 on nivolumab-containing regimens. Median duration of follow-up was 21.3 months. The most common TRAEs were asymptomatic elevations of LDH (n=26), CK (n=25), AST (n=25), and ALT (n=19); periorbital edema (n=17), and fatigue (n=13). One DLT (acute respiratory distress syndrome) occurred in Cohort 2. RP2D was APX005M 0.3 mg/kg, cabiralizumab 4 mg/kg, and nivolumab 240 mg q2wk. Median days on treatment was 66 (range 23-443). Median cycles was 4.5 (range 2-21). One patient had unconfirmed partial response (4%), 8 stable disease (31%), 16 disease progression (62%), and 1 unevaluable (4%). Pro-inflammatory cytokines were upregulated 4 hours post-infusion. CD40 and M-CSF increased after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This first in-human study of patients with anti-PD-1/PD-L1-resistant tumors treated with dual macrophage-polarizing therapy, with or without nivolumab demonstrated safety and pharmacodynamic activity. Optimization of the dosing frequency and sequence of this combination is warranted.","Weiss, Sarah A; Djureinovic, Dijana; Jessel, Shlomit; Krykbaeva, Irina; Zhang, Lin; Jilaveanu, Lucia; Ralabate, Amanda; Johnson, Barbara; Shanwetter Levit, Neta; Anderson, Gail; Zelterman, Daniel; Wei, Wei; Mahajan, Amit; Trifan, Ovidiu; Bosenberg, Marcus; Kaech, Susan M; Perry, Curtis J; Damsky, William; Gettinger, Scott; Sznol, Mario; Hurwitz, Michael; Kluger, Harriet M",Clin. cancer res,157,16

We hypothesized that patient preparedness would be equivalent after preoperative counseling phone calls versus preoperative counseling office visits before prolapse surgery. METHODS: This was an equivalence randomized controlled trial of women undergoing pelvic organ prolapse surgery. Participants were randomized to receive standardized counseling via a preoperative phone call or office visit. The primary outcome was patient preparedness measured on a 5-point Likert scale by the Patient Preparedness Questionnaire at the postoperative visit. A predetermined equivalence margin of 20% was used. Two 1-sided tests for equivalence were used for the primary outcome. RESULTS: We randomized 120 women. The study was concluded early because of COVID-19 and subsequent surgery cancellations. There were 85 participants with primary outcome data (43 offices, 42 phones). Mean age was 62.0 years (±1.0) and 64 (75.3%) had stage III or stage IV prolapse. The primary outcome, patient preparedness measured at the postoperative visit, was equivalent between groups (office, n = 43 [97.7%]; phone, n = 42 [97.6%], P < 0.001). Most women reported they would have preferred a phone call (n = 66, 65.5%) with more women in the phone group expressing this preference than the office group (office 40.5% vs phone 90.5%, P < 0.001). Ultimately, nearly all women (96.5%) were satisfied with their method of counseling. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative counseling phone calls were equivalent to office visits for patient preparedness for pelvic organ prolapse surgery. This study demonstrates patient acceptance of phone calls for preoperative counseling.

We showed that Mexican bat-CoVs sequences are grouped into two genera, Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus, and the new coronavirus is an independent clade within Betacoronavirus. Due to the diversity of CoVs in Mexican bats, the propensity of CoVs to shift hosts, the invasion mechanisms described for this new virus, and previous reports of animals infected by SARS-CoV-2, the risk of a possible infection from humans to Mexican bats should not be discarded and warrants further analyses.

The supply of antiviral filters which form an essential part of the ventilator circuit have been affected by these issues. Three-dimensional (3D) printing may provide a solution to some of these issues. METHODS: We designed and tested 3D printed heat and moisture exchange (HME) and antiviral casing. For each casing we tested two different filter materials derived from a sediment water filter cartridge or 1.5-µm glass fiber filter paper. A polyurethane sponge was used for the HME. Each design was tested for circuit leak, circuit compliance, peak inspiratory pressure and casing integrity using methylene blue dye. RESULTS: We designed, produced, and tested two different types of antiviral filters with six different internal configurations. Overall, we tested 10 modified filter designs and compared them with the original commercial filter. Except for the combination of 1.5-µm filter paper and 5 mm sponge peak inspiratory pressure and circuit compliance of the filters produced were within the operating limits of the ventilator. All In addition, all filters passed the dye test. CONCLUSIONS: Our filter may be of particular importance to those working in low middle-income countries unable to compete with stronger economies. Our design relies on products available outside the healthcare supply chain, much of which can be purchased in grocery stores, hardware stores, or industrial and academic institutions. We hope that these HMEs and viral filters may be beneficial to clinicians who face critical supply chain issues during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shaylor, Ruth; Francis, Mathew; Shaylor, Esther; Dadia, Solomon; Cohen, Barak",BMC Anesthesiol,157,0

Such programs may help alleviate some of the detrimental impacts of social distancing and quarantine on older adults at-risk of decline. METHODS: Data were derived from the feasibility arm of a parent study, which piloted the telehealth program for 36 sessions with 1 participant. The steps involved in each phase (ie, development, delivery) were documented, along with participant and program provider considerations for each step. Time-driven activity-based costing was used to track all costs over the course of the study. Costs were categorized as program development or delivery and estimated per session and per participant. RESULTS: A list of the steps and the participant and provider considerations involved in developing and delivering a synchronous telehealth exercise program for older adults with functional impairments was developed. Resources used, fixed and variable costs, per-session cost estimates, and total cost per person were reported. Two potential measures of the ""value proposition"" of this type of intervention were also reported. Per-session cost of $158 appeared to be a feasible business case, especially if the physical therapist to trained assistant personnel mix could be improved. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide insight into the process and costs of developing and delivering telehealth exercise programs for older adults with functional impairments. The information presented may provide a ""blue print"" for developing and implementing new telehealth programs or for transitioning in-person services to telehealth delivery during periods of social distancing and quarantine. IMPACT: As movement experts, physical therapists are uniquely positioned to play an important role in the current COVID-19 pandemic and to help individuals who are at risk of functional decline during periods of social distancing and quarantine. Lessons learned from this study's experience can provide guidance on the process and cost of developing and delivering a telehealth exercise program for older adults with functional impairments. The findings also can inform new telehealth programs, as well as assist in transitioning in-person care to a telehealth format in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Middleton, Addie; Simpson, Kit N; Bettger, Janet Prvu; Bowden, Mark G",Phys Ther,157,29

Acetylation of several proteins plays essential roles in various biological processes, such as viral infections. We reported that the nucleoproteins of influenza virus and Zaire Ebolavirus were acetylated, suggesting that these modifications contributed to the molecular events involved in viral replication. Similar to influenza virus and Ebolavirus, the coronavirus also contains single-stranded RNA, as its viral genome interacts with the nucleocapsid (N) proteins. In this study, we report that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins are strongly acetylated by human histone acetyltransferases, P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), and general control nonderepressible 5 (GCN5), but not by CREB-binding protein (CBP) in vitro. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses identified 2 and 12 acetyl-lysine residues from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, respectively. Particularly in the SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, the acetyl-lysine residues were localized in or close to several functional sites, such as the RNA interaction domains and the M-protein interacting site. These results suggest that acetylation of SARS-CoV-2 N proteins plays crucial roles in their functions.","Hatakeyama, Dai; Masuda, Takeshi; Miki, Ryosuke; Ohtsuki, Sumio; Kuzuhara, Takashi",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,157,23

While Hispanics are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, little is known about ethnic disparities in the hospital settings. This study investigates imaging utilization and clinical outcomes between Hispanic and non-Hispanic COVID-19 patients in the Emergency Department (ED) and during hospitalization. METHODS: Through retrospective chart review, we included 331 symptomatic COVID-19 patients (mean age 53.2 years) at a metropolitan healthcare system from March to June 2020. Poisson regression was used to compare diagnostic imaging utilization and clinical outcomes between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients. RESULTS: After adjusting for confounders, no statistically significant difference was found between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients for the number of weekly chest X-rays. Results were categorized into four clinical outcomes: ED management (0.16 ± 0.05 vs. 0.14 ± 0.8, p:0.79); requiring inpatient management (1.31 ± 0.11 vs. 1.46 ± 0.16, p:0.43); ICU admission without invasive ventilation (1.4 ± 0.17 vs. 1.35 ± 0.26, p:0.86); and ICU admission and ventilator support (3.29 ± 0.22 vs. 3.59 ± 0.37, p:0.38). There were no statistically significant relative differences in adjusted prevalence rate between ethnic groups for all clinical outcomes (p > 0.05).

OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the actionability and clinical utilization of molecular tumor profiling results obtained via Foundation Medicine tumor sequencing tests in uterine and ovarian cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a single-institution retrospective chart review to obtain demographic and clinical information in patients with uterine and ovarian cancer whose tumors were submitted to Foundation Medicine for molecular tumor profiling over a 7-year period. Alterations identified on testing were stratified according to the OncoKB database actionability algorithm. Descriptive statistics were primarily used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Tumors from 185 women with gynecologic cancer were submitted for molecular tumor profiling between 2013 and 2019. The majority of tests (144/185; 78%) were ordered after a diagnosis of recurrence. In 60 (32%), no actionable molecular alteration was identified. Thirteen (7%) identified an alteration that directed to a US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy in that tumor type, while 112 (61%) had alterations with investigational or hypothetical treatment implications. In patients with any actionable finding, treatment was initiated in 27 (15%) based on these results. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of uterine and ovarian cancers (93%) did not have molecular alterations with corresponding Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments. Even in patients with a potentially actionable alteration, gynecologic oncologists were more likely to choose an alternative therapy. Further investigation is warranted to determine which patients with uterine and ovarian cancer are most likely to benefit from molecular tumor profiling and the ideal timing of testing. The potential to identify effective therapeutic options in a minority of patients needs to be balanced with the current limited clinical applicability of these results in most cases.","Watson, Catherine H; Broadwater, Gloria; Wong, Janice; Spinosa, Daniel; de Oca, Mary Katherine Montes; Datto, Michael; Green, Michelle; Hubbard, Christopher; McKinney, Matthew; McCall, Shannon J; Havrilesky, Laura J; Strickler, John H; Berchuck, Andrew; Strickland, Kyle C; Previs, Rebecca A",Target Oncol,157,22

This study aimed to show the participant behaviour when webinars present at the COVID-19 pandemic era. METHODS: From December 2017 to July 2020, 58 webinars were broadcasted via the Uropedia, electronic library of SUST. Data of all webinars were collected with the YouTube analytics and application of the Uropedia. Data of streaming webinars included participant behaviours such as content views, engagement time, total unique attendees, average engagement time and the number of audience to leads. Data were split into two groups; group-1 is webinars before COVID-19 (before March 2020) and group-2 is the webinars during COVID-19. RESULTS: Total broadcast time and total page view number were found to be 112.6 hours (6761 minutes) and 15 919, respectively. The median participant age was 40.1 y. Median content view and median engagement time were found to be 261.0 and 12.2 minutes, respectively.

There are limited clinical or imaging data on muscle changes over time. METHODS: Two adult SMA patients underwent clinical assessments including measures of upper and lower limb function with Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) and Hammersmith Function Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE); both patients were also studied with whole-body muscle MRI (T1-weighted and Diffusion Tensor Imaging/DTI sequences), at baseline and after 10 and 24 months from the beginning of treatment with nusinersen. RESULTS: After two years of treatment, HFMSE and RULM scores were stable in both patients. DTI sequences revealed an increased number, length and organization of muscle fiber tracks, and Fractional Anisotropy (FA) values showed a significant reduction after 10 and 24 months from baseline, in their corresponding maps. DISCUSSION: Muscle DTI imaging seems to play an interesting role to monitor treatment effects over time in adult SMA patients.","Barp, Andrea; Carraro, Elena; Albamonte, Emilio; Salmin, Francesca; Lunetta, Christian; Comi, Giacomo Pietro; Messina, Carmelo; Albano, Domenico; Chianca, Vito; Sconfienza, Luca Maria; Mercuri, Eugenio Maria; Sansone, Valeria Ada",J Neurol Sci,157,3

Although there has been progress in identifying the molecular features of both viruses and hosts, the extent of the impact these and other factors have that contribute to interspecies transmission and their relationship with the emergence of diseases are poorly understood. The objective of this review was to analyze the factors related to the characteristics inherent to RNA viruses accountable for pandemics in the last 20 years which facilitate infection, promote interspecies jump, and assist in the generation of zoonotic infections with pandemic potential. The search resulted in 48 research articles that met the inclusion criteria. Changes adopted by RNA viruses are influenced by environmental and host-related factors, which define their ability to adapt. Population density, host distribution, migration patterns, and the loss of natural habitats, among others, have been associated as factors in the virus-host interaction. This review also included a critical analysis of the Latin American context, considering its diverse and unique social, cultural, and biodiversity characteristics. The scarcity of scientific information is striking, thus, a call to local institutions and governments to invest more resources and efforts to the study of these factors in the region is key.","Alvarez-Munoz, Santiago; Upegui-Porras, Nicolas; Gomez, Arlen P; Ramirez-Nieto, Gloria",Viruses,157,24

Immediately after an epidemic, governments and social organizations often provide psychological services for children and adolescents to relieve their distress. However, many adolescents report distress even long after a traumatic event because of the unaddressed traumatic atmosphere in schools or families. To advance this issue, this article proposes a cooperative model of psychological services provision for children and adolescents in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. This model suggests that psychological services should simultaneously include social, school, and family systems, which interact and have a synergistic effect. The social system provides direct services not only for children and adolescents but also for their school and family systems; school and family systems cooperate to support adolescents. Psychological work also needs to emphasize the key elements of school and family systems. Attention should be given to teachers' distress, teacher-student relationships, and peer relationships in the school system, as well as to parents' distress, parent-child relationships, and the marital relationship in the family system. In these ways, adolescents can achieve an efficient and sustainable recovery following a disaster. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).","Zhou, Xiao",Psychol Trauma,157,3

Concerns have been raised over whether currently authorized lateral flow tests are sufficiently sensitive and specific to detect enough infections to impact transmission whilst minimizing unnecessary isolation of false positives. These concerns have often been illustrated using simple, textbook calculations of positivity rates and positive predictive value assuming fixed values for sensitivity, specificity and prevalence. However, we argue that evaluating repeated testing strategies requires the consideration of three additional factors: new infections continue to arise depending on the incidence rate, isolating positive individuals reduces prevalence in the tested population, and each infected individual is tested multiple times during their infection course. We provide a simple mathematical model with an online interface to illustrate how these three factors impact test positivity rates and the number of isolating individuals over time. These results highlight the potential pitfalls of using inappropriate textbook-style calculations to evaluate statistics arising from repeated testing strategies during an epidemic.","Hay, James A; Hellewell, Joel; Qiu, Xueting",Eur. j. epidemiol,157,20

The skin damage is a result of the increased friction and pressure at the mask-skin barrier. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians have been applying various skin barriers to prevent and ameliorate skin breakdown. However, there are no studies to our knowledge that assess the safety and efficacy of using these skin barriers without compromising a sufficient mask-face seal. AIM: To conduct the largest study to date of various skin barriers and seal integrity with quantitative fit testing (QNFT). METHODS: This pilot study explored whether the placement of a silicone scar sheet (ScarAway®), Cavilon&#8482;, or Tegaderm&#8482; affects 3M&#8482; half-face mask respirator barrier integrity when compared to no barrier using QNFT. Data were collected from nine clinicians at an academic level 1 trauma centre in New Jersey. FINDINGS: The silicone scar sheet resulted in the lowest adequate fit, whereas Cavilon provided the highest fit factor when compared to other interventions (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings help inform clinicians considering barriers for comfort when wearing facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic and for future pandemics.","Trehan, R S; McDonnell, E P; McCoy, J V; Ohman-Strickland, P A; Donovan, C; Quinoa, T R; Morrison, D S",J. hosp. infect,157,5

Other important proteins involved in this process include disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17) also known as tumour necrosis factor-&#945;-converting enzyme and transmembrane serine protease 2. ACE2 converts angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin (1-7), to balance the renin angiotensin system. Membrane-bound ACE2 ectodomain shedding is mediated by ADAM17 upon viral spike binding, Ang II overproduction and in several diseases. The shed soluble ACE2 (sACE2) retains its catalytic activity, but its precise role in viral entry is still unclear. Therapeutic sACE2 is claimed to exert dual effects; reduction of excess Ang II and blocking viral entry by masking the spike protein. Nevertheless, the paradox is why SARS-CoV-2 comorbid patients struggle to attain such benefit in viral infection despite having a high amount of sACE2. In this review, we discuss the possible detrimental role of sACE2 and speculate on a series of events where protease primed or non-primed virus-sACE2 complex might enter the host cell. As extracellular virus can bind many sACE2 molecules, sACE2 level could be reduced drastically upon endocytosis by the host cell. A consequential rapid rise in Ang II level could potentially aggravate disease severity through Ang II-angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) axis in comorbid patients. Hence, monitoring sACE2 and Ang II level in coronavirus disease 2019 comorbid patients are crucial to ensure safe and efficient intervention using therapeutic sACE2 and vaccines.","Rahman, Mohammad Mahmudur; Hasan, Maruf; Ahmed, Asif",Rev. med. virol,157,3

High Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in COVID-19 patients suggest that a cytokine storm may play a major role in the pathophysiology and are considered as a relevant parameter in predicting most severe course of disease. The aim of this study was to assess repeated IL-6 levels in critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and to evaluate their relationship with patient's severity and outcome. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 10 (i.e. the date of the first admitted patients) and April 30, 2020. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected at admission. On the day of IL-6 blood concentration measurement, we also collected results of D-Dimers, C-Reactive Protein, white blood cells and lymphocytes count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin as well as microbiological samples, whenever present. RESULTS: Of a total of 65 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our ICU we included 41 patients with repeated measure of IL-6. There was a significant difference in IL-6 levels between survivors and non-survivors over time (p = 0.001); moreover, non survivors had a significantly higher IL-6 maximal value when compared to survivors (720 [349-2116] vs. 336 [195-646] pg/mL, p = 0.01). The IL-6 maximal value had a significant predictive value of ICU mortality (AUROC 0.73 [95% CI 0.57-0.89]; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Repeated measurements of IL-6 can help clinicians in identifying critically ill COVID-19 patients with the highest risk of poor prognosis.","Gorham, Julie; Moreau, Anthony; Corazza, Francis; Peluso, Lorenzo; Ponthieux, Fanny; Talamonti, Marta; Izzi, Antonio; Nagant, Carole; Ndieugnou Djangang, Narcisse; Garufi, Alessandra; Creteur, Jacques; Taccone, Fabio Silvio",PLoS One,157,16

This literature review provides an overview of recent studies of genetic polymorphisms in genes that mediate the SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism (ACE1, ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CD26). In addition, genetic variations in the drug-metabolising enzyme genes of several selected drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 are summarised. This may help construct an effective health protocol based on genetic biomarkers to optimise response to treatment. Potentially, pharmacogenomics could contribute to the development of effective high-throughput assays to improve patient evaluation, but their use will also create ethical, medical, regulatory, and legal issues, which should now be considered in the era of personalised medicine.","Al-Eitan, Laith N; Alahmad, Saif Z",Rev Med Virol,157,29

We also investigated the associations between mask wearing hesitancy and various factors. METHODS: We surveyed a sample (convenience sampling) of 5 groups of people: general population, people with epilepsy, people with diabetes mellitus (DM), people with cardiac problems, and people with psychiatric problems. The survey included 4 general questions (age, sex, education, and medical/psychiatric problem) and 4 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-specific questions (contracting COVID-19, relatives with COVID-19, wearing a face mask while in crowded places, and the frequency of daily hand washings). RESULTS: A total of 582 people (153 people with epilepsy, 127 patients with DM, 98 people with cardiac problems, 96 patients with psychiatric disorders, and 108 healthy individuals) participated. Twenty-eight (4.8%) people expressed that they do not wear a face mask when at crowded places. A lower education and less frequent daily hand washings had associations with mask wearing hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: Mask wearing hesitancy is a concern during a respiratory viral disease pandemic. Paying attention to personal variables, especially if they are modifiable (eg, education and hygiene), is probably productive and practical in promoting mask wearing culture.","Asadi-Pooya, Ali A; Nezafat, Abdullah; Sadeghian, Saeid; Shahisavandi, Mina; Nabavizadeh, Seyed Ali; Barzegar, Zohreh",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,157,26

Clinical research trials around the world are underway testing a wide array of possible medications. In particular, the off-label use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment has created many unprecedented challenges for the scientific community and the public. AREAS COVERED: We critically assessed major events from February - May 2020 that contributed to widespread use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19. We aimed to explore how opinions toward hydroxychloroquine may shift from early enthusiasm (based on in vitro and preliminary clinical data) to the hope for a miracle cure (through communication and promotion of questionable results) and, finally, to a rise of skepticism as more in-depth analyses are emerging. EXPERT OPINION: Mindful and rigorous acquisition of data, as well as its interpretation, are essential to an effective pandemic response. The rapid and premature promotion of results has had major implications for global crisis management, even creating distrust among the public. It is crucial for the medical and scientific community to incorporate the lessons learned from this situation.","Sattui, Sebastian E; Liew, Jean W; Graef, Elizabeth R; Coler-Reilly, Ariella; Berenbaum, Francis; Duarte-García, Alí; Harrison, Carly; Konig, Maximilian F; Korsten, Peter; Putman, Michael S; Robinson, Philip C; Sirotich, Emily; Ugarte-Gil, Manuel F; Webb, Kate; Young, Kristen J; Kim, Alfred H J; Sparks, Jeffrey A",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,157,24

In the face of severely complex international trends and domestic and international economic conditions, artificial intelligence plays an important auxiliary role in the regular prevention and management of COVID-19. In order to effectively correspond to the formalized extensional prevention and control theory, it is essential to use coordination models, rule systems, prevention and control mechanisms, and governance landscapes to build artificial intelligence corresponding systems. This article uses a basic genetic algorithm to realize the robot path plan. This mainly includes the establishment of environmental models, the discovery of chromosomes and the determination of coding methods, the selection and design of fitness functions, and related designs. This paper proposes a new adaptive adjustment mode based on the basic genetic algorithm, which improves the selection and mutation operation, and improves the optimization efficiency of the genetic algorithm. Building an artificial intelligence response system may face various technical risks and governance dilemmas. Only by improving the rule system of artificial intelligence, creating an epidemic prevention and control ecology, conserving the public spirit of the whole people, strengthening the governance of the source of crisis, and further improving the new momentum of economic and social development and public safety. The modernization of governance capabilities can better respond to the current complex situation.","Liu, Yaoyao; Zhang, Yixin; Liu, Xiaoya",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,157,1

This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 in RPs compared to the general population and to relatively assess the potential role of RPs' treatment regimen against COVID-19. In a cross-sectional study, all RPs with an updated medical record between December 1, 2019, and February 29, 2020, at the rheumatology clinic of Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Qom, Iran were included (as the case group), and the prevalence of COVID-19 was compared to the paired control group-individuals without RDs, randomly selected from the Qom Health Network's database. Qom was the first city in Iran in which COVID-19 was identified and spread rapidly. Both groups were paired regarding sex, age, and underlying severe conditions. The prevalence of COVID-19 was lower in RPs than the control group (p = 0.028). Moreover, patients who were under treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic agents seemed to possess a lower risk for COVID-19. Two RPs died from COVID-19, both of whom had granulomatosis and polyangiitis (GPA). The prevalence of COVID-19 in the RPs was lower than the control group, which could be associated with more adherence to the quarantine and social distancing rules by RPs and stricter routine follow-ups than the general population. Besides, taking DMARDs, such as leflunomide, might possess a protective effect against severe COVID-19, probably as a result of preventing cytokine storm.","Moradi, Soroush; Masoumi, Maryam; Mohammadi, Somayeh; Vafaeimanesh, Jamshid; Mohseni, Mohaddeseh; Mahdavi, Hossein; Aryannejad, Armin",Intern. emerg. med,157,24

Treatments are typically administered in a vis-a-vis setting with patients reporting symptoms of a previously experienced trauma. Conversely, online-therapies and ongoing trauma have not received adequate attention. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of two brief treatments for health professionals and individuals suffering from the circumstances imposed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The EMDR and the trauma focused-CBT were administered online during the earliest stage of distress to manage the ongoing trauma associated to quarantine or disease. Thirty-eight patients satisfying the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for acute stress disorder were randomly assigned to the EMDR or CBT treatment. Both groups received a 7-session therapy, and psychometric tests were administered before, after the treatment and at one-month follow-up to assess traumatic symptoms, depression and anxiety. Results revealed that both treatments reduced anxiety by 30%, and traumatic and depressive symptoms by 55%. Present findings indicate the internet-based EMDR and CBT as equally effective brief treatments, also suggesting a maintenance of the effects as indicated by the follow-up evaluation. The EMDR and CBT might be considered as first line therapies to treat the ongoing trauma and to prevent the sensitization and accumulation of trauma memories.","Perri, R.

The aim of this study is to identify endoscopic practice patterns and outcomes of IBD and coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) with a worldwide survey of HCP. Methods: The 20-item survey questionnaire was sent to physician members of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Special Interest Group in Interventional IBD, Chinese IBD Society Endoscopy Interest Group, and the China Crohn's and Colitis Foundation. Results: A total of 141 respondents submitted valid responses. Nighty-five respondents (67.9%) reported that at least 25% of their scheduled emergent endoscopic procedures were canceled or postponed during the pandemic. Fifty-six respondents (40.0%) have performed emergent endoscopy during the pandemic. A few respondents (9/140, 6.4%) estimated that more than 25% of their patients had worsened disease due to delayed or canceled emergent endoscopy procedures. More than 80% of respondents believed that personal protective equipment (PPE) for the endoscopy team, room sterilization, and pre-procedure screening of patients for COVID-19 were necessary. Out of 140 respondents, 16 (11.4%) reported that several of their patients had COVID-19. Eight clinicians (5.7%) reported that they or their endoscopy colleagues developed work-related COVID-19. Conclusions: Cancellation of elective and emergent endoscopy in IBD care during the pandemic was common. Few respondents reported that their patients' disease conditions worsened due to the cancellation of the endoscopy procedure. Most respondents voiced the need for proper PPE during the procedure regardless of patients' COVID-19 status and screening the patients for COVID-19.","Chen, Yan; Yu, Qiao; Farraye, Francis A; Kochhar, Gursimran S; Bernstein, Charles N; Navaneethan, Udayakumar; Wu, Kaicun; Zhong, Jie; Schwartz, David A; Wu, Hao; Zheng, Jing-Jing; Iacucci, Marietta; Kiran, Ravi P; Shen, Bo",,157,21

However, the actual impact of lockdowns on access to medicines and HTN control has not been reported. Between March 25 and June 30, 2020, the Government of Uganda instituted a nationwide lockdown. Health facilities remained open, however motor vehicle transportation was largely banned. In Ugandan public health facilities, HTN services are offered widely, however the availability of HTN medicines is generally low and inconsistent. In contrast, antiretrovirals for people with HIV (PWH) are free and consistently available at HIV clinics. We sought to evaluate the impact of the lockdown on access to medicines and clinical outcomes among a cohort of Ugandan patients with HTN and HIV.","Schwartz, Jeremy I; Muddu, Martin; Kimera, Isaac; Mbuliro, Mary; Ssennyonjo, Rebecca; Ssinabulya, Isaac; Semitala, Fred C",Glob Heart,157,24

There is currently no FDA approved antiviral strategy to alleviate the disease burden. The conserved 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), which controls coronavirus replication is a promising drug target for combating the coronavirus infection. This study screens some African plants derived alkaloids and terpenoids as potential inhibitors of coronavirus 3CLpro using in silico approach. Bioactive alkaloids (62) and terpenoids (100) of plants native to Africa were docked to the 3CLpro of the novel SARS-CoV-2. The top twenty alkaloids and terpenoids with high binding affinities to the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro were further docked to the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The docking scores were compared with 3CLpro-referenced inhibitors (Lopinavir and Ritonavir). The top docked compounds were further subjected to ADEM/Tox and Lipinski filtering analyses for drug-likeness prediction analysis. This ligand-protein interaction study revealed that more than half of the top twenty alkaloids and terpenoids interacted favourably with the coronaviruses 3CLpro, and had binding affinities that surpassed that of lopinavir and ritonavir. Also, a highly defined hit-list of seven compounds (10-Hydroxyusambarensine, Cryptoquindoline, 6-Oxoisoiguesterin, 22-Hydroxyhopan-3-one, Cryptospirolepine, Isoiguesterin and 20-Epibryonolic acid) were identified. Furthermore, four non-toxic, druggable plant derived alkaloids (10-Hydroxyusambarensine, and Cryptoquindoline) and terpenoids (6-Oxoisoiguesterin and 22-Hydroxyhopan-3-one), that bind to the receptor-binding site and catalytic dyad of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro were identified from the predictive ADME/tox and Lipinski filter analysis.

The disease poses a significant threat, decisions about prioritizing care should be made in accordance with the proven risk factors for complications. OBJECTIVE: The present study provides the first bespoke prediction model in the Middle East to identify COVID-19 patients, who are at higher risk for complications. METHOD: A case-control study design was adopted to compare the characteristics of successfully recovered patients with those who had complications. Complications were defined as admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, sepsis or septic shock, pneumonia or respiratory failure, and death. The prediction model was created through multivariable logistic regression. Overall statistical significance tests for the model were carried out. RESULTS: All COVID-19 infected hospitalized patients (n = 133) in Amman - Jordan were included in the study. Successfully recovered were 125 patients. The median age (IRQ) was 26 (10-40). Almost 30% were >40 years. Patients with complications were eight patients, age 63 (51.5-71.5). The prediction model identified the following variables as risk factors: diabetes (OR = 59.7; 95% CI: 3.5-1011.5, p = 0.005), fever (OR = 24.8; 95% CI: 1.4-447.3, p = 0.029), SHORTNESS OF BREATH (OR = 15.9; 95% CI: 1.3-189.7, p = 0.029), body mass index (OR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.61-0.88, p = 0.001), abnormal Neutrophils (OR = 16.8; 95% CI: 1.0-292.0, p = 0.053). Prediction model was statistically significant, &#967;2(5) = 86.1, p < 0.0005. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike reports from China, the most influential variables that led to disease progression in Jordanian patients were diabetes, fever, shortness of breath, body mass index, and abnormal neutrophils. Similar to reports from the USA, smoking was not a leading factor for complications. Comorbidities and patient health status, rather than age, were the primary risk factors for complications.

METHODS: This study is a quasi-experiment study. The study population was patients who visited all 402 EDs in Korea between December 31, 2019 and May 13, 2020, using the National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) database. The study period was classified into 5 phases according to the level of national crisis warning of infectious disease and the implementation of emergency care-related health policies, and all study phases were 27 days. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcome was length of stay (LOS) in the ED during the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: The number of ED visits during the study period was 2,636,341, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 1.4%. The number of ED visits decreased from 803,160 in phase 1 to 496,619 in phase 5 during the study period. For in-hospital mortality, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval) was 0.77 (0.74-0.79) in phase 5 compared to phase 3. Additionally, by subgroup, the ORs were 0.69 (0.57-0.83) for the patients with acute myocardial infarction and 0.76 (0.67-0.87) for severe trauma in phase 5 compared to phase 3. The ED LOS increased while the number of ED visits decreased as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, and the ED LOS declined after policy implementation (beta coefficient: -5.3 [-6.5 to -4.2] minutes in phase 5 compared to phase 3). CONCLUSION: Implementing appropriate emergency care policies in the COVID-19 pandemic would have contributed to improving the safety of all emergency patients and reducing in-hospital mortality by preventing excessive deaths.","Pak, Yun Suk; Ro, Young Sun; Kim, Se Hyung; Han, So Hyun; Ko, Sung Keun; Kim, Taehui; Kwak, Young Ho; Heo, Tag; Moon, Sungwoo",J Korean Med Sci,157,1

Here, we reported effects of COVID-19 outbreak on the mood of general public and ascertained impacts of psychosocial factors on the plague-related emotional measures. METHODS: During Feb. 4-6, 2020, a self-reported questionnaire Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was disseminated to general public via Wechat, along with a sociodemographic information sheet. BAI score and incidences of moderate and severe anxiety in subgroups of respondents were compared. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were done for correlation analysis and to identify factors predictive of anxiety. RESULTS: Averaged BAI score of all respondents is higher than those of general public in two previous studies. The people quarantined for probable COVID-19 infection presented higher BAI score and incidences of moderate and severe anxiety relative to non-quarantined respondents. People in high epidemic area showed higher BAI score and incidences of moderate and severe anxiety compared to those in low epidemic area. Significant associations existed between anxiety level of the respondents and each of the investigated factors, except for gender. Quarantine was the predictor with a highest OR, followed by divorced/widow. The other factors showed smaller but significant effects on the anxiety level of respondents. LIMITATIONS: This cross-sectional study was unable to track the emotional changes in the respondents over time. It had a relatively small sample and involved some of emotional measures only.

The advent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted not only in the closing of most outpatient clinics for face-to-face consultations but also in the inability to perform most laboratory and imaging investigations. This has resulted in a paradigm shift in the delivery of care for those with diabetic foot ulcers. The approaches to this challenge in two centers with an interest in diabetic foot disease, including virtual consultations using physician-to-patient and physician-to-home nurse telemedicine as well as home podiatry visits, are described in this review and are illustrated by several case vignettes. The outcomes from these two centers suggest that we may be witnessing new possibilities in models of care for the diabetic foot.","Shin, Laura; Bowling, Frank L; Armstrong, David G; Boulton, Andrew J M",Diabetes Care,157,0

The promotion of inflammation in asthma by IL-17A and IL-17F has been confirmed. In addition to covalent homodimers, both cytokines are also able to form heterodimers, further inducing downstream pathways via binding to the IL-17RA and IL-17RC receptor complex. In recent years, IL-17RA and its signal transduction pathway have been extensively researched. IL-17RC, however, remains relatively unexplored. In the present study, we self-assembled chitosan (CS) nanoparticles for intranasal delivery of recombinant protein IL-17RC (rIL-17RC) and preliminarily investigated its effect on a murine model of allergic asthma induced by ovalbumin (OVA). rIL-17RC was produced by the prokaryotic expression system and encapsulated into the CS nanoparticles via ionic cross-linking technique. The results showed that CS-RC nanoparticles via intranasal intervention significantly caused inhibition of mucus secretion and airway inflammatory cell infiltration, and reduced IL-4, IL-17, IL-17F levels in BALF. Hence, delivering receptor proteins such as IL-17RC, through CS nanoparticles as a carrier, could be an attractive therapeutic intervention for asthma.","Lv, Yongli; Zhang, Jianhua; Wang, Chaoying",Bioengineered,157,20

These assets are not independent but correlated during a short time period. A graph convolutional reinforcement learning framework called DeepPocket is proposed whose objective is to exploit the time-varying interrelations between financial instruments. These interrelations are represented by a graph whose nodes correspond to the financial instruments while the edges correspond to a pair-wise correlation function in between assets. DeepPocket consists of a restricted, stacked autoencoder for feature extraction, a convolutional network to collect underlying local information shared among financial instruments and an actor–critic reinforcement learning agent. The actor–critic structure contains two convolutional networks in which the actor learns and enforces an investment policy which is, in turn, evaluated by the critic in order to determine the best course of action by constantly reallocating the various portfolio assets to optimize the expected return on investment. The agent is initially trained offline with online stochastic batching on historical data. As new data become available, it is trained online with a passive concept drift approach to handle unexpected changes in their distributions.

Several studies provide an initial indication of the possible role of pre-existing immunity, whether cross-immunity or not. The possible role of latent tuberculosis (TB) and malaria has been suggested to create innate cross heterogeneous immunity. In this study, we looked for the influence of these factors on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality in malaria-endemic countries. STUDY DESIGN: Eighty malaria-endemic countries were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Data subjected to testing included TB prevalence, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine coverage, malaria incidence, and COVID-19 mortality. METHODS: Hierarchical multiple regression type of analysis was used for data analyses. TB prevalence per 100,000 population standardized to BCG coverage rates was taken as a direct factor in the test. Malaria incidence per 1000 population was considered an intermediate factor. The outcome was COVID-19 mortality per million population. RESULTS: The results showed with robust statistical support that standardized TB prevalence was significantly associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality. Malaria had an additional effect in reducing COVID-19 mortality, with a highly significant association.

An effective treatment aiming at reducing the inflammation without preventing virus clearance is thus urgently needed. Tocilizumab, an anti-soluble IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, has been proposed for treatment of patients with COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective cohort study at the Montichiari Hospital, Brescia, Italy, was conducted. We included consecutive patients with COVID-19 related pneumonia at the early stage of respiratory failure, all treated with a standard protocol (hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily, lopinavir 800 mg plus ritonavir 200 mg per day). We compared survival rate and clinical status in a cohort of patients who received additional treatment with tocilizumab once (either 400 mg intravenous or 324 mg subcutaneous) with a retrospective cohort of patients who did not receive tocilizumab (referred to as the standard treatment group). All outcomes were assessed at the end of the follow-up, that correspond to death or complete recovery and discharge from the hospital. Findings: 158 patients were included, 90 of which received tocilizumab. 34 out of 68 (50%) patients in the standard treatment group and 7 out of 90 (7.7%) in the tocilizumab group died. Tocilizumab significantly improved survival compared to standard care (multivariate HR: 0.057; 95% C.I = 0.017- 0.187, p < 0.001). No differences between the two administration routes of tocilizumab were observed. No tocilizumab-related infections and/or side effects were observed. Interpretation: Early treatment with tocilizumab could be helpful to prevent excessive hyper-inflammation and death in COVID-19 related pneumonia. Low dose administration of tocilizumab is not associated with adverse events.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the frequency and severity of OGD in SARS-CoV-2 (+) out-patients compared to controls with common cold/flu like symptoms and two negative RT-PCR. METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional study on SARS-CoV-2-positive out-patients (n = 197) and controls (n = 107) from five Spanish Hospitals. Severity of OGD was categorized by visual analogue scale (VAS). Frequency and severity of the chemosensory impairment were analyzed. RESULTS: The frequencies of smell (70.1%) and taste loss (65%) were significantly higher among COVID-19 subjects than in the controls (20.6% and 19.6%, respectively). Simultaneous OGD was more frequent in the COVID-19 group (61.9% vs 10.3%) and they scored higher in VAS for severity of OGD than controls. In the COVID-19 group, OGD was predominant in young subjects 46.5 ± 14.5 and females (63.5%). Subjects with severe loss of smell were younger (42.7 years old vs 45.5 years old), and recovered later (median = 7, IQR = 5.5 vs median = 4, IQR = 3) than those with mild loss of smell. Subjects with severe loss of taste, recovered later in days (median = 7, IQR = 6 vs median = 2, IQR = 2), compared to those with mild loss. CONCLUSION: OGD is a prevalent symptom in COVID-19 subjects with significant differences compared to controls. It was predominant in young and females subjects. Stratified analysis by the severity of OGD showed that more than 60% of COVID-19 subjects presented a severe OGD who took a longer time to recover compared to those with mild symptoms.","Rojas-Lechuga, María Jesús; Izquierdo-Domínguez, Adriana; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos; Calvo-Henríquez, Christian; Villarreal, Ithzel Maria; Cuesta-Chasco, Genoveva; Bernal-Sprekelsen, Manuel; Mullol, Joaquim; Alobid, Isam",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,157,21

Although several vaccine candidates have shown promising results in clinical trials, resulting in expedited approval for public use from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, recent polls suggest that Americans strongly distrust the vaccine and its approval process. This mistrust stems from both the unusual speed of vaccine development and reports about side effects. This article applies insights from behavioral economics to consider how the general public may make decisions around whether or not to receive a future COVID-19 vaccine in a context of frequent side effects and preexisting mistrust. Three common cognitive biases shown to influence human decision-making under a behavioral economics framework are considered: confirmation bias, negativity bias, and optimism bias. Applying a behavioral economics framework to COVID-19 vaccine decision-making can elucidate potential barriers to vaccine uptake and points of intervention for clinicians and public health professionals.","Saleska, Jessica Londeree; Choi, Kristen R",Transl Behav Med,157,6

Further, naturally-occurring polyanions (bacterial lipopolysaccharide, DNA/RNA) can interact with PF4 to recapitulate HIT antigens. Indeed, immunologic presensitization to naturally-occurring polyanions could explain why HIT more closely resembles a secondary, rather than a primary, immune response. In 2008 it was first reported that a HIT-mimicking disorder can occur without any preceding exposure to heparin or polyanionic medications. Termed ""spontaneous HIT syndrome"", two subtypes are recognized: (a) surgical (post-orthopedic, especially post-total knee arthroplasty, and (b) medical (usually post-infectious). Recently, COVID-19 adenoviral vector vaccination has been associated with a thrombotic thrombocytopenic disorder associated with positive PF4-dependent enzyme-immunoassays and serum-induced platelet activation that is maximal when PF4 is added. Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) features unusual thromboses (cerebral venous thrombosis, splanchnic vein thrombosis) similar to those seen in spontaneous HIT syndrome. The emerging concept is that classic HIT reflects platelet-activating anti-PF4/heparin antibodies whereas spontaneous HIT syndrome and other atypical ""autoimmune HIT"" presentations (delayed-onset HIT, persisting HIT, heparin ""flush"" HIT) reflect heparin-independent platelet-activating anti-PF4 antibodies-although the precise relationships between PF4 epitope targets and the clinical syndromes remain to be determined. Treatment of spontaneous HIT syndrome includes non-heparin anticoagulation (direct oral Xa inhibitors favored over direct thrombin inhibitors) and high-dose immunoglobulin.","Warkentin, Theodore E; Greinacher, Andreas",Thromb Res,157,24

Observations thus far from the reports of COVID-19 have indicated that certain risk groups for example, those with pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and tobacco use are prone to disease development and specifically development of severe disease and possible fatality. It is increasingly evident that many CV conditions occur frequently. These include myopericarditis, acute coronary syndromes, thrombosis, arrhythmias, hypertension and heart failure. Many professional organisations and societies related to cardiology have produced guidelines or recommendations on most of the above-mentioned aspects. Given these rapid developments, the aims of this review manuscript were to summarise and integrate recent publications with newly developed guidelines and with the first-hand experience of frontline physicians and to yield a pragmatic insight and approach to CV complications of COVID-19. We emphasise on a strategic tier-based approach for initial assessment and management of COVID-19, and then delve into focused areas within CV domains, and additionally highlighting the role of point-of-care ultrasound especially lung ultrasound, echocardiography and electrocardiography, in the management of these patients. We hope this paper will serve as a useful tool in the CV management of COVID-19 for clinicians practicing in both developing and developed countries.","Veldtman, Gruschen R; Pirisi, Mario; Storti, Enrico; Roomi, Asad; Fadl-Elmula, Fadl Elmula M; Vriz, Olga; Bokhari, Sabahat; Ammash, Naser; Salam, Yezan; Liu, Guang Zong; Spinelli, Stefano; Barbieri, Greta; Hashmi, Shahrukh",,157,24

This rare situation of coexisting retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst (AC) and Chiari malformation type 1 (CM-1) have been previously reported in few cases (10 patients) with syringomyelia and hydrocephalus described to be the most relevant issues. The aim of this paper is to describe 3 pediatric cases of this condition with a systematic review of the literature, underlining the importance of surgical management tailored to the pathogenic mechanism. RESULTS: A case of a 10 months-old baby with coexisting AC and CM-1 with tri-ventricular hydrocephalus treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy, a case of 1 a year-old baby with a huge retrocerebellar AC and CM-1 treated with a cysto-peritoneal shunt and a case of a 15 years old with retrocerebellar AC causing symptomatic CM-1 treated with C0-C2 decompression, AC fenestration and duraplasty have been described. A long-term follow-up have been reported. CONCLUSION: Surgical management of coexisting ACs and CM-1 should not aim at the complete resolution of the cyst or of tonsils herniation, especially when pediatric patients are treated. Rather, the purpose of neurosurgeon should be to understand the underlying pathogenic mechanism and, then, restoring both the CSF flow in the posterior fossa and the dynamic equilibrium between ventricles, cyst and subarachnoid space.","Di Perna, Giuseppe; Piatelli, Gianluca; Rossi, Andrea; Consales, Alessandro; Fiaschi, Pietro; Castaldo, Margherita; Pavanello, Marco",World neurosurgery (Online),157,26

While multilateral institutions are beginning to consider how to distribute them, former U.S. President Trump and others have suggested suing China for damages. This ""lawsuit approach"" draws on a deep-seated conception of international law: States have a sovereign ""right to be left alone"";the only limit to this right is a correlative duty to avoid harming others. Those harmed can, then, sue for damages. In this view, who should pay for the costs of the pandemic (and how much) is not a normative question about justice, but rather one about factual causes and actuarial calculations. In this Article, we explore this lawsuit approach-not for its legal viability, but for its conceptual implications. We exhaustively and critically assess the doctrinal discussion on China's international liability for the pandemic while also pointing at deep theoretical implications that this novel crisis has for international law more broadly. Specifically, we make three novel claims. The first is that the arguments made using the lawsuit approach (based on the International Health Regulations and the no-harm principle), when meticulously analyzed under existing international norms, run into unexpected obstacles. On top of the jurisdictional and evidentiary hurdles noted by many, we argue that the lawsuit approach faces difficulties stemming from the lack of deep normative agreement in international law on how to deal with unprecedented challenges such as COVID-19. Our second claim draws on the first. Given the need to fill these normative voids, the lawsuit approach leads back to the global conversation about the allocation of losses that it carefully tries to avoid. This normative dependence cannot be spared by analogy with domestic law. Domestic law builds upon thick cultural understandings that fill empty legal concepts (such as ""harm"" or ""causation""), making them readily operative. International law, however, lacks an equivalent thick culture to fill these voids and therefore requires complex reconstructions of what states owe to one another. Our third claim further extends the foregoing reasoning. The lawsuit approach relies on international law as a means to achieve corrective justice while denying its implications for distributive justice. We argue that this is conceptually impossible. Allocating responsibility for the pandemic implicates inherently distributive concepts: To decide, an adjudicator would need to rely on a pretorian rule detailing how much effort and expense countries should dedicate to avoiding harm to other countries. That rule is conceptually distributive, independent of its content. The misfortunes derived from the pandemic are not conceptually different from the mis- fortunes of poverty, financial breakdowns, or climate change. Those going down the road of the lawsuit approach might be unpleasantly surprised by where that road leads them.","Guidi, Sebastián Maisley Nahuel",New York University Law Review,157,21

Since SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, little is known about it and no effective drug is available for its treatment.

SARS-CoV has been found to downregulate ACE2 and SARS- CoV-2 infection has been found to be associated with increased level of Angiotensin II.

Exosomes are 30-120 nm extracellular vesicles that participate in several pathological conditions. Virus-infected cells release exosomes that are implicated in infection through transferring viral components such as viral-derived miRNAs and proteins. As well, exosomes contain receptors for viruses that make recipient cells susceptible to virus entry. Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection has become a worldwide urgent public health concern. There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment existing for COVID-19 virus infection. Hence, it is critical to find a safe and effective therapeutic tool to patients with severe COVID-19 virus infection. Extracellular vesicles may contribute to spread this virus as they transfer such receptors as CD9 and ACE2, which make recipient cells susceptible to virus docking. Upon entry, COVID-19 virus may be directed into the exosomal pathway, and its component is packaged into exosomes for secretion. Exosome-based strategies for the treatment of COVID-19 virus infection may include following items: inhibition of exosome biogenesis and uptake, exosome-therapy, exosome-based drug delivery system, and exosome-based vaccine. Mesenchymal stem cells can suppress nonproductive inflammation and improve/repair lung cells including endothelial and alveolar cells, which damaged by COVID-19 virus infection.

Although majority of COVID-19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms are also seen. COVID-19 has also disrupted gastrointestinal endoscopy services in numerous ways. There are also concerns regarding the impact of these changes on gastrointestinal cancer screening and management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the implications of COVID-19 for the practicing gastroenterologist. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 patients can have gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain and anorexia. Separate from the management of COVID-19 patients, there has been a reduction in endoscopy volume worldwide. This has also resulted in reduction/cessation of in-person clinic visits and an increasing use of telemedicine services. In addition, patients with certain chronic diseases like chronic liver disease or inflammatory bowel disease may have worse outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUMMARY: Gastroenterologists need to rapidly adapt to the challenges being faced and need to make both systems and practice-based changes to the endoscopy unit and outpatient clinic practices. Gastroenterologists should stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving literature regarding gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients as well as its impact on chronic gastrointestinal illnesses.","Bilal, Mohammad; Sawhney, Mandeep S; Feuerstein, Joseph D",Curr Opin Gastroenterol,157,26

The aim was to analyse the quality of evidence supporting recommendations on the management of sepsis. METHODS: The strength and quality of evidence (high, moderate, low-very low and best practice statements) of each recommendation were extracted. Randomised controlled trials were required to qualify as high-quality evidence. RESULTS: A total of 96 recommendations were formulated, and 87 were included. Among thirty-one (43%) strong recommendations, only 15.2% were supported by high-quality evidence. Overall, thirty-seven (42.5%) recommendations were based on low-quality evidence, followed by 28 (32.2%) based on moderate-quality, 15 (17.2%) were best practice statements and only seven (8.0%) were supported by high-quality evidence. Randomised controlled trials supported 21.4%, 9.5% and 8.6% recommendations on mechanical ventilation, resuscitation, and management/adjuvant therapy, respectively. In contrast, none high-quality evidence recommendation supported antimicrobial/source control (82.4% were low-very low evidence or best practice statements), and nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: In the SSC guidelines most recommendations were informed by indirect evidence and non-systematic observations.

Containment strategies rely firstly on rapid and sensitive laboratory diagnosis, with molecular detection of the viral genome in respiratory samples being the gold standard. The reliability of diagnostic protocols could be affected by SARS-CoV-2 genetic variability. In fact, mutations occurring during SARS-CoV-2 genomic evolution can involve the regions targeted by the diagnostic probes. Following a review of the literature and an in silico analysis of the most recently described virus variants (including the UK B 1.1.7 and the South Africa 501Y.V2 variants), we conclude that the described genetic variability should have minimal or no effect on the sensitivity of existing diagnostic protocols for SARS-CoV-2 genome detection. However, given the continuous emergence of new variants, the situation should be monitored in the future, and protocols including multiple targets should be preferred.","Arena, Fabio; Pollini, Simona; Rossolini, Gian Maria; Margaglione, Maurizio",Int. j. mol. sci.

Since the first person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in Italy on February 21st, 2020, the number of people infected with SARS-COV-2 increased rapidly, mainly in northern Italian regions, including Piedmont. A strict lockdown was imposed on March 21st until May 4th when a gradual relaxation of the restrictions started. In this context, computational models and computer simulations are one of the available research tools that epidemiologists can exploit to understand the spread of the diseases and to evaluate social measures to counteract, mitigate or delay the spread of the epidemic. METHODS: This study presents an extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed-Susceptible (SEIRS) model accounting for population age structure. The infectious population is divided into three sub-groups: (i) undetected infected individuals, (ii) quarantined infected individuals and (iii) hospitalized infected individuals. Moreover, the strength of the government restriction measures and the related population response to these are explicitly represented in the model. RESULTS: The proposed model allows us to investigate different scenarios of the COVID-19 spread in Piedmont and the implementation of different infection-control measures and testing approaches. The results show that the implemented control measures have proven effective in containing the epidemic, mitigating the potential dangerous impact of a large proportion of undetected cases. We also forecast the optimal combination of individual-level measures and community surveillance to contain the new wave of COVID-19 spread after the re-opening work and social activities. CONCLUSIONS: Our model is an effective tool useful to investigate different scenarios and to inform policy makers about the potential impact of different control strategies. This will be crucial in the upcoming months, when very critical decisions about easing control measures will need to be taken.","Pernice, Simone; Castagno, Paolo; Marcotulli, Linda; Maule, Milena Maria; Richiardi, Lorenzo; Moirano, Giovenale; Sereno, Matteo; Cordero, Francesca; Beccuti, Marco",BMC Infect Dis,157,15

Methods: To assess coverage of wildlife and other environmental aspects, we reviewed major health security reports (including World Organisation for Animal Health Performance of Veterinary Services reports, and World Health Organization Joint External Evaluations and follow-on National Action Plans for Health Security) published by 107 countries and territories. We extracted information on stated coverage gaps, wildlife surveillance systems and priority diseases. We also searched National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans published by 125 countries to assess whether disease surveillance or prevention activities were included. Findings: We noted that the occurrence frequency of keywords indicative of wildlife, environment, biodiversity and climate factors varied with type of report and between countries. We found that more than half (57.9%, 62/107) of the reporting countries did not provide any evidence of a functional wildlife health surveillance programme. Most countries (83.2%, 89/107) indicated specific gaps in operations, coordination, scope or capacity. Only eight of the 125 countries (6.4%) publishing a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan reported tangible activities related to wildlife health or zoonotic disease. Conclusion: Overall, despite their importance for pandemic prevention, wildlife and environmental considerations are neglected in health security priorities and plans. Strengthening wildlife health capacity and operations should be emphasized in One Health efforts to monitor and mitigate known and novel disease risks.","Machalaba, Catherine; Uhart, Marcela; Ryser-Degiorgis, Marie-Pierre; Karesh, William B",Bull World Health Organ,157,23

The present work demonstrates the influence of plant extract composition (antioxidant and total phenolic content) on the size and morphology of the produced AgNPs. The biosynthetic procedure was rapid and simple and was easily monitored via colour changes and ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. Subsequently, measurement of zeta potential (ZP), photon cross-correlation spectroscopy (PCCS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis were employed to characterise the as-synthesised nanoparticles. The XRD investigation confirmed the presence of Ag0 in the nanoparticles, and interactions between the bioactive compounds of the plants and the produced AgNPs were evident in the FTIR spectra. TEM indicated that the nanoparticles exhibited a bimodal size distribution, with the smaller particles being spherical and the larger having a truncated octahedron shape. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of the AgNPs was tested against five bacterial strains. All synthesised nanoparticles exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity at a precursor concentration of 5 mM compared to the control substance, gentamicin sulphate, with the best results observed for AgNPs prepared with B. nigra and L. angustifolia extracts.","Salayová, Aneta Bedlovičová Zdenka Daneu Nina Baláž Matej Zdenka Lukáčová Bujňáková Balážová Ľudmila Tkáčiková Ľudmila",Nanomaterials,157,24

SETTING: The study was performed in a Jianghan module hospital constructed at the Wuhan Convention and Exhibition Center in Wuhan, China. This is 1 of the first 3 module hospitals. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: One thousand eight hundred forty-eight patients were admitted to the Jianghan module hospital, and 1327 cases (71.81% of the total number) were cured and discharged. Pharmacists have successfully completed the tasks of purchase, storage, and free distribution of drugs worth ¥1.03 million (approximately $146,000), reviewed about 20,000 electronic orders, provided one-on-one online medication consultation for 484 patients, and held 5 lectures on rational drug use knowledge, which could help reduce irrational drug use and minimize the risk involved. PRACTICE INNOVATION: The new COVID-19 ""module"" pharmaceutical care model is equipped with new features such as pharmacy emergency command group, organizational structure for pharmacy administration, electronic control of drug prescription, and ""zero contact"" pharmaceutical care relying on the new media platform ""WeChat."" This platform provides relevant pharmaceutical care for patients, such as ensuring drug supply, setting up critical care drug trolleys, designing specific drug packaging bags, creating a module radio station to broadcast rational drug use information to the patients, and other aspects. EVALUATION: With the continuous improvement of the module hospital and the progress in in-depth knowledge about COVID-19, some aspects such as patient admission criteria and variety of drugs need to be adjusted depending on the actual situation. RESULTS: The pharmacists provided pharmaceutical care for 1848 patients with mild COVID-19 disease. They not only ensured the timely supply of the drugs but also reduced the incidence of drug-induced risks through medication review and guidance, thereby improving patient compliance and helping the patients rebuild their confidence in overcoming the disease. CONCLUSION: The new COVID-19 module pharmaceutical care model has played an important role in overcoming the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in China and thus can be implemented on a broader scale.","Hua, XiaoLi; Gu, Ming; Zeng, Fang; Hu, Huiping; Zhou, Tao; Zhang, Yu; Shi, Chen",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),157,1

The purpose of this study is to explain the reasons for not maintaining health guidelines to prevent COVID-19 in high-risk jobs in Iran. METHODS: The present study was conducted with a qualitative approach among people with high-risk jobs in Tehran during March and April of 2020. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 31 people with high-risk occupations selected by purposeful sampling and snowballing. The data were analyzed using the conventional qualitative content analysis method and MAXQDA-18 software. Guba and Lincoln's criteria were also used to evaluate the quality of the research results. RESULTS: 4 main categories and 13 sub-categories were obtained, including individual factors (personality traits, lack of self-efficacy, little knowledge of the disease and how to observe health norms related to it, misconceptions about health), structural factors (difficulty of access to health supplies, lack of supportive environment, weak laws and supervision, the poor performance of officials and national media), economic factors (economic costs of living, lack of government economic support), Socio-cultural factors (learning, cultural beliefs, social customs, and rituals). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 prevention requires intervention at different levels. At the individual level: increasing people's awareness and understanding about how to prevent COVID-19 and strengthening self-efficacy in observing health norms, at the social level: highlighting positive patterns of observing health issues and training people about the consequences of social interactions during the outbreak of the virus, and at the macro level: strengthening regulatory rules and increasing people's access to hygienic products and support for the vulnerable must be taken into account.","SoleimanvandiAzar, Neda; Irandoost, Seyed Fahim; Ahmadi, Sina; Xosravi, Tareq; Ranjbar, Hadi; Mansourian, Morteza; Yoosefi Lebni, Javad",BMC Public Health,157,16

Our aim was to provide an insight into the change in the use of a pediatric emergency department (ED) during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The medical records of the children seen in our pediatric ED during March and April 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Consequently, these were compared to the medical records of 2018 and 2019 from the same time period and from other control periods (January-February 2019 and 2020, and July-August 2018 and 2019). The total number of ED visits declined by 73% from 2019 to 2020 (3051 vs 818). Significant variations were observed in the distribution of children between triage categories: the proportion of patients who was given a green-code showed a 0.59-fold decrease in comparison to 2019 (95% CI 0.5-0.69), while a relative increase in the proportion of yellow codes was observed (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.2-1.78).Conclusion: Quarantine measures significantly impacted on the total number of patients and on the reasons for visiting them in our pediatric ED. This substantial decrease in pediatric care may either be due to lower rates of acute infections because of social distancing, or to parents' or caregivers' reticence to risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in a health-care setting. What is known: â¢ A recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus responsible for a severe acute respiratory syndrome is spreading globally. â¢ Restrictive measures may impact patterns of healthcare utilization, as observed in other previous outbreaks. What is new: â¢ This study shows significant variations in the distribution of children among triage categories during the COVID-19 pandemic. â¢ Discharge diagnosis was significantly different as well, in particular a relative increase in the proportion of children presenting with traumatic injuries and a decrease of viral infections were observed.","Liguoro, Ilaria; Pilotto, Chiara; Vergine, Michela; Pusiol, Anna; Vidal, Enrico; Cogo, Paola",Eur. j. pediatr,157,16

Humoral and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses are comparable between HIV-positive and negative subjects and persist 5-7 months following predominately mild COVID-19 disease. T cell responses against Spike, Membrane and Nucleocapsid are the most prominent, with SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells outnumbering CD8 T cells. We further show that the overall magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses relates to the size of the naive CD4 T cell pool and the CD4:CD8 ratio in PLWH, in whom disparate antibody and T cell responses are observed.

The findings of NHS Lanarkshire were similar, with 31% of adolescents presenting to A&E as a result of COVID-19.No adolescent included in this review had contracted COVID-19 at any point. Their mental health was therefore impacted by the indirect effects of COVID-19 rather than the direct effects of infection. For the 31% of CAMHS presentations to A&E which were due to COVID-19, most young people struggled with the lockdown/restrictions.The number of presentations to A&E increased every month between April and August 2020 except for July. This could be due to people's initial fear of coming to hospital and catching COVID-19. However, as infection and death rates decreased towards the summer, people may have regarded hospitals as safer. The general increase in referrals every month may also be a reflection of the worsening of young people's mental health the longer the pandemic extended.","Nagiub, Youstina Hegde Rekha",BJPsych Open,157,1

However, cleavage of the amplicons and primers by the cis- and trans-activity of Cas12a hinders the attempts to integrate the amplification and detection into a single reaction. Through phosphorothioate modification of primers, we realized onepot detection with high sensitivity using plasmids of SARS-CoV-2, HPV16 and HPV18. We also identified the activated Cas12a has a much higher affinity to C nucleotide-rich reporter than others. By applying such reporters, the reaction time required for a lateral-flow readout was significantly reduced. Furthermore, to improve the specificity of the strip-based assay, we created a novel reporter and, when combined with a customized gold-nanopaticle strip, the readout was greatly enhanced owing to the elimination of the nonspecific signal. This established system, termed Targeting DNA by Cas12a-based Eye Sight Testing in an Onepot Reaction (TESTOR), was validated using clinical cervical scrape samples for human papillomaviruses (HPVs) detection. Our system represents a general approach to integrating the nucleic acid amplification and detection into a single reaction in CRISPR-Cas systems, highlighting its potential as a rapid, portable and accurate detection platform of nucleic acids.","Gong, Jiaojiao Kan Lijuan Zhang Xiuming He Ying Pan Jiaqiang Zhao Liping Li Qianyun Liu Menghao Tian Jie Lin Sili Lu Zhouyu Xue Liang Wang Chaojun Tang Guanghui",Bioactive Materials,157,1

This study compared the psychiatric status and sleep quality of FHWs during and after the COVID-19 outbreak in China. FHWs who volunteered to work in Hubei province (the COVID-19 epicenter) were assessed at baseline during the COVID-19 outbreak and re-assessed when they returned to their place of origin (Liaoning province) after the COVID-19 outbreak. Participants' psychiatric status and sleep quality were measured with the Symptom CheckList-90 (SCL-90) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. A total of 494 FHWs was assessed at baseline and 462 at follow-up assessments. The prevalence of poor psychiatric status was 10.5% at baseline and increased to 14.9% at the follow-up assessment (P = 0.04). The corresponding figures of poor sleep quality at baseline and follow-up assessment were 16.4% and 27.9%, respectively (P < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis found that severe fatigue (p = 0.003, OR = 1.266, 95% CI = 1.081-1.483), poor sleep quality (p < 0.001, OR = 1.283, 95% CI = 1.171-1.405), and history of pre-existing psychiatric disorders (p < 0.001, OR = 5.085, 95% CI = 2.144-12.06) were independently associated with higher odds of poor psychiatric status among the FHWs. Poor psychiatric status and sleep quality were common among FHWs during the COVID-19 outbreak, and the prevalence increased following their volunteer experiences. This suggests a critical need for longer-term psychological support for this subpopulation.","Zhou, Yifang; Ding, Hailong; Zhang, Yifan; Zhang, Baoyan; Guo, Yingrui; Cheung, Teris; Hall, Brian J; Shi, Tieying; Xiang, Yu-Tao; Tang, Yanqing",Transl Psychiatry,157,1

Accurate and early detection of TB is very important, otherwise, it could be life-threatening. In this work, we have detected TB reliably from the chest X-ray images using image pre-processing, data augmentation, image segmentation, and deep-learning classification techniques. Several public databases were used to create a database of 700 TB infected and 3500 normal chest X-ray images for this study. Nine different deep CNNs (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, ChexNet, InceptionV3, Vgg19, DenseNet201, SqueezeNet, and MobileNet), which were used for transfer learning from their pre-trained initial weights and trained, validated and tested for classifying TB and non-TB normal cases. Three different experiments were carried out in this work: segmentation of X-ray images using two different U-net models, classification using X-ray images, and segmented lung images. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1-score, specificity in the detection of tuberculosis using X-ray images were 97.07 %, 97.34 %, 97.07 %, 97.14 % and 97.36 % respectively.

Little is known about the impact on the cardiovascular system, and the incidence and consequences of new onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) in infected patients remain unclear. The aim of this study was to analyze the cardiovascular outcomes of patients with new-onset AF and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS: This observational study analyzed a sample of 160 consecutive patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. A group with new-onset AF (n = 12) was compared with a control group (total: n = 148, sinus rhythm: n = 118, previous AF: n = 30). New-onset AF patients were significantly older and hypertensive, as well as presenting more frequently with a history of acute coronary syndrome and renal dysfunction. This group showed a higher incidence of thromboembolic events (41.7% vs. 4.1%; p < 0.001), bleeding (33.3% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.005), a combined endpoint of thrombosis and death (58.3 vs. 19.6%, p = 0.006) and longer hospital stays (16.4 vs. 8.6 days, p < 0.001), with no differences in all-cause mortality. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, adjusted by potential confounding factors, new-onset AF demonstrated a 14.26 odds ratio for thromboembolism (95% confidence interval 2.86-71.10, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: New-onset AF in COVID-19 patients presumably has a notable impact on prognosis. The appearance of new-onset AF is related to worse cardiovascular outcomes, considering it as an independent predictor of embolic events. Further studies are needed to identify patients with COVID-19 at high risk of developing ""de novo"" AF, provide early anticoagulation and minimize the embolic risk of both entities.","Pardo Sanz, Ana; Salido Tahoces, Luisa; Ortega Pérez, Rodrigo; González Ferrer, Eduardo; Sanchez Recalde, Ángel; Zamorano Gómez, José Luis",Cardiol j (Print),157,1

This study was designed to investigate the relationship between long-term exposure to air pollution and the case fatality rate (CFR) of patients with COVID-19. The data on air quality index (AQI), PM2.5, PM10, SO2 , NO2 , and O3 from 14 major cities in China in the past 5 years (2015-2020) were collected, and the CRF of COVID-19 patients in these cities was calculated. First, we investigated the correlation between CFR and long-term air quality indicators. Second, we examined the air pollutants affecting CFR and evaluated their predictive values. We found a positive correlation between the CFR and AQI (1, 3, and 5 years), PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years), and PM10 (1, 3, and 5 years). Further analysis indicated the more significant correlation for both AQI (3 and 5 years) and PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years) with CFR, and moderate predictive values for air pollution indicators such as AQI (1, 3, and 5 years) and PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years) for CFR. Our results indicate that long-term exposure to severe air pollution is associated with higher CFR of COVID-19 patients.

No effective vaccine or treatment to control the virus has been approved yet. Social distancing and precautionary protocols are still the only way to prevent person-to-person transmission. We hope to identify anti-COVID-19 activity of the existing drugs to overcome this pandemic as soon as possible. The present study used HEX and AutoDock Vina softwares to predict the affinity of about 100 medicinal structures toward the active site of 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3Clpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), separately. Afterwards, MOE software and the pharmacophore-derived query methodology were employed to determine the pharmacophore model of their inhibitors. Tegobuvir (19) and compound 45 showed the best binding affinity toward RdRp and 3Clpro of SARS-CoV-2 in silico, respectively. Tegobuvir -previously applied for hepatitis C virus- formed highly stable complex with uncommon binding pocket of RdRp (E total: -707.91 Kcal/mol) in silico. In addition to compound 45, tipranavir (28) and atazanavir (26) as FDA-approved HIV protease inhibitors were tightly interacted with the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease as well. Based on pharmacophore modelling, a good structural pattern for potent candidates against SARS-CoV-2 main enzymes is suggested.

Pathways of the viral entry into cells are interesting subjects for targeted therapy of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The present study aims to provide a systematic evaluation of the most recent in vitro and in vivo investigations targeting SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. A systematic search was carried out in major medical sources, including MEDLINE (through PubMed), Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE. Combinations of the following search terms were used: SARS-CoV-2, in vitro, in vivo, preclinical, targeted therapy, and cell entry. A modified version of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation assessment tools were applied for evaluating the risk of bias of in vitro and in vivo studies, respectively. A narrative synthesis was performed as a qualitative method for the data synthesis of each outcome measure. A total of 2,649 articles were identified through searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Biorxiv. Finally, 22 studies (one in vivo study and 21 in vitro studies) were included. The spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 was the main target of investigation in 19 studies. SARS-CoV-2 can enter into the host cells through endocytosis or independently. SARS-CoV-2 S protein utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or CD147 as its cell-surface receptor to attach host cells. It consists of S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit mediates viral attachment to the host cells, while the S2 subunit facilitates virus-host membrane fusion. The cleavage of the S1-S2 protein, which is required for the conformational changes of the S2 subunit and processing of viral fusion, is regulated by the host proteases, including cathepsin L (during endocytosis) and type II membrane serine protease (independently). Targeted therapy strategies against SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mechanisms fall into four main categories: strategies targeting virus receptors on the host, strategies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, strategies targeting virus fusion to host cells, and strategies targeting endosomal and non-endosomal dependent pathways of virus entry. Inhibition of the viral entry by targeting host or virus-related components remains the most potent strategy to prevent and treat COVID-19. Further high-quality investigations are needed to assess the efficacy of the proposed targets and develop specific antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.","Seyedpour, Simin; Khodaei, Behzad; Loghman, Amir H; Seyedpour, Nasrin; Kisomi, Misagh F; Balibegloo, Maryam; Nezamabadi, Sasan S; Gholami, Bahareh; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",J. cell. physiol,157,24

This study sought to establish efficacy of a mindfulness-based group intervention for adolescents with mixed mental health disorders. METHOD: One hundred and eight adolescents (ages 13-18) were recruited from community mental health clinics and randomised into two groups (control vs. treatment). All participants received treatment-as-usual (TAU) from clinic-based therapists independent of the study. Adolescents in the treatment condition received TAU plus a 5-week mindfulness-training programme (TAU+Mi); adolescents in the control group received only TAU. Assessments including parent/carer reports were conducted at baseline, postintervention and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: At postintervention, adolescents in the mindfulness condition experienced significant decrease in mental distress (measured with the DASS-21) compared to the control group (Cohen's d = 0.43), and these gains were enhanced at 3-month follow-up (Cohen's d = 0.78). Overall outcomes at 3 months showed significant improvement for adolescents in the mindfulness condition; in self-esteem, mindfulness, psychological inflexibility and mental health, but not resilience. Parents/carers also reported significant improvement in their adolescent's psychological functioning (using the CBCL). Mediation analyses concluded mindfulness mediated mental health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Increase in mindful awareness after training leads to improvement in mental health and this is consistent with mindfulness theory. The mindfulness group programme appears to be a promising adjunctive therapeutic approach for clinic-based adolescents with mental health problems.","Tan, Lucy; Martin, Graham",Child Adolesc Ment Health,157,25

Current guidelines recommended testing for LS in individuals with newly diagnosed CRC to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality in relatives. Economic evaluations in support of such approach, however, are not available in Italy. We developed a decision-analytic model to analyze the cost-effectiveness of LS screening from the perspective of the Italian National Health System. Three testing strategies: the sequencing of all MMR genes without prior tumor analysis (Strategy 1), a sequential IHC and MS-MLPA analysis (Strategy 2), and an age-targeted strategy with a revised Bethesda criteria assessment before IHC and methylation-specific MLPA for patients &#8805; than 70 years old (Strategy 3) were analyzed and compared to the ""no testing"" strategy. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) in relatives after colonoscopy, aspirin prophylaxis and an intensive gynecological surveillance were estimated through a Markov model. Assuming a CRC incidence rate of 0.09% and a share of patients affected by LS equal to 2.81%, the number of detected pathogenic variants among CRC cases ranges, in a given year, between 910 and 1167 depending on the testing strategy employed. The testing strategies investigated, provided one-time to the entire eligible population (CRC patients), were associated with an overall cost ranging between 1,753,059.93-10,388,000.00. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the Markov model ranged from 941.24 /QALY to 1,681.93 /QALY, thus supporting that ""universal testing"" versus ""no testing"" is cost-effective, but not necessarily in comparison with age-targeted strategies. This is the first economic evaluation on different testing strategies for LS in Italy. The results might support the introduction of cost-effective recommendations for LS screening in Italy.","Pastorino, Roberta; Basile, Michele; Tognetto, Alessia; Di Marco, Marco; Grossi, Adriano; Lucci-Cordisco, Emanuela; Scaldaferri, Franco; De Censi, Andrea; Federici, Antonio; Villari, Paolo; Genuardi, Maurizio; Ricciardi, Walter; Boccia, Stefania",PLoS One,157,16

The determinants for selecting antibody combinations and the mechanism that antibody cocktails prevent viral escape remain unclear. We compared the critical residues in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) used by multiple neutralizing antibodies and cocktails and identified a combination of two antibodies CoV2-06 and CoV2-14 for preventing viral escape. The two antibodies simultaneously bind to non-overlapping epitopes and independently compete for receptor binding. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly escapes from individual antibodies by generating resistant mutations in vitro, but it doesn't escape from the cocktail due to stronger mutational constraints on RBD-ACE2 interaction and RBD protein folding requirements. We also identified a conserved neutralizing epitope shared between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV for antibody CoV2-12. Treatments with CoV2-06 and CoV2-14 individually and in combination confer protection in mice.

WeCareAdvisor provides caregivers with disease information, daily tips, and a systematic approach for describing behaviors, investigating underlying causes, creating tailored strategies, and evaluating their effectiveness (DICE). The trial will enroll 326 caregivers nationwide, randomly assign them to immediately receive WeCareAdvisor (treatment), or a 3-month waitlist (control) and evaluate short (1- and 3-month) and long-term (6-month) outcomes for caregiver distress with and confidence managing BPSD, and BPSD occurrences. We will also evaluate utilization patterns with different prompting conditions: high-intensity (telephone and email reminders), low-intensity (email reminders), or no reminders to use WeCareAdvisor. COVID-19 necessitated design modifications resulting in greater inclusivity of caregivers from diverse races, ethnicities, and geographic areas. Key modifications include shifting from in-home, in-person interviewing to telephone; adjusting tool functionality from operating on a grant-funded iPad to caregivers' personal internet-capable devices; and expanding recruitment from one metropolitan area to nationwide.

Systematic investigation of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has been limited to urban environments and large academic centers. Limited data on the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is available for those who live in a rural community setting, leaving rural practitioners to extrapolate the epidemiology of COVID-19 to a nonhomogeneous population. Objective: To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a community setting. The secondary objective of this study was to describe the difference in infection rate and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in the same rural community. Methods: A prospective convenience sample of community members and healthcare workers from the Kingman, Arizona area were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using a lateral flow immunoassay with the VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.) from September 28, 2020 to October 09, 2020. Upon recruitment, participants were asked to complete a demographic survey assessing socioeconomic status, comorbidities, and COVID-19 symptoms in the preceding two months. Following enrollment, a retrospective chart review was completed to determine the percentage of patients who had undergone previous SARS-CoV-RT-PCR testing. Results: A total of 566 participants were included in the final analysis: 380 (67.1%) were women, 186 (32.9%) were men, a majority (458; 80.9%) self-identified as White, and 303 (53.5%) were employed as healthcare professionals. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be 8.0% (45 of 566) across the sample and 9.9% (30 of 303) in healthcare workers. No statistical difference in seroprevalence was found between men and women, healthcare workers and other participants, amongst racial groups, by socioeconomic status, by comorbid conditions, or by education level. Among the participants, 108 (19.1%) underwent previous RT-PCR testing. Of the 45 patients who were antibody positive, 27 (60%) had received a previous RT-PCR test, with 20 (44.4%) testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Participants with symptoms of anosmia/ageusia (p<0.001), chest congestion (p=0.047), fever (p=0.007), and shortness of breath (p=0.002) within the past two months were more likely to have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: Only 8% of 566 participants in this rural community setting were found to have antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. A large minority (18; 40%) of patients testing seropositive for SARs-CoV-2 had never received a prior test, suggesting that the actual rates of infection are higher than publicly available data suggest.

During the pandemic period of COVID-19, wearing a mask to take delivery is a common application scenario, which makes the study of masked face recognition algorithm greatly significant. A masked face recognition algorithm based on attention mechanism is proposed in this paper in order to improve the recognition rate of masked face images. First, the masked face image is separated by the local constrained dictionary learning method, and the face image part is separated. Then, the dilated convolution is used to reduce the resolution reduction in the subsampling process. Finally, according to the important feature information of the face image, the attention mechanism neural network is used to reduce the information loss in the subsampling process and improve the face recognition rate. In the experimental part, the RMFRD and SMFRD databases of Wuhan University were selected to compare the recognition rate. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a better recognition rate.

The results indicate that the third-octave band level centered at 63 Hz and attributable to shipping activity is reduced in the spring of 2020 by about 1.6 dB relative to the mean of the prior five years, owing to the reduced economic activity initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The results are subtle, as the noise reduction is less than the typical seasonal fluctuation associated with warming ocean surface temperatures in the summer that reduces mode excitation support at typical ship source depths, causing a repeated annual level change on the order of 4 dB at shipping frequencies. Seasonality of the noise contribution near 20 Hz from fin whales is also discussed. Corroboration of a COVID-19 effect on shipping noise is offered by an analysis of automatic identification system shipping data and shipping container activity for Puget Sound, over the same six-year period, which shows a reduction in the second quarter of 2020 by â¼19% and â¼17%, respectively, relative to the mean of the prior five years.","Dahl, Peter H; Dall039,; Osto, David R; Harrington, Michael J",J Acoust Soc Am,157,10

METHODS: One hundred and ten eyes from 89 patients who received PSTA for macular edema were prospectively enrolled. The extent of anterior migration of triamcinolone acetonide was recorded immediately after the injection. If TA particles were visible in the subtenon space (or subconjunctival space), it was recorded as ""anterior subtenon migration"" (or ""anterior subconjunctival migration""). The correlation between anterior migration of triamcinolone acetonide and severe IOP elevation, which was defined as an increase of 8 mm Hg or more in IOP, was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 159 PSTAs were given to 110 eyes. After PSTA, anterior subtenon migration occurred in 70.4% and anterior subconjunctival migration occurred in 12.0% of injection. Severe IOP elevation occurred in 7.1% of those without anterior migration, in 25.9% of those with anterior subtenon migration, and in 31.6% of those with anterior subconjunctival migration after PSTA (P = .052). Compared to those without anterior migration of triamcinolone acetonide, the hazard ratio for severe IOP elevation was 3.307 in those with anterior subtenon migration (P = .12) and 5.289 in those with anterior subconjunctival migration (P = .042). CONCLUSIONS: Anterior migration of triamcinolone acetonide after PSTA predisposes eyes to severe IOP elevation. Careful injection to restrict the triamcinolone particle within the subtenon space and behind the equator may lower the rate of IOP elevation after PSTA.","Yang, Yun-Hsiang; Hsu, Wei-Cherng; Hsieh, Yi-Ting",Curr Eye Res,157,20

The change in biophysical properties like the refractive index of blood plasma due to the production of antibodies during infection may be very helpful in estimating the level and intensity of infection and subsequent treatment based on blood plasma therapy. In this article, Fano resonance-based refractive index sensor using plasmonic nanomatryoshka is proposed for blood plasma sensing. The interaction between hybridized modes (bright and dark modes) in optimized nanomatryoshka leads to Fano resonance, which by virtue of steeper dispersion can confine the light more efficiently compared with Lorentzian resonance. We propose the excitation of Fano resonances in sub 100-nm size nanomatryoshka based on newly emerging plasmonic materials ZrN and HfN, and one of the most widely used conventional plasmonic material, Au. Fano resonance-based plasmonic sensors leads to sensitivity = 188.5 nm/RIU, 242.5 nm/RIU, and 244.9 nm/RIU for Au, ZrN, and HfN, respectively. The corresponding figure of merit (nm/RIU) is ~ 3.5 × 103, 3.1 × 103, and 2.8 × 103 for Au, ZrN, and HfN, respectively.

This study explored the associations between alcohol use frequency, quantity, motives, and context with: (i) quarantine due to COVID-19 exposure and (ii) a positive diagnosis for COVID-19. A sample of n = 409 college student drinkers completed an online survey about their health and behaviors during the Fall 2020 semester. Since the start of the semester, 36% of students quarantined and 13% of students received a COVID-19 diagnosis. More frequent alcohol use was associated with increased odds of both quarantine and COVID-19 diagnosis. More frequent drinking for social motives was associated with increased likelihood of quarantine, and more frequent drinking for conformity motives was associated with increased likelihood of COVID-19 diagnosis. Participants who often drank alone or with a small group of friends were about half as likely to have quarantined, while those who often drank with a large group of friends were almost twice as likely to have quarantined. Participants who often drank in a bar or nightclub had almost three times the odds of a COVID-19 diagnosis. Frequent alcohol use and drinking for social and conformity motives and in certain contexts are linked to increased likelihood of COVID-19 exposure and diagnosis.

So far FL research has mostly focused on improving the performance, how the algorithmic disparity will be impacted for the model learned from FL and the impact of algorithmic disparity on the utility inconsistency are largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose an FL framework to jointly consider performance consistency and algorithmic fairness across different local clients (data sources). We derive our framework from a constrained multi-objective optimization perspective, in which we learn a model satisfying fairness constraints on all clients with consistent performance. Specifically, we treat the algorithm prediction loss at each local client as an objective and maximize the worst-performing client with fairness constraints through optimizing a surrogate maximum function with all objectives involved. A gradient-based procedure is employed to achieve the Pareto optimality of this optimization problem. Theoretical analysis is provided to prove that our method can converge to a Pareto solution that achieves the min-max performance with fairness constraints on all clients. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority that our approach over baselines and its effectiveness in achieving both fairness and consistency across all local clients.","Cui, Sen; Pan, Weishen; Liang, Jian; Zhang, Changshui; Wang, Fei",,157,17

India remains one of the highest typhoid disease burden countries, although a highly efficacious typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV), prequalified by the World Health Organization in 2017, has been available since 2013. In 2018, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) introduced TCV into its immunization program, targeting children aged 9 months to 14 years in 11 of 22 areas (Phase 1 campaign). We describe the decision making, implementation, and delivery costing to inform TCV use in other settings. METHODS: We collected information on the decision making and campaign implementation in addition to administrative coverage from NMMC and partners. We then used a microcosting approach from the local government (NMMC) perspective, using a new Microsoft Excel-based tool to estimate the financial and economic vaccination campaign costs. RESULTS: The planning and implementation of the campaign were led by NMMC with support from multiple partners. A fixed-post campaign was conducted during weekends and public holidays in July-August 2018 which achieved an administrative vaccination coverage of 71% (ranging fromâ 46% in high-income to 92% in low-income areas). Not including vaccine and vaccination supplies, the average financial cost and economic cost per dose of TCV delivery were $0.45 and $1.42, respectively. CONCLUSION: The first public sector TCV campaign was successfully implemented by NMMC, with high administrative coverage in slums and low-income areas. Delivery cost estimates provide important inputs to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and affordability of TCV vaccination through public sector preventive campaigns.","Date, Kashmira; Shimpi, Rahul; Luby, Stephen; N, Ramaswami; Haldar, Pradeep; Katkar, Arun; Wannemuehler, Kathleen; Mogasale, Vittal; Pallas, Sarah; Song, Dayoung; Kunwar, Abhishek; Loharikar, Anagha; Yewale, Vijay; Ahmed, Danish; Horng, Lily; Wilhelm, Elisabeth; Bahl, Sunil; Harvey, Pauline; Dutta, Shanta; Bhatnagar, Pankaj",Clin Infect Dis,157,16

Methods A total of 13 patients with COVID-19 confirmed at PUMCH from January 20 to February 6,2020 were selected as the research subjects.Their epidemiological histories,clinical characteristics,laboratory tests,and chest CT findings were analyzed retrospectively.The location,distribution,density,and other accompanying signs of abnormal lung CT lesions were recorded,and the clinical types of these patients were assessed. Results The clinical type was ""common type"" in all these 13 patients aged(46.8±14.7)years(range:27-68 years).Ten patients had a travel history to Wuhan or direct contact with patients from Wuhan,2 cases had recent travel histories,and 1 case had a travel history to Beijing suburb.The white blood cell(WBC)count was normal or decreased in 92.3% of the patients and the lymphocyte count decreased in 15.4% of the patients.Twelve patients(92.3%)had a fever,among whom 11 patients were admitted due to fever and 2 patients(15.4%)had low fever.Eight patients(61.5%)had dry cough.The CT findings in these 13 patients were all abnormal.The lesions were mainly distributed along the bronchi and under the pleura.The lesions were relatively limited in 8 patients(affecting 1-3 lobes,predominantly in the right or left lower lobe),and diffuse multiple lesions of bilateral lungs were seen in 5 patients.The CT findings mainly included ground glass opacities(GGOs)(n=10,76.9%),focal consolidation within GGOs(n=7,53.8%),thickened vascular bundle passing through the lesions(n=10,76.9%),bronchial wall thickening(n=12,92.3%),air bronchogram(n=10,76.9%),vacuole signs in the lesions(n=7,53.8%),fine reticulation and interlobular septal thickening(n=3,23.1%),reversed halo-sign(n=2,15.4%),crazy-paving pattern(n=2,15.4%),and pleural effusion(n=2,15.4%).Conclusions Most of our patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at PUMCH had a travel history to Wuhan or direct contact with patients from Wuhan.The first symptoms of COVID-19 mainly include fever and dry cough,along with normal or reduced counts of WBC and lymphocytes.CT may reveal that the lesions distribute along the bronchi and under the pleura;they are typically localized GGOs in the early stage but can become multiple GGOs and infiltrative consolidation in both lungs in the advanced stage.Scattered vacuole signs may be visible inside the lesions in some patients.","Song, Lan; Song, Wei; Sui, Xin; DU, Tiekuan; Liu, Wu; Wang, Baiyu; Lu, Xiaoping; Xu, Yan; Yang, Qiwen; Cao, Wei; Jin, Zhengyu",Zhongguo Yi Xue Ke Xue Yuan Xue Bao,157,16

OBJECTIVES: to analyze the effectiveness of the measurement of specific antibodies to SARS-CoV2 (IgM and IgG) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and to analyze the rate of SARS-CoV2 seroprevalence in the population. METHODS: 11 relevant studies, published before June 5, 2020, were included in this meta-analysis. These studies were identified by searching the MEDLINE and Scopus databases. The final selected studies were analyzed using STATA version 14. Publication bias was examined using both Egger's test and Funnel plots. Moreover, the I² statistic has been used to evaluate and verify heterogeneity. RESULTS: The 11 relevant studies selected for the present meta-analysis cover a total of 996 infection cases. According to the results, the average rate of positive cases for IgM (AU/mL) was 2.10 (95% CI: 1.65-2.55; I2=92.2%), and the sensitivity in individuals with positive IgM test was 63% (95% CI: 47-79; I2=94.9%).

However, cancer cells often rapidly develop drug resistance towards PIs due to a compensatory mechanism mediated by nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 1 (NFE2L1) and aspartic protease DNA damage inducible 1 homolog 2 (DDI2). Following DDI2-mediated cleavage, NFE2L1 is able to induce transcription of virtually all proteasome subunit genes. Under normal condition, cleaved NFE2L1 is constantly degraded by proteasome, whereas in the presence of PIs, it accumulates and induces proteasome synthesis which in turn promotes the development of drug resistance towards PIs. Here, we report that Nelfinavir (NFV), an HIV protease inhibitor, can inhibit DDI2 activity directly. Inhibition of DDI2 by NFV effectively blocks NFE2L1 proteolysis and potentiates cytotoxicity of PIs in cancer cells. Recent clinical evidence indicated that NFV can effectively delay the refractory period of MM patients treated with PI-based therapy. Our finding hence provides a specific molecular mechanism for combinatorial therapy using NFV and PIs for treating MM and probably additional cancers.","Gu, Yuan; Wang, Xin; Wang, Yu; Wang, Yebin; Li, Jie; Yu, Fa-Xing",Cell Signal,157,26

Parental stress is a risk factor for harsh or punitive parenting, and this association may be exacerbated by the use of alcohol. OBJECTIVE: We examine whether parental stress is associated with use of punitive parenting, as well as whether this association is modified by drinking pattern. PARTICIPANTS & SETTING: We used advertisements and word-of-mouth to recruit 342 parents living in Central Ohio during the initial stay-at-home order for COVID-19. METHODS: We used geographic ecological momentary assessment (gEMA) to measure parental stress and punitive parenting during three time periods (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m.) over a period of fourteen days using an app downloaded to their cellular telephone. Participants also completed a longer baseline survey. We used nested multilevel ordinal regression models, where at-the-moment assessments (Level 1) were nested within individuals (Level 2) to analyze data. RESULTS: Higher levels of parental stress [OR = 1.149 (95 % CI = 1.123, 1.176)] and later time of day [OR = 1.255 (95 % CI = 1.146, 1.373)] were positively related to odds of punitive parenting. Drinking pattern was not significantly related to punitive parenting in models with demographic covariates. Parents who drank alcohol both monthly and weekly and had higher levels of stress had greater odds of punitive parenting than parents with high levels of stress who abstain from alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol may be an accelerant in the use of punitive parenting for parents experiencing stress. As alcohol use increases during COVID-19, children may be at higher risk for punitive parenting.","Wolf, Jennifer Price; Freisthler, Bridget; Chadwick, Caileigh",Child Abuse Negl,157,3

The receptor binding is the first step of viral infection. Predicting virus-receptor interactions will be helpful for the interaction mechanism of viruses and receptors, and further find some effective ways of preventing and treating viral infectious diseases so as to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by viruses. Some computation algorithms have been proposed for identifying potential virus-receptor interactions. However, a common problem in those methods is the presence of noise in the similarity network. A new computational model (Network Enhancement and the Regularized Least Squares [NERLS]) is proposed to predict virus-receptor interactions based on improving similarities by Network Enhancement (NE). NERLS integrates the virus sequence similarity, the receptor sequence similarity and known virus-receptor interactions. We compute the virus sequence similarity and known virus-receptor interactions to construct the virus similarity network. The receptor similarity network is constructed by the Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity and the receptor sequence similarity. To obtain the final virus similarity network and the final receptor similarity network, NE is, respectively, applied for reducing the noise of the virus similarity network and the receptor similarity network. Finally, NERLS employs the regularized least squares to predict interactions of viruses and receptors. The experiment results show that NERLS achieves the area under curve value of 0.893 and 0.921 in 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation, respectively, which is consistently superior to four related methods [which include Initial interaction scores method via the neighbors and the Laplacian regularized Least Square (IILLS), Bi-random walk on a heterogeneous network (BRWH), Laplacian regularized least squares classifier (LapRLS), and Collaborative matrix factorization (CMF)]. Furthermore, a case study also demonstrates that NERLS effectively predicts potential virus-receptor interactions.","Zhu, Lingzhi; Yan, Cheng; Duan, Guihua",J Comput Biol,157,21

Starting in Wuhan, the capital of China’s Hubei province, it has spread it spread throughout the world in less than four months and has caused thousands of deaths. The WHO has declared it to be a pandemic. Humanity is shocked, and many governments have imposed total isolation. It has had varying success due to community negligence. In many cities, institutions and health personnel have not successfully managed this catastrophe. Isolation is the only effective strategy to stop the logarithmic growth of COVID 19.

This widespread of IPA use could potentially, but not necessarily, be responsible for an increase in IPA poisoning cases (e.g., in alcoholics and/or for suicide attempt, even more in a lockdown situation). Forensic identification of IPA-related fatalities remains challenging as IPA post mortem detection can also result from antemortem or post mortem production, or post mortem contamination. In order to illustrate this issue, we report the case of a 33-year-old man found dead with a bottle of pure IPA liquid close to him. Toxicological positive results only consisted in IPA (464, 260, 465 and 991 mg/L) and acetone (1560, 2340, 3040 and 1360 mg/L) in blood, vitreous humour, urine and bile, respectively (determinations using headspace gas chromatography with flame ionization detection). These IPA absolute concentrations and IPA-to-acetone ratios appear inferior to those usually reported in the literature (higher than 1000 mg/L and 1.1, respectively) in IPA poisoning cases. In conclusion, this death can be cautiously regarded as an IPA ingestion-related fatality in the hypothesis of a survival time which have promoted IPA metabolism to acetone: this hypothesis is supported by the putative limited IPA-ingested dose. This report emphasizes the fact that post mortem IPA and acetone concentration interpretation involves to take account of (i) results in multiple biological specimens, (ii) complete case history, and (iii) a search of possible IPA presence at the scene of death.","Dumollard, Carine; Wiart, Jean-François; Hakim, Florian; Demarly, Christophe; Morbidelli, Philippe; Allorge, Delphine; Gaulier, Jean-Michel",Int J Legal Med,157,20

Radioactive fallout impacted downwind atolls and islands leading to the external and internal exposure of the local populations to ionizing radiation. By law, individuals who were exposed to radiation in the context of these tests can file compensation claims with the French government if they develop certain radiogenic cancers. A claimant who meets the basic eligibility criteria (place, time, and type of disease) automatically benefits from the presumption of a causal link between radiation exposure and the development of their illness, unless the exposure is deemed too low. Since 2017, an effective dose threshold of 1 mSv per year has been used in the claims adjudication process. Decisions as to whether claimants have met this 1 mSv threshold in a given year are often made on the basis of data from government dose reconstruction studies carried out in 2005 and 2006. Using new information available from recently declassified documents on the radiological impact of French atmospheric nuclear tests in Polynesia, as well as atmospheric transport modeling of radioactive fallout, this article shows that maximum doses to the public for key atmospheric tests may have been underestimated by factors of 2 to 10 and estimates that the total population exposed above the compensation threshold of 1 mSv/yr could be greater than ~110,000. This latter result corresponds to about 90% of the entire population of French Polynesia at the time of the atmospheric tests. Integrating these updated dose estimates into the claim adjudication process would enlarge the pool of eligible claimants by a factor of 10. Also discussed are the legal and policy implications of these findings.","Philippe, S'ebastien; Schoenberger, Sonya; Ahmed, Nabil",,157,32

The quality of its IT systems, together with access to the results of mass screening with Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, makes it possible to analyse the impact of various concurrent factors on the likelihood of contracting the disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Through data mining techniques with the sociodemographic and clinical variables recorded in patient's medical histories, a decision tree-based logistic regression model has been proposed which analyses the significance of demographic and clinical variables in the probability of having a positive PCR in a sample of 7,314 individuals treated in the Primary Care service of the public health system of Catalonia. The statistical approach to decision tree modelling allows 66.2% of diagnoses of infection by COVID-19 to be classified with a sensitivity of 64.3% and a specificity of 62.5%, with prior contact with a positive case being the primary predictor variable. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a classification tree model may be useful in screening for COVID-19 infection. Contact detection is the most reliable variable for detecting Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases. The model would support that, beyond a symptomatic diagnosis, the best way to detect cases would be to engage in contact tracing.","Marin-Gomez, Francesc X; Fàbregas-Escurriola, Mireia; Seguí, Francesc López; Pérez, Eduardo Hermosilla; Camps, Mència Benítez; Peña, Jacobo Mendioroz; Comellas, Anna Ruiz; Vidal-Alaball, Josep",PLoS One,157,22

Previous studies have focused on workers exposed to DMF in leather factories; however, little attention has been paid to the general population. This study was conducted to examine the effects of DMF exposure on elderly residents living near synthetic leather factories. A total of 962 subjects over 60 years of age in proximity to these factories (monitoring points) were enrolled as the exposure group, and 1924 permanent residents living distant from the factories were enrolled as the control group. The exposure group was divided into 3 groups according to their distance from the monitoring points. Physical examination, routine blood tests, and liver and renal function data were collected, and the DMF concentration in the air was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The prevalence of abnormal heart rhythm, electrocardiogram and B-mode ultrasound results in the exposure group was significantly greater than in the control group. Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in the exposure group also were higher than those in the control group (Pâ<â.01).

METHODS: First, best practices in translation and cross-cultural adaptation were applied through 6 steps. Then, the Spanish version was delivered to CR participants from programs in Colombia, Costa Rica and Peru for validation, such that the evaluation was pre-post, uncontrolled, pragmatic, observational, and prospective in design. Participants completed surveys assessing knowledge, health literacy, self-efficacy, and health behaviours. All outcomes were assessed pre-, and post-CR, as well as 6 months after CR completion. RESULTS: After translation of the patient guide from English to Spanish, 5 of the 9 booklets were culturally adapted. Two-hundred and forty-nine patients consented to participate, of which 184 (74 %) completed post-CR, and 121 (48 %) completed final assessments. There was a significant improvement in disease-related knowledge pre- to post-CR, as well as in health literacy, self-efficacy, and health behaviours (all p < 0.05). These gains were sustained 6 months post-program. With adjustment, CR attendance (i.e., exposure to the education) was associated with greater post-CR knowledge (ß = 0.026; p = 0.01).

This has presented unique challenges for educators in all fields as they have embarked, many for the first time, on the journey into remote education in order to provide distance learning opportunities for students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this article we will review our approach to rapidly converting an in-person diagnostic radiology elective to an entirely remote learning experience for medical students at our institution, including modification of course structure, software tools and materials utilized, and strategies for learner engagement and collaboration. RESULTS: Development of an online elective led to a 10-fold increase in student enrollment compared to the traditional course offering, providing a unique opportunity to reach a broad number of students, many of whom were in the early clinical stages of their medical school career. Lastly, we will review faculty feedback after participating in the remote course as well as lessons learned from the transition to distance learning and its implications for future work CONCLUSION: The current state of technology makes radiology particularly well-suited for distance learning, and with the proper tools and approaches, effective remote radiology instruction can be achieved.","Gomez, Erin; Azadi, Javad; Magid, Donna",Acad Radiol,157,1

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify any independent association between COVID-19 during pregnancy and preeclampsia and to determine the effect of these variables on maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. STUDY DESIGN: This was a large, longitudinal, prospective, unmatched diagnosed and not-diagnosed observational study assessing the effect of COVID-19 during pregnancy on mothers and neonates. Two consecutive not-diagnosed women were concomitantly enrolled immediately after each diagnosed woman was identified, at any stage during pregnancy or delivery, and at the same level of care to minimize bias. Women and neonates were followed until hospital discharge using the standardized INTERGROWTH-21st protocols and electronic data management system. A total of 43 institutions in 18 countries contributed to the study sample. The independent association between the 2 entities was quantified with the risk factors known to be associated with preeclampsia analyzed in each group. The outcomes were compared among women with COVID-19 alone, preeclampsia alone, both conditions, and those without either of the 2 conditions. RESULTS: We enrolled 2184 pregnant women; of these, 725 (33.2%) were enrolled in the COVID-19 diagnosed and 1459 (66.8%) in the COVID-19 not-diagnosed groups. Of these women, 123 had preeclampsia of which 59 of 725 (8.1%) were in the COVID-19 diagnosed group and 64 of 1459 (4.4%) were in the not-diagnosed group (risk ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-2.61). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and conditions associated with both COVID-19 and preeclampsia, the risk ratio for preeclampsia remained significant among all women (risk ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.52) and nulliparous women specifically (risk ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-3.05). There was a trend but no statistical significance among parous women (risk ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-2.73). The risk ratio for preterm birth for all women diagnosed with COVID-19 and preeclampsia was 4.05 (95% confidence interval, 2.99-5.49) and 6.26 (95% confidence interval, 4.35-9.00) for nulliparous women. Compared with women with neither condition diagnosed, the composite adverse perinatal outcome showed a stepwise increase in the risk ratio for COVID-19 without preeclampsia, preeclampsia without COVID-19, and COVID-19 with preeclampsia (risk ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.63-2.86; risk ratio, 2.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-4.45; and risk ratio, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.67-4.82, respectively). Similar findings were found for the composite adverse maternal outcome with risk ratios of 1.76 (95% confidence interval, 1.32-2.35), 2.07 (95% confidence interval, 1.20-3.57), and 2.77 (95% confidence interval, 1.66-4.63). The association between COVID-19 and gestational hypertension and the direction of the effects on preterm birth and adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes, were similar to preeclampsia, but confined to nulliparous women with lower risk ratios. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 during pregnancy is strongly associated with preeclampsia, especially among nulliparous women. This association is independent of any risk factors and preexisting conditions. COVID-19 severity does not seem to be a factor in this association. Both conditions are associated independently of and in an additive fashion with preterm birth, severe perinatal morbidity and mortality, and adverse maternal outcomes. Women with preeclampsia should be considered a particularly vulnerable group with regard to the risks posed by COVID-19.","Papageorghiou, Aris T; Deruelle, Philippe; Gunier, Robert B; Rauch, Stephen; García-May, Perla K; Mhatre, Mohak; Usman, Mustapha Ado; Abd-Elsalam, Sherief; Etuk, Saturday; Simmons, Lavone E; Napolitano, Raffaele; Deantoni, Sonia; Liu, Becky; Prefumo, Federico; Savasi, Valeria; do Vale, Marynéa Silva; Baafi, Eric; Zainab, Ghulam; Nieto, Ricardo; Maiz, Nerea; Aminu, Muhammad Baffah; Cardona-Perez, Jorge Arturo; Craik, Rachel; Winsey, Adele; Tavchioska, Gabriela; Bako, Babagana; Oros, Daniel; Rego, Albertina; Benski, Anne Caroline; Hassan-Hanga, Fatimah; Savorani, Mónica; Giuliani, Francesca; Sentilhes, Loïc; Risso, Milagros; Takahashi, Ken; Vecchiarelli, Carmen; Ikenoue, Satoru; Thiruvengadam, Ramachandran; Soto Conti, Constanza P; Ferrazzi, Enrico; Cetin, Irene; Nachinab, Vincent Bizor; Ernawati, Ernawati; Duro, Eduardo A; Kholin, Alexey; Firlit, Michelle L; Easter, Sarah Rae; Sichitiu, Joanna; Bowale, Abimbola; Casale, Roberto",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,157,24

The study was performed in a research laboratory in a medical ICU of a University hospital. An ICU (V500) and a lower-level ventilator (Elisée 350) were attached to two test-lungs (QuickLung) through a dedicated flow-splitter. A 50 mL/cmH2O Compliance (C) and 5 cmH2O/L/s Resistance (R) were set in both A and B test-lungs (A C50R5 / B C50R5, step1), A C50-R20 / B C20-R20 (step 2), A C20-R20 / B C10-R20 (step 3), and A C50-R20 / B C20-R5 (step 4). Each ventilator was set in volume and pressure control mode to deliver 800mL VT. We assessed VT from a pneumotachograph placed immediately before each lung, pendelluft air, and expiratory resistance (circuit and valve). Values are median (1st-3rd quartiles) and compared between ventilators by non-parametric tests. Between Elisée 350 and V500 in volume control VT in A/B test- lungs were 381/387 vs. 412/433 mL in step 1, 501/270 vs. 492/370 mL in step 2, 509/237 vs. 496/332 mL in step 3, and 496/281 vs. 480/329 mL in step 4. In pressure control the corresponding values were 373/336 vs. 430/414 mL, 416/185 vs. 322/234 mL, 193/108 vs. 176/ 92 mL and 422/201 vs. 481/329mL, respectively (P<0.001 between ventilators at each step for each volume). Pendelluft air volume ranged between 0.7 to 37.8 ml and negatively correlated with expiratory resistance in steps 2 and 3. The lower-level ventilator performed closely to the ICU ventilator. In the clinical setting, these findings suggest that, due to dependence of VT to C, pressure control should be preferred to maintain adequate VT at least in one patient when C and/or R changes abruptly and monitoring of VT should be done carefully.

The present work was aimed at studying the efficiency of thymulin and PRDX6 in a type 1 diabetes mellitus model induced by streptozotocin in mice. Effects of prolonged treatment with PRDX6 or thymic peptide thymulin on diabetes development were evaluated. We assessed the effects of the drugs on the physiological status of diabetic mice by measuring blood glucose, body weight, and cell counts in several organs, as well as effects of thymulin and PRDX6 on the immune status of diabetic mice measuring concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in blood plasma (TNF-&#945;, interleukin-5 and 17, and interferon-Î³), activity of NF-&#954;B and JNK pathways, and Hsp90&#945; expression in immune cells. Both thymulin and PRDX6 reduced the physiological impairments in diabetic mice at various levels. Thymulin and PRDX6 provide beneficial effects in the model of diabetes via very different mechanisms. Taken together, the results of our study indicated that the thymic peptide and the antioxidant enzyme have anti-inflammatory functions. As increasing evidences show diabetes mellitus as a distinct comorbidity leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 having cytokine storm, thymulin, and PRDX6 might serve as a supporting anti-inflammatory treatment in the therapy of COVID 19 in diabetic patients.","Novoselova, Elena G; Glushkova, Olga V; Lunin, Sergey M; Khrenov, Maxim O; Parfenyuk, Svetlana B; Novoselova, Tatyana V; Sharapov, Mars G; Gordeeva, Alina E; Novoselov, Vladimir I; Fesenko, Evgeny E",Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,157,16

Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects the lungs, and the gastrointestinal tract to some extent. Rapid structural mutations have increased the virulence and infectivity of the virus drastically. One such mutated strain known as the UK variant has caused many deaths in the United Kingdom. HYPOTHESIS: Among several indigenous natural ingredients used for prevention and cure of many diseases, the catechins have been reported for their antiviral activity, even against SARS-CoV-2. Characteristic mutations present on the spike protein have presented the newer strain its enhanced infectivity. The spike protein helps the virus bind to ACE2 receptor of the host cell and hence is a drug target. Catechins have been reported for their entry-inhibitory activity against several viruses. METHOD: In this study, we performed molecular docking of different catechins with the wild and mutant variants of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The stability of the best docked complexes was validated using molecular dynamics simulation. RESULTS: The in-silico studies show that the catechins form favourable interactions with the spike protein and can potentially impair its function. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) showed the best binding among the catechins against both the strains. Both the protein-ligand complexes were stable throughout the simulation time frame. CONCLUSION: The outcomes should encourage further exploration of the antiviral activity of EGCG against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.","Mhatre, Susmit; Gurav, Nitisha; Shah, Mansi; Patravale, Vandana",Comput Biol Med,157,0

The study investigated the relationships between lymphocyte subsets, cytokines, and disease outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The measurements of peripheral blood lymphocytes subsets and cytokine levels were performed by flow cytometry for 57 COVID-19 patients. Patients were categorized into two groups according to the severity of the disease (nonsevere vs. severe). Total lymphocytes, T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells were decreased in COVID-19 patients and statistical differences were found among different severity of illness and survival states (P Ë 0.01). The levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly higher in severe and death groups and negatively correlated with lymphocyte subsets counts. The percentages of Th17 in the peripheral blood of patients were higher than those of healthy controls whereas the percentages of Th2 were lower. For the severe cases, the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of IL-6 was the largest among all the immune parameters (0.964; 95% confidence interval: 0.927-1.000, P < 0.0001). In addition, the preoperative IL-6 concentration of 77.38 pg/ml was the optimal cutoff value (sensitivity: 84.6%, specificity: 100%). Using multivariate logistic regression analysis and ROC curves, IL-6 > 106.44 pg/ml and CD8+ T cell counts <150 cells/µl were found to be associated with mortality. Measuring the immune parameters and defining a risk threshold can segregate patients who develop a severe disease from those with a mild pathology. The identification of these parameters may help clinicians to predict the outcome of the patients with high risk of unfavorable progress of the disease.","Belaid, Brahim; Lamara Mahammad, Lydia; Mihi, Belgacem; Rahali, Sarah Yasmine; Djidjeli, Asma; Larab, Zineb; Berkani, Lilya; Berkane, Ismahane; Sayah, Wafa; Merah, Fatma; Lazli, Nouzha Zhor; Kheddouci, Lylia; Kadi, Ahmed; Ouali, Mourad; Khellafi, Rachida; Mekideche, Dalila; Kheliouen, Assia; Ayoub, Soraya; Hamidi, Réda Malek; Derrar, Fawzi; Gharnaout, Merzak; Allam, Ines; Djidjik, Réda",J. leukoc. biol,157,22

In Lebanon only one study about the out-patient use of PPI was done in community pharmacies, but in-patient prescription studies are inexistent. Our study will evaluate the use of PPIs in a hospital setting in Lebanon and will compare it to international recommendations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study, conducted in a university hospital in Lebanon (CHU NDS) between June and November 2018, included 186 randomly selected Lebanese inpatient adults. RESULTS: Less than half of the participants (46.8%) received a PPI for the adequate indication and 83.9% received the adequate PPI molecule, whereas only 9.2% received the adequate dose. The rate of PPI misuse was higher in the surgery ward (59.6%) than in the medicine department (40.4%) (Cardiology, internal medicine, neurology, pneumology, nephrology, infectious diseases, gastro-enterology, rheumatology). Concerning age, 56.3% of the &#8805; 65 years old patients were taking PPI for the right indication. However, among those who are < 65 years old, only 43.7% of the prescriptions were recommended. Also adequate PPI indication and adequate choice of drug was mainly noticed in patients having GI history or taking antiplatelet therapy. CONCLUSION: Our study has shown that a significant amount of PPIs was prescribed inadequately leading to a need to re-evaluate or adjust the use of PPIs among Lebanese physicians.","Souaid, Christophe Karl; Maalouf, Rami George; Hallit, Souheil; Akiki, Bassem; Dagher, Elissar",,157,27

These major epidemic patterns co-varied strongly with continental-scale seasonal temperature change patterns. Geo-contiguous states shared similar timing and amplitude of epidemic wave patterns irrespective of similarities or differences in state government political party affiliations. These analyses provide evidence that seasonal factors, probably weather changes, have exerted major effects on local COVID-19 incidence rates.

METHODS: Evaluation of cause, clinical symptoms, and treatment response. RESULTS: A 59-year-old woman with a background of transfusion-dependent aplastic anemia presented with seizures and reduced level of consciousness 10 days after the onset of subjective fever, cough, and headache. Nasopharyngeal swab testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was positive, and CT during admission demonstrated diffuse swelling of the brain stem. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation for airway protection, given her reduced level of consciousness. The patient's condition deteriorated, and MRI on day 6 demonstrated worsening brain stem swelling with symmetrical hemorrhagic lesions in the brain stem, amygdalae, putamina, and thalamic nuclei. Appearances were consistent with hemorrhagic ANE with early brain stem involvement. The patient showed no response to steroid therapy and died on the eighth day of admission. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 may be associated with an acute severe encephalopathy and, in this case, was considered most likely to represent an immune-mediated phenomenon.

In the laboratory, most IBV strains are restricted to replication in ex vivo organ cultures or in ovo and do not replicate in cell culture, making the study of their basic virology difficult. Entry of IBV into cells is facilitated by the large glycoprotein on the surface of the virion, the spike (S) protein, comprised of S1 and S2 subunits. Previous research showed that the S2' cleavage site is responsible for the extended tropism of the IBV Beaudette strain. This study aims to investigate whether protease treatment can extend the tropism of other IBV strains. Here we demonstrate that the addition of exogenous trypsin during IBV propagation in cell culture results in significantly increased viral titres. Using a panel of IBV strains, exhibiting varied tropisms, the effects of spike cleavage on entry and replication were assessed by serial passage cell culture in the presence of trypsin. Replication could be maintained over serial passages, indicating that the addition of exogenous protease is sufficient to overcome the barrier to infection. Mutations were identified in both S1 and S2 subunits following serial passage in cell culture. This work provides a proof of concept that exogenous proteases can remove the barrier to IBV replication in otherwise non-permissive cells, providing a platform for further study of elusive field strains and enabling sustainable vaccine production in vitro.","Stevenson-Leggett, Phoebe; Keep, Sarah; Bickerton, Erica",Viruses,157,16

These variations in the virus and genetic variation in human populations can determine virus transmissibility and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. Genetic variations and immune differences in human populations could be the driving forces in viral evolution. Recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants show several mutations at the receptor binding domain in the spike (S) glycoprotein and contribute to immune escape and enhanced binding with angiotensin 1-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Since ACE2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) play important roles in SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell, genetic variation in these host entry-related proteins may be a driving force for positive selection in the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein. Dendritic or liver/lymph cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-3-grabbing non-integrin is also known to play vital roles in several pathogens. Genetic variations of these host proteins may affect the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes the latest research to describe the impacts of genetic variation in the viral S glycoprotein and critical host proteins and aims to provide better insights for understanding transmission and pathogenesis and more broadly for developing vaccine/antiviral drugs and precision medicine strategies, especially for high risk populations with genetic risk variants.","Huang, Szu-Wei; Wang, Sheng-Fan",Int. j. mol. sci.

In particular, we assume that an epidemic spreads stochastically on a scale-free network and that each infected individual in the network gains a temporary immunity after its infectious period is over. After the temporary immunity period is over, the individual becomes susceptible to the virus again. When the underlying contact network is embedded in Euclidean geometry, we model three different intervention strategies that aim to control the spread of the epidemic: social distancing, restrictions on travel, and restrictions on maximal number of social contacts per node. Our first finding is that on a finite network, a long enough average immunity period leads to extinction of the pandemic after the first peak, analogous to the concept of “herd immunity”. For each model, there is a critical average immunity duration L cabove which this happens. Our second finding is that all three interventions manage to flatten the first peak (the travel restrictions most efficiently), as well as decrease the critical immunity duration L c, but elongate the epidemic. However, when the average immunity duration L is shorter than L c, the price for the flattened first peak is often a high second peak: for limiting the maximal number of contacts, the second peak can be as high as 1/3 of the first peak, and twice as high as it would be without intervention. Thirdly, interventions introduce oscillations into the system and the time to reach equilibrium is, for almost all scenarios, much longer. We conclude that network-based epidemic models can show a variety of behaviors that are not captured by the continuous compartmental models.","Jorritsma, Joost; Hulshof, Tim; Komjáthy, Júlia",Chaos Solitons Fractals,157,16

Clinical Case: A 61-years-old healthy man was admitted in the hospital emergency with hypertension, facial flushing, headache, nausea, vomiting and tremors. The patient presented hypertensive encephalopathy requiring orotracheal intubation. During the procedure, after rocuronium administration, the arterial pressure levels suddenly incresead more. An abdomen CT performed for vomiting investigation showed a mass in the left upper quadrant measuring 12.3 x 8.1 x 11.4 cm, central cystic area and sparse coarse calcifications, solid component density of 30 UH in the non-contrast phase and absolut washout of 48%, suggesting phaeochromocytoma (FEO) etiology. The patient renal function impaired and hemodialysis was required as replacement therapy. Even with small amount of urine available for exams, 24h urine tests were compatible with FEO diagnosis: (normetanephrines above 4260 mcg/L, n&amp;lt;732 mcg/L, 250 mL of urine). Considering the severity of symptoms, a chest CT scan was provided, not demonstrating any metastatic disease. Parenteral antihypertensive medication to manage blood pressure was required and this withdraw was reached after the introduction of prazosin 2 mg twice a day. After adequate preoperative preparation, the surgical removal was performed. Systolic BP intraoperative fluctuations occurred, with variations between 70 and 210mmHg. Splenectomy was necessary due the intimate contact with the adrenal mass. No obvious metastases were observed. The anatomopathological showed a 390 grams adrenal mass confirming FEO (PASS score 5). Genetic panel for phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma with complete sequencing found no pathogenic variants in any of the 22 genes analyzed, suggesting sporadic etiology. The patient got infected with COVID-19 after a family visitor confirmed by molecular test. He developed mild respiratory symptoms, delaying his hospital discharge. He was released seven weeks after surgery with complete kidney recover function using low doses of prazosin. Plasma metanephrines and normetanephrines were normal. Conclusion: Phaeochromocytoma is a rare disease with no specific clinical signs and symptoms. It implies in potentially lethal cardiovascular complications, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand it is a curable illness through the surgical tumor removal. Attention should be paid to high blood pressure levels even after the tumor is removed which can be justified by the remaining vascular hypertrophy as long as the suspicion of malignant FEO is excluded.","Dultra Bastos, Gabriel Fernando Falcão Camila Kruchewsky Lins Rolim Maria Creusa de Albuquerque",Journal of the Endocrine Society,157,17

The concept foresees traditional blackboard lectures with a reduced number of students present in the lecture hall, while the same lectures are simultaneously made available to the remaining students via high quality low-bandwidth online streaming. Based on our first assumption that traditional blackboard lectures, including the gestures and the facial expressions of the professor, are still a very efficient and highly appreciated means of teaching mathematics, this paper deliberately does not want to propose a novel pedagogical concept of how to teach mathematics, but rather presents a technical concept how to preserve the quality of traditional blackboard lectures even during the pandemic and how to make them available to the students at home via online streaming with adequate audio and video quality at low internet bandwidth. The second assumption is that the teaching of mathematics is a dynamic creative process that requires the physical presence of students in the lecture hall as audience so that the professor can instantaneously fine-tune the evolution of the lecture according to his/her perception of the level of attention and the facial expressions of the students. The third assumption of this paper is that students need to have the possibility to interact with each other personally. We report on the necessary hardware, software and logistics, and on the perception of the proposed blended lectures by students from civil and environmental engineering at the University of Trento, compared to traditional lectures and also compared to the pure online lectures that were needed as emergency measure at the beginning of the pandemic.","Busto, Saray; Dumbser, Michael; Gaburro, Elena",,157,0

Various common oral diseases, such as periodontitis and oral cancer, are closely associated with immune disorders in the oral mucosa. Regulatory T cells (Treg) are essential for maintaining self-tolerance and immunosuppression. During the process of periodontitis and apical periodontitis, two typical chronic immune-inflammatory diseases, Treg contributes to maintain host immune homeostasis and minimize tissue damage. In contrast, in the development of oral precancerous lesions and oral cancer, Treg is expected to be depleted or down-regulated to enhance the anti-tumor immune response. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the distribution, function, and regulatory mechanisms of Treg cells may provide a prospect for the immunotherapy of oral diseases. In this review, we summarize the distribution and multiple roles of Treg in different oral diseases and discuss the possible mechanisms involved in Treg cell regulation, hope to provide a reference for future Treg-targeted immunotherapy in the treatment of oral diseases.","Zhang, Yujing; Guo, Jihua; Jia, Rong",Front Immunol,157,32

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiology studies from a large academic health system were retrospectively studied from the first 33 weeks of 2020. Volume and work relative value unit (wRVU) data were aggregated on a weekly basis for three periods: Presurge (weeks 1-9), surge (10-19), and recovery (20-33), and analyzed compared to the pre-COVID baseline stratified by modality, specialty, patient service location, and facility type. Mean and median wRVU per study were used as a surrogate for case complexity. RESULTS: During the pandemic surge, case volumes fell 57%, while wRVUs fell by 69% relative to the pre-COVID-19 baseline. Mean wRVU per study was 1.13 in the presurge period, 1.03 during the surge, and 1.19 in the recovery. Categories with the greatest mean complexity declines were radiography (-14.7%), cardiothoracic imaging (-16.2%), and community hospitals overall (-15.9%). Breast imaging (+6.5%), interventional (+5.5%), and outpatient (+12.1%) complexity increased. During the recovery, significant increases in complexity were seen in cardiothoracic (0.46 to 0.49), abdominal (1.80 to 1.91), and neuroradiology (2.46 to 2.56) at stand-alone outpatient centers with similar changes at community hospitals. At academic hospitals, only breast imaging complexity remained elevated (1.32 from 1.17) during the recovery. CONCLUSION: Reliance on volume alone underestimates the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as there was a disproportionate loss in high-RVU studies. However, increased complexity of outpatient cases has stabilized overall losses during the recovery.","Carlon, Timothy; Finkelstein, Mark; Maron, Samuel Z; Goldman, Daryl; Kihira, Shingo; Marinelli, Brett; Dayan, Etan; Sullivan, Nisha; Hart, John; Doshi, Amish H; Delman, Bradley N; Lookstein, Robert; Drayer, Burton P",Acad. radiol,157,16

This rapid and vast production of proinflammatory cytokines contributes to a condition termed cytokine storm. A 35-year-old, otherwise healthy, employed, male patient was tested positive for COVID-19. He was admitted to the hospital on disease day 10 due to retarded verbal reactions and progressive delirium. On account of these conditions and the need for noninvasive/invasive ventilation, a combination treatment with baricitinib and remdesivir in conjunction with standard of care was initiated. The cytokine storm was rapidly blocked, leading to a vast pulmonary recovery with retarded recovery of the central nervous system. We conclude that the rapid blockade of the COVID-19-induced cytokine storm should be considered of avail as a principle of careful decision-making for effective recovery.","Muschitz, Christian; Trummert, Anita; Berent, Theresa; Laimer, Norbert; Knoblich, Lukas; Bodlaj, Gerd; Krainer, Alexander; Linder, Christoph; Resch, Heinrich",Wien. klin.

Due to barriers such as limited access to care, half of the women with PPD do not receive treatment. Therefore, it is critical to identify effective and scalable interventions. Traditional mindfulness programs have been effective in reducing depressive symptoms, however access remains a barrier. A self-paced mobile health (mHealth) mindfulness program may fit the lifestyle of busy mothers who are unable to attend in-person classes. However, little is known regarding the feasibility or efficacy of mHealth mindfulness interventions in postpartum women with depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an mHealth mindfulness intervention for postpartum women with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a single-arm feasibility trial of an mHealth mindfulness intervention within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated health care system. Participants were identified through clinician referral and electronic health records via KPNC's universal perinatal depression screening program and recruited by the study team. Inclusion criteria included the following: English-speaking, up to 6 months postpartum with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) score of 10 to 19, and no regular mindfulness/meditation practice. Participants were asked to use a mindfulness app, Headspace, 10 to 20 min/day for 6 weeks. Baseline and postintervention surveys captured data on patient-reported outcomes (depression and stress symptoms, sleep quality, and mindfulness). Semistructured interviews captured acceptability. Retention and adherence were used to assess feasibility. RESULTS: Of the 115 women who were contacted and met the eligibility criteria or declined participation before eligibility assessment, 27 (23%) were enrolled. In addition, 70% (19/27) completed the study. The mean age of participants was 31 years (SD 5.2), 30% (8/27) were non-Hispanic White, and, on average, participants were 12.3 weeks postpartum (SD 5.7). Of the women who completed the study, 100% (19/19) used the Headspace app at least once, and nearly half (9/19, 47%) used the app on &#8805;50% of the days during the 6-week intervention period. Of the 16 participants who completed the postintervention interview, 69% (11/16) reported that they were very or extremely satisfied with the app. Interviews indicated that women appreciated the variety of meditations and felt that the program led to reduced anxiety and improved sleep. Significant improvements in pre- and postintervention scores were observed for depressive symptoms (PHQ-8: -3.8, P=.004), perceived stress (10-item Perceived Stress Scale: -6.0, P=.005), and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: -2.1, P=.02, indicating less sleep disturbance). Improvements in mindfulness were also significant (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form: 10.9, P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: An mHealth mindfulness intervention for postpartum women with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms is feasible and acceptable. An efficacy trial is warranted.","Avalos, Lyndsay A; Aghaee, Sara; Kurtovich, Elaine; Quesenberry, Charles; Nkemere, Linda; McGinnis, MegAnn K; Kubo, Ai",JMIR Ment Health,157,14

There is an urgent need for robust and practical in vitro model systems to investigate viral pathogenesis. Here, we generated human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived lung organoids (LORGs), cerebral organoids (CORGs), neural progenitor cells (NPCs), neurons, and astrocytes. LORGs containing epithelial cells, alveolar types 1 and 2, highly express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces interferons, cytokines, and chemokines and activates critical inflammasome pathway genes. Spike protein inhibitor, EK1 peptide, and TMPRSS2 inhibitors (camostat/nafamostat) block viral entry in LORGs. Conversely, CORGs, NPCs, astrocytes, and neurons express low levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and correspondingly are not highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infection in neuronal cells activates TLR3/7, OAS2, complement system, and apoptotic genes. These findings will aid in understanding COVID-19 pathogenesis and facilitate drug discovery.","Tiwari, Shashi Kant; Wang, Shaobo; Smith, Davey; Carlin, Aaron F; Rana, Tariq M",Stem Cell Reports,157,1

It included items regarding ethical awareness and standard precaution self-efficacy at the individual level as well as safety environment, organizational culture for infection control, and degree of compliance with standard precautions at the organizational level. Individual and organizational predictors were identified using a multilevel analysis. The results indicated that 81.1% of nurses' compliance with standard precautions was influenced by individual differences, while only 18.9% was influenced by organizational differences. Individual- and organizational-level predictors explained 46.7% and 55.4% of the variance in emergency department nurses' compliance with standard precautions, respectively. Emergency department nurses' compliance with standard precautions was predicted by ethical awareness and standard precaution self-efficacy at the individual level and by organizational culture for infection control at the organizational level.

Current screening guidelines recommend frequent eye examinations. There is a dearth of trained ophthalmologists for these frequent screening procedures. The ANZNN neonatal network report (2013) found that only 6.4% of all screened infants had severe ROP and less than half received treatment. WINROP (online prediction model, Sweden) uses the postnatal weight gain (surrogate marker for low insulin-like growth factor IGF-1 and poor retinal vascular growth) to identify ROP requiring treatment and aims to reduce the number of examinations. Our objective was to validate the WINROP model in an Australian cohort of preterm infants. METHODS: Birth weight, gestational age, and weekly weight measurements were retrieved retrospectively along with the final ROP outcomes and plotted on the online WINROP software. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of WINROP were 85.7%, 59.0%, 6.98%, and 99.1% respectively for a cohort of 221 preterm infants (Median birth weight, 1040 g; Gestational age, 27.9 weeks). WINROP alarm was signaled in 42.6% of all infants. WINROP did not signal an alarm in one infant who needed treatment. This infant had intra ventricular hemorrhage grade 3-4 and temporary ventricular dilatation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first Australian study validating WINROP model. Our findings suggest that it lacked sensitivity to be used alone. However, adjusting the algorithm for the Australian population may improve the efficacy and reduce the number of examinations when used along with the current screening guidelines.","Desai, Saumil; Athikarisamy, Sam E; Lundgren, Pia; Simmer, Karen; Lam, Geoffrey C",,157,10

The patient was assessed for lung transplant as a salvage therapy for treatment-refractory ARDS following no signs of clinical improvement for > 7 weeks, despite best treatment. The patient was transported from Mexico to Korea by air ambulance under venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. She was successfully bridged to lung transplant on day 88, 49 days after the initiation of ECMO support. ECMO was successfully weaned at the end of operation, and no bleeding or primary graft dysfunction was observed within the first 72 hours. The patient was liberated from mechanical ventilation on postoperative day 9 and transferred to the general ward 5 days later. Despite the high doses of immunosuppressants, there was no evidence of viral reactivation after transplant. At 3 months post-transplantation, she was discharged to home without complication. Our experience suggests that successful lung transplant for COVID-19-associated ARDS is feasible even in a patient with prolonged pre-transplant ECMO support. Lung transplant may be considered a salvage therapy for COVID-19-associated ARDS that does not respond to conventional treatments.","Oh, Dong Kyu; Hong, Sang Bum; Kim, Ho Cheol; Kim, Dong Kwan; Choi, Sehoon; Lee, Geun Dong; Jung, Sung Ho; Kang, Pil Je; Kim, Won; Park, Seung Il",J Korean Med Sci,157,9

OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical features and severe illness risk factors of the patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), in order to provide support for the progression prediction, clinical treatment and prognosis of NCP patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 196 NCP patients treated in our hospital from January 25, 2020 to June 21, 2020 were divided into the severe group and the mild group. The clinical features of the two groups were analyzed and compared. The risk factors were explored by using multivariate logistic regression, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was obtained. The correlations of the risk factors with the prognosis of NCP were investigated combined with the lung function test. RESULTS: The primary clinical symptoms of 196 cases of NCP included fever in 167 cases (85.2%) and cough in 121 cases (61.73%). The chest computed tomography (CT) scans of the 178 cases (90.81%) showed a typical ground-glass opacification. In 149 cases, the lymphocyte count was decreased, while the levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), c-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and D-dimer (D-D) increased. 44 cases (22.45%) were found to be severely ill.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was needed to treat H7N9 induced ARDS at the time. MSCs transplant into patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were conducted in a single center and open-label clinical trial. Based on the principle of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were included as a control group while 17 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were served as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual blood-derived MSC. Notably, MSC transplantation significantly lower the mortality compared with in control group (17.6% died in MSC group vs 54.5% died in control group). Furthermore, MSC transplantation did not result in harmful effects in human body within the 5 year follow up period with 4 patients. Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve survival rate of H7N9 induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9 induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies. Because H7N9 and the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share similar complications (such as ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction, MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19.","Chen, Jiajia; Hu, Chenxia; Chen, Lijun; Tang, Lingling; Zhu, Yixin; Xu, Xiaowei; Chen, Lu; Gao, Hainv; Lu, Xiaoqing; Yu, Liang; Dai, Xiahong; Xiang, Charlie; Li, Lanjuan",,157,29

Consequently, globally maternal-newborn dyad care and outcomes are highly variable, leading to approximately 800 maternal deaths daily with a 100-fold difference among high- and low-resource countries. Irrespective of where care is received, maternal safety and wellbeing should be preserved. Despite ongoing efforts, however, this is not the case. Large gaps exist between spending and clinical outcomes. Segmented health care, coupled with poor planning and inadequate resource distribution, results in failure to provide essential life-saving treatment. The proposed solution is a regional integrated care model from midwife to advanced level III/IV care and the newborn unit, achieved through effective coordination by site, staff, and clinicians. This model has been successfully implemented in high- to low-resource countries in the past 20 years. In the large diverse population of the United States, constructive steps have been implemented to reduce high maternal mortality in black and rural communities. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the feasibility of rapid resources coordination to provide effective advanced care.

In COPD, adherence is generally suboptimal and is impaired by treatment complexity. Objective: To estimate the clinical and economic impact of an improvement in treatment adherence due to an increased use of once-daily single-inhaler triple therapy (SITT) in patients with COPD. Patients and Methods: A 7-state Markov model with monthly cycles was developed. Patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD, for whom triple therapy is indicated, were included. Outcomes and costs were estimated and compared for two scenarios: current distribution of adherent patients treated with multiple inhaler triple therapies (MITT) vs a potential scenario where patients shifted to once-daily SITT. In the potential scenario, adherence improvement due to once-daily SITT attributes was estimated. Costing was based on the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective (2019). A 3-year time horizon was defined considering a 3% discount rate for both costs and outcomes. Results: A target population of 185,111 patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD currently treated with MITT was estimated. A 20% increase in the use of once-daily SITT in the potential scenario raised adherence up to 52%. This resulted in 6835 exacerbations and 532 deaths avoided, with 775 LYs and 594 QALYs gained. Total savings reached 7,082,105. Exacerbation reduction accounted for 61.8% (4,378,201) of savings. Conclusion: Increasing the use of once-daily SITT in patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD treated with triple therapy would be associated with an improvement in adherence, a reduction of exacerbations and deaths, and cost savings for the Spanish NHS.","Miravitlles, Marc; Marín, Alicia; Huerta, Alicia; Carcedo, David; Villacampa, Alba; Puig-Junoy, Jaume",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,157,1

Approaches to design promising drug molecules have gone through many stages, from experiment-based trail-and-error approaches, to the well-established avenue of the quantitative structure-activity relationship, and currently to the stage guided by machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence techniques. In this work, we present a study of the permeability of small drug-like molecules across lipid membranes by two types of ML models, namely the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and deep neural network (DNN) models. Molecular descriptors and fingerprints are used for featurization of organic molecules. Using molecular descriptors, the LASSO model uncovers that the electro-topological, electrostatic, polarizability, and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity properties are the most important physical properties to determine the membrane permeability of small drug-like molecules. Additionally, with molecular fingerprints, the LASSO model suggests that certain chemical substructures can significantly affect the permeability of organic molecules, which closely connects to the identified main physical properties. Moreover, the DNN model using molecular fingerprints can help develop a more accurate mapping between molecular structures and their membrane permeability than LASSO models. Our results provide deep understanding of drug-membrane interactions and useful guidance for the inverse molecular design of drug-like molecules. Last but not least, while the current focus is on the permeability of drug-like molecules, the methodology of this work is general and can be applied for other complex physical chemistry problems to gain molecular insights.","Chen, Guang; Shen, Zhiqiang; Li, Ying",,157,22

Physical distancing, masks, personal protective equipment worn by the doctors created difficulties in effective doctor-patient communication. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to assess the difficulties faced by patients in communicating with their doctors due to the COVID 19 preventive measures, and its impact on the trust on their doctors. METHODS: A cross sectional study of 359 persons attending a tertiary care center in Chennai, sampled in a non-probabilistic manner selected from the outpatient department, wards, and isolation facilities, was conducted using a questionnaire containing items covering three dimensions namely difficulties faced in accessing the health facility, difficulties in doctor-patient communication and trust in the doctors. The data were collected using Google Forms and analyzed using GNU PSPP open-source statistical software version 1.4.0. RESULTS: More than 60% of the participants complained of difficulty in accessing the health facility. More than 60% had difficulties in communicating with the doctors. There was a high level of trust in doctors among more than 80% of the participants. Comparison of the mean scores revealed that accessibility was a problem across ages, sexes, education and occupation groups. Communication barriers decreased with age and increased with education, but trust increased with age, but reduced with increasing education. Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed that difficulties in communication had a negative impact on trust (ß = -0.63, p<0.001) and increasing education had a negative impact on trust (ß = -0.42, p = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID 19 pandemic and the preventive strategies such as lock-down, physical distancing, face mask and personal protective equipment created barriers to effective doctor patient communication and led to some compromise in trust in doctors during this time.","Gopichandran, Vijayaprasad; Sakthivel, Kalirajan",PLoS One,157,1

Even though automation in ALL prognosis is an essential aspect of cancer diagnosis, it is challenging due to the morphological correlation between malignant and normal cells. The traditional ALL classification strategy demands experienced pathologists to carefully read the cell images, which is arduous, time-consuming, and often suffers inter-observer variations. This article has automated the ALL detection task from microscopic cell images, employing deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We explore the weighted ensemble of different deep CNNs to recommend a better ALL cell classifier. The weights for the ensemble candidate models are estimated from their corresponding metrics, such as accuracy, F1-score, AUC, and kappa values. Various data augmentations and pre-processing are incorporated for achieving a better generalization of the network. We utilize the publicly available C-NMC-2019 ALL dataset to conduct all the comprehensive experiments. Our proposed weighted ensemble model, using the kappa values of the ensemble candidates as their weights, has outputted a weighted F1-score of 88.6 %, a balanced accuracy of 86.2 %, and an AUC of 0.941 in the preliminary test set. The qualitative results displaying the gradient class activation maps confirm that the introduced model has a concentrated learned region. In contrast, the ensemble candidate models, such as Xception, VGG-16, DenseNet-121, MobileNet, and InceptionResNet-V2, separately produce coarse and scatter learned areas for most example cases. Since the proposed kappa value-based weighted ensemble yields a better result for the aimed task in this article, it can experiment in other domains of medical diagnostic applications.","Mondal, Chayan; Hasan, Md.

RESULTS: Results aligned with previous research demonstrating that sexual and gender minority youth were all at a heightened risk for depression. However, transgender youth and youth questioning their sexuality or gender were at especially heightened risk for experiencing depression and suicidality.

While we do not address all dimensions of the impact COVID-19, we highlight several troubling situations that have emerged for refugees and asylum seekers. These include entry restrictions into some countries that had formerly welcomed asylum seekers, overt and covert forms of exclusion of migrants from labor markets due to rising unemployment and economic hardship, and implementing new deportation policies, as well as new exclusionary policies for immigrants who would have been authorized to work in past. Without concerted efforts to amplify solidarity with all forced migrants and ensure their human rights, discriminatory and restrictionist policies enacted in the Global North over the past decade will become entrenched.

It has been proposed that psychiatric disorders may be risk factors and/or consequences of COVID-19 infection. However, observational studies could be affected by confounding bias. MethodsWe performed bi-directional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate causal relationships between liability to COVID-19 (and severe/critical infection) and a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders or traits. We employed the latest GWAS summary statistics from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. A variety of MR methods including those accounting for horizontal pleiotropy were used. ResultsOverall we observed evidence that liability to COVID-19 or severe infection may be causally associated with higher risks of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder (BD) (especially BD II), schizophrenia (SCZ), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and suicidal thought (ST) when compared to the general population. On the other hand, liability to a few psychiatric traits/disorders, for example ADHD, alcohol and opioid use disorders may be causally associated with higher risks of COVID-19 infection or severe disease. In genetic correlation analysis, cannabis use disorder, ADHD, and anxiety showed significant and positive genetic correlation with critical or hospitalized infection. All the above findings passed multiple testing correction at a false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05. For pneumonia, in general we observed a different pattern of associations, with bi-directional positive associations with depression- and anxiety-related phenotypes. ConclusionsIn summary, this study provides evidence for tentative bi-directional causal associations between liability to COVID-19 (and severe infection) and a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. Further replications and prospective studies are required to verify the findings.","XIANG, Yong; QIU, Jinghong; ZHANG, Ruoyu; CHAU, Carlos Kwan-Long; RAO, Shitao; Hon-Cheong, SO",,157,16

522718,522718,522718,"COVID-19 testing before endoscopy safe, effective in the US",15.474898,5.1433697,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many countries implementing lockdown procedures, resulting in the suspension of laboratory research. With lockdown measures now easing in some areas, many laboratories are preparing to reopen. This is particularly challenging for clinical research laboratories due to the dual risk of patient samples carrying the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and the risk to patients being exposed to research staff during clinical sampling. To date, no confirmed transmission of the virus has been confirmed within a laboratory setting; however, operating processes and procedures should be adapted to ensure safe working of samples of positive, negative, or unknown COVID-19 status. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we propose a framework for reopening a clinical research laboratory and resuming operations with the aim to maximize research capacity while minimizing the risk to research participants and staff. METHODS: This framework was developed by consensus among experienced laboratory staff who have prepared to reopen a clinical research laboratory. RESULTS: Multiple aspects need to be considered to reopen a clinical laboratory. We describe our process to stratify projects by risk, including assessment of donor risk and COVID-19 clinical status, the COVID-19 status of the specific sample type, and how to safely process each sample type. We describe methods to prepare the laboratory for safe working including maintaining social distancing through signage, one-way systems and access arrangements for staff and patients, limiting staff numbers on site and encouraging home working for all nonlaboratory tasks including data analysis and writing. Shared equipment usage was made safe by adapting booking systems to allow for the deployment of cleaning protocols. All risk assessments and standard operating procedures were rewritten and approved by local committees, and staff training was initiated to ensure compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Laboratories can adopt and adapt this framework to expedite reopening a clinical laboratory during the current COVID-19 pandemic while mitigating the risk to research participants and staff.","Walker, Eloise M; Jasper, Alice E; Davis, Lauren; Yip, Kay Por; Faniyi, Aduragbemi A; Hughes, Michael J; Crisford, Helena A; Spittle, Daniella A; Sapey, Elizabeth; Belchamber, Kylie B R; Scott, Aaron",JMIR Res Protoc,157,1

However, the required number of tests may increase substantially under real-world practical constraints, notably including bounds on the maximum number $\Delta$ of tests an individual can be placed in, or the maximum number $\Gamma$ of individuals in a given test. While previous works have given recovery guarantees for these settings, significant gaps remain between the achievability and converse bounds. In this paper, we substantially or completely close several of the most prominent gaps. In the case of $\Delta$-divisible items, we show that the definite defectives (DD) algorithm coupled with a random regular design is asymptotically optimal in dense scaling regimes, and optimal to within a factor of $e$ more generally; we establish this by strengthening both the best known achievability and converse bounds. In the case of $\Gamma$-sized tests, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the regime $\Gamma = \Theta(1)$, and again establish a precise threshold proving the asymptotic optimality of DD equipped with a tailored pooling scheme. Finally, for each of these two settings, we provide near-optimal adaptive algorithms based on sequential splitting, and provably demonstrate gaps between the performance of optimal adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms.","Gebhard, Oliver; Hahn-Klimroth, Max; Parczyk, Olaf; Penschuck, Manuel; Rolvien, Maurice; Scarlett, Jonathan; Tan, Nelvin",,157,1

Importantly, older adults are particularly vulnerable to get severe illness, complications, and to have a higher mortality rate than any other age group. The clinical presentation in older adults with severe illness, in the experience from geriatricians in Lombardy, is described as quite sudden; patients can develop severe hypoxemia with the need of ventilation support in few hours. Geriatric syndromes are not a common form of presentation for COVID-19 in severe illness. It is suggested that stratification by frailty level may help to detect the most vulnerable, and decisions about healthcare resource prioritization should not be taken based only on age itself or previous diagnosis, such as having dementia.","Cesari, Matteo; Montero-Odasso, Manuel",Canadian Geriatrics J.,157,26

However, there is limited information regarding patients' satisfaction with TeleNP. This report presents satisfaction survey data from a diverse, clinical sample who received TeleNP during the coronavirus disease pandemic. METHOD: A total of 43 adult patients (30.2% Hispanic/Latinx, 32.6% Black), aged 24-75, who received TeleNP as part of routine clinical care participated in a postassessment satisfaction survey. Responses were analyzed qualitatively and via nonparametric comparisons based on demographic factors. RESULTS: Given options of ""Not Satisfied,"" ""Somewhat Satisfied,"" ""Satisfied,"" or ""Very Satisfied,"" 97.7% of patients reported satisfaction with their visit as well as the visit length, and 80% felt the visit met their needs (""Good"" + ""Very Good""). There were no significant differences in responses based on age, race/ethnicity, sex, or education. Endorsed advantages of TeleNP included ""Avoid potential exposure to illness"" and ""Flexibility/Convenience,"" and 20% reported difficulty communicating, concentrating, and/or connecting with their provider as potential disadvantages. Although 67.7% reported a preference for in-person visits, 83.7% expressed interest in another ""virtual visit"" (telephone or video conference) with their provider. CONCLUSIONS: TeleNP was well received by the sample and demonstrated good patient satisfaction. These results in conjunction with other research supporting the validity of TeleNP support consideration of this assessment modality for patients who might not otherwise have access to in-person or video conference-based neuropsychological services. Based on these findings, a greater focus on rapport building may be warranted when utilizing TeleNP to enhance patients' sense of connection to their provider.","Lacritz, Laura H; Carlew, Anne R; Livingstone, Julia; Bailey, K Chase; Parker, Allison; Diaz, Aislinn",Arch Clin Neuropsychol,157,16

Genomic epidemiology has emerged as a valuable tool to understand introductions and spread of the virus in a specific geographic location. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report the sequences of 59 SARS-CoV-2 samples from inhabitants of the Colombian Amazonas department. The viral genomes were distributed in two robust clusters within the distinct GISAID clades GH and G. Spatial-temporal analyses revealed two independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in the region, one around April 1, 2020 associated with a local transmission, and one around April 2, 2020 associated with other South American genomes (Uruguay and Brazil). We also identified ten lineages circulating in the Amazonas department including the P.1 variant of concern (VOC). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study represents the first genomic epidemiology investigation of SARS-CoV-2 in one of the territories with the highest report of indigenous communities of the country. Such findings are essential to decipher viral transmission, inform on global spread and to direct implementation of infection prevention and control measures for these vulnerable populations, especially, due to the recent circulation of one of the variants of concern (P.1) associated with major transmissibility and possible reinfections.","Ballesteros, Nathalia; Muñoz, Marina; Patiño, Luz Helena; Hernández, Carolina; González-Casabianca, Felipe; Carroll, Iván; Santos-Vega, Mauricio; Cascante, Jaime; Angel, Andrés; Feged-Rivadeneira, Alejandro; Palma-Cuero, Mónica; Flórez, Carolina; Gomez, Sergio; van de Guchte, Adriana; Khan, Zenab; Dutta, Jayeeta; Obla, Ajay; Alshammary, Hala Alejel; Gonzalez-Reiche, Ana S; Hernandez, Matthew M; Sordillo, Emilia Mia; Simon, Viviana; van Bakel, Harm; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto E; Ramírez, Juan David",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,157,24

Here, we explore the possibility that those species that tolerate or do well in human-modified environments, or ‘synanthropic’ species, are predominantly the hosts of zoonotic emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). We do this using global wildlife conservation data and wildlife host information extracted from systematically reviewed emerging infectious disease literature. The evidence for this relationship is examined with special emphasis on the Australasian, South East Asian and East Asian regions. We find that synanthropic wildlife hosts are approximately 15 times more likely than other wildlife in this region to be the source of emerging infectious diseases, and this association is essentially independent of the taxonomy of the species. A significant positive association with EIDs is also evident for those wildlife species of low conservation risk. Since the increase and spread of native and introduced species able to adapt to human-induced landscape change is at the expense of those species most vulnerable to habitat loss, our findings suggest a mechanism linking land conversion, global decline in biodiversity and a rise in EIDs of wildlife origin.","McFarlane, Ro; Sleigh, Adrian; McMichael, Tony",Ecohealth,157,17

The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is considered the combination of severe and high infectivity. Herd immunity is attained when a critical proportion of the population is immune, providing the virus with fewer chances to spread locally. To overcome the rising tide of the COVID-19 pandemic, efficacious and safe vaccines providing defensive and long-lasting immunity responses are urgently needed. Vaccines that induce virus-neutralizing antibodies with great affinity can optimally fight against infection. Worldwide, over 120 novel vaccine candidates, including live-attenuated, inactivated, viral-vectored nonreplicating and replicating, peptide- and protein-based, and nucleic acid-based approaches are in the process of preclinical and clinical trials (phase 1 to 4). In addition to comprehensive safety assessments and immune responses, precise clinical management is also important for trials of vaccines. The recent emergence of different variants of SARS-CoV-2 is becoming a new threat for the world and a challenge for scientists to introduce the most influential vaccine against COVID-19. The possibility of natural and vaccine-induced immunity in variants finds it necessary to establish next-generation vaccines, which generate general neutralization against existing and future variants. Here, we summarize the cellular and humoral responses of SARS-CoV-2, current progress in vaccination development, the antibody titer response of available phase 4 vaccinations in vaccinated populations of different countries worldwide, and the success and challenges ahead of vaccine development.","Hussain, Asim; Rafeeq, Hamza; Memoona Asif, Hafiza; Shabbir, Sumaira; Bilal, Muhammad; Mulla, Sikandar I.; Franco, Marcelo; Iqbal, Hafiz M.N.",Int Immunopharmacol,157,16

During such an outbreak, some needs of high-risk groups who require regular follow-ups and long-term management are not met. The vulnerable populations include patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Duchenne muscular dystrophy is characterized by respiratory complications caused by muscle weakness. Hence, patients with this condition are at high risk of severe diseases including COVID-19. Methods: To standardize care and provide optimal treatment to DMD patients in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic, a panel of experts including neurologists and pediatricians consolidated recommendations for healthcare professionals and caregivers. Results: During this pandemic, substituting unnecessary clinic visits with virtual clinic services was highly recommended, if possible, without compromising clinical outcomes. Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients with respiratory complications should be closely monitored, and those with cardiovascular complications must continue taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Moreover, individualized home-based rehabilitation management was preferred. Glucocorticoid and new gene correction therapies should be continued. However, new gene correction therapy must be post-poned in newly diagnosed patients. A multidisciplinary decision was required before the initiation of hydroxychloroquine based on the COVID-19 treatment protocol. Conclusion: COVID-19 has caused challenges and transformed access to health care. However, these limitations have provided opportunities for the health care system to adapt.

ZIKV pathogenicity is initiated by viral infection and propagation across multiple placental and fetal tissue barriers, and is critically strengthened by subverting host immunity. ZIKV immune evasion involves viral non-structural proteins, genomic and non-coding RNA and microRNA (miRNA) to modulate interferon (IFN) signaling and production, interfering with intracellular signal pathways and autophagy, and promoting cellular environment changes together with secretion of cellular components to escape innate and adaptive immunity and further infect privileged immune organs/tissues such as the placenta and eyes.

That is, if infection is completely blocked with antiviral drugs (100% inhibition), the duration of viral shedding is minimal and is determined by the length of virus production. However, some mathematical models predict that if infected individuals are treated with antiviral drugs with efficacy below 100%, viral shedding may last longer than without treatment because further de novo infections are driven by entry of the virus into partially protected, uninfected cells at a slower rate. Using a simple mathematical model, we quantified SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in non-human primates and characterized the kinetics of viral shedding. We counterintuitively found that treatments initiated early, such as 0.5 d after virus inoculation, with intermediate to relatively high efficacy (30–70% inhibition of virus replication) yield a prolonged duration of viral shedding (by about 6.0 d) compared with no treatment.","Kim, Kwang Su; Iwanami, Shoya; Oda, Takafumi; Fujita, Yasuhisa; Kuba, Keiji; Miyazaki, Taiga; Ejima, Keisuke; Iwami, Shingo",Life Sci Alliance,157,16

Of seropositive subjects 19.2% (14/73) had acute respiratory illness. Fever, diarrhea and the absence of cough and runny nose were associated with seropositivity in individuals aged 50 or more years. IgG concentrations were higher if fever, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, chest pain or diarrhea was present, or hospitalization required. Conclusion: Similarly to other European countries the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Estonia was low even in the hotspot region Saaremaa suggesting that majority of population is still susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Focusing only on respiratory symptoms may delay accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jogi, P.; Soeorg, H.; Ingerainen, D.; Soots, M.; Lattekivi, F.; Naaber, P.; Toompere, K.; Peterson, P.; Haljasmagi, L.; Zusinaite, E.; Vaas, H.; Pauskar, M.; Shablinskaja, A.; Kaarna, K.; Paluste, H.; Kisand, K.; Oona, M.; Janno, R.; Lutsar, I.",,157,1

We aimed to establish immunological, virological, and routine laboratory markers, which, in combination with clinical information, may allow identifying such patients. METHODS: Blood tests to measure neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and levels of ferritin, CRP, D-dimer, complement components (C3 and C4), cytokines, and lymphocyte subsets, as well as SARS-Cov-2 RT-PCR tests, were performed in COVID-19-confirmed cases within 48 hours of admission. RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values from oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs were determined on the day of admission. Symptom severity was categorized as mild (grade 1), severe (grade 2), or critical (grade 3). RESULTS: Of 120 patients who were included, 49 had mild, 32 severe, and 39 critical COVID-19. Levels of ferritin >370 ng/mL (OR 16.4, 95% CI 5.3–50.8), D-dimer >440 ng/mL (OR 5.45, 95% CI 2.36–12.61), CRP >7.65 mg/dL (OR 11.54, 95% CI 4.3–30.8), NLR >3.77 (OR 13.4, 95% CI 4.3–41.1), IL-6 >142.5 pg/mL (OR 8.76, 95% CI 3.56–21.54), IL-10 >10.8 pg/mL (OR 16.45, 95% CI 5.32–50.81), sIL-2rα (sCD25) >804.5 pg/mL (OR 14.06, 95% CI 4.56–43.28), IL-1Ra >88.4 pg/mL (OR 4.54, 95% CI 2.03–10.17), and IL-18 >144 pg/mL (OR 17.85, 95% CI 6.54–48.78) were associated with critical COVID-19 in the univariate age-adjusted analysis. This association was confirmed in the multivariate age-adjusted analysis only for ferritin, CRP, NLR, IL-10, sIL-2rα, and IL-18. T, B, and NK cells were significantly decreased in critical patients. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in blood except in 3 patients who had indeterminate results. RT-PCR Ct values from oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs on admission were not related to symptom severity. CONCLUSION: Ferritin, D-dimer, CRP, NLR, cytokine (IL-18 and IL-10), and cytokine receptor (IL-6, IL1-Ra, and sCD25) test results combined with clinical data can contribute to the early identification of critical COVID-19 patients.","García-Gasalla, Mercedes; Ferrer, Juana M.; Fraile-Ribot, Pablo A.; Ferre-Beltrán, Adrián; Rodríguez, Adrián; Martínez-Pomar, Natalia; Ramon-Clar, Luisa; Iglesias, Amanda; Losada-López, Inés; Fanjul, Francisco; Pou, Joan Albert; Llompart-Alabern, Isabel; Toledo, Nuria; Pons, Jaime; Oliver, Antonio; Riera, Melchor; Murillas, Javier",Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol,157,27

In this paper, we argue that fertility decisions are not a mere “statistical shadow of the past”, and advance the Narrative Framework, a new approach to the relationship between economic uncertainty and fertility. This framework proffers that individuals act according to or despite uncertainty based on their “narrative of the future” – imagined futures embedded in social elements and their interactions. We also posit that personal narratives of the future are shaped by the “shared narratives” produced by socialization agents, including parents and peers, as well as by the narratives produced by the media and other powerful opinion formers. Finally, within this framework, we propose several empirical strategies, from both a qualitative and a quantitative perspective, including an experimental approach, for assessing the role of narratives of the future in fertility decisions.","Vignoli, Daniele; Guetto, Raffaele; Bazzani, Giacomo; Pirani, Elena; Minello, Alessandra",Genus,157,1

We find that marked, asynchronous reductions of the basic reproductive number occurred throughout the United States in association with social distancing and other control measures. Counterfactual simulations indicate that, had these same measures been implemented 1 to 2 weeks earlier, substantial cases and deaths could have been averted and that delayed responses to future increased incidence will facilitate a stronger rebound of infections and death.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether point‐of‐care (POC) PCR testing can be used to reduce staff sick days and improve diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether point‐of‐care (POC) PCR testing can be used to reduce staff sick days and improve diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. METHODS: Using a cross‐over design, the cobas® Liat® Influenza A/B POC PCR test (Liat) was compared with standard clinical practice during the 2019/2020 influenza season. All adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with fever (≥38°C) and respiratory symptoms were included. Primary end points were the prevalence of influenza infections in the ED and staff sick days. Secondary end points were frequency of antiviral and antibacterial therapy, time between admission and test result or treatment initiation, patient disposition, ED length of stay (LOS), and for inpatients mortality and LOS. Nurses were interviewed about handling and integration of POC testing. The occurrence of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections coincided with the second half of the study. RESULTS: A total of 828 patients were enrolled in the study. All 375 patients of the intervention group were tested with Liat, and 103 patients of them (27.6%) tested positive. During the intervention period, staff sick days were reduced by 34.4% (P = .023). Significantly, more patients in the intervention group received antiviral therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors (7.2% vs 3.8%, P = .028) and tested patients received antibiotics more frequently (40.0% vs 31.6%, P = .033). Patients with POC test were transferred to external hospitals significantly more often (5.6% vs 1.3%, P = .01). CONCLUSION: We conclude that POC testing for influenza is useful in the ED, especially if it is heavily frequented by patients with respiratory symptoms.","Perlitz, Benjamin; Slagman, Anna; Hitzek, Jennifer; Riedlinger, Dorothee; Möckel, Martin",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,157,20

It is a challenge to implement timely and appropriate public health interventions. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Population and COVID-19 epidemiological data between 21st January 2020 to 15th November 2020 from 216 countries and territories were included with the implemented public health interventions. We used deep reinforcement learning, and the algorithm was trained to enable agents to try to find optimal public health strategies that maximized total reward on controlling the spread of COVID-19. The results suggested by the algorithm were analyzed against the actual timing and intensity of lockdown and travel restrictions. Early implementations of the actual lockdown and travel restriction policies, usually at the time of local index case were associated with less burden of COVID-19. In contrast, our agent suggested to initiate at least minimal intensity of lockdown or travel restriction even before or on the day of the index case in each country and territory. In addition, the agent mostly recommended a combination of lockdown and travel restrictions and higher intensity policies than the policies implemented by governments, but did not always encourage rapid full lockdown and full border closures. The limitation of this study was that it was done with incomplete data due to the emerging COVID-19 epidemic, inconsistent testing and reporting. In addition, our research focuses only on population health benefits by controlling the spread of COVID-19 without balancing the negative impacts of economic and social consequences. INTERPRETATION: Compared to actual government implementation, our algorithm mostly recommended earlier intensity of lockdown and travel restrictions. Reinforcement learning may be used as a decision support tool for implementation of public health interventions during COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Kwak, Gloria Hyunjung; Ling, Lowell; Hui, Pan",PLoS One,157,26

Despite this, reliable clinical performance data is sparse. Methods In a prospective performance evaluation study, RDT from three manufacturers (NADAL, Panbio, MEDsan) were compared to quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in 5 068 oropharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a hospital setting. Viral load was derived from standardized RT-qPCR Cycle threshold (Ct) values. The data collection period ranged from November 12, 2020 to February 28, 2021. Findings Overall, sensitivity of RDT compared to RT-qPCR was 42.57% (95% CI 33.38%-52.31%), and specificity 99.68% (95% CI 99.48%-99.80%). Sensitivity declined with decreasing viral load from 100% in samples with a deduced viral load of 10^8 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per ml to 8.82% in samples with a viral load lower than 104 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per ml. No significant differences in sensitivity or specificity could be observed between the three manufacturers, or between samples with and without spike protein variant B.1.1.7. The NPV in the study cohort was 98.84%; the PPV in persons with typical COVID-19 symptoms was 97.37%, and 28.57% in persons without or with atypical symptoms. Interpretation RDT are a reliable method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in persons with high viral load. RDT are a valuable addition to RT-qPCR testing, as they reliably detect infectious persons with high viral loads before RT-qPCR results are available.

Thus, various technologies that allow for the fast detection of COVID-19 infections with high accuracy can offer healthcare professionals much-needed help. This study is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest X-rays (CXRs). The dataset used in the experiments consists of 1200 CXR images from individuals with COVID-19, 1345 CXR images from individuals with viral pneumonia, and 1341 CXR images from healthy individuals. In this paper, the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and precise identification of COVID-19 from CXR images has been explored based on different pretrained deep learning algorithms and fine-tuned to maximise detection accuracy to identify the best algorithms. The results showed that deep learning with X-ray imaging is useful in collecting critical biological markers associated with COVID-19 infections. VGG16 and MobileNet obtained the highest accuracy of 98.28%. However, VGG16 outperformed all other models in COVID-19 detection with an accuracy, F1 score, precision, specificity, and sensitivity of 98.72%, 97.59%, 96.43%, 98.70%, and 98.78%, respectively. The outstanding performance of these pretrained models can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis. However, a larger dataset of COVID-19 X-ray images is required for a more accurate and reliable identification of COVID-19 infections when using deep transfer learning. This would be extremely beneficial in this pandemic when the disease burden and the need for preventive measures are in conflict with the currently available resources.","Taresh, Mundher Mohammed; Zhu, Ningbo; Ali, Talal Ahmed Ali; Hameed, Asaad Shakir; Mutar, Modhi Lafta",Int J Biomed Imaging,157,1

The extent of that increased risk compared to the general population and the groups most at risk have not been extensively studied. Methods: A prospective observational study of health and social care workers in NHS Tayside (Scotland, UK) from May to September 2020. The Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay was used to establish seroprevalence in this cohort. Patients provided clinical information including demographics and workplace information. Controls, matched for age and sex to the general Tayside population, were studied for comparison. Results: A total of 2062 health and social care workers were recruited for this study. The participants were predominantly female (81.7%) and 95.2% were white. 299 healthcare workers had a positive antibody test (14.5%). 11 out of 231 control sera tested positive (4.8%). Healthcare workers therefore had an increased likelihood of a positive test (odds ratio 3.4 95% CI 1.85-6.16, p<0.0001). Dentists, healthcare assistants and porters were the job roles most likely to test positive. Those working in front-line roles with COVID-19 patients were more likely to test positive (17.4% vs. 13.4%, p=0.02). 97.1% of patients who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR had positive antibodies, compared to 11.8% of individuals with a symptomatic illness who had tested negative. Anosmia was the symptom most associated with the presence of detectable antibodies. Conclusion: In this study, healthcare workers were three times more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than the general population.

Acute care surgeons, although not directly involved in treating COVID-19 + patients, have often modified their daily activity to help in this crisis. We have designed the first Italian survey on the effect of COVID-19 outbreak on Acute Care Surgery activity and submitted it to emergency surgeons in all the country to evaluate the experiences, trends, attitudes and possible educational outcomes that this emergency brought to light. A total of 532 valid surveys were collected during the study period. Lombardy and Lazio had the major answer rate. 96% of responders noticed a decrease in surgical emergencies. The outbreak affected regions and hospitals in different ways depending on the local incidence of infection. Half of responders modified their approach to intra-abdominal infections towards a more conservative treatment. 43% of responders, mainly in the North, were shifted to assist non-surgical patients. There has been a direct but non-homogeneous involvement of emergency surgeons. Almost all hospitals have responded with specific pathways and training. Both emergency surgery and trauma activity have changed and generally decreased but the majority of surgeons have operated on suspected COVID-19 patients.

Nine databases were searched for studies on inflammatory markers of MIS‐C. After quality checks, data were pooled using a fixed or random effects model. Inflammatory markers included white blood cell count (WBC) or leukocytes, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelet count (PLT), C‐reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), ferritin, D‐dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), fibrinogen, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for comparisons by severity and age. Twenty‐one studies with 1735 participants yielded 787 MIS‐C patients. Compared to non‐severe COVID‐19 patients, MIS‐C patients had lower ALC and higher ANC, CRP, and D‐dimer levels. Compared to severe COVID‐19 patients, MIS‐C patients had lower LDH and PLT counts and higher ESR levels. Severe MIS‐C patients had higher levels of WBC, ANC, CRP, D‐dimer, and ferritin than non‐severe MIS‐C patients. For MIS‐C, younger children (0–5 years) had lower CRP and ferritin levels than middle‐aged/older children/adolescents.

Repurposing existing drugs offers the fastest opportunity to identify new indications for existing drugs as a stable solution against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) is a critical target for designing potent antiviral agents against COVID-19. In this study, we identify potential inhibitors against COVID-19, using an amalgam of virtual screening, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and binding-free energy approaches from the Korea Chemical Bank drug repurposing (KCB-DR) database. The database screening of KCB-DR resulted in 149 binders. The dynamics of protein-drug complex formation for the seven top scoring drugs were investigated through MD simulations. Six drugs showed stable binding with active site of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) indicated by steady RMSD of protein backbone atoms and potential energy profiles. Furthermore, binding free energy calculations suggested the community-acquired bacterial pneumonia drug ceftaroline fosamil and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor telaprevir are potent inhibitors against M(pro). Molecular dynamics and interaction analysis revealed that ceftaroline fosamil and telaprevir form hydrogen bonds with important active site residues such as Thr24, Thr25, His41, Thr45, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, and Glu166 that is supported by crystallographic information of known inhibitors. Telaprevir has potential side effects, but its derivatives have good pharmacokinetic properties and are suggested to bind M(pro). We suggest the telaprevir derivatives and ceftaroline fosamil bind tightly with SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and should be validated through preclinical testing.","Kumar, Raj; Kumar, Vikas; Lee, Keun Woo",Comput Biol Med,157,1

Macrolides have frequently been used in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This study investigated the association of macrolides with 90-day mortality and MERS coronavirus (CoV) RNA clearance in critically ill patients with MERS. METHODS: This retrospective analysis of a multicenter cohort database included 14 tertiary-care hospitals in five cities in Saudi Arabia. Multivariate logistic-regression analysis was used to determine the association of macrolide therapy with 90-day mortality, and the Cox-proportional hazard model to determine the association of macrolide therapy with MERS-CoV RNA clearance. RESULTS: Of 349 critically ill MERS patients, 136 (39%) received macrolide therapy. Azithromycin was most commonly used (97/136; 71.3%). Macrolide therapy was commonly started before the patient arrived in the intensive care unit (ICU) (51/136; 37.5%), or on day1 in ICU (53/136; 39%). On admission to ICU, the baseline characteristics of patients who received and did not receive macrolides were similar, including demographic data and sequential organ failure assessment score. However, patients who received macrolides were more likely to be admitted with community-acquired MERS (P = 0.02). Macrolide therapy was not independently associated with a significant difference in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] :0.47–1.51; P = 0.56) or MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted HR: 0.88; 95% CI:0.47–1.64; P = 0.68).

In some cases, this proves to be insufficient, with a refractory respiratory failure calling for an extracorporeal approach (veno-venous ECMO). In this scenario, most of these patients need an early tracheostomy procedure to be carried out, which creates the risk of distribution of aerosol particles, possibly leading to personnel infection. The use of apneic tracheostomy has been proposed for COVID-19 patients, but in case of ECMO it may produce lung derecruitment, severe hypoxemia, and sudden worsening of respiratory mechanics. We developed an apneic tracheostomy technique and applied it in over 32 patients supported by veno-venous ECMO. We present data showing the safety and feasibility of this technique in terms of patient care and personnel protection. Gas exchange and pH did not show statistically significant changes after the tracheostomy, nor did respiratory mechanics data or the need for inspiratory pressure and FiO(2). The use of apneic tracheostomy was a safe option for patient care during ECMO and reduced the possibility of virus spreading.","Rossetti, Matteo; Vitiello, Chiara; Campitelli, Valeria; Cuffaro, Raffaele; Bianco, Claudia; Martucci, Gennaro; Panarello, Giovanna; Pappalardo, Federico; Arcadipane, Antonio",Membranes (Basel),157,16

The efficacy of such vector-based vaccines depends on functional interactions with receptors on host cells. Adenoviruses of different species are assumed to enter host cells mainly by interactions between the knob domain of the protruding fiber capsid protein and cellular receptors. Using a cell-based receptor-screening assay, we identified CD46 as a receptor for HAdV-D56. The function of CD46 was validated in infection experiments using cells lacking and overexpressing CD46, and by competition infection experiments using soluble CD46. Remarkably, unlike HAdV-B types that engage CD46 through interactions with the knob domain of the fiber protein, HAdV-D types infect host cells through a direct interaction between CD46 and the hexon protein. Soluble hexon proteins (but not fiber knob) inhibited HAdV-D56 infection, and surface plasmon analyses demonstrated that CD46 binds to HAdV-D hexon (but not fiber knob) proteins. Cryoelectron microscopy analysis of the HAdV-D56 virion–CD46 complex confirmed the interaction and showed that CD46 binds to the central cavity of hexon trimers. Finally, soluble CD46 inhibited infection by 16 out of 17 investigated HAdV-D types, suggesting that CD46 is an important receptor for a large group of adenoviruses. In conclusion, this study identifies a noncanonical entry mechanism used by human adenoviruses, which adds to the knowledge of adenovirus biology and can also be useful for development of adenovirus-based vaccine vectors.","Persson, B.

Disease diagnosis is generally accomplished using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to amplify nucleic acids in patient samples, permitting detection even at low target concentrations. However, qPCR requires expensive equipment, trained personnel, and significant time. These resources are not available in POC settings, driving researchers to instead utilize isothermal amplification, conducted at a single temperature, as an alternative. Common isothermal amplification methods include loop-mediated isothermal amplification, recombinase polymerase amplification, rolling circle amplification, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, and helicase-dependent amplification. There has been a growing interest in combining such amplification methods with POC detection methods to enable the development of diagnostic tests that are well suited for resource-limited settings as well as developed countries performing mass screenings. Exciting developments have been made in the integration of these two research areas due to the significant impact that such approaches can have on healthcare. This review will primarily focus on advances made by North American research groups between 2015 and June 2020, and will emphasize integrated approaches that reduce user steps, reliance on expensive equipment, and the system's time-to-result.","Pumford, Elizabeth A.; Lu, Jiakun; Spaczai, Iza; Prasetyo, Matthew E.; Zheng, Elaine M.; Zhang, Hanxu; Kamei, Daniel T.",Biosens Bioelectron,157,20

Respondents reported high levels of depression (43.3%, PHQ-8 scores ≥ 10), high anxiety scores (45.4%, GAD-7 scores ≥ 10), and high levels of PTSD symptoms (31.8%, PCL-C scores ≥ 45). High levels of loneliness, high levels of COVID-19-specific worries, and low distress tolerance were significantly associated with clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Resilience was associated with low levels of depression and anxiety symptoms but not PTSD. Most respondents had high levels of social support; social support from family, but not from partner or peers, was associated with low levels of depression and PTSD.

Over several decades, the characterization of mouse mutants has illuminated the relationship between gene and phenotype, providing transformational insights into the genetic bases of disease. However, if we are to deliver the promise of genomic and precision medicine, we must develop a comprehensive catalogue of mammalian gene function that uncovers the dark genome and elucidates pleiotropy. Advances in large-scale mouse mutagenesis programmes allied to high-throughput mouse phenomics are now addressing this challenge and systematically revealing novel gene function and multi-morbidities. Alongside the development of these pan-genomic mutational resources, mouse genetics is employing a range of diversity resources to delineate gene–gene and gene–environment interactions and to explore genetic context. Critically, mouse genetics is a powerful tool for assessing the functional impact of human genetic variation and determining the causal relationship between variant and disease. Together these approaches provide unique opportunities to dissect in vivo mechanisms and systems to understand pathophysiology and disease.

There is uncertainty as to what the significance of this dual infection is, and whether people living with HIV (PLWH) have worse outcomes compared to HIV-negative patients with COVID-19. This study compared the outcomes of COVID-19 in a group of HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients admitted to a tertiary referral centre in Johannesburg, South Africa. Methods: Data was collected on all adult patients with known HIV status and COVID-19, confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), admitted to the medical wards and intensive care unit (ICU) between 6 March and 11 September 2020. The data included demographics, co-morbidities, laboratory results, severity of illness scores, complications and mortality and comparisons were made between the HIV-positive and HIV negative groups. Results: Three-hundred and eighty-four patients, 108 HIV-positive and 276 HIV-negative, were included in the study. Median 4C score was significantly higher in the HIV-positive patients compared to the HIV-negative patients but there was no significant difference in mortality between the HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups (15% vs 20%, p = 0.31). In addition, HIV-positive patients who died were younger than their HIV-negative counterparts, but this was not statistically significant (47.5 vs 57 years, p = 0.06).

These individuals account for much of the rapid increase in cases of dementing illness throughout the world but remain underrepresented in the body of literature on this topic. The aim of this review is first to outline the unique contributing factors and complications that must be considered by clinicians in evaluating an oldest-old individual with cognitive complaints. Secondly, the evidence for management of these cognitive concerns is reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to well-established associations between impaired cognition and physical disability, falls, and frailty, there is now evidence that exercise performed decades earlier confers a cognitive benefit in the oldest-old. Moreover, though aggressive blood pressure control is critical earlier in life for prevention of strokes, renal disease, and other comorbidities, hypertension started after age 80 is in fact associated with a decreased risk of clinical dementia, carrying significant implications for the medical management of oldest-old individuals. The oldest-old are more likely to reside in care facilities, where social isolation might be exacerbated by a consistently lower rate of internet-connected device use. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only highlighted the increased mortality rate among the oldest-old but has also brought the increased social isolation in this group to the forte. SUMMARY: Differing from the “younger-old” in a number of respects, the oldest-old is a unique population not just in their vulnerability to cognitive disorders but also in the diagnostic challenges they can pose. The oldest-old are more likely to be afflicted by sensory deficits, physical disability, poor nutrition, frailty, and depression, which must be accounted for in the assessment of cognitive complaints as they may confound or complicate the presentation. Social isolation and institutionalization are also associated with impaired cognition, perhaps as sequelae, precipitants, or both. Ante-mortem diagnostic tools remain particularly limited among the oldest-old, especially given the likelihood of these individuals to have multiple co-occurring types of neuropathology, and the presence of neuropathology in those who remain cognitively intact. In addition to the symptomatic treatments indicated for patients of all ages with dementia, management of cognitive impairment in the oldest-old may be further optimized by use of assistive devices, augmentation of dietary protein, and liberalization of medication regimens for risk factors such as hypertension.","Borders, Candace; Sajjadi, Seyed Ahmad",Curr Treat Options Neurol,157,28

A single center retrospective study was conducted to quantify losses due to postponement of elective surgeries and extra cost for procurement of PPEs. The secondary objective was to see the effect of Covid −19 on the total costs of inpatient care during Covid era. PATIENT AND METHOD: We included all the patients admitted in orthopedic section for operative intervention of fractures and elective procedures from January 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020. We divided this period into two halves; the first half was from January first to March 15 named as PreCovid Era and second half was from March 16, to May 31, 2020, termed as Covid Era. The total number of trauma procedures and elective procedures were compared in both eras. We compared six procedures each from upper and lower limit for cost analysis and length of stay. We also analyzed the extra cost for procurement of PPEs. RESULTS: A total 625 patients were admitted during study period; 417 in precovid and 208 in covid era. There was 50% reduction in patients admissions during Covid era. There was no statistically significant difference in age and gender of both groups. A total of 840 (591in preCovid era and 251 in Covid era) procedures were performed on these 625 patients. Elective and emergency procedures were significantly reduced in Covid era.

For many years, AAVs have been considered as low immunogenic vectors due to their ability to induce long-term expression of non-self-proteins in contrast to what has been observed with other viral vectors, such as adenovirus, for which strong immune responses against the same transgene products were documented. The perceived low immunogenicity likely explains why the use of AAV vectors for vaccination was not seriously considered before the early 2000s. Indeed, while analyses conducted using a variety of transgenes and animal species slowly changed the vision of immunological properties of AAVs, an increasing number of studies were also performed in the field of vaccination. Even if the comparison with other modes of vaccination was not systemically performed, the analyses conducted so far in the field of active immunotherapy strongly suggest that AAVs possess some interesting features to be used as tools to produce an efficient and sustained antibody response. In addition, recent studies also highlighted the potential of AAVs for passive immunotherapy. This review summarizes the main studies conducted to evaluate the potential of AAV vectors for vaccination against infectious agents and discusses their advantages and drawbacks. Altogether, the variety of studies conducted in this field contributes to the understanding of the immunological properties of this versatile virus and to the definition of its possible future applications.","Nieto, Karen; Salvetti, Anna",Front Immunol,157,28

Evidence on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection is scarce in secondary care settings in Western populations. METHODS: We describe the clinical characteristics of all consecutive COVID-19 positive patients (n = 215) admitted to the acute medical unit at Fairfield General Hospital (secondary care setting) between 23 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 based on the outcome at discharge (group 1: alive or group 2: deceased). We investigated the risk factors that were associated with mortality using binary logistic regression analysis. Kaplan-Meir (KM) curves were generated by following the outcome in all patients until 12 May 2020. RESULTS: The median age of our cohort was 74 years with a predominance of Caucasians (87.4%) and males (62%). Of the 215 patients, 86 (40%) died. A higher proportion of patients who died were frail (group 2: 63 vs group 1: 37%, p < 0.001), with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (group 2: 58 vs group 1: 33%, p < 0.001) and respiratory diseases (group 2: 38 vs group 1: 25%, p = 0.03). In the multivariate logistic regression models, older age (odds ratio (OR) 1.03; p = 0.03), frailty (OR 5.1; p < 0.001) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on admission (OR 0.98; p = 0.01) were significant predictors of inpatient mortality. KM curves showed a significantly shorter survival time in the frail older patients.

Despite consensus within the public health community about the need to reduce sugar intake, the non-alcoholic beverage industry engages in efforts to publicly undermine the evidence base surrounding the harmful effects of SSBs. There has been limited investigation of how SSB industry actors engage in public debates to challenge public health research and policy on SSBs. To address this gap, we thematically analyze the public comments and press releases of the British Soft Drinks Association (BSDA) since May 2014. RESULTS: A total of 175 news articles and 7 press releases were identified where the BSDA commented upon new SSB research in public settings. In these comments, four strategies were observed to undermine new research. First, the BSDA challenged study rigour and research design (n = 150). They challenged the policy implications of research by stating observational studies do not demonstrate causation, refuted data sources, questioned researcher motivations, and claimed research design did not account for confounding factors. Second, the BSDA positioned themselves as an altruistic public health partner (n = 52) intent on improving population-level nutrition citing their voluntary industry commitments. Third, the BSDA promoted concepts of safety that align with industry interests (n = 47). Lastly, the BSDA argued that the lifestyle of individual consumers should be the focus of public health interventions rather than the industry (n = 61). CONCLUSION: The findings illustrate the BSDA reliance on arguments of causation to discredit research and avoid policy interventions. Given the attention by the BSDA regarding the purported lack of evidence of causation between SSBs and non-communicable diseases, it is imperative that members of the public health community try to educate policy makers about (a) the complex nature of causation; (b) that evidence in favour of public health interventions cannot, and do not, solely rely on causation studies; and (c) that public health must sometimes abide by the precautionary principle in instituting interventions.","Zenone, Marco; Silva, Diego; Smith, Julia; Lee, Kelley",Global Health,157,22

The aim of this study was to examine the functional and morphological features of COVID-19-associated ARDS and to compare these with the characteristics of ARDS unrelated to COVID-19. METHODS: This prospective observational study was done at seven hospitals in Italy. We enrolled consecutive, mechanically ventilated patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and who met Berlin criteria for ARDS, who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between March 9 and March 22, 2020. All patients were sedated, paralysed, and ventilated in volume-control mode with standard ICU ventilators. Static respiratory system compliance, the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air, ventilatory ratio (a surrogate of dead space), and D-dimer concentrations were measured within 24 h of ICU admission. Lung CT scans and CT angiograms were done when clinically indicated. A dataset for ARDS unrelated to COVID-19 was created from previous ARDS studies. Survival to day 28 was assessed.

Median static compliance was 41 mL/cm H(2)O (33–52), which was 28% higher than in the cohort of patients with ARDS unrelated to COVID-19 (32 mL/cm H(2)O [25–43]; p<0·0001). 17 (6%) of 297 patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS had compliances greater than the 95th percentile of the classical ARDS cohort. Total lung weight did not differ between the two cohorts. CT pulmonary angiograms (obtained in 23 [8%] patients with COVID-19-related ARDS) showed that 15 (94%) of 16 patients with D-dimer concentrations greater than the median had bilateral areas of hypoperfusion, consistent with thromboembolic disease. Patients with D-dimer concentrations equal to or less than the median had ventilatory ratios lower than those of patients with D-dimer concentrations greater than the median (1·66 [1·32–1·95] vs 1·90 [1·50–2·33]; p=0·0001). Patients with static compliance equal to or less than the median and D-dimer concentrations greater than the median had markedly increased 28-day mortality compared with other patient subgroups (40 [56%] of 71 with high D-dimers and low compliance vs 18 [27%] of 67 with low D-dimers and high compliance, 13 [22%] of 60 with low D-dimers and low compliance, and 22 [35%] of 63 with high D-dimers and high compliance, all p=0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS have a form of injury that, in many aspects, is similar to that of those with ARDS unrelated to COVID-19. Notably, patients with COVID-19-related ARDS who have a reduction in respiratory system compliance together with increased D-dimer concentrations have high mortality rates.

Here, we describe the COVID-19 screening process of a residential addiction treatment center in rural Connecticut that has had no outbreaks, closures, or reductions in capacity since the pandemic began. Out of 420 patients screened for COVID-19 from 1 February to 1 July, five patients tested positive for COVID-19: four prior to entering its residential community setting, and one after entering the residential community, resulting in no COVID-19 spread to other patients. Patient 1 presented from home and tested positive during screening prior to entry into the community. The primary care provider for patient 2 notified staff of a recent pos-itive COVID-19 test prior to the patient’s arrival on-site. Patient 3 had a COVID-19 infection in the weeks prior to arrival and tested positive during initial screening. Patient 4 tested positive af-ter coming from another addiction treatment facility that was shut down due to a COVID-19 outbreak. Patient 5 tested negative for COVID-19 during initial screening, entered the residential community, and later tested positive. It is imperative that in-person support for SUD continues during the pandemic. This case report highlights the importance of implementing a variety of tools in an effective screening process, including polymerase chain reaction screening and daily symptomology and temperature screening, which may help prevent further closures or reductions in capacity of addiction treatment centers during the COVID-19 pandemic or future outbreaks.","Hanton, Kenneth; McHugh, Douglas; Boris, Gregory",Healthcare (Basel),157,21

In this paper we modelled and simulated a test-trace-and-quarantine strategy to control the COVID-19 outbreak in the State of Sao Paulo, Brasil. The State of Sao Paulo failed to adopt an effective social distancing strategy, reaching at most 59% in late March and started to relax the measures in late June, dropping to 41% in 08 August. Therefore, Sao Paulo relies heavily on a massive testing strategy in the attempt to control the epidemic. Two alternative strategies combined with economic evaluations were simulated. One strategy included indiscriminately testing the entire population of the State, reaching more than 40 million people at a maximum cost of 2.25 billion USD, that would reduce the total number of cases by the end of 2020 by 90%. The second strategy investigated testing only symptomatic cases and their immediate contacts - this strategy reached a maximum cost of 150 million USD but also reduced the number of cases by 90%. The conclusion is that if the State of Sao Paulo had decided to adopt the simulated strategy on April the 1st, it would have been possible to reduce the total number of cases by 90% at a cost of 2.25 billion US dollars for the indiscriminate strategy but at a much smaller cost of 125 million US dollars for the selective testing of symptomatic cases and their contacts.","Amaku, M.; Covas, D.

This auto-inflammatory disease mainly affects the lungs, the gateway to environmental aggressions and viral infections. We have shown previously that genetic predisposition to sarcoidosis occurring in familial cases is related to a large spectrum of pathogenic variants with, however, a clustering around mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin)-related pathways and autophagy regulation. The context of the COVID-19 pandemic led us to evaluate whether such genetic defects may increase the risk of a severe course of SARS-CoV2 infection in patients with sarcoidosis. We extended a whole exome screening to 13 families predisposed to sarcoidosis and crossed the genes sharing mutations with the list of genes involved in the SARS-CoV2 host-pathogen protein-protein interactome. A similar analysis protocol was applied to a series of 100 healthy individuals. Using ENRICH.R, a comprehensive gene set enrichment web server, we identified the functional pathways represented in the set of genes carrying deleterious mutations and confirmed the overrepresentation of autophagy- and mitophagy-related functions in familial cases of sarcoidosis. The same protocol was applied to the set of genes common to sarcoidosis and the SARS-CoV2-host interactome and found a significant enrichment of genes related to mitochondrial factors involved in autophagy, mitophagy, and RIG-I-like (Retinoic Acid Inducible Gene 1) Receptor antiviral response signaling. From these results, we discuss the hypothesis according to which sarcoidosis is a model for studying genetic abnormalities associated with host response to viral infections as a consequence of defects in autophagy and mitophagy processes.","Pacheco, Yves; Valeyre, Dominique; El Jammal, Thomas; Vallee, Maxime; Chevalier, Fabien; Lamartine, Jérôme; Sigaudo-Roussel, Dominique; Verrier, Bernard; Israel-Biet, Dominique; Freymond, Nathalie; Cottin, Vincent; Calender, Alain",Cells,157,28

This report aimed to assess the relationship between tobacco product-specific risk perceptions for COVID-19 and changes in tobacco use since the start of the pandemic. METHODS: A sample (n=776) of past-30 day exclusive smokers (n=238), exclusive e-cigarette users (n=143), and dual users (n=395) residing in the US and aged 18 or older was collected using Mechanical Turk from April 27 to June 8, 2020. Adjusted associations between tobacco product-specific COVID-19 risk perceptions (i.e. risk that smokers/vapers are at for COVID-19 relative to non-smokers/non-vapers) and changes in tobacco use since the pandemic began were assessed using partial proportional odds models. RESULTS: A majority of those who used cigarettes (63.7%) and e-cigarettes (56.1%) felt that the risk of COVID-19 was greater for users of their tobacco product than for non-users. Twenty-four percent of smokers had increased their cigarette use since the start of the pandemic and 28.0% had decreased. Similarly, 27.3% of e-cigarette users had increased their e-cigarette use since the start of the pandemic and 23.8% had decreased. Higher risk perceptions for COVID-19 were associated with reductions in tobacco use since the pandemic began for exclusive e-cigarette users and dual users. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide support that tobacco product-specific COVID-19 risk perceptions may be an important correlate of changes in tobacco use during the pandemic. Targeted information to inform tobacco users regarding their risks for COVID-19 is needed during this public health crisis.","White, Augustus M; Li, Dongmei; Snell, L Morgan; O’Connor, Richard; Hoetger, Cosima; Croft, Daniel; Lester, Rebecca C; McIntosh, Scott; Underwood, Megan; Schneller, Liane; Breland, Alison; Barnes, Andrew J; Cobb, Caroline O; Ossip, Deborah J",Nicotine Tob Res,157,16

In this study, the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was explored in primary-treated wastewater from two municipal wastewater treatment plants in Quintana Roo, Mexico, along with groundwater from sinkholes, a household well, and submarine groundwater discharges. Physicochemical variables were obtained in situ, and coliphage densities were determined. Three virus concentration methods based on adsorption-elution and sequential filtration were used followed by RNA isolation. Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 was done by RT-qPCR using the CDC 2020 assay, 2019-nCoV_N1 and 2019-nCoV_N2. The Pepper mild mottle virus, one of the most abundant RNA viruses in wastewater was quantified by RT-qPCR and compared to SARS-CoV-2 concentrations. The use of three combined virus concentration methods together with two qPCR assays allowed the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 58% of the wastewater samples analyzed, whereas none of the groundwater samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater were from 1.8 × 10(3) to 7.5 × 10(3) genome copies per liter (GC l(−1)), using the N1 RT-qPCR assay, and from 2.4 × 10(2) to 5.9 × 10(3) GC l(−1) using the N2 RT-qPCR assay. Based on PMMoV prevalence detected in all wastewater and groundwater samples tested, the three viral concentration methods used could be successfully applied for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in further studies. This study represents the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in southeast Mexico and provides a baseline for developing a wastewater-based epidemiology approach in the area.","Rosiles-González, Gabriela; Carrillo-Jovel, Victor Hugo; Alzate-Gaviria, Liliana; Betancourt, Walter Q.; Gerba, Charles P.; Moreno-Valenzuela, Oscar A.; Tapia-Tussell, Raúl; Hernández-Zepeda, Cecilia",Food Environ Virol,157,1

Therefore, the aim of the review is to collect and discuss aspects of the management of patients in oral and maxillofacial surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to save resources and to avoid unnecessary exposure to infected patients, there is the need to schedule interventions depending on their priority. During the peak of the pandemic, no elective surgery should be performed. Even urgent procedures might be postponed if there is a view to recovery of a COVID-19 patient within a few days. Emergency procedures do not allow any delay. Specialties with overlap in therapies should have well defined arrangements among each other concerning the treatment spectra in order to avoid redundancy and loss of resources. Inpatient and outpatient units have to be organized in such a way that the risk of cross-infection among patients is reduced to a minimum. Especially, testing of patients for SARS-CoV-2 is important to detect the infected patients at an early stage. When surgery is performed on COVID-19 patients, adequate personal protective equipment is crucial. There must be negative pressure in the operating room, and aerosol formation must be reduced to a minimum. In order to address the COVID-19 challenge adequately, significant changes in the infrastructure of outpatient units, inpatient units, and operating rooms are needed. In addition, the demands concerning personal protective equipment increase significantly. The major aim is to protect patients as well as the medical staff from unnecessary infection, and to keep the healthcare system running effectively. Therefore, every effort should be taken to make the necessary investments.","Zimmermann, Matthias; Nkenke, Emeka",J Craniomaxillofac Surg,157,24

Previous work has shown that rates of Black and White mortality have converged over time. Understanding of COVID-19 disparities over time is complicated by geographic changes in prevalence, and some prior research has claimed that regional shifts in COVID-19 prevalence may explain the convergence. METHODS: Using county-level COVID-19 mortality data stratified by race, we investigate the trajectory of Black and White per capita mortality from June 2020–January 2021. We use a county fixed-effects model to estimate changes within counties, then extend our models to leverage county-level variation in prevalence to study the effects of prevalence versus time trajectories in mortality disparities. FINDINGS: Over this period, cumulative mortality rose by 61% and 90% for Black and White populations respectively, decreasing the mortality ratio by 0.4 (25.8%). These trends persisted when a county-level fixed-effects model was applied. Results revealed that county-level changes in prevalence nearly fully explain changes in mortality disparities over time. INTERPRETATION: Results suggest mechanisms underpinning convergence in Black/White mortality are not driven by fixed county-level characteristics or changes in the regional dispersion of COVID-19, but instead by changes within counties. Further, declines in the Black/White mortality ratio over time appear primarily linked to county-level changes in COVID-19 prevalence rather than other county-level factors that may vary with time. Research into COVID-19 disparities should focus on mechanisms that operate within-counties and are consistent with a prevalence-disparity relationship.

METHODS: 105 COVID‐19 patients were enrolled as the disease group. 197 non‐COVID‐19 patients served as the control group. Magnetic chemiluminescent immunoassay (MCLIA) was used to detect the IgM and IgG. RESULTS: The peak of positive rates of SARS‐CoV‐2 IgM was about 1 week earlier than that of IgG. It reached to peak within 15–21 days and then began a slowly decline. The positive rates of IgG were increased with the disease course and reached the peak between 22 and 39 days. The differences in sensitivity of the three detection modes (IgM, IgG, and IgM + IgG) were statistically significant. The largest group of test cases (illness onset 15–21 days) showed that the positive rate of IgG was higher than IgM. Also, the sensitivity of IgM combined with IgG was higher than IgM or IgG. IgM and IgG were monitored dynamically for 16 patients with COVID‐19, the results showed that serological transformation of IgM was carried out simultaneously with IgG in seven patients, which was earlier than IgG in four patients and later than IgG in five patients. CONCLUSION: The detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 IgM and IgG is very important to determine the course of COVID‐19.

The BDV glycoprotein (G) is an extensively glycosylated protein that migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 84,000 to 94,000 kilodaltons (kDa). BDV G is post-translationally cleaved by the cellular subtilisin-like protease furin into two subunits, a 41 kDa amino terminal protein GP1 and a 43 kDa carboxyl terminal protein GP2. RESULTS: Class III viral fusion proteins (VFP) encoded by members of the Rhabdoviridae, Herpesviridae and Baculoviridae have an internal fusion domain comprised of beta sheets, other beta sheet domains, an extended alpha helical domain, a membrane proximal stem domain and a carboxyl terminal anchor. Proteomics computational analyses suggest that the structural/functional motifs that characterize class III VFP are located collinearly in BDV G. Structural models were established for BDV G based on the post-fusion structure of a prototypic class III VFP, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G).

Understanding the proportion of the population at risk of severe infection, including among those with heart disease, could assist current vaccine strategy efforts. METHODS: Using data from the 2015-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we estimated the weighted prevalence of any of eight of eleven increased-risk conditions (including age ≥65) in U.S. adults aged ≥18 (N=10,581) and extrapolated these results to a population of 233.8 million U.S. adults ≥18, and subgroups from the overall population defined by race/ethnicity, education, income and history of heart disease. RESULTS: An estimated 176.1 million individuals representing 75.4% of U.S. adults had at least one increased-risk condition, 40.3% ≥2 and, 18.5% ≥3 conditions. Approximately 129 million adults aged <65 (69.2%) were also estimated to be at increased-risk. Compared to Whites, similar proportions of Blacks in the overall population (78.0 vs. 75.6%, p>0.05) and Hispanics in the younger population (70.8 vs 68.4%) were estimated to be at increased-risk. Conversely, a greater proportion of individuals with lower education and income levels were estimated to be at increased-risk both in the overall and younger population. In addition, an estimated 6.2 million individuals (14.5%) had heart disease. Among these, virtually all had at least one additional CDC risk factor (97.9%) and most had ≥2 or ≥3 risk factors (83.8% and 58.5%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: As vaccination strategies are being explored, these results demonstrate that >75% of adults in the U.S. would be considered at increased-risk for severe COVID-19 infection by CDC criteria. Risk factor prevalence alone may not adequately capture the totality of risk, particularly among Black and Hispanic racial/ethnic groups and those with heart disease.","Ajufo, Ezimamaka; Rao, Shreya; Navar, Ann Marie; Pandey, Ambarish; Ayers, Colby R.; Khera, Amit",Am J Prev Cardiol,157,30

Recognizing the importance of the social determinants of health (SDOH), different actors in the health care, public health, and social service sectors are increasingly collaborating to improve health outcomes in communities. To support such collaboration, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation developed a cross-sector alignment theory of change. According to the cross-sector alignment theory of change, community voice is critical for helping collaboratives address community health needs. Yet research on health collaboratives offers mixed guidance on how community voice should be understood and which community voice strategies are most effective. METHODS: This study addresses a gap in the literature with a systematic scoping review of research on health-oriented cross-sector collaboration and community voice. By scanning key academic journals, searching three academic databases, and obtaining documents from across our professional networks, we identified 36 documents that address community voice in health collaboratives. RESULTS: The review reveals several conceptions of community voice and a range of community voice strategies. We find that community voice strategies fall on a spectrum between two broad types of approaches: active and passive. These vary not only in the level of power shared between communities and collaborators, but also in the level of involvement required from the community, and this in turn has important implications for community collaboration strategies. We also find that while most strategies are discussed in the context of short-term collaboration, many also lend themselves to adoption in the context of sustainable collaboration and, ultimately, cross-sector alignment. CONCLUSION: This review provides a characterization and conceptualization of community voice in health-oriented collaborations that provides a new theoretical basis for future research. Passive and active community voice strategies can be studied in more detail for their expected impact on health outcomes and disparities. Increased attention to active community voice and the resources it requires can help practitioners achieve improved health outcomes and researchers understand the pathways to health improvement through collaboration.","Petiwala, Aliza; Lanford, Daniel; Landers, Glenn; Minyard, Karen",BMC Public Health,157,26

There are many reports about the relationship between COVID-19 and facial paralysis but there is no prospective study. SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies increase in COVID-19. Our purpose is to investigate SARS-CoV-2 IgG + IgM antibody in the Bell's palsy. METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study was planned. Patients with acute peripheral facial paralysis with no reason and diagnosed as Bell's palsy was included in the study. In order to investigate SARS-CoV-2 in the etiologies of these patients, SARS-CoV-2 IgM + IgG (total) test was studied. SARS-CoV-2 IgG + IgM was measured by using the ADVIA Centaur® test kit. Test reports result in index values and as nonreactive or reactive. The results were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were included in the study. The average age of the patients was 41,7. 17 (41,4%) were female and 24 (58,6%) were male. 21 patients had left-sided; 20 had right-sided paralysis. SARS-CoV-2 IgG + IgM values were measured two times of the patients. First control was in the first week of facial paralysis, 10 (24,3%) positivity was found. The average index of the positive patients were 6,74 (min.1,39–max.10) in the first control and 9,585 in the second control (min.8,7–max. 10). CONCLUSION: We found that the SARS-CoV-2 IgM + IgG antibody test was positive in 24.3% of the patients with Bell's palsy. The results are higher than the seroprevalence studies conducted in asymptomatic individuals. Facial paralysis could be the only symptom of COVID-19 but further studies must be done.","Islamoglu, Yuce; Celik, Burak; Kiris, Muzaffer",Am J Otolaryngol,157,32

We identified that 1) drug potency is slightly higher in nasal passages than in lungs, 2) viral load decrease in lungs relative to nasal passages during therapy because of infection-dependent generation of refractory cells in the lung, 3) incomplete drug potency in the lung that decreases viral loads even slightly may allow substantially less lung damage, and 4) increases in nasal viral load may occur due to a slight blunting of peak viral load and subsequent decrease of the intensity of the innate immune response, as well as a lack of refractory cells. We also hypothesize that direct inoculation of the trachea in rhesus macaques may not recapitulate natural infection as lung damage occurs more abruptly in this model than in human infection. We demonstrate with sensitivity analysis that a drug with higher potency could completely suppress viral replication and lower viral loads abruptly in the nasal passages as well as the lung. One Sentence Summary We developed a mathematical model to explain why remdesivir has a greater antiviral effect on SARS CoV-2 in lung versus nasal passages in rhesus macaques.","Goyal, Ashish; Duke, Elizabeth R.; Cardozo-Ojeda, E.

There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19, and many vaccine candidates are currently under clinical trials. This study aimed to understand the perception of social media users regarding a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria. METHODS: we conducted a cross-sectional survey among social media users in Nigeria in August 2020 using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire includes sections on the demographic characteristics of the respondents and their perception regarding a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 517 respondents completed and returned the informed consent along with the questionnaire electronically. Data were coded and abstracted into Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and loaded into the STATA 14 software for final analysis. RESULTS: the results showed that more than half of the respondents were male 294 (56.9%). Most of the respondents 385 (74.5%) intend to take the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Among the 132 respondents that would not take the COVID-19 vaccine, the major reason for non-acceptance was unreliability of the clinical trials 49 (37.1%), followed by the belief that their immune system is sufficient to combat the virus 36 (27.3%). We found a significant association between the age of the respondents and the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (P-value=0.00) as well as geographical location and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (P-value=0.02). CONCLUSION: it was observed that most of the respondents were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Our findings also reiterate the need to reassure the public the benefits an effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine can reap for public health. There is a need for national health authorities in Nigeria to ensure public trust is earned and all communities, including the marginalized populations, are properly engaged to ensure an optimal COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.","Adebisi, Yusuff Adebayo; Alaran, Aishat Jumoke; Bolarinwa, Obasanjo Afolabi; Akande-Sholabi, Wuraola; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo",Pan Afr Med J,157,31

We evaluate the performance of tracking-based intervention methods on a network SEIR model, which we augment with an additional parameter to model pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and study the effectiveness of these methods in combination with or as an alternative to quarantine and global lockdown policies. Our focus is on the basic trade-off between human-lives lost and economic costs, and on how this trade-off changes under different quarantine, lockdown, tracking, and testing policies. Our main findings are as follows: (1) Tests combined with patient quarantines reduce both economic costs and mortality, however, an extensive-scale testing capacity is required to achieve a significant improvement. (2) Tracking significantly reduces both economic costs and mortality. (3) Tracking combined with a moderate testing capacity can achieve containment without lockdowns. (4) In the presence of a flow of new incoming infections, dynamic “On–Off” lockdowns are more efficient than fixed lockdowns. In this setting as well, tracking strictly improves efficiency. The results show the extreme usefulness of policies that combine tracking and testing for reducing mortality and economic costs, and their potential to contain outbreaks without imposing any social distancing restrictions. This highlights the difficult social question of trading-off these gains against patient privacy, which is inevitably infringed by tracking.","Kolumbus, Yoav; Nisan, Noam",Sci Rep,157,28

COVID-19 has put an unexpected and inordinate degree of pressure on healthcare systems of strong and fragile countries alike. To launch both containment and mitigation measures, each country requires estimates of COVID-19 incidence as such preparedness allows agencies to plan efficient resource allocation and to design control strategies. Here, we have developed a new adaptive, interacting, and cluster-based mathematical model to predict the granular trajectory of COVID-19. We have analyzed incidence data from three currently afflicted countries of Italy, the United States of America, and India. We show that our approach predicts state-wise COVID-19 spread for each country with reasonable accuracy. We show that R(t,) as the effective reproduction number, exhibits significant spatial variations in these countries. However, by accounting for the spatial variation of R(t) in an adaptive fashion, the predictive model provides estimates of the possible asymptomatic and undetected COVID-19 cases, both of which are key contributors in COVID-19 transmission. We have applied our methodology to make detailed predictions for COVID19 incidences at the district and state level in India. Finally, to make the models available to the public at large, we have developed a web-based dashboard, namely “Predictions and Assessment of Corona Infections and Transmission in India” (PRACRITI, see http://pracriti.iitd.ac.in), which provides the detailed R(t) values and a three-week forecast of COVID cases.","Ravinder, R.; Singh, Sourabh; Bishnoi, Suresh; Jan, Amreen; Sharma, Amit; Kodamana, Hariprasad; Krishnan, N.M.

In vitro systems developed so far have limited the growth in knowledge about RCVs by not permitting generation of plaque-cloned virus stocks, reliable isolation of RCVs from rat tissues, or growth of high titered stocks of all isolates. Due to the fact that less than 20% of L2(Percy) cells were becoming infected, sublines were produced and selected for maximal growth of RCVs. Screening of 238 cell sublines yielded L2p.176 cells which were highly susceptible to all RCVs tested; however, susceptibility declined after 30 passages in vitro. Low-passaged L2p.176 cells were used to isolate virus from natural outbreaks and to propagate individual RCV plaques into high titered stocks. Proteins from six RCV isolates were immunoblotted using polyclonal rat and mouse antibodies to sialodacryoadenitis virus and polyclonal monospecific rabbit and goat antibodies against the peplomer (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Proteins of two prototype, one Japanese and three wild type RCVs were examined and found to be similar to those of MHV, although the exact sizes and ratios of protein forms were unique for most RCV isolats. This study reports the development of a continuous cell line which reliably supports RCVs opening an opportunity for further in vivo studies of the biology of these agents. As a first step in the characterization of RCVs, we have shown that RCV proteins are very similar to those of MHV.","Gaertner, Diane J.; Compton, Susan R.; Winograd, Deborah F.; Smith, Abigail L.",Virus Research,157,18

This overlooks individuals initially unresponsive to obesity interventions. Staged pediatric clinical treatment guidelines were adapted to the school setting to develop an escalated treatment option for individuals initially unresponsive. This staged randomized controlled trial examined differences between escalated treatment (Take CHARGE!) and a maintenance program (PE Planners). Take CHARGE was hypothesized to have greater improvements in BMI as a percentage of the 95th BMI Percentile (%BMIp95) than PE Planners. SUBJECTS/METHODS: From 2018 to 2020, 171 middle and high schoolers (BMI Percentile ≥ 85) were recruited from a Houston school district to participate in a staged obesity intervention in their physical education (PE) class. After receiving a semester-long intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) with established efficacy, all participants were randomized to Take CHARGE (n = 85) or PE Planners (n = 86). Take CHARGE escalated the behavioral treatment of obesity received in ILI with more frequent individual sessions, additional opportunities for parental and school staff involvement, and increased mentorship from trained college students. PE Planners allowed participants to decide how they wanted to be active in PE class. Mixed linear modeling examined %BMIp95 overtime between groups. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT04362280). RESULTS: Participants were 13.63 ± 1.32 years old; 59% were female, and 85% were Hispanic. Among those initially unresponsive to ILI, Take CHARGE had significantly greater decreases in %BMIp95 than PE Planners (β = −0.01, p < 0.01). Conversely, among those initially responsive, Take CHARGE had significantly smaller decreases in %BMIp95 than PE Planners (β = 0.02, p < 0.05). Intention-to-treat analysis had similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Participant outcomes in semester two differed based on initial response. Individuals responsive to initial intervention were most likely to benefit from a maintenance intervention and those initially unresponsive benefited more from escalated treatment. This indicates the need for staged intervention protocols to better address obesity in the school setting.","Arlinghaus, Katherine R.; O’Connor, Daniel P.; Ledoux, Tracey A.; Hughes, Sheryl O.; Johnston, Craig A.",Int J Obes (Lond),157,20

One hundred and forty‐eight ([Landrace × Yorkshire] × Duroc) piglets, weaned at age day 21, were randomly assigned to receive one of three diets for 14 days. Treatment group one (control group) was fed the base diet. Treatment group two (antibiotics group) was fed the base diet which was supplemented with 100 ppm colistin sulphate and 15 ppm enramycin; treatment group three (IgY group) was fed the base diet which was supplemented with 500 mg/kg anti‐E. coli IgY. The study evaluated the effects on EWPs of IgY on growth, serum biochemical, inflammatory profiles and also digestion content intestinal bacterial populations. Results showed no significant difference in diarrhoea rates between IgY‐fed EWPs and antibiotic‐treated EWPs. Serum biochemical analysis showed that EWPs fed an IgY‐containing diet had both lower (p < 0.05) cholesterol and low‐density lipoprotein compared to antibiotic‐treated EWPs. Escherichia coli populations measured in IgY‐fed EWP ileal contents, compared to the control group, were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Clostridium and Bifidobacterium populations were unaffected by the IgY treatment. Larger (p < 0.05) Enterococcus populations and lower (p < 0.05) expression levels of heat‐stable enterotoxin b (STb) were observed in IgY‐fed EWP caecal digesta compared to the control group. Enteric Lactobacillus significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in EWPs fed antibiotics while it was unaffected by IgY treatment. Dietary supplementation with anti‐E. coli IgY has the potential to suppress enteric E. coli growth, but not Lactobacillus, Clostridium and Bifidobacterium. This promotes and maintains a healthy EWP intestinal environment. These findings suggest that IgY may be used as an alternative to antibiotics in EWP diets.","Tan, Xian; Li, Jia; Li, Yali; Li, Jianzhong; Wang, Qingping; Fang, Lin; Ding, Xueqin; Huang, Pengfei; Yang, Huansheng; Yin, Yulong",J Anim Physiol Anim Nutr (Berl),157,20

We aimed to study excess deaths (all death causes, but also COVID-19-related deaths) during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding age, socio-economic status, the situation in nursing homes, and place of death for nursing home residents. DESIGN: We performed a descriptive regional registry data study using VAL, the Stockholm Regional Council’s central data warehouse, which covers almost all health care use in the county of Stockholm. T tests and chi-square tests were used for comparisons. RESULTS: Compared with 2016–2019, there were excess deaths in March–May 2020 (p < 0.0001), mainly explained by COVID-19, but in April there were also unexplained excess deaths. Individuals dying from COVID-19 were older than patients dying from other causes (p < 0.0001). There were more patient deaths among people residing in less advantaged socio-economic areas (p < 0.0001). Nursing home residents dying from COVID-19 were more often admitted to acute hospitals than residents dying from other causes (p < 0.0001). Also, the proportion of admissions of nursing home residents dying from other causes increased from April to May 2020 (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Dying from COVID-19 mainly affects the elderly, nursing home residents, and persons from less advantaged socio-economic groups.

Although there is a limited evidence to confirm the orchitis and virus presence in the semen of patients, there are concerns about the transmission of virus through the semen. In addition, reduced fertility or infertility can be seen as consequences of severe COVID-19 in recovered subjects. In this study, we aimed to review articles related to COVID-19 and male reproductive system to find the possible underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 in affecting male fertility. The following keywords of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, testis, orchitis, semen, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), hypothalamic–pituitary–testicular (HPT) axis, Hypothalamus, etc., were defined to find the related publications from standard search engines, e.g., PUBMED, SCOPUS, Google Scholar. According to studies, COVID-19 occurs in severe patients as respiratory disease, along with multi-organ failure. The most important mechanisms are classified as direct and indirect pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. The presence of ACE2 on the cell surface of various cells in testis increases the risk of direct infection by this virus. SARS-CoV-2 also affects the testis through the cytokine storm. In addition, the important role of HPT axis dysregulation through impaired Leydig cells and hypothalamus should be considered. Using antiviral and immunomodulatory therapy can be harmful for testis function. Further investigations are required to investigate potential mechanisms of male infertility in survivals of COVID-19. Since involvement of testis is essential for fertility, increasing the knowledge of health system may improve the outcomes.","Ardestani Zadeh, Arash; Arab, Davood",J Mol Histol,157,16

The risks of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are anticipated to be very low, and we strongly support SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with IBD. Based on data from previous studies with other vaccines, there are conceptual concerns that protective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may be diminished in some patients with IBD, such as those taking anti-TNF drugs. However, the benefits of vaccination, even in patients treated with anti-TNF drugs, are likely to outweigh these theoretical concerns. Key areas for further research are discussed, including vaccine hesitancy and its effect in the IBD community, the effect of immunosuppression on vaccine efficacy, and the search for predictive biomarkers of vaccine success.","Alexander, James L; Moran, Gordon W; Gaya, Daniel R; Raine, Tim; Hart, Ailsa; Kennedy, Nicholas A; Lindsay, James O; MacDonald, Jonathan; Segal, Jonathan P; Sebastian, Shaji; Selinger, Christian P; Parkes, Miles; Smith, Philip J; Dhar, Anjan; Subramanian, Sreedhar; Arasaradnam, Ramesh; Lamb, Christopher A; Ahmad, Tariq; Lees, Charlie W; Dobson, Liz; Wakeman, Ruth; Iqbal, Tariq H; Arnott, Ian; Powell, Nick",Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol,157,27

Systematic support is needed to prepare nursing apprentices for the high demands of their profession and to reduce the number of nurses who finally quit. Particularly in stressful jobs like nursing, humor as a coping strategy can have a beneficial effect on perceived stress and overall work enjoyment. In this study, we used a humor intervention among nursing staff in training and evaluated its effects on humor, stress, work enjoyment, the meaningfulness of work, and flow experience. The sample consists of 104 nurses in training. The intervention group received a 3-h humor intervention, while the control group received no intervention. Positive and negative affect were measured immediately before and after the intervention. Humor was measured before the intervention (t(0)) and again 6 months later (t(1)); at t(1), we again measured humor and also stress, work meaningfulness, work enjoyment, and flow experience. Our analyses showed a beneficial change in positive and negative affect right after the intervention. By means of repeated measures ANOVA we could further confirm an effect of the intervention on reported humor 6 months later. Humor mediated positive effects of the humor intervention on perceived meaningfulness of work, work enjoyment, and on the frequency of flow at work. Also, we found a significant negative relationship between humor and stress measured at t(1). The results of this study confirm the effectiveness of humor interventions in promoting humor, and, through this, the meaningfulness of work, work enjoyment, and the frequency of flow experience.

Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 VOCs such as B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa), P.1 (Brazil), and B.1.617.1 (India) now dominate the pandemic. Herein, we found that binding activity and neutralizing capacity of sera collected from convalescent patients in early 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, but not non-VOC variants, were severely blunted. Furthermore, we observed evasion of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs from a VH3-30 mAb 32D4, which was proved to exhibit highly potential neutralization against wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2. Thus, these results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 VOCs might be able to spread in convalescent patients and even harbor resistance to medical countermeasures. New interventions against these SARS-CoV-2 VOCs are urgently needed.","Yue, Shuai; Li, Zhirong; Lin, Yao; Yang, Yang; Yuan, Mengqi; Pan, Zhiwei; Hu, Li; Gao, Leiqiong; Zhou, Jing; Tang, Jianfang; Wang, Yifei; Tian, Qin; Hao, Yaxing; Wang, Juan; Huang, Qizhao; Xu, Lifan; Zhu, Bo; Liu, Pinghuang; Deng, Kai; Wang, Li; Ye, Lilin; Chen, Xiangyu",Front Immunol,157,3

This is not a universal sarbecovirus trait; for example, many known sarbecoviruses related to SARS-CoV-1 have two deletions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein that render them incapable of using human ACE2. Here, we report three novel sarbecoviruses from Rwanda and Uganda which are phylogenetically intermediate to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate via in vitro studies that they are also unable to utilize human ACE2. Furthermore, we show that the observed pattern of ACE2 usage among sarbecoviruses is most likely due to recombination. We show that the lineage that includes SARS-CoV-2 is most likely the ancestral ACE2-using lineage, and that recombination with at least one virus from this group conferred ACE2 usage to the progenitor of SARS-CoV-1 at some time in the past. We argue that alternative scenarios such as convergent evolution are much less parsimonious; we show that biogeography and patterns of host tropism support the plausibility of a recombination scenario; and we propose a competitive release hypothesis to explain how this recombination event could have occurred and why it is evolutionarily advantageous. The findings provide important insights into the natural history of ACE2 usage for both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and a greater understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that shape zoonotic potential of coronaviruses. This study also underscores the need for increased surveillance for sarbecoviruses in southwestern China, where most ACE2-using viruses have been found to date, as well as other regions including Africa, where these viruses have only recently been discovered.","Wells, H.L; Letko, M; Lasso, G; Ssebide, B; Nziza, J; Byarugaba, D.K; Navarrete-Macias, I; Liang, E; Cranfield, M; Han, B.A; Tingley, M.W; Diuk-Wasser, M; Goldstein, T; Johnson, C.K; Mazet, J; Chandran, K; Munster, V.J; Gilardi, K; Anthony, S.J",bioRxiv,157,16

Children with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) may have tuberculosis, other respiratory tract infections or co-infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other pathogens. We aimed to identify the presence of potential respiratory pathogens in nasopharyngeal (NP) samples from children with suspected PTB. METHOD: NP samples collected from consecutive children presenting with suspected PTB at Red Cross Children’s Hospital (Cape Town, South Africa) were tested by multiplex real-time RT-PCR. Mycobacterial liquid culture and Xpert MTB/RIF was performed on 2 induced sputa obtained from each participant. Children were categorised as definite-TB (culture or qPCR [Xpert MTB/RIF] confirmed), unlikely-TB (improvement of symptoms without TB treatment on follow-up) and unconfirmed-TB (all other children). RESULTS: Amongst 214 children with a median age of 36 months (interquartile range, [IQR] 19–66 months), 34 (16 %) had definite-TB, 86 (40 %) had unconfirmed-TB and 94 (44 %) were classified as unlikely-TB. Moraxella catarrhalis (64 %), Streptococcus pneumoniae (42 %), Haemophilus influenzae spp (29 %) and Staphylococcus aureus (22 %) were the most common bacteria detected in NP samples. Other bacteria detected included Mycoplasma pneumoniae (9 %), Bordetella pertussis (7 %) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (4 %). The most common viruses detected included metapneumovirus (19 %), rhinovirus (15 %), influenza virus C (9 %), adenovirus (7 %), cytomegalovirus (7 %) and coronavirus O43 (5.6 %). Both bacteria and viruses were detected in 73, 55 and 56 % of the definite, unconfirmed and unlikely-TB groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in the distribution of respiratory microbes between children with and without TB. Using quadratic discriminant analysis, human metapneumovirus, C. pneumoniae, coronavirus 043, influenza virus C virus, rhinovirus and cytomegalovirus best discriminated children with definite-TB from the other groups of children. CONCLUSIONS: A broad range of potential respiratory pathogens was detected in children with suspected TB. There was no clear association between TB categorisation and detection of a specific pathogen. Further work is needed to explore potential pathogen interactions and their role in the pathogenesis of PTB.

We also developed practical recommendations in order to ensure adequate quality standards and safety advice for HVRs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar was performed, and results were included up to July 2020. All studies concerning the use of HVRs as a diagnostic tool for patients presenting PSLE were included. RESULTS: Seventeen studies satisfied all inclusion and exclusion criteria and were considered for the review. A consistent boost in diagnostic and clinical decision-making was reported across all studies in the literature. One study found that HVRs decreased the stress level in many families and improved their quality of life. Training in performing good-quality videos is necessary and increases the diagnostic value of HVRs. CONCLUSIONS: HVRs can be of diagnostic value in epilepsy diagnosis and management. HVRs are low cost, widespread, and may provide great support for neurologists. It is important to train patients and caregivers in performing good quality videos to optimize this useful tool and to guarantee safety standards during the recording.

METHODS: We undertook a single-centre, retrospective cohort study examining COVID-19-related mortality using electronic health records, for older people (65 and over) with frailty, hospitalised with or without COVID-19 infection. Baseline covariates included demographics, early warning scores, Charlson Comorbidity Indices and frailty (Clinical Frailty Scale, CFS), linked to COVID-19 status. FINDINGS: We analysed outcomes on 1,071 patients with COVID-19 test results (285 (27%) were positive for COVID-19). The mean age at ED arrival was 79.7 and 49.4% were female. All-cause mortality (by 30 days) rose from 9 (not frail) to 33% (severely frail) in the COVID-negative cohort but was around 60% for all frailty categories in the COVID-positive cohort. In adjusted analyses, the hazard ratio for death in those with COVID-19 compared to those without COVID-19 was 7.3 (95% CI: 3.00, 18.0) with age, comorbidities and illness severity making small additional contributions. INTERPRETATION: In this study, frailty measured using the CFS appeared to make little incremental contribution to the hazard of dying in older people hospitalised with COVID-19 infection; illness severity and comorbidity had a modest association with the overall adjusted hazard of death, whereas confirmed COVID-19 infection dominated, with a sevenfold hazard for death.","Owen, Rhiannon K; Conroy, Simon P; Taub, Nicholas; Jones, Will; Bryden, Daniele; Pareek, Manish; Faull, Christina; Abrams, Keith R; Davis, Daniel; Banerjee, Jay",Age Ageing,157,24

The airway epithelium has an important role in host defense against infection and this is illustrated in this review by considering infection by respiratory viruses. In patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory viruses are a common trigger of exacerbations. Rhinoviruses (RV) are the most common virus type detected. Knowledge of the immunopathogenesis of such RV‐induced exacerbations remains limited, but information is available from in vitro and from in vivo studies, especially of experimental infection in human volunteers. RV infects and replicates within epithelial cells (EC) of the lower respiratory tract. EC are an important component of the innate‐immune response to RV infection. The interaction between virus and the intracellular signaling pathways of the host cell results in activation of potentially antiviral mechanisms, including type 1 interferons and nitric oxide, and in the producton of cytokines and chemokines [interleukin (IL)‐1β, IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐11, IL‐16, tumor necrosis factor α, granulocyte macrophage‐colony stimulating factor, growth‐regulated oncogene‐α, epithelial neutrophil‐activating protein‐78, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted, eotaxin 1/2, macrophage‐inflammatory protein‐1α], which influence the subsequent induced innate‐ and specific‐immune response. Although this is beneficial in facilitating clearance of virus from the respiratory tract, the generation of proinflammatory mediators and the recruitment of inflammatory cells result in a degree of immunopathology and may amplify pre‐existing airway inflammation. Further research will be necessary to determine whether modification of EC responses to respiratory virus infection will be of therapeutic benefit.","Message, Simon D.; Johnston, Sebastian L.",J Leukoc Biol,157,1

Despite extensive knowledge of AIV in Asian LAMs, little is known about the prevalence South American LAMs. To fill this gap in knowledge, active surveillance was carried out at the major LAM in Medellin, Colombia between February and September 2015. During this period, overall prevalence in the market was 2.67% and a North American origin H11N2 AIV most similar to a virus isolated from Chilean shorebirds asymptomatically spread through multiple bird species in the market resulting in 17.0% positivity at peak of infection. Phenotypically, the H11 viruses displayed no known molecular markers associated with increased virulence in birds or mammals, had α2,3-sialic acid binding preference, and caused minimal replication in vitro and little morbidity in vivo. However, the Colombian H11N2 virus replicated and transmitted effectively in chickens explaining the spread throughout the market. Genetic similarity to H11 viruses isolated from North and South American shorebirds suggest that the LAM occurrence may have resulted from a wild bird to domestic poultry spillover event. The ability to spread in domestic poultry as well as potential for human infection by H11 viruses highlight the need for enhanced AIV surveillance in South America in both avian species and humans.","Jiménez-Bluhm, Pedro; Karlsson, Erik A; Ciuoderis, Karl A; Cortez, Valerie; Marvin, Shauna A; Hamilton-West, Christopher; Schultz-Cherry, Stacey; Osorio, Jorge E",Emerg Microbes Infect,157,6

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective, observational, cohort study included patients with COVID-19 symptoms presenting to the emergency department over a two-month period. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and the data of all-cause mortality within 30 days after admission were noted, and the Rapid Emergency Medicine Score and the Rapid Acute Physiology Score were calculated by the researchers. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the discriminative ability of the scores. RESULTS: A total of 555 patients with a mean of age of 49.4 ± 16.8 years were included in the study. The rate of 30-day mortality was 3.9% for the whole study cohort, 7.2% for the patients with a positive rt-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2, and 1.2% for those with a negative rt-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2. In the group of patients with COVID-19 symptoms, according to the best Youden's index, the cut-off value for the Rapid Emergency Medicine Score was determined as 3.5 (sensitivity: 81.82%, specificity: 73.08%), and the area under curve (AUC) value was 0.840 (95% confidence interval 0.768–0.913).

It is more difficult to evaluate VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection than against symptomatic COVID-19 because infection is not observed directly but rather is known to occur between two antibody or RT-PCR tests. Additional challenges arise as community transmission changes over time and as participants are vaccinated on different dates because of staggered enrollment or crossover before the end of the study. Here, we provide valid and efficient statistical methods for estimating potentially waning VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection with blood or nasal samples under time-varying community transmission, staggered enrollment, and blinded or unblinded crossover.

The current tests are based on spike (S), the receptor binding domain (RBD), or the nucleoprotein (NP) as substrate. Here, we used samples from a high seroprevalence cohort of health care workers (HCWs) to perform a longitudinal analysis of the antibody responses using three distinct serological assays. 501 serum samples were tested using: a) a research-grade RBD and spike based tandem enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MS-RBD ELISA, MS-spike ELISA), b) a commercial RBD and spike based tandem ELISA (Kantaro-RBD, -spike), and c) a commercial NP-based chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA, Abbott Architect). Seroprevalence ranged around 28% during the early stage of the pandemic (a: 28.4% positives; b: 28.1%; c: 27.3%). Good correlation was observed between the MS and Kantaro RBD ELISAs and between the MS and Kantaro spike ELISAs. By contrast, modest correlations were observed between the Abbott Architect and both RBD and spike-based assays. A proportion of HCWs (n=178) were sampled again 3-5 months after the first time point. Although antibody levels declined in most of the positive individuals, the overall seroprevalence measured by RBD-spike based assays remained unchanged. However the seroprevalence of NP-reactive antibodies significantly declined. Lastly, we tested six samples of individuals who received two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine and found that seroconversion was detected by the RBD-spike assays but, of course as expected, not the NP based assay.

SARS-CoV-2 attaches to human host cells through interaction of its receptor binding domain (RBD) located on the viral Spike (S) glycoprotein with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) on the surface of host cells. RBD binding to ACE2 is a critical first step in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral attachment occurs in dynamic environments where forces act on the binding partners and multivalent interactions play central roles, creating an urgent need for assays that can quantitate SARS-CoV-2 interactions with ACE2 under mechanical load and in defined geometries. Here, we introduce a tethered ligand assay that comprises the RBD and the ACE2 ectodomain joined by a flexible peptide linker. Using specific molecular handles, we tether the fusion proteins between a functionalized flow cell surface and magnetic beads in magnetic tweezers. We observe repeated interactions of RBD and ACE2 under constant loads and can fully quantify the force dependence and kinetics of the binding interaction. Our results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 interaction has higher mechanical stability, a larger free energy of binding, and a lower off-rate than that of SARS-CoV-1, the causative agents of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. In the absence of force, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD rapidly (within ≤1 ms) engages the ACE2 receptor if held in close proximity and remains bound to ACE2 for 400-800 s, much longer than what has been reported for other viruses engaging their cellular receptors. We anticipate that our assay will be a powerful tool investigate the roles of mutations in the RBD that might alter the infectivity of the virus and to test the modes of action of neutralizing antibodies and other agents designed to block RBD binding to ACE2 that are currently developed as potential COVID-19 therapeutics.","Bauer, Magnus S.; Gruber, Sophia; Milles, Lukas F.; Nicolaus, Thomas; Schendel, Leonard C.; Gaub, Hermann E.; Lipfert, Jan",bioRxiv,157,22

Cardiovascular shock and markedly raised inflammatory markers are prominent features, while significant hypoxia is uncommon. Patients respond well to corticosteroid therapy, but failure of clinicians to recognise this recently identified phenomenon, which can mimic common conditions including sepsis, could delay diagnosis and treatment.

OBJECTIVE: This analysis was carried out at a granular spatial resolution of census tracts to explore the spatial patterns and contextual SDOH associated with COVID-19 incidence from a Hispanic population mostly consisting of a Mexican American population living in Cameron County, Texas on the border of the United States and Mexico. We performed age-stratified analysis to identify different contributing SDOH and quantify their effects by age groups. METHODS: We included all reported COVID-19–positive cases confirmed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction testing between March 18 (first case reported) and December 16, 2020, in Cameron County, Texas. Confirmed COVID-19 cases were aggregated to weekly counts by census tracts. We adopted a Bayesian spatiotemporal negative binomial model to investigate the COVID-19 incidence rate in relation to census tract demographics and SDOH obtained from the American Community Survey. Moreover, we investigated the impact of local mitigation policy on COVID-19 by creating the binary variable “shelter-in-place.” The analysis was performed on all COVID-19–confirmed cases and age-stratified subgroups. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that the relative incidence risk (RR) of COVID-19 was higher among census tracts with a higher percentage of single-parent households (RR=1.016, 95% posterior credible intervals [CIs] 1.005, 1.027) and a higher percentage of the population with limited English proficiency (RR=1.015, 95% CI 1.003, 1.028). Lower RR was associated with lower income (RR=0.972, 95% CI 0.953, 0.993) and the percentage of the population younger than 18 years (RR=0.976, 95% CI 0.959, 0.993). The most significant association was related to the “shelter-in-place” variable, where the incidence risk of COVID-19 was reduced by over 50%, comparing the time periods when the policy was present versus absent (RR=0.506, 95% CI 0.454, 0.563). Moreover, age-stratified analyses identified different significant contributing factors and a varying magnitude of the “shelter-in-place” effect. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, SDOH including social environment and local emergency measures were identified in relation to COVID-19 incidence risk at the census tract level in a highly disadvantaged population with limited health care access and a high prevalence of chronic conditions. Results from our analysis provide key knowledge to design efficient testing strategies and assist local public health departments in COVID-19 control, mitigation, and implementation of vaccine strategies.","Bauer, Cici; Zhang, Kehe; Lee, Miryoung; Fisher-Hoch, Susan; Guajardo, Esmeralda; McCormick, Joseph; de la Cerda, Isela; Fernandez, Maria E; Reininger, Belinda",JMIR Public Health Surveill,157,1

The high fatality of aged cases caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 was a need to explore the possible age‐related phenomena with non‐human primate models. METHODS: Three 3‐5 years old and two 15 years old rhesus macaques were intratracheally infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, and then analyzed by clinical signs, viral replication, chest X‐ray, histopathological changes and immune response. RESULTS: Viral replication of nasopharyngeal swabs, anal swabs and lung in old monkeys was more active than that in young monkeys for 14 days after SARS‐CoV‐2 challenge. Monkeys developed typical interstitial pneumonia characterized by thickened alveolar septum accompanied with inflammation and edema, notably, old monkeys exhibited diffuse severe interstitial pneumonia. Viral antigens were detected mainly in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. CONCLUSION: SARS‐CoV‐2 caused more severe interstitial pneumonia in old monkeys than that in young monkeys.

The influx of patients with lung function deterioration as a result of COVID-19 has strained traditional ventilator supplies. To bridge the gap during ventilator shortages and to help clinicians triage patients, manual resuscitator devices can be used to deliver respirations to a patient requiring breathing support. Bag-valve mask (BVM) devices are ubiquitous in ambulances and healthcare environments, however require a medical professional to be present and constantly applying compression to provide the patient with respirations. We developed an automated manual resuscitator-based emergency ventilator-alternative (AMREV) that provides automated compressions of a BVM in a repetitive manner and is broadly compatible with commercially-available BVM devices approximately 5 inches (128 mm) in diameter. The AMREV device relieves the medical professional from providing manual breathing support and allows for hands-free operation of the BVM. The AMREV supports the following treatment parameters: 1) adjustable tidal volume (V(T)), 2) positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (intrinsic and/or external), 3) 1:1 inspiratory: expiratory ratio, and 4) a controllable respiratory rate between 10-30 breaths per minute. The relationship between the inherent resistance and compliance of the lung and the delivered breaths was assessed for the AMREV device. Adjustable V(T) of 110-700 ml was achieved within the range of simulated lung states. A linear increase in mean airway pressure (P(aw)), from 10-40 cmH(2)O was observed, as the resistance and compliance on the lung model moved from normal to severe simulated disease states. The AMREV functioned continuously for seven days with less than 3.2% variation in delivered V(T) and P(aw). Additionally, the AMREV device was compatible with seven commercially-available BVM setups and delivered consistent V(T) and P(aw) within 10% between models. This automated BVM-based emergency-use resuscitator can provide consistent positive pressure, volume-controlled ventilation over an extended duration when a traditional ventilator is not available. True ventilator shortages may lead to manual resuscitators devices such as the AMREV being the only option for some healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Urbina, Jesica; Monks, Stormy M; Ochoa, Luis; Stump, Robert F; Wicker, Ryan B; Danek, Chris; Torres, Victor I; Crawford, Scott B",Cureus,157,17

Published information suggests that flies (Diptera) may play a role in spreading this virus; however, they have not been studied extensively and the degree of their involvement is not known. This investigation was directed toward evaluating the vector capacity of such flies and determining their potential role in the transmission and ecology of CPV. Molecular diagnostic methods were used in this cross-sectional study to detect the presence of CPV in flies trapped at thirty-eight canine facilities. The flies involved were identified as belonging to the house fly (Mucidae), flesh fly (Sarcophagidae) and blow/bottle fly (Calliphoridae) families. A primary surveillance location (PSL) was established at a canine facility in south-central South Carolina, USA, to identify fly–virus interaction within the canine facility environment. Flies trapped at this location were pooled monthly and assayed for CPV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. These insects were found to be positive for CPV every month from February through the end of November 2011. Fly vector behavior and seasonality were documented and potential environmental risk factors were evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare the mean numbers of each of the three fly families captured, and after determining fly CPV status (positive or negative), it was determined whether there were significant relationships between numbers of flies captured, seasonal numbers of CPV cases, temperature and rainfall. Flies were also sampled at thirty-seven additional canine facility surveillance locations (ASL) and at four non-canine animal industry locations serving as negative field controls. Canine facility risk factors were identified and evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted on the number of CPV cases reported within the past year to determine the correlation of fly CPV status (positive or negative) for each facility, facility design (open or closed), mean number of dogs present monthly and number of flies captured. Significant differences occurred between fly CPV positive vs. negative sites with regard to their CPV case numbers, fly numbers captured, and number of dogs present. At the ASL, a statistically significant relationship was found between PCR-determined fly CPV status (positive or negative) and facility design (open vs. closed). Open-facility designs were likely to have more CPV outbreaks and more likely to have flies testing positive for CPV DNA.","Bagshaw, Clarence; Isdell, Allen E.; Thiruvaiyaru, Dharma S.; Brisbin, I.

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in a pooled interim analysis of four trials. METHODS: This analysis includes data from four ongoing blinded, randomised, controlled trials done across the UK, Brazil, and South Africa. Participants aged 18 years and older were randomly assigned (1:1) to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or control (meningococcal group A, C, W, and Y conjugate vaccine or saline). Participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group received two doses containing 5 × 10(10) viral particles (standard dose; SD/SD cohort); a subset in the UK trial received a half dose as their first dose (low dose) and a standard dose as their second dose (LD/SD cohort). The primary efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a nucleic acid amplification test-positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were analysed according to treatment received, with data cutoff on Nov 4, 2020. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1 - relative risk derived from a robust Poisson regression model adjusted for age. Studies are registered at ISRCTN89951424 and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606, NCT04400838, and NCT04444674. FINDINGS: Between April 23 and Nov 4, 2020, 23 848 participants were enrolled and 11 636 participants (7548 in the UK, 4088 in Brazil) were included in the interim primary efficacy analysis. In participants who received two standard doses, vaccine efficacy was 62·1% (95% CI 41·0–75·7; 27 [0·6%] of 4440 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group vs71 [1·6%] of 4455 in the control group) and in participants who received a low dose followed by a standard dose, efficacy was 90·0% (67·4–97·0; three [0·2%] of 1367 vs 30 [2·2%] of 1374; p(interaction)=0·010). Overall vaccine efficacy across both groups was 70·4% (95·8% CI 54·8–80·6; 30 [0·5%] of 5807 vs 101 [1·7%] of 5829). From 21 days after the first dose, there were ten cases hospitalised for COVID-19, all in the control arm; two were classified as severe COVID-19, including one death. There were 74 341 person-months of safety follow-up (median 3·4 months, IQR 1·3–4·8): 175 severe adverse events occurred in 168 participants, 84 events in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 91 in the control group. Three events were classified as possibly related to a vaccine: one in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, one in the control group, and one in a participant who remains masked to group allocation.

Traditional Chinese medicine has recommended the use of liquorice (Glycyrrhiza species) in the treatment of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the present investigation was carried out to identify the active molecule from the liquorice against different protein targets of COVID-19 using an in-silico approach. The molecular docking simulation study of 20 compounds along with two standard antiviral drugs (Lopinavir and Rivabirin) was carried out with the help of Autodock vina software using two protein targets from COVID-19 i.e. spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VSB) and Non-structural Protein-15 (Nsp15) endoribonuclease (PDB ID: 6W01). From the observed binding energy and the binding interactions, glyasperin A showed high affinity towards Nsp15 endoribonuclease with uridine specificity, while glycyrrhizic acid was found to be best suited for the binding pocket of spike glycoprotein and also prohibited the entry of the virus into the host cell. Further, the dynamic behavior of the best-docked molecules inside the spike glycoprotein and Nsp15 endoribonuclease were explored through all-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study. Several parameters from the MD simulation have substantiated the stability of protein-ligand stability. The binding free energy of both glyasperin A and glycyrrhizic acid was calculated from the entire MD simulation trajectory through the MM-PBSA approach and found to high binding affinity towards the respective protein receptor cavity.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study, including elderly COVID-19 patients admitted to Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital between February 10 and 13, 2020. Demographic data, medical history, signs and symptoms, and laboratory parameters were collected and analysed. RESULTS: We included 131 elderly COVID-19 patients (50 patients with diabetes). COVID-19 diabetes patients experienced more severe pneumonia and abnormal organ functions than non-diabetes patients (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Most function indicators were significantly different between the mild to moderate and severely ill groups in diabetes patients (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Python analysis confirmed diabetes was the independent risk factor of COVID-19 progression in elderly patients. All blood glucose (BG) indices went into the risk factor equation. The cut-off values of COVID-19 progression were BG value on admission > 8.0 mmol/L or maximum BG value > 12.0 mmol/L in all elderly patients, and BG value on admission > 5.1 mmol/L or maximum BG value > 5.4 mmol/L in non-diabetes patients. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is an independent important risk factor, and glucose levels associate closely with COVID-19 progression in elderly patients.","Zhang, Pei; Wang, Maomao; Wang, Yang; Wang, Yifei; Li, Ting; Zeng, Jing; Wang, Laixing; Li, Chunlin; Gong, Yanping",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,157,16

A scientific statement on behalf of the British and Irish Hypertension Society,15.610046,6.034895,2021-01-22,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection presents a significant global public health burden. In 2015, over 400000 deaths worldwide were attributed to HCV infection. This led the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016 to set the ambitious goal of eliminating HCV by 2030. Adult-centered guidelines have been established in order to provide direction for healthcare professionals, allowing integration of the newest screening policies and therapeutic strategies into their practices. However, for children and adolescents, HCV is a significant, unrecognized public health problem. HCV infection rates in the United States in women of childbearing age and those who are pregnant have increased in parallel with the rising opioid epidemic. An estimated 29000 women with HCV infection gave birth each year from 2011 to 2014 in the United States, with approximately 1700 of their infants being infected with HCV. Newer HCV-specific therapeutics, namely direct acting antivirals (DAA), has brought a new and highly successful approach to treatment of hepatitis C. Recent studies have confirmed similar levels of effectiveness and safety of DAA therapies in the pediatric population. Thus, an enhanced cascade of care, which should include the population under 18 years of age, can help achieve the WHO goal by focusing on elimination in the youngest populations. This review will present an overview of the natural history, clinical features, and management of HCV in children and adolescents.","Rogers, Michael Evan; Balistreri, William F",World J Gastroenterol,157,20

METHODS: We randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, hospitalized adults with Covid-19 pneumonia to receive either tofacitinib at a dose of 10 mg or placebo twice daily for up to 14 days or until hospital discharge. The primary outcome was the occurrence of death or respiratory failure through day 28 as assessed with the use of an eight-level ordinal scale (with scores ranging from 1 to 8 and higher scores indicating a worse condition). All-cause mortality and safety were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 289 patients underwent randomization at 15 sites in Brazil. Overall, 89.3% of the patients received glucocorticoids during hospitalization. The cumulative incidence of death or respiratory failure through day 28 was 18.1% in the tofacitinib group and 29.0% in the placebo group (risk ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.97; P=0.04). Death from any cause through day 28 occurred in 2.8% of the patients in the tofacitinib group and in 5.5% of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.15 to 1.63). The proportional odds of having a worse score on the eight-level ordinal scale with tofacitinib, as compared with placebo, was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.36 to 1.00) at day 14 and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.27 to 1.06) at day 28. Serious adverse events occurred in 20 patients (14.1%) in the tofacitinib group and in 17 (12.0%) in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia, tofacitinib led to a lower risk of death or respiratory failure through day 28 than placebo.

Novel decision models for vaccine selection need to be developed. In this study, a novel vaccine selection decision-making model (VSDMM) was proposed and developed, based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique, which assesses many alternatives (vaccines) using multi-criteria to support decision making. To feed data to the VSDMM, six coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) vaccines were selected in a case study to highlight the applicability of the proposed model. Each vaccine was compared to the others with respect to six criteria and all criteria were compared to calculate the relative weights. The proposed criteria include (1) vaccine availability; (2) vaccine formula; (3) vaccine efficacy; (4) vaccine-related side effects; (5) cost savings, and (6) host-related factors. Using the selected criteria, experts responded to questions and currently available COVID-19 vaccines were ranked according to their weight in the model. A sensitivity analysis was introduced to assess the model robustness and the impacts of changing criteria weights on the results. The VSDMM is flexible in terms of its ability to accept more vaccine alternatives and/or more criteria. It could also be applied to other current or future pandemics/epidemics in the world. In conclusion, this is the first report to propose a VSDMM for selecting the most suitable vaccines in pandemic/epidemic situations or any other situations in which vaccine selection and usage may be deemed necessary.","Abdelwahab, Sayed F.; Issa, Usama H.; Ashour, Hossam M.",Vaccines (Basel),157,20

BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 outbreak has overwhelmed health care institutions; as a consequence, nurses’ lives and psycho‐physical health have been affected. INTRODUCTION: The COVID‐19 pandemic forced nurses to work in physically and psychologically stressful conditions impacting on their life. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study. All narratives (texts and videos) posted by nurses from the 23(rd) of February 2020 to the 3(rd) of May (from the start of the outbreak to the end of the first lockdown) were analysed and published on the five most popular Italian professional social media platforms. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative research guidelines were followed. RESULTS: Five themes emerged from the 380 narratives explored: ‘Sharing what is happening within myself’; ‘Experiencing unprecedented working conditions’; ‘Experiencing a deep change’; ‘Failing to rehabilitate the image of nurses in society’; and ‘Do not abandon us’. Even though nurses appreciated the recognition of their communities, they still felt devalued and not recognized as professionals. DISCUSSION: Several psychological, physical, social and professional implications emerged from nurses working during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Despite being highly praised, nurses perceived they had failed in rehabilitating the image of nurses in society. CONCLUSION: The experience of working during the COVID‐19 pandemic represented a traumatic event for nurses but it offered them personal and professional growth opportunities. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE, NURSING POLICY AND HEALTH POLICY: Supporting nurses’ mental health is highly recommended, together with a cultural investment on nurses’ role recognition, and a zero‐tolerance policy towards violence and aggression towards nurses.","Fontanini, Roberta; Visintini, Erica; Rossettini, Giacomo; Caruzzo, Davide; Longhini, Jessica; Palese, Alvisa",Int Nurs Rev,157,6

Initially thought to be restricted to the respiratory system, we now understand that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) also involves multiple other organs including the central and peripheral nervous system. The number of recognized neurologic manifestations of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is rapidly accumulating. These may result from a variety of mechanisms including virus‐induced hyper‐inflammatory and hypercoagulable states, direct virus infection of the CNS, and post‐infectious immune mediated processes. Example of COVID‐19 CNS disease include encephalopathy, encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, meningitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, venous sinus thrombosis and endothelialitis. In the peripheral nervous system COVID‐19 is associated with dysfunction of smell and taste, muscle injury, the Guillain‐Barre syndrome and its variants. Due to its worldwide distribution and multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms, COVID‐19 poses a global threat to the entire nervous system. While our understanding of SARS‐CoV‐2 neuropathogenesis is still incomplete and our knowledge is evolving rapidly, we hope that this review will provide a useful framework and help neurologists in understanding the many neurologic facets of COVID‐19.","Koralnik, Igor.

The objective of this study was to determine whether a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risk of adverse postoperative events following surgery in patients with cancer. METHODS: This was a propensity-matched cohort study from April 6, 2020 to October 31, 2020 at the UT MD Anderson Cancer Center. Cancer patients were identified who underwent elective surgery after recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection and matched to controls based on patient, disease, and surgical factors. Primary study outcome was a composite of the following adverse postoperative events that occurred within 30 days of surgery: death, unplanned readmission, pneumonia, cardiac injury, or thromboembolic event. RESULTS: A total of 5682 patients were included for study, and 114 (2.0%) had a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. The average time from infection to surgery was 52 (range 20–202) days. Compared with matched controls, there was no difference in the rate of adverse postoperative outcome (14.3% vs. 13.4%, p = 1.0). Patients with a SARS-CoV-2-related inpatient admission before surgery had increased odds of postoperative complication (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 7.4 [1.6–34.3], p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A minimal wait time of 20 days after recovering from minimally symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be safe for cancer patients undergoing low-risk elective surgery. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections requiring inpatient treatment were at increased risk for adverse events after surgery. Additional wait time may be required in those with more severe infections.

Hospitalizations for acute cardiovascular conditions have declined, raising concern that patients may be avoiding hospitals because of fear of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome- coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Other factors, including strain on health care systems, may also have had an indirect toll. OBJECTIVES: This investigation aimed to evaluate whether population-level deaths due to cardiovascular causes increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The authors conducted an observational cohort study using data from the National Center for Health Statistics to evaluate the rate of deaths due to cardiovascular causes after the onset of the pandemic in the United States, from March 18, 2020, to June 2, 2020, relative to the period immediately preceding the pandemic (January 1, 2020 to March 17, 2020). Changes in deaths were compared with the same periods in the previous year. RESULTS: There were 397,042 cardiovascular deaths from January 1, 2020, to June 2, 2020. Deaths caused by ischemic heart disease increased nationally after the onset of the pandemic in 2020, compared with changes over the same period in 2019 (ratio of the relative change in deaths per 100,000 in 2020 vs. 2019: 1.11, 95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.18). An increase was also observed for deaths caused by hypertensive disease (1.17, 95% confidence interval: 1.09 to 1.26), but not for heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, or other diseases of the circulatory system. New York City experienced a large relative increase in deaths caused by ischemic heart disease (2.39, 95% confidence interval: 1.39 to 4.09) and hypertensive diseases (2.64, 95% confidence interval: 1.52 to 4.56) during the pandemic. More modest increases in deaths caused by these conditions occurred in the remainder of New York State, New Jersey, Michigan, and Illinois but not in Massachusetts or Louisiana. CONCLUSIONS: There was an increase in deaths caused by ischemic heart disease and hypertensive diseases in some regions of the United States during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that the pandemic may have had an indirect toll on patients with cardiovascular disease.","Wadhera, Rishi K.; Shen, Changyu; Gondi, Suhas; Chen, Siyan; Kazi, Dhruv S.; Yeh, Robert W.",J Am Coll Cardiol,157,24

PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the trends in UCL surgeries over 3 years in Division I baseball programs. We hypothesized that surgical injuries would be consistently high over the course of the study. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: Athletic trainers from Division I baseball programs were invited to participate in an electronic survey over 3 seasons. A total of 155 baseball programs agreed to participate in 2017, 294 programs participated in 2018, and 296 programs participated in 2019. After each of the 3 collegiate baseball seasons, the athletic trainer from each program entered anonymous, detailed descriptive data and surgical information on injured players into a secured database. RESULTS: During the 3 years of this study, 100% of the enrolled programs successfully completed the survey (155/155 in year 1, 294/294 in year 2, and 296/296 in year 3). This registry of 745 completed surveys over 3 years represented 25,587 player-years from Division I collegiate baseball. The percentage of programs with at least 1 UCL surgery during this time was 57% in 2017, 51% in 2018, and 49% in 2019. The majority of these players were pitchers (84% overall from the 3 years). Seniors underwent a significantly lower percentage of the UCL surgeries (8% in 2017, 10% in 2018, and 13% in 2019) than did underclassmen. Surgeries were performed most often in-season and least often during the preseason. A slight majority of players undergoing surgery originated from warm-weather states, but the number of these players was never significantly higher than was the number of players from cold-weather states. Most surgeries performed each year were UCL reconstruction, but the percentage of UCL repair with ligament augmentation increased each year (10% UCL repairs in 2017, 20% in 2018, and 25% in 2019). CONCLUSION: UCL injuries requiring surgery were found to be a major source of morbidity in Division I collegiate baseball, supporting our hypothesis. This study can serve as a baseline for tracking long-term trends in UCL surgeries in collegiate baseball.","Rothermich, Marcus A.; Fleisig, Glenn S.; Conte, Stan A.; Hart, Karen M.; Cain, E.

We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020. METHODS: In this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done. FINDINGS: The patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log(10) copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020. INTERPRETATION: We illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.

We performed a prospective study of grouped cohorts on the donation and distribution of blood in four regional transfusion centers in four autonomous communities in Spain, and a retrospective study of the consumption of blood components in ten hospitals in six autonomous communities. Regarding donations, there was no significant decrease in donations, with differences between autonomous communities, which started between 1 and 15 March 2020 (−11%). The increase in donations in phase II (from 26 May 2020) stands out. Regarding consumption, there was a significant reduction in the consumption of packed red blood cells (RBCs) (24.5%), plasma (45.3%), and platelets (25.3%) in the central period (16 March–10 May).

The convenience sample included 3089 students, with a mean of age of 20.3 (SD = 1.9). To the question on the intention to vaccinate against the COVID-19, 58.0% of students reported that they would choose to have a vaccination, 17.0% reported that they would not and 25.0% were not sure. The main motivations for vaccine acceptance were “I don′t want to transmit COVID-19 to others”, the main barriers for vaccine resistance or hesitancy were “I prefer to wait until I have more experience with these new vaccines”. Age, female gender, being in first three years of study, studied sciences courses and neither sciences nor healthcare courses of study were significantly associated with a higher risk of vaccine hesitancy or resistancy. Self-estimated knowledge of conventional vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines, and confidence in efficiency and safety of conventional vaccination were associated with a lower risk of vaccine hesitancy or resistancy.

COVID-19 severity and consequences largely depend on patient age and health status. In this review, we will summarize and comparatively analyze how viruses regulate the host epigenome. Mainly, we will be focusing on highly pathogenic respiratory RNA virus infections such as coronaviruses. In this context, epigenetic alterations might play an essential role in the onset of coronavirus disease complications. Although many therapeutic approaches are under study, more research is urgently needed to identify effective vaccine or safer chemotherapeutic drugs, including epigenetic drugs, to cope with this viral outbreak and to develop pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis against COVID-19.","Atlante, Sandra; Mongelli, Alessia; Barbi, Veronica; Martelli, Fabio; Farsetti, Antonella; Gaetano, Carlo",Clin Epigenetics,157,10

Modestly sized case series have described clinical factors associated with COVID-19, while ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression analyses have been described in some cell types. Cancer patients may have worse outcomes to COVID-19. Methods: We performed an integrated study of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression across and within organ systems, by normal versus tumor, across several existing databases (The Cancer Genome Atlas, Census of Immune Single Cell Expression Atlas, The Human Cell Landscape, and more). We correlated gene expression with clinical factors (including but not limited to age, gender, race, BMI and smoking history), HLA genotype, immune gene expression patterns, cell subsets, and single-cell sequencing as well as commensal microbiome. Results: Matched normal tissues generally display higher ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression compared with cancer, with normal and tumor from digestive organs expressing the highest levels. No clinical factors were consistently identified to be significantly associated with gene expression levels though outlier organ systems were observed for some factors. Similarly, no HLA genotypes were consistently associated with gene expression levels. Strong correlations were observed between ACE2 expression levels and multiple immune gene signatures including interferon-stimulated genes and the T cell-inflamed phenotype as well as inverse associations with angiogenesis and transforming growth factor-{beta} signatures. ACE2 positively correlated with macrophage subsets across tumor types. TMPRSS2 was less associated with immune gene expression but was strongly associated with epithelial cell abundance. Single-cell sequencing analysis across nine independent studies demonstrated little to no ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression in lymphocytes or macrophages. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression associated with commensal microbiota in matched normal tissues particularly from colorectal cancers, with distinct bacterial populations showing strong associations. Conclusions: We performed a large-scale integration of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression across clinical, genetic, and microbiome domains. We identify novel associations with the microbiota and confirm host immunity associations with gene expression. We suggest caution in interpretation regarding genetic associations with ACE2 expression suggested from smaller case series.","Bao, R.; Hernandez, K.; Huang, L.; Luke, J. J.",,157,16

During the global pandemic COVID-19, urology surgeons had to reorganize their daily surgical practice. A concern with the use of minimally invasive techniques arose due to a proposed risk of viral transmission of the coronavirus disease with the creation of pneumoperitoneum. Due to this, we reviewed the literature to evaluate the use of laparoscopy and robotics during the pandemic COVID-19. A literature review of viral transmission in surgery and of the available literature regarding the transmission of the COVID-19 virus was performed up to April 30, 2020. We additionally reviewed surgical society guidelines and recommendations regarding surgery during this pandemic. Few studies have been performed on viral transmission during surgery. No study has been made regarding this area during minimally invasive urology cases. To date there is no study that demonstrates or can suggest the ability for a virus to be transmitted during surgical treatment whether open, laparoscopic or robotic. There is no society consensus on restricting laparoscopic or robotic surgery. However, there is expert consensus on modification of standard practices to minimize any risk of transmission. During the pandemic COVID-19 we recommend the use of specific personal protective equipment for the surgeon, anesthesiologist and nursing staff in the operating room. Modifications of standard practices during minimally invasive surgery such as using lowest intra-abdominal pressures possible, controlled smoke evacuation systems, and minimizing energy device usage are recommended.","Zampolli, Hamilton C.; Rodriguez, Alejandro R.",Int Braz J Urol,157,1

Additionally, in severely ill or immunocompromised adults, where respiratory infections are mostly attributed to bacteria and fungi; respiratory viruses can lead to severe complications. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) specimens from patients with lower respiratory tract disease. The study population consisted of different groups including immunocompetent patients (control patients), solid organ transplant recipients, patients with haematological malignancies and other immunocompromised adults. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 134 BAL fluid specimens collected during 2009–2011 were retrospectively assessed with the new commercial multiplex real-time PCR FTD Respiratory 21 Plus(®), targeting 18 different viruses and 2 atypical bacterial pathogens. RESULTS: Viral or atypical bacterial pathogens were detected in 29.1% of BAL fluid specimens. Coronaviruses were most prevalent (13.4%), followed by rhinoviruses (5.2%), RSV (4.5%) and bocaviruses (3.7%). Comparing the total number of viruses detected, a statistically significant difference was observed between the control group and patients with haematological malignancies (27.5% vs. 57.1%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study highlights the high prevalence of respiratory viruses in BAL fluid specimens from adult patients with lower respiratory tract disease. The methods to be used should be sensitive and cover a wide range of potential pathogens. The specific patient population can also influence the detection rates of respiratory viruses.","Drieghe, Stefanie; Ryckaert, Inge; Beuselinck, Kurt; Lagrou, Katrien; Padalko, Elizaveta",J Clin Virol,157,24

Antibody levels against six SARS-CoV-2 and four HCoV antigens were quantified by Luminex, and antibody neutralization capacity was assessed by flow cytometry in a cohort of health care workers followed-up for 6 months. Seroprevalence increased over time from 13.5% (month 0) and 15.6% (month 1), to 16.4% (month 6). Levels of antibodies were stable over time, except IgG against nucleocapsid antigen and IgM levels that waned. After the peak response, anti-spike antibody levels increased from ~150 days post-symptom onset in all individuals (73% for IgG), in the absence of any evidence of re-exposure. The neutralizing capacity of antibodies was maintained. Pre-existing antibodies to alpha-HCoV were lower in individuals who subsequently seroconverted for SARS-CoV-2. IgG and IgA to HCoV were significantly higher in asymptomatic than symptomatic seropositive individuals. Thus, pre-existing cross-reactive HCoVs antibodies could have a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.","Ortega, N.; Ribes, M.; Vidal, M.; Rubio, R.; Aguilar, R.; Williams, S.; Barrios, D.; Alonso, S.; Hernandez-Luis, P.; Mitchell, R.

METHODS: Cases of 15 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed: their epidemiology, clinical history, laboratory tests, and multiple CT chest scans obtained during the disease period were studied. RESULTS: The CT scans of the 15 patients showed different results. Four patients had no abnormal findings in their chest CT scans. The first scan of 1 patient revealed right lower lobe inflammation, while the lesion had been completely absorbed in follow-up. Two patients showed bilateral pulmonary inflammation in the first scan which had been absorbed by follow-up but the last examination showed extensive fibrosis. Two patients had no abnormalities in their first CT scans, while pulmonary inflammation was found in the second scan and this had not been completely absorbed by the last follow-up. One patient had pulmonary interstitial lesions with no evidence of National Cochlear Implant Programme (NCIP) on the first and second CT scans. NCIP was found at the third scan, and pulmonary inflammation was not completely absorbed at the last follow-up. Three patients were in the early stage of inflammation at the first scan, and the lesions were absorbed and repaired at the last follow-up. However, the lesions were not completely absorbed. One patient was in the advanced stage at the first scan, and the last follow-up pulmonary lesions were not completely absorbed. The first CT scan of 1 patient revealed large ground-glass opacity in the lungs involving the inner and middle bands. After follow-up, the disease progressed, and this condition was consistent with severe manifestations. CONCLUSION: The follow-up of chest CT can reflect the change process of NCIP and the treatment effect. The first CT scan of lung lesions has a certain predictive effect on the outcome and prognosis of patients.","Deng, Lingbo; Khan, Aisha; Zhou, Wen; Dai, Yi; Md Eftekhar; Chen, Renzheng; Cheng, Guanxun",Radiol Infect Dis,157,1

At this stage of development, the relevant factors of coping strategies need to be further studied, in which social support and self-esteem are worthy of our attention. The aim of this study is to detect the current situation of self-esteem, social support, and coping styles of left-behind children (LBC) in rural China. METHODS: 322 children from 3 schools in China enrolled in this study, including 236 LBC and 86 non-left-behind children (NLBC) to assess self-esteem, social support and coping strategies. RESULTS: The LBC group had lower self-esteem score and lower total social support (subjective support, objective support and support-seeking behavior) than the NLBC group. In terms of coping strategies, the LBC group was lower than the NLBC group in problem-solving and rationalization. The self-esteem score in LBC was significant positive associated with the subjective support score, objective support score, problem-solving and help-seeking score. In addition, self-esteem has significant mediating effect between subjective support and problem-solving, subjective support and help-seeking, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The finding indicate that Chinese LBC’s self-esteem and social support need to be improved. Given the significant correlativity between self-esteem, subjective support and coping strategy, it is necessary to promote Chinese LBC’s self-esteem and social support, especially subjective support.","Cui, Shu; Cheng, Fangshuo; Zhang, Ling; Zhang, Chao; Yuan, Qiuyu; Huang, Cui; Zhang, Kai; Zhou, Xiaoqin",BMC Psychiatry,157,16

The screen revealed a high-score interaction with cyclin D3, a key regulator of cell cycle early G(1) phase. M2-cyclin D3 interaction was validated through GST pull-down and recapitulated in influenza A/WSN/33-infected cells. Knockdown of Ccnd3 by small interfering RNA significantly enhanced virus progeny titers in cell culture supernatants. Interestingly, the increase in virus production was due to cyclin D3 deficiency per se and not merely a consequence of cell cycle deregulation. A combined knockdown of Ccnd3 and Rb1, which rescued cell cycle progression into S phase, failed to normalize virus production. Infection by influenza A virus triggered redistribution of cyclin D3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, followed by its proteasomal degradation. When overexpressed in HEK 293T cells, cyclin D3 impaired binding of M2 with M1, which is essential for proper assembly of progeny virions, lending further support to its role as a putative restriction factor. Our study describes the identification and characterization of cyclin D3 as a novel interactor of influenza A virus M2 protein. We hypothesize that competitive inhibition of M1-M2 interaction by cyclin D3 impairs infectious virion formation and results in attenuated virus production. In addition, we provide mechanistic insights into the dynamic interplay of influenza virus with the host cell cycle machinery during infection.","Fan, Ying; Mok, Chris Ka-Pun; Chan, Michael Chi Wai; Zhang, Yang; Nal, Béatrice; Kien, François; Bruzzone, Roberto; Sanyal, Sumana",J Biol Chem,157,5

Many institutions have instituted mandatory preoperative SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasopharyngeal swab (NS) testing in patients who are low risk for COVID-19 prior to elective cases. This method, however, is challenging as the sensitivity, specificity, and overall reliability of testing remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the concordance of a negative NS in low risk preoperative patients with lower airway bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens obtained from the same patients. METHODS: We prospectively sent intraoperative lower airway BAL samples collected within 48 h of a negative mandatory preoperative NS for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. All adult patients undergoing a scheduled bronchoscopic procedure for any reason were enrolled, including elective and nonelective cases. RESULTS: One-hundred eighty-nine patients were included. All BAL specimens were negative for SARS-CoV-2 indicative of 100% concordance between testing modalities. CONCLUSIONS: These results are promising and suggest that preoperative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 testing provides adequate screening to rule out active COVID-19 infection prior to OR cases in a population characterized as low risk by negative symptom screening.

COVID-19 is a new disease that is highly infectious and dangerous. It has deeply shaken the world, claiming the lives of over a million people and bringing the world to a lockdown. So, the early detection of COVID is essential for the patients’ timely treatment and preventive measures. A filtering technique with time-varying parameters is presented to predict the stochastic volatility (SV) of COVID-19 cases. The time-varying parameters are estimated using the Kalman filtering technique based on the stochastic component of data volatility. Kalman filtering is essential as it removes insignificant information from the data. We forecast one-step-ahead predicted volatility with [Formula: see text] standard prediction errors, which is implemented by Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We conclude that Kalman filtering in conjunction with the SV model is a reliable predictive model for COVID-19 since it is less constrained by the past autoregressive information.","Masum Bhuiyan, Md Al; Mahmud, Suhail; Islam, Md.

Current treatments for MS focus on attenuating immune cell infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS). These treatments decrease the number of relapses, improving quality of life, but do not completely eliminate relapses so long-term disability is not improved. Therefore, therapeutic agents that protect the CNS are warranted. In both animal models as well as human patients with MS, T cell entry into the CNS is generally considered the initiating inflammatory event. In order to assess if a drug protects the CNS, any potential effects on immune cell infiltration or proliferation in the periphery must be ruled out. This protocol describes how to determine whether CNS protection observed after drug intervention is a consequence of attenuating CNS-infiltrating immune cells or blocking death of CNS cells during inflammatory insults. The ability to examine MS treatments that are protective to the CNS during inflammatory insults is highly critical for the advancement of therapeutic strategies since current treatments reduce, but do not completely eliminate, relapses (i.e., immune cell infiltration), leaving the CNS vulnerable to degeneration.","Evonuk, Kirsten S.; Moseley, Carson E.; Doyle, Ryan E.; Weaver, Casey T.; DeSilva, Tara M.",J Vis Exp,157,1

Literature describing the development of effective peer support programs is limited. This article describes the implementation of a peer support program for an entire health care system. METHODS: The research team initially trained 52 supporters representing all clinical areas throughout an urban academic quaternary care campus. Each then supported at-risk colleagues, raised awareness of SVS, and recruited others for training. Triggers for peer support expanded to include medical errors, unanticipated patient outcomes, inability to stop the progression of medical conditions, medical emergencies of colleagues, aggressive behavior by a patient/family member, and COVID-19 events. Data reporting supporters' efforts were summarized. After the initial 5-hour session, training was condensed into 2.5 hours. The effectiveness of these training sessions was assessed. The Second Victim Experience and Support Tool (SVEST) was used to assess program effectiveness three and nine months after implementation. RESULTS: By 18 months, a blended program was achieved with 149 supporters: 81 medical college and 68 hospital personnel. Providers received 46.5% of support efforts and hospital personnel 47.9%. The most common event supported was inability to stop the progression of medical conditions (24.5%). Both training sessions improved attendees' knowledge of SVS and improved their comfort with teaching others how to support a second victim. Both SVEST surveys showed that nonwork and supervisor support rated highest, followed by colleague support. Institution support rated lowest.

Since the cerebellum is involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD), c-tDCS may represent an intervention with potential to improve motor learning in PD. The primary purpose was to determine the influence of long-term application of c-tDCS on motor learning in PD. The secondary purpose was to examine the influence of long-term application of c-tDCS on transfer of motor learning in PD. The study was a randomized, double-blind, SHAM-controlled, between-subjects design. Twenty-one participants with PD were allocated to either a tDCS group or a SHAM stimulation group. Participants completed 9 practice sessions over a 2-week period that involved extensive practice of an isometric pinch grip task (PGT) and a rapid arm movement task (AMT). These practice tasks were performed over a 25-min period concurrent with either anodal c-tDCS or SHAM stimulation. A set of transfer tasks that included clinical rating scales, manual dexterity tests, and lower extremity assessments were quantified in Test sessions at Baseline, 1, 14, and 28 days after the end of practice (EOP). There were no significant differences between the c-tDCS and SHAM groups as indicated by performance changes in the practice and transfer tasks from Baseline to the 3 EOP Tests.

First launched in Switzerland on 25 June 2020, the SwissCovid digital proximity tracing app has now been in use for more than one year. In light of this milestone, we raise the questions: What is currently known about the role of SwissCovid in mitigating the pandemic? Were the expectations fulfilled? âIn this review, we will summarise the current state of the literature from empirical studies on the adoption, performance and effectiveness of SwissCovid. The review consists of three sections. The first section summarizes findings from effectiveness studies, which suggest that SwissCovid exposure notifications contributed to preventive actions in 76% of exposure notification recipients and were associated with a faster quarantine time in some SwissCovid user groups. The second describes the public perception and current state of adoption of SwissCovid in Switzerland in light of prevalent misconceptions and overemphasised expectations. the third places the evidence on SwissCovid in an international context. Specifically, we compare key performance indicators of SwissCovid, which are of similar magnitude as for digital proximity tracing apps from other European countries. Using findings from Switzerland, we subsequently derive a preliminary measure of the population-level effectiveness of digital proximity tracing apps. We estimate that exposure notifications may have contributed to the notification and identification of 500 to 1000 SARS-CoV-2-positive app users per month. We explore why this effectiveness estimation is somewhat lower when compared with Germany or the United Kingdom. âIn light of the presented evidence, we conclude that digital proximity tracing works well in specific contexts, such as in mitigating non-household spread. However, future applications of digital proximity tracing should invest into stakeholder onboarding and increased process automatization - without deviating from the principles of voluntariness and user privacy.","Daniore, Paola; Ballouz, Tala; Menges, Dominik; von Wyl, Viktor",Swiss med. wkly,157,22

Stakeholder engagement for dementia care research has been identified as a national priority, though evaluation of engagement strategies and their impact has been limited. In dementia care research, stakeholders can include individuals living with dementia, family care partners, and health and social care professionals in dementia care. A Stakeholder Advisory Council (SAC) was established to identify priorities for dementia care research that are most important to stakeholders. Strategies to build capacity for research and facilitate engagement among the SAC were used to identify the research priorities. This study describes the experiences of SAC members engaged in the research process. METHODS: To evaluate stakeholder engagement, semi-structured interviews were conducted with members of the SAC to understand their experiences and perspectives on the strategies used to facilitate engagement and build capacity for research. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed using a mixed inductive and deductive approach. Findings were presented to members of the SAC to determine whether they felt their perspectives and experiences were accurately represented. Final domains and themes presented here were approved by the SAC. RESULTS: Interviews (N = 11) were conducted with members of the SAC representing each stakeholder group; persons living with dementia (n = 2); family care partners (n = 4), and health and social care professionals in dementia care (n = 5). Ten themes were categorized into four overarching domains: accessibility, council infrastructure, values and environment, and benefits of involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this qualitative study are a resource for researchers seeking to collaborate with diverse stakeholder groups to represent their perspectives in research, including individuals living with dementia. The domains and themes identified here support the inclusion of diverse stakeholders in the research process, centering engagement and capacity building strategies around individuals living with dementia.

Limited social interaction with their peers may lead to loneliness and an increased risk of mental health among adolescents. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of Internet addiction (IA) among adolescents and analyze the influence of psychosocial factors toward the heightened risk of IA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An online survey comprising sociodemographic questionnaire, Internet Addiction Diagnostic Questionnaire (KDAI), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was distributed. Overall, a total of 2,932 adolescents (mean age, 17.38 ± 2.24 years old; female, 78.7%), originating from 33 of 34 provinces in Indonesia, completed the survey. Results: The point prevalence of IA among Indonesian adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak was 19.3%. Increased Internet use duration, internalization, externalization, low prosocial behavior, and sleep disturbances were found as risk factors of IA, either directly or as mediating variables. Physical distancing, large-scale social restriction (PSBB), and health status were not correlated to IA. Discussion: Physical distancing was not established as a risk of IA. This could be due to other psychological factors such as internalization, externalization, prosocial, and sleep problems that had correlations to IA occurrence among adolescents in the COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep impairment might have resulted from the emotional and behavioral issues and directly contributed to IA development. Conclusion: The present study found the prevalence of IA among Indonesian adolescents to be higher than the adult during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several psychological measures were indicated to increase the risk of IA, while physical distancing did not elevate the risk. Thus, remote schooling is preferable in Indonesia along with proper parental supervision to minimize Internet use for entertainment purposes.","Siste, Kristiana; Hanafi, Enjeline; Sen, Lee Thung; Murtani, Belinda Julivia; Christian, Hans; Limawan, Albert Prabowo; Siswidiani, Levina Putri; Adrian,",Front Psychiatry,157,20

Autophagy involves the sequestration of endogenous or foreign components from the cytosol within double-membraned vesicles and the delivery of their content to the lysosomes for degradation. As part of innate immune responses, this autophagic elimination of foreign components is selective and requires specialized cargo receptors that function as links between a tagged foreign component and the autophagic machinery. Pathogens have evolved ways to evade their autophagic degradation to promote their replication, and recent research has shown autophagic receptors to be an important and perhaps previously overlooked target of viral autophagy inhibition.

Their increased transmissibility and higher viral load put them in the spotlight. Much has been investigated on the ability of those new variants to evade antibody recognition. However, not enough attention has been given to pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses during the natural course of infection by new lineages. Methods In this work, we investigated the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes from the main variants of concern and the potential of associated mutations to trigger or hinder CD8+ T-cells response. We also estimated the population’s coverage of these different lineages, considering peptide binding predictions to class I HLA alleles from 29 countries to investigate differences in the fraction of individuals expected to respond to a given epitope set from new and previous lineages. Results We observed a lower populational coverage for 20B/S.484K (P.2 lineage) in contrast to an increased coverage found for 20H/501Y.V2 (B.1.351 Lineage) and 20J/501Y.V3 (P.1 lineage) compared to a reference lineage. Moreover, mutations such as Spike N501Y and Nucleocapsid T205I were predicted to have an overall higher affinity through HLA-I than the reference sequence. Conclusions In summary, the data in this work provided evidence for the existence of potentially immunogenic and conserved epitopes across new SARS-CoV-2 variants, but also highlights the reduced populational’s coverage for the Brazilian lineage P.2, suggesting its potential to evade from CD8+ T-cell responses. Our results also may guide efforts to characterize and validate relevant peptides to trigger CD8+ T-cell responses, and design new universal T-cell-inducing vaccine candidates that minimize detrimental effects of viral diversification and at the same time induce responses to a broad human population.","Pretti, Marco Antonio M.; Galvani, Rômulo G.; Farias, Alessandro S; Boroni, Mariana",bioRxiv,157,16

COVID-19-induced coagulopathy (CIC) is commonly encountered at presentation manifested by considerable elevation of D-dimer and fibrin split products but with modest or no change in activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time. CIC is a complex process that is distinctly different from conventional sepsis-induced coagulopathy. The cytokine storm induced by COVID-19 infection appears to be more severe in COVID-19, resulting in development of extensive micro- and macrovascular thrombosis and organ failure. Unlike conventional sepsis, anticoagulation plays a key role in the treatment of COVID-19, however without practice guidelines tailored to these patients.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 110 million individuals and led to 2.5 million deaths worldwide. As more individuals are vaccinated, the clinical performance and utility of SARS-CoV-2 serology platforms needs to be evaluated. METHODS. The ability of four commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology platforms to detect previous infection or vaccination were evaluated using a cohort of 53 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients, 89 SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated healthcare workers (Pfizer or Moderna), and 127 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. Serology results were compared to a cell based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PSV) neutralizing antibodies assay. RESULTS. The Roche S-(spike) antibody and Diazyme neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) assays detected adaptive immune response in 100.0% and 90.1% of vaccinated individuals who received two-doses of vaccine (initial and booster), respectively. The Roche N-(nucleocapsid) antibody assay and Diazyme IgG assay did not detect adaptive immune response in vaccinated individuals. The Diazyme Nabs assay correlated with the PSV SARS-CoV-2 ID50 neutralization titers (R(2)= 0.70), while correlation of the Roche S-antibody assay was weaker (R(2)= 0.39). Median PSV SARS-CoV-2 ID50 titers more than doubled in vaccinated individuals who received two-doses of the Moderna vaccine (ID50: 597) compared to individuals that received a single dose (ID50: 284). CONCLUSIONS. The Roche S-antibody and Diazyme NAbs assays robustly detected adaptive immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals and SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. The Diazyme NAbs assay strongly correlates with the PSV SARS-CoV-2 NAbs in vaccinated individuals. Understanding the reactivity of commercially available serology platforms is important when distinguishing vaccination response versus natural infection.","Suhandynata, Raymond T.; Bevins, Nicholas J.; Tran, Jenny T.; Huang, Deli; Hoffman, Melissa A.; Lund, Kyle; Kelner, Michael J.; McLawhon, Ronald W.; Gonias, Steven L.; Nemazee, David; Fitzgerald, Robert L.",medRxiv,157,23

Yet while research shows that social media can be an effective platform for connecting individuals socially and fostering social support exchanges, both the platforms and the support exchanged therein have been mired in considerable controversies regarding their use as a tool for positive social engagement. The goal of this study is to qualitatively evaluate longitudinal changes to social media engagement during social distancing recommendations and orders to shelter-in-place. To do this, we collected longitudinal, qualitative survey data from a group of adults over the eight weeks during which most states had issued orders to shelter-in-place. We analyze data for evidence of social connection, stress reduction, and support exchange, and evaluate the impact of online social ties on staying informed and on compliance with CDC recommendations and shelter-in-place orders. Results showed a clear longitudinal evolution of users’ online social engagement. Early use was characterized by agentic purposeful engagement, information sharing, and community resource mobilization. However, over time these patterns gave way to more passive use characterized by listlessness, contentiousness and misinformation as the pandemic wore on in weeks. As social media comes to occupy an increasingly important role in the exchange of information (and misinformation) this study has important implications for the health of users and the role of social media in future disasters, including how social media impacts both stress and health related behaviors.","Mikal, Jude P.; Wurtz, Rebecca; Grande, Stuart W.",Comput Hum Behav Rep,157,20

To understand the COVID-19 outbreak in China and provide potential lessons for other parts of the world, in this study we apply a mathematical model with multiple datasets to estimate the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the severity of the illness associated with the infection, and how both were affected by unprecedented control measures. Our analyses show that before 19th January 2020, 3.5% (95% CI 1.7–8.3%) of infected people were detected; this percentage increased to 36.6% (95% CI 26.1–55.4%) thereafter. The basic reproduction number (R(0)) was 2.33 (95% CI 1.96–3.69) before 8th February 2020; then the effective reproduction number dropped to 0.04(95% CI 0.01–0.10). This estimation also indicates that control measures taken since 23rd January 2020 affected the transmissibility about 2 weeks after they were introduced. The confirmed case fatality rate is estimated at 9.6% (95% CI 8.1–11.4%) before 15 February 2020, and then it reduced to 0.7% (95% CI 0.4–1.0%). This shows that SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly transmissible but may be less severe than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. We found that at the early stage, the majority of R(0) comes from undetected infectious people. This implies that successful control in China was achieved through reducing the contact rates among people in the general population and increasing the rate of detection and quarantine of the infectious cases.","Zhang, Xu-Sheng; Vynnycky, Emilia; Charlett, Andre; De Angelis, Daniela; Chen, Zhengji; Liu, Wei",Sci Rep,157,1

We hypothesize that the institutions underlying economic freedom affect the mix of diseases by reducing diseases of poverty relative to diseases of commerce (those associated with free movement of people, such as smallpox or COVID-19). We focus on smallpox and typhoid fever in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century in order to build on recent work that make arguments similar to ours, especially the framework Werner Troesken sets forth in The Pox of Liberty. Our evidence shows that economic freedom, in multiple periods of time and settings prior to the eradication of smallpox in the second half of the twentieth century, reduced typhoid mortality but had no effect on smallpox deaths. The implication for COVID-19 is that the trade-off between fighting the pandemic and preserving economic freedom may not be too severe in the short run. However, in the long run, the wealth benefits from economic freedom are likely to be crucial in reducing vulnerability to diseases of commerce primarily from their impact on comorbidities (such as diabetes and heart disease). Thus, economic freedom is on balance good for public health, which suggests that it, while requiring trade-offs, might be the best institutional bundle for dealing with pandemics.

We aimed to reveal diagnostic clues of headache for COVID-19 infection and to investigate the course of primary headaches during the pandemic. METHODS: We developed a detailed web-based questionnaire screening the characteristics and course of headaches besides clinical COVID-19 features. The participants were grouped according to being diagnosed with COVID-19 infection or not, and having previous or new-onset headaches. The COVID-19 related headache features and their associations with other clinical features were investigated. A binary logistic regression model was performed to differentiate the characteristics of headache related to COVID-19. FINDINGS: A total of 3458 participants (2341 females;67.7%, 1495 healthcare workers;43.2%) with a mean age of 43.21 ± 11.2 years contributed to the survey. Among them, 262 participants had COVID-19 diagnosis and 126 (48.1%) were male. The rate of males in the group without COVID-19 was 31% (991 out of 3196 participants) showing significant gender difference between groups (p < 0.000). COVID-19 related headaches were more closely associated with anosmia/ageusia and gastrointestinal complaints (p < 0.000 and p < 0.000), and showed different characteristics like pulsating, pressing, and even stabbing quality. Logistic regression analyses showed that bilateral headache, duration over 72 h, analgesic resistance and having male gender were significant variables to differentiate COVID-19 positive patients from those without COVID-19 (p = 0.04 for long duration and p < 0.000 for others). A worsening of previous primary headaches due to the pandemic-related problems was not reported in the majority of patients. INTERPRETATION: Bilateral, long-lasting headaches, resistance to analgesics and having male gender were more frequent in people with COVID-19 in conjunction with anosmia/ageusia and gastrointestinal complaints. These features may be helpful for diagnosing the headache related to COVID-19 during the pandemic.","Uygun, Özge; Ertaş, Mustafa; Ekizoğlu, Esme; Bolay, Hayrunnisa; Özge, Aynur; Kocasoy Orhan, Elif; Çağatay, Arif Atahan; Baykan, Betül",J Headache Pain,157,33

We evaluated a similar vaccine approach for preventing a chronic latent genital infection rather than an acute respiratory infection. We used animal models to compare an HSV-2 trivalent nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine with the same antigens prepared as proteins with an emphasis on antigen-specific memory B cell responses and immune correlates of protection. In guinea pigs, serum neutralizing antibody titers were higher at one month and declined far less by eight months in mRNA- than protein-immunized animals. Both vaccines protected against death and genital lesions when infected one month after immunization; however, protection was more durable in the mRNA than protein group when infected after eight months, an interval representing >15% of the animal's lifespan. Serum and vaginal neutralizing antibody titers correlated with protection against infection as measured by genital lesions and vaginal virus titers two days post infection. In mice, the mRNA vaccine generated more antigen-specific memory B cells than the protein vaccine at early times post immunization that persisted for up to one year. High neutralizing titers and robust B cell immune memory likely explain the more durable protection by the HSV-2 mRNA vaccine.","Awasthi, Sita; Knox, James J; Desmond, Angela; Alameh, Mohamad-Gabriel; Gaudette, Brian T; Lubinski, John M; Naughton, Alexis; Hook, Lauren M; Egan, Kevin P; Tam, Ying K; Pardi, Norbert; Allman, David; Luning Prak, Eline T; Cancro, Michael P; Weissman, Drew; Cohen, Gary H; Friedman, Harvey M",J. clin. invest,157,26

Importantly, the emerging of immune evasion SARS-CoV-2 variants and the limited effect of current antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 in clinical trials suggested that alternative strategies in addition to the conventional vaccines and antivirals is required to successfully control the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we propose to use liquid-repellent coatings to prevent the spread of disease in the absence of effective vaccines, anti-microbial agents or therapeutics, wherein the deposition and penetration of pathogen droplets are prohibited. We use SARS-CoV-2 as a model pathogen and find that SARS-CoV-2 remnants are reduced by seven orders of magnitude on coated surfaces, yielding a repelling efficacy far outperforming the inactivation rate of disinfectants. The SARS-CoV-2 remnant scales exponentially with the liquid/solid adhesion, uncovering the mechanism and effective means for minimizing pathogen attachment. The anti-pathogen coating that both repels and inactivates pathogens is demonstrated by incorporating the super-liquid-repellent coating with anti-pathogen additives. Together with its versatility over a wide range of substrates and pathogens, the novel anti-pathogen coating is of considerable value for infection control in everyday life as well as during pandemics.","Li, Wei; Wang, Yixin; Tang, Xin; Yuen, Terrence Tsz-Tai; Han, Xing; Li, Jiaqian; Huang, Nan; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Chu, Hin; Wang, Liqiu",Mater Today Bio,157,12

Serological surveillance is the common monitoring method used in laboratory animals. A rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective high-throughput Luminex xMAP assay could be an attractive alternative to labor-intensive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. In this study, recombinant proteins from rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus and rabbit rotavirus and whole viral lysates of Sendai virus were used as coating antigens in an xMAP assay for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against these pathogens. The xMAP assay showed high specificity, with no cross-reaction with other pathogens. The coefficient of variation for intra-assay and inter-assay comparisons was less than 3% and 4%, respectively, indicating good repeatability and stability of the assay. The xMAP assay exhibited similar limits of detection for rabbit hemorrhagic virus and Sendai virus and was less sensitive for the detection of rabbit rotavirus when compared with commercial ELISA kits. A total of 52 clinical samples were tested simultaneously using both the xMAP assay and ELISA kits. The results obtained using these two methods were 100% coincident. In summary, the novel xMAP assay offers an alternative choice for rapid and sensitive high-throughput detection of antibodies in rabbit serum and can be used as a daily monitoring tool for laboratory animals.

RESULTS: Two-thousand-seven-hundred-ninety-eight subjects participated. Only 0.25% of the sample was positive to the virus. Sense of fatigue (8.19%), headache (7.81%) and sore throat (7.32%) were the most common symptoms. A statistically significant trend across the areas with a different prevalence of COVID-19 was observed related to the number of signs/symptoms (areas z = 6.38 p < 0.01). Overall, 90.55% of the sample used protective glasses or visor, 90.10% disposable gloves and 82.80% surgical mask. Regarding the confidence to avoid the infection, a statistically significant difference was found among dental hygienists belonging to the 3 years-professional-experiences groups who worked in the high COVID-19 prevalence area.

We present our experience in recently vaccinated patients over a 30-day time frame. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Tertiary otology ambulatory practice. PATIENTS: All patients with available diagnostic codes, COVID-19 questionnaires and clinical notes. INTERVENTIONS: Observational recordings. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Within the same 30-day time period in 2019, 2020, and 2021, 1.6, 2.4, and 3.8% respectively, of all office visits were for patients with the diagnosis of new onset idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) without other underlying otologic diagnoses. In this time frame in 2021, 30 patients out of the 1,325 clinical visits had new or significantly exacerbated otologic symptoms that began shortly after COVID-19 vaccination. Specifically, 18 patients received Moderna and 12 patients received Pfizer vaccine. Their mean age was 60.9±13.8 years old; 11 were women and 19 men. The mean onset of symptoms was 10.18 ± 9 days post-vaccination. Symptoms included 25 patients (83.3%) with hearing loss, 15 (50%) with tinnitus, eight (26.7%) with dizziness, and five (16.7%) with vertigo. Eleven patients had previous otologic diagnoses, including six patients with Menière's disease, two with autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED), and three having both. CONCLUSIONS: There are no definite correlations to the COVID-19 pandemic or vaccination and new or worsened otologic symptoms. Vaccinated patients with new or exacerbated otologic symptoms should be promptly referred for evaluation.

The loss of immune tolerance in SLE patients contributes to the production of autoantibodies that attack multiple organs and tissues, such as the skin, joints, and kidneys. Immune cells play important roles in the occurrence and progression of SLE through amplified immune responses. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), an NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase, has been shown to be a pivotal regulator in various physiological processes, including cell differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, aging, and immune responses, via modulation of different signaling pathways, such as the nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells and activator protein 1 pathways. Recent studies have provided evidence that SIRT1 could be a regulatory element in the immune system, whose altered functions are likely relevant to SLE development. This review aims to illustrate the functions of SIRT1 in different types of immune cells and the potential roles of SIRT1 in the SLE pathogenesis and its therapeutic perspectives.","Qiu, Yueqi; Zhou, Xingyu; Liu, Yu; Tan, Siqi; Li, Yaping",Front Immunol,157,1

In this perspective, we have explored three major targets namely; SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, and 3CL or Mpro Protease for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. These targets have attracted attention of the medicinal chemists working on computer-aided drug design in developing new small molecules that might inhibit these targets for combating COVID-19 disease. Moreover, we have compared the similarity of these target proteins with earlier reported coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We have observed that both the coronaviruses share around 80% similarity in their amino acid sequence. The key amino acid interactions which can play a crucial role in designing new small molecule inhibitors against COVID-19 have been reported in this perspective.

For each ligand, we create a custom-made focused library of covalent analogs. We use covalent docking, to dock these tailored covalent libraries and to find those that can bind covalently to a nearby cysteine while keeping some of the main interactions of the original molecule. We found ~11,000 cysteines in close proximity to a ligand across 8,386 protein-ligand complexes in the PDB. Of these, the protocol identified 1,553 structures with covalent predictions. In prospective evaluation against a panel of kinases, five out of nine predicted covalent inhibitors showed IC50 between 155 nM - 4.2 μM. Application of the protocol to an existing SARS-CoV-1 Mpro reversible inhibitor led to a new acrylamide inhibitor series with low micromolar IC50 against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The docking prediction was validated by 11 co-crystal structures. This is a promising lead series for COVID-19 antivirals. Together these examples hint at the vast number of covalent inhibitors accessible through our protocol.","Zaidman, Daniel; Gehrtz, Paul; Filep, Mihajlo; Fearon, Daren; Prilusky, Jaime; Duberstein, Shirly; Cohen, Galit; Owen, David; Resnick, Efrat; Strain-Damerell, Claire; Lukacik, Petra; Barr, Haim; Walsh, Martin A.; von Delft, Frank; London, Nir",bioRxiv,157,16

BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 pandemic brought additional stress to families. The pandemic could be particularly difficult for parents experiencing parental burnout, a condition that involves four dimensions: an overwhelming sense of exhaustion, emotional distancing from the child, saturation or a loss of fulfillment with the parental role, and a sharp contrast between how parents used to be and how they see themselves now. METHOD: A quasi‐longitudinal research design was adopted, comparing two cross‐sectional studies among Portuguese parents (N = 995), with an interval of 2 years between each wave of data collection. Participants were surveyed voluntarily through an online questionnaire located on the institutional web platform of the universities involved in the study. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to take into account the associations among variables, alongside controlling the possible confounding effects. RESULTS: Parents have overall higher parental burnout scores in Wave 2 than Wave 1, with increased exhaustion, emotional distancing, and contrast, but decreased saturation. Although parental burnout levels remain higher for mothers across the two Waves, the growth is greater for fathers than for mothers. CONCLUSION: Reconciling childcare with paid work is a stressful and new experience for many fathers. However, results suggest that even amid a crisis, some parents had the opportunity to deeply bond with their children. IMPLICATIONS: We expect this work to encourage stakeholders to consider proper intervention strategies to address potential parental burnout. Also, initiatives that strengthen gender equity within parenting context are needed.","Aguiar, Joyce; Matias, Marisa; Braz, Ana Carolina; César, Filipa; Coimbra, Susana; Gaspar, Maria Filomena; Fontaine, Anne Marie",Fam Relat,157,29

Heterogeneity in transmission risk is a known phenomenon in infectious diseases and was also seen in SARS and MERS outbreaks since 2003. The pandemic has led countries to control the pandemic spread using unprecedented severe mitigation strategies that include quarantine and lock-down. This has has been highly successful in terms of halting the spread, but had enormous socioeconomic cost. We set out to theoretically explore whether a model that includes the phenomenon of superspreaders may guide us towards a cost-effective mitigation strategy. Methods: We developed an agent-based model that includes persons that spread the disease far more readily than other persons. This allow us to investigate effect of containment strategies in both a random SEIR like scenario, and in a transmission model that work with structured society. Our model considered even contact patterns in three settings: home, work and a category of ""other"" settings representing diffuse social contacts. We introduced superspreaders either as a fixed proportion of the population, or as a broad spectrum of infectivity. For each choice, the model was then calibrated to an overall realistic daily growth rate of 23 percentage. As sensitivity analyses we varied the fraction of superspreaders as well the distribution of their infectivity. To compare the simulation findings for each mitigation scenario we considered the maximum daily ICU utility. Results: As expected, without mitigation imposed, the inclusion of superspreaders does not meaningfully change the epidemic trajectory. However when introducing mitigation strategies imposed on each of the three settings, we find that the presence of superspreaders made a substantial difference. The simulations demonstrate that the best strategy is to focus on limiting contacts in the other category. This in particular suggests that limiting diffuse social contacts in settings such as bars, transportation, restaurants, parties, concerts and lecture halls is far more effective than limiting the same amount of contact events in the home and work setting. Conclusions: To appreciate effect of heterogeneity in various social spheres we need to rethink disease transmission models. Doing so, we found that wide distribution of infectivity favours strategies that reduces the max, while leaving the typical behaviour undisturbed. We found that most workplaces may be opened without much influence on the epidemic, while one could snuff out transmission with an effective avoidance of other contacts. Interestingly, including a consideration of superspreaders can help explain the dramatic success of even moderate lock-down strategies as that practiced in Denmark and Sweden. And it points to the need to avoid mass gatherings until either flock immunity has been achieved or an effective vaccine is available.","Sneppen, K.; Simonsen, L.",,157,1

This population experiences a higher proportion of respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses than the general population and has been shown to have a high morbidity and mortality in relation to COVID-19. Methods We examined the number of hospital discharges to all Welsh adult care homes and the subsequent outbreaks of COVID-19 occurring over an 18 week period 22 February and 27 June 2020. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the impact of time-dependent exposure to hospital discharge on the incidence of the first known outbreak, over a window of 7-21 days after discharge, and adjusted for care home characteristics (including size, type of provision and health board). Results A total of 1068 care homes were monitored; 330 homes experienced an outbreak of COVID-19, and 511 homes received a discharge from hospital over the study period. The exposure to discharge from hospital was not associated with a significant increase in the risk of a new outbreak (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% CI 0.89, 1.49, p = 0.28), after adjusting for care home size, which was by far the most significant predictor. Hazard ratios (95% CI) in comparison to homes of <10 residents were: 3.4 (2.0, 5.8) for 10-24 residents; 8.3 (5.0, 13.8) for 25-49 residents; and 17.3 (9.6, 31.1) for homes of 50+ residents. When stratified for care home size, the outbreak rates were very similar for periods when homes were exposed to a hospital discharge, in comparison to periods when homes were unexposed. Conclusion Our analyses showed that large homes were at considerably greater risk of outbreaks throughout the epidemic, and after adjusting for care home size, a discharge from hospital was not associated with a significant increase in risk.

Most regimens utilize rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, which may affect the clinical course of novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)]. Here we describe the first case of mild COVID-19 during ongoing oncological treatment without significant deterioration after rituximab administration. CASE SUMMARY: A 74-year-old female with an enlargement of her right palatine tonsil was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma following tonsillectomy and started immunochemotherapy according to the rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone regimen. At home before the fourth cycle, she developed nonspecific symptoms (excessive fatigue, loss of appetite and nausea), misdiagnosed as adverse effects of chemotherapy. Unexpectedly, interim positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan, performed shortly before rituximab administration, revealed previously nonexistent pulmonary changes, potentially of infectious etiology. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by a nasopharyngeal swab (with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test) performed the following day. Despite rituximab infusion, the patient remained oligosymptomatic and was discharged home for self-isolation. Having reached a negative SARS-CoV-2 status before the subsequently scheduled regimen, the patient successfully received six cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone and obtained complete remission by positron emission tomography-computed tomography. CONCLUSION: Our case shows that rituximab-based immunotherapy due to follicular lymphoma may have no evident negative effect on the COVID-19 clinical course.","Łącki, Stanisław; Wyżgolik, Kinga; Nicze, Michał; Georgiew-Nadziakiewicz, Sylwia; Chudek, Jerzy; Wdowiak, Kamil",World J Clin Cases,157,16

A role for cytokine storm and therapeutic immunomodulation in a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 was proposed early in the pandemic. The concept of cytokine storm in COVID-19 has been criticised, given the lack of clear definition and relatively modest cytokinaemia (which may be necessary for viral clearance) compared with acute respiratory distress syndrome and bacterial sepsis. Here we consider the arguments for and against the concept of cytokine storm in COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: Several criteria have been proposed to identify the subgroup of COVID-19 patients exhibiting a cytokine storm. The beneficial effects of corticosteroids and interleukin-6 inhibition suggest that inflammation is a modifiable pathogenic component of severe COVID-19. The presence of genetic polymorphisms and pathogenic auto-autoantibodies in severe COVID-19 also suggests a significant contribution of immune dysregulation to poor outcomes. SUMMARY: Hyperinflammation is a key component of severe COVID-19, residing underneath the cytokine storm umbrella term, associated with poor outcomes.

Using dynamic causal modelling, we evaluated the contribution of all combinations of these three mechanisms using Bayesian model comparison. We found overwhelming evidence for the combination of all mechanisms, when explaining 16 types of data. Quantitatively, there was clear evidence for an increase in transmission strength of 57% over the past months (e.g., due to viral mutation), in the context of increased contact rates (e.g., rebound from national lockdowns) and increased test rates (e.g., due to the inclusion of lateral flow tests). Models with fluctuating transmission strength outperformed models with fluctuating contact rates. However, the best model included all three mechanisms suggesting that the resurgence during the second peak can be explained by an increase in effective contact rate that is the product of a rebound of contact rates following a national lockdown and increased transmission risk due to viral mutation.","Friston, K.; Costello, A.; Flandin, G.; Razi, A.",,157,11

Exploratory correlations and t-tests were used to examine potential associations between CEFIS scores and demographic, medical, and access characteristics. Qualitative data from the CEFIS were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Scores on the Exposure, Impact, and Distress subscales demonstrated significant variability. Demographic associations with Exposure differed for those with higher Impact and Distress (e.g., White, non-Hispanic/Latino AYA reported higher rates of exposure [p = .001]; AYA who identified with a minoritized racial/ethnic identity reported greater impact [p ≤ .03]). Impacts to mental and behavioral health (n = 44), interference with medical care (n = 28), and interpersonal challenges (n = 27) were the most commonly occurring qualitative themes. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings implicate differential impacts to individuals with SB and their families based on demographic, medical, and systemic factors (e.g., minoritized status). Recommendations to support families with SB and other pediatric conditions are made.","Stiles-Shields, Colleen; Kritikos, Tessa K; Ridosh, Monique M; Starnes, Meredith; Holmbeck, Grayson N",J Pediatr Psychol,157,32

Daily injections of CsA (50 mg/kg) inhibited the expression of the MHV3-induced ependymitis, meningitis, hydrocephalus and vasculitis. The effect was preserved even if CsA treatment was initiated 15 days after virus infection but was lost if CsA treatment was given later on or for a shorter period of time. Viral titers in brains of chronically infected mice were not affected by CsA treatment. During the first week following MHV3 infection, CsA treatment increased both the percentage of acute death (31 vs. 10%) and the viral titers in brain and liver of infected mice. In this model, the timing of CsA treatment appeared critical for the balance between its beneficial effect on CNS lesions and the risk of increased acute mortality.","Boespflug, O.; Godfraind, C.; Tardieu, M.",Journal of Neuroimmunology,157,26

The potential impact of pandemic influenza on the safety of the blood supply should be small because of the limited viremia and the nature of respiratory tract infection of influenza viruses. However, the potential impact of pandemic influenza on the availability of the blood supply could be significant because of reduced donation from blood donors and reduced staff capacity at blood centers during a pandemic. On the other hand, there could be reduced hospital admissions and reduced transfusions, at least for certain blood products, which should result in reduced demand for blood products. Studies are needed to further assess the likely impact of a pandemic on the blood supply and also of the possible intervention options.","Zou, Shimian",Transfus Med Rev,157,32

Although the efficiency of the HCQ is controversial, adverse effects such as QTc prolongation is still considered to be major concern due to causing potential life-threatening cardiac rhythm problem. More specifically, concurrent use of HCQ with antipsychotics which known to be a potential risk factor for QTc prolongation another important issue that needs to be addressed. The aim of the present study is to explore the potential QTc prolongation side effect of HCQ when used concurrently with antipsychotics in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and covid19 infection. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective file analysis study in patients followed up inpatient psychiatric unit for Covid19 schizophrenia patients. 25 schizophrenia patients with covid19 infection electrocardiographic data were analyzed retrospectively during the follow-up period. Before initiation of the HCQ treatment, during and after the HCQ treatment, all the electrocardiographic data were analyzed a daily basis. Electrocardiographic measurements were made on the day before HCQ treatment, during the 5-day treatment period and for 7 days after treatment cessation. QTc intervals of 470 ms (females) and 450 ms (males) were considered borderline, longer QTc intervals were considered pathological. More than 500 ms prolongation in the QTc interval was considered to be a life-threatening situation. The current antipsychotic dose was applied by 50% less to prevent Qtc prolongation before the start of COVID 19 treatment, during the 5-day treatment period and for 7 days following treatment discontinuation. Result(s): According to the data analysis, QTc intervals were found to be exceeding the borderline limit between the day of 3rd and 5th of the HCQ treatment and on the first day of HCQ discontinuation compare to before HCQ (p values< 0.05). Since the borderline limits of prolongation in the QT interval are different in men and women, these two groups were evaluated separately at the next stage. While the borderline limit is 470 millisecond for women and 450 milliseconds for men, HCQ treatment just showed a significant difference on the day of the 2nd and 3rd days of the treatment period compared to before HCQ (p values<0.05). Accordingly, the difference in the QT duration according to the initial values reaches statistical significance only in women and on the 2nd and 3rd days of HCQ treatment (p values <0.05). When the data is analyzed individually, it is observed that the cases that exceed the borderline from time to time do not have a common feature in terms of drug use, clinical diagnosis, and concomitant disease, and these patients do not have any clinical signs and symptoms. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, HCQ is considered to be an effective treatment for Covid19 especially the early phase of the illness. Regarding the potential QTc prolongation, HCQ has become a potential risk factor for ventricular fibrillation and death. As a result, it was concluded that during HCQ treatment applied in Covid19 treatment, QTc prolongation may occur, antipsychotics may worsen this side effect, and dose adjustment is required [1-5].

Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV, transmission and pathogenesis of both viruses seem to be quite distinct. A remarkable feature of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is the presence of a multibasic cleavage site, which is absent in the SARS-CoV spike. The viral spike protein not only attaches to the entry receptor, but also mediates fusion after cleavage by host proteases. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike multibasic cleavage site increases infectivity on differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 entered faster into the lung cell line Calu-3, and more frequently formed syncytial cells in differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Moreover, the multibasic cleavage site increased entry speed and plasma membrane serine protease usage relative to endosomal entry using cathepsins. Blocking serine protease activity using the clinically approved drug camostat mesylate effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Our findings provide novel information on how SARS-CoV-2 enters relevant airway cells and highlight serine proteases as an attractive antiviral target. Significance Statement Highly pathogenic coronaviruses have spilled from animals to humans three times in the past two decades. Late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China and was declared a pandemic by March 2020. The other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, emerged in 2002 and 2012, respectively, but did not attain sustained human-to-human transmission. Given the high diversity of coronaviruses in animals, urbanization and increased air travel, future coronavirus pandemics are likely to occur intermittently. Identifying which factors determine pandemic potential and pathogenicity are therefore of key importance to global health. Additionally, there is an urgent need to rapidly translate fundamental knowledge to the clinic, a process that is expedited through the use of relevant cell culture systems.","Mykytyn, Anna Z.; Breugem, Tim I.; Riesebosch, Samra; Schipper, Debby; van den Doel, Petra B.; Rottier, Robbert J.; Lamers, Mart M.; Haagmans, Bart L.",bioRxiv,157,20

In humans they mainly cause respiratory tract infections, with a large spectrum of severity, from mild, self-limited infections to highly lethal forms as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Scanty data are reported for the involvement of endocrine glands in human coronaviruses, in particular SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we summarize endocrinological involvement in human coronaviruses, including data on animal coronaviruses. Avians, ferrets and bovine are affected by specific coronavirus syndromes, with variable involvement of endocrine glands. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a target receptor, so ACE2 plays a central role in viral transmission and initial organ involvement. Autoptic studies on SARS patients revealed that thyroid, parathyroid, pituitary gland, endocrine pancreas and especially adrenals and testis could be impaired by different mechanisms (direct damage by SARS-CoV, inflammation, vascular derangement and autoimmune reactions) and few clinical studies have evidenced functional endocrine impairment. Only few data are available for COVID-19 and gonads and endocrine pancreas seem to be involved.

At least four kinds of swine enteric CoVs have been identified, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and the emerging HKU2-like porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV). The small intestines, particularly the jejunum and ileum, are the most common targets of these four CoVs in vivo, and co-infections by these CoVs are frequently observed in clinically infected pigs. This study was conducted to investigate the susceptibility of the porcine ileum epithelial cell line, IPI-2I, to different swine enteric CoVs. We found that IPI-2I cells are highly susceptible to TGEV, PDCoV, and PEAV, as demonstrated by cytopathic effect and virus multiplication. However, only a small number of cells could be infected by PEDV, possibly due to the heterogeneity of IPI-2I cells. A homogeneous cell line, designated IPI-FX, obtained from IPI-2I cells by sub-cloning with limited serial dilutions, was found to be highly susceptible to PEDV. Furthermore, IPI-FX cells were also highly susceptible to TGEV, PDCoV, as well as PEAV. Thus, this sub-cloned IPI-FX cell line is an ideal cell model to study the mechanisms of infection, particularly co-infections of swine enteric CoVs.","Wang, Xunlei; Fang, Liurong; Liu, Shudan; Ke, Wenting; Wang, Dang; Peng, Guiqing; Xiao, Shaobo",Vet Microbiol,157,19

Rapidly in the past few months, a large number of clinical studies have been initiated worldwide to find effective therapeutics, vaccines, and preventive strategies. In this study, we aim to understand the landscape of COVID-19 clinical research and identify the gaps and issues that may cause difficulty in recruitment and the lack of population representativeness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 2,034 COVID-19 studies registered in the largest public registry - ClinicalTrials.gov. Leveraging natural language processing, descriptive analysis, association analysis, and clustering analysis, we characterized COVID-19 clinical studies by phase and design features. Particularly, we analyzed their eligibility criteria to understand: (1) whether they considered the reported underlying health conditions that may lead to severe illnesses, and (2) if these studies excluded older adults, either explicitly or implicitly, which may reduce the generalizability of these studies in older adults. RESULTS: The 5 most frequently tested drugs are Hydroxychloroquine (N=148), Azithromycin (N=46), Tocilizumab (N=29), Lopinavir (N=20), and Ritonavir (N=20). Most trials did not have an upper age limit and did not exclude patients with common chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes that are prevalent in older adults. However, known risk factors that may lead to severe illnesses have not been adequately considered by existing studies. CONCLUSIONS: A careful examination of the registered COVID-19 clinical studies can identify the research gaps and inform future COVID-19 trial design towards balanced internal validity and generalizability.","He, Zhe; Erdengasileng, Fnu; Luo, Xiao; Xing, Aiwen; Charness, Neil; Bian, Jiang",medRxiv,157,1

Through systematic review and meta-analysis, we assess the effectiveness of specific interleukin inhibitors for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched on 7 January 2021 to identify studies of immunomodulatory agents (anakinra, sarilumab, siltuximab and tocilizumab) for the treatment of COVID-19. The primary outcomes were severity on an Ordinal Scale measured at day 15 from intervention and days to hospital discharge. Key secondary endpoints included overall mortality. RESULTS: 71 studies totalling 22 058 patients were included, 6 were randomised trials. Most studies explored outcomes in patients who received tocilizumab (60/71). In prospective studies, tocilizumab was associated with improved unadjusted survival (risk ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96, I(2)=0.0%), but conclusive benefit was not demonstrated for other outcomes. In retrospective studies, tocilizumab was associated with less severe outcomes on an Ordinal Scale (generalised OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.64, I(2)=98%) and adjusted mortality risk (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.66, I(2)=76.6%). The mean difference in duration of hospitalisation was 0.36 days (95% CI −0.07 to 0.80, I(2)=93.8%). There was substantial heterogeneity in retrospective studies, and estimates should be interpreted cautiously. Other immunomodulatory agents showed similar effects to tocilizumab, but insufficient data precluded meta-analysis by agent. CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab was associated with a lower relative risk of mortality in prospective studies, but effects were inconclusive for other outcomes. Current evidence for the efficacy of anakinra, siltuximab or sarilumab in COVID-19 is insufficient, with further studies urgently needed for conclusive findings.

Respondents will be randomly assigned to perform prosocial, self-focused, or neutral behaviors each week. Two weeks after the intervention, a final survey will assess whether the intervention has a lasting effect on mental health and emotional well-being.

METHODS: This study enrolled 40 patients diagnosed with steroid‐induced necrosis of the femoral head. Patients had various stages of femoral head necrosis. The differential expression of serum proteins and mRNA from patients with steroid‐induced necrosis of the femoral head (SINFH) and healthy volunteers was analyzed by western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QT‐PCR). The pathological change in osteocyte necrosis was indicated by hematoxylin and eosin stain and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Hematoxylin and eosin stain showed histopathology changes in the necrotic area of patients with steroid‐induced INFH: bone trabeculae were fewer and thinner, became broken, fragmented and structurally disordered; intraosseous adipose cells became enlarged; the arrangement of the osteoblasts became irregular; and vacant bone lacunae increased. QT‐PCR showed significantly lower levels of α‐2‐macroglobulin in the serum of patients with SINFH than in controls (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining and western blotting demonstrated that the expression of α‐2‐macroglobulin was significantly decreased in the necrotic area of SINFH patients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The α‐2‐macroglobulin may be associated with the pathology of SINFH. The multiple pathological reactions occur in SINFH and α‐2‐macroglobulin may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of SINFH or a promising therapeutic target.","Fang, Shan‐hong; Li, Yong‐feng; Jiang, Jia‐run; Chen, Peng",Orthop Surg,157,26

Due to the economic impacts of social distancing, there is growing desire to relax these measures. To characterize a range of possible strategies for control and to understand their consequences, we performed an optimal control analysis of a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Given that the pandemic is already underway and controls have already been initiated, we calibrated our model to data from the US and focused our analysis on optimal controls from May 2020 through December 2021. We found that a major factor that differentiates strategies that prioritize lives saved versus reduced time under control is how quickly control is relaxed once social distancing restrictions expire in May 2020. Strategies that maintain control at a high level until summer 2020 allow for tapering of control thereafter and minimal deaths, whereas strategies that relax control in the short term lead to fewer options for control later and a higher likelihood of exceeding hospital capacity. Our results also highlight that the potential scope for controlling COVID-19 until a vaccine is available depends on epidemiological parameters about which there is still considerable uncertainty, including the basic reproduction number and the effectiveness of social distancing. In light of those uncertainties, our results do not constitute a quantitative forecast and instead provide a qualitative portrayal of possible outcomes from alternative approaches to control.","Perkins, Alex; Espana, Guido",,157,24

We assessed whether the thirty UK universities receiving the most Medical Research Council funding in 2017–2018 complied with World Health Organization best practices for clinical trial reporting on the US Clinical Trial Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov). Firstly, we developed and evaluated a novel automated tracking tool (clinical-trials-tracker.com) for clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. This tracker identifies the number of due trials (whose completion lies more than 395 days in the past) that have not reported results on the registry and can now be used for all sponsors. Secondly, we used the tracker to determine the number of due clinical trials sponsored by the selected UK universities in October 2020. Thirdly, using the FDAAA Trials Tracker, we identified trials sponsored by these universities that are not complying with reporting requirements under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act 2007. Finally, we quantified the average and median number of days between primary completion date and results posting. In October 2020, the universities included in our study were sponsoring 1634 due trials, only 1.6% (n = 26) of which had reported results within a year of completion. 89.8% (n = 1468) of trials remained unreported, and 8.6% (n = 140) of trials reported results late. We also identified 687 trials that contained inconsistent data, suggesting that UK universities often fail to update their data adequately on ClinicalTrials.gov. The mean reporting delay after primary completion for trials that posted results was 981 days, the median 728 days. Only four trials by UK universities violated the FDAAA 2007. We suggest a number of reasons for the poor reporting performance of UK universities on ClinicalTrials.gov: (i) efforts to improve clinical trial reporting in the UK have to date focused on the European clinical trial registry (EU CTR), (ii) the absence of a tracking tool for timely reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov has limited the visibility of institutions’ reporting performance on the US registry and (iii) there is currently a lack of repercussions for UK sponsors who fail to report results on ClinicalTrials.gov which should be addressed in the future.

Because of the relative infrequency of this disease, the patterns of metastasis in MCC are understudied. METHODS: Patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (8th edition) stage I–IV MCC treated at our institution were identified (1/1/2008–2/28/2018). The first site of metastasis was classified as regional [regional lymph node (LN) basin, in-transit] or distant. Distant metastasis-free (DMFS) and MCC-specific (MSS) survival were estimated. RESULTS: Of 133 patients, 64 (48%) had stage I, 13 (10%) stage II, 48 (36%) stage III, and 8 (6%) stage IV disease at presentation. The median follow-up time in patients who remained alive was 36 (interquartile range 20–66) months. Regional or distant metastases developed in 78 (59%) patients. The first site was regional in 87%, including 73% with isolated LN involvement, and distant in 13%. Thirty-seven (28%) patients eventually developed distant disease, which most commonly involved the abdominal viscera (51%) and distant LNs (46%) first. The lung (0%) and brain (3%) were rarely the first distant sites. Stage III MCC at presentation was significantly associated with worse DMFS (hazard ratio 4.87, P = 0.001) and stage IV disease with worse MSS (hazard ratio 6.30, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Regional LN metastasis is the most common first metastatic event in MCC, confirming the importance of nodal evaluation. Distant disease spread appears to have a predilection for certain sites. Understanding these patterns could help to guide surveillance strategies.","Song, Yun; Azari, Feredun S.; Tang, Rebecca; Shannon, Adrienne B.; Miura, John T.; Fraker, Douglas L.; Karakousis, Giorgos C.",Ann Surg Oncol,157,16

They see large numbers of patients with various health problems and may be the patients’ only interaction with the medical community for symptoms resulting from infectious diseases and injuries from radiation, chemicals, and/or burns. Therefore, Internists must understand early warning signs of different bioterrorist and infectious agents, proper reporting channels and measures, various ways that they can assist the public health response, and roles of different local, state, and federal agencies. In addition, it is important to understand effects of a public health disaster on clinic operations and relevant legal consequences.","Lee, Bruce Y.",J Gen Intern Med,157,26

So far, the number of infectious cases has increased globally to more than 100 thousand and the outbreak has been defined as a pandemic situation, but there are still no “specific drug” available. Relevant reports have pointed out the novel coronavirus has 80% homology with SARS. In the difficulty where new synthesized drug cannot be applied immediately to patients, “conventional drug in new use” becomes a feasible solution. The first medication experience of the recovered patients in the US has led remdesivir to be the “specific drug”. China has also taken immediate action to put remdesivir into clinical trials with the purpose of applying it into clinical therapeutics for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We started from the structure, immunogenicity, and pathogenesis of coronavirus infections of the novel coronavirus. Further, we analyzed the pharmacological actions and previous trials of remdesivir to identify the feasibility of conducting experiments on COVID-19.","Cao, Yu-chen; Deng, Qi-xin; Dai, Shi-xue",Travel Med Infect Dis,157,20

The current article provides a detailed technological guide on how to develop a telehealth ABA parent training curriculum. Our model also includes a series of brief acceptance and commitment training (ACT) protocols to enhance parental adherence. We provide the details for replicating our telehealth model and also demonstrate its effectiveness. To begin, a step-by-step guide on how to develop this curriculum is presented, as well as protocols used in a 60-day telehealth ABA parent training program. Afterward, we describe a randomized controlled trial design to examine the effectiveness of this protocol. Thirteen families from the southern Illinois region participated in the curriculum before the COVID-19 outbreak. Obtained data indicated training was effective to teach skills, and parents with supplemental ACT material made significantly more progress than those in the control group, t(11) = 2.36, p = .038. Halfway through the training, the outbreak of COVID-19 occurred, and parents in the ACT group were more likely to continue the program, whereas parents in the control group were significantly more likely to postpone their participation, χ(2) = 6.96, p = .008. Social validity measures indicated that parents rated the curriculum favorably. Limitations and suggestions for practitioners are discussed.","Yi, Zhihui; Dixon, Mark R.",Behav Anal Pract,157,26

The presence of an abscess requires urgent drainage and specific antibiotic therapy. Patients with critical limb ischemia need revascularization and, subsequently the intervention of a plastic surgeon is often required in cases of exposure of tendons and ligaments. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a patient was refered to our department with an abscess on the dorsum of the left foot. After urgent drainage with tendon exposure, he started specific antibiotic therapy and underwent tibial vessels angioplasty. After infection healing cord blood platelet gel was applied, accelerating the healing process, with injection of its liquid part into the exposed tendons, thus retaining the vital functions of the tendons.","Massara, Mafalda; Pucci, Giulia; Stilo, Giuseppe; Alberti, Antonino; Surace, Rosangela; Foti, Giovanni; Volpe, Pietro",Regenerative medicine,157,28

Modelling decision-making and time preference for COVID-19 vaccine through a conjoint experiment approach,15.539819,4.797517,2021-06-07,"To date, the strongest predictor for dying with COVID‐19 is suffering from several chronic disorders prior to the viral infection. Pre‐existing multimorbidity is highly correlated with socioeconomic inequality. In turn, having several chronic conditions is closely linked to multiple medication intake, especially in richer countries with good access to biomedical care. Owing to its vertical structure, biomedicine often risks giving multiple treatments in an uncoordinated way. Such lack of integrated care can create complex forms of iatrogenic harm. Multimorbidity is often exacerbated by a pharmaceuticalization of social deprivation in place of integrated care. In this article, I explore the possibility that clusters of over‐medication are a contributing factor to higher death rates from COVID‐19, especially in poorer areas within richer countries. Anthropological perspectives on the social embeddedness of multimorbidity and multiple medication use can expand our understanding of who is most vulnerable to SARS‐CoV‐2.","Ecks, Stefan",Med Anthropol Q,157,1

METHODS: The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey of 307 practicing family physicians, full-time faculty physicians, and resident physicians in Kansas from December 14, 2020, to December 31, 2020. The study participants completed an anonymous, 20-item survey assessing family physicians' concerns about exposure to COVID-19 and their perceptions of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to control SARS-CoV-2. A mixed-method approach was used to collect, analyze, and interpret the data. RESULTS: There was a 51.1% response rate. The proportion of family physicians who reported their intentions to be vaccinated for COVID-19 was significantly higher than those who were hesitant to receive the mRNA vaccines (90.6% vs 9.4%; χ2 [1, n = 307] = 201.9.1; P < .0001). Among those who were willing to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, the main reasons were to prevent COVID-19 infection; protect self, family, and community; contribute to herd immunity; inspire confidence that the vaccines are safe and end the pandemic and bring life back to normal. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a significantly positive association between a physician's concerns and their willingness to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. With the authorization of 2 new mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, future studies should investigate the number of physicians in our study who received the vaccine.","Ofei-Dodoo, Samuel; Kellerman, Rick; Russell, Taylor",J Am Board Fam Med,157,24

However, the application of SPR to detect trace targets is hampered by non-specific binding and poor signal. A variety of approaches for amplification have been explored to overcome this deficiency including DNA aptamers as versatile target detection tools. Hybridization chain reaction (HCR) is a high-efficiency enzyme-free DNA amplification method operated at room temperature, in which two stable species of DNA hairpins coexist in solution until the introduction of the initiator strand triggers a cascade of hybridization events. At an optimal salt condition, as the concentrations of H1 and H2 increased, the HCR signals were enhanced, leading to signal amplification reaching up to 6.5-fold of the detection measure at 30 min. This feature enables DNA to act as an amplifying transducer for biosensing applications to provide an enzyme-free alternative that can easily detect complex DNA sequences. Improvement of more diverse recognition events can be achieved by integrating HCR with a phase-sensitive SPR (pSPR)-tested aptamer stimulus. This work seeks to establish pSPR aptamer system for highly informative sensing by means of an amplification HCR. Thus, combining pSPR and HCR technologies provide an expandable platform for sensitive biosensing.","Yang, Ching-Hsu; Wu, Tzu-Heng; Chang, Chia-Chen; Lo, Hui-Yun; Liu, Hui-Wen; Huang, Nien-Tsu; Lin, Chii-Wann",Biosensors (Basel),157,1
