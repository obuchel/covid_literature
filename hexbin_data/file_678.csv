Here, we report the first chip‐based model for Lassa hemorrhagic syndrome. The chip features a microvessel interfacing collagen network as a simple mimic for extracellular matrix, allowing for quantitative and real‐time vascular integrity assessment. Luminal infusion of Lassa virus‐like particles led to a dramatic increase in vascular permeability in a viral load‐dependent manner. Using this platform, we showed that Fibrin‐derived peptide FX06 can be used to suppress the vascular integrity loss. This simple chip‐based model proved promising in the assessment of disease severity and provides an easy‐to‐use platform for future investigation of Lassa pathogenesis and drug development in a human‐like setting.","Tang, Huaqi; Abouleila, Yasmine; Mashaghi, Alireza",Biotechnol Bioeng,678,1

Available Sirt2 inhibitors or modulators exhibit insufficient specificity and potency, and even partially contradictory Sirt2 effects were described for the available inhibitors. Herein, we applied computational screening and evaluation of FDA-approved drugs for highly selective modulation of Sirt2 activity via a unique inhibitory mechanism as reported earlier for SirReal2 inhibitor. Application of stringent molecular docking results in the identification of 48 FDA-approved drugs as selective putative inhibitors of Sirt2, but only top 10 drugs with docking scores > − 11 kcal/mol were considered in reference to SirReal2 inhibitor for computational analysis. The molecular dynamics simulations and post-simulation analysis of Sirt2-drug complexes revealed substantial stability for Fluphenazine and Nintedanib with Sirt2. Additionally, developed 3D-QSAR-models also support the inhibitory potential of drugs, which exclusively revealed highest activities for Nintedanib (pIC50 ≥ 5.90 µM). Conclusively, screened FDA-approved drugs were advocated as promising agents for Sirt2 inhibition and required in vitro investigation for Sirt2 targeted drug development.","Bharadwaj, Shiv; Dubey, Amit; Kamboj, Nitin Kumar; Sahoo, Amaresh Kumar; Kang, Sang Gu; Yadava, Umesh",Sci Rep,678,1

Special attention is focussed on the shelduck and sheldgeese (Tadornini), perching duck (Cairinini), diving duck (Aythyini), sea duck (Mergini), eiders (Somateriini) and stifftails (Oxyurini). Two kinds of response could be distinguished at Slimbridge. In one, egg‐laying began sometime in spring, when daylengths reached a stimulatory level, and continued until the corresponding daylengths in summer or autumn were reached, that is, the egg‐laying season extended symmetrically on either side of the summer solstice. This is regarded as a “primitive‐type” response and is characteristic of phylogenetic lines which are thought to have evolved in, and radiated from, the tropics; the comb duck, muscovy duck, ringed teal and southern pochard are examples. The second kind of response was characterized by the cessation of egg‐laying when daylengths still remained stimulatory, that is, a characteristic photo‐refractoriness to long days developed, and egg‐laying occurred during the first half of the year at Slimbridge. We term this a “temperate‐type” response, and examples are provided by nearly all the sheldgeese and shelduck, by the mandarin, Carolina, white‐winged wood duck and all Aythya and the sea duck. Only a few examples of apparently intermediate breeding response were noted and these transitional species are discussed, for example the Andean goose, Abyssinian blue‐winged goose and Radjah shelduck. The egg‐laying cycles can be described as entrained rhythms and their phase angles measured in relation to seasonal daylength changes at Slimbridge. In Aythya, the onset of reproductive activity was strongly correlated with the latitude of origin whereas the end of breeding was not. This was because refractoriness developed at about the same time in all species, even though they began breeding in response to different photoperiods. For this reason, the length of breeding season expressed at Slimbridge was correlated with the midlatitude of the breeding range in the wild but even more strongly with the photoperiod under which egg‐laying was initiated. The onset of breeding in the sheldgeese and perching duck was not related to latitude, perhaps because species have had time to modify their ranges. However, the end of breeding in perching duck was related to latitude. Cessation of breeding corresponds to the onset of moult and the secretion of thyroid hormones. We suggest that as waterfowl radiated to higher latitudes their “biological clocks” became entrained to the new light regimes and a host of physiological functions were ordered in an adaptive rather than competitive sequence. It is because so many biological functions are liable to compete for scarce environmental energy supplies that some kind of endogenous partitioning is necessary. This endogenous component is seen when different species are kept under standard lighting conditions. It follows that the photo‐response of a species reflects its evolutionary history and so the discussion broaches zoogeographical and taxonomic topics. For example, it seems unlikely that the white‐winged wood duck evolved in the tropics, and likely that the sheldgeese and shelduck radiated from a post‐","Murton1,†, R.

Methods: The basic characteristics, time and area distributions, clinical manifestations, epidemiological history and transmission mode of the COVID-19 cases associated with the department store exposure were analyzed. Results: A total of 40 COVID-19 cases were associated with the department store exposure, accounting for 75.47% of the total confirmed cases (53 cases) reported in Baodi district. The cases were mainly at the age of 60 years or older (35.00%) and farmers (40.00%). The main clinical manifestations included fever (95.00%), cough (35.00%), and diarrhea (15.00%). The proportion of confirmed severe cases was 32.50%. The incidence curve showed that the incidence peak occurred on 31 January, 2020. Among the 40 cases, 6(15.00%) were department store employees, 19(47.50%) were customers and 15(37.50%) were close contacts (secondary cases). The first case occurred on 21 January, 2020, this case was a department store employee who had a purchasing history at whole sale markets in other provinces and cities before the onset, and 3 employees were still on duty after symptom onsets. The median of the incubation period of customer cases was 6 days, and the median of the interval between onset and medical treatment of customer cases was 7 days. Conclusion: This was a cluster epidemic of COVID-19, which might be associated with the exposure in the department store. By now, the current prevention and control measures have achieved satisfied effects.","Wu, W S; Li, Y G; Wei, Z F; Zhou, P H; Lyu, L K; Zhang, G P; Zhao, Y; He, H Y; Li, X Y; Gao, L; Zhang, X M; Liu, H; Zhou, N; Guo, Y; Zhang, X M; Zhang, D; Liu, J; Zhang, Y",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,678,5

DESIGN Scoping review LITERATURE SEARCH: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus and Cochrane Library. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA All randomized controlled trials (RCT) that examined post-operative exercise-based interventions for total knee arthroplasty were eligible for inclusion. Studies that were multifactorial or contained exercise interventions for both hip and knee arthroplasty were also included. DATA SYNTHESIS The definition, type of measurement used and outcome for exercise adherence were collected and analyzed descreptively. Quality of reporting of exercise interventions were assessed using the Consensus for Exercise Reporting Tool (CERT) and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. RESULTS There were a total of 112 RCTs included in this review. The majority of RCTs (63%, n = 71) did not report exercise adherence. Only 23% (n = 15) of studies provided a definition of adherence. RCTs were of poor quality, with 85% (n = 95) of studies having high or unclear risk of bias. Reporting of exercise interventions was poor, with only 4 items (of 19) (21%) of the CERT adequately reported (88-99%), with other items not fulfilled on at least 60% of the RCTs. There were no RCTs that had fulfilled all the criteria for the CERT. CONCLUSION The RCTs included in this study poorly reported exercise adherence, as well as description of the post-operative TKA rehabilitation intervention. Future RCTs should use valid and reliable measures of adherence and a proper tool for reporting of exercise interventions (e.g., CERT, TiDER).

This phenomenon attributes to primary and secondary stabilities of the stems that exhibit trade-off the stem stiffness. This study attempts to ascertain the influence of stem stiffness on peri-prosthetic bone formation and stress shielding when in silico models of solid CoCr alloy and Ti alloy stems, and porous Ti stems (53.8 GPa and 31.5 GPa Young's moduli) were implanted. A tissue differentiation predictive mechanoregulation algorithm was employed to estimate the evolutionary bond between bone and stem interfaces with 0.5-mm- and 1-mm-thick calluses. The results revealed that the high stiffness stems yielded higher stress shielding and lower micromotions than that of low stiffness stems. Contrarily, bone formation around solid Ti alloy stem and porous Ti 53.8 GPa stem was augmented in 0.5-mm- and 1-mm-thick calluses, respectively. All designs of stems exhibited different rates of bone formation, diverse initial micromotions and stress shielding; however, long-term bone formation was coherent with different stress shielding. Therefore, contemplating the secondary stability of the stems, low stiffness stem (Ti 53.8 GPa) gave superior biomechanical performance than that of high stiffness stems.","Mehboob, Hassan; Ahmad, Furqan; Tarlochan, Faris; Mehboob, Ali; Chang, Seung Hwan",Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology,678,1

However, hydrochar contains greater amounts of labile fractions than traditional biochar and may exacerbate the short-term greenhouse effect. To lower the risk of greenhouse gas release due to labile fractions, optimize parameters must be determined to produce hydrochar without carbohydrate carbon. In addition, the effects of varying feedstocks and process conditions on hydrochar structure as well as its dissolved organic matter (DOM) must be investigated. Spartina alterniflora and pig manure were used to produce two hydrochars (HSAs and HPMs) and their corresponding DOM samples (DSAs and DPMs) at various production temperatures (Tp) and reaction times (tr). The carbohydrate vanishing points (CVPs) were 265 °C-1 h, 250 °C-2 h, and 245 °C-4 h for the HSAs and 260 °C-1 h, 250 °C-2 h, and 250 °C-4 h for the HPMs. With the isolation of DOM, 1.09-4.33% organic carbon of the hydrochar was released. The aromaticity of DSAs decreased with increasing Tp and tr. The molecular weights of the DSAs and DPMs decreased with increasing Tp and tr. This study uncovered hydrochar's molecular structure as well as the content and properties of its labile fractions. Results can be used to help design specific hydrochars for potential applications, based on the trend of the molecular change under the condition of the studied parameters optimization to produce hydrochar in this study.","Chen, Yalan; Sun, Ke; Sun, Haoran; Yang, Yan; Han, Lanfang; Zheng, Hao; Xing, Baoshan",The Science of the total environment,678,5

However, it may also increase the risks of prematurity. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of immediate versus deferred delivery of preterm babies with suspected fetal compromise on neonatal, maternal and long-term outcomes. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (27 February 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised trials comparing a policy of immediate delivery with deferred delivery or expectant management in preterm fetuses with suspected in utero compromise. Quasi-randomised trials and trials employing a cluster-randomised design were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently evaluated trials for inclusion into the review. Two review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. MAIN RESULTS We included one trial of 548 women (588 babies) in the review. There was no difference in the primary outcomes of extended perinatal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 2.04) or the composite outcome of death or disability at or after two years (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.75) with immediate delivery compared to deferred delivery. More babies in the immediate delivery group were ventilated for more than 24 hours (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.97). There were no differences between the immediate delivery and deferred delivery groups in any other individual neonatal morbidity or markers of neonatal morbidity (cord pH less than 7.00, Apgar less than seven at five minutes, convulsions, interventricular haemorrhage or germinal matrix haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis and periventricular leucomalacia or ventriculomegaly).More children in the immediate delivery group had cerebral palsy at or after two years of age (RR 5.88, 95% CI 1.33 to 26.02). There were, however, no differences in neurodevelopment impairment at or after two years (RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.41) or death or disability in childhood (six to 13 years of age) (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.40). More women in the immediate delivery group had caesarean delivery than in the deferred delivery group (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.24). Data were not available on any other maternal outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Currently there is insufficient evidence on the benefits and harms of immediate delivery compared with deferred delivery in cases of suspected fetal compromise at preterm gestations to make firm recommendations to guide clinical practice. Where there is uncertainty whether or not to deliver a preterm fetus with suspected fetal compromise, there seems to be no benefit to immediate delivery. Deferring delivery until test results worsen or increasing gestation favours delivery may improve the outcomes for mother and baby. More research is needed to guide clinical practice.","Stock, Sarah J; Bricker, Leanne; Norman, Jane E",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,678,24

We recently reported that treatment of primary human epithelial cells (PHBE cells) with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) enhanced RSV replication. Here, we report that the enhancement of RSV replication is mediated by induction of cell cycle arrest. These data were confirmed by using pharmacologic inhibitors of cell cycle progression, which significantly enhanced RSV replication. Our data also showed that RSV infection alone resulted in cell cycle arrest in A549 and PHBE cells. Interestingly, our data showed that RSV infection induced the expression of TGF-beta in epithelial cells. Blocking of TGF-beta with anti-TGF-beta antibody or use of a specific TGF-beta receptor signaling inhibitor resulted in rescue of the RSV-induced cell cycle arrest, suggesting an autocrine mechanism. Collectively, our data demonstrate that RSV regulates the cell cycle through TGF-beta in order to enhance its replication. These findings identify a novel pathway for upregulation of virus replication and suggest a plausible mechanism for association of RSV with immune dysregulation and asthma.","Gibbs, John D; Ornoff, Douglas M; Igo, Heather A; Zeng, Jennifer Y; Imani, Farhad",Journal of virology,678,24

Seven (7) distinct yeasts were isolated and identified using cultural, microscopy and biochemical tests (temperature tolerance, flocculation, ethanol tolerance, H2S production and killer toxin production and the ability to assimilate and ferment sugars. The yeast isolates were screened using refractometric and spectrophotometric methods to select the isolate with the best ability for wine production. This isolate was molecularly characterized, grown in 1 L of potatoes dextrose broth, freeze dried and used for wine production. The population of yeast, bacteria and the physicochemical analysis of the must were monitored during fermentation. Populations of bacteria in the wine were assessed by standard pour plate count. The proximate content and physicochemical properties of the produced wine before and after ageing, as well as the sensorial quality of the produced wine was determined. All the yeast isolates possessed the ability to flocculate, tolerate ethanol concentration of between 5 and 20% and temperature range of 30-45 °C, produced low concentration of H2S and does not produce killer toxins. A palm wine isolate, identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae X01 was selected as the best isolate with the most ability for wine production. The total yeast count increases as the period of fermentation progressed while the total viable bacterial count reduced as the fermentation period progressed. There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the physicochemical properties of the must during fermentation. At the end of the fermentation, the produced wine had 5.22% and 4.86% ethanol content for S. cerevisiae QA23 and S. cerevisiae X01 respectively. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the proximate and physicochemical compositions of the produced wine before and after ageing using Saccharomyces cerevisiae X01 when compared to the control S. cerevisiae QA23. This study revealed that the Nigerian locally sourced S. cerevisiae X01 can be used as an alternative substrate for industrial scale production of wine with a mild alcoholic content.","Oladoja, Emmanuel Olalekan; Oyewole, Oluwafemi Adebayo; Okeke, Susan Kingsley; Azuh, Victor Okechukwu; Oladoja, Olakunle Israel; Jagaba, Aliyu",Archives of microbiology,678,20

The latter technique carries a risk of complications such as pneumothorax or lead crush. Cephalic venous cut down is free of these complications but often less successful due to technical difficulties. We report a highly successful, simplified cephalic venous access with a modified Seldinger technique. METHODS We prospectively studied 221 patients undergoing de novo implantation of a one, two or three lead device system performed over a 1-year period at our centre, and assessed the efficacy of the cephalic vein access including the number of leads successfully placed for each procedure. RESULTS In 83 percent of patients undergoing CIED implantation a suitable cephalic vein was present. In respectively 98% and 99% of patients undergoing single or dual chamber CIED implantation, lead placement could be performed exclusively via the cephalic vein and in 72% of CRT implants, all three leads were placed via cephalic access.

While BIS® monitors might aid anesthetic management, unprocessed or nonproprietary electroencephalographic data may be a rich source of information for clinicians. We hypothesized that anesthesiologists, after training in electroencephalography interpretation, could estimate the index of a reference BIS as accurately as a second BIS® monitor (twin BIS®) (Covidien Medical, Boulder, CO) when provided with clinical and electroencephalographic data. METHODS Two sets of electrodes connected to two separate BIS® monitors were placed on the foreheads of 10 surgical patients undergoing general anesthesia. Electroencephalographic parameters, vital signs, and end-tidal anesthetic gas concentrations were recorded at prespecified time points, and were provided to two sets of anesthesiologists. Ten anesthesiologists received brief structured training in electroencephalograph interpretation and 10 were untrained. Although electroencephalographic waveforms and open-source processed electroencephalograph metrics were provided from the reference BIS®, both groups were blinded to BIS values and were asked to estimate BIS. RESULTS The trained anesthesiologists averaged as close to or closer to the reference BIS® compared with the twin BIS® monitor for 34% of their BIS estimates versus 26% for the untrained anesthesiologists. Using linear mixed effects model analysis, there was a statistically significant difference between the trained and untrained anesthesiologists (P = 0.02), but no difference between the twin BIS® monitor and trained anesthesiologists (P = 0.9). CONCLUSION With limited electroencephalography training and access to clinical data, anesthesiologists can estimate the BIS almost as well as a second BIS® monitor. These results reinforce the potential utility of training anesthesia practitioners in unprocessed electroencephalogram interpretation.","Bottros, Michael M; Palanca, Ben Julian A; Mashour, George A; Patel, Ami; Butler, Catherine; Taylor, Amanda; Lin, Nan; Avidan, Michael S",Anesthesiology,678,1

Nous avons voulu déterminer si de façon globale la progression de l’épidémie est associée au climat ou aux interventions de santé publique visant à réduire la transmission du coronavirus du syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère 2 (SRAS-CoV-2). MÉTHODES: Nous avons procédé à une étude de cohorte prospective des 144 régions géopolitiques de la planète (375 609 cas) présentant au moins 10 cas de COVID-19, avec transmission locale, en date du 20 mars 2020, à l’exclusion de la Chine, de la Corée du Sud, de l’Iran et de l’Italie. Par analyse de régression à effets aléatoires pondérée, nous avons évalué le lien entre la progression de l’épidémie (exprimée sous forme de rapports de taux d’incidence [RTI] comparant les nombres cumulatifs de cas de COVID-19 du 27 mars 2020 à ceux du 20 mars 2020) avec les facteurs de latitude, température, humidité, fermeture des établissements scolaires, interdiction des grands rassemblements et mesures d’éloignement social qui étaient en place les 7 et 13 mars 2020 (période de 14 jours antérieure à l’évaluation). RÉSULTATS: Les analyses univariées ont révélé aucuns lien entre la progression de l’épidémie et les facteurs de latitude et de température, mais des liens négatifs faibles avec l’humidité relative (RTI par 10 %, 0,91, intervalle de confiance [IC] de 95 % 0,85–0,96) et l’humidité absolue (RTI par 5 g/m3 0,92, IC à 95 % 0,85–0,99). Des liens étroits ont été observés avec l’interdiction des grands rassemblements (RTI 0,65, IC à 95 % 0,53–0,79), la fermeture des établissements scolaires (RTI 0,63, IC à 95 % 0,52–0,78) et les mesures d’éloignement social (RTI 0,62, IC à 95 % 0,45–0,85). Dans un modèle multivarié, on a noté un lien étroit avec le nombre de mesures déployées par la santé publique (p pour tendance = 0,001), tandis que le lien avec l’humidité absolue s’atténuait. INTERPRÉTATION: La progression de l’épidémie de COVID-19 ne s’est pas révélée en lien avec la latitude ni avec la température, mais faiblement en lien avec l’humidité relative ou absolue.

One important question emerging from this discussion of regional differences pertains to the healthcare workforce not just in absolute numbers but also in terms of skill-mix. As nurses comprise over half the skilled healthcare workforce worldwide, it is important to consider them as part of a health systems strengthening approach to quality improvement. We sought to investigate the influence of the registered nurse (RN) concentration and the impact on COVID-19 mortality between countries worldwide. METHODS We conducted an observational cohort study to examine the association between COVID-19 mortality rates and concentrations of registered nurses. Data on nursing concentrations by country provided from the World Health Organization were merged with March 2020 COVID-19 mortality rates. Descriptive statistics, geographical information systems (GIS) mapping and multilevel linear regression with mixed effects were applied to examine this association with regional clustering of countries. FINDINGS In total, 172 countries were included in the analysis. These results indicated that for every 1.0 increases in RN per 1,000 individuals in a country, there was a decrease in COVID-19 mortality of -1.98 per 1 million individuals (p=0.003). INTERPRETATION High nursing concentrations are strongly associated with reduced mortality rates of COVID-19. The key to address the needs of current and future COVID-19 outbreaks, or for that matter, any infectious disease outbreak of this magnitude is to prepare a highly trained, versatile nursing workforce.

Objective To determine whether a social media campaign, targeted at the gaps in behavior on personal hygiene and physical distancing and distributed nationwide via digital news media, may be an effective method to improve behavior and help to inhibit person-to-person transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Design, Setting, and Participants This survey study was designed to uncover self-reported gaps in behavior regarding personal hygiene and physical distancing in the Netherlands. A diagnostic survey was distributed by a large national newspaper (De Telegraaf) and a popular social influencer (Govert Sweep) on March 17, 2020, and was completed by 16 072 participants. Analysis of these outcomes showed that coughing and sneezing in the elbow was done well, but that handwashing, face touching, and physical distancing showed serious gaps compared with advised behavior. This diagnostic information was used to design infographics and a video targeted at repairing these gaps in behavior. The video and infographics were distributed on a national level on March 21, 2020, followed by a postcampaign survey to measure the results on March 24, 2020. Data analysis was performed from March to April 2020. Exposure Exposed participants were those who viewed the infographics and/or video. Main Outcomes and Measures Improvement on the extent of handwashing in all areas, handwashing duration of 20 seconds or longer, awareness on face touching, and physical distancing were measured according to responses on the postcampaign survey. Results A total of 17 189 participants (mean [SD] age, 47.61 [13.57] years; 9100 women [52.9%]) responded to the postcampaign survey. The news article in De Telegraaf was read more than 2 million times, and the influencer video was watched more than 80 000 times. Cross-sectional analysis of the postcampaign survey using logistic regression correcting for age, gender, and educational level showed that exposure to the video plus infographics (827 participants) (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.14; 95% CI, 1.83-2.50; P < .001) and to the infographics alone (11 348 participants) (adjusted OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.22-1.40; P < .001) were positively associated with washing hands in all areas compared with the unexposed group (4751 participants). In addition, exposure to the video plus infographics (adjusted OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.59-2.16; P < .001) and to the infographics alone (adjusted OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.19-1.36; P < .001) were positively associated with washing hands long enough compared with the unexposed group. Exposure to the video alone was not associated with improved handwashing. Compared with the unexposed group, exposure to the infographics alone and video plus infographics were associated with improvements in physical distancing when the participant had COVID-19 syptoms (infographics alone, adjusted OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17; P = .006; video plus infographics, adjusted OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.91; P = .001) and face touching (infographics alone, adjusted OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.22-1.38; P < .001; infographics and video, adjusted OR, 1.49, 95% CI, 1.30-1.71; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that a targeted behavioral change campaign, promoted by a news platform and social media, was associated with self-reported improvement in personal hygiene with the aim to prevent person-to-person transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. This method of evidence-based campaigning may be an effective way to improve critical public health issues, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Yousuf, Hamza; Corbin, Jonathan; Sweep, Govert; Hofstra, Martijn; Scherder, Erik; van Gorp, Eric; Zwetsloot, Peter Paul; Zhao, Jiayu; van Rossum, Bert; Jiang, Ting; Lindemans, Jan-Willem; Narula, Jagat; Hofstra, Leonard",JAMA network open,678,1

Our aim was to evaluate whether multiple-slab acquisition with view angle tilting gradient based on a sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts by using different flip angle evolution (MSVAT-SPACE)-STIR and slice-encoding for metal artifact correction (SEMAC)-STIR are beneficial regarding artifact suppression compared with the SPACE-STIR and TSE-STIR in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS At 3T, 3D artifacts of 2 dental implants, supporting different single crowns, were evaluated. Image quality was evaluated quantitatively (normalized signal-to-noise ratio) and qualitatively (2 reads by 2 blinded radiologists). Feasibility was tested in vivo in 5 volunteers and 5 patients, respectively. RESULTS Maximum achievable resolution and the normalized signal-to-noise ratio of MSVAT-SPACE-STIR were higher compared with SEMAC-STIR. Performance in terms of artifact correction was dependent on the material composition. For highly paramagnetic materials, SEMAC-STIR was superior to MSVAT-SPACE-STIR (27.8% smaller artifact volume) and TSE-STIR (93.2% less slice distortion). However, MSVAT-SPACE-STIR reduced the artifact size compared with SPACE-STIR by 71.5%. For low-paramagnetic materials, MSVAT-SPACE-STIR performed as well as SEMAC-STIR. Furthermore, MSVAT-SPACE-STIR decreased artifact volume by 69.5% compared with SPACE-STIR. The image quality of all sequences did not differ systematically. In vivo results were comparable with in vitro results. CONCLUSIONS Regarding susceptibility artifacts and acquisition time, MSVAT-SPACE-STIR might be advantageous over SPACE-STIR for high-resolution and isotropic head and neck imaging. Only for materials with high-susceptibility differences to soft tissue, the use of SEMAC-STIR might be beneficial. Within limited acquisition times, SEMAC-STIR cannot exploit its full advantage over TSE-STIR regarding artifact suppression.","Hilgenfeld, T; Prager, M; Schwindling, F S; Nittka, M; Rammelsberg, P; Bendszus, M; Heiland, S; Juerchott, A",AJNR.

The degradation led to a breakdown of the panels and increased the potential for nanorelease. Thermal analysis revealed that the thickness of the test panels and reinforcement with MWCNTs had a significant influence on the stability of PP-MWCNT composites. Differential scanning calorimetry indicated that the MWCNTs acted as nucleation points, increasing the crystallization temperatures of PP-MWCNT, which reduced the extent of aging. Weathering decreased both the melting and crystallization temperatures of PP by as much as 20 o C. The reduction in the temperatures was inversely proportional to the thickness of the panels. The activation energy (E a ) obtained using isoconversional kinetics of the TGA analysis showed that the effective thermo-oxidative degradations of PP changed during aging. The E a for the initial stages of thermal degradation decreased from ~330 kJ/mol to ~100 kJ/mol for aged PP. During the late degradation stages, the E a values increased to ~300 kJ/mol. These results suggest that early degradation were altered because of the changes in the molecular structure of the aged P and a shift in the degradation rate-limiting steps.","Han, Changseok; Sahle-Demessie, Endalkachew; Zhao, Amy Q; Richardson, Teri; Wang, Jun",Carbon,678,1

Complementary and alternative therapies (CATs) are used for the treatment of dysmenorrhea. This study investigated the practices and perceptions of female undergraduate students with dysmenorrhea towards CATs. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study conducted among undergraduate pharmacy students in a public university in Malaysia using a validated and pre-tested self-administered questionnaire. The study was conducted in November and December 2019. The data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical tests. RESULTS Of the 318 female undergraduate students invited, 219 completed the questionnaire (response rate: 68.9%) with 52% aged between 21 and 23 years. The prevalence of dysmenorrhea was 72.1%, and the prevalence of ever-use and current use of CATs was 70.3 and 54.4%, respectively. Bed rest (71.5%), hot compress/heating pad (47.5%) and massage (43.0%) were the most common CATs used by the respondents. The most common reasons for using CAT were to reduce the need for analgesics (61.4%), efficacy (37.3%) and recommendation by others (32.9%). About 23 and 9% of the respondents believed that CATs were equally ""effective"" and ""more effective"" than analgesics, respectively. Reducing the need for analgesics (AOR: 4.066, 95% CI: 2.136-7.739) and those who agreed that CATs are effective (AOR: 2.701, 95% CI: 1.337-5.457) were independently associated with the current use CATs for the treatment of menstrual pain. CONCLUSION The prevalence of ever-use and current use of CATs is high among female undergraduate pharmacy students. Bed rest and heat applications are the most common CATs used. Reducing the need for analgesics and efficacy are the factors associated with the current use of CATs. Students should be educated about the safe and effective use of CATs to reduce adverse effects and improve their quality of life.","Abubakar, Usman; Zulkarnain, Amni Izzati; Samri, Fatihah; Hisham, Sabrina Ros; Alias, Anis; Ishak, Muhammad; Sugiman, Hajarah; Ghozali, Taufik",BMC complementary medicine and therapies,678,1

Courses employing multiple educational methods have been shown to be effective in easing learners into new clinical roles during transition periods but, to date, there is limited evidence for courses to support trainees returning to practice (RTP). METHODS A 2-day course, named Springboard, was developed, specifically to address the needs of trainee physicians RTP. It employed a blended, multi-modal approach to learning, including lectures, workshops, case-based sessions, interactive panel discussions, small group teaching, peer-led practical advice sessions and simulation training. Springboard was delivered eight times between 2014 and 2019 with a total of 540 doctors attending. We analysed participant pre-and post-course questionnaire feedback. RESULTS Reasons for doctors taking time out of training included parental leave, research, fellowships in education and leadership, health-related absence and career breaks. Time out of training ranged between 3 months and 6 years. A significant pre/post-course increase in candidates' self-reported leadership skills and confidence in being prepared to return to practice was demonstrated alongside an appreciation of a multi-modal, 'boot camp' course delivered by expert faculty and a networking experience. DISCUSSION Dedicated training courses tailored to the needs of physicians RTP provide an opportunity for improving confidence relating to many areas of clinical and non-clinical practice as well as providing an environment for networking and sharing experiences. Further work would be valuable to establish the potential of providing this on a larger scale.","Mullender, Claire; Gowland, Emily; Ford, Charlotte; Moore, Anna; Fisk, Marie; Bryant, Catherine; Le Ball, Karen; Deaner, Andrew; Birns, Jonathan",The clinical teacher,678,12

OBJECTIVE The purpose of the current review was to systematically compile mediation, longitudinal and experimental evidence in support of this conceptual model. METHODS This systematic review (registered with PROSPERO on 28 April 2020) was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Separate searches were undertaken for each pathway of interest (final search 8 November 2019) using CINAHL Complete, ERIC, Medline (OVID), PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus and SportDiscus. Potential articles were initially identified through abstract and title checking (N = 585) then screened further and combined into one review (n = 152), with 43 articles identified for extraction. Studies needed to be original and peer reviewed, include typically developing children and adolescents first assessed between 2 and 18 years and objective assessment of gross MC and at least one other variable (i.e., PA, weight status, perceived MC, health-related fitness). PA included sport participation, but sport-specific samples were excluded. Longitudinal or experimental designs and cross-sectional mediated models were sought. Strength of evidence was calculated for each pathway in both directions for each domain (i.e., skill composite, object control and locomotor/coordination/stability) by dividing the proportion of studies indicating a significantly positive pathway in the hypothesised direction by the total associations examined for that pathway. Classifications were no association (0-33%), indeterminate/inconsistent (34-59%), or a positive '+' or negative ' - ' association (≥ 60%). The latter category was classified as strong evidence (i.e., ++or --) when four or more studies found an association. If the total number of studies in a domain of interest was three or fewer, this was considered insufficient evidence to make a determination. RESULTS There was strong evidence in both directions for a negative association between MC and weight status. There was strong positive evidence for a pathway from MC to fitness and indeterminate evidence for the reverse. There was indeterminate evidence for a pathway from MC to PA and no evidence for the reverse pathway. There was insufficient evidence for the MC to perceived MC pathway. There was strong positive evidence for the fitness-mediated MC/PA pathway in both directions. There was indeterminate evidence for the perceived MC-mediated pathway from PA to MC and no evidence for the reverse. CONCLUSION Bidirectional longitudinal associations of MC with weight status are consistent with the model authored by Stodden et al. (Quest 2008;60(2):290-306, 2008). However, to test the whole model, the field needs robust longitudinal studies across childhood and adolescence that include all variables in the model, have multiple time points and account for potential confounding factors. Furthermore, experimental studies that examine change in MC relative to change in the other constructs are needed.

It is associated with several important medical conditions, including depression, psoriatic arthritis, and cardiometabolic syndrome. Its most common form, chronic plaque or psoriasis vulgaris, is a consequence of genetic susceptibility, particularly in the presence of the HLA-C*06:02 risk allele, and of environmental triggers such as streptococcal infection, stress, smoking, obesity, and alcohol consumption. There are several phenotypes and research has separated pustular from chronic plaque forms. Immunological and genetic studies have identified IL-17 and IL-23 as key drivers of psoriasis pathogenesis. Immune targeting of these cytokines and of TNFα by biological therapies has revolutionised the care of severe chronic plaque disease. Psoriasis cannot currently be cured, but management should aim to minimise physical and psychological harm by treating patients early in the disease process, identifying and preventing associated multimorbidity, instilling lifestyle modifications, and employing a personalised approach to treatment.","Griffiths, Christopher E M; Armstrong, April W; Gudjonsson, Johann E; Barker, Jonathan N W N",Lancet,678,1

In this study, we aimed to investigate variations in distributional characteristics and the clinical implications of variant type in PCDH19-related epilepsy. We comprehensively collected PCDH19 missense and truncating variants from the literature and by sequencing six exons and intron-exon boundaries of PCDH19 in our cohort. We investigated the distribution of each type of variant using the cumulative distribution function and tested for associations between variant types and phenotypes. The distribution of missense variants in patients was clearly different from that of healthy individuals and was uniform throughout the extracellular cadherin (EC) domain, which consisted of six highly conserved domains. Truncating variants showed two types of distributions: (1) located from EC domain 1 to EC domain 4, and (2) located from EC domain 5 to the cytoplasmic domain. Furthermore, we also found that later onset seizures and milder intellectual disability occurred in patients with truncating variants located from EC domain 5 to the cytoplasmic domain compared with those of patients with other variants. Our findings provide the first evidence of two types of truncating variants in the PCDH19 gene with regard to distribution and the resulting clinical phenotype.","Shibata, Mami; Ishii, Atsushi; Goto, Ayako; Hirose, Shinichi",Journal of human genetics,678,29

Rapid, accurate identification of poorly performing hospitals is critical for avoiding potentially preventable mortality and represents an opportunity to enhance QI efforts. METHODS Hospital-level analysis using Veterans Affairs (VA) Surgical Quality Improvement Program data (2011-2016) to compare identification of hospitals with excess, risk-adjusted 30-day mortality using observed-to-expected (O-E) ratios (ie, current gold standard) and cumulative sum (CUSUM) with V-mask. Various V-mask slopes and radii were evaluated-slope of 2.5 and radius of 1.0 was used as the base case. RESULTS Hospitals identified by CUSUM and quarterly O-E were identified midway into a quarter [median 47 days; interquartile range (IQR): 24-61 days before quarter end] translating to a median of 129 (IQR: 60-187) surgical cases and 368 (IQR: 145-681) postoperative inpatient days occurring after a CUSUM signal, but before the quarter end. At hospitals identified by CUSUM but not O-E, a median of 2 deaths within a median of 5 days triggered a signal. In some cases, these clusters extended beyond CUSUM identification date with as many as 8 deaths undetected using O-E. Sensitivity and negative predictive values for CUSUM relative to O-E were 71.9% (95% confidence interval: 66.2%-77.1%) and 95.5% (94.4%-96.4%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS CUSUM evaluation identifies hospitals with clusters of mortality in excess of expected more rapidly than periodic analysis. CUSUM represents an analytic tool national QI programs could utilize to provide participating hospitals with data that could facilitate more proactive implementation of local interventions to help reduce potentially avoidable perioperative mortality.","Massarweh, Nader N; Chen, Vivi W; Rosen, Tracey; Dong, Yongquan; Richardson, Peter A; Axelrod, David A; Harris, Alex H S; Wilson, Mark A; Petersen, Laura A",Medical care,678,1

Might it forbid one from social distancing, at least away from intimates? Or would it entail that social distancing is wrong to some degree, although morally permissible on balance? Or could it mean that social distancing is not wrong to any degree and could, under certain circumstances, be the right way to commune? In this article, I defend the latter view. I argue that, given an independently attractive understanding of how to value communal relationship, distancing oneself from others when necessary to protect them from serious incapacitation or harm can come at no cost to right action.

During sternotomy, trabecular bone is exposed, often resulting in bleeding, which can be treated with mechanical hemostatic agents; however, their influence on the healing process is relatively unexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of two hemostatic agents: bone wax (BW) and a water-soluble polymer wax, Ostene (WSW), on the mechanical and histologic characteristics of healing sternal bone. METHODS Twenty-four pigs underwent sternotomy and were randomized into three groups: WSW, BW, or no hemostatic treatment (control). Bone samples were obtained 6 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS Fracture strength (Fmax) and maximum stiffness (dF/dx) was lower in the BW group than in controls (Fmax: 175.2 vs. 255.8 N, dF/dx: 165.2 vs. 375.4 N/mm,) (p < 0.05). The stiffness did not differ statistically between the WSW and BW groups (298.4 vs 165.2 N/mm) nor did the fracture strength (211.4 vs 175.2 N). The fraction of granulomatous tissue was higher in the BW group compared with both the WSW group (79.1 vs. 16.52%) (p < 0.001) and controls (79.1 vs. 11.2%) (p < 0.001). There was more calcified tissue in controls than in the BW group (23.4 vs. 10.8%) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In a porcine model, BW significantly inhibited sternal healing and was associated with chronic inflammation and reduced mechanical integrity. The WSW did not, to the same degree as BW, inhibit bone healing and thus presents an alternative treatment option for sternal bleeding.","Vestergaard, Rikke F; Brüel, Annemarie; Thomsen, Jesper S; Hauge, Ellen M; Søballe, Kjeld; Hasenkam, J Michael",The Annals of thoracic surgery,678,31

To overcome these obstacles, we developed a self-sustaining multipurpose internal retractor by attaching a Lone Star retractor hook to a laparoscopic bulldog clamp. Herein, we report our SIS experience using our novel retractor. Between October 2008 and April 2011, 104 patients underwent SIS using the internal retractor: 67 bandings (43% simultaneous hiatal hernia repair), 8 sleeve gastrectomies, 27 cholecystectomies, and 2 Nissen fundoplication. Mean age was 40 (range, 21 to 85) and mean body mass index was 40 kg/m (range, 20 to 64 kg/m). No intraoperative complications were observed from the use of the retractor but 2 cases required additional retraction due to liver size. This retractor has been successfully used for different SIS procedures showing to be safe, adaptable, and easy to use, lessening some challenges of SIS.","Galvani, Carlos A; Garza, Ulises; Echeverria, Angela; Kaul, Amit; Samamé, Julia","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",678,1

A systematic exploration of viruses that infect humans is the key to effectively counter the potential public health threat caused by new and emerging infectious diseases. The human gut is a known reservoir of a wide variety of microorganisms, including viruses. In this study, Dutch clinical diarrhea samples for which no etiological agent could be identified by available cell culture, serological, or nucleic acid-based tests were gathered. Large-scale molecular RNA virus screening based on host nucleic acid depletion, sequence-independent amplification, and sequencing of partially purified viral RNA from a limited number of clinical diarrhea samples revealed four eukaryotic virus species. Among the detected viruses were a rhinovirus and a new picobirnavirus variant. In total, approximately 20% of clinical diarrhea samples contained human picobirnavirus sequences. The Dutch picobirnaviruses belonged to different phylogenetic clades and did not group with other picobirnaviruses according to year of isolation or host species. Interestingly, the average age of patients infected with picobirnavirus was significantly higher than that of uninfected patients. Our data show that sequence-independent amplification of partially purified viral RNA is an efficient procedure for identification of known and highly divergent new RNA viruses in clinical diarrhea samples.","van Leeuwen, Marije; Williams, Marisol M W; Koraka, Penelope; Simon, James H; Smits, Saskia L; Osterhaus, Albert D M E",Journal of clinical microbiology,678,30

On the basis of the approved human dosing, toxicity/tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data, seven of these in vitro hits from different pharmacological classes (chloroquine (CQ), amiodarone, prochlorperazine, benztropine, azithromycin, chlortetracycline, and clomiphene) were evaluated for their in vivo efficacy at a single dose and were administered via either intraperitoneal (ip) or oral route. Initially, azithromycin (100 mg/kg, twice daily, ip), CQ (90 mg/kg, twice daily, ip), and amiodarone (60 mg/kg, twice daily, ip) demonstrated significant increases in survival in the mouse model. After repeat evaluation, only CQ was found to reproducibly give significant efficacy in the mouse model with this dosing regimen. Azithromycin and CQ were also tested in a guinea pig model of EBOV infection over a range of doses, but none of the doses increased survival, and drug-related toxicity was observed at lower doses than in the mouse.

The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) were used.Results: Females' anxiety risk was 3.01 times compared to males (95% CI 1.39-6.52). Compared with people below 40 years old, the anxiety risk of people above 40 years old was 0.40 times (95% CI 0.16-0.99). SDS results indicated that the difference between education level and occupation was statistically significant (p = 0.024, 0.005).

Areas covered: The late stage is usually defined as the period from unstable advanced to the palliative stage, characterized by a combination of an emerging treatment-resistant axial motor symptoms (freezing of gait, postural instability, falls and dysphagia), as well as both non-dopaminergic and dopaminergic NMS: cognitive decline, neuropsychiatric symptoms, aspects of dysautonomia, pain and sleep disturbances (insomnia and excessive day-time sleepiness). Here, the authors summarize the current knowledge on NMS dominating the late stage of PD and propose a pragmatic and clinically focused approach for their recognition and treatment. Expert opinion: The NMS progression pattern is complex and remains under-researched. While dopamine-dependent NMS may improve with dopamine replacement therapy, non-dopamine dependent NMS worsen progressively and culminate at the late stages of PD. Furthermore, some PD specific features could interact negatively with other comorbidities, multiple medication use and frailty - the evaluation of these aspects is important in the creation of personalized management plans in the late stages of PD.","Rukavina, Katarina; Batzu, Lucia; Boogers, Alexandra; Abundes-Corona, Arturo; Bruno, Veronica; Chaudhuri, K Ray",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,678,6

This, unfortunately results in frequent catheter-related complications such as infection, malfunction, vessel stenosis, and obstruction, leading to loss of permanent central venous access with superior vena cava obstruction. It is important to preserve central vein patency by reducing the number of internal jugular catheter insertions for incident HD patients with a functional vascular access. We sought to achieve this by introducing in-patient intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD) as bridging therapy while awaiting establishment of long-term vascular access for HD patients. METHODS Incident HD patients without permanent vascular access encountered from January to December 2014 were included in this study. Patients were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 were encountered within 6 months prior to introduction of in-patient IPD bridging therapy in substitution of noncuffed catheter (NCC) insertion while awaiting maturation of permanent vascular access. Group 2 were encountered within 6 months after the introduction of this policy. The number of NCC and peritoneal dialysiscatheter insertion, along with catheter-related infections were evaluated during this period. RESULTS Approximately 450 patients were distributed in each group. We achieved 45% reduction in internal jugular catheter insertion from 322 to 180 catheters after policy change. This led to a significant drop in catheter-related blood stream infection (53%, P <0.001). On the other hand, 30% more peritoneal dialysiscatheter were inserted to accommodate our IPD bridging therapy. CONCLUSIONS The introduction of IPD as bridging therapy while awaiting maturation of permanent vascular access significantly reduced the utilization of NCC in incident HD patients and catherter-related blodstream infection. With this, it is our hope that it will contribute to the preservation of central vein patency.","Shanmuganathan, Malini; Goh, Bak Leong; Lim, Christopher T S",The American journal of the medical sciences,678,1

Teleradiology is a form of telehealth service that involves the transmission of radiological images, such as x-rays, CTs and MRIs, from one location to another to share patient information with other physicians. The purpose of this study was to assess teleradiology consultations for orthopaedic patients at a paediatric tertiary care centre. A retrospective review was conducted of patients who received teleradiology consultations with a single orthopaedic surgeon from 2015 to 2018 through the paediatric orthopaedic hip clinic at our institution. Teleradiology consultations involved follow-up radiographic imaging at a local community facility for patients who initially received healthcare services at our institution, followed by a telephone consultation to review imaging results and communicate next steps in care. Data collected included patient demographics, imaging type, facility location and distance from our institution. Eighty patients (F = 66, M = 14) who received teleradiology services were reviewed. Mean age was 3.5 years [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.5-4.4] at time of imaging. The average distance from community facilities to our institution was 1167 km (95% confidence interval: 920-1414), a measure of the total distance saved in travel for each patient in a single direction. The travel distance saved was substantial. Paediatric orthopaedic teleradiology services provide families specialized consultations and care continuity without costly travel. With increased implementation of teleradiology services, more patients and families can remain in their home communities while receiving the same quality of care.","Habib, Eva; Krishnaswamy, Wendy; Wu, Judy K; Schaeffer, Emily K; Mulpuri, Kishore",Journal of pediatric orthopedics.

Based on our literature review, there has been a relative increase in the number of such cases being treated by hysterotomy and/or local uterine lesion resection and repair. In the present study, a retrospective analysis was conducted to compare the clinical outcomes when different management strategies were used to terminate pregnancy in the patients with placenta previa and PAS. METHODS A total of 51 patients who underwent pregnancy termination in the second trimester in Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital between June 2013 and December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed in this study. All patients having previous caesarean delivery (CD) were diagnosed with placenta previa status and PAS. RESULTS ① Among the 51 patients, 16 cases received mifepristone and misoprostol medical termination, 15 cases received mifepristone and Rivanol medical termination, but 1 of them was transferred to hysterotomy due to failed labor induction, another 20 cases were performed planned hysterotomy. There was no placenta percreta cases and uterine artery embolization (UAE) was all performed before surgery.② There were 31 cases who underwent medical termination and 30 cases were vaginal delivery. Dilation and evacuation (D&E) were used in 20 cases of medical abortion failure and in all 30 cases of difficult manual removal of placental tissue. ③ A statistically significant difference was found among the three different strategies in terms of gestational weeks, the type of placenta previa status, main operative success rate and β-HCG regression time (P < 0.05). ④ There were 4(7.8%) cases who were taken up for hysterectomy because of life-threatening bleeding or severe bacteremia during or after delivery and hysterotomy. The uterus was preserved with the implanted placenta partly or completely left in situ in 47(92.2%) cases. Combined medical and/or surgical management were used for the residual placenta and the time of menstrual recovery was 52(range: 33 to 86) days after pregnancy termination. CONCLUSIONS Terminating a pregnancy by vaginal delivery through medical induction of labor may be feasible if clinicians have an overall understanding of gestational age, the type of placenta previa status, the type of placenta accreta, and patients concerns about preserving fertility. A collaborative team effort in tertiary medical centers with a very experience MDT and combined application of multiple methods is required to optimize patient outcomes.","Hu, Qiaofei; Li, Changdong; Luo, Lanrong; Li, Jian; Zhang, Xiaofeng; Chen, Suwen; Yang, Xiaokui",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,678,19

METHODS Using latent profile analysis, this study examined patterns of self-reported daily time use (0-12h hours) for nine types of behaviour (work, errands, housework, childcare, care of persons in need, education, repairs and gardening, physical activity, and hobbies/leisure-time activities) in the 2018 wave of the German Socio-Economic Panel (N = 30,152; 51.9% female; M = 46.87 years). Sociodemographic variables, affective wellbeing, general and domain-specific life satisfaction, and self-rated health were inspected as predictors via multinomial logistic regression models. RESULTS Six latent profiles emerged: full-time work (47.2%), leisure (33.8%), childcare (8.9%), education (7.0%), part-time work & care (2.6%), and care (0.5%). Overall, the care and part-time work & care profiles showed the lowest wellbeing scores, lower subjective health, and life satisfaction. Women were more likely to be members of the care and childcare profiles. Men were more likely to belong to the full-time work profile, and they reported significantly higher wellbeing than women. CONCLUSIONS The analysis revealed distinct patterns of time use and a burden on women, given their investment in care and childcare. Part-time work, and care seemed particularly demanding, and thus, are important areas for prevention, for instance, regarding mental health problems. However, time use was assessed via self-reports, therefore future studies could implement objective measures like digital trackers to validate findings.","Tomczyk, Samuel; Altweck, Laura; Schmidt, Silke",BMC public health,678,16

This study also presents the clinical use of a superior labial musculomucosal flap in a dog. MATERIALS AND METHODS The common carotid arteries of six canine cadavers were injected with barium sulphate. The skin of the face and labial mucosa was removed and radiographed to study the vascular supply of the superior and inferior labia. RESULTS The angiograms in all dogs demonstrated that the superior and inferior labial arteries were located within the musculomucosal layer of the labia. At the junction of the rostral and caudal half of the upper lip, extensive choke anastomoses joined the angiosome of the infra-orbital artery. The inferior labial artery perfused the caudal half of the lower labium and had extensive choke anastomoses with the middle and rostral mental arteries. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The musculomucosal flaps of the superior and inferior labia contain a rich arterial blood supply, which suggests that these flaps may survive in live dogs. The superior labial musculomucosal flap was successfully used to reconstruct a large cleft palate in a single clinical case.","Doyle, Cody P; Degner, Daniel A",Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T,678,1

Methods: The tracking of all the close contacts of the first COVID-19 case and epidemiological investigation were conducted on January 29, 2020 after a cluster epidemic of COVID-19 related with a Buddhism rally on January 19 (the 1.19 rally) in Ningbo occurred. The swabs of nose/throat of the cases and close contacts were collected and tested for nucleic acids by real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR. Results: From January 26 to February 20, 2020, a total of 67 COVID-19 cases and 15 asymptomatic infection cases related with the 1.19 rally were reported in Ningbo. The initial case was the infection source who infected 29 second generation cases and 4 asymptomatic infection cases, in whom 23 second generation cases and 3 asymptomatic infection cases once took bus with the initial case, the attack rate was 33.82% (23/68) and the infection rate was 38.24% (26/68). The risks of suffering from COVID-19 and being infected were 28.91 times and 26.01 times higher in rally participants taking bus with initial case compared with those taking no bus with initial case. In this epidemic, 37 third+ generation cases and 11 related asymptomatic infection cases occurred, the attack rate was 2.88% (37/1 283) and the infection rate was 4.76% (48/1 008). The main transmission routes included vehicle sharing and family transmission. Conclusion: It was a cluster epidemic of COVID-19 caused by a super spreader in a massive rally.

The consistent emergence and re-emergence of ebolaviruses into a world that previously lacked an approved pharmaceutical intervention parallels an experience repeatedly played-out for most other emerging pathogenic zoonotic viruses. Investment to preemptively develop effective and low-cost prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against viruses that have high potential for emergence and societal impact should be a priority. Areas covered. Candidate drugs can be characterized into those that interfere with cellular processes required for ebola virus (EBOV) replication (host-directed), and those that directly target virally encoded functions (direct-acting). We discuss strategies to identify pharmaceutical interventions for EBOV infections. PubMed/Web of Science databases were searched to establish a detailed catalogue of these interventions. Expert opinion. Many drug candidates show promising in vitro inhibitory activity, but experience with EBOV shows the general lack of translation to in vivo efficacy for host-directed repurposed drugs. Better translation is seen for direct-acting antivirals, in particular monoclonal antibodies. The FDA-approved monoclonal antibody treatment, Inmazeb™ is a success story that could be improved in terms of impact on EBOV-associated disease and mortality, possibly by combination with other direct-acting agents targeting distinct aspects of the viral replication cycle. Costs need to be addressed given EBOV emergence primarily in under-resourced countries.","Hansen, Frederick; Feldmann, Heinz; Jarvis, Michael A",Expert opinion on investigational drugs,678,11
99118,99118,99118,Evaluation of absorbable and permanent mesh fixation devices: adhesion formation and mechanical strength.,9.263565,3.2365618,2011,"We derive a model of band broadening in multiple-open-tubular columns enabling transverse diffusion (MOTTD). In MOTTD columns, the flow channels are straight, parallel, cylindrical tubes arranged in a hexagonal compact array. A mesoporous material or stationary phase (130 Å bridged-ethyl hybrid (BEH) silica support) is filling the volume between the flow channels. The model is based on Giddings' random-walk theory of non-equilibrium chromatography. It is calibrated for the unknown configuration factor, qs, related to the specific geometry of the stationary phase in MOTTD columns. qs values are found based on the best fit of the model to simulated dispersion data obtained by the lattice-Boltzmann method for modelling fluid flow and a random-walk particle-tracking technique to address advective-diffusive transport of the analytes. For the model calibration, simulations are performed for different ratios, ρ, of the average inner diameter of the flow channels to their closest center-to-center distance under retained and non-retained conditions. The model is successfully validated (average relative errors below 10%) under both retained and non-retained conditions. For the same column format (4.6 mm i.d. × 150 mm), external porosity, zone retention factor, and relative standard deviation of the distribution of the inner diameters of the flow channels, the derived model reveals the intrinsic advantage of MOTTD columns (center-to-center distance between flow channels of 5 µm and ρ = 0.62) over a conventional column packed with 5 µm 130 Å BEH silica particles and the same multiple porous-layer open-tubular column (MPLOT) disabling transverse dispersion. MOTTD columns are weakly affected by the polydispersity of the inner diameter of the flow channels. Provided MOTTD columns could be prepared at a small feature size of 5 µm or less, they are expected to deliver a significant improvement in column technology relative to current particulate and silica monolithic columns.","Gritti, Fabrice; Hlushkou, Dzmitry; Tallarek, Ulrich",Journal of chromatography.

DAPT may significantly increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications in patients who require subsequent surgical interventions. In this study, the authors sought to investigate whether DAPT is a risk factor for hemorrhagic complications associated with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Moreover, the authors sought to compare VP shunt complication rates with respect to the shunt's location from the initial external ventricular drain (EVD) site. METHODS Patients with aSAH who presented to the authors' institution from July 2009 through November 2016 and required VP shunt placement for persistent hydrocephalus were included. The rates of hemorrhagic complications associated with VP shunt placement were compared between patients who were on a regimen of DAPT (aspirin and clopidogrel) for use of a stent or flow diverter, and patients who underwent microsurgical clipping or coiling only and were not on DAPT using a backward stepwise multivariate analysis. Rates of radiographic hemorrhage and infection-related VP shunt revision were compared between patients who underwent VP shunt placement along the same track and those who underwent VP shunt placement at a different site (contralateral or posterior) from the initial EVD. RESULTS A total of 443 patients were admitted for the management of aSAH. Eighty of these patients eventually required VP shunt placement. Thirty-two patients (40%) had been treated with stent-assisted coiling or flow diverters and required DAPT, whereas 48 patients (60%) had been treated with coiling without stents or surgical clipping and were not on DAPT at the time of VP shunt placement. A total of 8 cases (10%) of new hemorrhage were observed along the intracranial proximal catheter of the VP shunt. Seven of these hemorrhages were observed in patients on DAPT, and 1 occurred in a patient not on DAPT. After multivariate analysis, only DAPT was significantly associated with hemorrhage (OR 31.23, 95% CI 2.98-327.32; p = 0.0001). One patient (3%) on DAPT who experienced hemorrhage required shunt revision for hemorrhage-associated proximal catheter blockage. The remaining 7 hemorrhages were clinically insignificant. The difference in rates of hemorrhage between shunt placement along the same track and placement at a different site of 0.07 was not significant (6/47 vs 2/32, p = 0.46). The difference in infection-related VP shunt revision rate was not significantly different (1/47 vs 3/32, p = 0.2978). CONCLUSIONS This clinical series confirms that, in patients with ruptured aneurysms who are candidates for stent-assisted coiling or flow diversion, the risk of clinically significant VP shunt-associated hemorrhage with DAPT is low. In an era of evolving endovascular therapeutics, stenting or flow diversion is a viable option in select aSAH patients.","Hudson, Joseph S; Nagahama, Yasunori; Nakagawa, Daichi; Starke, Robert M; Dlouhy, Brian J; Torner, James C; Jabbour, Pascal; Allan, Lauren; Derdeyn, Colin P; Greenlee, Jeremy D W; Hasan, David",Journal of neurosurgery,678,27

It is necessary to understand the dynamics of the virus which was classified among the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) related coronaviruses and named as SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), to manage testing in the right strategy and for interpretation of the results. However, much remains unclear about the virus and the immune response. SARS-CoV-2, which is an enveloped, RNA virus has been shown to attach to the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 with spike (S) protein and membrane fusion is provided by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) of the host cell. The most commonly used and reliable test for diagnosis of COVID-19 is reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed by using nasopharyngeal swabs or other respiratory tract specimens. Viral RNA is usually detected two three days before the onset of symptoms and in the first week from upper respiratory tract samples. If possible, the lower respiratory tract specimens are preferable in the second week, especially if former PCR is negative and pneumonia has developed. The clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests has been reported around 55-75%. Negative RT-PCR test result does not exclude COVID-19 or SARSCoV-2 infection. It should also be noted that viral RNA positivity is not an evidence of active or infectious virus. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be also detected indirectly by testing the host specific immune response to the virus. There is an increasing interest in the use of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests both for the diagnosis and public health surveillance. However, the antibody tests should not be used as the sole test for diagnosis and case management. Antibody tests are valuable tools in seroepidemiological studies. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies have been shown to be detectable as early as 5th-14th days after the onset of symptoms and most of them become positive on the 21st day. False positivity has been reported more frequently with IgM and IgA tests due to low specificity. It was shown that clinical sensitivity of the diagnostic approach increases when RNA and total antibody tests were integrated as co-tests, especially after the second week of the disease. Specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values are needed to be evaluated with large and standard studies targeting populations with different prevalences. It is also necessary to create evidence with larger seroconversion studies. In this review article, the information and data obtained until today about SARS-CoV-2 and its microbiological diagnosis have been discussed.","Erensoy, Selda",Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,678,28

Our aim was to study the influence of baseline ECG parameters, including interatrial block (IAB), in the prognosis of patients treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Methods and Results The BIT (Baseline Interatrial Block and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) registry included 2527 patients with aortic stenosis treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation. A centralized analysis of baseline ECGs was performed. Patients were divided into 4 groups: normal P wave duration (<120 ms); partial IAB (P wave duration ≥120 ms, positive in the inferior leads); advanced IAB (P wave duration ≥120 ms, biphasic [+/-] morphology in the inferior leads); and nonsinus rhythm (atrial fibrillation/flutter and paced rhythm). The mean age of patients was 82.6±9.8 years and 1397 (55.3%) were women. A total of 960 patients (38.0%) had a normal P wave, 582 (23.0%) had partial IAB, 300 (11.9%) had advanced IAB, and 685 (27.1%) presented with nonsinus rhythm. Mean follow-up duration was 465±171 days. Advanced IAB was the only independent predictor of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.10-1.98 [P=0.010]) and of the composite end point (death/stroke/new atrial fibrillation) (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.17-1.94 [P=0.001]). Conclusions Baseline ECG characteristics influence the prognosis of patients with aortic stenosis treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Advanced IAB is present in about an eighth of patients and is associated with all-cause death and the composite end point of death, stroke, and new atrial fibrillation during follow-up.","Vicent, Lourdes; Fernández-Cordón, Clara; Nombela-Franco, Luis; Escobar-Robledo, Luis Alberto; Ayesta, Ana; Ariza Solé, Albert; Gómez-Doblas, Juan José; Bernal, Eva; Tirado-Conte, Gabriela; Cobiella, Javier; González-Saldivar, Hugo; López-Otero, Diego; Díez-Villanueva, Pablo; Sarnago, Fernando; Armario, Xavier; Bayés-de-Luna, Antonio; Martínez-Sellés, Manuel",Journal of the American Heart Association,678,8

The aim of this study was to compare the perioperative outcomes between robotic and laparoscopic liver surgeries at a single center. METHODS From July 2007 to October 2011, a total of 206 patients underwent laparoscopic or robotic liver surgery at the Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. We compared the surgical outcomes between robotic liver surgery and laparoscopic liver surgery during the same period. Only patients who underwent left hemihepatectomy or left lateral sectionectomy were included in this study. RESULTS The robotic group consisted of 13 patients who underwent robotic liver resection including 10 left lateral sectionectomies and three left hemihepatectomies. The laparoscopic group consisted of 17 patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resection during the same period including six left lateral sectionectomies and 11 left hemihepatectomies. The groups were similar with regard to age, gender, tumor type, and tumor size. There were no significant differences in perioperative outcome such as operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative liver function tests, complication rate, and hospital stay between robotic liver resection and laparoscopic liver resection. However, the medical cost was higher in the robotic group. CONCLUSIONS Robotic liver resection is a safe and feasible option for liver resection in experienced hands. The authors suggest that since the robotic surgical system provides sophisticated advantages, the retrenchment of medical cost for the robotic system in addition to refining its liver transection tool may substantially increase its application in clinical practice in the near future.","Yu, Young-Dong; Kim, Ki-Hun; Jung, Dong-Hwan; Namkoong, Jung-Man; Yoon, Sam-Youl; Jung, Sung-Won; Lee, Sang-Kyung; Lee, Sung-Gyu",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,678,17

This form of crowdfunding is growing in popularity, and its visibility is increasing as campaigns are commonly shared via social networking. A number of ethical issues have been raised about medical crowdfunding, one of which is that it introduces a number of privacy concerns. While campaigners are encouraged to share very personal details to encourage donations, the sharing of such details may result in privacy losses for the beneficiary. Here, we explore the ways in which privacy can be threatened through the practice of medical crowdfunding by exploring campaigns (n=100) for children with defined health needs scraped from the GoFundMe platform. We found specific privacy concerns related to the disclosure of private details about the beneficiary, the inclusion of images and the nature of the relationship between campaigner, funding recipient and beneficiary. For example, it was found that identifying personal and medical details about the beneficiary, including symptoms (n=52) and treatment history (n=43), were often mentioned by campaigners. While the privacy concerns identified are problematic, they are also difficult to remedy given the strong financial incentive to crowdfund. However, crowdfunding platforms can enhance privacy protections by, for example, requiring those campaigning on behalf of child beneficiaries to ensure consent has been obtained from their guardians and providing additional guidelines for the inclusion of personal information in campaigns made on behalf of those not able to give their consent to the campaign.","Snyder, Jeremy; Crooks, Valorie A",Journal of medical ethics,678,1

We performed phylogenetic analysis using a 366 bp fragment of segment A (nt 785 - 1150) and a 508 bp fragment of segment B (nt 328 - 835) of IBDV. A total of 463 segment A and 434 segment B sequences from the GenBank including the sequences of eight recent Bangladeshi isolates were used in the analysis. The analysis revealed eight genogroups of segment A under serotype 1, designated as A1 (classical), A2 (US antigenic variant), A3 (very virulent), A4 (dIBDV), A5 (atypical Mexican), A6 (atypical Italian), A7 (early Australian) and A8 (Australian variant) and a single genogroup under serotype 2, designated as A0. On the other side segment B could be categorized into five genogroups irrespective of serotype, such as B1 (classical-like), B2 (very virulent-like), B3 (early Australasian-like), B4 (Polish & Tanzanian) and B5 (Nigerian). Segment B of serotype 2 strains clustered within genogroup B1. With the bi-segmented genome of IBDV, these differences would allow for a total of 45 possible assortments. Based on the combinations of segment A and segment B genogroups observed in 463 IBDV strains, a total of 15 genotypes could be recognized. Recent Bangladeshi IBDV strains, isolated in 2016, appeared to be segment reassortants having segment A of genogroup A3 (very virulent) and segment B of genogroup B3 (early Australian-like). An extended system of nomenclature of IBDV strains is proposed.","Islam, Mohammad Rafiqul; Nooruzzaman, Mohammed; Rahman, Md Tazinur; Mumu, Tanjin Tamanna; Rahman, Mohammad Mijanur; Chowdhury, Emdadul Haque; Eterradossi, Nicolas; Müller, Hermann",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,678,7

We aimed to determine the proportion of patients with AIDS-related opportunistic fungal infections (OFIs) at an urban antiretroviral treatment (ART) centre in Nigeria. Methods A retrospective analysis of a cohort of ART-naïve, HIV-infected patients, assessed for ART eligibility and ARTexperience at the PEPFAR outpatient clinic at Lagos University Teaching Hospital over a 12-year period (April 2004-February 2016) was conducted. Results During this period, 7,034 patients visited the clinic: 4,797 (68.2%) were female; 6161 patients had a recorded baseline CD4 count, and the median CD4 count was 184 cells/µl (IQR, 84-328). A baseline HIV-1 viral load (VL) was recorded for 5,908 patients; the median VL was 51,194 RNA copies/ml (IQR, 2,316-283,508) and 6,179/7046(88%) had initiated ART. Some 2,456 (34.9%) had a documented opportunistic infections, of whom 1,306 (18.6%) had an opportunistic fungal infection. The total number of OFI episodes was 1,632: oral candidiasis (n=1,473, 90.3%), oesophageal candidiasis (n=118; 8%), superficial mycoses (n=23; 1.6%), Pneumocystis pneumonia (PJP) (n=13; 0.8%), and cryptococcal meningitis(CM) (n=5; 0.4%). 113 (1.6%) were known to have died in the cohort. Conclusion Approximately 1 in 5 HIV-infected patients in this retrospective cohort, most of whom had initiated ART, were clinically diagnosed with an OFI. Improved access to simple accurate diagnostic tests for CM and PJP should be prioritised for this setting.","Oladele, Rita; Ogunsola, Folasade; Akanmu, Alani; Stocking, Katie; Denning, David W; Govender, Nelesh",African health sciences,678,31

Little did we know that soon after Europe and the rest of the world (with Asia already earlier) would be in lock-down due to COVID-19. It has been a strange year. And now, at the start of 2021, the excitement of having a vaccine is tempered by the fact that everywhere mutants of the virus pop up. Although this was likely to occur, as also the influenza virus keeps mutating, it means that at the moment it is unclear as to whether the current situation of lock-downs and social distancing will remain for a longer period than we had anticipated and hoped for at the end of 2020 when it became clear that several vaccines were efficacious. Some studies have shown a role of the gut microbiota composition in disease severity, together with vitamin D, cholesterol and other factors. It was a hype to write a 'review' on gut microbiota and the effect on COVID-19, and also the board of Beneficial Microbes has received several submissions of so-called reviews on the topic. However, all of them were rejected, as they were mere speculations about how the gut microbiota might affect virus infection and disease severity, without any data whatsoever. However, there are some good studies out there that have shown that a proper gut microbiota may indeed influence disease severity, such as recently reviewed by Kim (2021). All in all, this may not be too surprising for the knowledgeable reader, as they would know that the microbiota plays a role in everything that can be wrong with us!","Venema, Koen",Beneficial microbes,678,1

Materials and Methods: In April and May 2020, an online survey comprised of questions regarding past and current VH practices, as well as plans for future use was distributed among eye care providers nationwide. Results: Of the 117 eye care providers who completed the survey, 96.6% were not using VH before the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, 77.4% reported using VH during the pandemic. The majority of visits were for red eye (64.4%, n = 56) and ocular surface complaints (58.6%, n = 51). Examination components tested virtually varied, but most respondents felt these were at least ""somewhat reliable."" Almost half of respondents (45%) felt it was ""very easy"" or ""somewhat easy"" to implement VH and the majority (53.8%, n = 43) were able to get it up and running in under a week. The majority felt the transition to VH was positive (57.5%), however, only 50.4% (n = 53) of those providers planned to use VH regularly once able to see patients safely in clinic again. Conclusions: While the majority of U.S. eye care providers who responded were not using VH before the COVID-19 pandemic, just months into the U.S. outbreak, 77.4% were using VH in their daily practice. In general, providers used these platforms for urgent examinations, adnexal disease, and postoperative care most often. The majority felt the transition was a positive one, however, only half planned to continue regular use of VH once the pandemic ended.","Capitena Young, Cara E; Patnaik, Jennifer L; Seibold, Leonard K; Kahook, Malik Y",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,678,1

We aimed to provide an overview of childhood HSCT survivors' status on these parameters compared with healthy controls and discuss current insights into clinical risk factors. We performed a systematic search in six scientific databases, including studies published before April 2019 and performed a meta-analysis on cardiorespiratory fitness. Muscle strength and physical performance status were presented narratively. We included ten studies embodying 517 childhood HSCT survivors (mean 17.8 years at follow-up). The meta-analysis (n = 4 studies) showed that childhood HSCT survivors have lower cardiorespiratory fitness compared with healthy controls (Standard mean difference (SMD) -1.32 [95% CI -1-58 to -1.07]; I2 2%, p < 0.00001). Collectively, the studies indicated that childhood HSCT survivors have lower muscle strength (n = 4 studies) and physical performance (n = 3 studies) compared with healthy controls. Childhood HSCT survivors have impaired cardiorespiratory fitness years after ended treatment. Muscle strength and physical performance seem to be impaired, although these measures are insufficiently investigated. Associations between HSCT-specific clinical risk factors and cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, and physical performance are required.","Fridh, Martin Kaj; Simonsen, Casper; Schmidt-Andersen, Peter; Nissen, Anne Anker; Christensen, Jesper Frank; Larsen, Anders; Mackey, Abigail L; Larsen, Hanne Bækgaard; Müller, Klaus",Bone marrow transplantation,678,12

Natural products may follow different regulations, from food to therapeutics. Concerning their isolated constituents, extracts are characterized by a complexity that is not easily tackled from both a scientific and a regulatory point of view, but more importantly, from a therapeutic point of view. The evidence-based approach applied to isolated molecules requires appropriate evidence of quality, efficacy, and safety. The same needs must be reached for complex substances by finding appropriate methods to generate this evidence, and in addition, defining an appropriate regulatory field for them. From a scientific point of view, new methods, such as those proposed by systems biology, are available and applicable to complex substances. From a regulatory point of view, Directive 2001/83/EC on medicinal products seems to be modeled on single (or combinations of single) molecule products. On the other hand, Regulation 2017/745/EC on medical devices seems to apply to complex substances without derogating on quality, efficacy, and safety. The regulation specifically names and strengthens medical devices that include substances, mostly of natural origin, introducing the official term ""medical devices made of substances"".

We evaluated a national, multihospital patient data base to examine recent trends in ruptured aneurysm therapies and to compare peri-procedural outcomes between clipping and coiling treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Premier Perspective data base was used to identify patients hospitalized between 2006-2011 for ruptured aneurysm who underwent clipping or coiling therapy. A propensity score model, representing the probability of receiving clipping, was generated for each patient by use of relevant patient and hospital variables. After Greedy-type matching of the propensity score, the risk of in-hospital mortality and morbidity was compared between clipping and coiling cohorts. RESULTS A total of 5229 patients with ruptured aneurysm (1228 clipping, 4001 coiling) treated at 125 hospitals were identified. Clipping therapy frequency decreased from 27% in 2006 to 21% in 2011. After propensity score adjustment, in-hospital mortality risk was similar between groups (OR = 0.94 [95% CI, 0.73-1.21]; P = .62). However, unfavorable outcomes were more common after clipping compared with coiling, including discharge to long-term care (OR = 1.32 [95% CI, 1.12-1.56]; P = .0006), ischemic complications (OR = 1.51 [95% CI, 1.24-1.83]; P = .0009), neurologic complications (OR = 1.64 [95% CI, 1.18-2.27]; P = .0018), and other surgical complications (OR = 1.55 [95% CI, 1.05-2.33]; P = .0240). CONCLUSIONS This study of a data base of multiple hospitals in the United States demonstrates that clipping of ruptured cerebral aneurysms resulted in greater adjusted morbidity compared with coiling.","McDonald, J S; McDonald, R J; Fan, J; Kallmes, D F; Lanzino, G; Cloft, H J",AJNR.

This study aimed to determine the influence of cigarette smoking and COPD on the cellular phenotype of circulating monocytes. Thirty-two patients with COPD and 36 healthy volunteers (n = 17 and 19 in nonsmokers and smokers with normal lung functions, respectively) were enrolled in this study. The expression of two cell surface markers, pro-inflammatory-related S100A9 and anti-inflammatory-related CD163, on classical monocytes was analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of CD14strongCD16- classical monocytes in circulating monocytes showed no difference among the three groups. The percentage of S100A9+, S100A9+CD163-, and S100A9+CD163+ cells in classical monocytes was significantly increased in COPD patients relative to nonsmoker controls. In contrast, the levels of S100A9-CD163+ cells were significantly decreased in smokers with normal lung functions and in COPD patients relative to that in nonsmokers. Multivariate analyses revealed an independent association between S100A9+ cell rates and COPD (exponent 1.0336, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0063-1.0617, p value < 0.05). In Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, the ratio of S100A9+CD163-/S100A9-CD163+ cells yielded a receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve of 0.719 (95% CI = 0.567-0.871) for discrimination between smokers with normal lung functions and COPD patients. In conclusion, our results demonstrated increased pro-inflammatory phenotypes in circulating classical monocytes in COPD, providing novel insights to elucidate their roles in the pathogenesis of COPD.

This is achieved through the targeting and regulation of complementary RNA transcripts and has a well-documented role in post-transcriptional gene regulation and transposon repression. DICER1 deficiency results in dysregulation of miRNAs, changing the expression of many genes. DICER1 syndrome represents a collection of benign and malignant tumours arising from an autosomally inherited germline mutation leading to an inherited predisposition to cancer. The syndrome represents an unusual form of Knudson's two-hit hypothesis, where individuals with a pathogenic germline DICER1 variant acquire a second trans-somatic missense DICER1 mutation. This somatic mutation appears to have to occur in one of five hotspots codons and may contribute towards the incomplete penetrance observed within DICER1 syndrome families. In this case, DICER1 is haploinsuffcient with only one deletion required and partial loss of function being advantageous to tumours over complete loss of function. As increasing data emerge reaffirming the pivotal role of DICER1 in the maintenance of human physiology, DICER1 is likely to become an increasingly attractive target for novel therapeutic strategies.","Thunders, Michelle; Delahunt, Brett",Journal of clinical pathology,678,31

To date, although a number of bioinformatics tools have been developed for location discovery of m6A modification, functional understanding is still quite limited. As the focus of RNA epigenetics gradually shifts from site discovery to functional studies, there is an urgent need for user-friendly tools to identify and explore the functional relevance of context-specific m6A methylation to gain insights into the epitranscriptome layer of gene expression regulation. RESULTS We introduced here Funm6AViewer, a novel platform to identify, prioritize, and visualize the functional gene interaction networks mediated by dynamic m6A RNA methylation unveiled from a case control study. By taking the differential RNA methylation (DM) data and differential gene expression (DE) data, both of which can be inferred from the widely used MeRIP-seq data, as the inputs, Funm6AViewer enables a series of analysis, including: (1) examining the distribution of differential m6A sites, (2) prioritizing the genes mediated by dynamic m6A methylation, and (3) characterizing functionally the gene regulatory networks mediated by condition-specific m6A RNA methylation. Funm6AViewer should effectively facilitate the understanding of the epitranscriptome circuitry mediated by this reversible RNA modification.

METHODS/DESIGN We will conduct a systematic review of randomized clinical trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis. The participants will be adult (as defined in the included trials) critically ill patients. The intervention will be any corticosteroid administered systematically for >24 hours and the comparator will be placebo or no treatment. The primary outcome will be rate of clinically important GI bleeding. We will systematically search EMBASE, MEDLINE, Medline In-Process, Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos and trial registries for relevant literature, as well as perform a hand search.

CONCLUSION Adherence to a standardized operative protocol and expert mentorship allows this technically demanding operation to be associated with low conversion and complication rates. The absence of any difference between procedures performed by a trainee or trained surgeon suggests that the operation can be included in training programmes for laparoscopic surgery.","Leroy, J; Costantino, F; Cahill, R A; D'Agostino, J; Wu, W H S; Mutter, D; Marescaux, J",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,678,0
117151,117151,117151,Topic: Mesh and Prosthesis.,9.303221,3.3022194,2015,"Viruses use the cellular machinery of their hosts for replication. It has therefore been proposed that the nucleotide and dinucleotide compositions of viruses should match those of their host species. If this is upheld, it may then be possible to use dinucleotide composition to predict the true host species of viruses sampled in metagenomic surveys. However, it is also clear that different taxonomic groups of viruses tend to have distinctive patterns of dinucleotide composition that may be independent of host species. To determine the relative strength of the effect of host versus virus family in shaping dinucleotide composition, we performed a comparative analysis of 20 RNA virus families from 15 host groupings, spanning two animal phyla and more than 900 virus species. In particular, we determined the odds ratios for the 16 possible dinucleotides and performed a discriminant analysis to evaluate the capability of virus dinucleotide composition to predict the correct virus family or host taxon from which it was isolated. Notably, while 81% of the data analyzed here were predicted to the correct virus family, only 62% of these data were predicted to their correct subphylum/class host and a mere 32% to their correct mammalian order. Similarly, dinucleotide composition has a weak predictive power for different hosts within individual virus families. We therefore conclude that dinucleotide composition is generally uniform within a virus family but less well reflects that of its host species. This has obvious implications for attempts to accurately predict host species from virus genome sequences alone.IMPORTANCE Determining the processes that shape virus genomes is central to understanding virus evolution and emergence. One question of particular importance is why nucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies differ so markedly between viruses. In particular, it is currently unclear whether host species or virus family has the biggest impact on dinucleotide frequencies and whether dinucleotide composition can be used to accurately predict host species. Using a comparative analysis, we show that dinucleotide composition has a strong phylogenetic association across different RNA virus families, such that dinucleotide composition can predict the family from which a virus sequence has been isolated. Conversely, dinucleotide composition has a poorer predictive power for the different host species within a virus family and across different virus families, indicating that the host has a relatively small impact on the dinucleotide composition of a virus genome.","Di Giallonardo, Francesca; Schlub, Timothy E; Shi, Mang; Holmes, Edward C",Journal of virology,678,17

Objective To describe weight regain after reaching nadir weight following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery and compare weight regain measures for association with outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective cohort study of 2458 adults who underwent bariatric surgery at 10 hospitals in 6 US cities between March 2006 and April 2009. Assessments were conducted within 30 days' presurgery, at 6 months' postsurgery, and then annually until January 2015. Of the 1703 participants who underwent RYGB surgery, 1406 (83%) were followed up for 5 years or longer and had 5 or more weight measurements (excluding those who died or underwent surgical reversal). Exposures Weight regain assessed by 5 continuous measures (weight in kilograms, body mass index [BMI], percentage of presurgery weight, percentage of nadir weight, and percentage of maximum weight lost) and 8 dichotomous measures (per established thresholds) were compared in relation to clinical outcomes based on statistical significance, magnitude of association, and model fit. Main Outcomes and Measures Progression of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension and declines in physical and mental health-related quality of life and satisfaction with surgery. Results Among the 1406 participants who underwent RYGB surgery, the median age was 47 years (25th-75th percentile, 38-55 years) and the median BMI was 46.3 (25th-75th percentile, 42.3-51.8) prior to surgery. Most participants were female (80.3%) and white (85.6%). The median follow-up was 6.6 years (25th-75th percentile, 5.9-7.0 years). The median percentage of maximum weight loss was 37.4% (25th-75th percentile, 31.6%-43.3%) of presurgery weight and occurred a median of 2.0 years after RYGB surgery (25th-75th percentile, 1.0-3.2 years). The rate of weight regain was highest during the first year after reaching nadir weight, but weight regain continued to increase throughout follow-up (range, a median of 9.5% of maximum weight lost [25th-75th percentile, 4.7%-17.2%] to 26.8% of maximum weight lost [25th-75th percentile, 16.7%-41.5%] 1 to 5 years after reaching nadir weight). The percentage of participants who regained weight depended on threshold (eg, 5 years after nadir weight, 43.6% regained ≥5 BMI points; 50.2% regained ≥15% of nadir weight; and 67.3% regained ≥20% of maximum weight lost). Compared with other continuous weight regain measures, the percentage of maximum weight lost had the strongest association and best model fit for all outcomes except hyperlipidemia, which had a slightly stronger association with BMI. Of the dichotomous measures, 20% or greater of maximum weight lost performed better or similarly with most of the outcomes, and was the second best measure for hyperlipidemia (after ≥10 kg of weight) and hypertension (after ≥10% of maximum weight lost). Conclusions and Relevance Among a large cohort of adults who underwent RYGB surgery, weight regain quantified as percentage of maximum weight lost performed better for association with most clinical outcomes than the alternatives examined. These findings may inform standardizing the measurement of weight regain in studies of bariatric surgery.","King, Wendy C; Hinerman, Amanda S; Belle, Steven H; Wahed, Abdus S; Courcoulas, Anita P",JAMA,678,23

Several articles have shown how to translate from a standardized mortality ratio or hazard ratio to a longevity difference, a difference in actuarial ages, or a probability of being outlived. This note describes the settings when these translations are and are not appropriate, and provides some heuristics behind the formulae. The tools that yield differences in 'effective age' and in longevity are applicable when both (i) the mortality rate ratio (hazard ratio) is constant over age and (ii) the rates themselves are log-linear in age. The 'probability/odds of being outlived' metric is applicable whenever (i) holds, and thus provides no direct information on the magnitude of the effective age/longevity difference.","Pang, Menglan; Hanley, James A",American journal of epidemiology,678,1

Egypt is aiming for Universal Health Coverage; this increases the demand of telehealth in routine health services. OBJECTIVE to measure the awareness of telehealth health care workers of primary health care units and to evaluate the effect of an orientation program on primary health care workers' awareness and acceptance of application of telehealth. METHODOLOGY This was an intervention study among health care workers. A self-administrated valid questionnaire for health care workers was designed, the questionnaire consists of different domains of knowledge in addition to advantages, disadvantages, security and necessity perceptions. Each domain consists of Likert scale questions of 5 points. The questions were scored as the worst answer (1) and the best (5). A total of 109 questionnaires were filled by participants who spent at least 6 months in primary health care units. Then the health care workers were attended an orientation program and the questionnaire was re-filled once more. A total of 104 was recollected. Ethical issues were considered. RESULTS 50.5% of health care workers were aware of telehealth; 66.7% of health care workers with master's degree were aware of telehealth in comparison to 31.8% among those with a diploma, 64.3% of physicians were aware of telehealth while 9.6% of nurses were aware. The score of knowledge and attitude increased from 130±23.538 to 156.49±18.456 after the educational program.

However, specific tools and interventions are needed for people with severe mental illness (SMI) who have a life-threatening illness. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the scientific evidence on tools and interventions in palliative care for this group. METHODS Systematic searches were done in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Embase databases, supplemented by reference tracking, searches on the internet with free text terms, and consultations with experts to identify relevant literature. Empirical studies with qualitative, quantitative or mixed-methods designs concerning tools and interventions for use in palliative care for people with SMI were included. Methodological quality was assessed using a critical appraisal instrument for heterogeneous study designs. Stepwise study selection and the assessment of methodological quality were done independently by two review authors. RESULTS Four studies were included, reporting on a total of two tools and one multi-component intervention. One study concerned a tool to identify the palliative phase in patients with SMI. This tool appeared to be usable only in people with SMI with a cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, two related studies focused on a tool to involve people with SMI in discussions about medical decisions at the end of life. This tool was assessed as feasible and usable in the target group. One other study concerned the Dutch national Care Standard for palliative care, including a multi-component intervention. The Palliative Care Standard also appeared to be feasible and usable in a mental healthcare setting, but required further tailoring to suit this specific setting. None of the included studies investigated the effects of the tools and interventions on quality of life or quality of care. CONCLUSIONS Studies of palliative care tools and interventions for people with SMI are scarce. The existent tools and intervention need further development and should be tailored to the care needs and settings of these people. Further research is needed on the feasibility, usability and effects of tools and interventions for palliative care for people with SMI.","den Boer, Karin; de Veer, Anke J E; Schoonmade, Linda J; Verhaegh, Kim J; van Meijel, Berno; Francke, Anneke L",BMC psychiatry,678,7

However, there are uncertainties pertaining to the risks of post-bariatric severe hypoglycaemia (SH), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), end-stage kidney diseases (ESKDs) and all-cause mortality in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), especially among Asian populations. METHODS A retrospective population-based cohort of 1702 obese T2DM patients who were free of CVD and ESKD were assembled based on the 2006-17 Hospital Authority database. One-to-five propensity-score matching was used to balance baseline covariates between patients in bariatric surgery and control groups. Incidence rates (IRs) of SH, CVD, Stage 4/5 chronic kidney diseases (CKD), ESKD and all-cause mortality events for two groups were calculated. Hazard ratios (HR) for SH, CVD and Stage 4/5 CKD events were assessed using Cox-proportional hazard models. Changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured up to 60 months. RESULTS Over a mean follow-up period of 32 months with 5725 person-years, cumulative incidences of mortality, CVD, Stage 4/5 CKD, ESKD and SH were 0, 0.036, 0.050, 0.017 and 0.020, respectively. The surgery group had a significant reduction in risk of CVD events (HR = 0.464, P = 0.015) and no occurrence of mortality events. However, there were no significant differences in risks of SH [HR = 0.469, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.204-1.081], Stage 4/5 CKD (HR =0.896, 95% CI: 0.519-1.545) and ESKD (HR = 0.666, 95% CI: 0.264-1.683) between two groups, although IRs were lower in the surgery group. Surgical patients had significantly higher eGFR within 12 months and had significantly lower UACR until 48 months. CONCLUSIONS Among obese T2DM patients, bariatric surgery lowered the risk of CVD and mortality, and was beneficial towards the kidney outcomes.","Wong, Carlos K H; Wu, Tingting; Wong, Simon K H; Law, Betty T T; Grieve, Eleanor; Ng, Enders K W; Wu, Olivia; Lam, Cindy L K","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",678,0

This study investigated ETC experiences and critical care policies for patients with viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF). DESIGN A 58-item questionnaire elicited information on policies for 9 critical care interventions, factors that limited care provision, and innovations developed to deliver care. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS The questionnaire was sent to 82 ETCs. METHODS We analyzed ordinal and categorical data pertaining to the ETC characteristics and descriptive data about their policies and perceived challenges. Statistical analyses assessed whether ETCs with experience caring for VHF patients were more likely to have critical care policies than those that did not. RESULTS Of the 27 ETCs who responded, 17 (63%) were included. Among them, 8 (47%) reported experience caring for persons under investigation or confirmed cases of VHF. Most felt ready to provide intubation, chest compressions, and renal replacement therapy to these patients. The factors most cited for limiting care were staff safety and clinical futility. Innovations developed to better provide care included increased simulation training and alternative technologies for procedures and communication. CONCLUSIONS There were broad similarities in critical care policies and limitations among institutions. There were several interventions, namely ECMO and cricothyrotomy, which few institutions felt ready to provide. Future studies could identify obstacles to providing these interventions and explore policy changes after increased experience with novel infectious diseases, such as COVID-19.","DiLorenzo, Madeline A; Baker, Christoph A; Herstein, Jocelyn J; Evans, Laura; Lowe, John J; Gibbs, Shawn G; Bhadelia, Nahid",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,678,11

Importantly, although ADEP-activated ClpP is assumed to target multiple polypeptide and protein substrates in the bacterial cell, not all proteins seem equally susceptible. In Bacillus subtilis, the cell division protein FtsZ emerged to be particularly sensitive to degradation by ADEP-activated ClpP at low inhibitory ADEP concentrations. In fact, FtsZ is the only bacterial protein that has been confirmed to be degraded in vitro as well as within bacterial cells so far. However, the molecular reason for this preferred degradation remained elusive. Here, we report the unexpected finding that ADEP-activated ClpP alone, in the absence of any Clp-ATPase, leads to an unfolding and subsequent degradation of the N-terminal domain of FtsZ, which can be prevented by the stabilization of the FtsZ fold via nucleotide binding. At elevated antibiotic concentrations, importantly, the C terminus of FtsZ is notably targeted for degradation in addition to the N terminus. Our results show that different target structures are more or less accessible to ClpP, depending on the ADEP level present. Moreover, our data assign a Clp-ATPase-independent protein unfolding capability to the ClpP core of the bacterial Clp protease and suggest that the protein fold of FtsZ may be more flexible than previously anticipated.IMPORTANCE Acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) antibiotics effectively kill multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The antibacterial activity of ADEP depends on a new mechanism of action, i.e., the deregulation of bacterial protease ClpP that leads to bacterial self-digestion. Our data allow new insights into the mode of ADEP action by providing a molecular explanation for the distinct bacterial phenotypes observed at low versus high ADEP concentrations. In addition, we show that ClpP alone, in the absence of any unfoldase or energy-consuming system, and only activated by the small molecule antibiotic ADEP, leads to the unfolding of the cell division protein FtsZ.","Silber, Nadine; Pan, Stefan; Schäkermann, Sina; Mayer, Christian; Brötz-Oesterhelt, Heike; Sass, Peter",mBio,678,27

These economical compounds were used as antimalarial agents for many years. Currently, they are used as monotherapy or in conjunction with other therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjögren's syndrome (SS) and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). Based on its effects on the modulation of the autophagy process, various clinical studies suggest that CQ and HCQ could be used in combination with other chemotherapeutics for the treatment of various types of cancer. Furthermore, the antiviral effects showed against Zika, Chikungunya, and HIV are due to the annulation of endosomal/lysosomal acidification. Recently, CQ and HCQ were approved for The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of infected patients with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing the disease originated in December 2019, namely COVID-2019. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pharmacological effects of these drugs: 1) disruption of lysosomal and endosomal pH, 2) inhibition of protein secretion/expression, 3) inhibition of antigen presentation, 4) decrease of proinflammatory cytokines, 5) inhibition of autophagy, 6) induction of apoptosis and 7) inhibition of ion channels activation.

This provides opportunities to observe changes in sports bettors' behaviour when their primary form of activity is removed and assess the impact of Covid-19 related circumstances upon gambling. METHODS In July 2020, we conducted an online cross-sectional survey of people who bet regularly (at least monthly) on sports before Covid-19 (n = 3866). Bi-variate analyses compared changes in gambling behaviours before and during the initial lockdown. Multi-variate logistic regression models explored associations between problem gambling (men) and moderate risk or problem gambling (MRPG) (women) with changes in Covid-19 related circumstances and changing gambling behaviours during Britain's initial 'lockdown' (March-June 2020). RESULTS 29.8% of male sports bettors and 33.4% of female sports bettors stopped gambling altogether during the initial Covid-19 lockdown, though 17.3% of men and 16.5% of women started a new form of gambling during lockdown. Among men, adjusted odds ratios of problem gambling were higher among those starting a new gambling activity during lockdown (OR = 2.50 [95% CI 1.38-4.53]). Among women, adjusted odds ratios of MRPG were higher among those whose frequency of gambling on any activity increased during lockdown (OR = 4.21 [1.99-8.92] and among those shielding for health reasons. Poorer wellbeing was associated with problem gambling for men and MRPG for women.

Therefore, this rapid and unpredictable deterioration requires timely prediction of COVID-19 refractoriness and critical illness. The two biomarkers readily available in routine laboratories, blood lymphocytes and neutrophil counts, are expected to provide an accurate clinical tool to incline reasonable medication and care because lymphopenia marks immune exhaustion while neutrophilia demonstrates the immunological exuberation.

We hypothesized that IL-8/CXCR2 signalling promotes tumour progression in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS We examined the relationship between IL-8/CXCR2 expression and clinicopathological factors by immunohistochemistry in samples from 63 patients with resectable ESCC. The effects of IL-8/CXCR2 signalling on cell proliferation and gene expression were examined in vitro and in vivo using ESCC cell lines. RESULTS Increased IL-8/CXCR2 signalling was associated with shorter overall survival (p<0.05) and recurrence-free survival (p<0.05) in ESCC patients. Multivariate analysis identified IL-8/CXCR2 expression as a prognostic factor for surgically treated ESCC (p<0.05). In vitro, IL-8 exposure or over-expression significantly enhanced ESCC cell proliferation. SB225002, a CXCR2-specific antagonist, and IL-8 siRNA significantly suppressed cell proliferation. CONCLUSION IL-8/CXCR2 expression is an independent prognostic factor for surgically treated ESCC, and IL-8/CXCR2 signalling contributes to ESCC cell proliferation.","Inoue, Masazumi; Takeuchi, Hiroya; Matsuda, Sachiko; Nishi, Tomohiko; Fukuda, Kazumasa; Nakamura, Rieko; Takahashi, Tsunehiro; Wada, Norihito; Kawakubo, Hirofumi; Kitagawa, Yuko",Anticancer research,678,31

To evaluate by L-BIA, the severity of MTJ injuries graded from 1 to 3, and to determine the relationship between days to return to play (RTP) and L-BIA measurements. Methods 3T MRI and tetra polar L-BIA was used to analyzed 37 muscle injuries 24 h after injury in 32 male professional football players, (23.5 ± 1.5 kg m-2; 1.8 ± 0.1 m; 20-30 year.) between the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons. Muscle injuries were classified by The British Athletics Muscle Injury Classification (BAMIC). Percentage difference of L-BIA parameters [resistance (R), reactance (Xc), and phase angle (PA)] of the injured side were calculated considering contralateral non-injured side as the reference value. Results According to BAMIC classification and by MRI exam, we found tendinous (n = 4), MTJ (n = 26), and MFJ (n = 7) muscle injuries. In addition, MTJ injuries were grouped according to the severity of injury in grade 1 (n = 11), grade 2 (n = 8), and grade 3 (n = 7). Significant decrease (P < 0.01) was found in the L-BIA parameters R, Xc, and PA, in both MTJ and MFJ as well as in the different grades of MTJ injuries. In particular, in Xc (P < 0.001), which is related to muscle cell disruption. Regarding days to RTP, there was statistical significance among the three different grades of MTJ injuries (P < 0.001), especially when grade 1 was compared to grade 3 and grade 2 compared to 3. Conclusion L-BIA is a complementary method to imaging diagnostic techniques, such as MRI and US, to quantify MTJ and MFJ injuries. In addition, the increase in the severity of the MTJ injury resulted in higher changes of the Xc parameter and longer time to RTP.","Nescolarde, Lexa; Terricabras, Joaquim; Mechó, Sandra; Rodas, Gil; Yanguas, Javier",Frontiers in physiology,678,17

These functions are affected by the presence of beta-Amyloid (Aβ) deposits, hallmark lesions of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recently demonstrated that exchanging functionally altered endogenous microglia with peripheral myeloid cells did not change Aβ-burden in a mouse model mimicking aspects of AD at baseline, and only mildly reduced Aβ plaques upon stimulation. To better characterize these different myeloid cell populations, we used long-term in vivo 2-photon microscopy to compare morphology and basic functional parameters of brain populating peripherally-derived myeloid cells and endogenous microglia. While peripherally-derived myeloid cells exhibited increased process movement in the non-diseased brain, the Aβ rich environment in an AD-like mouse model, which induced an alteration of surveillance functions in endogenous microglia, also restricted functional characteristics and response to CNS injury of newly recruited peripherally-derived myeloid cells. Our data demonstrate that the Aβ rich brain environment alters the functional characteristics of endogenous microglia as well as newly recruited peripheral myeloid cells, which has implications for the role of myeloid cells in disease and the utilization of these cells in Alzheimer's disease therapy.","Drost, Natalia; Houtman, Judith; Cseresnyés, Zoltán; Niesner, Raluca; Rinnenthal, Jan-Leo; Miller, Kelly R; Prokop, Stefan; Heppner, Frank L",Scientific reports,678,1

Recently, individual differences in behavior, such as exploration, were shown to be linked to how prone an individual may be to contrafreeload. In this work, our main objective was to test whether and how individual differences in range use of free-range broiler chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) were related to the individual motivation to contrafreeload. We also verified whether other behavioral variations could relate to range use. To that aim, over three different periods (before range access, first weeks of range access, and last weeks of range access), chickens with different ranging levels (low and high rangers) were submitted to a contrafreeloading test and had different behaviors recorded (such as foraging, resting, locomotion) in their home environment. During the contrafreeloading test, chickens were conditioned to one chamber presenting a foraging substrate and mealworms, while in the other chamber, mealworms were freely available on the floor. During testing trials, chickens had access to both empty chambers, and the time spent in each chamber was quantified. On average, low rangers preferred the chamber where mealworms were easily accessible (without the foraging substrate), while high rangers preferred the chamber where mealworms were accessible with difficulty, showing greater contrafreeloading. Out of ten behaviors recorded in chickens' home environment, foraging was the only one that differed significantly between our two ranging groups, with low rangers foraging, on average, significantly less than high rangers. These results corroborate previous experiences suggesting that range use is probably linked to chickens' exploratory trait and suggest that individual differences in free-range broiler chickens are present even before range access. Increasing our knowledge of individual particularities is a necessary step to improve free-range chicken welfare on the farm.","Ferreira, Vitor Hugo Bessa; Simoni, Arthur; Germain, Karine; Leterrier, Christine; Lansade, Léa; Collin, Anne; Mignon-Grasteau, Sandrine; Le Bihan-Duval, Elisabeth; Guettier, Elodie; Leruste, Hélène; Calandreau, Ludovic; Guesdon, Vanessa",Scientific reports,678,1

The decision to stop anticoagulant therapy (AT) after the initial 3-6 months or to continue AT indefinitely, is primarily governed by the long-term risk of recurrence when treatment is discontinued. This risk however, is not well established, hindering decision making. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review and a meta-analysis of studies involving patients diagnosed with a first, symptomatic unprovoked VTE or VTE provoked by minor transient risk factors, who have completed at least 3 months of initial AT; and who were followed-up for standardised time intervals of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 years (±3 months) after stopping AT. We will search (from inception to January 2017) MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane library for randomised controlled trials and prospective observational studies. Two reviewers will conduct all screening and data collection independently. The primary outcome of the rate of recurrent VTE at the standardised time intervals will be calculated for each study from the total number of recurrent events and the corresponding number of patient-years of follow-up. We will use a random-effects model to pool study results and report a weighted estimate of the absolute rate of recurrent VTE (events per 100 patient-years) over standardised time intervals of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 years after discontinuing anticoagulants.

Data from studies in large cohorts on the efficacy and safety of multiple immediate endovascular interventions are sparse. Our aim was to assess the feasibility and safety of multiple repeat instant endovascular interventions in patients with cerebral vasospasm refractory to medical, hemodynamic, and initial endovascular interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a single-center retrospective study of prospectively collected data on patients with cerebral vasospasm refractory to therapies requiring ≥3 endovascular interventions during the course of treatment following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The primary end point was functional outcome at last follow-up (mRS ≤2). The secondary end point was angiographic response to endovascular therapies and the appearance of cerebral infarctions. RESULTS During a 4-year period, 365 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were treated at our institution. Thirty-one (8.5%) met the inclusion criteria. In 52 (14%) patients, ≤2 endovascular interventions were performed as rescue therapy for refractory cerebral vasospasm. At last follow-up, a good outcome was noted in 18 (58%) patients with ≥3 interventions compared with 31 (61%) of those with ≤2 interventions (P = .82). The initial Hunt and Hess score of ≤2 was a significant independent predictor of good outcome (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.2-18.5; P = .03), whereas infarcts in eloquent brain areas were significantly associated with a poor outcome (mRS 3-6; OR, 13.5; 95% CI, 2.3-81.2; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS Repeat instant endovascular intervention is an aggressive but feasible last resort treatment strategy with a favorable outcome in two-thirds of patients with refractory cerebral vasospasm and in whom endovascular treatment has already been initiated.","Andereggen, L; Beck, J; Z'Graggen, W J; Schroth, G; Andres, R H; Murek, M; Haenggi, M; Reinert, M; Raabe, A; Gralla, J",AJNR.

OBJECTIVE To compare learning curves of transradial versus transfemoral diagnostic cerebral angiograms obtained by five neurovascular fellows as primary operator. METHODS The first 100-150 consecutive transradial and transfemoral angiographic scans performed by each fellow between July 2017 and March 2020 were identified. Mean fluoroscopy time per artery injected (angiographic efficiency) was calculated as a marker of technical proficiency and compared for every 25 consecutive procedures performed (eg, 1-25, 26-50, 51-75). RESULTS We identified 1242 diagnostic angiograms, 607 transradial and 635 transfemoral. The radial cohort was older (64.3 years vs 62.3 years, p=0.01) and demonstrated better angiographic efficiency (3.4 min/vessel vs 3.7 min/vessel, p=0.03). For three fellows without previous endovascular experience, proficiency was obtained between 25 and 50 transfemoral angiograms. One fellow achieved proficiency after performing 25-50 transradial angiograms; and the two other fellows, in <25 transradial angiograms. The two fellows with previous experience had flattened learning curves for both access types. Two patients experienced transient neurologic symptoms postprocedure. Transradial angiograms were associated with significantly fewer access-site complications (3/607, 0.5% vs 22/635, 3.5%, p<0.01). Radial-to-femoral conversion occurred in 1.2% (7/607); femoral-to-radial conversion occurred in 0.3% (2/635). Over time, the proportion of transradial angiographic procedures increased. CONCLUSION Technical proficiency improved significantly over time for both access types, typically requiring between 25 and 50 diagnostic angiograms to achieve asymptomatic improvement in efficiency. Reduced access-site complications and decreased fluoroscopy time were benefits associated with transradial angiography.","Tso, Michael K; Rajah, Gary B; Dossani, Rimal H; Meyer, Michael J; McPheeters, Matthew J; Vakharia, Kunal; Waqas, Muhammad; Snyder, Kenneth V; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Davies, Jason M",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,678,7

However, the mechanisms underlying the procedure remain incompletely understood. Intestinal remodeling involving glucose transporters (GLUTs) may play a crucial role. Rat studies have demonstrated morphological adaptation of GLUTs within adipose and intestinal cells in association with the reprogramming of glucose metabolism. There is a limited understanding of the variations in expression amongst GLUT family receptors in the human intestine. The aim of this study was to evaluate and describe jejunal GLUT expression patterns in the obese versus non-obese. METHODS Tissue samples were collected from 19 adults (age ≥18) patients with morbid obesity undergoing elective RYGB. Specimens were obtained from excess jejunum removed during the stapled jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. All subjects met National Institutes of Health criteria for bariatric surgery (body mass index or BMI ≥40 or ≥35 with obesity-related comorbidities). Exclusion criteria included age less than 18, age greater than 65, patients undergoing a revision procedure, and the presence of a seizure disorder (possible association with GLUT-1 deficiency syndrome). Five samples were obtained from non-obese subjects (average BMI 26.7) without diabetes who were consenting organ donors after brain death. Samples of jejunum from non-obese individuals were obtained at the time of organ procurement. Institutional Review Board and Gift of Hope approval was obtained. Specimens underwent quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. Western blot densitometry was performed using Image J software. Student T test was performed using SPSS statistics software. RESULTS GLUT-1 and GLUT-7 expression were not detected in the jejunum of either group. No difference in expression pattern was observed for GLUT-2, GLUT-4, and GLUT-9 between the groups. Western blot band density of GLUT-5 to loading control (GADPH) mean ratio was 0.21 (SD = 0.20) in obese specimens compared to 0.56 (SD = 0.17) in non-obese. Densitometry revealed GLUT-5 levels in the jejunum of the obese were significantly lower than non-obese specimens (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION The absence of GLUT-1 expression in both the obese and non-obese groups is consistent with the established view of GLUT-1 being abundantly present in fetal intestine but diminished to negligible levels by adulthood. Decreased GLUT-5 expression in samples from subjects with obesity compared to non-obese samples may represent a down-regulation of gene expression amongst the obese. The differential expression of GLUT-5 suggests a possible role in obesity. Studies of GLUT family expression will aid in understanding the impact of intestinal remodeling on obesity.","Deal, Rebecca A; Tang, Yueming; Fletcher, Reid; Torquati, Alfonso; Omotosho, Philip",Surgical endoscopy,678,1

We also examined the relationships between the effects of fluticasone propionate and various signalling pathways in the cells. Twenty-four hours after infection (1MOI), RSV-infected cells released cytokines, for example proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α), anti-inflammatory (IL-1ra), Th1 (IFN-γ, IFN-λ1a, IL-2 and IL-12), Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13), granulopoiesis-inducing (G-CSF and GM-CSF), eosinophil recruitment-inducing (eotaxin and RANTES) and neutrophil recruitment-inducing cytokines (IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1 and MIP-1α).

TLR-4 expression was unchanged in control and RSV-infected cells, and TLR-3 and RIG-I expression was not detected.

The skills necessary to perform robotic surgery are unique from those required in open and laparoscopic surgery. A validated laparoscopic surgical skills curriculum (Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery or FLS™) has transformed the way surgeons acquire laparoscopic skills. There is a need for a similar skills training and assessment tool for robotic surgery. Our research group previously developed and validated a robotic training curriculum in a virtual reality (VR) simulator. We hypothesized that novice robotic surgeons could achieve proficiency levels defined by more experienced robotic surgeons on the VR robotic curriculum, and that this would result in improved performance on the actual daVinci Surgical System™. METHODS 25 medical students with no prior robotic surgery experience were recruited. Prior to VR training, subjects performed 2 FLS tasks 3 times each (Peg Transfer, Intracorporeal Knot Tying) using the daVinci Surgical System™ docked to a video trainer box. Task performance for the FLS tasks was scored objectively. Subjects then practiced on the VR simulator (daVinci Skills Simulator) until proficiency levels on all 5 tasks were achieved before completing a post-training assessment of the 2 FLS tasks on the daVinci Surgical System™ in the video trainer box. RESULTS All subjects to complete the study (1 dropped out) reached proficiency levels on all VR tasks in an average of 71 (± 21.7) attempts, accumulating 164.3 (± 55.7) minutes of console training time. There was a significant improvement in performance on the robotic FLS tasks following completion of the VR training curriculum. CONCLUSIONS Novice robotic surgeons are able to attain proficiency levels on a VR simulator. This leads to improved performance in the daVinci surgical platform on simulated tasks. Training to proficiency on a VR robotic surgery simulator is an efficient and viable method for acquiring robotic surgical skills.","Bric, Justin; Connolly, Michael; Kastenmeier, Andrew; Goldblatt, Matthew; Gould, Jon C",Surgical endoscopy,678,1

The use of methylene blue to treat refractory shock in children is not well described. We aim to collect and summarize the literature and define physicians' practice patterns regarding the use of methylene blue to treat shock in children. DESIGN We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane for studies involving the use of methylene blue for catecholamine-refractory shock from database inception to 2019. Collected studies were analyzed qualitatively. To describe practice patterns of methylene blue use, we electronically distributed a survey to U.S.-based pediatric critical care physicians. We assessed physician knowledge and experience with methylene blue. Survey responses were quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. SETTING Pediatric critical and cardiac care units. PATIENTS OR SUBJECTS Patients less than or equal to 25 years old with refractory shock treated with methylene blue. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS One-thousand two-hundred ninety-three abstracts met search criteria, 139 articles underwent full-text review, and 24 studies were included. Studies investigated refractory shock induced by a variety of etiologies and found that methylene blue was generally safe and increased mean arterial blood pressure. There is overall lack of studies, low number of study patients, and low quality of studies identified. Our survey had a 22.5% response rate, representing 125 institutions. Similar proportions of physicians reported using (40%) or never even considering (43%) methylene blue for shock. The most common reasons for not using methylene blue were unfamiliarity with this drug, its proper dosing, and lack of evidentiary support. CONCLUSIONS Methylene blue appears safe and may benefit children with refractory shock. There is a stark divide in familiarity and practice patterns regarding its use among physicians. Studies to formally assess safety and efficacy of methylene blue in treating pediatric shock are warranted.","Otero Luna, Andrea V; Johnson, Rachel; Funaro, Melissa; Canarie, Michael F; Pierce, Richard W",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,678,8

METHOD Between February 2000 and July 2012, 608 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy at a single center. In September 2003, we began to perform the PLDN for the first time. A matched-pair cohort of 80 patients who underwent PLDN and 80 patients who underwent HALDN was selected for retrospective comparison. RESULT No significant differences in operative time, warm ischemia time, estimated blood loss, transfusion rate, analgesic requirement, or hospital stay were observed between the HALDN and PLDN groups. No differences were found in the recipient serum creatinine values (mg/dL) and estimated glomerular filtration rate by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD-eGFR; mL/min/1.73 m(2) ). CONCLUSION No significant differences were observed in surgical outcomes, complication rates, and postoperative parameters between the HALDN and PLDN groups. Moreover, recipient graft function and morbidity between both groups were comparable. Therefore, we believe that PLDN may be a good alternative technique to HALDN.","Choi, Sae Woong; Kim, Kang Sup; Kim, Seol; Choi, Yong Sun; Bae, Woong Jin; Hong, Sung-Hoo; Lee, Ji Youl; Kim, Sae Woong; Hwang, Tae-Kon; Cho, Hyuk Jin",Clinical transplantation,678,19

The full impact of this onslaught of grief will not be known for some time. Ensuring high quality bereavement care in the context of COVID-19 presents unprecedented challenges to end-of-life care. OBJECTIVES We aimed to determine how psychological symptoms explain functional impairment. METHODS A sample of people bereaved through COVID-19 (N = 307) in the United States completed demographic questions and self-report measures of neuroticism; symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, posttraumatic stress, separation distress, and dysfunctional grief; and functional impairment due to a COVID-19 loss. RESULTS Most participants' scores were in the clinical ranges for generalized anxiety, depression, dysfunctional grief, and functional impairment. Functional impairment scores were not associated with age, gender, and time since loss but were associated with being diagnosed with COVID-19, having received professional help with the loss, and a close relationship to the deceased. A logistic regression model showed that, after controlling for covariates, the odds of functional impairment significantly increased by 27% for higher scores in separation distress, 25% for higher scores in dysfunctional grief, and 13% for higher scores in posttraumatic stress. CONCLUSION People bereaved due to COVID-19 are at risk of functional impairment, especially if they have symptoms of separation distress, dysfunctional grief, and/or posttraumatic stress. Attention to identifying and treating functional impairment may be important in facilitating grieving persons' full participation in social and economic life during and after the pandemic.","Breen, Lauren J; Lee, Sherman A; Neimeyer, Robert A",Journal of pain and symptom management,678,28

In general surgery, locoregional anaesthesia was applied to laparoscopic procedures, increasing minimally invasive surgery advantages. AIMS To assess and compare postoperative pain after laparoscopic adnexal procedures for benign conditions under spinal anaesthesia (SA) versus general anaesthesia (GA). Furthermore, anaesthesiologic, surgical and clinical data were evaluated in both groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a prospective cohort study performed in a tertiary level referral centre for minimally invasive gynaecological surgery (Gynaecology and Human Reproduction Physiopathology, University of Bologna). Women scheduled for adnexal laparoscopic surgery for benign conditions between February and May 2019 were assigned to receive either SA or GA with endotracheal intubation. A sample size of 13 women per group was needed to detect a 2-point difference in pain scores. MAIN FINDINGS 13 women were enrolled in the SA arm, 15 in the GA arm. In the SA cohort, the most common intraoperative adverse event was shoulder pain, reported by 3/12 women. At 1, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after surgery pain was significantly lower in the SA arm (p < .05). Patients submitted to SA experienced no need for opioid drugs administration, unlike those receiving GA. Patients' mobilization and return of bowel function were noted significantly earlier in the SA group (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS SA is a feasible, safe and effective anaesthesiologic technique for laparoscopic gynaecological procedures for benign conditions, allowing a better control of postoperative pain. Women undergoing SA achieve earlier mobilization and bowel canalization. During the Covid-19 pandemics, SA could be useful in reducing the need for invasive procedures on respiratory tract.","Raimondo, Diego; Borghese, Giulia; Mastronardi, Manuela; Mabrouk, Mohamed; Salucci, Paolo; Lambertini, Agnese; Casadio, Paolo; Tonini, Claudia; Meriggiola, Maria Cristina; Arena, Alessandro; Tarozzi, Giulia; Seracchioli, Renato",Journal of gynecology obstetrics and human reproduction,678,16

Bariatric surgery has been an increasingly popular choice in the management of obesity, and the last five years have seen an enormous amount of research on the various procedures. Recently bariatric surgery has been recognized as an important modifier of the metabolic and hormonal states associated with obesity's comorbidities. Consequently, research regarding the effect of bariatric procedures on type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and the inflammatory state has become more plentiful. As bariatric surgery has matured, a growing body of evidence and experience has accrued. A change in the relative popularity of the four major laparoscopic bariatric procedures; sleeve gastrectomy, roux-en-Y gastric bypass, adjustable gastric band, and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch has taken place. This has been driven by technical factors, as well as the individual procedures' efficacy in weight-loss and improvement in comorbidities. Weight recidivism is an increasingly recognized problem as patients are followed for longer periods following their bariatric operations. This important and costly problem has roots in both technical and patient related factors.","Laffin, Michael; Karmali, Shahzeer",Current obesity reports,678,4

Health IT applications, such as electronic health records or decision-support systems, are meant to support both professionals and their support systems. However, for physicians using these applications, the applications often cause new problems, such as the impracticality of their use in clinical practice. This review adopts a social sciences perspective to understand these problems and derive suggestions for further development. Indeed, humans use tools to remediate the brain's weaknesses and enhance thinking. Available health IT tools have been shaped to fit administrative needs rather than physicians' needs. To increase the beneficial effect of health IT applications in health care, clinicians' style of thinking and their learning needs must be considered when designing and implementing such systems. New health IT tools must be shaped to fit health professionals' needs. To further ease the integration of new health IT tools into clinical practice, we must also consider the effects of implementing new tools on the wider social framework.","Wagner-Menghin, Michaela; Pokieser, Peter",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,678,1

Management of time length of a medical consultation with a patient with MM is a matter of concern for doctors. METHODS A systematic review was performed to describe the impact of MM on the average time of a medical consultation considering the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The systematic online searches of the Embase and PubMed databases were undertaken, from January 2000 to August 2018. The studies were independently screened by two reviewers to decide which ones met the inclusion criteria. (Kappa = 0.84 and Kappa = 0.82). Differing opinions were solved by a third person. This systematic review included people with MM criteria as participants (two or more chronic conditions in the same individual). The type of outcome included was explicitly defined - the length of medical appointments with patients with MM. Any strategies aiming to analyse the impact of MM on the average consultation time were considered. The length of time of medical appointment for patients without MM was the comparator criteria. Experimental and observational studies were included. RESULTS Of 85 articles identified, only 1 observational study was included, showing a clear trend for patients with MM to have longer consultations than patients without MM criteria (p < 0.001).

This flow-diversion device is being used in Europe for intracranial aneurysm treatment by aneurysm occlusion. The device construct creates an intracranial bypass conduit that reconstructs the parent vessel while maintaining patency of the perforating arteries and branch arteries. The investigators report the first two patients in which the SILK stent was used for intracranial aneurysms in the United States. CASE DESCRIPTION Two patients, one with a symptomatic giant posterior communicating artery aneurysm and one with a symptomatic fusiform vertebrobasilar junction and basilar artery aneurysm, were treated at two separate institutions with the device. A total of three SILK stents were placed in these patients. In the first patient, a single device was sufficient to cause immediate angiographic stasis within the posterior communicating artery aneurysm. However, reversal of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy was required due to a spontaneous bleed from an intercostal artery, and this led to in-stent thrombosis and major stroke. In the second patient, the placement of two devices resulted in immediate stasis of the basilar artery aneurysm. The patient remained on antiplatelet therapy and was discharged without complication. His follow-up angiogram at approximately 2 months showed complete occlusion of the aneurysm with parent vessel reconstruction. In both patients, immediate stasis was identified, and no immediate neurological complications occurred. However, in one patient, a complication occurred that was related to reversal of/cessation of antiplatelet therapy. CONCLUSION In this initial U.S. experience with SILK flow-diversion devices, these devices were deployed easily and immediate flow stasis in the aneurysm was achieved. Further evaluation of this device is needed at multiple centers with adequately trained and experienced operators.","Binning, Mandy J; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Bulsara, Ketan R; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Hopkins, L Nelson; Levy, Elad I",World neurosurgery,678,12

Presently, cataract surgery is the only treatment for cataract and is very effective in restoring sight. In cataract surgery, the natural lens of the eye that becomes clouded is removed and replaced with an artificial intraocular lens. There are multiple techniques for removal of lens as well as many types of intraocular lenses available for implantation. For this reason, it becomes imperative to monitor the impact of different surgical techniques and different intraocular lenses on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of the patients. This systematic review aims to evaluate HRQoL evidences on effects of different types of cataract surgeries and intraocular lenses on visual function and quality of life in age-related cataract patients. METHOD Databases like Cochrane, EMBASE, SCOPUS, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov , Current Controlled Trials and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) will be searched systematically. Two reviewers will independently screen studies using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria along with the extraction of data, and assessment of methodological quality using a standard checklist. DISCUSSION This systematic review will help in understanding how different types of cataract surgeries and intraocular lenses make a difference on quality of life of age-related cataract patients in terms of visual function and health-related quality of life. As the review attempts to bring together all the cataract-related HRQoL evidences pertaining to different cataract surgical techniques, different intraocular lenses and cataract-related complications, it will also identify gaps in evidence.

Intersectionality theory may help us to better understand the complex processes of multiple interlocking systems of oppression and privilege shaped by intersections of individuals' social categories. The objectives of this systematic scoping review were (1) to summarize the findings of articles examining PA claimed operationalization of intersectionality and (2) to identify the scope and gaps pertaining to the operationalization of intersectionality in PA research. A search was conducted in September 2019 in seven electronic databases (e.g., SPORTDiscus, Scopus, Web of Science) for relevant research articles written in English. Key search terms included ""intersectionality"" AND ""physical activity"" OR ""sport"". Database searches, data screening and extraction, and narrative synthesis were conducted between September 2019 and May 2020. Of 16564 articles identified, 45 articles were included in this review. The majority of included articles used qualitative methods (n = 41), with two quantitative and two mixed-methods articles. The most frequently observed intersectional social position was sex/gender + race/ethnicity (n = 11), followed by sex/gender + race/ethnicity + sexuality (n = 6) and sex/gender + race/ethnicity + religion (n = 6). Most qualitative studies (n = 38) explicitly claimed operationalization of intersectionality as a key theoretical framework, and over half of these studies (n = 27) implicitly used intra-categorical intersectionality. Two quantitative studies were identified which examined a number of intersections simultaneously using inter-categorical intersectionality. Complex processes of individual and social-structural level factors that drive inequalities in PA opportunities and participation could be better elucidated with the operationalization of intersectionality theory. Intersectionality theory may serve as a useful framework in both qualitative and quantitative investigations. Advancement in quantitative intersectionality is critical in order to produce knowledge that could inform more inclusive PA promotion efforts.","Lim, Heejun; Jung, Eun; Jodoin, Kaila; Du, XiaoWei; Airton, Lee; Lee, Eun-Young",SSM - population health,678,1

Sucrose licking response decreased progressively during pregnancy compared to that prior to mating, with partial recovery in the post-partum period. No change in taste morphology was evident between pregnant and non-pregnant mice, however a notable decrease in T1R3 sweet taste receptor expression was recorded in pregnant dams. We conclude that altered taste preferences during pregnancy likely result from changes in the expression profile of taste buds in the mother, which may promote a less healthy diet while expecting.","Choo, Ezen; Koh, Anna; Goodman, Jason; Bushnell, Jennifer; Mielke-Maday, Hanna; Merte, Bryan; Dando, Robin",Physiology & behavior,678,1

The purpose of the present study was to identify differences in thirty-day morbidity and mortality following primary total hip and total knee arthroplasty according to smoking status and pack-year history of smoking. METHODS We queried the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database to identify patients who had undergone primary total hip or total knee arthroplasty between 2006 and 2012. Patients were stratified by smoking status and pack-year history of smoking. Thirty-day rates of mortality, wound complications, and total complications were compared with use of univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS We identified 78,191 patients who had undergone primary total hip or total knee arthroplasty. Of these, 81.8% (63,971) were nonsmokers, 7.9% (6158) were former smokers, and 10.3% (8062) were current smokers. Current smokers had a higher rate of wound complications (1.8%) compared with former smokers and nonsmokers (1.3% and 1.1%, respectively; p < 0.001). Former smokers had a higher rate of total complications (6.9%) compared with current smokers and nonsmokers (5.9% and 5.4%, respectively; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified current smokers as being at increased risk of wound complications (odds ratio [OR], 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21 to 1.78), particularly deep wound infection, while both current smokers (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.31) and former smokers (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.34) were at increased total complication risk. Increasing pack-year history of smoking resulted in increasing total complication risk.

The mechanisms of asbestos carcinogenesis remain enigmatic, as exposure to asbestos induces HM death. However, some asbestos-exposed HM escape cell death, accumulate DNA damage, and may become transformed. We previously demonstrated that, upon asbestos exposure, HM and reactive macrophages releases the high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein that becomes detectable in the tissues near asbestos deposits where HMGB1 triggers chronic inflammation. HMGB1 is also detectable in the sera of asbestos-exposed individuals and mice. Searching for additional biomarkers, we found higher levels of the autophagy marker ATG5 in sera from asbestos-exposed individuals compared to unexposed controls. As we investigated the mechanisms underlying this finding, we discovered that the release of HMGB1 upon asbestos exposure promoted autophagy, allowing a higher fraction of HM to survive asbestos exposure. HMGB1 silencing inhibited autophagy and increased asbestos-induced HM death, thereby decreasing asbestos-induced HM transformation. We demonstrate that autophagy was induced by the cytoplasmic and extracellular fractions of HMGB1 via the engagement of the RAGE receptor and Beclin 1 pathway, while nuclear HMGB1 did not participate in this process. We validated our findings in a novel unique mesothelial conditional HMGB1-knockout (HMGB1-cKO) mouse model. Compared to HMGB1 wild-type mice, mesothelial cells from HMGB1-cKO mice showed significantly reduced autophagy and increased cell death. Autophagy inhibitors chloroquine and desmethylclomipramine increased cell death and reduced asbestos-driven foci formation. In summary, HMGB1 released upon asbestos exposure induces autophagy, promoting HM survival and malignant transformation.","Xue, Jiaming; Patergnani, Simone; Giorgi, Carlotta; Suarez, Joelle; Goto, Keisuke; Bononi, Angela; Tanji, Mika; Novelli, Flavia; Pastorino, Sandra; Xu, Ronghui; Caroccia, Natascia; Dogan, A Umran; Pass, Harvey I; Tognon, Mauro; Pinton, Paolo; Gaudino, Giovanni; Mak, Tak W; Carbone, Michele; Yang, Haining",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,678,5

A survey was conducted among the general public in Iran aimed at investigating psychobehavioural issues related to the COVID-19 outbreak, namely: 1) barriers to preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 infection; 2) negative emotions toward SARS-CoV-2 infection; and 3) anxiety levels among the general public in Iran. A cross-sectional, web-based survey using an online questionnaire was carried out between 16 March and 1 April 2020. The six-item version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) was used to assess anxiety levels. A total of 1,789 complete responses were received. Nearly 60% reported having difficulty in wearing a face mask to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mean and standard deviation (SD) for the total prevention barrier score was 35.8 (SD ± 7.1; range 18 to 68) out of a possible score of 72.

Negative emotions such as fear (74.6%), followed by depression (43.4%) and stigma (23.0%) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported. Respondents who perceived their health as poor/fair (OR = 2.19; 95% CI 1.57 to 3.04) reported a higher likelihood of having higher negative emotions. Findings on anxiety level revealed 68.0% (95% CI 65.8 to 70.1) reported moderate to severe anxiety.

However, the relevance of this parameter in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) remains controversial, given the inconsistencies in its ability to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) and oncological outcomes. Hence, further assessment of the utility of surgical margins for prostate cancer prognosis is required to predict these outcomes more accurately. Over the last decade, studies have used the Gleason score (GS) of positive margins to predict outcomes. Herein, the authors aim to conduct a systematic review investigating the role of GS of PSM after radical prostatectomy in predicting BCR and oncological outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will perform a search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS and COCHRANE databases. The review will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We will screen titles and abstracts to select articles appropriate for full-text review. Studies discussing GS of PSM after RP will be included. Given the change in reporting of GS, only articles from 2005 to 2019 will be included. The quality of the studies chosen will be assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa tool for non-randomised and Cochrane risk of bias for randomised control studies. We will adopt the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation framework to comment on quality of cumulative evidence. The primary outcome measure will be time to BCR. Secondary outcome measures include secondary treatment, disease-specific survival, disease progression-free and overall mortality at follow-up period. We aim to perform a meta-analysis if the level of heterogeneity is acceptable (I2 <50%). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The review does not require ethics approval as it is a review of published literature. The findings of the review will be submitted for peer-reviewed publications and presented at scientific meetings.

Objective To assess the effect of antimicrobial therapy on clinical outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants Pragmatic, randomized, unblinded clinical trial conducted across 35 US sites. A total of 513 patients older than 40 years were randomized from August 2017 to June 2019 (final follow-up was January 2020). Interventions Patients were randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to receive antimicrobials (n = 254) or usual care alone (n = 259). Antimicrobials included co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg twice daily plus folic acid 5 mg daily, n = 128) or doxycycline (100 mg once daily if body weight <50 kg or 100 mg twice daily if ≥50 kg, n = 126). No placebo was administered in the usual care alone group. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was time to first nonelective respiratory hospitalization or all-cause mortality. Results Among the 513 patients who were randomized (mean age, 71 years; 23.6% women), all (100%) were included in the analysis. The study was terminated for futility on December 18, 2019. After a mean follow-up time of 13.1 months (median, 12.7 months), a total of 108 primary end point events occurred: 52 events (20.4 events per 100 patient-years [95% CI, 14.8-25.9]) in the usual care plus antimicrobial therapy group and 56 events (18.4 events per 100 patient-years [95% CI, 13.2-23.6]) in the usual care group, with no significant difference between groups (adjusted HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.71-1.53; P = .83]. There was no statistically significant interaction between the effect of the prespecified antimicrobial agent (co-trimoxazole vs doxycycline) on the primary end point (adjusted HR, 1.15 [95% CI 0.68-1.95] in the co-trimoxazole group vs 0.82 [95% CI, 0.46-1.47] in the doxycycline group; P = .66). Serious adverse events occurring at 5% or greater among those treated with usual care plus antimicrobials vs usual care alone included respiratory events (16.5% vs 10.0%) and infections (2.8% vs 6.6%); adverse events of special interest included diarrhea (10.2% vs 3.1%) and rash (6.7% vs 0%). Conclusions and Relevance Among adults with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the addition of co-trimoxazole or doxycycline to usual care, compared with usual care alone, did not significantly improve time to nonelective respiratory hospitalization or death. These findings do not support treatment with these antibiotics for the underlying disease.

The virus, SARS-CoV-2 can cause a range of symptoms ranging from mild through fulminant respiratory failure. Approximately 25% of hospitalized patients require admission to the intensive care unit, with the majority of those requiring mechanical ventilation. High density consolidations in the bronchial tree and in the pulmonary parenchyma have been described in the advanced phase of the disease. We noted a subset of patients who had a sudden, significant increase in peak airway, plateau and peak inspiratory pressures. Partial or complete ETT occlusion was noted to be the culprit in the majority of these patients. METHODS With institutional IRB approval, we examined a subset of our mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. All of the patients were admitted to one of our COVID-19 ICUs. Each was staffed by a board certified intensivist. During multidisciplinary rounds, all arterial blood gas (ABG) results, ventilator settings and ventilator measurements are discussed and addressed. ARDSNet Protocols are employed. In patients with confirmed acute occlusion of the endotracheal tube (ETT), acute elevation in peak airway and peak inspiratory pressures are noted in conjunction with desaturation. Data was collected retrospectively and demographics, ventilatory settings and ABG results were recorded. RESULTS Our team has observed impeded ventilation in intubated patients who are several days into the critical course. Pathologic evaluation of the removed endotracheal tube contents from one of our patients demonstrated a specimen consistent with sloughed tracheobronchial tissues and inflammatory cells in a background of dense mucin. Of 110 patients admitted to our adult COVID-19 ICUs, 28 patients required urgent exchange of their ETT. CONCLUSION Caregivers need to be aware of this pathological finding, recognize, and to treat this aspect of the COVID-19 critical illness course, which is becoming more prevalent.","Rubano, Jerry A; Jasinski, Patrick T; Rutigliano, Daniel N; Tassiopoulos, Apostolos K; Davis, James E; Beg, Tazeen; Poovathoor, Shaji; Bergese, Sergio D; Ahmad, Sahar; Jawa, Randeep S; Vosswinkel, James A; Talamini, Mark A",Annals of surgery,678,26

A wide variety of liver function test abnormalities and few cases of severe liver failure have been reported. No data on the hepatic phenotype from Europe are available at current. METHODS We report a case series of 44 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Germany. RESULTS At the time of admission, aspartate aminotransferase greater than the upper limit of normal was present in 70%, while alanine aminotransferase was elevated in 15.8%. Markers of cholestatic liver injury were altered only in a minority of patients. During hospitalization, 31% and 22% experienced increasing aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, respectively, when transaminases were normal at admission. Severe liver injury defined by 3×> upper limit of normal was observed in 9.1% over a mean time of 10.5 days. Importantly, patients exhibited cytotoxicity including lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine kinase elevations, but no signs of relevant liver function impairment. CONCLUSION In summary, in a case series of hospitalized patients in Germany, cytotoxicity in the absence of severe liver dysfunction at admission and only few cases suggestive of severe liver injury during hospital were observed.","Schattenberg, Jörn M; Labenz, Christian; Wörns, Marcus-Alexander; Menge, Philipp; Weinmann, Arndt; Galle, Peter R; Sprinzl, Martin F",United European gastroenterology journal,678,1

Objective The aims of this review were to 1) determine the effects of dietary intake/behaviors on endogenous oxytocin and 2) examine the effect of exogenous oxytocin on dietary intake/behaviors. Data sources Published studies up to December 2016 were identified through searches of 5 electronic databases. Data extraction Eligible studies included those in adults that included a measure related to an individual's diet and a measure of oxytocin and the relationship between the 2 outcomes. Results Twenty-six studies (n = 912 participants; 77% female) were included. The most common dietary outcomes assessed were alcohol, caffeine, calcium, sodium, fat, and calorie intake. It was found that endogenous oxytocin (n = 13) in nonclinical samples did not change significantly (P > 0.05) through altered diet or behaviors (neutral effect); in contrast, significant (P < 0.05) differences (increases and decreases) were identified in clinical samples. Exogenous oxytocin studies (n = 13) found reduced indices of food intake (positive effect) in clinical and nonclinical samples. Conclusions Overall, few studies included comprehensive investigation of dietary intakes through the use of validated assessment tools. Dietary intake and behaviors appear to have some influence on oxytocin, with more pronounced effects found with exogenously administered oxytocin.","Skinner, Janelle A; Garg, Manohar L; Dayas, Christopher V; Fenton, Sasha; Burrows, Tracy L",Nutrition reviews,678,1

The question we address in this paper is how coarse the resolution of the spatial data can be for a model to be a useful tool for informing control policies. We examine this problem using the specific case of foot-and-mouth disease spreading between farms using the formulation developed during the 2001 epidemic in the United Kingdom. We show that, if our model is carefully parameterized to match epidemic behavior, then using aggregate county-scale data from the United States is sufficient to closely determine optimal control measures (specifically ring culling). This result also holds when the approach is extended to theoretical distributions of farms where the spatial clustering can be manipulated to extremes. We have therefore shown that, although spatial structure can be critically important in allowing us to predict the emergent population-scale behavior from a knowledge of the individual-level dynamics, for this specific applied question, such structure is mostly subsumed in the parameterization allowing us to make policy predictions in the absence of high-quality spatial information. We believe that this approach will be of considerable benefit across a range of disciplines where data are only available at intermediate spatial scales.","Tildesley, Michael J; House, Thomas A; Bruhn, Mark C; Curry, Ross J; O'Neil, Maggie; Allpress, Justine L E; Smith, Gary; Keeling, Matt J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,678,16

This was proceeded by several decades in which such advances were very scarce, or entirely absent, but several novel adjuvants have now been included in licensed products, including in the US. These advances have relied upon several key technological insights that have emerged in this time period, which have finally allowed an in depth understanding of how adjuvants work. These advances include developments in systems biology approaches which allow the hypotheses first advanced in pre-clinical studies to be critically evaluated in human studies. This review highlights these recent advances, both in relation to the adjuvants themselves, but also the technologies that have enabled their successes. Moreover, we critically appraise what will come next, both in terms of new adjuvant molecules, and the technologies needed to allow them to succeed. We confidently predict that additional adjuvants will emerge in the coming years that will reach approval in licensed products, but that the components might differ significantly from those which are currently used. Gradually, the natural products that were originally used to build adjuvants, since they were readily available at the time of initial development, will come to be replaced by synthetic or biosynthetic materials, with more appealing attributes, including more reliable and robust supply, along with reduced heterogeneity. The recent advance in vaccine adjuvants is timely, given the need to create novel vaccines to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although, we must ensure that the rigorous safety evaluations that allowed the current adjuvants to advance are not 'short-changed' in the push for new vaccines to meet the global challenge as quickly as possible, we must not jeopardize what we have achieved, by pushing less established technologies too quickly, if the data does not fully support it.","O'Hagan, Derek T; Lodaya, Rushit N; Lofano, Giuseppe",Seminars in immunology,678,1

The potential for large numbers of injured from either a man-made or natural disaster has resulted in the development of surge capacity plans and attempts to predict how many HCWs will be available to respond. Since 1991 (with the majority of the research published in 2002 and later), researchers have been conducting studies to learn about the willingness, ability, and intentions of HCWs to respond to disasters. Potential and real barriers to disaster response are being explored as well. This chapter focuses on research authored or coauthored by nurses. Nurse-authored research is just a portion of the growing body of knowledge in this area; however, the findings are consistent with other published works. HCWs are more likely to be willing and able to respond to natural disasters and less likely to be willing and able during infectious outbreaks or incidents with potential exposure to harmful agents (biological, chemical, nuclear, or radiological). HCW concerns include safety of self and family, availability of protective equipment, medicines and vaccines, and caretaking responsibilities (children, elders, and pets).","Couig, Mary Pat",Annual review of nursing research,678,19

This is because a wide spectrum of pathological impairments emerge in the later part of the human life course which sharply increase mortality and reduce quality of life. Dysfunction of the immune system with advancing age is of crucial importance to the development of disability in later life and finally death. Understanding immune ageing, immunosenescence, has long been recognised as an essential prerequisite for the delivery of effective interventions which will improve late life health. Ten years ago, the ImAginE consortium undertook a broad ranging series of projects which added significantly to our understanding of how fundamental ageing mechanisms drove immune decline. In the decade which followed, abundant evidence has accumulated from nonhuman model systems that ageing results from the progressive operation of a relatively few common processes which act across the major organ systems. These advances in fundamental understanding both allow better clarification of the potential cross-system dysregulation that occurs in ageing and open new avenues for intervention. Over the course of a 2-day workshop, the original ImAginE participants have considered these issues and present some suggestions for current priority areas in immunosenescence.","Faragher, Richard; Frasca, Daniela; Remarque, Edmond; Pawelec, Graham",Age,678,19

We systematically reviewed the literature that reported the association between the free provision of tangible goods and health outcomes. METHODS A search was performed for relevant literature in all languages from 1995-May 2017. Eligible studies were observational and experimental which had at least one tangible item provided for free and had at least one quantitative measure of health. Studies were excluded if the intervention was primarily a service and the free good was relatively unimportant; if the good was a medication; or if the data in a study was duplicated in another study. Covidence screening software was used to manage articles for two levels of screening. Data was extracted using an adaption of the Cochrane data collection template. Health outcomes, those that affect the quality or duration of life, are the outcomes of interest. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017069463). FINDINGS The initial search identified 3370 articles and 59 were included in the final set with a range of 20 to 252 246 participants. The risk of bias assessment revealed that overall, the studies were of medium to high quality.

Successful management of portal sepsis involves early identification of the condition, intensive resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics and a laparotomy for possible bowel ischaemia. In this report, we discuss the case of a patient with pneumatosis intestinalis and HPVG after an elective laparoscopic right hemicolectomy. After an initial slow recovery, on postoperative day seven, the patient had profuse diarrhoea and confusion, and was hyponatraemic. A CT scan revealed pneumatosis intestinalis and HPVG. A laparotomy showed no obvious cause for HPVG and there was no ischaemic bowel. She was managed with intensive care, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics and total-parenteral nutrition. She has made a good recovery. This case highlights the presenting features, differential diagnoses, and management of pneumatosis intestinalis and HPVG.","Castren, Edit Elisa; Hakeem, Abdul R; Mahmood, Nabil S; Aryal, Kamal",BMJ case reports,678,1

Five randomized control trials have firmly established the role of endovascular thrombectomy for ischemic strokes due to large vessel occlusion. The randomized trial of intraarterial treatment for acute ischemic stroke (MR CLEAN) (Berkhemer et al. NEJM 2015;372:11-20) was the first of a series on the topic. There was a total of 5 randomized controlled trials published showing benefit in terms of functional outcomes at 90days for mechanical thrombectomy including the Endovascular Therapy for Ischemic stroke with perfusion-imaging selection (EXTEND IA) (Campbell et al.

The only marketed analogue, vaborbactam, principally targets KPC carbapenemases, but taniborbactam (VNRX-5133, Venatorx) has a broader spectrum. METHODS MICs of cefepime and meropenem were determined combined with taniborbactam or avibactam for carbapenem-resistant UK isolates. β-Lactamase genes and porin alterations were sought by PCR or sequencing. RESULTS Taniborbactam potentiated partner β-lactams against: (i) Enterobacterales with KPC, other class A, OXA-48-like, VIM and NDM (not IMP) carbapenemases; and (ii) Enterobacterales inferred to have combinations of ESBL or AmpC activity and impermeability. Potentiation of cefepime (the partner for clinical development) by taniborbactam was slightly weaker than by avibactam for Enterobacterales with KPC or OXA-48-like carbapenemases, but MICs of cefepime/taniborbactam were similar to those of ceftazidime/avibactam, and the spectrum was wider. MICs of cefepime/taniborbactam nonetheless remained >8 + 4 mg/L for 22%-32% of NDM-producing Enterobacterales. Correlates of raised cefepime/taniborbactam MICs among these NDM Enterobacterales were a cefepime MIC >128 mg/L, particular STs and, for Escherichia coli only: (i) the particular blaNDM variant (even though published data suggest all variants are inhibited similarly); (ii) inserts in PBP3; and (iii) raised aztreonam/avibactam MICs. Little or no potentiation of cefepime or meropenem was seen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii with MBLs, probably reflecting slower uptake or stronger efflux. Potentiation of cefepime was seen for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, which have both chromosomal ESBLs and MBLs. CONCLUSIONS Taniborbactam broadly reversed cefepime or meropenem non-susceptibility in Enterobacterales and, less reliably, in non-fermenters.","Mushtaq, Shazad; Vickers, Anna; Doumith, Michel; Ellington, Matthew J; Woodford, Neil; Livermore, David M",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,678,1

Objective To compare the rate of ischemic stroke between patients with COVID-19 and patients with influenza, a respiratory viral illness previously associated with stroke. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study was conducted at 2 academic hospitals in New York City, New York, and included adult patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with COVID-19 from March 4, 2020, through May 2, 2020. The comparison cohort included adults with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with influenza A/B from January 1, 2016, through May 31, 2018 (spanning moderate and severe influenza seasons). Exposures COVID-19 infection confirmed by evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the nasopharynx by polymerase chain reaction and laboratory-confirmed influenza A/B. Main Outcomes and Measures A panel of neurologists adjudicated the primary outcome of acute ischemic stroke and its clinical characteristics, mechanisms, and outcomes. We used logistic regression to compare the proportion of patients with COVID-19 with ischemic stroke vs the proportion among patients with influenza. Results Among 1916 patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with COVID-19, 31 (1.6%; 95% CI, 1.1%-2.3%) had an acute ischemic stroke. The median age of patients with stroke was 69 years (interquartile range, 66-78 years); 18 (58%) were men. Stroke was the reason for hospital presentation in 8 cases (26%). In comparison, 3 of 1486 patients with influenza (0.2%; 95% CI, 0.0%-0.6%) had an acute ischemic stroke. After adjustment for age, sex, and race, the likelihood of stroke was higher with COVID-19 infection than with influenza infection (odds ratio, 7.6; 95% CI, 2.3-25.2). The association persisted across sensitivity analyses adjusting for vascular risk factors, viral symptomatology, and intensive care unit admission. Conclusions and Relevance In this retrospective cohort study from 2 New York City academic hospitals, approximately 1.6% of adults with COVID-19 who visited the emergency department or were hospitalized experienced ischemic stroke, a higher rate of stroke compared with a cohort of patients with influenza. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings and to investigate possible thrombotic mechanisms associated with COVID-19.","Merkler, Alexander E; Parikh, Neal S; Mir, Saad; Gupta, Ajay; Kamel, Hooman; Lin, Eaton; Lantos, Joshua; Schenck, Edward J; Goyal, Parag; Bruce, Samuel S; Kahan, Joshua; Lansdale, Kelsey N; LeMoss, Natalie M; Murthy, Santosh B; Stieg, Philip E; Fink, Matthew E; Iadecola, Costantino; Segal, Alan Z; Cusick, Marika; Campion, Thomas R; Diaz, Ivan; Zhang, Cenai; Navi, Babak B",JAMA neurology,678,1

The mechanism by which DNAJC14 stoichiometrically participates in flavivirus replication complex (RC) formation is unknown; both reduced and elevated levels result in replication inhibition. Using yellow fever virus (YFV), we demonstrate that DNAJC14 redistributes and clusters with YFV nonstructural proteins via a transmembrane domain and a newly identified membrane-binding domain (MBD), which both mediate targeting to detergent-resistant membranes. Furthermore, the RC and DNAJC14 reside as part of a protein interaction network that remains after 1% Triton solubilization. Mutagenesis studies demonstrate that entry into this protein interaction network requires the DNAJC14 C-terminal self-interaction domain. Fusion of the DNAJC14 MBD and self-interaction domain with another Hsp40 family protein is sufficient to confer YFV-inhibitory activity. Our findings support a novel model of DNAJC14 action that includes specific membrane targeting of both DNAJC14 and YFV replication proteins, the formation of protein interactions, and a microdomain-specific chaperone event leading to RC formation. This process alters the properties of the RC membrane and results in the formation of a protein scaffold that maintains the RC.","Yi, Zhigang; Yuan, Zhenghong; Rice, Charles M; MacDonald, Margaret R",Journal of virology,678,26

METHODS A cross sectional observational analytic study among ophthalmologists practicing in different hospitals in Cairo metropolitan area. The data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire covering general measures taken during practice. RESULTS The questionnaire was sent to 250 ophthalmologists with 82% response. Most of the participants were concerned about the economic impact of the pandemic, as there is 60-80% reduction in the flow of patients with consequent 80-100% reduction in the surgical cases. Most of the participants have access to protective personal equipments, and safety protocols are followed, especially by the older ophthalmologists. So, surgeons are willing to perform elective surgeries taking strict safety protocols (70.8%, 42.6%, 18.8% for the refractive surgeons, corneal surgeons, retinal surgeons respectively, p=0.00). Furthermore, 63.9% of the participants,especially the young ophthalmologists, are willing to see COVID-19 patients and operate on them if needed. CONCLUSION COVID-19 pandemic could go on for months or even years with a significant impact on the ophthalmology practice. Trying to keep the balance between safety and economic burdens, the majority of ophthalmologists are willing to see elective patients and operate on an urgent COVID-19 patient, with adherence to the safety protocols.","Abdullatif, Abdussalam Mohsen; Makled, Hebatalla Samir; Hamza, Mostafa; Macky, Tamer A; El-Saied, Heba Magdy Ahmed",Ophthalmologica.

SJL/J mice, which are highly resistant to MHV-A59, were previously shown to lack detectable levels of receptor by using either solid-phase virus receptor assays or binding of a monoclonal anti-receptor antibody (MAb) which blocks infection of MHV-susceptible mouse cells. This MAb was used for affinity purification of the receptor glycoprotein from livers of MHV-susceptible Swiss Webster mice. The MHV receptor and an antigenically related protein of 48 to 58 kDa were copurified and then separated by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The first 15 amino acids of the receptor were sequenced, and a synthetic peptide of this amino acid sequence was prepared. Rabbit antiserum made against this peptide bound to the MHV receptor glycoprotein and the 48- to 58-kDa protein from livers of MHV-susceptible BALB/c mice and Swiss Webster mice and from the intestinal brush border of BALB/c mice. In immunoblots of intestinal brush border and hepatocyte membranes of MHV-resistant SJL/J mice, the antibody against the amino terminus of the receptor identified proteins that are 5 to 10 kDa smaller than the MHV receptor and the 48- to 58-kDa related protein from Swiss Webster or BALB/c mice. Thus, SJL/J mice express a protein which shares some sequence homology with the MHV receptor but which lacks virus-binding activity and is not recognized by the blocking anti-receptor MAb. These results suggest that resistance of SJL/J mice to MHV-A59 may be due to absence or mutation of the virus-binding domain in the nonfunctional receptor homolog in SJL/J mice.","Williams, R K; Jiang, G S; Snyder, S W; Frana, M F; Holmes, K V",Journal of virology,678,1

Nowhere is this more critical than for the brain, where various passive and active mechanisms maintain a state of immune privilege that can limit high magnitude immune responses. Nevertheless, it is now clear that immune responses are induced to antigens in the brain, including those expressed by cerebral malignancies. We discuss hypotheses of how this can occur, although details such as which antigen presenting cells are involved remain to be clarified. Antitumor responses induced spontaneously are insufficient to eradicate malignant astrocytomas; many studies suggest that this can be explained by a combination of low level immune response induction and tumor mediated immunosuppression. A clinical objective currently pursued is to use immunotherapy to ameliorate antitumour immunity. This will necessitate a high level immune response to ensure sufficient effector cells reach the tumor bed, focused cytotoxicity to eradicate malignant cells with little collateral damage to critical normal cells, and minimal inflammation. To achieve these aims, priority should be given to identifying more target antigens in astrocytoma and defining those cells present in the brain parenchyma that are essential to maintain antitumour effector function without exacerbating inflammation. If we are armed with better understanding of immune interactions with brain tumor cells, we can realistically envisage that immunotherapy will one day offer hope to patients with currently untreatable neoplastic diseases of the CNS.","Walker, Paul R; Calzascia, Thomas; de Tribolet, Nicolas; Dietrich, Pierre Yves",Brain research.

However, the molecular mechanisms underneath remain poorly understood. In this study, 144 COVID-19 patients were enrolled to monitor the clinical and laboratory parameters over 3 weeks. Serum LDH was shown elevated in the COVID-19 patients on admission and declined throughout disease course, and its ability to classify patient severity outperformed other biochemical indicators. A threshold of 247 U/L serum LDH on admission was determined for severity prognosis. Next, we classified a subset of 14 patients into high- and low-risk groups based on serum LDH expression and compared their quantitative serum proteomic and metabolomic differences. The results showed that COVID-19 patients with high serum LDH exhibited differentially expressed blood coagulation and immune responses including acute inflammatory responses, platelet degranulation, complement cascade, as well as multiple different metabolic responses including lipid metabolism, protein ubiquitination and pyruvate fermentation. Specifically, activation of hypoxia responses was highlighted in patients with high LDH expressions. Taken together, our data showed that serum LDH levels are associated with COVID-19 severity, and that elevated serum LDH might be consequences of hypoxia and tissue injuries induced by inflammation.","Yan, Haixi; Liang, Xiao; Du, Juping; He, Zebao; Wang, Yu; Lyu, Mengge; Yue, Liang; Zhang, Fangfei; Xue, Zhangzhi; Xu, Luang; Ruan, Guan; Li, Jun; Zhu, Hongguo; Xu, Jiaqin; Chen, Shiyong; Zhang, Chao; Lv, Dongqing; Lin, Zongmei; Shen, Bo; Zhu, Yi; Qian, Biyun; Chen, Haixiao; Guo, Tiannan",Proteomics,678,33

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia in critically ill patients. DATA SOURCE: We performed a systematic search of peer-reviewed publications in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library up to August 15(th), 2020. Preprints and reports were also included if they met the inclusion criteria. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Full-text prospective, retrospective or registry-based publications describing outcomes in patients admitted to the ICU for COVID-19, using a validated test. PARTICIPANTS: Critically ill patients admitted in the ICU with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: From 32 articles included, a total of 69,093 patients were admitted to the ICU and were evaluated. Most patients admitted to the ICU were male (76,165/128,168 (59%); 26 studies) and the mean patient age was 56 (95% CI 48.5 – 59.8) years-old. Studies described high ICU mortality (21,145/65,383; 32.3%; 15 studies). The median length of ICU stay was 9.0 (95% CI 6.5 – 11.2) days, described in 5 studies. More than half of patients admitted to the ICU required mechanical ventilation (31,213/53,465; 58%; 23 studies) and among them mortality was very high (27,972/47,632, 59%, 6 studies). The duration of mechanical ventilation was 8.4 (95% CI 1.6 – 13.7) days. The main interventions described were the use of non-invasive ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal replacement therapy and vasopressors. CONCLUSION: This systematic review including approximately 69,000 ICU patients demonstrates that COVID-19 infection in critically ill patients is associated with high need for life-sustaining interventions, high mortality and prolonged length of ICU stay.","Serafim, Rodrigo B.; Póvoa, Pedro; Souza-Dantas, Vicente; Kalil, André C.; Salluh, Jorge I.F.",Clin Microbiol Infect,678,33

Serologic assays detect antibodies that react against viral proteins, suggesting prior infection and correlative of an increased likelihood of immunity to future infection. As these assays are focused on the human immune response to a pathogen, and humans are variable, there are a number of important engineering steps to optimize assay performance, from sample collection, to assay execution and data analysis.
