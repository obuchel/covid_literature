The UK centralized commissioning of public health care has delivered a coherent high-quality national adult ECMO service and defined the key factors in the designation as adult ECMO centre. This strategy seems adequate to provide for the needs of the population and avoid the danger of occasional practice by teams who do not undertake ECMO regularly.,"Peek, G. J.",Reanimation,545,1

In addition to its original name, given before its relationship to viral hepatitis became known, the antigen has also been given the designations, including Au(1) , SH antigen, Au/SH antigen, hepatitis antigen, and hepatitis-associated antigen (HAA). The synthesis of Au antigen, and its appearance in the serum, is specifically associated with infection by the causal agent of the SH type of viral hepatitis. The chapter discusses properties of the antigen, and of the particles which carry the Au specificity. It also discusses various serological techniques for Au antigen, such as two-dimensional double immunodiffusion (ID), complement fixation (CF), immunofluorescence (IF), reversed passive hemagglutination (RPHA) of antibody-coated red cells, immune electron microscopy (IEM), immunoelectroosmophoresis (IEOP), and radioimmunoassay (RIA).","Bouvier, George L.

The complete nucleotide sequence of the “P≓ gene has been obtained and is found to contain two open reading frames, neither of which is large enough to encode the P protein. We have shown that the P and V proteins are translated from two mRNAs that differ by the presence of two nontemplated G residues in the P mRNA. These two additional nucleotides convert the two open reading frames to one of 392 amino acids. The P and V proteins are amino coterminal and have 164 amino acids in common. The unique C terminus of V consists of a cysteine-rich region that resembles a cysteine-rich metal binding domain. An open reading frame that contains this cysteine-rich region exists in all other paramyxovirus “P≓ gene sequences examined, which suggests that it may have important biological significance.","Thomas, Sheila M.; Lamb, Robert A.; Paterson, Reay G.",Cell,545,4

This short note recounts past data indicating that (i) neutrophils home along an IL-8 gradient, (ii) in ARDS, massive neutrophil accumulation and degranulation in and along bronchoalveolar spaces contributes to damage and hypoxia, (iii) large increases in IL-8 are one of the chemotaxic signals drawing neutrophils to the ARDS lung, and (iv) old data from dermatology and glioblastoma research showed that the old drug against Hansen’s disease, dapsone, inhibits neutrophils’ chemotaxis to IL-8. Therefore dapsone might lower neutrophils’ contributions to ARDS lung pathology. Dapsone can create methemoglobinemia that although rarely problematic it would be particularly undesirable in ARDS. The common antacid drug cimetidine lowers risk of dapsone related methemoglobinemia and should be given concomitantly.","Kast, R. E.",Exp Lung Res,545,4

There are to the complexity of the immune response, there are many factors that determine the efficacy of DC therapy. These include accurate administration of DCs in the target tissue site without unwanted cell dispersion/backflow, sufficient numbers of tumor antigen-primed DCs homing to lymph nodes (LNs), and proper timing of immunoadjuvant administration. To address these uncertainties, proton ((1)H) and fluorine ((19)F) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tracking of ex vivo pre-labeled DCs can now be used to non-invasively determine the accuracy of therapeutic DC injection, initial DC dispersion, systemic DC distribution, and DC migration to and within LNs. Magnetovaccination is an alternative approach that tracks in vivo labeled DCs that simultaneously capture tumor antigen and MR contrast agent in situ, enabling an accurate quantification of antigen presentation to T cells in LNs. The ultimate clinical premise of MRI DC tracking would be to use changes in LN MRI signal as an early imaging biomarker to predict the efficacy of tumor vaccination and anti-tumor response long before treatment outcome becomes apparent, which may aid clinicians with interim treatment management.","Bulte, Jeff W.

We attempt to answer this question with a large-scale reproducibility study of BM25, considering eight variants. Experiments on three newswire collections show that there are no significant effectiveness differences between them, including Lucene’s often maligned approximation of document length. As an added benefit, our empirical approach takes advantage of databases for rapid IR prototyping, which validates both the feasibility and methodological advantages claimed in previous work.","Kamphuis, Chris; de Vries, Arjen P.; Boytsov, Leonid; Lin, Jimmy",Advances in Information Retrieval,545,4

It oligomerizes to form a closed capsule, inside which the genomic RNA is securely stored thus providing the SARS-CoV genome with its first line of defense from the harsh conditions of the host environment and aiding in replication and propagation of the virus. In addition to this function, several reports have suggested that the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein modulates various host cellular processes, so as to make the internal milieu of the host more conducive for survival of the virus. This article will analyze and discuss the available literature regarding these different properties of the nucleocapsid protein.

Videoconferencing is being used to maintain social ties, run business meetings—and to uphold responsible government. On April 28, 2020, Members of the House of Commons sat virtually using Zoom. The virtual sitting was the first of what will become a stand-in for regular proceedings, allowing the Members to fulfill some of their parliamentary duties while complying with physical distancing (see Malloy, 2020). As the legislative and executive branches look to digital technology to allow the business of government to continue, what about the judicial branch of Canada's government? Courts are an essential service. This is best articulated by the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia: “The fact is, the Courts cannot close. As the third branch of government, an independent judiciary is vital for our Canadian democracy to function. It is never more important than in times of crisis” (Wood, 2020).

Organizational factors may play a role on adherence to LTVV. The present study aimed to identify organizational factors with an independent association with adherence to LTVV. METHODS: Secondary analysis of the database of a multicenter two-phase study (prospective cohort followed by a cluster-randomized trial) performed in 118 Brazilian intensive care units. Patients under mechanical ventilation at day 2 were included. LTVV was defined as a V(T) ≤ 8 ml/kg PBW on the second day of ventilation. Data on the type and number of beds of the hospital, teaching status, nursing, respiratory therapists and physician staffing, use of structured checklist, and presence of protocols were tested. A multivariable mixed-effect model was used to assess the association between organizational factors and adherence to LTVV. RESULTS: The study included 5719 patients; 3340 (58%) patients received LTVV. A greater number of hospital beds (absolute difference 7.43% [95% confidence interval 0.61–14.24%]; p = 0.038), use of structured checklist during multidisciplinary rounds (5.10% [0.55–9.81%]; p = 0.030), and presence of at least one nurse per 10 patients during all shifts (17.24% [0.85–33.60%]; p = 0.045) were the only three factors that had an independent association with adherence to LTVV. CONCLUSIONS: Number of hospital beds, use of a structured checklist during multidisciplinary rounds, and nurse staffing are organizational factors associated with adherence to LTVV. These findings shed light on organizational factors that may improve ventilation in critically ill patients.","Midega, Thais Dias; Bozza, Fernando A.; Machado, Flávia Ribeiro; Guimarães, Helio Penna; Salluh, Jorge I.; Nassar, Antonio Paulo; Normílio-Silva, Karina; Schultz, Marcus J.; Cavalcanti, Alexandre Biasi; Serpa Neto, Ary",Ann Intensive Care,545,4

The use of electromagnetic interactions has enabled the development of more reliable local-regional hyperthermia (LRHT) techniques whole-body hyperthermia (WBH) techniques. Contrary to the relatively simple physical-physiological concepts behind hyperthermia, its development was not steady, and it has gone through periods of failures and renewals with mixed views on the benefits of heating seen in the medical community over the decades. In this review we study in detail the various techniques currently available and describe challenges and trends of oncological hyperthermia from a new perspective. Our aim is to describe what we believe to be a new and effective approach to oncologic hyperthermia, and a change in the paradigm of dosing. Physiological limits restrict the application of WBH which has moved toward the mild temperature range, targeting immune support. LRHT does not have a temperature limit in the tumor (which can be burned out in extreme conditions) but a trend has started toward milder temperatures with immune-oriented goals, developing toward immune modulation, and especially toward tumor-specific immune reactions by which LRHT seeks to target the malignancy systemically. The emerging research of bystander and abscopal effects, in both laboratory investigations and clinical applications, has been intensified.

Because both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were higher in the ASV group, an EF ≤ 45% in combination with AHI 15/h, central apnoea-hyponoea index [CAHI/AHI] > 50% and central apnoea index [CAI] > 10/h were subsequently listed as contraindications for ASV. The intention of our study was to analyse the clinical relevance of this limitation. METHODS: Data were analysed retrospectively for patients treated with ASV who received follow-up echocardiography to identify contraindications for ASV. RESULTS: Echocardiography was conducted in 23 patients. The echocardiogram was normal in 10 cases, a left ventricular hypertrophy with normal EF was found in 8 patients, there was an EF 45–50% in 2 cases and a valvular aortic stenosis (grade II) with normal EF was found in 1 case. EF <45% was present in just 2 cases, and only 1 of these patients also had more than 50% central events in the diagnostic night. CONCLUSION: The population typically treated with ASV is entirely different from the study population in SERVE-HF, as nearly half of the patients treated with ASV showed a normal echocardiogram. Thus, the modified indication for ASV has little impact on the majority of treated patients. The current pathomechanistic hypothesis of central apnoea must be reviewed.","Stieglitz, Sven; Galetke, Wolfgang; Esquinas, Antonio",Somnologie (Berl),545,1

There is also an information crisis enabled by the political strategy of dissemination of disinformation that disqualifies scientific parameters and the role of the press. In this context, churches and Christian religious leaders who have risen to power in recent years play a fundamental role, which allows them to be analyzed from their performance as a public religion. By decreeing the closure of religious temples, as a preventive measure for the advance of the disease, evangelical-pentecostal churches insert into the public debate the defense of the essentiality of religious service as a fundamental dimension for society, conferring support and legitimacy to the action of the government. In this sense, this paper argues that the Brazilian scenario, when compared to other Latin American countries, is an outlier. Based on ethnographic research within online media and the religious media circuit, this paper maintains that, nationally, religion takes the lead in the political and information crisis. At the same time, this study affirms that, approaching other countries of the region, the churches reinvented mediatized religious practices, deriving from the social distancing and isolation, and offered new meanings and religious moralities around the health crisis.","Bandeira, Olívia; Carranza, Brenda",Int J Lat Am Relig,545,26

Using two superior strains, single and dual inoculation treatments in maize were applied in field experiment during the 2018 and 2019 seasons. Results indicated that B. subtilis and P. koreensis strains had shown the most qualitative and quantitative assays for siderophore production and antagonistic activities. In greenhouse, the most effective treatments on the pre- and post-emergence damping off as well as growth promotion of maize were T3 treatment (inoculated with B. subtilis), and T8 treatment (inoculated with P. koreensis).

In NHS Tayside, a dedicated Covid-19 Medicine for the Elderly (MFE) Team was formed to care for patients identified as frail and likely to benefit from comprehensive geriatric assessment. METHODS: All Covid-19 patients meeting frailty criteria1, cared for by the Covid-19 MFE Team were identified. Data on outcomes and clinical characteristics for all (140) patients admitted during the first pandemic wave (March–July 2020) was collected using electronic patient records and analysed. RESULTS: Patients were predominantly male (58.6%). Ages ranged from 65–99 years, with 43.6% aged ≥85 years. 82.1% had one or more of cough, fever and anosmia on admission fitting Covid-19 case definition 2. Lymphopenia was present in 92.1%. Of note, 26.5% of patients had a normal or unchanged chest x-ray report, with only 10.2% showing bilateral peripheral infiltrates. 28-day mortality was 37.1% with Covid-19 Disease listed as primary cause of death in 90.4%. CONCLUSION(S): Entering further “waves” of infection, it is vital that we understand the clinical presentation and course of Covid-19 disease in elderly patients. Our data highlights that any Covid-19 symptom, even in isolation, should raise suspicion of disease. Chest x-rays should not be used alone as a diagnostic tool. The presence of lymphopenia should raise suspicion of Covid-19 infection. In developing an understanding of how elderly patients with Covid-19 present, we can ensure early identification and initiation of appropriate infection control measures. REFERENCES: 1.

COVID-19 posed challenges in terms of analgesia choice for reductions and altered follow-up arrangements. This study aimed to assess variance from the care pathway. METHODOLOGY: We performed a retrospective case note analysis of all emergency presentations with acute traumatic anterior shoulder dislocations at the MTC in Bristol. We compared 01 Apr to 31 May in 2019 to the same period in 2020 to analyse the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of these injuries. Data parameters collated included examinations and imaging pre- and post-reduction, choice of analgesia, follow-up rates, referral to physiotherapy, and further imaging requested. RESULTS: We identified 32 patients in 2019, and 24 in 2020. Use of Entonox fell during the pandemic in favour of Penthrox. Use of conscious sedation (requiring full PPE) remained around 20%. Pre- and post-reduction orthogonal radiographs was near 100% in both cohorts. Referral to follow-up was 88% in 2019 but fell to 38% in 2020. Of those assessed in clinic during COVID-19, fewer were mobilised early or referred to outpatient physiotherapy compared to the previous year. CONCLUSIONS: The acute management of anterior shoulder dislocations during the early COVID-19 pandemic faced two main challenges: choice of suitable analgesia whilst minimising AGPs; and limiting access to ’face-to-face’ follow-up to minimise hospital attendances. A key concern was a significant decrease in patient follow-up, thus limiting the access to optimal aftercare such as physiotherapy and further imaging.","Donovan, Richard L; Abdelmalek, Amir; Crowther, Mark A A; Packham, Iain; Donovan, Richard",BJS Open,545,1

The variety of acute respiratory distress syndrome phenotypes implies personalization of those settings. To guide personalized positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume, physicians need to have an in-depth understanding of the physiologic effects and bedside methods to measure the extent of these effects. In the present article, a step-by-step physiologic approach to select personalized positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume at the bedside is described. DATA SOURCES: The present review is a critical reanalysis of the traditional and latest literature on the topic. STUDY SELECTION: Relevant clinical and physiologic studies on positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume setting were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: Reappraisal of the available physiologic and clinical data. DATA SYNTHESIS: Positive end-expiratory pressure is aimed at stabilizing alveolar recruitment, thus reducing the risk of volutrauma and atelectrauma. Bedside assessment of the potential for lung recruitment is a preliminary step to recognize patients who benefit from higher positive end-expiratory pressure level. In patients with higher potential for lung recruitment, positive end-expiratory pressure could be selected by physiology-based methods balancing recruitment and overdistension. In patients with lower potential for lung recruitment or in shock, positive end-expiratory pressure could be maintained in the 5–8 cm H(2)O range. Tidal volume induces alveolar recruitment and improves gas exchange. After setting personalized positive end-expiratory pressure, tidal volume could be based on lung inflation (collapsed lung size) respecting safety thresholds of static and dynamic lung stress. Positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume could be kept stable for some hours in order to allow early recognition of changes in the clinical course of acute respiratory distress syndrome but also frequently reassessed to avoid crossing of safety thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: The setting of personalized positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume based on sound physiologic bedside measures may represent an effective strategy for treating acute respiratory distress syndrome patients.","Mauri, Tommaso",Crit Care Explor,545,1

The brain, especially the hypothalamus, which secretes Neuropeptide Y (NPY), is speculated to regulate BAT activity. However, whether NPY is involved in BAT activity’s central regulation in humans remains unclear. Thus, it’s essential to explore the relationship between brain glucose metabolism and human BAT activity. METHODS: A controlled study with a large sample of healthy adults used Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to noninvasively investigate BAT’s activity and brain glucose metabolism in vivo. Eighty healthy adults with activated BAT according to the PET/CT scan volunteered to be the BAT positive group, while 80 healthy adults without activated BAT but with the same gender, similar age, and BMI, scanning on the same day, were recruited as the control (BAT negative). We use Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) to analyze the brain image data, Picture Archiving & Communication System (PACS), and PET/CT Viewer software to calculate the semi-quantitative values of brain glucose metabolism and BAT activity. ELISA tested the levels of fasting plasma NPY. The multiple linear regression models were used to analyze the correlation between brain glucose metabolism, the level of NPY, and the BAT activity in the BAT positive group. RESULTS: (1) Compared with controls, BAT positive group showed significant metabolic decreases mainly in the right Insula (BA13a, BA13b) and the right claustrum (uncorrected P <0.01, adjusted BMI). (2) The three brain regions’ semi-quantitative values in the BAT positive group were significantly lower than the negative group (all P values < 0.05). (3) After adjusting for age, gender, BMI, and outside temperature, there was a negative correlation between brain metabolic values and BAT activity (all P values < 0.05). However, after further adjusting for NPY level, there were no significant differences between the BA13b metabolic values and BAT activity (P>0.05), while the correlation between the BA13a metabolic values and BAT activity still was significant (P< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Regional brain glucose metabolism is closely related to healthy adults’ BAT activity, which may be mediated by NPY.","Zhang, Qiongyue; Miao, Qing; Yang, Yehong; Lu, Jiaying; Zhang, Huiwei; Feng, Yonghao; Wu, Wei; Zhu, Xiaoming; Xiang, Boni; Sun, Quanya; Guan, Yihui; Li, Yiming; Zuo, Chuantao; Ye, Hongying",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),545,17

A class of aggregation methods for fuzzy information is fuzzy distance aggregation operators in which distance values are argument variables. This class of aggregation operators permits us to consider an ideal alternative in the aggregation process. But these operators fall in dealing with situations among which distance values cannot be aggregated directly. Therefore, we proposed some distance induced fuzzy operators in which distance values are order-inducing variables so that we can also consider an ideal alternative but take other parameters, also including distance values, as argument variables in an aggregation process. We analyzed the concepts, properties, and generalized forms of proposed distance induced fuzzy operators in this paper. Moreover, aiming at multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM), three frameworks of MCGDM methods with the proposed distance induced fuzzy operators are constructed for three different MCGDM situations, respectively.

Hereto, multi-stakeholder consortia are currently designing several disease-specific translational research platforms to enable international health data sharing. Despite the recent adoption of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the procedures for how to govern responsible data sharing in such projects are not at all spelled out yet. In search of a first, basic outline of an ethical governance framework, we set out to explore relevant ethical principles and norms. METHODS We performed a systematic review of literature and ethical guidelines for principles and norms pertaining to data sharing for international health research. RESULTS We observed an abundance of principles and norms with considerable convergence at the aggregate level of four overarching themes: societal benefits and value; distribution of risks, benefits and burdens; respect for individuals and groups; and public trust and engagement. However, at the level of principles and norms we identified substantial variation in the phrasing and level of detail, the number and content of norms considered necessary to protect a principle, and the contextual approaches in which principles and norms are used. CONCLUSIONS While providing some helpful leads for further work on a coherent governance framework for data sharing, the current collection of principles and norms prompts important questions about how to streamline terminology regarding de-identification and how to harmonise the identified principles and norms into a coherent governance framework that promotes data sharing while securing public trust.","Kalkman, Shona; Mostert, Menno; Gerlinger, Christoph; van Delden, Johannes J M; van Thiel, Ghislaine J M W",BMC medical ethics,545,25

Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases. In this study, aiming to investigate these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database, we conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model: exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited. There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation. Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.","Sato, Kenichiro; Mano, Tatsuo; Iwata, Atsushi; Toda, Tatsushi",Bioscience trends,545,1

Doxorubicin (DOX) as a model drug was loaded into RBCs by the hypotonic dialysis method. A series of tests have been carried out to evaluate the RBCs-based DDS and these tasks include physicochemical properties, cellular uptake, targeting ability, and combination therapeutic efficiency. As a result, the DOX was successfully loaded into RBCs and the drug loading amount was 0.84 ± 0.09 mg/mL. There was no significant change of particle size after surface modification of RBCs. The RBCs-based DDS could target to the surface of cancer cells, which delivery DOX to the lesions efficiently and accurately. Meanwhile, due to the combined treatment effect, the RBCs-based DDS can effectively inhibit tumor growth. The RBCs-based DDS constructed in this research may have promising applications in cancer therapy due to their highly synergistic efficient therapy and to investigate its possibility for tumor therapy.","Wang, Chen; Huang, Jingru; Zhang, Yan; Jia, Hongxin; Chen, Binbin","Colloids and surfaces.

Psychological capital (PsyCap), a multidimensional construct that includes hope, optimism, resilience and self-efficacy, may serve as a resource for helping people more effectively cope with uncertainty resulting in lower levels of perceived stress. The authors hypothesize a negative relationship between PsyCap and perceived stress that is partially and differentially mediated by adaptive and maladaptive coping styles. The authors further hypothesize that work context (home vs workplace) will moderate the relationships between coping styles and perceived stress. Design/methodology/approach After receiving Institutional Review Board approval, data were collected during the first week of May 2020 using an online survey. The hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques, specifically Mplus 8. The authors validated their initial findings using PROCESS Model 14 with 5,000 boot-strapped samples and a 95% confidence interval. Findings The authors' results show that adaptive and maladaptive coping styles differentially mediate the effects of PsyCap on perceived stress with the indirect effects of PsyCap on perceived stress through maladaptive coping being stronger than the indirect effects through adaptive coping. The authors found support for the relationships in our hypothesized model. Practical implications The authors' findings suggest that health interventions aimed at increasing PsyCap may be an effective means of reducing maladaptive coping and perceived stress. Future research should continue to explore PsyCap as a potential means of shaping positive health behaviors. Originality/value This study makes a unique contribution to the literature by explaining how PsyCap operates through coping to affect perceptions of stress in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Maykrantz, S.

Research methods: 1. Methods for the diagnosis of professional burnout of K. Maslach, S. Jackson in the adaptation of N.Ye. Vodopyanova. 2. Diagnostics of emotional burnout of personality by V.V.

The reliability of the research results is ensured by the methodological validity of the sought positions, the use of methods adequate to the purpose, object and subject of the work, as well as the use of methods of mathematical data processing: the Mann-Whitney U-criterion. The results obtained in the course of the study make it possible to assert that for teachers such drastic changes became significant stress due to a sharp change in the usual teaching system and an urgent need for the operational development of new skills that did not previously affect their professional suitability, which entailed additional psychological load, a state of active tension, a reduction in professional duties, which led to emotional exhaustion, which intensified the symptoms of emotional burnout. Thus, we can conclude that after the transition to distance learning, teachers show a more pronounced level of emotional burnout arising from the influence of factors associated with professional activity, which contribute to personality deformation and the further development of emotional burnout.

This article evaluates the effects of school closures based on standardised tests in the last year of primary school in the Dutch‐speaking Flemish region of Belgium. Using a 6‐year panel, we find that students of the 2020 cohort experienced significant learning losses in three out of five tested subjects, with a decrease in school averages of mathematics scores of 0.17 standard deviations and Dutch scores (reading, writing, language) of 0.19 standard deviations as compared to previous cohorts. This finding holds when accounting for school characteristics, standardised tests in Grade 4 and school fixed effects. Given the large observed effect sizes, the effect of school closures appears to be a combination of lost learning progress and learning loss. Moreover, we observe that inequality both within schools and across schools rises by 7% for mathematics and 8% for Dutch. The learning losses are correlated with observed school characteristics, as schools with a more disadvantaged student population experience larger learning losses.

This threshold corresponds to points where the stability of the system’s equilibrium reaches zero. Consequently, we use the average rate at which deviations from the equilibrium shrink to define a distance to this threshold. However, the vital dynamics of the host population may occur slowly even when transmission is far from threshold levels. Here we show analytically how such slow dynamics can prevent estimation of the distance to the threshold for some individual variables of the model. Although these results are exact only in the limit of long-term observation of a large system, we find that they still provide useful insight into the behaviour of estimates from simulations with a range of population sizes, environmental noise, and observation schemes. Having established some guidelines about when estimates are accurate, we then illustrate how multiple distance estimates can be used to estimate the rate of approach to the threshold. The estimation approach is general and may be applicable to zoonotic pathogens such as MERS-CoV as well as vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles.","O’Dea, Eamon B.; Park, Andrew W.; Drake, John M.",bioRxiv,545,1

In order to characterize the effect of TRV infection on the turkey immune system, classical assays were undertaken to quantify the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in small Beltsville and broad-breasted white poults infected with the TRV isolate NC/SEP-R44/03. A marked effect on the cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity response, and on the antibody response to Newcastle disease virus (NDV) exposure, was noted in commercial and specific pathogen free (SPF) poults inoculated with NC/SEP-R44/03 at three days of age. Moderate to severe bursal atrophy, similar to that noted previously in SPF poults, occurred in commercial poults inoculated at three days of age. This immune dysfunction and bursal atrophy was not present in commercial poults inoculated at three weeks of age.","Day, J Michael; Spackman, Erica; Pantin-Jackwood, Mary J",Avian diseases,545,22

In this article, we introduced a lightweight and field-portable biosensor employing a plasmonic chip based on nanohole arrays integrated to a lensfree-imaging framework for label-free detection of viruses in field-settings. The platform utilizes a CMOS (complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) camera with high quantum efficiency in the spectral window of interest to monitor diffraction field patterns of nanohole arrays under the uniform illumination of an LED (light-emitting diode) source which is spectrally tuned to the plasmonic mode supported by the nanohole arrays. As an example for the applicability of our biosensor for virus detection, we could successfully demonstrate the label-free detection of H1N1 viruses, e.g., swine flu, with medically relevant concentrations. We also developed a low-cost and easy-to-use sample preparation kit to prepare the surface of the plasmonic chip for analyte binding, e.g., virus-antibody binding. In order to reveal a complete biosensor technology, we also developed a user friendly Python™ – based graphical user interface (GUI) that allows direct access to biosensor hardware, taking and processing diffraction field images, and provides virus information to the end-user. Employing highly sensitive nanohole arrays and lensfree-imaging framework, our platform could yield an LOD as low as 103 TCID50/mL. Providing accurate and rapid sensing information in a handheld platform, weighing only 70 g and 12 cm tall, without the need for bulky and expensive instrumentation, our biosensor could be a very strong candidate for diagnostic applications in resource-poor settings. As our detection scheme is based on the use of antibodies, it could quickly adapt to the detection of different viral diseases, e.g., COVID-19 or influenza, by simply coating the plasmonic chip surface with an antibody possessing affinity to the virus type of interest. Possessing this ability, our biosensor could be swiftly deployed to the field in need for rapid diagnosis, which may be an important asset to prevent the spread of diseases before turning into a pandemic by isolating patients from the population.","Cetin, Arif E.; Kocer, Zeynep A.; Topkaya, Seda Nur Yazici Ziya Ata",Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical,545,20

Data were collected after the enactment of the first emergency regulations (between March 15 and April 1, 2020) via the Qualtrics Survey Software link that was sent out through social media platforms. In total, 205 participants aged 65 to 92 (mean age, 72.32; SD, 5.63) reported general anxiety symptom levels (GAD-7) (Spitzer et al., 2006), resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), frequency of receptive arts engagement in the previous year, health status, exposure to risk situations, and behavioral changes due to the pandemic. Our hypothesis that receptive arts would moderate the resilience-COVID-19 anxiety link was examined by a multiple hierarchical regression analysis and with the PROCESS computational tool. Findings show that resilience was associated with COVID-19 anxiety and that this association was moderated by levels of receptive arts engagement. The findings show that high levels of prior art engagement constituted a potent buffer against subsequent COVID-19 anxiety. Policy makers may benefit older adults by encouraging their engagement in arts activities, even during social distancing.","Keisari, Shoshi; Hoffman, Yaakov; Ring, Lia; Palgi, Yuval",J Nerv Ment Dis,545,0

Data were collected during the period when a curfew was imposed for the elderly. Data were analyzed using a structural equation model. According to the structural equation model, anxiety was determined as a predictor of depression. The anxiety levels of the elderly who were 65-74 years old, female, single; had insufficient knowledge about the pandemic; and had not encountered a similar outbreak before considered that family relationships were affected negatively so they became lonely and reported that they became bored, exhausted, and distressed during the pandemic, which increased their depression levels.

An attractive coronavirus drug target is the main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CLpro) because of its vital role in the viral cycle. A significant body of work has been focused on finding inhibitors which bind and block the active site of the main protease, but little has been done to address potential non-competitive inhibition, targeting regions other than the active site, partly because the fundamental biophysics of such allosteric control is still poorly understood. In this work, we construct an elastic network model (ENM) of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro homodimer protein and analyse its dynamics and thermodynamics. We found a rich and heterogeneous dynamical structure, including allosterically correlated motions between the homodimeric protease's active sites. Exhaustive 1-point and 2-point mutation scans of the ENM and their effect on fluctuation free energies confirm previously experimentally identified bioactive residues, but also suggest several new candidate regions that are distant from the active site, yet control the protease function. Our results suggest new dynamically driven control regions as possible candidates for non-competitive inhibiting binding sites in the protease, which may assist the development of current fragment-based binding screens. The results also provide new insights into the active biophysical research field of protein fluctuation allostery and its underpinning dynamical structure.","Dubanevics, Igors; McLeish, Tom C B",J R Soc Interface,545,16

In the treatment of COVID- 19 patients, a significant effect of convalescent plasma (CP) therapy from convalescent patients with SARS-CoV-2 IgG neutralizing antibodies is indicated. After this procedure, the total duration of the infection was shortened and the clinical condition improved faster than in patients who did not receive this form of therapy.

However, according to the literature, 2% of patients who received plasma from convalescents developed Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI). The most common causes of TRALI are anti-leukocyte antibodies directed against Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) class I and II and against Human Neutrophil Antigens (HNA).

Theranostic agents synergized with photothermal ablation are expected to realize the early detection and treatment of orthotopic HCC. However, conventional metallic nanoagents are limited by their potential bio-toxicity to surrounding normal organs. Recently, endogenous biological melanin pigments have been utilized to develop nanoplatforms due to their excellent biocompatibility and degradability. Whereas, the insufficient capability of PEGylated melanin nanoparticles (PEG-MNPs) in photoacoustic (PA) imaging limits their further biomedical applications. Paradoxically, it is difficult to meet these two different requirements. Herein, a multifunctional nanoagent based on melanin (MNPs) conjugating the near-infrared (NIR) dye IR820 was successfully designed and fabricated. Encapsulation by polyethylene glycol (PEG) renders the solubility in water and allows the physical absorption of IR820 for enhanced photoacoustic (PA) performance and photothermal therapy. Besides, PEG coating on the surface of IR820-PEG-MNPs resulted in a reduction in swallowing in the reticuloendothelial system of the liver and spleen, prolonging the circulation time in the blood and increasing the accumulation in the tumor. The IR820-PEG-MNPs displayed satisfactory PA and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals in aqueous solution as well as strong photothermal efficiency. Compared with prior injection, PA/MR signals of the tumor region were enhanced by 4.13- and 1.60-fold, respectively, which could effectively detect lesions smaller than â¼1.8 mm. Furthermore, the high photothermal conversion efficiency (40.2%) endowed the IR820-PEG-MNPs with the capability of selectively ablating tumors in orthotopic HCC mouse models under the guidance of PA/MR imaging. This work broadens the biomedical applications of melanin-based agent, which are promising for the precise diagnosis of orthotopic micro HCC and imaging guided photothermal ablation.","Chen, Kang; Li, Qiaolin; Zhao, Xingyang; Zhang, Jinde; Ma, Haosong; Sun, Xiang; Yu, Qian; Zhang, Yueming; Fang, Chihua; Nie, Liming",Biomater Sci,545,20

The EFM data record the oscillation phase of an atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever as a function of the AFM tip position. In our experiments the relative dielectric constants ï¥ï of the sample are measured from the EFM phase shifts vs. the tip-surface separation, according to a simple analytical model describing the tip-surface interactions. We perform a comprehensive study of how the dielectric constant depends on the fiber diameter for both electrospun PLLA and MWCNT/PLLA fiber composites. Our measurements show that EFM can distinguish between dielectric properties of PLLA fibers and fiber composites with different diameters. Dielectric constants of both PLLA and MWCNT-PLLA composite fibers decrease with increasing fiber diameter. In the limit of large fiber diameters (D > 100 nm), we measure dielectric constants in the range: ï¥ = 3.4-3.8, similar to the values obtained for unoriented PLLA films:ï ï¥film = 2.4-3.8. Moreover, the dielectric constants of the small diameter MWCNT-PLLA composites are significantly larger than the corresponding values obtained for PLLA fibers. For MWCNT-PLLA nanofiber composites of small diameters (D < 50 nm), ï¥ approaches the values measured for neat MWCNT:ï ï¥CN = 12 ± 2. These results are consistent with a simple fiber structural model that shows higher polarizability of thinner fibers, and composites that contain MWCNTs. The experimental method has a high-resolution for measuring the dielectric constant of soft materials, and is simple to implement on standard atomic force microscopes.

DKA was diagnosed with glucose 690 mg/dL, bicarbonate 4 mmol/L, serum β-hydroxybutyrate 5.8 mmol/L and pH 6.6. He was resuscitated with intravenous fluids and an insulin infusion was started. DKA resolved after 5 days and he was discharged home on subcutaneous insulin. He remained insulin-dependent on follow-up. Conclusion: New-onset diabetes with DKA due to SARS-CoV-2 is increasingly recognized, and beta-cell dysfunction can be permanent, resulting in insulin-dependent diabetes. Accordingly, our patients remained insulin-dependent several months post discharge.","Ramos-Yataco, Anthony Capcha Kelly Jasmin Meza Harbuz-Miller Inga",Journal of the Endocrine Society,545,2

There are no FDA-approved antivirals or vaccines for any coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2. Current treatments for COVID-19 are limited to supportive therapies and off-label use of FDA-approved drugs. Rapid development and human testing of potential antivirals is urgently needed. Numerous drugs are already approved for human use, and subsequently, there is a good understanding of their safety profiles and potential side effects, making them easier to fast-track to clinical studies in COVID-19 patients. Here, we present data on the antiviral activity of 20 FDA-approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that also inhibit SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). We found that 17 of these inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at non-cytotoxic concentrations. We directly followed up seven of these to demonstrate that all are capable of inhibiting infectious SARS-CoV-2 production. Moreover, we evaluated two of these, chloroquine and chlorpromazine, in vivo using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV model and found that both drugs protect mice from clinical disease.IMPORTANCE There are no FDA-approved antivirals for any coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2.

After a slowdown in the epidemic, on 6 May, 2020, the regulatory authorities decided to relax the implemented measures. However, the epidemiological situation soon worsened again. As of 7 February, 2021, a total of 406,352 cases of SARSCov-2 infection have been reported in Serbia, 4,112 deaths caused by COVID-19. In order to better understand the epidemic dynamics and predict possible outcomes, we have developed an adaptive mathematical model SEAIHRDS (S-susceptible, E-exposed, A-asymptomatic, I-infected, H-hospitalized, R-recovered, D-dead due to COVID-19 infection, S-susceptible). The model can be used to simulate various scenarios of the implemented intervention measures and calculate possible epidemic outcomes, including the necessary hospital capacities. Considering promising results regarding the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, the model is extended to simulate vaccination among different population strata. The findings from various simulation scenarios have shown that, with implementation of strict measures of contact reduction, it is possible to control COVID-19 and reduce number of deaths. The findings also show that limiting effective contacts within the most susceptible population strata merits a special attention. However, the findings also show that the disease has a potential to remain in the population for a long time, likely with a seasonal pattern. If a vaccine, with efficacy equal or higher than 65%, becomes available it could help to significantly slow down or completely stop circulation of the virus in human population. The effects of vaccination depend primarily on: 1. Efficacy of available vaccine(s), 2. Prioritization of the population categories for vaccination, and 3. Overall vaccination coverage of the population, assuming that the vaccine(s) develop solid immunity in vaccinated individuals. With expected basic reproduction number of Ro=2.46 and vaccine efficacy of 68%, an 87% coverage would be sufficient to stop the virus circulation.","Stanojevic, Slavoljub; Ponjavic, Mirza; Stanojevic, Slobodan; Stevanovic, Aleksandar; Radojicic, Sonja",Microb Risk Anal,545,16

However, few researches focused on exosomes derived from gingival fibroblasts (GFs) of IGF. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of exosomes derived from GFs of IGF (IGF-GFs) on the proliferation and apoptosis of normal gingival fibroblasts (N-GFs). METHODS: Gingival fibroblasts were cultured and identified using immunocytochemistry. Exosomes were isolated with exosomes extraction kit and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and flow cytometry. PKH67 labeling was further used to trace the intracellular distribution of the exosomes. And MTS assay was used to test the effective concentration and time course of IGF-GFs-derived exosomes. Furthermore, the expression of PCNA, Ki67, Bcl-2, and Bax in N-GFs was analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: Exosomes were isolated from IGF-GFs; the identification of exosomes and gingival fibroblasts was successfully finished. Moreover, we found that N-GFs co-cultured with exosomes showed a great increase in PCNA and Bcl-2 levels, and a moderate increase in Ki67 levels. By contrast, the levels of Bax were significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that exosomes derived from idiopathic gingival fibroma fibroblasts are involved in the regulation of gingival fibroblast proliferation and apoptosis.","Yin, Shunhui; Jia, Fengmei; Ran, Liquan; Xie, Liangkun; Wu, Zhiyao; Zhan, Yeming; Zhang, Yan; Zhang, Mingzhu",Oral dis,545,16

We show that, with a careful optimization of laser-induced heating and heat-removal geometry, this approach can radically shorten the qPCR thermal cycle relative to standard PCR systems, paving the way toward credit-card-size testing kits for fast point-of-care infection diagnosis. Faster photonic qPCR/qRT-PCR will enable a rapid and highly specific early detection of infections, including new viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 at very early stages-in most cases, even before the onset of disease, providing much-needed lead time for early treatment and disease spread prevention.","Vincent, C.; Voronin, A.

Here, we report the results of the irAE analysis and the potential correlation between irAEs and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1010 patients were included in this analysis; after a 6-week landmark selection, 877 (86.8%) patients were included in the efficacy analysis. Any grade irAEs (P < .0001), grade 3/4 irAEs (P = .0025), leading to discontinuation irAEs (P = .0144), multiple-site and single-site irAEs (P < .0001), cutaneous irAEs (P = .0001), endocrine irAEs (P = .0227), pulmonary irAEs (P = .0479), and rheumatologic irAEs (P = .0018) were significantly related to a higher objective response rate.

Psychiatry services were also affected with the imposed reduction of non-urgent consultations. We aim to explore the effect of these changes on a Psychiatry Emergency Service during COVID-19 lockdown in Spain. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients admitted to our Psychiatric Emergency Service 90 days before and after March 14th, 2020, the first day of lockdown in Spain. Extracted data were compared between the two periods. Poisson regression analysis was performed to analyze changes in admission rates. RESULTS: 1,958 psychiatric emergency admissions were analyzed. Although the number of admissions decreased by 37.9%, we observed a significant increase in the percentage of acute psychiatric hospitalization during the lockdown. Anxiety spectrum disorders accumulated the greatest significant decrease in admission rates during the lockdown. On the other hand, a significant increase in admissions rates was found in patients with dementia, autism spectrum disorders, and substance use disorders during the lockdown. LIMITATIONS: This study was conducted in a single psychiatric emergency service, preventing a generalization of our results. The comparison time period might have biased our results due to the influence of external factors. CONCLUSION: Mental health consequences of COVID-19 are becoming apparent.

The aim of this study was to analyse changes in conjunctival impression cytology with transfer and both lachrymal stability and flow tests in patients with dry eye disease after treatment with autologous serum eye drops. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conjunctival impression cytology and lachrymal flow and stability tests, namely Schirmer's and tear break-up time, were prospectively studied in patients with dry eye disease before and 1 month after treatment with autologous serum eye drops. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (23 women, mean age 53.8±12.6 years) were included in the study. Ten patients (41.7%) had moderate and six (25.0%) had severe dry eye disease. Five patients had rheumatoid arthritis. After treatment, the number and density of conjunctival goblet cells, their size, the size of their nuclei and the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio increased significantly (202.3±107.5 vs 210.1±100.9 cells/mm2, p<0.01). Seven of ten patients with grade 3 or 4 metaplasia had an improvement in the degree of metaplasia. Both Schirmer's test and tear break-up time improved significantly in this subgroup of patients. In the multivariate study, the increase in conjunctival goblet cells was associated with the number of goblet cells and the size of the cytoplasm at baseline. No adverse reactions were noted.

SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies that compared deceased and survived pregnant women with COVID-19. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Relevant data were extracted and tabulated. The primary outcome was maternal co-morbidity. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen studies with 154 deceased patients were included. Obesity doubled the risk of death (relative risk [RR] 2.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-4.36, I2 = 0%). No differences were found for gestational diabetes (RR 5.71; 95% CI 0.77-42.44, I2 = 94%) or asthma (RR 2.05, 95% CI 0.81-5.15, I2 = 0%).

The objective was to assess the efficacy of our preoperative screening algorithm. METHODS: This observational retrospective study was performed between the 25th of March and the 12th of May 2020 in a comprehensive cancer center in France. Patients undergoing elective oncologic surgery were tested by preoperative nasopharyngeal reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that could be associated with a chest computerized tomography (CT) scan. RESULTS: Of the 510 screening tests (in 477 patients), only 5% (15/477) were positive for COVID-19 in 24 patients (18 RT-PCR+ and 7 CT scan+/RT-PCR-). Four patients were ultimately false positives based on the CT scan. In total, only 4.2% (20/477) of the patients were COVID-19+. The positivity rate decreased with time after the containment measures were implemented (from 7.4% to 0.8%). In the COVID-19+ group, 20% of the patients had postoperative pulmonary complications, whereas this was the case for 5% of the patients in the COVID-19 group.

Failure to address the mental health issues stemming from the pandemic is likely to prolong its impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a significant global challenge and, in lower-income countries, even a disruption of mental health services. Given our experience with previous pandemics, the present COVID-19 crisis can be expected to cause psychological trauma, and steps are needed to address this issue proactively. A focus on the long-term mental health consequences may be at least as important as the measures currently seeking to mitigate the short-term effects of COVID-19 and to save lives. The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for mental health call for a greater focus on the needs of those with mental disorders and on mental health issues affecting health care workers and the general public. Timely preventive and therapeutic mental health care is essential in addressing the psychosocial needs of populations exposed to the pandemic. In addition to specialist care, ""task-shifting"" and digital technologies may provide cost-effective means of providing mental health care in lower-income countries worldwide as well as in higher-income countries with mental health services overwhelmed by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In view of the ever-increasing pressure on global health systems resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, adopting and adapting ""task-shifting"", i.e. the delegation of psychotherapeutic interventions to trained non-specialists, as an element of the provision of mental health services, is overdue. Digital technologies can be used to enhance social support and facilitate resilience to the detrimental mental health effects of the pandemic; they may also offer an efficient and cost-effective way to provide easy access to mental health care.","Lange, Klaus W",,545,9

Recently, we reported safety, tolerability and antibody response data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded phase I/II coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine trial with BNT162b1, a lipid nanoparticle-formulated nucleoside-modified mRNA that encodes the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein1. Here we present antibody and T cell responses after vaccination with BNT162b1 from a second, non-randomized open-label phase I/II trial in healthy adults, 18-55 years of age. Two doses of 1-50 µg of BNT162b1 elicited robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and strong antibody responses, with RBD-binding IgG concentrations clearly above those seen in serum from a cohort of individuals who had recovered from COVID-19. Geometric mean titres of SARS-CoV-2 serum-neutralizing antibodies on day 43 were 0.7-fold (1-µg dose) to 3.5-fold (50-µg dose) those of the recovered individuals. Immune sera broadly neutralized pseudoviruses with diverse SARS-CoV-2 spike variants. Most participants had T helper type 1 (TH1)-skewed T cell immune responses with RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell expansion. Interferon-Î³ was produced by a large fraction of RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. The robust RBD-specific antibody, T cell and favourable cytokine responses induced by the BNT162b1 mRNA vaccine suggest that it has the potential to protect against COVID-19 through multiple beneficial mechanisms.","Sahin, Ugur; Muik, Alexander; Derhovanessian, Evelyna; Vogler, Isabel; Kranz, Lena M; Vormehr, Mathias; Baum, Alina; Pascal, Kristen; Quandt, Jasmin; Maurus, Daniel; Brachtendorf, Sebastian; Lörks, Verena; Sikorski, Julian; Hilker, Rolf; Becker, Dirk; Eller, Ann-Kathrin; Grützner, Jan; Boesler, Carsten; Rosenbaum, Corinna; Kühnle, Marie-Cristine; Luxemburger, Ulrich; Kemmer-Brück, Alexandra; Langer, David; Bexon, Martin; Bolte, Stefanie; Karikó, Katalin; Palanche, Tania; Fischer, Boris; Schultz, Armin; Shi, Pei-Yong; Fontes-Garfias, Camila; Perez, John L; Swanson, Kena A; Loschko, Jakob; Scully, Ingrid L; Cutler, Mark; Kalina, Warren; Kyratsous, Christos A; Cooper, David; Dormitzer, Philip R; Jansen, Kathrin U; Türeci, Özlem",Nature,545,1

A brief prelude on the current state of affairs with COVID-19 is given. In addition to an overview of ACE2, Ang II, and Ang (1-7), this review presents a brief statement on hypertension, including the function of enzymes involved in the control of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and other malignancies. RECENT FINDINGS: There is currently no data in support of the concerns raised with the use of ACEIs/ARBs. Many researchers have voiced concerns that the use of ACEIs and ARBs may increase tissue ACE2 levels. These researchers therefore recommend that individuals on ACEIs/ARB's medications withhold such antihypertensive drugs, unless advised by their physicians to do so. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptors as the port of entry to human hosts. ACE2 and ACE are different enzymes and ACE inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2. Therefore, the use of ARB's or ACEIs should not be discontinued if an individual is infected by SARS-CoV-2. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression and COVID-19.","Gathiram, Premjith; Mackraj, Irene; Moodley, Jagidesa",Curr Hypertens Rep,545,16

A novel coronavirus was eventually identified, and became the COVID-19 epidemic that affected public health and life. We investigated the psychological status and behavior changes of the general public in China from January 30 to February 3, 2020. METHODS: Respondents were recruited via social media (WeChat) and completed an online questionnaire. We used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Self-rating Depression Scale, and Symptom Checklist-90 to evaluate psychological status. We also investigated respondents' behavior changes. Quantitative data were analyzed by t-tests or analysis of variance, and classified data were analyzed with chi-square tests. RESULTS: In total, 608 valid questionnaires were obtained. More respondents had state anxiety than trait anxiety (15.8% vs 4.0%). Depression was found among 27.1% of respondents and 7.7% had psychological abnormalities. About 10.1% of respondents suffered from phobia. Our analysis of the relationship between subgroup characteristics and psychological status showed that age, gender, knowledge about COVID-19, degree of worry about epidemiological infection, and confidence about overcoming the outbreak significantly influenced psychological status. Around 93.3% of respondents avoided going to public places and almost all respondents reduced Spring Festival-related activities. At least 70.9% of respondents chose to take three or more preventive measures to avoid infection. The three most commonly used prevention measures were making fewer trips outside and avoiding contact (98.0%), wearing a mask (83.7%), and hand hygiene (82.4%). CONCLUSIONS: We need to pay more attention to public psychological stress, especially among young people, as they are likely to experience anxiety, depression, and psychological abnormalities. Different psychological interventions could be formulated according to the psychological characteristics of different gender and age groups. The majority of respondents followed specific behaviors required by the authorities, but it will take time to observe the effects of these behaviors on the epidemic.","Liu, Xi; Luo, Wen-Tao; Li, Ying; Li, Chun-Na; Hong, Zhong-Si; Chen, Hui-Li; Xiao, Fei; Xia, Jin-Yu",Infect Dis Poverty,545,20

However, the economic value and health system impact of remdesivir treatment is still unclear. This study evaluated remdesivir’s long-term cost-effectiveness and impact on health system capacities versus standard of care (SoC) for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States (US). Methods: A hybrid decision-tree and Markov model simulated health and economic outcomes for hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients (average age of 58.9 years) from a US health system perspective over a lifetime horizon. Clinical inputs (e.g., hospitalization duration, mortality) were extracted from the ACC2 - -1 trial and real-world data. Cost inputs were sourced from an internal analysis or from the literature. Remdesivir acquisition cost was $390/vial, and patients were assumed to receive 6.25 vials per treatment course. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. A separate treatment capacity analysis was performed on a national scale, assuming a population of 328,200,000 and one monthly incident cohort of 201,000 patients eligible for treatment. Results: Relative to SoC, remdesivir was associated with a decrease in total costs (savings of $8,844.49 per patient), increased life years (+0.62), and quality-adjusted life years (+0.47). Remdesivir was therefore dominant versus SoC (less costly and more effective). Results were robust in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In the treatment capacity analysis, remdesivir increased the available hospital capacity by 1.4%, available ICU capacity by 32.1%, and total ventilator capacity by 2.3%. Conclusions: Remdesivir is a cost-effective option for the treatment of patients hospitalized with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 versus SoC. In addition, due to its demonstrated ability to shorten time to recovery, remdesivir is projected to increase treatment capacity by increasing the percentage of available hospital bed-, ICU bed-, and total ventilator capacity.","Sun, F.; Jeyakumar, S.; Smith, N.",Value in Health,545,1

BACKGROUND: The stress level of clinical nurses directly affects their physical and mental health and work efficiency. DESIGN: This study was a cross-sectional investigation, which was performed following the STROBE checklist. The current study was conducted in February 2020 by selecting clinical nurses from the Zigong First People's Hospital for investigation. METHODS: At the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we assessed clinical nurses with the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire, the General Self-Efficacy Scale and the Perceived Social Support Scale. Specifically, the nurses were divided into three groups: (a) nurses supporting Wuhan; (b) nurses in the department of treating the COVID-19 patients in our hospital (epidemic department); and (c) nurses in the general department without the COVID-19 patients in our hospital (non-epidemic department). RESULTS: A total of 1092 clinical nurses were surveyed with 94 nurses in Wuhan, 130 nurses treating COVID-19 patients in our hospital and 868 nurses working without direct contact with diagnosed COVID-19 patients. The mean stress score of all surveyed nurses was 33.15 (SD: 25.551). There was a statistically significant difference in stress response scores between different departments. Noticeably, the nurses who went to support in Wuhan showed a weaker stress response than the nurses who stayed in our hospital (mean: 19.98 (Wuhan) vs. 32.70 (epidemic department in our hospital) vs. 34.64 (non-epidemic department in our hospital)). In addition, stress was negatively correlated with general self-efficacy and perceived social support. CONCLUSION: The present study suggested that the stress status of second-line nurse without direct contact with diagnosed COVID-19 patients was more severe than that of first-line nurses who had direct contact with COVID-19 patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Our study indicated the importance of psychological status of second-line medical staff during the global pandemic.","Liao, Changju; Guo, Linghong; Zhang, Cuicui; Zhang, Meiqi; Jiang, Wenjing; Zhong, Ying; Lin, Qingfang; Liu, Yin",J. clin. nurs,545,16

Methods: United States adults (N = 1607) completed a health-related questionnaire during COVID-19 and associated shelter-in-place. We categorized respondents into 4 groups of SWF at the time of the pandemic: ""Never,"" ""< 1x a week,"" ""1x a week,"" or ""> 1x a week."" Results: The proportion of adults never weighing increased during the pandemic (15% to 25%), whereas the proportion of those weighing < 1x week went down (41% to 29%). Higher SWF was significantly associated with changes in energy expenditure including increased total physical activity (PA), lower likelihood of decreases in vigorous, moderate, and walking PA, and a lower likelihood of sitting more. More frequent self-weighing also was associated statistically with lower likelihood of keeping unhealthy eating behaviors the same. Conversely, there was no significant difference in changes in alcohol, caffeine, takeout, fruit or vegetable consumption, and television viewing among SWF groups. Conclusion: SWF decreased during the pandemic in the lower 2 SWF categories.

To better understand these wide variations, we assessed different factors affecting countermeasure implementation rates and applied the capability, opportunity, motivation model of behaviour to describe their determinants. DESIGN: We undertook this international mixed methods study of increased depth and breadth to obtain more complete data and to better understand the resulting complex evidence. SETTING: This study was conducted in 14 paediatric nephrology centres across 12 European countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: The 14 participants were paediatric nephrologists and EPDWG members from 12 European centres. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 52 countermeasures clustered into eight response domains (access control, patient testing, personnel testing, personal protective equipment policy, patient cohorting, personnel cohorting, suspension of routine care, remote work) were categorised by implementation status, drivers (expert opinion, hospital regulations) and resource dependency. Governmental strictness and media attitude were independently assessed for each country and correlated with relevant countermeasure implementation factors. RESULTS: Implementation rates varied widely among response domains (median 49.5%, range 20%-71%) and centres (median 46%, range 31%-62%). Case loads were insufficient to explain response rate variability. Increasing case loads resulted in shifts from expert opinion-based to hospital regulation-based decisions to implement additional countermeasures despite increased resource dependency. Higher governmental strictness and positive media attitude towards countermeasure implementation were associated with higher implementation rates. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 countermeasure implementation by paediatric tertiary care centres did not reflect case loads but rather reflected heterogeneity of local rules and of perceived resources. These data highlight the need of ongoing reassessment of current practices, facilitating rapid change in 'institutional behavior' in response to emerging evidence of countermeasure efficacy.","Eibensteiner, Fabian; Ritschl, Valentin; Stamm, Tanja; Cetin, Asil; Schmitt, Claus Peter; Ariceta, Gema; Bakkaloglu, Sevcan; Jankauskiene, Augustina; Klaus, Günter; Paglialonga, Fabio; Edefonti, Alberto; Ranchin, Bruno; Shroff, Rukshana; Stefanidis, Constantinos J; Vandewalle, Johan; Verrina, Enrico; Vondrak, Karel; Zurowska, Aleksandra; Alper, Seth L; Aufricht, Christoph",BMJ Open,545,17

In the face of the sudden pandemic, workforce mobilization has been of critical concern to medical institutions. During the pandemic, the public's behaviors of seeking medical assistance have also changed. Using the real-world data of a large medical center in Taiwan, this study aimed to analyze the fluctuations of outpatient visits among various departments and divisions in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide suggestions for staff allocation in similar future events. METHODS: Data of outpatient visits at Taipei Veterans General Hospital were obtained for analysis. The weekly fluctuations of outpatient visits among 36 departments or divisions were computed for the 8 weeks from February 3 to March 29, 2020, the early phase of the pandemic. The monthly data of outpatient visits by department and division in March 2020 were also extracted for comparison with those in March 2019. A simple regression equation was used to calculate the weekly trends. RESULTS: Average outpatient visits decreased by 26% in the 2 months following the outbreak. Among the 36 departments or divisions, ophthalmology, orthopedics, and cardiology underwent marked declines after the outbreak; the slopes of the simple regression equation were -110.8, -100.7, and -99.2, respectively. By contrast, transfusion medicine, toxicology, transplantation surgery, pediatric surgery, chest surgery, technical aid, and oncology were divisions less influenced. In the year-over-year comparison, infection was the only department or division with positive growth (20.5%), whereas all others exhibited negative growth.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of adult mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients admitted to five Johns Hopkins hospitals was conducted between March and August 2020. CAPA was defined using composite clinical criteria. Fine and Gray competing risks regression was used to analyze clinical outcomes and multilevel mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression was used to compare longitudinal disease severity scores. RESULTS: Amongst the cohort of 396 people, 39 met criteria for CAPA. Compared to those without, patients with CAPA were more likely to have underlying pulmonary vascular disease (41% vs 21.6%, p=0.01), liver disease (35.9% vs 18.2%, p=0.02), coagulopathy (51.3% vs 33.1%, p=0.03), solid tumors (25.6% vs 10.9%, p=0.017), multiple myeloma (5.1% vs 0.3%, p=0.027), corticosteroid exposure during index admission (66.7% vs 42.6%, p=0.005), and had a lower BMI (median 26.6 vs 29.9, p=0.04).

However, the identification of the placental lesions due to SARS-CoV-2 infection would be a significant advance in order to improve the management of these pregnancies and to identify the mechanisms involved in a possible vertical transmission. The pathological findings in placentas delivered from 198 SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women were investigated for the presence of lesions associated with placental SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection was investigated in placental tissues through immunohistochemistry, and positive cases were further confirmed by in situ hybridization. SARS-CoV-2 infection was also investigated by RT-PCR in 33 cases, including all the immunohistochemically positive cases. Nine cases were SARS-CoV-2-positive by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and RT-PCR. These placentas showed lesions characterized by villous trophoblast necrosis with intervillous space collapse and variable amounts of mixed intervillous inflammatory infiltrate and perivillous fibrinoid deposition. Such lesions ranged from focal to massively widespread in five cases, resulting in intrauterine fetal death. Two of the stillborn fetuses showed some evidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. The remaining 189 placentas did not show similar lesions. The strong association between trophoblastic damage and placenta SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that this lesion is a specific marker of SARS-CoV-2 infection in placenta. Diffuse trophoblastic damage, massively affecting chorionic villous tissue, can result in fetal death associated with COVID-19 disease.","Garrido-Pontnou, Marta; Navarro, Alexandra; Camacho, Jessica; Crispi, Fàtima; Alguacil-Guillén, Marina; Moreno-Baró, Anna; Hernandez-Losa, Javier; Sesé, Marta; Ramón Y Cajal, Santiago; Garcia Ruíz, Itziar; Serrano, Berta; Garcia-Aguilar, Paula; Suy, Anna; Ferreres, Joan Carles; Nadal, Alfons",Mod. pathol,545,1

The number of interventions for antimicrobial resistance is increasing but current research has major limitations in terms of efforts, methods, scope, quality, and reporting. Moving the agenda forwards requires an improved understanding of the diversity of interventions, their feasibility and cost-benefit, the implementation factors that shape and underpin their effectiveness, and the ways in which individual interventions might interact synergistically or antagonistically to influence actions against antimicrobial resistance in different contexts. Within the efforts to strengthen the global governance of antimicrobial resistance, we advocate for the creation of an international One Health platform for online learning. The platform will synthesise the evidence for actions on antimicrobial resistance into a fully accessible database; generate new scientific insights into the design, implementation, evaluation, and reporting of the broad range of interventions relevant to addressing antimicrobial resistance; and ultimately contribute to the goal of building societal resilience to this central challenge of the 21st century.","Wernli, Didier; Jørgensen, Peter S; Parmley, E Jane; Troell, Max; Majowicz, Shannon; Harbarth, Stephan; Léger, Anaïs; Lambraki, Irene; Graells, Tiscar; Henriksson, Patrik J G; Carson, Carolee; Cousins, Melanie; Skoog Ståhlgren, Gunilla; Mohan, Chadag V; Simpson, Andrew J H; Wieland, Barbara; Pedersen, Karl; Schneider, Annegret; Chandy, Sujith J; Wijayathilaka, Tikiri Priyantha; Delamare-Deboutteville, Jérôme; Vila, Jordi; Stålsby Lundborg, Cecilia; Pittet, Didier",Lancet infect. dis,545,1

Recent studies have reported interactions between statin treatment and COVID-19-related outcomes. The study reported here specifically assessed the association between routine statin use and COVID-19-related outcomes in inpatients with T2DM. METHODS: The Coronavirus-SARS-CoV-2 and Diabetes Outcomes (CORONADO) study was a nationwide observational study aiming to describe the phenotypic characteristics and prognosis of T2DM patients with COVID-19 admitted to 68 French hospitals between 10 March and 10 April 2020. The composite primary outcome comprised tracheal intubation and/or death within 7 and 28 days of admission. The association between statin use and outcomes was estimated by logistic regression analysis after applying inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using a propensity score-weighting approach. RESULTS: Of the 2449 patients with T2DM (881 women, 1568 men; aged 70.9 ± 12.5 years) suitable for analysis, 1192 (49%) were using statin treatment before admission. In unadjusted analyses, patients using statins had rates of the primary outcome similar to those of non-users within both 7 (29.8% vs 27.0%, respectively; P = 0.1338) and 28 days (36.2% vs 33.8%, respectively; P = 0.2191) of admission. However, mortality rates were significantly higher in statin users within 7 (12.8% vs 9.8%, respectively; P = 0.02) and 28 days (23.9% vs 18.2%, respectively; P < 0.001). After applying IPTW, significant associations were observed with statin use and the primary outcome within 7 days (OR [95% CI]: 1.38 [1.04-1.83]) and with death within both 7 (OR [95% CI]: 1.74 [1.13-2.65]) and 28 days (OR [95% CI]: 1.46 [1.08-1.95]).

Our study aimed to evaluate the relationship between 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) level, the most representative metabolite of VitD status, and polymorphism of the cytochrome P450, CYP27B1 gene, which influence vitamin D metabolism, and serum levels, in SLE Tunisian patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study has been conducted in SLE patients (supplemented and not supplemented patients), matched to healthy controls by age and gender. The 25[OH]D serum level was measured by chemiluminescence assay and CYP27B1-1260 genetic polymorphism was carried out using PCR-RFLP methods. Statistical analysis was made using Shesis and SPSS.20 Software. RESULTS: Controls and Vit D not supplemented patients' groups presented the highest percentage of hypovitaminosis D. A significant difference in the mean level of circulating 25[OH]D between Vit D supplemented SLE patients and controls was observed (23.91 ng/ml and 7.18 ng/ml, respectively p = 3.4 105 ). Our results showed a correlation of high 25[OH]D level with complement component 3 levels and prednisolone drug. Moreover, the analysis of CYP27B1-1260 polymorphism in SLE patients and controls revealed a nonsignificant allelic or genotypic association. CONCLUSION: Despite the sunny climate, the high prevalence of Vit D deficiency is common in Tunisia. This hypovitaminosis D feature may affect the Vit D levels in our SLE patients but a direct association with the disease or with the genetically determined features remains unclear. More studies are needed to establish thresholds and susceptibility genes according to the characteristics of each population.","Fakhfakh, Raouia; Feki, Sawsan; Elleuch, Aida; Neifar, Manel; Marzouk, Sameh; Elloumi, Nesrine; Hachicha, Hend; Abida, Olfa; Bahloul, Zouhir; Ayadi, Fatma; Masmoudi, Hatem",Mol Genet Genomic Med,545,1

Obesity is one of the major comorbidities that are related to complications in the course of the disease. Obesity is characterized by a chronic low grade of inflammation and it is proposed that abnormal gut microbiota together with increased gut permeability are risk factors of this pathology. The aim of the present study was to conduct a descriptive research and investigate about the imbalance in the gastrointestinal microbiota (dysbiosis) in patients with COVID-19 and obesity. A library research using the electronic databases PubMed and Google Scholar was performed. The full search strategy combined terms from three themes: COVID-19, obesity, and gut microbiota. Terms were searched as both keywords (title/abstract words) and a comprehensive list of MeSH terms related to each theme. Titles and abstracts were reviewed for relevance and then screened considering the full text content. Network maps were also generated to evaluate the co-ocurrence terms in the papers analyzed using VOSviewer 1.6.14 software. Several studies indicate that gut microbiota is altered in COVID-19 patients showing a decrease in abundance and diversity. Different opportunistic pathogens were found increased in COVID-19 patients including Collinsella, Streptococcus, Morganella, Rothia, Veillonella, Erysipelatoclostridium, Actinomyces, Coprobacillus and Clostridium. Many of them were associated with an increased in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, inflammatory markers, or COVID-19 disease severity. Fecal fungal microbiome was also altered showing an enrichment of fungal pathogens from the genera Candida and Aspergillus. There is a correlation between the bacterial species present in the gut microbiota of COVID-19 patients and in patients with obesity. This was observed principally in the increment of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria and the decrease of Bacteroidetes. Modulation of gut microbiota with prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics are suggested to be used in patients with COVID-19. The present study contributes to highlight the importance of gastrointestinal microflora in COVID-19 patients with obesity as well as the necessity to study specifically this population which report a higher risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Further studies are needed to evaluate potential treatments to reestablish gut microbiome, reduce inflammation, and improve immune function considering the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal tract.","Massip Copiz, María Macarena",The FASEB Journal,545,1

Remdesivir has already been tested for Ebola virus disease treatment and found to have activity against SARS and MERS coronaviruses. The remdesivir core contains GS-441524, which interferes with RNA-dependent RNA polymerases alone. In non-human primates, following IV administration, remdesivir is rapidly distributed into PBMCs and converted within 2 h to the active nucleoside triphosphate form, while GS-441524 is detectable in plasma for up to 24 h. Nevertheless, remdesivir pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in humans are still unexplored, highlighting the need for a precise analytical method for remdesivir and GS-441524 quantification. OBJECTIVES: The validation of a reliable UHPLC-MS/MS method for remdesivir and GS-441524 quantification in human plasma. METHODS: Remdesivir and GS-441524 standards and quality controls were prepared in plasma from healthy donors. Sample preparation consisted of protein precipitation, followed by dilution and injection into the QSight 220 UHPLC-MS/MS system. Chromatographic separation was obtained through an Acquity HSS T3 1.8 µm, 2.1â×â50 mm column, with a gradient of water and acetonitrile with 0.05% formic acid. The method was validated using EMA and FDA guidelines. RESULTS: Analyte stability has been evaluated and described in detail. The method successfully fulfilled the validation process and it was demonstrated that, when possible, sample thermal inactivation could be a good choice in order to improve biosafety.

DESIGN: Case series, retrospective analysis. SETTING: Single institution. PARTICIPANTS: Ten patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patient characteristics, mortality, stroke rate, and length of stay data were collected in all patients. In addition, laboratory values of D-dimer and C-reactive protein and standard measurements of prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time were collected on all patients. Ten patients, each confirmed with COVID-19 via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, were supported on VV ECMO for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) for a mean duration of 9.4 ± 7 days. Four of 10 patients had hemorrhagic strokes, 3 of which resulted in death.

The aim of this study was to develop a procedure to test the performance of alternative RPEs used in the care of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A laboratory-based test was developed to compare RPEs by total inward leakage (TIL). We used a crossflow nebulizer to produce a jet spray of 1-100 µm water droplets with a fluorescent marker. The RPEs were placed on a dummy head and sprayed at distances of 30 and 60 cm. The outcome was determined as the recovery of the fluorescent marker on a membrane filter placed on the mouth of the dummy head. RESULTS: At 30 cm, a type IIR surgical mask gave a 17.7% lower TIL compared with an FFP2 respirator. At 60 cm, this difference was similar, with a 21.7% lower TIL for the surgical mask compared to the respirator.

Methods This prospective and cross-sectional study included 360 low-risk singleton pregnancies between 20 and 36 + 6 weeks of gestation. MAPSE, TAPSE, and SAPSE were measured by M-mode in real time in an apical or basal four-chamber view through placing the cursor at the atrioventricular junction, marked by the valve rings at the tricuspid, mitral, and basal septum, respectively. A regression analysis was done to determine the appropriate polynomial equation model for both measurements and standard deviation (SD) values in relation to gestational age (GA). The intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was evaluated using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and limits of agreement (LoA). Results There was a significant positive correlation between MAPSE (r=0.705, p<0.0001), TAPSE (r=0.804, p<0.0001), and SAPSE (r=0.690, p<0.0001) and GA. The mean of each parameter ranged as follows: 2.87-5.56 mm, MAPSE; 3.98-8.07 mm, TAPSE; and 2.34-4.21 mm, SAPSE. Poor/moderate intra- and inter-observer reliability (CCC between 0.70 and 0.90) and poor/moderate agreement of all the tested parameters were evaluated (LoA between 10 and 50%).

The paper examines the impact of COVID-19 on the Indian stock and commodity markets during the different phases of lockdown. In addition, the effect of COVID-19 on the Indian stock and commodity markets during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 spread was compared. A comparative analysis of the stock market performances and sustainability of selected South Asian countries is also included in the study, which covers the lockdown period as well as the time frame of the first and second waves of COVID-19 spread. To examine the above relationship, the conventional Welch test, heteroskedastic independent t-test, and the GMM multivariate analysis is employed, on the stock return, gold prices, and oil prices. The findings conclude that during the different phases of lockdown in India, COVID-19 has a negative and significant impact on oil prices and stock market performance. However, in terms of gold prices, the effect is positive and significant. The results of the first wave of COVID-19 infection also corroborate with the above findings. However, the results are contradictory during the second wave of coronavirus infection. Furthermore, the study also substantiates that COVID-19 has significantly affected the stock market performances of selected South Asian countries. However, the impact on the stock market performances was only for a short period and it diminished in the second wave of COVID-19 spread in all the selected South Asian countries. The findings contribute to the research on the stock and commodity market impact of a pandemic by providing empirical evidence that COVID-19 has spill-over effects on stock markets and commodity market performances.

However, might there be some individuals for whom job loss may be so detrimental that they experience high levels of worry even if they view job loss as less likely?

We examined how economic job dependency relates to different profiles of JI experiences as well as the implications of these profiles for understanding heterogeneity in work strain. Latent profile analysis using the U.S. International Social Survey Program data set, and replicated in the U.K. data set, revealed three profiles: Employees who are secure in their role and do not worry about potential job loss (secure alignment profile), those who worry significantly about job loss despite perceiving minimal job threats (affective JI misalignment profile), and employees who worry to some extent and perceive minimal job threats (ambivalent JI alignment profile). As anticipated, several economic job dependence factors (perceived employability and education) were predictors of profile membership. Further, those in the affective JI misalignment profile reported the greatest amount of strain. We discuss our results in terms of implications for JI theory and organizational practice.

Stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Stroke is not a single disease but can be caused by a wide range of risk factors, disease processes and mechanisms. Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for stroke, although its contribution differs for different subtypes. Most (85%) strokes are ischaemic, predominantly caused by small vessel arteriolosclerosis, cardioembolism and large artery athero-thromboembolism. Ischaemic strokes in younger patients can result from a different spectrum of causes such as extracranial dissection. Approximately 15% of strokes worldwide are the result of intracerebral haemorrhage, which can be deep (basal ganglia, brainstem), cerebellar or lobar. Deep haemorrhages usually result from deep perforator (hypertensive) arteriopathy (arteriolosclerosis), while lobar haemorrhages are mainly caused by cerebral amyloid angiopathy or arteriolosclerosis. A minority (about 20%) of intracerebral haemorrhages are caused by macrovascular lesions (vascular malformations, aneurysms, cavernomas), venous sinus thrombosis or rarer causes; these are particularly important in young patients (<50 years). Knowledge of vascular and cerebral anatomy is important in localizing strokes and understanding their mechanisms.

The animal data obtained were used by the United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (UN GHS) to define the classification and labelling (C&L) for eye damage/irritation endpoint. However, the Draize test, a method which was never formally validated, has been widely criticized because of its technical limitations. In addition, ethical and economic issues and advances in scientific knowledge, and political and public pressures have made animal experimentation unsustainable. This scenario has consequently led to the development of nonanimal testing and protocols/approaches with considerable predictive value and relevance for humans. It is widely accepted that one single nonanimal method cannot cover all the criteria of damage/inflammation assessed by regulatory adopted in vivo animal testing. Thus, integrated testing strategies (ITS) have been proposed, including a tiered testing approach combining different nonanimal testing with different endpoints, which have been used for regulatory purposes, on a case-by-case basis and within integrated approaches to testing and assessment (IATA), to identify materials according to their ability to trigger eye damage. In particular, the top-down and bottom-up approaches have been recommended for the C&L of materials, which cause serious eye damage or eye irritation, respectively. This chapter describes detailed protocols for eye irritation testing based on cells (Short Time Exposure-STE, OECD No. 491/2017), a vascularized membrane (the Hen's Egg Test-Chorioallantoic Membrane-HET-CAM) and corneal tissue (Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability-BCOP, OECD No. 437/2017), which can be applied using top-down or bottom-up approaches. In addition, it suggests making a corneal histomorphometric evaluation as an additional parameter in the BCOP method to differentiate materials that cause serious eye tissue damage (UN GHS Cat. 1) from materials that have reversible eye irritation effects (UN GHS Cat. 2).","Valadares, Marize Campos; de Oliveira, Gisele Augusto Rodrigues; de Ávila, Renato Ivan; da Silva, Artur Christian Garcia",Methods Mol Biol,545,1

However, existing rule-based approaches require tedious manual specifications of visualization rules by visualization experts. Other machine learning-based approaches often work like black-box and are difficult to understand why a specific visualization is recommended, limiting the wider adoption of these approaches. This paper fills the gap by presenting KG4Vis, a knowledge graph (KG)-based approach for visualization recommendation. It does not require manual specifications of visualization rules and can also guarantee good explainability. Specifically, we propose a framework for building knowledge graphs, consisting of three types of entities (i.e., data features, data columns and visualization design choices) and the relations between them, to model the mapping rules between data and effective visualizations. A TransE-based embedding technique is employed to learn the embeddings of both entities and relations of the knowledge graph from existing dataset-visualization pairs. Such embeddings intrinsically model the desirable visualization rules. Then, given a new dataset, effective visualizations can be inferred from the knowledge graph with semantically meaningful rules. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the proposed approach, including quantitative comparisons, case studies and expert interviews. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","Li, Haotian; Wang, Yong; Zhang, Songheng; Song, Yangqiu; Qu, Huamin",,545,27

The most contagious form of COVID-19 associated with ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 majorly produces the cytokine storm and severe lung inflammation and ultimately leads to respiratory failure. ARDS is a complex disease and there is no proper therapeutics for effective therapy. Still, there is a huge scope to identify novel targets to combat respiratory illness. In the current study, we have identified the epigenetic regulating protein BRD4 and developed siRNA based nanomedicine to treat the ARDS. The liposomes were prepared by thin-film hydration method, where BRD4 siRNA complexed with cationic lipid and exhibited 96.24 ± 18.01 nm size and stable even in the presence of RNase. BRD4 siRNA lipoplexes (BRD4-siRNA-LP) inhibited inflammatory cells in lungs and suppressed the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced the neutrophil infiltration and mast cell accumulation. Also, BRD4 siRNA based nanomedicine significantly reduced the LPS induced cytokine storm followed by inflammatory signaling pathways. Interestingly, BRD4-siRNA-LP suppressed the LPS-induced p65 and STAT3 nuclear translocation and ameliorated the lung inflammation. Thus, BRD4-siRNA-LP could be a plausible therapeutic option for treating ARDS and might be useful for combating the COVID-19 associated respiratory illness.","Pooladanda, Venkatesh; Thatikonda, Sowjanya; Muvvala, Sai Priya; Devabattula, Geetanjali; Godugu, Chandraiah",Int J Pharm,545,16

Our analysis reveals that using random forest (RF) classifier, general PPI Modulators independent of PPI family can be predicted with ROC-AUC higher than 0.9, when training and test sets are generated by random split. The performance of the classifier on data sets very different from those used in training has also been estimated by using different state of the art protocols for removing various types of bias in division of data into training and test sets. The family-specific PPIM predictors developed in this work for 11 clinically important PPI families also have prediction accuracies of above 90% in majority of the cases.

Nonetheless, we predicted that a major EV-D68 outbreak, and hence an AFM outbreak, would have still been possible in 2020 under normal epidemiological conditions.

It is unclear whether it can be shed into human milk and transmitted to a child via breastfeeding. We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human milk samples of 15 mothers with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and in the throat swab samples of their infants. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study in which breast milk samples were collected from 15 mothers with COVID-19. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the whole human milk samples of the patients was investigated using RT-qPCR. All of the infants underwent a clinical follow-up during their 14-day isolation and their throat swab samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Of 15 mothers with COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in milk samples from 4 mothers. The throat swab samples from these mothers' infants were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Three of the four mothers were breastfeeding. In addition, during the 14-day isolation, all but three of the mothers breastfed their infants. Of the 12 breastfed infants, while the test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swab samples was negative in 6 of the infants, the other 6 infants, who had mild COVID-19 symptoms, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Clinical outcomes of all mothers and infants were uneventful. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case series with the largest number of cases with SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity in human milk samples of mothers with COVID-19. However, we believe that the benefits of breastfeeding may outweigh the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants.","Kilic, Talat; Kilic, Sebnem; Berber, Nurcan Kirici; Gunduz, Ayten; Ersoy, Yasemin",Int J Clin Pract,545,5

The aim of this project is to develop and test a secure and reliable computerized decision support system (CDSS) in web-app and evaluate its use, usability and its outputs in a pre-specified way. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team was recruited to plan and design, based on the SMASS medical CDSS, the scenarios of the COVID-Guide web-app, a self-triage system for patients with suspected covid-19. The output data for the period May-September 2020 from Germany were analyzed. RESULTS: During the period under review, the total number of consultations in Germany was 96,012. 3,415 (3.56%) consultations indicated the need for immediate evaluation, by activating the emergency service (calling an ambulance) - 1,942, equal to 2.02% - or by advising the patient to go to hospital - 1,743, equal to 1.54%.

The output data for the period May-September 2020 from Germany were analyzed. RESULTS: During the period under review, the total number of consultations in Germany was 96,012. 3,415 (3.56%) consultations indicated the need for immediate evaluation, by activating the emergency service (calling an ambulance) - 1,942, equal to 2.02% - or by advising the patient to go to hospital - 1,743, equal to 1.54%. CONCLUSIONS: Data seems to show good usability and a consistent number of consultations carried out. Regular use of COVID-Guide could help collect epidemiological data on the spread of (suspected) covid-19 cases, easily and quickly available in all countries where the tool will be used. Using the SSDC could help reduce the load on operators. Furthermore, the use of anonymous and geolocatable clinical data together with the generation of alerts and indicators produced by COVID-Guide could become a useful tool for epidemiological surveillance in the future phases of the pandemic (Telemedical Syndromic Surveillance).","Demurtas, Jacopo; Tonelli, Roberto; Celotto, Stefano; Veronese, Nicola; Lagolio, Erik; Rossi, Francesca; Clini, Enrico; Righi, Elena; Meer, Andreas",Recenti Prog Med,545,25

However, other organs might also be involved. Acute kidney injury has been reported as a complication with high variability and controversial results. We aimed to define the frequency of AKI as well as two specific renal biomarkers including BUN and serum Cr among individuals suffering from COVID-19 infection. We investigated Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases until 16th April 2020 and included all relevant peer-reviewed published studies without any language limitations. We further categorized patients according to their clinical status into severe, non-severe, and death groups. 18 records on 4528 individuals were assessed. The mean age of individuals were 52.5 ± 24.4 years (males: 55.6%). Prevalence of AKI was 4% (95% CI: 2% to 8%) and was significantly lower among non-severe patients in comparison to deceased ones (1%, 95% CI: 0% to 4%, vs. 31%, 95% CI: 19% to 47%). BUN mean was 5.14 mmol/L (95% CI: 4.60 to 5.69). Non-severe patients had remarkably lower means of BUN compared to deceased or those with severe infection (4.25 mmol/L, 95% Cl: 3.70 to 4.79, vs. 8.9 mmol/L, 95% CI: 7.94 to 9.86, vs. 6.63 mmol/L, 95% Cl: 5.62 to 7.65; respectively). The mean serum Cr was 71.60 mmol/L (95% Cl: 67.56 to 75.64). Our findings suggest that COVID-19 does not seem to involve renal system extensively and other possible mechanisms might be further investigated in this regard.","Vakhshoori, Mehrbod; Emami, Sayed Ali; Heidarpour, Maryam; Shafie, Davood; Mortazavi, Mojgan",Iran J Kidney Dis,545,22

Frail and older people are at the highest risk of mortality. The main objective of the present research was to quantify the impact of clinical frailty scale (CFS) by increasing severity of frailty and to identify other personal prognostic factors associated with increased mortality from COVID-19. Methods This study offers a contemporary systematic review and meta-analysis to analyse the stratified mortality risk by increasing CFS sub-categories (1–3, 4–5 and 6–9). Databases searched included EMBASE, MEDLINE, CAB Abstracts, PsychInfo, and Web of Science with end-search restriction the 18th December 2020. Publications identified via MedRevix were followed up on the 23rd March 2021 in peer-reviewed database search, and citations were updated as published. Prospective and retrospective cohort studies which reported the association between CFS and COVID-19 mortality were included. Thirty-four studies were eligible for systematic review and seventeen for meta-analysis, with 81–87% (I2) heterogeneity. Findings All studies [N: 34] included patients from a hospital setting, comprising a total of 18,042 patients with mean age 72.8 (Min: 56;Max: 86). The CFS 4–5 patient group had significantly increased mortality when compared to patients with CFS 1–3 [(RE) OR 1.95 (1.32 (95% CI), 2.87 (95% CI));I2 81%;p = 0.0008]. Furthermore, CFS 6–9 patient group displayed an even more noticeable mortality increase when compared to patients with CFS 1–3 [(RE) OR 3.09 (2.03, 4.71);I2 87%;p&lt;0.0001]. Generic inverse variance analysis of adjusted hazard ratio among included studies highlighted that CFS (p = 0.0001), male gender (p = 0.0009), National Early Warning Score (p = 0.0001), Ischaemic Heart Disease (IHD) (p = 0.07), Hypertension (HT) (p&lt;0.0001), and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (p = 0.0009) were associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. Interpretation Our findings suggest a differential stratification of CFS scores in the context of COVID-19 infection, in which CFS 1–3 patients may be considered at lower risk, CFS 4–5 at moderate risk, and CFS 6–9 at high risk of mortality regardless of age. Overall, our study not only aims to alert clinicians of the value of CFS scores, but also highlight the multiple dimensions to consider such as age, gender and co-morbidities, even among moderately frail patients in relation to COVID-19 mortality.

Our primary objective was to identify valid seroprevalence studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection and compare their estimates with the reported, and imputed, COVID-19 case rates within the same population at the same time point. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and Europe-PMC for published studies and pre-prints that reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and/or IgA antibodies for serosurveys of the general community from 1 Jan to 12 Aug 2020. RESULTS: Of the 2199 studies identified, 170 were assessed for full text and 17 studies representing 15 regions and 118,297 subjects were includable. The seroprevalence proportions in 8 studies ranged between 1%-10%, with 5 studies under 1%, and 4 over 10%-from the notably hard-hit regions of Gangelt, Germany; Northwest Iran; Buenos Aires, Argentina; and Stockholm, Sweden. For seropositive cases who were not previously identified as COVID-19 cases, the majority had prior COVID-like symptoms. The estimated seroprevalences ranged from 0.56-717 times greater than the number of reported cumulative cases-half of the studies reported greater than 10 times more SARS-CoV-2 infections than the cumulative number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence is well below ""herd immunity"" in all countries studied. The estimated number of infections, however, were much greater than the number of reported cases and deaths in almost all locations. The majority of seropositive people reported prior COVID-like symptoms, suggesting that undertesting of symptomatic people may be causing a substantial under-ascertainment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Byambasuren, Oyungerel; Dobler, Claudia C; Bell, Katy; Rojas, Diana Patricia; Clark, Justin; McLaws, Mary-Louise; Glasziou, Paul",PLoS One,545,26

The extensive scope of disruption, massive spillover of effects across countries and industries, and extreme shifts in demand and supply that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrate that pandemics are qualitatively different from typical disruptions. As such, pandemics require scholars to take a fresh look at what lenses offer understanding of supply chain phenomena in order to help supply chain managers better prepare for the next pandemic and foster transiliency (i.e., the ability to simultaneously restore some processes and change – often radically – others). To help scholars and managers achieve these aims, we offer an agenda for supply chain management research on pandemics by considering how the key tenets of well-known and emergent theories can illuminate challenges and potential solutions. Specifically, we consider how resource dependence theory, institutional theory, resource orchestration theory, structural inertia, game theory, real options theory, event systems theory, awareness-motivation-capability framework, prospect theory, and tournament theory offer ideas that can help scholars build knowledge about pandemics’ effects on supply chains as well as help managers formulate responses.

One of the areas negatively impacted is the education system. The country's over reliance on traditional face-to-face teaching has brought about serious challenges to policymakers who have to decide how learning would proceed in the absence of physical contact between the teacher and the learner. This has been exacerbated by the general lack of access to textbooks and other teaching and learning materials which makes it difficult for parents to assist with home schooling. The potential use of mobile apps to support and enhance early childhood learning has received little attention in developing countries such as Zimbabwe, yet its impact in supporting early childhood education would be enormous during and post the COVID-19 pandemic. The study seeks to develop a numeracy-based app prototype that uses a local language (IsiNdebele) in a classroom or home-based schooling in response to the COVID19 pandemic or other natural disasters or man-made situations that may make face-to-face interaction impossible. The analysis showed that kindergarten teachers had positive opinion towards the app as they perceived the prototype to be useful, easy to use, simple and that learners would be eager to use it.

We designed the present longitudinal study to evaluate the psychological impact of quarantine in Italian community-dwelling adult participants. METHODS: A sample of 304 Italian community-dwelling adult participants (75.7% female; mean age = 35.28 years) was administered self-reported measures of depression, anxiety and acute stress symptoms at the beginning and at the end of the lockdown. Potential predictors of clinically relevant symptoms at the end of the lockdown were assessed. Specifically, data on gender, civil status, education level, occupation, and area of residence, as well as maladaptive personality domains were collected. RESULTS: More than 43% of participants suffered from the early impact of the lockdown; at the end of the lockdown roughly 32% of participants still reported any clinically relevant depression anxiety, and/or acute stress disorder condition. Clinically relevant acute stress reaction at the beginning of lockdown was a particularly important risk factor for experiencing clinically relevant acute stress, depression, and anxiety at the end of the lockdown. Maladaptive personality domains represent non-trivial predictors of participants' self-reports of clinically relevant depression, anxiety, and acute stress conditions at the end of the lockdown. LIMITATIONS: Excess of female participants and the impossibility of evaluating if participants suffered from any internalizing disorder before the COVID-19 quarantine represent major limitations of our study. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest assessment of internalizing disorder symptoms during quarantine may be helpful in identifying people who may benefit from early treatment interventions.","Somma, Antonella; Krueger, Robert F; Markon, Kristian E; Gialdi, Giulia; Colanino, Miriana; Ferlito, Danila; Liotta, Chiara; Frau, Claudia; Fossati, Andrea",J Affect Disord,545,2

OBJECTIVES: Provide a review of the research literature, propose hypotheses, and therapies based on the potential link between testosterone (T) and COVID-19 induced mortality in elderly men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of publications in academic electronic databases, and government and public health organization web sites on T, aging, inflammation, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and COVID-19 disease state and outcomes was performed. RESULTS: The link between T, the immune system, and male aging is well-established, as is the progressive decline in T levels with aging. In women, T levels drop before menopause and variably increase with advanced age. Elevated IL-6 is a characteristic biomarker of patients infected with COVID-19 and has been linked to the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus far, half of the admitted COVID-19 patients developed ARDS, half of these patients died, and elderly male patients have been more likely to develop ARDS and die. Low T is associated with ARDS. These data suggest that low T levels may exacerbate the severity of COVID-19 infection in elderly men. It may also stand to reason that normal T levels may offer some protection against COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, present in high levels in the testis. CONCLUSION: At present, it is not known whether low T levels in aging hypogonadal males create a permissive environment for severe responses to COVID-19 infection or if the virus inhibits androgen formation. Given the preponderance of COVID-19 related mortality in elderly males, additional testing for gonadal function and treatment with T may be merited.","Papadopoulos, Vassilios; Li, Lu; Samplaski, Mary",Androl.

MethodsNationwide survey in February-March 2021 of adults representative across sex, age and location. Vaccine uptake and a range of putative drivers of uptake, including vaccine confidence, socioeconomic status, and sources of trust, were examined using logistic and Bayesian regressions for vaccines generally and for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. ResultsOverall 1,166 surveys were collected from participants aged 18-90 years (mean 52, SD of 19). Seventy-eight percent reported being likely to receive a vaccine against COVID-19. Higher SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intentions were associated with: increasing age (OR: 1.04 95%CI [1.03-1.044]), being male (OR: 1.37, 95% CI [1.08 - 1.72]), residing in the least disadvantaged area quintile (OR: 2.27 95%CI [1.53 - 3.37]) and a self-perceived high risk of getting COVID-19 (OR: 1.52 95% CI [1.08 - 2.14]). However, 72% of participants did not believe that they were at a high risk of getting COVID-19. Findings regarding vaccines in general were similar except there were no sex differences. For both the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and vaccines in general, there were no differences in intentions to vaccinate as a function of education level, perceived income level, and rurality. Knowing that the vaccine is safe and effective, and that getting vaccinated will protect others, trusting the company that made it and getting vaccination recommended by a doctor were reported to influence a large proportion of the study cohort to uptake the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Seventy-eight percent reported the intent to continue engaging in virus-protecting behaviours (mask wearing, social distancing etc.) post-vaccine. ConclusionsSeventy-eight percent of Australians are likely to receive a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Key influencing factors identified in this study (e.g. knowing that the vaccine is safe and effective, getting a doctors recommendation to get vaccinated) can be used to inform public health messaging to enhance vaccination rates.

Controlling fake news in the time of pandemic is a daunting problem that slaps Internet regulation at its face. On the Internet, lies spreads faster than truth and correcting misinformation means tonnes of work. This paper examines Internet self- and co-regulatory approaches in selected jurisdictions to reduce the impact of fake news on governments, industry, and private actors. In applying content analysis as a qualitative research method, the first section analysed specific legislations enacted by parliaments to criminalise the acts of disseminating and publishing fake news.

Symptom overlap between COVID-19 and lung cancer may complicate diagnostic evaluation. We aimed to investigate the incidence, symptoms, differential diagnosis, and outcomes of COVID-19 in lung cancer patients. Methods: To determine an at-risk population for COVID-19, we retrospectively identified lung cancer patients receiving longitudinal care within a single institution in the 12 months (4/1/19 - 3/31/20) immediately preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, including an ""active therapy population"" treated within the last 60 days of this period. Among patients subsequently referred for COVID-19 testing, we compared symptoms, laboratory/radiographic findings, and outcomes of positive versus negative patients. Results: Between 4/1/2019-3/31/2020, 696 patients received longitudinal care, including 406 (58%) in the active therapy population. Among 55 patients referred for COVID-19 testing, 24 (44%) were COVID-19 positive, representing a cumulative incidence of 3.4% (longitudinal population) and 1.5% (active therapy population). Compared to COVID-19-negative patients, COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to have a supplemental oxygen requirement (11% vs. 54%, p=0.005) and to have typical COVID-19 pneumonia imaging findings (5 vs. 56%, p=0.001). Otherwise, there were no significant differences in presenting symptoms. Among COVID-negative patients, alternative etiologies included treatment-related toxicity (26%), atypical pneumonia (22%), and disease progression (22%). Sixteen COVID-19-postive patients (67%) required hospitalization, and 7 (29%) died from COVID-related complications. Conclusions: COVID-19 was infrequent in this lung cancer population, but these patients experienced high rates of morbidity and mortality. Oncologists should maintain a low threshold for COVID-19 testing in lung cancer patients presenting with acute symptoms.","Piper-Vallillo, Andrew J; Mooradian, Meghan J; Meador, Catherine B; Yeap, Beow Y; Peterson, Jennifer; Sakhi, Mustafa; Do, Andrew; Zubiri, Leyre; Stevens, Sara; Vaughn, Jeanne; Goodwin, Kelly; Gavralidis, Alexander; Willers, Henning; Miller, Adam; Farago, Anna; Piotrowska, Zofia; Lin, Jessica J; Dagogo-Jack, Ibiayi; Lennes, Inga T; Sequist, Lecia V; Temel, Jennifer S; Heist, Rebecca S; Digumarthy, Subba; Reynolds, Kerry L; Gainor, Justin F",JTO Clin Res Rep,545,20

Coronaviruses constitute Nidovirales together with Arteriviridae. Most of human coronaviruses are known to cause mild illness and common cold. However, an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in 2002, ten years after SARS epidemic Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged in 2012. Now, we face on a novel coronavirus which emerges in end of 2019. This novel coronavirus is named as SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is spread to worldwide within one to two months and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respiratory illness. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses possessing a positive-sense and large single stranded RNA genomes. The 5' two-thirds of the CoV genome consists of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs 1a and 1b) that encode non-structural proteins (nsps). The other one-third of the genome consists of ORFs encoding structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and accessory proteins. Upon infection of CoV into host cells, the translation of two precursor polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, occurs and these polyproteins are cleaved into 16 nsps by viral proteases. Structural proteins assemble to the vesicles located from ER to Golgi (ER Golgiintermediate compartment) and virions bud into the vesicles. Virions are released from infectedcells via exocytosis.","Kamitani, Wataru",Uirusu,545,12

It is widely accepted that the quality of cryoEM maps varies locally; therefore, the evaluation of the maps-derived structural models must be done locally as well. In this article, a method for the local analysis of the map-to-model fit is presented. The algorithm uses a comparison of two local resolution maps. The first is the local FSC (Fourier shell correlation) between the full map and the model, while the second is calculated between the half maps normally used in typical single particle analysis workflows. We call the quality measure ""FSC-Q"", and it is a quantitative estimation of how much of the model is supported by the signal content of the map. Furthermore, we show that FSC-Q may be helpful to detect overfitting. It can be used to complement other methods, such as the Q-score method that estimates the resolvability of atoms.","Ramírez-Aportela, Erney; Maluenda, David; Fonseca, Yunior C; Conesa, Pablo; Marabini, Roberto; Heymann, J Bernard; Carazo, Jose Maria; Sorzano, Carlos Oscar S",Nat Commun,545,16

CNGOF],15.590692,-0.7079249,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented stress on economies, food systems, and health care resources in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Existing surveillance provides a proxy of the COVID-19 caseload and mortalities; however, these measures make it difficult to identify the dynamics of the pandemic and places where outbreaks are likely to occur. Moreover, existing surveillance techniques have failed to measure the dynamics of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide additional surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission to track changes in the speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence in the transmission of the pandemic more accurately than existing metrics. METHODS: Through a longitudinal trend analysis, we extracted COVID-19 data over 45 days from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to monitor the daily number of cases in the LAC as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. COVID-19 transmission rates were tracked for the LAC between September 30 and October 6, 2020, and between October 7 and 13, 2020. RESULTS: The LAC saw a reduction in the speed, acceleration, and jerk for the week of October 13, 2020, compared to the week of October 6, 2020, accompanied by reductions in new cases and the 7-day moving average. For the week of October 6, 2020, Belize reported the highest acceleration and jerk, at 1.7 and 1.8, respectively, which is particularly concerning, given its high mortality rate. The Bahamas also had a high acceleration at 1.5. In total, 11 countries had a positive acceleration during the week of October 6, 2020, whereas only 6 countries had a positive acceleration for the week of October 13, 2020. The TAC displayed an overall positive trend, with a speed of 10.40, acceleration of 0.27, and jerk of -0.31, all of which decreased in the subsequent week to 9.04, -0.81, and -0.03, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Metrics such as new cases, cumulative cases, deaths, and 7-day moving averages provide a static view of the pandemic but fail to identify where and the speed at which SARS-CoV-2 infects new individuals, the rate of acceleration or deceleration of the pandemic, and weekly comparison of the rate of acceleration of the pandemic indicate impending explosive growth or control of the pandemic. Enhanced surveillance will inform policymakers and leaders in the LAC about COVID-19 outbreaks.","Post, Lori; Ohiomoba, Ramael O; Maras, Ashley; Watts, Sean J; Moss, Charles B; Murphy, Robert Leo; Ison, Michael G; Achenbach, Chad J; Resnick, Danielle; Singh, Lauren Nadya; White, Janine; Chaudhury, Azraa S; Boctor, Michael J; Welch, Sarah B; Oehmke, James Francis",JMIR Public Health Surveill,545,13

The effects of safety measures on neurosurgical training remain unclear. To understand how neurosurgical residents have been affected, we analyzed the operative experience in the months leading up to and during the pandemic. METHODS: The resident and institutional case totals were tallied for a single residency program in Miami-Dade County from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020. A matched cohort analysis was performed before and during the pandemic to assess the effects on resident surgical training. RESULTS: The case totals for all levels of training were lower when restrictions were placed on elective surgeries. An average of 11 cases was logged in April 2020, a decrease from 26 cases in April 2019 (95% confidence interval, 8.7-22; P < 0.01). An average of 20 cases was logged in May 2020, a decrease from 25 cases in May 2019 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-8.8; P = 0.01). In April and May 2020, 299 (66%) and 148 (50%) fewer cases had been performed at our institution compared with April and May 2109. CONCLUSIONS: Operative experience was reduced for residents during the months when the performance of elective cases was restricted. Our data suggest experience in some areas of neurosurgery were more affected than were others, and residents at different levels of training were also affected differently. However, the extent of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on neurosurgical training is unlikely to be understood in the short term.","Burks, Joshua D; Luther, Evan M; Govindarajan, Vaidya; Shah, Ashish H; Levi, Allan D; Komotar, Ricardo J",World neurosurgery (Online),545,16

We constructed a fuel cell with an enzymatic cascade at the anode for efficient energy conversion. The construction involved fabrication of the flow-through cell by three-dimensional printing. Gold nanoparticles with covalently bound naphthoquinone moieties deposited on cellulose/polypyrrole (CPPy) paper allowed us to significantly improve the catalysis rate, both at the anode and cathode of the fuel cell. The enzymatic cascade on the anode consisted of invertase, mutarotase, Flavine Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent glucose dehydrogenase and fructose dehydrogenase. The multi-substrate anode utilized glucose, fructose, sucrose, or a combination of them, as the anode fuel and molecular oxygen were the oxidant at the laccase-based cathode. Laccase was adsorbed on the same type of naphthoquinone modified gold nanoparticles. Interestingly, the naphthoquinone modified gold nanoparticles acted as the enzyme orienting units and not as mediators since the catalyzed oxygen reduction occurred at the potential where direct electron transfer takes place. Thanks to the good catalytic and capacitive properties of the modified electrodes, the power density of the sucrose/oxygen enzymatic fuel cells (EFC) reached 0.81 mW cm-2, which is beneficial for a cell composed of a single cathode and anode.","Kizling, Michal; Dzwonek, Maciej; Nowak, Anna; Tymecki, Lukasz; Stolarczyk, Krzysztof; Wieckowska, Agnieszka; Bilewicz, Renata",,545,1

Here, we uncover the presence of above-bandgap oscillatory features in the absorption spectra of formamidinium lead triiodide thin films. We attribute these discrete features to intrinsically occurring quantum confinement effects, for which the related energies change with temperature according to the inverse square of the intrinsic lattice parameter, and with peak index in a quadratic manner. By determining the threshold film thickness at which the amplitude of the peaks is appreciably decreased, and through ab initio simulations of the absorption features, we estimate the length scale of confinement to be 10-20 nm. Such absorption peaks present a new and intriguing quantum electronic phenomenon in a nominally bulk semiconductor, offering intrinsic nanoscale optoelectronic properties without necessitating cumbersome additional processing steps.","Wright, Adam D; Volonakis, George; Borchert, Juliane; Davies, Christopher L; Giustino, Feliciano; Johnston, Michael B; Herz, Laura M",Nat. materials,545,16

METHODS: Prospective repeated-measures cohort study on a sample of participants aged 60 and over. A total of 2, 785 respondents at the baseline (May 2019) were followed during the COVID-19 (August 2020). The changes in psychological distress before and during the COVID-19 were assessed using generalised estimation equations with adjusting for sex, age, education, economic status, marital status, tea drinking status, smoking status, alcohol drinking status, sedentary time, sleep quality and activities of daily living. RESULTS: The psychological distress of older people has significantly increased in August 2020 compared with May 2019. Both older adults who remained frail and transitioned into frail state reported more psychological distress during the COVID-19. Similarly, both pre-existing multimorbidity and emerging multimorbidity groups were associated with more psychological distress. The group of frailty progression who reported new emerging multimorbidity showed more increase in psychological distress in comparison with those who remained in the non-frail state who reported no multimorbidity. CONCLUSION: Psychological distress has increased among the community-dwelling older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, and sustained and progressive frail states as well as multimorbidity were all associated with a greater increase of psychological distress. These findings suggest that future public health measures should take into account the increased psychological distress among older people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the assessment of frailty and multimorbidity might help in warning of psychological distress.","Wang, Yi; Fu, Peipei; Li, Jie; Jing, Zhengyue; Wang, Qiong; Zhao, Dan; Zhou, Chengchao",Age Ageing,545,29

METHODS: A sample of 1003 parents (73% female, 82% Caucasian 86% in romantic relationships) were recruited as part of a larger study on the COVID-19 pandemic and family functioning from Mach 27th to the end of April 2020, the height of the United States' ""first wave."" Participants completed measures of psychological flexibility (the Multidimensional Psychological Flexibility inventory; MPFI), interpersonal constructs (perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness), desire for death, COVID-19 related stressors (resource strain and loss due to COVID-19). RESULTS: Moderated-mediation path models highlighted a significant indirect association between COVID-19 stressors and desire for death mediated by perceived burdensomeness to others. This indirect pathway was moderated by psychological inflexibility such that links were strongest at high levels of inflexibility and weak or non-significant at low levels of inflexibility. Results were generally consistent across five of the six facets of inflexibility. DISCUSSION: The findings highlight the value of targeting psychological inflexibility as an important strategy to reduce suicide risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implications of patterns of results across different facets for treatment approach are discussed.","Crasta, Dev; Daks, Jennifer S; Rogge, Ronald D",J Contextual Behav Sci,545,25

In this contributed paper, we show that polarization effects due to such dielectric mismatch remarkably influence the double-layer structure of a polyelectrolyte solution confined between two charged surfaces. Surprisingly, the electrostatic potential across the adsorbed polyelectrolyte double layer at the confining surface is found to decrease with increasing surface charge density, indicative of a negative differential capacitance. Furthermore, in the presence of polarization effects, the electrostatic energy stored in the double-layer structure is enhanced with an increase in the charge amplification, which is the absorption of ions on a like-charged surface. We also find that all of the important double-layer properties, such as charge amplification, energy storage, and differential capacitance, strongly depend on the polyelectrolyte backbone flexibility and the solvent quality. These interesting behaviors are attributed to the interplay between the conformational entropy of the confined polyelectrolytes, the Coulombic interaction between the charged species, and the repulsion from the surfaces with lower dielectric constant.","Bagchi, Debarshee; Nguyen, Trung Dac; Olvera de la Cruz, Monica",Proc.

With no vaccines or effective antiviral treatments available, the quest for novel therapeutic solutions remains an urgent priority. Rocaglates, a class of plant-derived cyclopenta[b]benzofurans, exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple RNA viruses including coronaviruses. Specifically, rocaglates inhibit eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A)-dependent mRNA translation initiation, resulting in strongly reduced viral RNA translation. Here, we assessed the antiviral activity of the synthetic rocaglate CR-31-B (-) against SARS-CoV-2 using both in vitro and ex vivo cell culture models. In Vero E6 cells, CR-31-B (-) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication with an EC50 of ~1.8 nM. In primary human airway epithelial cells, CR-31-B (-) reduced viral titers to undetectable levels at a concentration of 100 nM. Reduced virus reproduction was accompanied by substantially reduced viral protein accumulation and replication/transcription complex formation. The data reveal a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity by CR-31-B (-), corroborating previous results obtained for other coronaviruses and supporting the idea that rocaglates may be used in first-line antiviral intervention strategies against novel and emerging RNA virus outbreaks.","Müller, Christin; Obermann, Wiebke; Karl, Nadja; Wendel, Hans-Guido; Taroncher-Oldenburg, Gaspar; Pleschka, Stephan; Hartmann, Roland K; Grünweller, Arnold; Ziebuhr, John",Antiviral Res,545,5

In this work we propose an AI-powered pipeline, based on the deep-learning paradigm, for automated COVID-19 detection and lesion categorization from CT scans. We first propose a new segmentation module aimed at automatically identifying lung parenchyma and lobes. Next, we combine the segmentation network with classification networks for COVID-19 identification and lesion categorization. We compare the model’s classification results with those obtained by three expert radiologists on a dataset of 166 CT scans. Results showed a sensitivity of 90.3% and a specificity of 93.5% for COVID-19 detection, at least on par with those yielded by the expert radiologists, and an average lesion categorization accuracy of about 84%. Moreover, a significant role is played by prior lung and lobe segmentation, that allowed us to enhance classification performance by over 6 percent points. The interpretation of the trained AI models reveals that the most significant areas for supporting the decision on COVID-19 identification are consistent with the lesions clinically associated to the virus, i.e., crazy paving, consolidation and ground glass. This means that the artificial models are able to discriminate a positive patient from a negative one (both controls and patients with interstitial pneumonia tested negative to COVID) by evaluating the presence of those lesions into CT scans. Finally, the AI models are integrated into a user-friendly GUI to support AI explainability for radiologists, which is publicly available at http://perceivelab.com/covid-ai. The whole AI system is unique since, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first AI-based software, publicly available, that attempts to explain to radiologists what information is used by AI methods for making decisions and that proactively involves them in the decision loop to further improve the COVID-19 understanding.","Pennisi, Matteo Kavasidis Isaak Spampinato Concetto Schinina Vincenzo Palazzo Simone Salanitri Federica Proietto Bellitto Giovanni Rundo Francesco Aldinucci Marco Cristofaro Massimo Campioni Paolo Pianura Elisa Di Stefano Federica Petrone Ada Albarello Fabrizio Ippolito Giuseppe Cuzzocrea Salvatore Conoci Sabrina",Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,545,20

The executive branch of the government declared a state of emergency in the Republic of Serbia in March 2020. At the same time the so-called Crisis Headquarter was established with the authority to impose measures of criminal-legal nature. During the two-month state of emergency, through the Crisis Headquarter, the executive branch of the government was changing criminal laws and sanctions at an almost daily basis. It is debatable whether such laws meet the rule of law and the European Court of Human Rights standards. Many citizens failed to adapt their behavior to the imposed measures. On the one hand, the courts have fallen into the trap of double punishment, both for a crime and for a misdemeanor. On the other hand, justifications of the courts' decisions are also questionable, especially those containing references to statements made by members of the crisis team through the media. Furthermore, the Constitutional Court didn't rule on any of the numerous requests for constitutional review, but in September it came out with the view that since the state of emergency was over, its decision was unnecessary. The paper is comprised of several units. In the first place, the author explains the process of legal changes by analyzing all the laws and rules that were passed by the end of2020, as well as data related to the punishment of residents whose behavior was not in accordance with existing legal solutions. Bearing in mind the standards of the rule of law and the European Court of Human Rights, the author then explains that the measures implemented by the Serbian authorities do not meet the basic required criteria, primarily the foreseeability of the law, as well as that the laws were abused for the purpose of the election campaign. The special attention is paid to curfews and the complete ban on leaving homes for senior citizens well as ban of contacting with the family members, and then the lockdown of the rest of the population. The actions taken by the authorities during the epidemic resulted in violation of human rights of their citizens, and experience shows that the only court that citizens will be able to turn to will be the European Court of Human Rights. The author believes that with this understanding of the law and respect for its own citizens, the European Union can only be a distant idea.","Turanjanin, Veljko PhD Assistant Professor",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,545,22

Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been largely adopted in the clinical setting for the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, their known retinal toxicity has raised some safety concerns, especially considering the higher-dosage employed for COVID-19 patients as compared with their suggested posology for their usual indications, including systemic lupus erythematosus and other rheumatic diseases. In this review, we will discuss the optimal dosages recommended for COVID-19 patients when treated with HCQ and CQ. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase and Scopus, by using the following search terms: ""chloroquine retinal toxicity"" and ""hydroxychloroquine retinal toxicity"" alone or in combination with ""coronavirus"", ""COVID-19"", "" SARS-CoV-2 infection "" from inception to August 2020. RESULTS: Although there is still no consistent evidence about HCQ/CQ retinal toxicity in patients with COVID-19, these possible drug-related retinal adverse events may represent a major safety concern. For this reason, appropriate screening strategies, including telemedicine, should be developed in the near future. CONCLUSION: A possible future clinical perspective for patients with COVID-19 treated with HCQ/CQ could reside in the multidisciplinary collaboration between ophthalmologists monitoring the risk of HCQ/CQ-related retinal toxicity and those physicians treating COVID-19 infection.","Nicolò, Massimo; Ferro Desideri, Lorenzo; Bassetti, Matteo; Traverso, Carlo Enrico",Int. ophthalmol,545,24

It is the only top ten cause of death that cannot be prevented, cured or substantially slowed, leaving disease management, caregiver support and service innovation as the main targets for reduction of disease burden. Institutionalization of persons with dementia is common in western countries, despite patients preferring to live longer at home, supported by caregivers. Such complex health challenges warrant multicomponent interventions thoroughly implemented in daily clinical practice. This article describes the rationale, development, feasibility testing and implementation process of the LIVE@Home.Path trial. METHODS: The LIVE@Home.Path trial is a 2-year, multicenter, mixed-method, stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial, aiming to include 315 dyads of home-dwelling people with dementia and their caregivers, recruited from 3 municipalities in Norway. The stepped-wedge randomization implies that all dyads receive the intervention, but the timing is determined by randomization. The control group constitutes the dyads waiting for the intervention. The multicomponent intervention was developed in collaboration with user-representatives, researchers and stakeholders to meet the requirements from the national Dementia Plan 2020. During the 6-month intervention period, the participants will be allocated to a municipal coordinator, the core feature of the intervention, responsible for regular contact with the dyads to facilitate L: Learning, I: Innovation, V: Volunteering and E: Empowerment (LIVE). The primary outcome is resource utilization. This is measured by the Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD) instrument and the Relative Stress Scale (RSS), reflecting that resource utilization is more than the actual time required for caring but also how burdensome the task is experienced by the caregiver. DISCUSSION: We expect the implementation of LIVE to lead to a pathway for dementia treatment and care which is cost-effective, compared to treatment as usual, and will support high-quality independent living, at home.

This current review provides insights on how individuals, communities, and specific populations, such as healthcare workers and patients are leveraging pre-COVID-19 and peri-COVID-19 factors to reinforce their psychological resilience during the global public health crisis. RECENT FINDINGS: Examination of the extant literature indicated that populations around the world rely often on support from their loved-ones, closed significant others, outdoor and physical activities, and spirituality to cope with the COVID-19-related distress. Increased sense of meaning/purpose since the COVID-19 pandemic was also reported. SUMMARY: A portion of publications provided intervention models to reinforce resilience among specific populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, it is not convincing that some of these models can be applied universally.

Thus, female predisposition to pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is an inevitable topic. To better understand the nature of sexual differentiation in the pulmonary circulation, and how heritable factors, in vivo- and/or in vitro-altered estrogen circumstances and changes in the live environment work in concert to discern the sex bias, this chapter reviews pulmonary events characterized by sex-different features, concomitant with exploration of how alterations of genetic expression and estrogen metabolisms trigger the female-predominant pathological signaling. We address the following: PAH (Sect.7.2) is characterized as an estrogenic promotion of its incidence (Sect. 7.2.2), as a function of specific germline mutations, and as an estrogen-elicited protection of its prognosis (Sect.7.2.1). More detail is provided to introduce a less recognized gene of Ephx2 that encodes soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to degrade epoxyeicosatrienic acids (EETs). As a susceptible target of estrogen, Ephx2/sEH expression is downregulated by an estrogen-dependent epigenetic mechanism. Increases in pulmonary EETs then evoke a potentiation of PAH generation, but mitigation of its progression, a phenomenon similar to the estrogen-paradox regulation of PAH. Additionally, the female susceptibility to chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (Sect. 7.3) and asthma (Sect.7.4), but less preference to COVID-19 (Sect. 7.5), and roles of estrogen in their pathogeneses are briefly discussed.","Huang, An; Kandhi, Sharath; Sun, Dong",Adv Exp Med Biol,545,19

Methods: Participants were recruited by social media through WeChat and 6 049 Chinese (aged from 17 to 63 years; median=24) from 31 provinces were included in the study. PTS symptoms, expressive suppression, and cognitive reappraisal were assessed after the outbreak of COVID-19. A regression mixture analysis was conducted in Mplus 7. Results: A regression mixture model identified three latent classes that were primarily distinguished by differential effects of COVID- 19 exposures on PTS symptoms: (1) Class 1 (mildly PTS symptoms, 80.9%), (2) Class 2 (moderate PTS symptoms, 13.0%), and (3) Class 3 (high PTS symptoms, 6.1%). The results demonstrated that the young, women and people with responsibilities and concerns for others were more vulnerable to PTS symptoms; and they had more expression inhibition and less cognitive reappraisal in three latent classes. Conclusions: The findings suggest that more attention needs to be paid to vulnerable groups such as the young, women and people with responsibilities and concerns for others. Therapies to encourage emotional expression and increase cognitive reappraisal may also be helpful for trauma survivors.","Jiang, Hong-Juan; Nan, Jiang; Lv, Zhi-Yue; Yang, Juan",Asian Pac. J. Trop.

DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: Nationwide healthcare registers in Denmark and Norway. PARTICIPANTS: All people aged 18-65 years who received a first vaccination with ChAdOx1-S from 9 February 2021 to 11 March 2021. The general populations of Denmark (2016-18) and Norway (2018-19) served as comparator cohorts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Observed 28 day rates of hospital contacts for incident arterial events, venous thromboembolism, thrombocytopenia/coagulation disorders, and bleeding among vaccinated people compared with expected rates, based on national age and sex specific background rates from the general populations of the two countries. RESULTS: The vaccinated cohorts comprised 148 792 people in Denmark (median age 45 years, 80% women) and 132 472 in Norway (median age 44 years, 78% women), who received their first dose of ChAdOx1-S. Among 281 264 people who received ChAdOx1-S, the standardised morbidity ratio for arterial events was 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.20). 59 venous thromboembolic events were observed in the vaccinated cohort compared with 30 expected based on the incidence rates in the general population, corresponding to a standardised morbidity ratio of 1.97 (1.50 to 2.54) and 11 (5.6 to 17.0) excess events per 100 000 vaccinations. A higher than expected rate of cerebral venous thrombosis was observed: standardised morbidity ratio 20.25 (8.14 to 41.73); an excess of 2.5 (0.9 to 5.2) events per 100 000 vaccinations. The standardised morbidity ratio for any thrombocytopenia/coagulation disorders was 1.52 (0.97 to 2.25) and for any bleeding was 1.23 (0.97 to 1.55). 15 deaths were observed in the vaccine cohort compared with 44 expected. CONCLUSIONS: Among recipients of ChAdOx1-S, increased rates of venous thromboembolic events, including cerebral venous thrombosis, were observed. For the remaining safety outcomes, results were largely reassuring, with slightly higher rates of thrombocytopenia/coagulation disorders and bleeding, which could be influenced by increased surveillance of vaccine recipients. The absolute risks of venous thromboembolic events were, however, small, and the findings should be interpreted in the light of the proven beneficial effects of the vaccine, the context of the given country, and the limitations to the generalisability of the study findings.","Pottegård, Anton; Lund, Lars Christian; Karlstad, Øystein; Dahl, Jesper; Andersen, Morten; Hallas, Jesper; Lidegaard, Øjvind; Tapia, German; Gulseth, Hanne Løvdal; Ruiz, Paz Lopez-Doriga; Watle, Sara Viksmoen; Mikkelsen, Anders Pretzmann; Pedersen, Lars; Sørensen, Henrik Toft; Thomsen, Reimar Wernich; Hviid, Anders",BMJ,545,20

The high burden of interventions requiring regular in person and onsite visits for treatment are less feasible. Attention bias modification training (ABMT) is effective for anxiety reduction in adult and adolescent populations. We tested the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of ABMT delivered through a mobile gamified version as a digital emotional health tool for patients with POMS. Methods: Participants with POMS were consecutively recruited from the NYU Langone Pediatric MS Care Center and enrolled to complete a 1-month intervention with use of the Personal Zen ABMT app on their mobile personal device. Feasibility was evaluated by use of the 1-month intervention and efficacy was measured by changes in depression, anxiety, and affect. Results: A total n = 35 patients with POMS were enrolled in the study (M(age) = 17.7, SD = 2.2 years, range 14–23). Feasibility criteria were met with 74% completing the full intervention time, and 100% of the sample completing at least 50% of targeted intervention use. Initial efficacy was found for a reduction in negative affect from baseline to intervention end [M = 22.88, SD = 9.95 vs. M = 19.56, SD = 7.37; t((33)) = 2.47, p = 0.019]. Anxiety also significantly decreased from pre to post-intervention in adults [M = 11.82, SD = 9.90 vs. M = 7.29, SD = 7.17; t((16)) = 3.88, p = 0.001] and youth [M = 51.14, SD = 19.66 vs. M = 40.86, SD = 27.48; t((13)) = 3.17, p = 0.007]. Conclusion: Mobile ABMT with the Personal Zen app is a feasible and accessible digital emotional health tool for patients with POMS and may have broader application for managing distress across chronic neurological conditions.","Charvet, Leigh; George, Allan; Cho, Hyein; Krupp, Lauren B.; Dennis-Tiwary, Tracy A.",Front Neurol,545,16

But the predictive biomarkers for characterizing the variability are still lacking. Since emerging evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) are functionally involved in a number of pathological processes, we hypothesize that these extracellular components may be key determinants and/or predictors of COVID‐19 severity. To test our hypothesis, we collected serum samples from 31 patients with mild COVID‐19 symptoms at the time of their admission for discovery cohort. After symptomatic treatment without corticosteroids, 9 of the 31 patients developed severe/critical COVID‐19 symptoms. We analyzed EV protein and exRNA profiles to look for correlations between these profiles and COVID‐19 severity. Strikingly, we identified three distinct groups of markers (antiviral response‐related EV proteins, coagulation‐related markers, and liver damage‐related exRNAs) with the potential to serve as early predictive biomarkers for COVID‐19 severity. As the best predictive marker, EV COPB2 protein, a subunit of the Golgi coatomer complex, exhibited significantly higher abundance in patients remained mild than developed severe/critical COVID‐19 and healthy controls in discovery cohort (AUC 1.00 (95% CI: 1.00‐1.00)). The validation set included 40 COVID‐19 patients and 39 healthy controls, and showed exactly the same trend between the three groups with excellent predictive value (AUC 0.85 (95% CI: 0.73‐0.97)). These findings highlight the potential of EV COPB2 expression for patient stratification and for making early clinical decisions about strategies for COVID‐19 therapy.","Fujita, Yu; Hoshina, Tokio; Matsuzaki, Juntaro; Yoshioka, Yusuke; Kadota, Tsukasa; Hosaka, Yusuke; Fujimoto, Shota; Kawamoto, Hironori; Watanabe, Naoaki; Sawaki, Kenji; Sakamoto, Yohei; Miyajima, Makiko; Lee, Kwangyole; Nakaharai, Kazuhiko; Horino, Tetsuya; Nakagawa, Ryo; Araya, Jun; Miyato, Mitsuru; Yoshida, Masaki; Kuwano, Kazuyoshi; Ochiya, Takahiro",J Extracell Vesicles,545,20

The European Union (EU) has developed what remains largely contractual and decentralized international procurement cooperation. The corona crisis has broadened and deepened public debate on such cooperation, in particular on the scope of cooperation, solidarity in the allocation of such cooperation, and delegation of cooperative decision-making. Crucial to political debate about these issues are public attitudes that constrain and undergird international cooperation. METHODS: Our survey includes a randomized survey experiment (conjoint analysis) on a representative sample in five European countries in March 2020, informed by legal and policy debate on medical cooperation. Respondents choose and rate policy packages containing randomized mixes of policy attributes with respect to the scope of medicines covered, the solidarity in conferring priority access and the level of delegation. RESULTS: In all country populations surveyed, the experiment reveals considerable popular support for European cooperation. Significant majorities preferred cooperation packages with greater rather than less scope of medicines regulated; with priority given to most in-need countries; and with delegation to EU-level rather than national expertise. CONCLUSION: Joint procurement raises delicate questions with regard to its scope, the inclusion of cross-border solidarity and the delegation of decision-making, that explain reluctance toward joint procurement among political decision-makers. This research shows that there is considerable public support across different countries in favor of centralization, i.e. a large scope and solidarity in the allocation and delegation of decision-making.","Beetsma, Roel; Burgoon, Brian; Nicoli, Francesco; de Ruijter, Anniek; Vandenbroucke, Frank",Eur J Public Health,545,2

Although the majority of infected people experience mild disease, some patients develop a serious disease, especially when other pathologies concur. For this reason, it would be very convenient to find pharmacological and immunological mechanisms that help control SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since the COVID-19 and BCoV viruses are very close phylogenetically, different studies demonstrate the existence of cross-immunity as they retain shared epitopes in their structure. As a possible control measure against COVID-19, we propose the use of cow’s milk immune to BCoV. Thus, the antigenic recognition of some highly conserved structures of viral proteins, particularly M and S2, by anti-BCoV antibodies present in milk would cause a total or partial inactivation of SARS-COV-2 (acting as a particular vaccine) and be addressed more easily by GALT’s highly specialized antigen-presenting cells, thus helping the specific immune response.","Arenas, Antonio; Borge, Carmen; Carbonero, Alfonso; Garcia-Bocanegra, Ignacio; Cano-Terriza, David; Caballero, Javier; Arenas-Montes, Antonio",Front Immunol,545,23

Incorporating ETI into the standard of care creates new motivation and opportunity to consider reductions in overall treatment burden and evaluate whether other chronic medications can now be safely discontinued without loss of clinical benefit. SIMPLIFY is a master protocol poised to test the impact of discontinuing versus continuing two commonly used chronic therapies in people with CF who are at least 12 years of age or older and stable on ETI therapy. The protocol is composed of two concurrent randomized controlled trials designed to evaluate the independent short-term effects of discontinuing hypertonic saline or dornase alfa, enabling individuals on both therapies to participate in one or both trials. The primary objective for each trial is to determine whether discontinuing treatment is noninferior to continuing treatment after establishment of ETI, as measured by the 6-week absolute change in the percent-predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Developing this study required a balance between ideal study-design principles and feasibility. SIMPLIFY will be the largest multicenter, randomized, controlled medication-withdrawal study in CF.

However, computer simulations can be slow to implement for newly emerging epidemics, delaying rapid exploration of different intervention scenarios, and do not immediately give general insights, for example, to identify the control strategy with a minimal socio-economic cost. Here, we resolve this problem by applying an analytical approximation to a general epidemiological, stochastic, spatially explicit SIR(S) model where the infection is dispersed according to a finite-ranged dispersal kernel. We derive analytical conditions for a pathogen to invade a spatially explicit host population and to become endemic. To derive general insights about the likely impact of optimal control strategies on invasion and persistence: first, we distinguish between ‘spatial' and ‘non-spatial' control measures, based on their impact on the dispersal kernel; second, we quantify the relative impact of control interventions on the epidemic; third, we consider the relative socio-economic cost of control interventions. Overall, our study shows a trade-off between the two types of control interventions and a vaccination strategy. We identify the optimal strategy to control invading and endemic diseases with minimal socio-economic cost across all possible parameter combinations. We also demonstrate the necessary characteristics of exit strategies from control interventions.

While armies are increasingly used to deal with environmental disasters, aside from their traditional role, this paper postulates that the geography of the French and international military engagement can be used to analyse both the institutional strategy of crisis management and the message governments send to their population. Military involvement differs in terms of missions given and of the amount of troops mobilised. It first questions the use of the military in the name of national resilience in the political discourse and the way it displays a symbolic message to the population, before analysing the role of armies in the crisis through the spatiality of their interventions.","Opillard, Florian; Palle, Angélique; Michelis, Léa",Tijdschr Econ Soc Geogr,545,16

OBJECTIVE: To understand the onset, severity, and recovery of sensory changes associated with COVID-19 infection, this study will longitudinally track changes in chemosensory acuity among people with suspected COVID-19 infection using standardized test stimuli that are self-administered over 28 days. METHODS: In a prospective, case-controlled observational study, volunteers will be recruited when they present for COVID-19 screening by respiratory tract polymerase chain reaction test (“swab test”). The volunteers will initially complete a series of questionnaires to record their recent changes in smell and taste ability, followed by a brief standardized smell and taste test. Participants will receive a home-use smell and taste test kit to prospectively complete daily self-assessments of their smell and taste acuity at their place of residence for up to 4 weeks, with all data submitted for collection through web-based software. RESULTS: This study has been approved by the Domain Specific Review Board of the National Healthcare Group, Singapore, and is funded by the Biomedical Research Council Singapore COVID-19 Research Fund. Recruitment began on July 23, 2020, and will continue through to March 31, 2021. As of October 2, 2020, 69 participants had been recruited. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study will be the first to collect longitudinal data on changes to smell and taste sensitivity related to clinically diagnosed COVID-19 infection, confirmed by PCR swab test, in a population-based cohort. The findings will provide temporal insights on the onset, severity, and recovery of sensory changes with COVID-19 infection, the consistency of symptoms, and the frequency of full smell recovery among patients with COVID-19. This self-administered and cost-effective approach has many advantages over self-report questionnaire–based methods and provides a more objective measure of smell and taste changes associated with COVID-19 infection; this will encourage otherwise asymptomatic individuals who are potential spreaders of the virus to self-isolate and seek formal medical diagnosis if they experience a sudden change in sensory acuity. This broadened case finding can potentially help control the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the emergence of clusters of infections.

As the media can provide a powerful channel for conveying stereotypes, the current study aimed to explore how Canadian Francophone older adults and the aging process were depicted by the media during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, and to examine if and how the media discourse contributed to ageist attitudes and behaviors. A content analysis of two French Canadian media op-eds and comment pieces (n = 85) published over the course of the first wave of the pandemic was conducted. Findings reveal that the aging process was mainly associated with words of decline, loss, and vulnerability. More so, older people were quasi-absent if not silent in the media discourse. Older adults were positioned as people to fight for and not as people to fight along with in the face of the pandemic. The findings from this study enhance the understanding of theories and concepts of the Theory of Social Representations and the Stereotype Content Model while outlining the importance of providing older people with a voice and a place in the shaping of public discourse around aging.

Among these, coronavirus is identified as a prime culprit ranging from its involvement in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) to COVID-19. These infections involved in huge healthcare and economic cost incurred globally. Every time, coronavirus improved its infection ability and surprised the medical practitioners and researchers. Currently, COVID-19 is also causing numerous infections and stalled global activities. Global efforts are underway to identify potential viral targets for management of these outbreaks, but significant progress in prevention of these outbreaks is not yet achieved. We explored host–pathogen protein–protein interactions of MERS, SARS and COVID-19, and identified host targets common among all recent coronavirus outbreaks. Further, we tried to understand their potential for management of coronavirus. The common proteins involved in coronavirus host–pathogen interactions indicate their indispensable role in the pathogenesis and therefore targeting these proteins can give strategies to prevent current and future coronavirus outbreaks. Viral variability necessitates development of new therapeutic modalities for every outbreak, in contrast targeting necessary human proteins required by all coronaviruses can provide us a clue to prevent current and future coronavirus outbreaks. We found that targeting FURIN and TMPRSS2 can provide good results due to their common involvement in current and previous outbreaks. We also listed some known molecules against these two targets for their potential drug repurposing evaluation. Although, several recent studies undergoing with targeting these proteins for management of coronavirus, but safety evaluation and risk assessment must be given prime importance while targeting human proteins.","Khan, Abdul Arif; Khan, Zakir",Brief Bioinform,545,28

The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020, necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections. Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations. We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%.

This study aimed to clarify the influencing factors for the anxiety level among the Chinese people during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular focus on the media exposure to different COVID-19 information. METHODS: A total of 4991 respondents were randomly recruited from a national online panel from February 12th, 2020 to February 14th, 2020, a period when the number of COVID-19 cases surpassed 10,000 in a single day, with the total cases in China reaching up to 90,000.

RESULTS: The media exposure to COVID-19 information was differently associated with anxiety. Meanwhile, the anxiety level was found to be high in respondents who personally knew someone infected with COVID-19 or those who living in an area with reported cases. Respondents who perceived more risks also reported a higher level of anxiety.

Here we report the development of a live-cell based assay for evaluating the intracellular function of the critical, highly-conserved CoV2 target, the Main 3C-like protease (Mpro). This assay is based on expression of native wild-type mature CoV2 Mpro, the function of which is quantitatively evaluated in living cells through cleavage of a biosensor leading to loss of fluorescence. Evaluation does not require cell harvesting, allowing for multiple measurements from the same cells facilitating quantification of Mpro inhibition, as well as recovery of function upon removal of inhibitory drugs. The pan-coronavirus Mpro inhibitor, GC376, was utilized in this assay and effective inhibition of intracellular CoV2 Mpro was found to be consistent with levels required to inhibit CoV2 infection of human lung cells. We demonstrate that GC376 is an effective inhibitor of intracellular CoV2 Mpro at low micromolar levels, while other predicted Mpro inhibitors, bepridil and alverine, are not. Results indicate this system can provide a highly effective high-throughput coronavirus Mpro screening system.","Dey-Rao, Rama; Smith, George R.; Timilsina, Uddhav; Falls, Zackary; Samudrala, Ram; Stavrou, Spyridon; Melendy, Thomas",Antiviral Res,545,33

These assays provide rapid results for pharmacological HTS, but the underlying, indirect analytical character of these assays can be linked to high false-positive hit rates. Thus, orthogonal and secondary assays using more biological target-based technologies are indispensable for further compound validation and optimization. Direct assay technologies for transporter proteins are electrophysiology-based, but are also complex, time-consuming, and not well applicable for automated profiling purposes. In contrast to conventional patch clamp systems, solid supported membrane (SSM)-based electrophysiology is a sensitive, membrane-based method for transporter analysis, and current technical developments target the demand for automated, accelerated, and sensitive assays for transporter-directed compound screening. In this study, the suitability of the SSM-based technique for pharmacological compound identification and optimization was evaluated performing cell-free SSM-based measurements with the electrogenic amino acid transporter B0AT1 (SLC6A19). Electrophysiological characterization of leucine-induced currents demonstrated that the observed signals were specific to B0AT1. Moreover, B0AT1-dependent responses were successfully inhibited using an established in-house tool compound. Evaluation of current stability and data reproducibility verified the robustness and reliability of the applied assay. Active compounds from primary screens of large compound libraries were validated, and false-positive hits were identified. These results clearly demonstrate the suitability of the SSM-based technique as a direct electrophysiological method for rapid and automated identification of small molecules that can inhibit B0AT1 activity.","Gerbeth-Kreul, Carolin; Pommereau, Antje; Ruf, Sven; Kane, John L; Kuntzweiler, Theresa; Hessler, Gerhard; Engel, Christian K; Shum, Patrick; Wei, LinLi; Czech, Joerg; Licher, Thomas",SLAS Discov,545,20

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study PARTICIPANTS: 86,123 pairs of color fundus photos and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT) scans collected over 21,232 visits from 8,831 eyes of 5,529 patients with glaucoma or suspects. METHODS: A deep learning convolutional neural network was trained to assess fundus photographs and predict SD OCT global RNFL thickness measurements. The model was then tested on an independent sample of eyes that had longitudinal follow-up with both fundus photos and SD OCT scans. The ability to detect eyes that had statistically significant slopes of SD OCT change was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The repeatability of RNFL thickness predictions was investigated by measurements obtained from multiple photos that had been acquired during the same day. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationship between change in predicted RNFL thickness from photos and change in SD OCT RNFL thickness over time. RESULTS: The test sample consisted of 33,466 pairs of fundus photos and SD OCTs collected over 7,125 visits from 1,147 eyes of 717 subjects. Eyes in the test sample were followed for an average of 5.3 ± 3.3 years, with an average of 6.2 ± 3.8 visits. There was a significant correlation between change over time in predicted and observed RNFL thickness (r = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.70 – 0.80; P < 0.001). RNFL predictions had ROC curve area of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.83 – 0.88) to discriminate progressors from non-progressors. For detecting fast progressors (slope faster than 2μm/year), the ROC curve area was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94 – 0.98) with sensitivity of 97% for 80% specificity, and 85% for 90% specificity. For photos obtained at the same visit, the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.946 (95% CI: 0.940 – 0.952), with coefficient of variation of 3.2% (95% CI: 3.1% - 3.3%). CONCLUSION: A deep learning model was able to obtain objective and quantitative estimates of RNFL thickness that correlated well with SD OCT measurements and could potentially be used to monitor for glaucomatous changes over time.","Medeiros, Felipe A.; Jammal, Alessandro A.; Mariottoni, Eduardo B.",Ophthalmology,545,16

Existing research shows that COVID-19 discourse is highly politicized, with political preferences linked to beliefs and disbeliefs about the virus. As it happens with topics that become politicized, people may fall into echo chambers, which is the idea that one is only presented with information they already agree with, thereby reinforcing one’s confirmation bias. Understanding the relationship between information dissemination and political preference is crucial for effective public health communication. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the extent of polarization and examine the structure of echo chambers related to COVID-19 discourse on Twitter in the United States. METHODS: First, we presented Retweet-BERT, a scalable and highly accurate model for estimating user polarity by leveraging language features and network structures. Then, by analyzing the user polarity predicted by Retweet-BERT, we provided new insights into the characterization of partisan users. RESULTS: We observed that right-leaning users were noticeably more vocal and active in the production and consumption of COVID-19 information. We also found that most of the highly influential users were partisan, which may contribute to further polarization. Importantly, while echo chambers exist in both the right- and left-leaning communities, the right-leaning community was by far more densely connected within their echo chamber and isolated from the rest.

This has led the scientific community to characterize the genome of this virus, including its nucleotide composition. Investigation of the dinucleotide frequency revealed that the proportion of CG dinucleotides (CpG) is highly reduced in the viral genomes. Since CpG dinucleotides is the target site for the host antiviral zinc finger protein, it has been suggested that the reduction in the proportion of CpG is the viral response to escape from the host defense machinery. In the present study, we investigated the time of origin of reduction in the CpG content. Whole genome analyses based on all representative viral genomes of the group Betacoronavirus revealed that the CpG content in the lineage of SARS-CoV-2 has been progressively declining over the past 1213 years. The depletion of CpG was found to occur at neutral—as well as selectively constrained—positions of the viral genomes. ABSTRACT: Recent studies suggested that the fraction of CG dinucleotides (CpG) is severely reduced in the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The CpG deficiency was predicted to be the adaptive response of the virus to evade degradation of the viral RNA by the antiviral zinc finger protein that specifically binds to CpG nucleotides. By comparing all representative genomes belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus, this study examined the potential time of origin of CpG depletion. The results of this investigation revealed a highly significant correlation between the proportions of CpG nucleotide (CpG content) of the betacoronavirus species and their times of divergence from SARS-CoV-2. Species that are distantly related to SARS-CoV-2 had much higher CpG contents than that of SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, closely related species had low CpG contents that are similar to or slightly higher than that of SARS-CoV-2. These results suggest a systematic and continuous reduction in the CpG content in the SARS-CoV-2 lineage that might have started since the Sarbecovirus + Hibecovirus clade separated from Nobecovirus, which was estimated to be 1213 years ago. This depletion was not found to be mediated by the GC contents of the genomes. Our results also showed that the depletion of CpG occurred at neutral positions of the genome as well as those under selection. The latter is evident from the progressive reduction in the proportion of arginine amino acid (coded by CpG dinucleotides) in the SARS-CoV-2 lineage over time. The results of this study suggest that shedding CpG nucleotides from their genome is a continuing process in this viral lineage, potentially to escape from their host defense mechanisms.","Subramanian, Sankar",Biology (Basel),545,5

Preliminary evidence suggests that SCAD patients experience high rates of post-event psychological distress. It is unknown whether psychosocial interventions may reduce the distress burden. Seven SCAD patients (mean age = 53.3 years) completed a CBT-based support group. All seven participants completed measures for anxiety, depression, and cardiac-related quality of life at baseline and post-intervention, and five participants completed measures at 3-month follow-up. Six of 7 participants scored above the clinical threshold on a measure of anxiety at baseline and posttreatment. At follow-up, 3 of 5 participants scored below the clinical threshold. For depression, 3 of 7 reported elevated depressive symptoms at baseline. By follow-up, 1 of 5 endorsed elevated depressive symptoms. This is the first known psychosocial intervention study of patients with SCAD. Anxiety symptoms improved for most patients by follow-up with some patients having improved depressive symptoms. Although the sample size is limited, this pilot study suggests a potential benefit of group psychosocial interventions for SCAD survivors.","Vaca, Kelsey C.; Tremmel, Jennifer A.; Edwards, Katharine S.",J Clin Psychol Med Settings,545,1

Currently, much is unknown about functionally neutralizing human antibody responses and durability to SARS-CoV-2 months after infection or the reason for the discrepancy in COVID-19 disease and sex. Using convalescent-phase sera collected from 101 COVID-19-recovered individuals 21 to 212 days after symptom onset with 48 additional longitudinal samples, we measured functionality and durability of serum antibodies. We also evaluated associations of individual demographic and clinical parameters with functional neutralizing antibody responses to COVID-19. We found robust antibody durability out to 6 months, as well as significant positive associations with the magnitude of the neutralizing antibody response and male sex and in individuals with cardiometabolic comorbidities. IMPORTANCE In this study, we found that neutralizing antibody responses in COVID-19-convalescent individuals vary in magnitude but are durable and correlate well with receptor binding domain (RBD) Ig binding antibody levels compared to other SARS-CoV-2 antigen responses. In our cohort, higher neutralizing antibody titers are independently and significantly associated with male sex compared to female sex. We also show for the first time that higher convalescent antibody titers in male donors are associated with increased age and symptom grade. Furthermore, cardiometabolic comorbidities are associated with higher antibody titers independently of sex. Here, we present an in-depth evaluation of serologic, demographic, and clinical correlates of functional antibody responses and durability to SARS-CoV-2 which supports the growing literature on sex discrepancies regarding COVID-19 disease morbidity and mortality, as well as functional neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.","Markmann, Alena J.; Giallourou, Natasa; Bhowmik, D.

Computational simulations are often used as a basis for forecasting the dynamics of epidemics and, for this purpose, compartmental models have been widely used to assess the situation resulting from the spread of the disease in the population. Reliable data is essential to obtain adequate simulations. However, several political, economic, and social factors have caused inconsistencies in the reported data, which are reflected in the capacity for realistic simulations and predictions. Such uncertainties are mainly motivated by a large-scale underreporting of cases due to the reduced testing capacity in some locations. In order to mitigate the effects of noise in the data used to estimate parameters of compartmental models, we propose strategies capable of improving the ability to predict the spread of the disease. We show that the regularization of data by means of Gaussian Process Regression can reduce the variability of successive forecasts, thus improving predictive ability. We also present the advantages of adopting parameters of compartmental models that vary over time, in detriment to the usual approach with constant values.","Libotte, G. B.; Anjos, L.; Almeida, R.

Patients with IMRD and COVID-19 according to the Ministry of Health criteria were classified as eligible for the study. RESULTS: 334 participants were enrolled, a majority of them women, with a median age of 45 years; systemic lupus erythematosus (32.9%) was the most frequent IMRD. Emergency care was required in 160 patients, 33.0% were hospitalised, 15.0% were admitted to the ICU and 10.5% underwent mechanical ventilation; 28 patients (8.4%) died.

Herein, we are proposing a novel variable [PaO(2)/(FiO(2)xPEEP) or P/FP(E)] for PEEP ≥ 5 to address Berlin’s definition gap for ARDS severity by using machine learning (ML) approaches. METHODS: We examined P/FP(E) values delimiting the boundaries of mild, moderate, and severe ARDS. We applied ML to predict ARDS severity after onset over time by comparing current Berlin PaO(2)/FiO(2) criteria with P/FP(E) under three different scenarios. We extracted clinical data from the first 3 ICU days after ARDS onset (N = 2738, 1519, and 1341 patients, respectively) from MIMIC-III database according to Berlin criteria for severity. Then, we used the multicenter database eICU (2014–2015) and extracted data from the first 3 ICU days after ARDS onset (N = 5153, 2981, and 2326 patients, respectively). Disease progression in each database was tracked along those 3 ICU days to assess ARDS severity. Three robust ML classification techniques were implemented using Python 3.7 (LightGBM, RF, and XGBoost) for predicting ARDS severity over time. RESULTS: P/FP(E) ratio outperformed PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio in all ML models for predicting ARDS severity after onset over time (MIMIC-III: AUC 0.711–0.788 and CORR 0.376–0.566; eICU: AUC 0.734–0.873 and CORR 0.511–0.745). CONCLUSIONS: The novel P/FP(E) ratio to assess ARDS severity after onset over time is markedly better than current PaO(2)/FiO(2) criteria. The use of P/FP(E) could help to manage ARDS patients with a more precise therapeutic regimen for each ARDS category of severity.

Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems provide a means of objectively capturing and quantifying deterioration under operational conditions. Computer vision technology has gained considerable attention in the field of SHM due to its ability to obtain displacement data using non-contact methods at long distances. Additionally, it provides a low cost, rapid instrumentation solution with low interference to the normal operation of structures. However, even in the case of a medium span bridge, the need for many cameras to capture the global response can be cost-prohibitive. This research proposes a roving camera technique to capture a complete derivation of the response of a laboratory model bridge under live loading, in order to identify bridge damage. Displacement is identified as a suitable damage indicator, and two methods are used to assess the magnitude of the change in global displacement under changing boundary conditions in the laboratory bridge model. From this study, it is established that either approach could detect damage in the simulation model, providing an SHM solution that negates the requirement for complex sensor installations.","Lydon, Darragh; Lydon, Myra; Kromanis, Rolands; Dong, Chuan-Zhi; Catbas, Necati; Taylor, Su",Sensors (Basel),545,3

Self-reported test results were compared with laboratory results, demographic data and behavioural facts were collected using a digital platform. In a cross-sectional design positive cases were compared with negative and untested control groups. FindingsApproximately 14 days after a countrywide lockdown in Norway, 116,678 participants were included. Median age was 46 years, 44% had children in preschool or in school; 18% were practicing health professionals. International flights, contact with infected, and gatherings of more than 50 people, were associated with high risk. Health professionals who used public transport were at higher risk of testing positive than those who did not. Having undergone light infections, the last six months was strongly associated with lower odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Contact with children, use of hand sanitiser and use of protective gloves in private were also associated with lower odds ratio of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.

The purpose of this review is to describe the role of behavioral medicine for CVD prevention, using physical activity behaviors (e.g., sedentary behavior, daily physical activity, or exercise) as an exemplar. Application of behavioral medicine to improve dietary behaviors is also briefly discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Behavioral medicine interventions that address physical activity behaviors are associated with improved cardiovascular risk factors. Interventions framed in behavior change theory that integrate behavior change techniques to reduce sedentary behavior and promote daily physical activity and exercise have similarly been applied to improve certain dietary behaviors and show promise for reducing CVD risk factors. SUMMARY: Behavioral medicine has an important role in improving various physical activity behaviors for all populations, which is essential for preventing or managing CVD. Further investigation into behavioral medicine interventions that address personal, environmental, and social factors that influence participation in physical activity behaviors, as well as the adoption of a more optimal dietary pattern, is warranted.","Hannan, Mary; Kringle, Emily; Hwang, Cheuh-Lung; Laddu, Deepika",Curr Atheroscler Rep,545,33

This cross-sectional study investigated the effects of a “quarantine” training camp on athlete's routines and wellbeing, performance support, perceived stress and sleep behaviors. A survey was completed at the end of a 30-day “quarantine” camp, by 76 elite athletes (17–46 years), predominantly (~80%) Olympic/Paralympic and/or world championship representatives. Athletes described their experiences in comparison to; pre-lockdown training and/or training during “lockdown” (immediately prior to the “quarantine” camp). Compared to “lockdown,” the “quarantine” camp revealed improvements (p < 0.05; 0.33 ≤ d ≤ 0.90) in access to sport-specific training (28.6%), recovery facilities (22.2%), nutritional choices (17.5%), mental (12.4%) and emotional (11.4%) health, training motivation (20.0%); and perceived stress (7.4%, d = −0.27, p = 0.026). The camp resulted in a lower sleep duration (−8.5%, d = −0.73, p = 0.014), but an improved global sleep behavior score (−5.6%, d = −0.22, p = 0.001). During the camp, the performance support athletes received was not different to pre-lockdown (p > 0.05), but there was greater sports massage (20.4%, d = 0.39) and physiotherapy usage (18.1%, d = 0.36) (both p < 0.05). The adverse effects of lockdown were restored during the camp. A “quarantine” camp may offer comparable training experiences to pre-lockdown training, without inducing additional perceived stress. Coaches and sporting organizations may consider this approach as part of a virus mitigation strategy, whilst maintaining sport-specific training.","Washif, Jad Adrian; Mohd Kassim, Siti Fuzyma Ayu; Lew, Philip Chun Foong; Chong, Christabelle Sheau Miin; James, Carl",Front Sports Act Living,545,20

Here, to uncover the potential abnormalities in coagulation pathways, we analyzed the RNA-seq data (GEO147507) obtained from the treatment of three pulmonary epithelial cell lines with SARS-CoV-2. The significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were subjected to Enrichr database for KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology (GO) functional annotation. The STRING database was used to generate PPI networks for identified DEGs.

As a result, the swine industry was confronted with a major occupational health, financial, and animal welfare crisis. The objective of this work was to describe the epidemiological situation within processing plants, develop mathematical models to simulate transmission in these plants, and test the effectiveness of routine PCR screening at minimizing SARS-CoV2 circulation. Cumulative incidence of clinical (PCR-confirmed) disease plateaued at ~2.5% to 25% across the three plants studied here. For larger outbreaks, antibody prevalence was approximately 30% to 40%. Secondly, we developed a mathematical model that accounts for asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and background “community” transmission. By calibrating this model to observed epidemiological data, we estimated the initial reproduction number (R) of the virus. Across plants, R generally ranged between 2 and 4 during the initial phase, but subsequently declined to ~1 after two to three weeks, most likely as a result of implementation/compliance with biosecurity measures in combination with population immunity. Using the calibrated model to simulate a range of possible scenarios, we show that the effectiveness of routine PCR-screening at minimizing disease spread was far more influenced by testing frequency than by delays in results, R, or background community transmission rates. Testing every three days generally averted about 25% to 40% of clinical cases across a range of assumptions, while testing every 14 days typically averted 7 to 13% of clinical cases. However, the absolute number of additional clinical cases expected and averted was influenced by whether there was residual immunity from a previous peak (i.e., routine testing is implemented after the workforce had experienced an initial outbreak). In contrast, when using PCR-screening to prevent outbreaks or in the early stages of an outbreak, even frequent testing may not prevent a large outbreak within the workforce. This research helps to identify protocols that minimize risk to occupational safety and health and support continuity of business for U.S. processing plants. While the model was calibrated to meat processing plants, the structure of the model and insights about testing are generalizable to other settings where large number of people work in close proximity.","VanderWaal, Kimberly; Black, Lora; Hodge, Judy; Bedada, Addisalem; Dee, Scott",PLoS One,545,18

In view of the advantages of sensitivity and high spatial resolution, CT imaging has played an important role in screening and diagnosing of COVID-19 in China. The radiologic technologists performing CT scans for the infected patients become high-risk medical care personnel.

The objective of the present work is to develop a method that is able to automatically determine mental status of vigilance, i.e., a person's state of alertness. Such a task is relevant to diverse domains, where a person is expected or required to be in a particular state of mind. Aiming at the EEG feature selection and classification model in the identification of fatigue driving, the discretization algorithm using rough set theory is proposed to select the channel and EEG signal feature quantities. The support vector machine (SVM) is selected as the fatigue driving recognition model, and the risk of fatigue misjudgment is taken as SVM model parameters for model optimization. The experimental results of subjects show that compared with the principal component method, the rough set discretization algorithm selects fewer features, and the compatibility threshold 0.8. The number of features selected among the candidate features is 208. The features selected by different subjects are different and have an impact on the establishment of the support vector machine recognition model. Fatigue misjudgment risk control parameters can adjust the support vector machine recognition model error judgment risk. Even if the present approach is costly in computation time, it allows constructing a decision rule that provides an accurate and fast prediction of the alertness state of an unseen individual.","Chitti, Sridevi; Kumar, J.

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of radiographers in the detection of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT using CO-RADS descriptors. METHODS: CT images of patients who underwent RT-PCR and chest CT due to COVID-19 suspicion between March and July 2020 were analysed retrospectively. Six readers, including two radiologists, two highly experienced radiographers and two less experienced radiographers, independently scored each CT using the CO-RADS lexicon. ROC curves were used to investigate diagnostic accuracy, and Fleiss’κ statistics to evaluate inter-rater agreement. RESULTS: 714 patients (419 men; 295 women; mean age: 64 years ±19SD) were evaluated. CO-RADS> 3 was identified as optimal diagnostic threshold. Highly experienced radiographers achieved an average sensitivity of 58.7% (95%CI: 52.5–64.7), an average specificity of 81.8% (95%CI: 77.9–85.2), and a mean AUC of 0.72 (95%CI: 0.68–0.75). Among less experienced radiographers, an average sensitivity of 56.3% (95%CI: 50.1–62.2) and an average specificity of 81.5% (95%CI: 77.6–84.9) were observed, with a mean AUC of 0.71 (95%CI: 0.68–0.74). Consultant radiologists achieved an average sensitivity of 60.0% (95%CI: 53.7–65.8), an average specificity of 81.7% (95%CI: 77.8–85.1), and a mean AUC of 0.73 (95%CI: 0.70–0.77). CONCLUSION: Radiographers can adequately recognise the classic appearances of COVID-19 on CT, as described by the CO-RADS assessment scheme, in a way comparable to expert radiologists. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Radiographers, as the first healthcare professionals to evaluate CT images in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, could diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia by means of a categorical reporting scheme at CT in a reliable way, hence playing a primary role in the early management of these patients.","Vicini, S.; Panvini, N.; Bellini, D.; Rengo, M.; Ciotola, M.; De Vivo, M.; Gambaretto, C.; Caldon, V.; Panno, S.; Del Borgo, C.; Carbone, I.",Radiography (Lond),545,1

While the baseline already shows a worrying food situation, our results suggest that the pandemic of Covid-19 contributes to a worsening of food security. First, the food deficit of poor rural and urban households worsens. Second, even if their food consumption decreases, the urban non-poor households seem to be resilient to the Covid-19 pandemic. The severity of food insecurity is increasing among poor households in rural and urban areas, whereas the non-poor rural households are likely to fall into the category of vulnerable people. Third, the negative impacts on food security can be explained by the combination of several factors such as a rise in food prices, a decrease in households’ incomes and remittances. Finally, the negative impact on food security seems permanent, as the deviation from the baseline persists over 10 years (2020–2030).","Zidouemba, Patrice Rélouendé; Kinda, Somlanare Romuald; Ouedraogo, Idrissa Mohamed",Eur J Dev Res,545,29

We carried out text mining in the scientific literature to draw up a list of genes referable to the term “SARS-CoV*”. We looked for frequent mutations that are likely to affect protein function in these genes. Ten genes, mostly involved in innate immunity, and thirteen common variants were identified, for some of these the involvement in COVID-19 is supported by publicly available epidemiological data. We looked for available data on the population distribution of these variants and we demonstrated that the prevalence of five of them, Arg52Cys (rs5030737), Gly54Asp (rs1800450) and Gly57Glu (rs1800451) in MBL2, Ala59Thr (rs25680) in CD27, and Val197Met (rs12329760) in TMPRSS2, correlates with the number of cases and/or deaths of COVID-19 observed in different countries.

This study was aimed to describe the clinicoepidemiological features and the causes of mortality of COVID-19 deceased patients admitted in a dedicated COVID center in India. METHODOLOGY: This was a retrospective study done in adult deceased patients admitted in COVID ICU from April 4 to July 24, 2020. The clinical features, comorbidities, complications, and causes of mortality in these patients were analyzed. Pediatric deceased were analyzed separately. RESULTS: A total of 654 adult patients were admitted in the ICU during the study period and ICU mortality was 37.7% (247/654). Among the adult deceased, 65.9% were males with a median age of 56 years [interquartile range (IQR), 41.5–65] and 94.74% had one or more comorbidities, most common being hypertension (43.3%), diabetes mellitus (34.8%), and chronic kidney disease (20.6%). The most common presenting features in these deceased were fever (75.7%), cough (68.8%), and shortness of breath (67.6%). The mean initial sequential organ failure assessment score was 9.3 ± 4.7 and 24.2% were already intubated at the time of admission. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (IQR, 3–11). The most common cause of death was sepsis with multi-organ failure (55.1%) followed by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (25.5%). All pediatric deceased had comorbid conditions and the most common cause of death in this group was severe ARDS. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of adult deceased, most were young males with age less than 65 years with one or more comorbidities, hypertension being the most common. Only 5% of the deceased had no comorbidities. Sepsis with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome was the most common cause of death.

B-HNL performed similarly with the exception of mild AKI and mortality (p < 0.001–0.004). The cohort was dichotomized by ROC estimated cutoff concentrations of 13.2 µg/L and 190 µg/L for P-HNL Dimer and B-HNL respectively. Increased cumulative risks for AKI, AKI stage 3, and death were observed if above the P-HNL cutoff and for AKI stage 3 if above the B-HNL cutoff. The relative risk of developing AKI stage 3 was nine and 39 times greater if above the cutoffs in plasma and whole blood, respectively, for CRRT eight times greater for both. In conclusion, systemically elevated neutrophil lipocalin, interpreted as increased neutrophil activity, was shown to be associated with an increased risk of severe AKI, renal replacement therapy, and mortality in COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure.","Bülow Anderberg, Sara; Lipcsey, Miklos; Hultström, Michael; Eriksson, Ann-Katrin; Venge, Per; Frithiof, Robert",J Clin Med,545,16

Lung ultrasound is well suited to this interstitial, subpleural involvement, and it is now broadly used in intensive care units (ICUs). The extension and severity of lung infiltrates can be described numerically with a reproducible and validated lung ultrasound score (LUSS). We hypothesized that LUSS might be useful as a tool to non-invasively monitor the evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia at the bedside. LUSS monitoring was rapidly implemented in the management of our COVID-19 patients with RT-PCR-documented COVID-19. The LUSS was evaluated repeatedly at the bedside. We present a graphic description of the course of LUSS during COVID-19 in 10 consecutive patients admitted in our intensive care unit with moderate to severe ARDS between March 15 and 30(th). LUSS appeared to be closely related to the disease progression. In successfully extubated patients, LUSS decreased and was lower than at the time of intubation. LUSS increased inexorably in a patient who died from refractory hypoxemia. LUSS helped with the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), showing an increased score and the presence of new lung consolidations in all 5 patients with VAPs. There was also a good agreement between CT-scans and LUSS as for the presence of lung consolidations. In conclusion, our early experience suggests that LUSS monitoring accurately reflect disease progression and indicates potential usefulness for the management of COVID-19 patients with ARDS. It might help with early VAP diagnosis, mechanical ventilation weaning management, and potentially reduce the need for X-ray and CT exams. LUSS evaluation is easy to use and readily available in ICUs throughout the world, and might be a safe, cheap and simple tool to optimize critically ill COVID-19 patients care during the pandemic.","Dargent, Auguste; Chatelain, Emeric; Kreitmann, Louis; Quenot, Jean-Pierre; Cour, Martin; Argaud, Laurent",PLoS One,545,21

Using an m(6)A-modified hairpin present in the Kaposi’s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) ORF50 RNA, we identified seven members from the ‘Royal family’ as putative m(6)A readers, including SND1. RIP-seq and eCLIP analysis characterised the SND1 binding profile transcriptome-wide, revealing SND1 as an m(6)A reader. We further demonstrate that the m(6)A modification of the ORF50 RNA is critical for SND1 binding, which in turn stabilises the ORF50 transcript. Importantly, SND1 depletion leads to inhibition of KSHV early gene expression showing that SND1 is essential for KSHV lytic replication. This work demonstrates that members of the ‘Royal family’ have m(6)A-reading ability, greatly increasing their epigenetic functions beyond protein methylation.","Baquero-Perez, Belinda; Antanaviciute, Agne; Yonchev, Ivaylo D; Carr, Ian M; Wilson, Stuart A; Whitehouse, Adrian",eLife,545,21

The doctors were asked to distribute and recollect the questionnaire after obtaining informed consent from the hospital administration, the nursing management and the works council. Descriptive statistics were used to explain the results. Results: 355 answers from 5 departments were evaluated. In 65 out of 72 hospitals the top managers of either hospital or nursing administration or the works council declined participation, 2 heads of department were not interested. 50,7% of HCW were already vaccinated or had a scheduled appointment for vaccination, 14,9% had not yet made up their mind and 34,4% refuse vaccination. The majority of HCW vote against compulsory vaccination (47,6%), less than a quarter approves it (23,4%). Conclusion: The willingness to vaccinate was extremely low in this survey. The main reason for refusal to vaccinate is fear of side effects, so an information campaign should primarily focus on this topic.","Ganslmeier, Andreas; Engelmann, Tom; Lucke, Martin; Täger, Georg; Pfeifer, Michael; Scherer, Michael A.",MMW Fortschr Med,545,1

Remote monitoring allows patients to record their signs and symptoms remotely (eg, while self-isolating at home) rather than requiring hospitalisation. Healthcare staff can, therefore, continually monitor their symptoms and be notified when the patient is showing signs of clinical deterioration. However, given the recency of the COVID-19 outbreak, there is a lack of research regarding the acceptance of remote monitoring interventions to manage COVID-19. This study will aim to evaluate the use of remote monitoring for managing COVID-19 cases from the perspective of both the patient and healthcare staff. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Discharged patients from a large urban teaching hospital in Ireland, who have undergone remote monitoring for COVID-19, will be recruited to take part in a cross-sectional study consisting of a quantitative survey and a qualitative interview. A mixed methods design will be used to understand the experiences of remote monitoring from the perspective of the patient. Healthcare staff who have been involved in the provision of remote monitoring of patients with COVID-19 will be recruited to take part in a qualitative interview to understand their experiences with the process. Structural equation modelling will be used to examine the acceptance of the remote monitoring technology. Latent class analysis will be used to identify COVID-19 symptom profiles. Interview data will be examined using thematic analysis.

However, 5 months after the first confirmed case, countries like the United States of America (US) seems to be heading towards a trajectory that indicates a health care crisis. This is in stark contrast to the downward trajectory in Europe, China, and elsewhere in Asia, where the number of new cases has seen a decline ahead of an anticipated second wave.

Rapid and ease-to-use diagnostic techniques are urgently needed to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We devised a reverse transcription multiple cross displacement amplification (RT-MCDA) coupled with nanoparticles-based biosensor (BS) assay (RT-MCDA-BS) for rapid, sensitive and specific diagnosis of COVID-19. Two primer sets were designed to target the open reading frame 1a/b (F1ab) and nucleoprotein gene (N) of SARS-CoV-2. A total of 183 clinical samples, including 65 patients with COVID-19 infections and 118 patients with other pathogen infections, were used to testify the assay's feasibility. The diagnosis results were visually reported using BS. FINDINGS: The designed assay was performed using a simple instrument which could maintain the reaction in a constant temperature at 64°C for only 35 min. The total procedure of COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS test could be finished within 1 h. The COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS could detect down to 5 copies of target sequences. Among 65 clinical samples from the COVID-19 patients, 22 (33.8%) positive results were obtained from face, nasal, pharyngeal and anal swabs via COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS assay, while rRT-PCR assay only detected 20 (30.7%) positive results in these samples. No positive results were obtained from clinical samples with non-COVID-19 infections. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS was a rapid, reliable, low cost and easy-to-use assay, which could provide an attractive laboratory tool to diagnose COVID-19 in multiple clinical specimens, especially for field, clinic laboratories and primary care facilities in resource-poor settings.","Li, Shijun; Jiang, Weijia; Huang, Junfei; Liu, Ying; Ren, Lijuan; Zhuang, Li; Zheng, Qinni; Wang, Ming; Yang, Rui; Zeng, Yi; Wang, Yi",Eur Respir J,545,1

Respiratory viruses are commonly detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic periods. The rates of infection and community epidemiology of respiratory viruses in healthy children needs further definition to assist interpretation of molecular diagnostic assays in this population. Children otherwise healthy aged 1 to 8 years were prospectively enrolled in the study during two consecutive winters, when ARIs peak in New Zealand. Parents completed a daily symptom diary for 8 weeks, during which time they collected a nasal swab from the child for each clinical ARI episode. A further nasal swab was collected by research staff during a clinic visit at the conclusion of the study. All samples were tested for 15 respiratory viruses commonly causing ARI using molecular multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays. There were 575 ARIs identified from 301 children completing the study, at a rate of 1.04 per child‐month. Swabs collected during an ARI were positive for a respiratory virus in 76.8% (307 of 400), compared with 37.3% (79 of 212) of swabs collected during asymptomatic periods. The most common viruses detected were human rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza viruses, influenzavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus. All of these were significantly more likely to be detected during ARIs than asymptomatic periods. Parent‐administered surveillance is a useful mechanism for understanding infectious disease in healthy children in the community. Interpretation of molecular diagnostic assays for viruses must be informed by understanding of local rates of asymptomatic infection by such viruses.","Walker, Gregory J.; Stelzer‐Braid, Sacha; Shorter, Caroline; Honeywill, Claire; Wynn, Matthew; Willenborg, Christiana; Barnes, Phillipa; Kang, Janice; Pierse, Nevil; Crane, Julian; Howden‐Chapman, Philippa; Rawlinson, William D.",J Med Virol,545,20

The objective of this systematic review was to explore the evidence in the literature on the safety and efficacy of their use as monotherapy and combination therapy in COVID-19 management. METHODS: After prospectively registering the study protocol with the Open Science Framework, we searched PubMed, Google Scholar, clinicaltrials.gov, various pre-print servers and reference lists for relevant records published until 16 February, 2021 using appropriate search strategies. Baseline features and data pertaining to efficacy and safety outcomes were extracted separately for IVM monotherapy, DOXY monotherapy, and IVM + DOXY combination therapy. Methodological quality was assessed based on the study design. RESULTS: Out of 200 articles screened, 19 studies (six retrospective cohort studies, seven randomised controlled trials, five non-randomised trials, one case series) with 8754 unique patients with multiple stages of COVID-19 were included; four were pre-prints and one was an unpublished clinicaltrials.gov document. The comparator was standard care and ‘hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin’ in seven and three studies respectively, and two studies were placebo controlled; six studies did not have a comparator. IVM monotherapy, DOXY monotherapy and IVM + DOXY were explored in eight, five and five studies, respectively; one study compared IVM monotherapy and IVM + DOXY with placebo. While all studies described efficacy, the safety profile was described in only six studies. Efficacy outcomes were mixed with some studies concluding in favour of the intervention and some studies displaying no significant benefit; barring one study that described 9/183 patients with erosive esophagitis and non-ulcer dyspepsia with IVM + DOXY (without causality assessment details), there were no new safety signals of concern with any of the three interventions considered. The quality of studies varied widely, with five studies having a ‘good’ methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is not sufficiently strong to either promote or refute the efficacy of IVM, DOXY, or their combination in COVID-19 management.

Healthcare personnel (HCP) were disproportionately affected, accounting for approximately 10% of notified cases. Exclusion from work for 7 days was recommended for HCP with high-risk occupational exposure. Our aim was to evaluate the 7-day exclusion from work policy for HCP with high-risk exposure. METHODS: HCP with a history of occupational exposure to COVID-19 were notified to the Hellenic National Public Health Organization, regardless of their exposure risk category. Exposed HCP were followed for 14 days after last exposure. RESULTS: We prospectively studied 3398 occupationally exposed HCP; nursing personnel accounted for most exposures (n=1705; 50.2%). Of the 3398 exposed HCP, 1599 (47.1%) were classified as low-risk, 765 (22.5%) as moderate-risk, and 1031 (30.4%) as high-risk exposures. Sixty-six (1.9%) HCP developed COVID-19 at a mean of 3.65 days (range: 0-17 days) post-exposure. Of the 66 HCP with COVID-19, 46, 7, and 13 had a history of high-, moderate- or low-risk exposure (4.5%, 0.9%, and 0.8% of all high-, moderate-, and low-risk exposures, respectively). Hospitalization and absenteeism were more prevalent among HCP with high-risk exposure. A logistic regression analysis showed that the following variables were significantly associated with an increased risk for the onset of COVID-19: male, administrative personnel, underlying disease and high-risk exposure. CONCLUSION: HCP with high-risk occupational exposure to COVID-19 had increased probability of serious morbidity, healthcare seeking, hospitalization and absenteeism.

The proposed model supports Foster's conceptualization of information practices as non-linear processes, but its emphasis on the interdependence between context and information practices provides a more effective means to capture complex negotiations involved in information-sharing practices. The proposition is that the major reason for nonlinearity in information practices is a continuous shifting of actors' interests, pressures, and concerns.

Participants underwent an experimental battery evaluating their singing, prosody comprehension, and prosody production. Singing samples were rated by 2 independent reviewers as subjectively “normal” or “abnormal,” and analyzed for properties of the fundamental frequency. Relationships between infarct location, singing, and prosody performance were evaluated using t tests and chi-squared analysis. Eighty percent of participants with LH cortical strokes were unable to successfully complete any of the tasks due to severe aphasia.
