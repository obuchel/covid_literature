3953,3953,3953,Exploratory cohort study to determine if dry cow vaccination with a Salmonella Newport bacterin can protect dairy calves against oral Salmonella challenge,20.16651,8.885452,2019-05-27,"BACKGROUND: Salmonellosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal calves, often occurring before preventative vaccines can be administered. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the protective effect on calves of colostrum from cows vaccinated with a commercially available Salmonella Newport bacterin against a Salmonella Typhimurium challenge. ANIMALS: Twenty Holstein bull calves from a university dairy farm. METHODS: Nonrandomized placebo‐controlled trial in which colostrum was harvested from 30 cows that received 2 doses of either Salmonella bacterin or saline before calving. Colostrum collected from each group was pooled and fed to 2 groups of 10 calves at birth. At approximately 2 weeks of age, calves were challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium. Clinical, hematologic, microbiological, and postmortem findings were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: No differences in mortality, clinical findings, hematology results, blood and fecal cultures, or necropsy findings between the 2 groups were observed. Vaccinated cows had higher colostral titers, and calves fed this colostrum had higher serum titers (mean difference, 0.429; mean [SE], 0.852 [0.02] for vaccinated versus 0.423 [0.02] for control calves). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Transfer of colostral immunoglobulins from Salmonella enterica serotype Newport bacterin to neonatal calves was not sufficient to decrease mortality, clinical signs, sepsis, intestinal damage, or fecal shedding when exposed to a highly pathogenic Salmonella isolate. A large‐scale randomized controlled clinical trial is needed to evaluate the efficacy of this bacterin when administered in the dry period for prevention of salmonellosis in neonatal calves.","Foster, Derek; Jacob, Megan; Stowe, Devorah; Smith, Geof",J Vet Intern Med,323,22

Aluminum hydroxide (alum) is the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant, yet its adjuvanticity is often weak and mechanisms of triggering antibody responses remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that site-specific modification of immunogens with short peptides composed of repeating phosphoserine (pSer) residues enhances binding to alum and prolongs immunogen bioavailability. The pSer-modified immunogens formulated in alum elicited greatly increased germinal center, antibody, neutralizing antibody, memory and long-lived plasma cell responses compared to conventional alum-adsorbed immunogens. Mechanistically, pSer-immunogen:alum complexes form nanoparticles that traffic to lymph nodes and trigger B cell activation through multivalent and oriented antigen display. Direct uptake of antigen-decorated alum particles by B cells upregulated antigen processing and presentation pathways, further enhancing B cell activation. These data provide insights into mechanisms of action of alum and introduce a readily translatable approach to significantly improve humoral immunity to subunit vaccines using a clinical adjuvant.","Moyer, Tyson J.; Kato, Yu; Abraham, Wuhbet; Chang, Jason Y.

The assay takes approximately 48 hours to perform and utilizes the same rabbit antirhinovirus hyperimmune serum as both the capture and detecting antibody. The latter has been biotin‐labelled and is detected via a streptavidin 3‐galactosidase preformed complex. This new assay has been found to be very sensitive, detecting human rhinovirus (HRV)‐EL and HRV‐2 at titres as low as 10(1.8) TCID(50) 100 μl(−1) and < 10(1) TCID(50) 100 μl(−1), respectively. Furthermore, when 57 different human rhinovirus serotypes were tested in both the HRV‐EL and HRV‐2 ELISA systems a total of 49 (86%) were found to be cross‐reactive. Of 36 clinical specimens tested by virus isolation, cell‐culture‐amplified (CCA) ELISA, and direct ELISA, 15 were positive by isolation, 11 by CCA‐ELISA, and 11 by direct ELISA. The overall correlation of the CCA and direct ELISA techniques with virus isolation was found to be 88.9% and 66.7%, respectively. The present study demonstrates that the ELISA system developed is a sensitive technique for the diagnosis of rhinovirus infections.","Dearden, C. J.; Al‐Nakib, W.",J Med Virol,323,22

A total of 12 enzymes were studied. The isoenzymes and antigens were electrophoretically separated on polyacrylamide gradient gels, and the patterns obtained were compared after appropriate staining for particular enzymes and reactivities with homologous and heterologous rabbit anti‐Acanthamoeba antisera. One of the human strains (CDC:1283:V013) was identified as A. healyi n. sp. because of its unique isoenzyme profiles for 11 of the 12 enzymes tested. The other human isolate was reidentified as A. culbertsoni because its isoenzyme profiles for 10 of 12 enzymes resembled those of A. culbertsoni, Lilly A‐1 strain. Since the isoenzyme profiles and the antigenic patterns of the fish isolate as well were remarkably similar to those of A. royreba, it was considered as a strain of A. royreba. Polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis appears to be a powerful technique for the study of isoenzymes and antigens of Acanthamoeba.","MOURA, HERCULES; WALLACE, SARA; VISVESVARA, GOVINDA S.",J Protozool,323,28

Methods and Results: This study monitored the numbers of faecal coliforms (i.e. thermotolerant coliforms), total coliforms, Escherichia coli and heterotrophic plate count bacteria on household surfaces in a rural village of Cambodia. Faecal coliform levels in Cambodia were highest on moist locations such as the plastic ladle used for sink water, the toilet seat surface and the cutting board surface with 100‐fold higher levels of faecal coliform bacteria than E. coli and 100‐fold higher levels of faecal coliforms than the US and Japanese studies. Conclusions: A single public health intervention barrier, such as an improved latrine, is only partially effective for household sanitation. For complete sanitation, multiple environmental barriers may be necessary. These barriers occur in a house constructed with easily washable surfaces, a chlorinated water distribution system, house climate control and cleaning product availability. Significance and Impact of the Study: Results of this study can be used to emphasize the importance of increasing household environmental sanitation barriers.","Sinclair, R.G.; Gerba, C.P.",Lett Appl Microbiol,323,22

Viral load and chemokine and cytokine assays were performed on serial samples from donors whose index and first follow-up samples tested negative for IgM. A total of 84% of the specimens obtained from viremic donors before IgM/IgG seroconversion demonstrated a decreasing viral load. Levels of interferon (IFN)-α ere significantly increased before IgM seroconversion, relative to those in control specimens. CXCL10 and CCL2 were significantly elevated in donor specimens obtained before IgM seroconversion, compared with those obtained after IgM seroconversion. These findings suggest that IFN-mediated innate immunity plays a key role in initial control of WNV replication.","Tobler, Leslie H.; Cameron, Mark J.; Lanteri, Marion C.; Prince, Harry E.; Danesh, Ali; Persad, Desmond; Lanciotti, Robert S.; Norris, Philip J.; Kelvin, David J.; Busch, Michael P.",J Infect Dis,323,22

The objective of this study was to develop a quantitative loop-mediated isothermal amplification (qLAMP) assay for the rapid diagnosis of N-AstV characterized with gout, hemorrhage, and swellings of the kidneys. A set of 4 specific primers, 2 inner and 2 outer primers, targeting the ORF1a gene of N-AstV were designed for the assay which could be completed within 60 min at 65°C in a water bath or on a real-time PCR instrument for quantitative analysis. The qLAMP assay showed a high sensitivity with a detection limit of 1 × 10(1) copies of the target DNA/μL. There were no cross-reactions with other viruses, and the reproducibility of the assay was confirmed in intrasensitivity and intersensitivity assay tests with variability ranging from 0.61 to 2.21%. The results indicated that the qLAMP assay for N-AstV was a simple, accurate, rapid, sensitive, and specific, especially useful for field detection.","He, Dalin; Yang, Jing; Jiang, Xiaoning; Lin, Yun; Chen, Hao; Tang, Yi; Diao, Youxiang",Poult Sci,323,22

We adjusted contact-based coverage estimates, taking into consideration the inputs required to deliver quality nutrition services, to calculate input-adjusted coverage of nutrition interventions across the continuum of care from pregnancy through early childhood in Bangladesh. METHODS: We used data from the 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys to assess use of maternal and child health services and the 2014 Service Provision Assessment to determine facility readiness to deliver nutrition interventions. Service readiness captured availability of nutrition-specific inputs (including human resources and training, equipment, diagnostics and medicines). Contact coverage was combined with service readiness to create a measure of input-adjusted coverage at the national and regional levels, across place of residence, and by maternal education and household socioeconomic quintiles. RESULTS: Contact coverage varied from 28% for attending at least four ANC visits to 38% for institutional delivery, 35% for child growth monitoring and 81% for sick child care. Facilities demonstrated incomplete readiness for nutrition interventions, ranging from 48% to 51% across services. Nutrition input-adjusted coverage was suboptimal (18% for ANC, 23% for institutional delivery, 20% for child growth monitoring and 52% for sick child care) and varied between regions within the country. Inequalities in input-adjusted coverage were large during ANC and institutional delivery (14–17 percentage points (pp) between urban and rural areas, 15 pp between low and high education, and 28-34 pp between highest and lowest wealth quintiles) and less variable for sick child care (<2 pp). CONCLUSION: Nutrition input-adjusted coverage was suboptimal and varied subnationally and across the continuum of care in Bangladesh. Special efforts are needed to improve the reach as well as the quality of health and nutrition services to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.","Nguyen, Phuong Hong; Khương, Long Quỳnh; Pramanik, Priyanjana; Billah, Sk Masum; Menon, Purnima; Piwoz, Ellen; Leslie, Hannah H",BMJ Open,323,27

We report a quality initiative aimed at reducing avoidable interruptions during neonatal handoffs while monitoring handoff duration and provider satisfaction. METHODS: Observational time series between August 2015 and March 2018 in an academic level IV NICU. NICU I-PASS and process changes were implemented using plan–do–study–act cycle, and statistical process control charts were used in the analysis. Unmatched preintervention and postintervention satisfaction surveys were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: There was special cause variation in the mean number of avoidable interruptions per handoff from 4 to 0.3 (92% reduction). The mean duration of handoff was reduced ~1 min/patient. Provider satisfaction with the quality of handoffs also improved from a mean of 3.36 to 3.75 on a 1–5 Likert scale (p=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Standardisation of NICU handoff with NICU I-PASS and process changes led to the sustained reduction in avoidable interruptions with the added benefit of reduced handoff length and improved provider satisfaction.","Quinones Cardona, Vilmaris; LaBadie, Alison; Cooperberg, David B; Zubrow, Alan; Touch, Suzanne M",BMJ Open Qual,323,1

Risk factors for PND include stressful life events, history of depression, poor social support, unplanned and unwanted pregnancies, poor relationship quality, current or previous abuse, and low socioeconomic status. This mental disorder has been shown to have negative effects on mothers' quality of life and their intimate relationships, birth outcomes, and breastfeeding likelihood, as well as long-term effects on children's cognitive and emotional development. To date, no nationally representative study has examined whether there are socioeconomic and/or racial/ethnic differences in PND. This study discusses the prevalence and risk factors for PND, as well as its health consequences for mothers and children, the reasons for its underreporting and undertreatment, the evidence for different screening instruments and different treatment options, and the existing supportive policies to address this disorder in the United States.

To understand the perspective and usage of the MSPE across multiple medical specialties now and in anticipation of the planned changes in USMLE Step 1 score-reporting. A survey instrument including quantitative and qualitative measures was developed and piloted. The final survey was distributed to residency programs across 28 specialties in 2020 via the main contact on the ACGME listserv. Of the 28 specialties surveyed, at least one response was received from 26 (93%). Eight percent of all programs (364/4675) responded to the survey, with most respondents being program directors. Usage of the MSPE varied among specialties. Approximately 1/3 of end-users stated that the MSPE is very or extremely influential in their initial screening process. Slightly less than half agreed or strongly agreed that they trust the information to be an accurate representation of applicants, though slightly more than half agree that the MSPE will become more influential once USMLE Step 1 becomes pass/fail. Professionalism was rated as the most important component and noteworthy characteristics among the least important in the decision-making process. Performance in the internal medicine clerkship was rated as the most influential while neurology and psychiatry performances were rated as less influential. Overwhelmingly, respondents suggested that including comparative performance and/or class rank would make the MSPE more useful once USMLE Step 1 becomes pass/fail. MSPE end-users across a variety of specialties utilize this complex document in different ways and value it differentially in their decision-making processes. Despite this, continued mistrust of the MSPE persists. A better understanding of end-users’ perceptions of the MSPE offers the UME community an opportunity to transform the MSPE into a highly valued, trusted document of communication.","Bird, Jeffrey B.; Friedman, Karen A.; Arayssi, Thurayya; Olvet, Doreen M.; Conigliaro, Rosemarie L.; Brenner, Judith M.",,323,1

The growing emergence of colistin resistance in Escherichia coli (E. coli) represents a serious health threat, particularly to intensive care unit (ICU) patients. (2) Methods: In this work, we investigated the emergence of colistin resistance in 140 nosocomial E. coli isolated from patients with pneumonia and admitted to the chest ICU over 36 months. Virulence and resistance-related genes and E. coli pathotypes in colistin-resistant and colistin-sensitive isolates were determined. (3) Results: Colistin resistance was observed in 21/140 (15%) of the nosocomial E. coli isolates. The MIC(50) of the resistant strains was 4 mg/L, while MIC(90) was 16 mg/L. Colistin-resistant isolates were also co-resistant to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol. The mechanism of colistin resistance was represented by the presence of mcr-1 in all resistant strains. Respectively, 42.9% and 36.1% of colistin-resistant and colistin-sensitive groups were extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers, while 23.8% and 21% were metallo β-lactamase (MBL) producers. bla(TEM-type) was the most frequently detected ESBL gene, while bla(IMP-type) was the most common MBL in both groups. Importantly, most resistant strains showed a significantly high prevalence of astA (76.2%), aggR (76.2%), and pic (52.4%) virulence-related genes. Enteroaggregative E. coli (76%) was the most frequently detected genotype among the colistin-resistant strains. (4) Conclusion: The high colistin resistance rate observed in E. coli strains isolated from patients with nosocomial pneumonia in our university hospital is worrisome. These isolates carry different drug resistance and virulence-related genes. Our results indicate the need for careful monitoring of colistin resistance in our university hospital. Furthermore, infection control policies restricting the unnecessary use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems are necessary.","El-Mokhtar, Mohamed A.; Daef, Enas; Mohamed Hussein, Aliae A.

We focus here on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor nAChR-α7, a homopentameric channel widely expressed in the human brain, with a proven role in a wide spectrum of disorders including schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease. By exploiting an all-atom structural model of the full (transmembrane and extracellular) protein in the open, agonist-bound conformation we recently developed, we evaluate the free energy and the mean first passage time of single-ion permeation using molecular dynamics simulations and the milestoning method with Voronoi tessellation. The results for the wild-type channel provide the first available mapping of the potential of mean force in the full-length α7 nAChR, reveal its expected cationic nature, and are in good agreement with simulation data for other channels of the LGIC family and with experimental data on nAChRs. We then investigate the role of a specific mutation directly related to ion selectivity in LGICs, the E-1′ → A-1′ substitution at the cytoplasmatic selectivity filter. We find that the mutation strongly affects sodium and chloride permeation in opposite directions, leading to a complete inversion of selectivity, at variance with the limited experimental results available that classify this mutant as cationic. We thus provide structural determinants for the observed cationic-to-anionic inversion, revealing a key role of the protonation state of residue rings far from the mutation, in the proximity of the hydrophobic channel gate.","Cottone, Grazia; Chiodo, Letizia; Maragliano, Luca",J Chem Inf Model,323,12

Involvement influences the design, delivery and dissemination of research, ultimately leading to better services, treatments and care. Researchers are therefore keen to involve patients, carers and public in their work, but are sometimes uncertain about who to involve. Some confusion may arise from the terms used. The UK’s catch-all term ‘patient and public involvement’ suggests this is a single activity, that perhaps both ‘patient’ and ‘public’ input are needed, or that either will do. The terms ‘patient’, ‘carer’ and ‘public’ have been defined, but are not used consistently. In fact there are many different contexts for involvement and many different kinds of decisions made, which then determine whose input will be most valuable. Clarity about the ‘why’ can help answer the ‘who’ question. However, not all researchers are clear about the purpose of involvement. While it is often understood to have a moral purpose, or to improve research quality, this doesn’t always identify who needs to be involved. When learning is understood to be the purpose of involvement, then the most appropriate people to involve are those with relevant experiential knowledge. In research projects, these are people with lived experience of the topic being investigated. This could be patients, carers, members of the public or health professionals. In this article we discuss how involving people who do not have the relevant experiential ‘lived’ knowledge may contribute to ineffective or tokenistic involvement. These people are as likely as researchers to make assumptions, risking missing key insights or resulting in outcomes that are off-putting or even harmful to research participants. We conclude that greater attention needs to be given to the question of who to involve. Raising awareness of the significance of experiential knowledge and the contextual factors that determine whose input will be most useful will help everyone to understand their roles and improve the quality of involvement. It will help to maximise the opportunities for learning, increasing the likelihood of impact, and helping to achieve the ultimate goal of improved health and services.","Staley, Kristina; Elliott, Jim; Stewart, Derek; Wilson, Roger",Res Involv Engagem,323,1

Membership of an interest group was protective against IPV (OR = 0.430, 95% CI = 0.193–0.957) whilst the belief that a good wife obeys her partner even if she disagrees (OR = 9.201, 95% CI = 1.299–65.194) and the belief that it is the wife’s obligation to have sex with the husband even if she doesn’t feel like (OR = 2.356, 95% CI = 1.049–5.288) were risk factors. CONCLUSION: The burden of IPV in the studied rural community is enormous. There should be public enlightenment to desensitise people regarding the erroneous views that encourage partner violence. We encourage women to become a part of social groups that can enhance their education and empowerment.","Ikekwuibe, Israel C.; Okoror, Collins E.M.",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,323,17

While septic acute kidney injury generates new morbidity in pediatric critically ill patients, acquired morbidities and functional status of CKRT population are unknown. We predicted that CKRT survivors are at risk for new morbidity and would have worse functional status at PICU discharge compared to baseline, and aimed to describe associated factors. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study over 24 months of CKRT patients surviving to PICU discharge in a quaternary children’s hospital. Functional outcome was determined by Functional Status Scale (FSS). RESULTS: FSS scores were higher at PICU and hospital discharge compared to baseline. Of 45 CKRT survivors, 31 (69%) had worse FSS score at PICU discharge and 51% had new morbidity (≥3 increase in FSS); majority qualified as moderate to severe disability (FSS ≥10). Four patients (9%) had new tracheostomy, 3 (7%) were ventilator dependent, and 10 (22%) were dialysis dependent. Most (23/45, 51%) required outpatient rehabilitation. Cumulative days on sedation, controlled for illness severity, were independently associated with worse FSS at PICU discharge (aOR 25.18 (3.73, 169.92)). In adjusted analyses, duration of sedation was associated with new morbidity, while neurologic comorbidity, percent fluid overload at CKRT start, and nonrenal comorbidity were associated with moderate to severe disability at PICU discharge when controlled for baseline FSS. CONCLUSIONS: CKRT survivors, with new morbidity and worse functional outcomes at PICU discharge, are a newly described vulnerable population requiring targeted follow-up. Deliberate decrease of sedation exposure in patients with decreased clearance due to organ dysfunction needs to be studied as a modifiable risk factor.

Stratification of ccRCC is important since distinct subtypes differ in prognosis and treatment. Here, we applied a systems biology approach to stratify ccRCC into three molecular subtypes with different mRNA expression patterns and prognosis of patients. Further, we developed a set of biomarkers that could robustly classify the patients into each of the three subtypes and predict the prognosis of patients. Then, we reconstructed subtype-specific metabolic models and performed essential gene analysis to identify the potential drug targets. We identified four drug targets, including SOAT1, CRLS1, and ACACB, essential in all the three subtypes and GPD2, exclusively essential to subtype 1. Finally, we repositioned mitotane, an FDA-approved SOAT1 inhibitor, to treat ccRCC and showed that it decreased tumor cell viability and inhibited tumor cell growth based on in vitro experiments.","Li, Xiangyu; Kim, Woonghee; Juszczak, Kajetan; Arif, Muhammad; Sato, Yusuke; Kume, Haruki; Ogawa, Seishi; Turkez, Hasan; Boren, Jan; Nielsen, Jens; Uhlen, Mathias; Zhang, Cheng; Mardinoglu, Adil",iScience,323,17

The southern Amery Ice Shelf has an extensive surface hydrological system, and we present data from satellite imagery and ICESat‐2 showing a rapid surface disruption there in winter 2019, covering ∼60 km(2). We interpret this as an ice‐covered lake draining through the ice shelf, forming an ice doline with a central depression reaching 80 m depth amidst over 36 m uplift. Flexural rebound modeling suggests 0.75 km(3) of water was lost. We observed transient refilling of the doline the following summer with rapid incision of a narrow meltwater channel (20 m wide and 6 m deep).

Adaptive immune responses to fungi and extracellular bacteria are impaired in the absence of IL-6. IL-6 is also required for the induction of ROR-γt(+) Treg cells, which are gatekeepers of homeostasis in the gut lamina propria in the presence of commensal bacteria. Conversely, severe immunopathology in T cell-mediated autoimmunity is mediated by Th17 cells that rely on IL-6 for their generation and maintenance. Recently, it has been discovered that the differentiation of these distinct T helper cell subsets may be linked to distinct signaling modalities of IL-6. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the mode of action of IL-6 in the differentiation and maintenance of T cell subsets and propose that a context-dependent understanding of the impact of IL-6 on T cell subsets might inform rational IL-6-directed interventions in autoimmunity and chronic inflammation.","Korn, Thomas; Hiltensperger, Michael",Cytokine,323,17

Despite efforts by countries to achieve the SDG targets, mental health challenges remain major public health concerns globally. We examined the prevalence and predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress as well as the comorbidities of these mental health issues among adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a community-based cross-sectional study conducted among 2456 adults in four districts of the Volta Region of Ghana using data from the UHAS-Yonsei University Partnership Project. We analysed the data using frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, correlation, and binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 51.8% of the participants had at least one of the mental health issues examined. The prevalence of a mental health issue was 25.2%, 53.3%, and 9.7% for depression, anxiety, and stress respectively. Participants constituting 8.3% experienced all three mental health issues as comorbidities. Participants’ level of formal education and income significantly predicted depression, anxiety, and stress respectively at the multivariable level. Adults with a tertiary level of education were, for instance, 68% (AOR = 0.32, 95%CI = 0.15–0.66), 65% (AOR = 0.35, 95%CI = 0.17–0.73), and 50% (AOR = 0.50, 95%CI = 0.33–0.76) less likely to experience depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively compared with those who had no formal education. CONCLUSION: The majority of our study participants either experienced depression, anxiety, or stress. There were quite high comorbidities of the mental health issues among the adult population. To accelerate progress towards the achievement of SDG 3.4 target of promoting mental health and wellbeing for all by the year 2030, there is a need for effective implementation of the country’s 2012 Mental Health Act which makes provisions for the establishment of a Mental Health Fund. This could improve the financial circumstances of indigenes as income has been realised in the present study as an important factor influencing depression, anxiety, and stress among the adult population.","Amu, Hubert; Osei, Eric; Kofie, Philip; Owusu, Richard; Bosoka, Samuel Adolf; Konlan, Kennedy Diema; Kim, Eunji; Orish, Verner Ndudiri; Maalman, Raymond Saa-Eru; Manu, Emmanuel; Parbey, Phyllis Atta; Saah, Farrukh Ishaque; Mumuni, Hadiru; Appiah, Prince Kubi; Komesuor, Joyce; Ayanore, Martin Amogre; Amenuvegbe, Gregory Kofi; Kim, Siwoo; Jung, Hajun; Adjuik, Martin; Tarkang, Elvis Enowbeyang; Alhassan, Robert Kaba; Donkor, Ernestina Safoa; Zottor, Francis Bruno; Kweku, Margaret; Amuna, Paul; Kim, So Yoo; Gyapong, John Owusu",PLoS One,323,10

We find that women overall, as well as female political party members, workers, and workplace leaders in particular, share a distinctively female perspective that more heavily emphasizes caution with respect to COVID-19 compared with men. Given the limited representation of women leaders across most industries and in politics, COVID-19 regulations are thus likely to be less cautious than would be the case if there were an equitable representation of women across leadership roles. We argue that female employees, in particular, face a representational “double whammy” for COVID-19: gender imbalances in workplace leadership create inequities that are compounded—rather than redressed—by unequal political representation. We conclude by addressing how this dynamic may enhance the movement of women away from Republican candidates moving forward.","Brooks, Deborah Jordan; Saad, Lydia",,323,1

The duration of viral shedding in SOT recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. METHODS: All SOT recipients with a diagnosed of SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal of bronchoalveolar lavage RT-qPCR from March 06, 2020 to May 31, 2020 were identified. Viral shedding duration was obtained by evaluating all subsequent SARS-CoV-2 PCR results following initial positivity over time. Severity classification was defined as mild (outpatient), moderate (hospitalized), and severe (ICU level care). Data were obtained from electronic medical record case review and analyzed with Stata 16. RESULTS: 71 patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test were identified. 50 (70.4%) were classified as mild/moderate disease, while 21 (29.5%) had severe disease. Median age was 56.5 (IQR 45 – 61.3) years, and 56.9% (n = 41) were male. Older age was significantly associated with severe disease. A disproportionate number of patients were African American/Black or Hispanic at 72.2% (n=52). Interestingly, Caucasian race was significantly associated with less severe outcomes (p=0.038). The majority of patients were kidney transplant recipients (46, 63.9%), followed by liver (13, 18.1%), heart (6, 8.3%), lung (3, 4.2%), and pancreas (9, 12.5%) with a median duration from transplantation at 5 (IQR 3 – 17) years. Overall mortality was 5.6% (n=4), with all deaths occurring only in those with severe disease (19.1%, n=4). Prolonged viral shedding was observed in few patients, with median duration of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity at 32 (IQR 18.5 – 41.0) days. One kidney recipient was observed with up to 64 days of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from initial diagnosis despite not developing severe disease.

Several vaccines are currently approved for emergency use in the population, while ongoing studies continue to provide information on their safety and effectiveness. CoronaVac is an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with a good safety and immunogenicity profile as seen in phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials around the world, with an effectiveness of 65.9% for symptomatic cases. Although vaccination reduces the risk of disease, infections can still occur during or after completion of the vaccination schedule (breakthrough cases). This report describes the clinical and immunological profile of vaccine breakthrough cases reported in a clinical trial in progress in Chile that is evaluating the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of two vaccination schedules of CoronaVac (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04651790). Out of the 2,263 fully vaccinated subjects, at end of June 2021, 45 have reported symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection 14 or more days after the second dose (1.99% of fully vaccinated subjects). Of the 45 breakthrough cases, 96% developed mild disease; one case developed a moderate disease; and one developed a severe disease and required mechanical ventilation. Both cases that developed moderate and severe disease were adults over 60 years old and presented comorbidities. The immune response before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection was analyzed in nine vaccine breakthrough cases, revealing that six of them exhibited circulating anti-S1-RBD IgG antibodies with neutralizing capacities after immunization, which showed a significant increase 2 and 4 weeks after symptoms onset. Two cases exhibited low circulating anti-S1-RBD IgG and almost non-existing neutralizing capacity after either vaccination or infection, although they developed a mild disease. An increase in the number of interferon-γ-secreting T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 was detected 2 weeks after the second dose in seven cases and after symptoms onset. In conclusion, breakthrough cases were mostly mild and did not necessarily correlate with a lack of vaccine-induced immunity, suggesting that other factors, to be defined in future studies, could lead to symptomatic infection after vaccination with CoronaVac.","Duarte, Luisa F.; Gálvez, Nicolás M.

64391,64391,64391,Exercise training in paediatric congenital heart disease: fit for purpose?,20.277714,8.858719,2021-09-17,"Induction of the endogenous innate immune system by interferon (IFN) triggers the expression of many proteins that serve like alarm bells in the body, activating an immune response. After a viral infection, one of the genes activated by IFN induction is the IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) that encodes an ubiquitin-like protein that undergoes a reversible post-translational modification (ISGylation). ISG15 can also act unconjugated, intracellularly and secreted, acting as a cytokine. Although ISG15 has an essential role in host-defense responses to microbial infection, it remains to be defined its role as immunomodulator in the vaccine field. In this investigation, we showed that ISG15 exerts an immunomodulatory role in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines. In mice, after priming with a DNA-ISG15 vector mixed with a DNA expressing HIV-1 gp120 followed by a booster with an MVA vector expressing HIV-1 antigens, both ISG15 conjugated (ISG15-wt) or unconjugated (ISG15-mut) act as immune adjuvants by increasing the magnitude and quality of HIV-1-specific CD8 T cells, with ISG15-wt providing better immunostimulatory activity than ISG15-mut. The HIV-1 Env-specific CD8 T cell responses showed a predominant T effector memory (TEM) phenotype in all groups. Moreover, the amount of DNA-gp120 used to immunize mice could be reduced 5-fold after mixing with DNA-ISG15 without affecting the potency and the quality of the HIV-1 Env-specific immune responses. Our study clearly highlights the potential use of the IFN-induced ISG15 protein as immune adjuvant to enhance immune responses to HIV antigens, suggesting that this molecule might be exploitable for prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine approaches against pathogens.IMPORTANCE Our study described the potential role of ISG15 as an immunomodulatory molecule in the optimization of HIV/AIDS vaccine candidates. Using a DNA prime/MVA boost immunization protocol, our results indicated an increase in the potency and the quality of the HIV-1 Env-specific CD8 T cell response. These results highlight the adjuvant potency of ISG15 to elicit improved viral antigen presentation to the immune system, resulting in an enhanced HIV-1 vaccine immune response. The DNA-ISG15 vector could find applicability in the vaccine field in combination with other nucleic acid-based vector vaccines.","Elena Gómez, Carmen; Perdiguero, Beatriz; Falqui, Michela; Quirós, María; Bécares, Martina; Sorzano, Carlos Óscar S; García-Arriaza, Juan; Esteban, Mariano; Guerra, Susana",Journal of virology,323,1

While significant amounts of research have focused on outdoor air quality, to date there have been no studies that examined simultaneous long-term trends on indoor and outdoor air quality on a site using research-grade sensors. We measured fine particulate matter (PM2.5) for a year using sensors located on the rooftop, air handling room, and indoor office space in a building and captured the impacts of three types of regularly occurring elevated pollution events: wintertime atmospheric inversions, wildfires, and fireworks. The events had different magnitudes and durations, and infiltration rates varied for each event leading to dissimilar indoor air pollution levels. The building's air handling unit and different environmental conditions (lower indoor humidity and temperature during the winter) combined to reduce indoor pollution from inversion events however, particulate matter from wildfires and fireworks infiltrated at higher rates. Together, this suggests possible intervention strategies, such as ventilation rates and filter upgrades, that could be used to mitigate contaminant intrusion during elevated pollution events. This year-long study illustrates an array of ways that elevated pollution events interact with the protective effects that buildings have against air pollution for its occupants. Furthermore, we show that outdoor air pollution is an important variable to consider when studying indoor air quality as contaminant infiltration is strongly dependent on the specific pollution source.","Mendoza, Daniel L; Benney, Tabitha M; Boll, Sarah",The Science of the total environment,323,1

Previous research showed an effect of foot type on postural stability. However, the specific effect of supinated feet remains unclear. RESEARCH QUESTION Our study aimed to assess the effect of foot type on postural stability, while taking potential confounding effects of body mass and body height into account. METHODS Forty-three healthy participants between 18 and 40 years old performed barefooted single leg stance tests with eyes open (EO) and closed (EC) on solid ground, and on a balance board (BB). Foot type was determined from pressure recordings during gait, using the arch index. Ground reaction forces were measured using a force plate. Outcome measures were Center of Pressure Velocity (COPV) divided by body height, and the Horizontal Ground Reaction Force (HGRF) divided by body mass. Generalized Estimating Equations models assessed the differences between supinated, normal and pronated feet during EO, EC and on a BB. RESULTS During EO an interaction between supinated feet and body mass showed an increase of COPV with 0.03 × 10-2 1/s per kilogram of mass relative to normal feet (p = .03). During EC this interaction was more pronounced with 0.22 × 10-2 1/s increase per kilogram mass (p < .01). The HGRF did not differ between foot types in any of the conditions. SIGNIFICANCE Supinated feet have a larger increase in COPV compared to normal feet with increasing mass when standing on solid ground during EO and EC. This indicates that people with supinated feet and a higher mass are less stable during single leg stance.

However, it has always been accused of being a coercive, unethical, and dangerous modality of treatment. The dangerousness of ECT has been mainly attributed to its claimed ability to cause brain damage. This narrative review aims to provide an update of the evidence with regard to whether the practice of ECT is associated with damage to the brain. An accepted definition of brain damage remains elusive. There are also ethical and technical problems in designing studies that look at this question specifically. Thus, even though there are newer technological tools and innovations, any review attempting to answer this question would have to take recourse to indirect methods. These include structural, functional, and metabolic neuroimaging; body fluid biochemical marker studies; and follow-up studies of cognitive impairment and incidence of dementia in people who have received ECT among others. The review of literature and present evidence suggests that ECT has a demonstrable impact on the structure and function of the brain. However, there is a lack of evidence at present to suggest that ECT causes brain damage.","Jolly, Amal Joseph; Singh, Shubh Mohan",Indian journal of psychiatry,323,30

Abnormalities on non-contrast CT (NCCT) such as ischaemic strokes, intracerebral haemorrhage and subarachnoid haemorrhages are frequently observed on brain imaging of patients with RCVS though their prevalence varies considerably between studies. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to estimate the prevalence of NCCT abnormalities seen on neuroimaging of adult patients with RCVS. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search the Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library databases for studies on the prevalence of NCCT abnormalities on neuroimaging of patients with RCVS. Search results will be screened for eligibility by title and abstract. Suitable studies will be fully reviewed and relevant data extracted using a data abstraction form. The studies will be assessed for methodological quality, risk of bias and heterogeneity. Prevalence estimates across studies will be pooled using a random-effects model and subgroup analysis will be performed to assess the impact of age, sex, publication year and study design on prevalence of vascular lesions. Sensitivity analysis will be used to investigate the robustness of the findings. This protocol has been devised using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 checklist.

Given the influence of systemic blood pressure on pulpal blood flow, anxiolytics prescribed may alter the pulpal blood flow along with the local anesthetic solution containing a vasoconstrictor. This study evaluated the impact of preoperative anxiolytics and vasoconstrictors in local anesthetic agents on pulpal oxygen saturation. Methods. Thirty anxious young healthy individuals with a mean age of 24 years were randomly selected using the Corah's Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS). After checking the vital signs the initial pulpal oxygen saturation (initial SpO2) was measured using a pulse oximeter. Oral midzolam was administered at a dose of 7.5 mg. After 30 min, the vital signs were monitored and the pulpal oxygen saturation (anxiolytic SpO2) was measured. A total of 1.5 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:200000 epinephrine was administered as buccal infiltration anesthesia and 10 min the final pulpal oxygen saturation (L.A SpO2) was measured. Results. The mean initial (SpO2) was 96.37% which significantly decreased to 90.76% (SpO2) after the administration of the anxiolytic agent. This drop was later accentuated to 85.17% (SpO2) after administration of local anesthetic solution. Statistical significance was set at P<0.0001. Conclusion. High concentrations of irritants may permeate dentin due to a considerable decrease in the pulpal blood flow from crown or cavity preparation. Therefore, maintaining optimal blood flow during restorative procedures may prevent pulpal injury.","P Shetty, Krishna; V Satish, Sarvepalli; Kilaru, Krishnarao; Chakravarthi Ponangi, Kalyana; M Luke, Alexander; Neshangi, Srisha","Journal of dental research, dental clinics, dental prospects",323,26

Boosting innate immunity with Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) or other live attenuated vaccines may also play a role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. BCG has long been known for its non-specific beneficial effects, most likely explained by epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells, termed trained immunity. In this issue of the JCI, Rivas et al. add to these arguments by showing that BCG-vaccinated healthcare providers from a Los Angeles healthcare organization had less COVID-19 diagnosis and serology, compared to unvaccinated individuals. Prospective clinical trials are thus warranted to explore BCG effects in COVID-19.

METHOD Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for relevant publications up to March 2019. Studies assessing risk factors of NBPP in relation to typically developing comparison individuals were included. Meta-analysis was performed for the five most significant risk factors, on the basis of the PRISMA statement and MOOSE guidelines. Pooled odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and across-study heterogeneity (I2 ) were reported. Reporting bias and quality of evidence was rated. In addition, we assessed the incidence of NBPP. RESULTS Twenty-two observational studies with a total sample size of 29 419 037 live births were selected. Significant risk factors included shoulder dystocia (OR 115.27; 95% CI 81.35-163.35; I2 =92%), macrosomia (OR 9.75; 95% CI 8.29-11.46; I2 =70%), (gestational) diabetes (OR 5.33; 95% CI 3.77-7.55; I2 =59%), instrumental delivery (OR 3.8; 95% CI 2.77-5.23; I2 =77%), and breech delivery (OR 2.49; 95% CI 1.67-3.7; I2 =70%).

We aimed to determine normal 3DHRAM values in children. METHODS We performed a prospective study of 61 children (34 male; mean age, 8.28 years) without any symptoms arising from the lower gastrointestinal tract who were evaluated at the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland. Manometry procedures were performed by using a rigid probe without medication. Pressure within the anal canal and 3D images of sphincters were measured. If possible, squeeze pressure and thresholds of sensation were evaluated. The population was divided into age groups of <5 years, 5-8 years, 9-12 years, and older than 12 years. RESULTS The mean resting and squeeze sphincter pressures were 83 ± 23 mm Hg and 191 ± 64 mm Hg, respectively. The mean length of the anal canal was 2.62 ± 0.68 cm and correlated with age (r = 0.49, P < .0001). The mean rectal balloon volume to elicit rectoanal inhibitory reflex was 15.7 ± 10.9 cm(3). The first sensation, urge, and discomfort were observed at balloon volumes of 24.4 ± 23.98 cm(3), 45.9 ± 34.55 cm(3), and 91.6 ± 50.17 cm(3), respectively. The mean resting pressure of the puborectalis muscle was 69 ± 14 mm Hg, whereas the mean squeeze pressure was 124 ± 33 mm Hg. There was no statistically significant difference in pressure parameters between age groups. We observed a positive correlation between age and balloon volume needed to elicit discomfort (r = 0.49, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS In a prospective study, we determined normal values from 3DHRAM analysis of children without symptoms arising from the lower gastrointestinal tract.

Potential targets related to matrine, COVID-19 and liver injury were identified from several databases. We constructed PPI network and screened the core targets according to the degree value. Then, GO and KEGG enrichment were carried out. Molecular docking technology was used to verify the affinity between matrine and the crystal structure of core target protein. Finally, real-time RT-PCR was used to detect the effects of matrine on hub gene expression in liver tissue of liver injury mice and lung tissue of lung injury mice to further confirm the results of network pharmacological analysis. The results show that six core targets including AKT1, TP53, TNF, IL6, BCL2L1 and ATM were identified. The potential therapeutic mechanism of matrine on COVID-19 combined with liver injury is closely related to regulate antiviral process, improve immune system and regulate the level of inflammatory factors. Molecular docking showed that matrine could spontaneously bind to the receptor protein and had strong binding force. Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that matrine could significantly reduce the expression of AKT1, TP53, TNF, IL6 and ATM in mice with liver injury or lung injury (P < 0.05), and increase the expression of BCL2L1 to a certain extent (P > 0.05).

While the acute phase of infection is mostly asymptomatic, this virus has the high propensity to establish persistence and in the course of one to several decades liver disease can develop. HCV is a paradigm for the complex interplay between the interferon (IFN) system and viral countermeasures. The virus induces an IFN response within the infected cell and is rather sensitive against the antiviral state triggered by IFNs, yet in most cases HCV persists. Numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) have been reported to suppress HCV replication, but in only a few cases we begin to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying antiviral activity. It is becoming increasingly clear that blockage of viral replication is mediated by the concerted action of multiple ISGs that target different steps of the HCV replication cycle. This review briefly summarizes the activation of the IFN system by HCV and then focuses on ISGs targeting the HCV replication cycle and their possible mode of action.","Metz, Philippe; Reuter, Antje; Bender, Silke; Bartenschlager, Ralf",Journal of hepatology,323,1

Allergological evaluation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to find a tolerated alternative. The aim of this study was to establish the role of skin testing and the drug provocation test (DPT) in the diagnosis of nonimmediate reactions to CM. METHODS Skin intradermal testing and patch testing with delayed readings were carried out with different CM (iobitridol, iomeprol, iodixanol, iohexol, ioversol, iopramide and ioxaglate). Single-blind placebo-controlled DPT was carried out in those cases with a negative skin test. In seven cases, a skin biopsy was obtained from positive skin tests and positive DPT. RESULTS Of the 161 subjects evaluated, 34 (21.1%) were skin-test positive, 21 (50%) to Iomeprol, 7 (16.7%) to Iodixanol, 5 (11.9%) to Iobitridol, 4 (9.5%) to Ioxaglate, 3 (7.1%) to Iohexol and 1 (2.4%) to Iopramide. DPT was positive in 44 cases (34.6%) that were skin-test negative, 38 (76%) to Iodixanol, 8 (16%) to Iomeprol and 4 (8%) to Iohexol. Of 78 cases (48.4%) with confirmed hypersensitivity, 34 (43.6%) were identified by skin testing and 44 (56.4%) by DPT. Skin biopsies showed a perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate, mainly in the dermis, with higher levels of CD4 than CD8 T lymphocytes, with expression of activation markers and skin homing receptors. CONCLUSION Patients with nonimmediate reactions to CM were identified by skin testing in 43.6% and by DPT in 56.4%.

Therefore, a growing number of patients are presenting with recurrent hernias after conventional anterior and laparoscopic repairs have failed. This study reports our experience with single-incision laparoscopic (SIL) intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) repair of these hernias. METHODS Patients referred with two or more recurrences of inguinal hernia underwent SIL-IPOM from November 1, 2009, to June 24, 2014. A 2.5-cm infraumbilical incision was made, and an SIL port was placed intraperitoneally. Modified dissection techniques were used: chopstick and inline dissection, 5.5-mm/52-cm/30° angled laparoscope, and conventional straight dissecting instruments. The peritoneum was incised above the pubic symphysis, and dissection was continued laterally and proximally, raising the inferior flap below the previous extraperitoneal mesh while reducing any direct, indirect, femoral, or cord lipoma before placement of antiadhesive mesh, which was fixed to the pubic ramus, as well as superiorly, with nonabsorbable tacks before the inferior border was fixed with fibrin sealant. The inferior peritoneal flap was then tacked back onto the mesh. RESULTS Nine male patients underwent SIL-IPOM. Their mean age was 53 years and mean body mass index was 26.8 kg/m(2). Mean mesh size was 275 cm(2). Mean operation time was 125 minutes, with a hospital stay of 1 day. The umbilical scar length was 23 mm at the 6-week follow-up. There were no intra-/postoperative complications, port-site hernias, chronic groin pain, or recurrence of the hernia during a mean follow-up of 24 months. CONCLUSION Inguinal hernias recurring after two or more failed conventional anterior and laparoscopic repairs can be safely and efficiently treated with SIL-IPOM.","Tran, Hanh; Tran, Kim; Zajkowska, Marta; Lam, Vincent; Hawthorne, Wayne J",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,323,26

Prior to January 2015, two-thirds of respondents reported performing 1-5 thrombectomies per month (67%), with 31% performing more than 5 per month. Following January 2015, 62% of respondents reported performing more than 5 thrombectomies per month; 45% of respondents reported a higher number of thrombectomies after trial publication. 73% and 80% of respondents indicated that inpatient consultations and hospital to hospital transfers for thrombectomy have increased, respectively. A plurality of respondents reported using A Direct Aspiration First Pass Technique (40%) as the first strategy for revascularization. Most commonly, neurointerventionalists reported using conscious sedation (56%) for anesthesia. 74% of respondents indicated being successful with their primary technique in at least 70% of cases. CONCLUSIONS This survey of predominantly academic SNIS physicians indicates that inpatient consultations, hospital to hospital transfers, and thrombectomy procedural volumes have increased modestly since the publication of the five major stroke trials this year. In addition, many respondents indicated an increase in aggressiveness in pursuing thrombectomy based on selection criteria.","Fargen, Kyle M; Arthur, Adam S; Spiotta, Alejandro M; Lena, Jonathan; Chaudry, Imran; Turner, Raymond D; Turk, Aquilla S",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,323,1

METHODS Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of the proband and her parents. Whole exome sequencing was used to screen pathogenic variant in the proband. Suspected variant was verified by Sanger sequencing. Impact of the variant on the structure and function of protein product was analyzed by using bioinformatic software. RESULTS Sanger sequencing showed that the proband has carried homozygous missense c.1342G>A (p.Gly448Ala) variant of the MCCC2 gene, for which her mother was a heterozygous carrier. The same variant was not detected in her father. The variant was predicted to be pathogenic by PolyPhen-2 and Mutation Taster software, and the site was highly conserved among various species. Based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics standards and guidelines, the c.1342G>A (p.Gly448Ala) variant of MCCC2 gene was predicted to be likely pathogenic(PM2+PP2-PP5). CONCLUSION The homozygous missense variant of the MCCC2 gene c.1342G>A (p.Gly448Ala) probably underlay the molecular pathogenesis of the proband. Genetic testing has confirmed the clinical diagnosis.","Li, Rui; Xu, Zhaojie; Zhao, Ding; Zhang, Yaodong; Xie, Zhenhua; Wang, Chaojie; Zhang, Zhenhua; Song, Jijun",Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,323,7

METHODS REVASCAT randomized 206 patients with anterior circulation proximal arterial occlusion stroke to Solitaire thrombectomy or best medical treatment alone. Patients with established dementia were excluded from enrollment. Cognitive function was assessed in person with Trail Making Test (TMT) Parts A and B at 3 months and 1 year after randomization by an investigator masked to treatment allocation. Test completion within 5 minutes, time of completion (seconds), and number of errors were recorded. RESULTS From November 2012 to December 2014, 206 patients were enrolled in REVASCAT. TMT was assessed in 82 of 84 patients undergoing thrombectomy and 86 of 87 control patients alive at 3 months and in 71 of 79 patients undergoing thrombectomy and 72 of 78 control patients alive at 1 year. Rates of timely TMT-A completion were similar in both treatment arms, although patients undergoing thrombectomy required less time for TMT-A completion and had higher rates of error-free TMT-A performance. Thrombectomy was also associated with a higher probability of timely TMT-B completion (adjusted odds ratio 3.17, 95% confidence interval 1.51-6.66 at 3 months; and adjusted ratio 3.66, 95% confidence interval 1.60-8.35 at 1 year) and shorter time for TMT-B completion. Differences in TMT completion times between treatment arms were significant in patients with good functional outcome but not in those who were functionally dependent (modified Rankin Scale score >2). Poorer cognitive outcomes were significantly associated with larger infarct volume, higher modified Rankin Scale scores, and worse quality of life. CONCLUSIONS Thrombectomy improves TMT performance after stroke, especially among patients who reach good functional recovery. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER NCT01692379.

Researchers have identified PE-degrading bacteria which have been considered as a sustainable alleviation to this crisis. However, the degradation mechanism employed by currently isolated bacteria is unclear and their degradation efficiencies are insufficient. More importantly, there is little research into bacteria capable of degrading PE mulching film to solve ""white"" pollution in agriculture. We determined the PE degradation efficiency of two Pseudomonas, identified by 16S rDNA analysis, and elucidated their potential mechanisms through whole genome sequencing. During an 8-week period, PE mulch lost 5.95 ± 0.03% and 3.62 ± 0.32% of its mass after incubated with P. knackmussii N1-2 and P. aeruginosa RD1-3 strains, respectively. Moreover, considerable pits and wrinkles were observed on PE.The hydrophobicity of PE films also decreased, and new oxygenic functional groups were detected on PE mulch by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR). Complete genome sequencing analysis indicated that two Pseudomonas strains encode genes for enzymes and metabolism pathways involved in PE degradation. The results provide a theoretical basis for further research that investigates the mechanism driving the degradation and metabolism of discarded PE in the environment.","Hou, Lijun; Xi, Jiao; Liu, Jiaxi; Wang, Peiyuan; Xu, Tengqi; Liu, Tingting; Qu, Wenxing; Lin, Yan Bing",Chemosphere,323,17

However, the unrestricted use of APAP develops liver disorders. Hepatotoxicity and liver injury can also be induced by ionizing radiation (IR) during radiotherapy. The data of the current study represents that treatment of rats with either APAP-overdose, or gamma-irradiation (R) induces hepatotoxicity, results in significant increases of the hepatic-enzymes activities (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, LDH, and MDH), as well as enhancement of triglycerides, total cholesterol levels, combined with declines in albumin and total protein contents. An enhancement of the lipid peroxides (malondialdehyde; MDA), and nitric oxide levels along with a decline of reduced glutathione contents and suppression of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities are also observed within the liver tissues of intoxicated animals. TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), miR-802 gene expression, NF-κB, and calcium levels are up-regulated, while Nuclear factor erythroid-related factor-2 (Nrf2), Hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein and gene expressions, as well as, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), NAD(P)H-Quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), and miR-122 gene expressions are down-regulated in the livers of intoxicated animals. All these parameters show significant improvement in R/APAP intoxicated animals. Curcumin pretreatment develops an amelioration of these effects in APAP-overdose, R-exposure, or R/APAP treatments. In conclusion, oral administration of curcumin shows hepatoprotective effects against APAP-overdose induced hepatic damage in normal and gamma-irradiated rats through prospective regulation of the therapeutic targets CYP2E1, Nrf2, and NF-κB, via organizing the miR-122 and miR-802 gene expression.","Eassawy, Mamdouh M T; Salem, Asmaa A; Ismail, Amel F M",Environmental toxicology,323,1

We aimed to determine the size of changes in QoL score during perimenstrual week compared to those during late follicular phase in women suffering from dysmenorrhea with or without premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and also to compare the two groups. METHODS In this observational analytical study, participants were selected purposively from among single students aged 18-30 years, who were residing at university dormitories in Tabriz, Iran, and had moderate or severe dysmenorrhea. They reported quality of their life during the past week using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) at two time points, days 3-4 and 11-12, of their menstrual cycle. RESULTS Among 52 participants with PMS and 64 without PMS, about half reported severe dysmenorrhea. The mean total quality score was significantly lower during perimenstrual week than during late follicular phase in both group with PMS [48 vs 79, mean difference - 31 (95% confidence interval - 37 to - 26)] and group without PMS [56 vs 78, - 1 (- 27 to - 18)]. The score was significantly lower in the group with PMS than in those without PMS during perimenstrual week [- 8 (- 13 to - 2)] but not during late follicular phase [2.1 (- 2.9 to 7.0)].

Although humans are known to exacerbate soil CO2 emissions through land-use change, we know little about the global carbon footprint of invasive species. We predict the soil area disturbed and resulting CO2 emissions from wild pigs (Sus scrofa), a pervasive human-spread vertebrate that uproots soil. We do this using models of wild pig population density, soil damage, and their effect on soil carbon emissions. Our models suggest that wild pigs are uprooting a median area of 36,214 km2 (mean of 123,517 km2 ) in their non-native range, with a 95% prediction interval (PI) of 14,208 km2 -634,238 km2 . This soil disturbance results in median emissions of 4.9 million metric tonnes (MMT) CO2 per year (equivalent to 1.1 million passenger vehicles or 0.4% of annual emissions from land use, land-use change, and forestry; mean of 16.7 MMT) but that it is highly uncertain (95% PI, 0.3-94 MMT CO2 ) due to variability in wild pig density and soil dynamics. This uncertainty points to an urgent need for more research on the contribution of wild pigs to soil damage, not only for the reduction of anthropogenically related carbon emissions, but also for co-benefits to biodiversity and food security that are crucial for sustainable development.","O'Bryan, Christopher J; Patton, Nicholas R; Hone, Jim; Lewis, Jesse S; Berdejo-Espinola, Violeta; Risch, Derek R; Holden, Matthew H; McDonald-Madden, Eve",Global change biology,323,1

However, several preoperative factors and specific intraoperative pitfalls can have a major impact on patient outcomes. METHODS The authors review the current literature and draw upon their own practice experience to highlight key preoperative and perioperative steps for avoiding common pitfalls or ""error traps"" often performed by a surgeon new to this surgical technique. RESULTS We discuss preoperative factors that influence the outcomes of patients undergoing incisional hernia repair. We show how a TAR that preserves the neurovascular bundles supplying the rectus complex and dissection in the correct plane prevents the formation of new, challenging unintended hernia defects and provides for wide prosthetic overlap offering the patient a sustainable repair. Lastly, we highlight key postoperative factors that affect a patient's recovery. CONCLUSIONS Avoidance of surgical error traps combined with technique mastery can lead to the successful repair of challenging abdominal wall defects using the TAR approach.","Kushner, B; Holden, S; Blatnik, J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,323,16

In large clinical trials comparing the NOACs with the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban were at least as effective for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and for treatment of venous thromboembolism, but were associated with less intracranial bleeding. In addition, the NOACs are more convenient to administer than VKAs because they can be given in fixed doses without routine coagulation monitoring. Consequently, the NOACs are now replacing VKAs for these indications, and their use is increasing. Although, as a class, the NOACs have a favourable benefit-risk profile compared with VKAs, choosing among them is complicated because they have not been compared in head-to-head trials. Therefore, selection depends on the results of the individual trials, renal function, the potential for drug-drug interactions and preference for once- or twice-daily dosing. In addition, several 'special situations' were not adequately studied in the dedicated clinical trials. For these situations, knowledge of the unique pharmacological features of the various NOACs and judicious cross-trial comparison can help inform prescription choices. The purpose of this position article is therefore to help clinicians choose the right anticoagulant for the right patient at the right dose by reviewing a variety of special situations not widely studied in clinical trials.","De Caterina, Raffaele; Ageno, Walter; Agnelli, Giancarlo; Chan, Noel C; Diener, Hans-Christoph; Hylek, Elaine; Raskob, Gary E; Siegal, Deborah M; Verheugt, Freek W A; Lip, Gregory Y H; Weitz, Jeffrey I",Thrombosis and haemostasis,323,33

BACKGROUND Measures of histopathologic response to neoadjuvant treatment of esophageal cancer such as Mandard tumor regression grading focus on the effect on the primary tumor. Although lymph node infiltration is of significant prognostic importance, this criterion is mostly not included in the response classifications. METHODS A total of 370 patients (89% males, median age: 61 years) with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (40 Gy, 5-FU, cisplatin) or chemotherapy (MAGIC or FLOT) for cT3, Nx, M0 esophageal adenocarcinoma were included in the analysis. All patients had undergone transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy, with a median of 27 resected lymph nodes and a R0-resection rate of 92%. Histopathologic regression grading differentiated major or minor response according to less or more than 10% vital cells in the primary tumor. The lymph nodes were classified as ypN0 or ypN+. RESULTS From the patients with R0 resection and M0 category, 3 groups with significantly different 5-year survival rates (5-YSR) could be differentiated: 1. Major response and ypN0 (n=100) with 5-YSR of 64% 2. Either major response and ypN+ (n=34) 5-YSR 42% or minor response and ypN0 (n=84) 5-YSR 44%, together 42% 5-YSR 3. Minor response and ypN+ (n=111) and 5-YSR of 18%.

We compared the safety and reliability of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with transcranial Doppler (TCD) for cerebral monitoring. Methods This single-center, retrospective review was conducted on patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) using selective shunt-based TCD or NIRS at Daegu Catholic University Medical Center from November 2009 to June 2016. Postoperative complications were the primary outcome, and the distribution of risk factors between the 2 groups was compared. Results The medical records of 74 patients (45 TCD, 29 NIRS) were reviewed. The demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. One TCD patient died within the 30-day postoperative period. Postoperative stroke (n=4, p=0.15) and neurologic complications (n=10, p=0.005) were only reported in the TCD group. Shunt usage was 44.4% and 10.3% in the TCD and NIRS groups, respectively (p=0.002). Conclusion NIRS-based selective shunting during CEA seems to be safe and reliable for monitoring cerebral perfusion in terms of postoperative stroke and neurologic symptoms.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have shown promise in antagonizing this microorganism in liquid media. However, the ecological relationships differ when cells are forming biofilms. In this work, we propose the use of Lactobacillus biofilms as surface ""conditioners"" to modulate the adhesion of L. monocytogenes. For this, the biofilm formation ability of Lactobacillus fermentum MP26 and Lactobacillus salivarius MP14 (human milk origin), fluorescently labeled by transfer of the mCherry-encoding pRCR12 plasmid, was first evaluated. Then, mature biofilms of these strains transformed with pRCR12 for expressing the fluorescent protein mCherry were used as adhesion substrate for GFP-tagged L. monocytogenes Scott A. The resulting biofilms were studied in terms of cellular population and attached biomass (cells plus matrix). Species distribution inside the biofilm structure was revealed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Although none of the Lactobacillus spp. strains reduced the adhesion of L. monocytogenes Scott A, species interactions seem to interfere with the synthesis of extracellular polymeric substances and species distribution inside the biofilms. In dual-species biofilms, CLSM images revealed that Lactobacillus cells were trapping those of L. monocytogenes Scott A. When surfaces were conditioned with Lactobacillus biofilms, the spatial distribution of L. monocytogenes Scott A cells was species-specific, suggesting these interactions are governing the ultimate biofilm structure. The results here obtained open new possibilities for controlling L. monocytogenes dispersal using these Lactobacillus spp. biofilms as a ""natural"" immobilization way. Whether species interactions could modify the virulence of L. monocytogenes still remains unclear.","Jara, Josué; Pérez-Ramos, Adrián; Del Solar, Gloria; Rodríguez, Juan M; Fernández, Leónides; Orgaz, Belén",International journal of food microbiology,323,1

Delivery systems using absorbable collagen sponge (ACS) and fibrin glue (FG) were also evaluated. METHODS Radius defects were made in 12 New Zealand white rabbits. After autoclaving, the resected bone was reinserted and fixed. The animals were classified into three groups: only AAB reinserted (group 1, control), and AAB and ErhBMP-2 inserted using an ACS (group 2) or FG (group 3) as a carrier. Animals were sacrificed six or 12 weeks after surgery. Specimens were evaluated using radiology and histology. RESULTS Micro-computed tomography images showed the best bony union in group 2 at six and 12 weeks after operation. Quantitative analysis showed all indices except trabecular thickness were the highest in group 2 and the lowest in group 1 at twelve weeks. Histologic results showed the greatest bony union between AAB and radial bone at twelve weeks, indicating the highest degree of engraftment. CONCLUSION ErhBMP-2 increases bony healing when applied on AAB graft sites. In addition, the ACS was reconfirmed as a useful delivery system for ErhBMP-2.","Choi, Eun Joo; Kang, Sang-Hoon; Kwon, Hyun-Jin; Cho, Sung-Won; Kim, Hyung Jun",Maxillofacial plastic and reconstructive surgery,323,19

Damage to coding regions and loss of critical cis-acting signals inevitably impair genome fitness; as a consequence, RNA viruses have evolved a variety of mechanisms to protect their genome integrity. These include mechanisms to promote replicase fidelity, recombination activities that allow exchange of sequences between different RNA templates, and mechanisms to repair the genome termini. In this article, we review examples of these processes from a range of RNA viruses to showcase the diverse approaches that viruses have evolved to maintain their genome sequence integrity, focusing first on mechanisms that viruses use to protect their entire genome, and then concentrating on mechanisms that allow protection of the genome termini, which are especially vulnerable. In addition, we discuss examples in which it might be beneficial for a virus to 'lose' its genomic termini and reduce its replication efficiency.","Barr, John N; Fearns, Rachel",The Journal of general virology,323,15

Pretreatment validation and monitoring of these factors during irradiation are necessary for appropriate VMAT treatment. Recently, a gantry mounted transmission detector ""Delta4 Discover® (D4D)"" was developed to detect errors in delivering doses and dose distribution immediately after treatment. In this study, the performance of D4D was evaluated. Simulation plans, in which the MLC position was displaced by 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 mm from the clinically used original plans, were created for ten patients who received VMAT treatment for prostate cancer. Dose deviation (DD), distance-to-agreement (DTA), and gamma index analysis (GA) for each plan were evaluated by D4D. These results were compared to the results (DD, DTA and GA) measured by Delta4 Phantom + (D4P). We compared the deviations between the planned and measured values of the MLC stop positions A-side and B-side in five clinical cases of prostate VMAT during treatment and measured the GA values. For D4D, when the acceptable errors for DD, DTA, and GA were determined to be ≤3%, ≤2 mm, and ≤3%/2 mm, respectively, the minimum detectable errors in the MLC position were 2.0, 1.5, and 1.5 mm based on DD, DTA, and GA respectively. The corresponding minimum detectable MLC position errors were 2.0, 1.0, and 1.5 mm, respectively, for D4P. The deviation between the planned and measured position of MLC stopping point of prostate VMAT during treatment was stable at an average of -0.09 ± 0.05 mm, and all GA values were above 99.86%. In terms of delivering doses and dose distribution of VMAT, error detectability of D4D was comparable to that of D4P. The transmission-type detector ""D4D"" is thus suitable for detecting delivery errors during irradiation.","Honda, Hirofumi; Tominaga, Masahide; Sasaki, Motoharu; Oita, Masataka; Kanzaki, Hiromitsu; Hamamoto, Yasushi; Ishii, Yoshiaki; Yamamoto, Ryuji; Mochizuki, Teruhito; Kido, Teruhito; Uto, Yoshihiro",Journal of applied clinical medical physics,323,28

A retrospective study was performed to determine the rate of port-site hernias as well as influencing risk factors for developing this complication. METHODS A review of all consecutive patients who underwent SILS over 4 years was conducted using electronic medical records in a multi-specialty integrated healthcare system. Statistical evaluation included descriptive analysis of demographics in addition to bivariate and multivariate analyses of potential risk factors, which were age, gender, BMI, procedure, existing insertion-site hernia, wound infection, tobacco use, steroid use, and diabetes. RESULTS 787 patients who underwent SILS without conversion to open were reviewed. There were 454 cholecystectomies, 189 appendectomies, 72 colectomies, 21 fundoplications, 15 transabdominal inguinal herniorrhaphies, and 36 other surgeries. Cases included 532 (67.6 %) women, and among all patients mean age was 44.65 (±19.05) years and mean BMI of 28.04 (±6). Of these, 50 (6.35 %) patients were documented as developing port-site incisional hernias by a health care provider or by incidental imaging. Of the risk factors analyzed, insertion-site hernia, age, and BMI were significant. Multivariate analysis indicated that both preexisting hernia and BMI were significant risk factors (p value = 0.00212; p value = 0.0307). Morbidly obese patients had the highest incidence of incisional hernias at 18.18 % (p value = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS When selecting patients for SILS, surgeons should consider the presence of an umbilical hernia, increased age and obesity as risk factors for developing a port-site hernia.","Buckley, F P; Vassaur, H E; Jupiter, D C; Crosby, J H; Wheeless, C J; Vassaur, J L",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,323,16

For patients with unresectable tumors, various chemical and thermal ablation modalities have been developed. microwave coagulation therapy (MCT) is one such thermal ablation modality and the purpose of this review is to evaluate the presently available data for MCT and assess the level of evidence to support its clinical use. METHODS This review is limited to published studies in the English literature including at least 30 patients per study with MCT for hepatocellular cancer (HCC) or colorectal hepatic metastasis (CRHM). Patterns of local recurrence, complications and survival outcome of MCT ablation are presented and discussed including assessment of Asian experience using the 2.4GHZ device and American experience using the 914MHZ device. CONCLUSIONS Although randomized controlled trials comparing RFA and MCT for hepatic ablation are lacking, our review (based on level 2 data) supports that MCT may be optimal when larger necrosis zones and/or ablation of multiple lesions are the objectives. The data support that the potential procedural advantage(s) noted for ablation of CRHM and HCC >3cm, is not supported for HCC <3cm; moreover MCT shares with all other ablation modalities a high rate of locoregional recurrence in HCC; likely due to the multicentricity of this disease process.","Boutros, C; Somasundar, P; Garrean, S; Saied, A; Espat, N J",Surgical oncology,323,1

Based on this premise, thermodynamic features of pure, graphene, and carbon nanotube (CNT)-based gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are investigated using molecular dynamics approach. Melting, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, contact angle of molten AuNPs, and phase transition are calculated as indicators of thermodynamic properties of pure and carbon-based AuNPs. Simulation results indicate that the presence of a carbon platform and its contact surface area has a significant role in the thermodynamic properties of AuNPs and leads the phononic heat capacity and thermal conductivity to decrease for AuNPs. The platform also causes the melting point temperature of AuNPs to increase. The melting of gold on the carbon base is of the first-order type. In addition, contact angle for molten AuNPs on the Graphene is significantly higher than the one on the CNT due to more contact area on the Graphene substrate.Graphical abstract .","Gowdini, E; Ahmad, A A; Mabudi, A; Hadipour, N L; Kharazian, B",Journal of molecular modeling,323,1

However, the requirement to remain still inside a noisy, enclosed scanner remains a challenge. Verbal or visual descriptions of the process, and/or practice in MRI simulators are the norm in preparing children. Yet, the factors predictive of successfully obtaining neuroimaging data remain unclear. We examined data from 250 children (6-12 years, 197 males) with autism and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Children completed systematic MRI simulator training aimed to habituate to the scanner environment and minimize head motion. An MRI session comprised multiple structural, resting-state, task and diffusion scans. Of the 201 children passing simulator training and attempting scanning, nearly all (94%) successfully completed the first structural scan in the sequence, and 88% also completed the following functional scan. The number of successful scans decreased as the sequence progressed. Multivariate analyses revealed that age was the strongest predictor of successful scans in the session, with younger children having lower success rates. After age, sensorimotor atypicalities contributed most to prediction. Results provide insights on factors to consider in designing pediatric brain imaging protocols.","Simhal, Anish K; Filho, José O A; Segura, Patricia; Cloud, Jessica; Petkova, Eva; Gallagher, Richard; Castellanos, F Xavier; Colcombe, Stan; Milham, Michael P; Di Martino, Adriana",Developmental cognitive neuroscience,323,1

STUDY DESIGN Randomized crossover study. ANIMALS Ten female Beagles weighing 9.4 ± 1.8 kg. METHODS Dogs were randomized for administration of P or KP in a 1:1 mg mL(-1) ratio for induction and maintenance of TIVA. Baseline temperature, pulse, respiratory rate (fR), noninvasive mean blood pressure (MAP), and hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) were recorded. Dogs were intubated and spontaneously breathed room air. Heart rate (HR), fR, MAP, SpO2, end tidal carbon dioxide tension (Pe'CO2), temperature, and salivation score were recorded every 5 minutes. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed at 10, 30, and 60 minutes, and after recovery. At 60 minutes the infusion was discontinued and total drug administered, time to extubation, and recovery score were recorded. The other treatment was performed 1 week later. RESULTS KP required significantly less propofol for induction (4.0 ± 1.0 mg kg(-1) KP versus 5.3 ±1.1 mg kg(-1) P, p = 0.0285) and maintenance (0.3 ± 0.1 mg kg(-1) minute(-1) KP versus 0.6 ±0.1 mg kg(-1) minute(-1) P, p = 0.0018). Significantly higher HR occurred with KP. Both P and KP caused significantly lower MAP compared to baseline. MAP was significantly higher with KP at several time points. P had minimal effects on respiratory variables, while KP resulted in significant respiratory depression. There were no significant differences in salivation scores, time to extubation, or recovery scores. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Total intravenous anesthesia in healthy dogs with ketamine and propofol in a 1:1 mg mL(-1) combination resulted in significant propofol dose reduction, higher HR, improved MAP, no difference in recovery quality, but more significant respiratory depression compared to propofol alone.","Kennedy, Martin J; Smith, Lesley J",Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia,323,20

We attempted to apply a protocol using teleultrasound which is supported by 5G network, to explore the feasibility of solving the problem of early imaging assessment of COVID-19. Four male patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 were hospitalized in isolation wards in two different cities. Ultrasound specialists, located in two other different cities, carried out the robot-assisted teleultrasound and remote consultation in order to settle the problem of early cardiopulmonary evaluation. Lung ultrasound, brief echocardiography and blood volume assessment were performed. Whenever difficulties of remote manipulation and diagnosis occurred, alternative examination was repeated by specialist from another city, and in sequence remote consultation was conducted immediately to meet the consensus. The ultrasound specialists successfully completed the telerobotic ultrasound. Lung ultrasound indicated signs of pneumonia with varied degrees in all cases, and mild pleural effusion in one case. No abnormalities of cardiac structure and function and blood volume were detected. Remote consultation on the issue of manipulation practice and the diagnosis in one case was conducted. The cardiopulmonary information was delivered to the frontline clinicians immediately for further treatment. The practice of teleultrasound protocol makes early diagnosis and repeated assessment available in isolation ward. Ultrasound specialists can be protected from infection and personal protective equipment can be spared. Quality control can be ensured by remote consultations among doctors. This protocol is worth consideration as a feasible strategy for early imaging assessment in COVID-19 pandemic.","Wu, Shengzheng; Wu, Dudu; Ye, Ruizhong; Li, Keyan; Lu, Yuehua; Xu, Jufen; Xiong, Linfei; Zhao, Yuanyuan; Cui, Ailin; Li, Yaqing; Peng, Chengzhong; Lv, Faqin","IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",323,1

Although a reduction in platelet reactivity and improved clinical outcomes occur when using adjunctive cilostazol with dual antiplatelet therapy, this can lead to an increased risk of hemorrhagic complications. Therefore, our current study examined patients undergoing CAS and evaluated the impact of cilostazol-based dual antiplatelet treatment on the outcomes. METHODS Between 2010 and 2015, 137 consecutive patients underwent CAS. From 2010 to 2011 (period 1), 28 patients underwent CAS in conjunction with aspirin and clopidogrel dual antiplatelet treatment (DAPT). From 2010 to 2013 (period 2), 44 patients underwent a preoperative assessment of their platelet function, with the clopidogrel-resistant patients receiving adjunctive cilostazol in addition to the aspirin and clopidogrel. From 2013 to 2015 (period 3), 65 patients underwent CAS in conjunction with cilostazol and clopidogrel treatment. In all patients, the incidence of new ipsilateral ischemic lesions observed by diffusion-weighted imaging on the day after CAS, and ischemic or hemorrhagic events occurring within 30 days were assessed. RESULTS Clopidogrel resistance was identified in 43% of the patients in period 1, in 16% in period 2, and in 5% in period 3 (P < 0.001). The on-treatment platelet reactivity results indicated that the PRU value during cilostazol-based DAPT was significantly lower than that observed for the standard DAPT (P < 0.05). New ipsilateral ischemic lesions decreased by 9% and 8% in periods 2 and 3, respectively, versus a 25% decrease in period 1 (P = 0.047). However, there were no significant differences noted for any of the hemorrhagic or thromboembolic events. CONCLUSIONS Compared to the standard aspirin and clopidogrel dual antiplatelet therapy, cilostazol-based dual antiplatelet treatment reduces the rate of clopidogrel resistance and suppresses new ischemic lesions without hemorrhagic complications.","Nakagawa, Ichiro; Park, Hun Soo; Wada, Takeshi; Yokoyama, Shohei; Yamada, Syuichi; Motoyama, Yasushi; Kichikawa, Kimihiko; Nakase, Hiroyuki",Neurological research,323,1

Continuous nebulization can influence the delivered tidal volume (V(T)) and lead to significant medication loss during expiration. Ventilators thus provide integrated jet nebulization systems that are synchronized during inspiration and ostensibly keep VT constant. METHODS This was a bench study of systems integrated in the Evita XL, Avea, Galileo, and G5 ventilators. The VT delivered with and without nebulization, the inspiratory synchronization of nebulization, and the aerosol deposition were measured with 2 locations of the nebulizer. RESULTS Changes in V(T) with the nebulizer were below 20 mL and below 10% of set V(T) for all ventilators. Synchronization was good at the beginning of insufflation, but prolonged nebulization was observed with all ventilators at the end of insufflation, until up to 1 s during expiration: 5-80% of nebulization occurred during expiration with significant aerosol loss in the expiratory limb. Synchrony could be improved by (1) reducing gas compression/decompression phenomena proximal to the jet nebulizer and (2) increasing inspiratory time, which reduced the amount of nebulization occurring during expiration. Placing the nebulizer upstream in the inspiratory limb did not affect inspiratory synchrony but allowed reduction of the amount of aerosol lost in the expiratory limb. CONCLUSIONS Jet nebulizer systems integrated in the tested ventilators are reliable in terms of V(T) control. Gas compression in tubing driving gas to the nebulizer delays synchronization and reduces nebulization yield if the nebulizer is placed close to the Y-piece. Increasing inspiratory time with no end-inspiratory pause reduces the expiratory loss of medication if placement of the nebulizer upstream in the inspiratory limb is not feasible.","Ehrmann, Stephan; Lyazidi, Aissam; Louis, Bruno; Isabey, Daniel; Le Pennec, Déborah; Brochard, Laurent; Apiou-Sbirlea, Gabriela",Respiratory care,323,31

The present study examined whether the association between goal orientation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, assessed one month later, was accounted for by ruminative flooding. A sample of 924 psychiatric outpatients (Mage = 39.09 years, SD = 14.82, range = 18 to 84; 61.7% female; 37.0% White) completed self-report and interview measures at baseline and provided information about suicide-related outcomes at one-month follow-up. Goal orientation was positively associated with ruminative flooding, and both goal orientation and ruminative flooding were associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors at one-month follow-up. Controlling for lifetime suicidal thoughts and behaviors, as well as patient age and sexual orientation, ruminative flooding accounted for the relationship between goal orientation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors at one-month follow-up. These findings were especially relevant for individuals with a history of multiple suicide attempts. Overall, this study provided evidence that difficulties with goal orientation may relate to suicidal thoughts and behaviors through intense ruminations perceived as a loss of cognitive control. Interventions that address ruminative thinking and cognitive flexibility may, in turn, assist in reducing emotion dysregulation and managing suicidality among those who struggle with goal orientation.","Rogers, Megan L; Cao, Erjia; Sinclair, Courtney; Galynker, Igor",Behaviour research and therapy,323,7

Recent studies have revealed that the failure of proteostasis with age is triggered by developmental and reproductive cues that repress the activity of proteostasis-related pathways in early adulthood. In Caenorhabditis elegans, reduced mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) function during development can override signals that promote proteostasis collapse in aged tissues. However, it is unclear precisely how these beneficial effects are mediated. Here, we reveal that in response to ETC impairment, the PP2A complex generates a dephosphorylated, mitochondrial stress-specific variant of the transcription factor HSF-1. This results in the selective induction of small heat shock proteins in adulthood, thereby protecting against age-related proteostasis collapse. We propose that mitochondrial signals early in life can protect the aging cytosolic proteome by tailoring HSF-1 activity to preferentially drive the expression of non-ATP-dependent chaperones.","Williams, Rhianna; Laskovs, Mihails; Williams, Rebecca I; Mahadevan, Ananya; Labbadia, John",Developmental cell,323,12

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Six databases, including Medline, EMBASE, and PubMed, from inception to 1 September 2018. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA English language studies investigating accuracy of physical examination, imaging, or non-invasive tests among critically ill patients. The reference standard was ICP of 20 mm Hg or more using invasive ICP monitoring, or intraoperative diagnosis of raised ICP. DATA EXTRACTION Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies tool. Summary estimates were generated using a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) model. RESULTS 40 studies (n=5123) were included. Of physical examination signs, pooled sensitivity and specificity for increased ICP were 28.2% (95% confidence interval 16.0% to 44.8%) and 85.9% (74.9% to 92.5%) for pupillary dilation, respectively; 54.3% (36.6% to 71.0%) and 63.6% (46.5% to 77.8%) for posturing; and 75.8% (62.4% to 85.5%) and 39.9% (26.9% to 54.5%) for Glasgow coma scale of 8 or less. Among CT findings, sensitivity and specificity were 85.9% (58.0% to 96.4%) and 61.0% (29.1% to 85.6%) for compression of basal cisterns, respectively; 80.9% (64.3% to 90.9%) and 42.7% (24.0% to 63.7%) for any midline shift; and 20.7% (13.0% to 31.3%) and 89.2% (77.5% to 95.2%) for midline shift of at least 10 mm. The pooled area under the ROC (AUROC) curve for ONSD sonography was 0.94 (0.91 to 0.96). Patient level data from studies using TCD-PI showed poor performance for detecting raised ICP (AUROC for individual studies ranging from 0.55 to 0.72). CONCLUSIONS Absence of any one physical examination feature is not sufficient to rule out elevated ICP. Substantial midline shift could suggest elevated ICP, but the absence of shift cannot rule it out. ONSD sonography might have use, but further studies are needed. Suspicion of elevated ICP could necessitate treatment and transfer, regardless of individual non-invasive tests.

Nicotine administration significantly increased mitochondrial ROS production and permeability transition relative to the vehicle controls. Interestingly, pre-incubation of isolated mitochondria with ROS scavengers (superoxide dismutase and mitoTEMPO) significantly abolished nicotine-induced increase in mitochondria permeability transition in isolated rat heart mitochondria. Overall, our data showed that prolonged nicotine administration enhances myocardial susceptibility to I/R injury in rats and this is associated with mitochondrial-ROS-driven increase in mitochondrial permeability transition.","Ramalingam, Anand; Mohd Fauzi, Norsyahida; Budin, Siti Balkis; Zainalabidin, Satirah",Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,323,10

This study aims to assess COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) in Latin American children, to appropriately plan and allocate resources to face the pandemic on a local and international level. METHODS Ambispective multicenter cohort study from 5 Latin American countries. Children 18 years of age or younger with microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or fulfilling MIS-C definition were included. FINDINGS Four hundred nine children were included, with a median age of 3.0 years (interquartile range 0.6-9.0). Of these, 95 (23.2%) were diagnosed with MIS-C. One hundred ninety-one (46.7%) children were admitted to hospital and 52 (12.7%) required admission to a pediatric intensive care unit. Ninety-two (22.5%) patients required oxygen support: 8 (2%) were started on continuous positive airway pressure and 29 (7%) on mechanical ventilation. Thirty-five (8.5%) patients required inotropic support. The following factors were associated with pediatric intensive care unit admission: preexisting medical condition (P < 0.0001), immunodeficiency (P = 0.01), lower respiratory tract infection (P < 0.0001), gastrointestinal symptoms (P = 0.006), radiological changes suggestive of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (P < 0.0001) and low socioeconomic conditions (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS This study shows a generally more severe form of COVID-19 and a high number of MIS-C in Latin American children, compared with studies from China, Europe and North America, and support current evidence of a more severe disease in Latin/Hispanic children or in people of lower socioeconomic level. The findings highlight an urgent need for more data on COVID-19 in Latin America.","Antúnez-Montes, Omar Yassef; Escamilla, Maria Isabel; Figueroa-Uribe, Augusto Flavio; Arteaga-Menchaca, Erick; Lavariega-Saráchaga, Manuel; Salcedo-Lozada, Perla; Melchior, Priscilla; de Oliveira, Rodrigo Beréa; Tirado Caballero, Juan Carlos; Redondo, Hernando Pinzon; Montes Fontalvo, Laura Vanessa; Hernandez, Roger; Chavez, Carolina; Campos, Francisco; Uribe, Fadia; Del Aguila, Olguita; Rios Aida, Jorge Alberto; Buitrago, Andrea Parra; Betancur Londoño, Lina Maria; Mendoza Vega, León Felipe; Hernández, Carolina Almeida; Sali, Michela; Higuita Palacio, Julian Esteban; Gomez-Vargas, Jessica; Yock-Corrales, Adriana; Buonsenso, Danilo",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,323,8

Fecal samples were collected monthly, from birth to one year of age, from three healthy children living in a semi-rural village in Mexico. Most of the viral reads were classified into six families of bacteriophages including five dsDNA virus families of the order Caudovirales, with Siphoviridae and Podoviridae being the most abundant. Eukaryotic viruses were detected as early as two weeks after birth and remained present all along the first year of life. Thirty-four different eukaryotic virus families were found, where eight of these families accounted for 98% of all eukaryotic viral reads: Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Genomoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, Reoviridae and the plant-infecting viruses of the Virgaviridae family. Some viruses in these families are known human pathogens, and it is surprising that they were found during the first year of life in infants without gastrointestinal symptoms. The eukaryotic virus species richness found in this work was higher than that observed in previous studies; on average between 7 and 24 virus species were identified per sample. The richness and abundance of the eukaryotic virome significantly increased during the second semester of life, probably because of an increased environmental exposure of infants with age. Our findings suggest an early and permanent contact of infants with a diverse array of bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses, whose composition changes over time. The bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses found in these children could represent a metastable virome, whose potential influence on the development of the infant's immune system or on the health of the infants later in life, remains to be investigated.","Taboada, Blanca; Morán, Patricia; Serrano-Vázquez, Angélica; Iša, Pavel; Rojas-Velázquez, Liliana; Pérez-Juárez, Horacio; López, Susana; Torres, Javier; Ximenez, Cecilia; Arias, Carlos F",PloS one,323,12

We investigated its broader implication. RECENT FINDINGS Since 2020, the cellular therapy module of the EBMT registry captures data to support postauthorization studies for MAHs and EMA. The process toward a positive qualification opinion has attracted interest from many other stakeholders, such as scientists and Health Technology Assessment bodies, and was the spin-off for a stimulating development which defined the need for a registry to comply with regulatory requirements, and also inspired ways to deal with CAR-T cell programs in terms of center qualifications and educational standards for professionals.

The differential diagnosis of cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma is only possible with pathological findings. Therefore, surgical resection is necessary to diagnose suspected CN lesions. Because CN is usually well demarcated and has a good prognosis, partial nephrectomy is recommended for its treatment. However, to our knowledge, laparoscopic treatment of CN has not been reported. We describe 2 cases of large CNs successfully treated: Case 1 was a 9-month-old boy with a lower polar mass in the right kidney, which occupied two-thirds of the kidney, and Case 2 was a 9-month-old boy with an upper polar mass in the left kidney, which occupied three-fourths of the kidney. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using the transperitoneal approach, the lesion was detected by a laparoscopic ultrasound probe, and vessels in the affected region were dissected. After the renal artery was clamped with bulldog clips, the parenchyma of the affected region was divided with an ultrasonically activated scalpel. The partly cut pelvis was closed by suturing, and the resected stump was coated with hemostatic agents and covered with the pediculate peritoneum. RESULTS The lesion was not exposed during surgery, and the microscopic features were consistent with CN in both cases. Residual renal function was good, and no residual tumor was found in both cases for over a year. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is a feasible approach to treat large CNs. When it is difficult to close the resection stump by parenchymal suturing, covering the stump with hemostatic agents and pediculate peritoneum is feasible.","Tanaka, Yujiro; Uchida, Hiroo; Kawashima, Hiroshi; Masuko, Takayuki; Takazawa, Shinya; Deie, Kyoichi; Amano, Hizuru; Iwanaka, Tadashi",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

In the lab, it is typically measured in speed of response to sequential stimuli, whereby faster responses are taken to indicate improved anticipation. However, response speed is an indirect measure of anticipation, that can provide only limited information on underlying processes. As a result, little is known about what is learned during sequence learning, and how that unfolds over time. In this work, eye movements that occurred before targets appeared on screen in an ocular serial reaction time (O-SRT) task provided an online indication of where participants anticipated upcoming targets. When analyzed in the context of the stimuli preceding them, oculomotor anticipations revealed several simultaneous learning processes. These processes influenced each other, as learning the task grammar facilitated acquisition of the target sequence. However, they were dissociable, as the grammar was similarly learned whether a repeating sequence inhabited the task or not. Individual differences were found in how the different learning processes progressed, allowing for similar performance to be produced for different latent reasons. This study provides new insights into the processes subserving sequence learning, and a new method for high-resolution study of it.","Tal, Amir; Bloch, Ayala; Cohen-Dallal, Haggar; Aviv, Or; Schwizer Ashkenazi, Simone; Bar, Moshe; Vakil, Eli",Scientific reports,323,16

The causal agent being SARS-CoV-2, a member of the long-known Coronaviridae family, is a positive sense single-stranded enveloped virus and quite closely related to SARS-CoV. It has become the need of the hour to understand the pathophysiology of this disease, so that drugs, vaccines, treatment regimens and plausible therapeutic agents can be produced. METHODS In this regard, recent studies uncovered the fact that the viral genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes nonstructural proteins like RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which is an important tool for its transcription and replication process. A large number of nucleic acid based anti-viral drugs are being repurposed for treating COVID-19 targeting RdRp. Few of them are in the advanced stage of clinical trials including Remdesivir. While performing close investigation of the large set of nucleic acid based drugs, we were surprised to find that the synthetic nucleic acid backbone is explored very little or rare. RESULTS We have designed scaffolds derived from peptide nucleic acid (PNA) and subjected them for in-silico screening systematically. These designed molecules have demonstrated excellent binding towards RdRp. Compound 12 was found to possess similar binding affinity as Remdesivir with comparable pharmacokinetics. However, the in-silico toxicity prediction indicates compound 12 may be a superior molecule which can be explored further due to its excellent safety-profile with LD50 (12,000mg/kg) as opposed to Remdesivir (LD50 =1000mg/kg). CONCLUSION Compound 12 falls in the safe category of class 6. Synthetic feasibility, equipotent binding and very low toxicity of this peptide nucleic acid derived compounds can serve as a leading scaffold to design, synthesize and evaluate many of similar compounds for the treatment of COVID-19.","Sahu, Bichismita; Behera, Santosh Kumar; Das, Rudradip; Dalvi, Tanay; Chowdhury, Arnab; Dewangan, Bhaskar; Kalia, Kiran; Shard, Amit",Current computer-aided drug design,323,1

METHODS Among 856 patients who underwent CAS between January 2007 and July 2015, 214 (25%) patients (mean age 72±8 years; 154 men) had the procedure via a TR (n=154) or TB (n=60) approach with either Mo.MA proximal protection (n=61) or distal filter protection (n=153). The Mo.MA group (mean age 73±7 years; 54 men) had significantly more men and more severe stenosis than the filter group (mean age 71±8 years; 100 men). Stent type and CAS technique were left to operator discretion. Heparin and a dedicated closure device or bivalirudin and manual compression were used in TR and TB accesses, respectively. Technical and procedure success, crossover to femoral artery, 30-day major adverse cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events (MACCE; death, all strokes, and myocardial infarction), vascular complications, and radiation exposure were compared between groups. RESULTS Crossover to a femoral approach was required in 1/61 (1.6%) Mo.MA patient vs 11/153 (7.1%) filter patients mainly due to technical difficulty in engaging the target vessel. Five Mo.MA patients developed acute intolerance to proximal occlusion; 4 were successfully shifted to filter protection. A TR patient was shifted to filter because the Mo.MA system was too short. CAS was technically successful in the remaining 55 (90%) Mo.MA patients and 142 (93%) filter patients. The MACCE rate was 0% in the Mo.MA patients and 2.8% in the filter group (p=0.18). Radiation exposure was similar between groups. Major vascular complications occurred in 1/61 (1.6%) and in 3/153 (1.96%) patients in the Mo.MA and filter groups (p=0.18), respectively, and were confined to the TB approach in the early part of the learning curve. Chronic radial artery occlusion was detected by Doppler ultrasound in 2/30 (6.6%) Mo.MA patients and in 4/124 (3.2%) filter patients by clinical assessment (p=0.25) at 8.1±7.5-month follow-up. CONCLUSION CAS with proximal protection via a TR or TB approach is a feasible, safe, and effective technique with a low rate of vascular complications.","Montorsi, Piero; Galli, Stefano; Ravagnani, Paolo M; Tresoldi, Simone; Teruzzi, Giovanni; Caputi, Luigi; Trabattoni, Daniela; Fabbiocchi, Franco; Calligaris, Giuseppe; Grancini, Luca; Lualdi, Alessandro; de Martini, Stefano; Bartorelli, Antonio L",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,323,31

The mean National Institute of Health Stroke scale score was 10.1 (3-19). Three patients (23.1%) underwent bridging treatment of intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant plasminogen activator and endovascular thrombectomy. The arithmetic mean onset-to-recanalization time was 696.3 minutes (140-1440) and average operating time was 47.1 minutes (30-80). After treatment, 10 patients (76.9%) underwent revascularization. No operative complications were observed in any case. All patients underwent angiography and were reviewed 7 to 14 days after surgery.

In 2020, hydroxychloroquine (and to a lesser extent chloroquine) also received attention as a possible treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). During investigation for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, concerns for serious adverse events arose. OBJECTIVE We review the toxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine use both short-term and long-term and in overdose. METHODS Medline (via OVID) was searched from its inception through June 7 2020 using the following as either MeSH or keyword terms: (""Chloroquine/"" or ""Hydroxychloroquine/"") AND (""Adverse Drug Event/"" or ""Toxicities, Drug/"" or ""Toxic.mp."" or ""Toxicity.mp."" or ""Overdose.mp.""). We limited resultant articles to those published in English and reporting on Human subjects. This search yielded 330 articles, of which 57 were included. Articles were excluded due to lack of relevance, not reporting desired outcomes, or being duplicative in their content. Twenty-five additional articles were identified through screening references of included articles. To identify toxicities in individuals treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with COVID-19, we searched PubMed on June 10th, 2020: (""Chloroquine"" or ""Hydroxychloroquine"") AND (""Coronavirus"" or ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2""). This search resulted in 638 articles. We reviewed articles for reporting of adverse events or toxicities. Most citations were excluded because they did not include original investigations or extrapolated data from subjects that did not have COVID-19; 34 citations were relevant. For the drug-interactions section, relevant classes and agents were identified through a screen of the https://www.covid19-druginteractions.org/ website. We then conducted targeted searches of PubMed up to June 7th 2020 combining ""chloroquine"" and ""hydroxychloroquine"" with terms for specific drug classes and drugs identified from the drug-interaction site as potentially relevant. We found 29 relevant articles. TOXICITY WITH SHORT-TERM USE Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal toxicities are the most common to occur following initiation of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea account for most reported intolerances. Glucose abnormalities: Alterations in blood glucose concentrations may occur with hydroxychloroquine but are rare with standard therapeutic use. Cardiotoxicity: Short-term use can produce conduction abnormalities. Evidence from COVID-19 treatment suggests QT/QTc prolongation is of concern, particularly when used in combination with azithromycin, although disagreement exists across studies. Dermatologic: Drug eruptions or rashes, followed by cutaneous hyperpigmentation, pruritis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, may occur within days to weeks of exposure but usually resolve with the discontinuation of therapy. Neuropsychiatric: Reported symptoms include confusion, disorientation, and hallucination within 24-48 h of drug initiation. Other toxicities: Hemolysis and anemia may occur in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 was associated with elevation in creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB activities with more events in the higher-dose group. TOXICITY WITH LONG-TERM USE Retinopathy: Retinopathy is the major dose-limiting toxicity associated with long-term use; the risk is higher with increasing age, dose, and duration of usage. Cardiotoxicity: Long-term use has been associated with conduction abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and valvular disorders. Neurotoxicity: Rarely myositis and muscle weakness, extremity weakness, and pseudoparkinsonism have been reported. TOXICITY IN OVERDOSE Symptoms in overdose manifest rapidly (minutes to hours) and cardiotoxicity such as cardiovascular shock and collapse are most prominent. Neurotoxic effects such as psychosis and seizure may also occur. CONCLUSIONS Hydroxychloroquine is a generally well-tolerated medication. Short-term (days to weeks) toxicity includes gastrointestinal effects and rarely glucose abnormalities, dermatologic reactions, and neuropsychiatric events. Cardiotoxicity became of increased concern with its use in COVID-19 patients. Long-term (years) toxicities include retinopathy, neuromyotoxicity, and cardiotoxicity (conduction abnormalities, cardiomyopathy). Deaths from overdoses most often result from cardiovascular collapse.","Doyno, Cassandra; Sobieraj, Diana M; Baker, William L",Clinical toxicology,323,26

This study compared grip strength in paediatric patients with CHD with healthy controls and determined a possible association between grip strength and health-related physical fitness (HRPF). METHODS Grip strength and HRPF were assessed in 569 children (12.4 years, 95% CI 12.16 to 12.72; 238 girls) with various CHD and compared with 2551 healthy controls (11.4 years, 95% CI 11.3 to 11.5; 1424 girls). Grip strength was determined as the maximum value of three repetitions with each hand. HRPF was tested by five motor tasks (FITNESSGRAM) and converted into an SD score (z-score). RESULTS After adjusting for age, sex and weight, children with CHD showed significantly lower grip strength compared with healthy controls (CHD: 20.8 kg, 95% CI 20.4 to 21.2; controls: 24.5 kg, 95% CI 24.3 to 24.8). CHD subgroup analysis also revealed significantly lower grip strength than the controls, with the lowest values in patients with total cavopulmonary connection (19.1, 95% CI 18.0 to 20.2). Children with complex CHD showed the lowest values with 19.19.8 kg (95% CI 19.2 to 20.4), those with moderate 20.7 kg (95% CI 19.9 to 21.4) and those with simple 22.5 kg (95% CI 21.6 to 23.3), respectively. HRPF was also lower (z-score: -0.46, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.35) compared with healthy controls and poorly associated with grip strength (r=0.21). CONCLUSIONS Grip strength is already reduced in children with CHD and poorly associated with HRPF. This suggests that grip strength and HRPF are different domains and have to be assessed separately.","Meyer, Michael; Wang, Yi; Brudy, Leon; Häcker, Anna-Luisa; Schulz, Thorsten; Weberruss, Heidi; Oberhoffer, Renate; Ewert, Peter; Müller, Jan",Archives of disease in childhood,323,11

To evaluate the pandemic's impact and required modifications of radiology medical student courses, the authors developed and administered surveys to Alliance of Medical Student Educators in Radiology (AMSER) faculty and enrolled medical students. The surveys requested feedback and insight about respondents' experiences and innovations. MATERIALS AND METHODS Anonymous twenty-question and seventeen-question surveys about the pandemic's impact on medical student education were distributed via email to AMSER members and medical students. The surveys consisted of multiple choice, ranking, Likert scale, and open-ended questions. Differences in the Likert score agreement was performed using one-sided Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests. Survey data were collected using SurveyMonkey (San Mateo, California). This study was IRB exempt. RESULTS The AMSER survey indicated 96% of institutions cancelled medical student courses and 92% resumed with virtual courses, typically general radiology. A total of 64% of faculty enjoyed online teaching, although 82% preferred on-site courses. A total of 62% of students felt an online radiology course was an excellent alternative to an on-site rotation, although 27% disagreed. A total of 69% of students who completed both on-site and online courses preferred the on-site format.

Most of the work in this area comes from high-income countries, with the remainder from upper-middle income countries, and very little from lower-middle income or low-income countries. Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly poorly represented in this body of literature. Anglo-American concepts are often applied to different jurisdictions without consideration of cultural and societal differences, However, anesthesia providers in this region have unique challenges, with both the highest burden of ""surgical"" disease in the world and the least resources, both in terms of human resources for health and in essential drugs and equipment. The effect of burnout on healthcare systems is also likely to be very different with the current human resources for thehealth crisis in East and Central Africa. According to the Joint Learning Initiative Managing for Performance framework, the three essential factors for building a workforce to effectively support a healthcare system are coverage, competence and motivation. Current efforts to build capacity in anesthesia in East and Southern Africa focus largely on coverage and competence, but neglect motivation at the risk of failing to support a sustainable workforce. In this paper, we include a review of the relevant literature, as well as draw from personal experience living and working in East and Southern Africa, to describe the unique issues surrounding burnout, resilience and wellness in this region.","Workneh, Rediet Shimeles; Tuyishime, Eugene; Mumbwe, Mbangu; Igaga, Elizabeth Namugaya; Bould, M Dylan",Paediatric anaesthesia,323,10

Poliovirus 3AB is a 109-amino acid protein with a natively unstructured N-terminal domain. HeLa cells transduced with 3AB protein displayed intracellular membrane disruption; specifically, the formation of cytoplasmic invaginations.

The detection of VR-2332 of PRRSV type II was successfully accomplished using the enzyme-linked antibody-aptamer sandwich (ELAAS) method. The detection limit of ELAAS was 4.8 × 10(0) TCID(50)/mL that is comparable to some of the previous reports of the PCR-based detection but does not require any complicated equipment or extra costs. Moreover, this ELAAS-based PRRSV detection showed similar sensitivity for both the VR-2332 samples spiked in diluted swine serum and in buffer.

Sleep disordered breathing increases the risk of potentially life-threatening cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic consequences, and therefore should be diagnosed and treated in hospitalized patients. Mitigating the sequelae associated with poor sleep quality and sleep disordered breathing requires early identification of modifiable factors impacting a patient's sleep, including engagement of a multidisciplinary team.

The virus responsible for COVID-19-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-gains entry into host cells via ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). ACE2 is a primary enzyme within the key counter-regulatory pathway of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which acts to oppose the actions of Ang (angiotensin) II by generating Ang-(1-7) to reduce inflammation and fibrosis and mitigate end organ damage. As COVID-19 spans multiple organ systems linked to the cardiovascular system, it is imperative to understand clearly how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may affect the multifaceted RAS. In addition, recognition of the role of ACE2 and the RAS in COVID-19 has renewed interest in its role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease in general. We provide researchers with a framework of best practices in basic and clinical research to interrogate the RAS using appropriate methodology, especially those who are relatively new to the field. This is crucial, as there are many limitations inherent in investigating the RAS in experimental models and in humans. We discuss sound methodological approaches to quantifying enzyme content and activity (ACE, ACE2), peptides (Ang II, Ang-[1-7]), and receptors (types 1 and 2 Ang II receptors, Mas receptor).

AREAS COVERED We searched public databases and major conference proceedings for data on age and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics in PLWH. We limited our review to currently used drugs and focused on population pharmacokinetics and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling studies. EXPERT OPINION Available evidence of a potential detrimental effect in elderly PLWH is limited by study design and small sample sizes. Careful consideration of undoubtful benefits and potential harms is advised when prescribing ARVs to geriatric patients and the knowledge of pharmacokinetics changes need to be included in the process.

The study objective was to assess the safety and clinical outcomes of robotic mitral valve surgery in the first 100 cases performed in our center. METHODS We reviewed the first 100 patients who underwent robotic primary mitral valve repair, including concomitant procedures, from April 2018 to August 2019. The cause of mitral valve disease was degenerative (n = 94), endocarditis (n = 2), functional (n = 2), and other (n = 2). RESULTS There was no in-hospital or 30-day mortality. Mitral valve repair was completed in all patients. Only one patient required conversion to full sternotomy due to left ventricular apex bleeding. In echocardiography performed before hospital discharge, the mitral regurgitation was graded as none or trivial in 94 patients (94%) and mild in 4 (4%). Only two patients required surgical re-intervention due to postoperative hemolysis with moderate mitral regurgitation. For patients who underwent the mitral valve procedure alone, the median times of the total operation, cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic clamping, and console usage were 185, 112, 71, and 60 min, respectively. The learning curve showed that the operation time decreased slightly during the first ten cases and then plateaued at a mean of approximately 180 min. CONCLUSIONS Robotically assisted mitral valve repair was feasible, safe, and therapeutically effective in the first 100 cases, with a minimal learning curve. The robotically assisted approach provides a high-quality surgical view and tremorless suture/cut handling, which will contribute to further development of minimally invasive mitral valve surgery.","Kakuta, Takashi; Fukushima, Satsuki; Shimahara, Yusuke; Yajima, Shin; Tadokoro, Naoki; Minami, Kimito; Kobayashi, Junjiro; Fujita, Tomoyuki",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,323,1

The goal of this review is to develop a consensus view on the human health impacts associated with land-applying biosolids. Pre-existing risk studies are integrated with recent advances in biosolids pathogen exposure science and risk analysis. Other than accidental direct ingestion, the highest public risks of infection from land application are associated with airborne exposure. Multiple, independent risk assessments for enteroviruses similarly estimate the yearly probabilities of infection near 10(-4). However, the inclusion of other emerging pathogens, specifically norovirus, increases this yearly infectious risk by over 2 orders of magnitude. Quantitative microbial risk assessment for biosolids exposure more effectively operates as a tool for analyzing how exposure can be reduced rather than being used to assess ""safety"". Such analysis demonstrates that the tradition of monitoring pathogen quality by Salmonella spp. and enterovirus content underestimates the infectious risk to the public, and that a rigorous biosolids pathogen treatment process, rather than extending community separation distances, is the most efficient method for reducing pathogen exposure and infectious risk.","Viau, Emily; Bibby, Kyle; Paez-Rubio, Tania; Peccia, Jordan",Environmental science & technology,323,31

The purpose of this study is to develop and design an automated carotid plaque characterization and classification system into binary classes, namely symptomatic and asymptomatic types via the deep learning (DL) framework implemented on a supercomputer. We hypothesize that on ultrasound images, symptomatic carotid plaques have (a) a low grayscale median because of a histologically large lipid core and relatively little collagen and calcium, and (b) a higher chaotic (heterogeneous) grayscale distribution due to the composition. The methodology consisted of building a DL model of Artificial Intelligence (called Atheromatic 2.0, AtheroPoint, CA, USA) that used a classic convolution neural network consisting of 13 layers and implemented on a supercomputer. The DL model used a cross-validation protocol for estimating the classification accuracy (ACC) and area-under-the-curve (AUC). A sample of 346 carotid ultrasound-based delineated plaques were used (196 symptomatic and 150 asymptomatic, mean age 69.9 ± 7.8 years, with 39% females). This was augmented using geometric transformation yielding 2312 plaques (1191 symptomatic and 1120 asymptomatic plaques). K10 (90% training and 10% testing) cross-validation DL protocol was implemented and showed an (i) accuracy and (ii) AUC without and with augmentation of 86.17%, 0.86 (p-value < 0.0001), and 89.7%, 0.91 (p-value < 0.0001), respectively. The DL characterization system consisted of validation of the two hypotheses: (a) mean feature strength (MFS) and (b) Mandelbrot's fractal dimension (FD) for measuring chaotic behavior. We demonstrated that both MFS and FD were higher in symptomatic plaques compared to asymptomatic plaques by 64.15 ± 0.73% (p-value < 0.0001) and 6 ± 0.13% (p-value < 0.0001), respectively. The benchmarking results show that DL with augmentation (ACC: 89.7%, AUC: 0.91 (p-value < 0.0001)) is superior to previously published machine learning (ACC: 83.7%) by 6.0%.

Malnutrition was a risk factor for poor outcomes in geriatrics after hip replacement. The purpose of this study was to investigate if oral nutritional supplementation after the procedure in geriatrics with hypoalbuminemia was beneficial for outcomes. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of older (≥ 65 years old) patients suffering femoral neck fracture and undergoing hip replacement with hypoalbuminemia was conducted. Outcomes were compared between patients with and without postoperative nutritional supplementation. RESULTS There were 306 geriatric patients met the criteria. Following adjustment for baseline characteristics, patients with nutritional supplementation showed a lower grade of wound effusion with adjusted OR 0.57 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.36 to 0.91, P < 0.05). And also a lower rate of surgical site infection (5.5% compared with 13.0% [adjusted OR 0.40, 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.91, P < 0.05]), periprosthetic joint infection (2.8% compared with 9.9% [adjusted OR 0.26, 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.79, P < 0.05]), and 30 days readmission (2.1% compared with 8.7% [adjusted OR 0.22, 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.79, P < 0.05]). The average total hospital stay was longer in patients without nutritional supplementation (10.7 ± 2.0 compared with 9.2 ± 1.8 days, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The data suggest that postoperative nutritional supplementation is a protective factor for surgical site infection, periprosthetic joint infection, and 30-days readmission in geriatric with hypoalbuminemia undergoing a hip replacement.

The demand for biosensors for detection of biological warfare agents has increased, and research is focused on ways of producing small portable devices that would allow fast, accurate, and on-site detection. In the past decade, the demand for rapid and accurate on-site detection of plant disease diagnosis has increased due to emerging pathogens with resistance to pesticides, increased human mobility, and regulations limiting the application of toxic chemicals to prevent spread of diseases. The portability of biosensors for on-site diagnosis is limited due to various issues, including sample preparation techniques, fluid-handling techniques, the limited lifetime of biological reagents, device packaging, integrating electronics for data collection/analysis, and the requirement of external accessories and power.

SETTING Cullen Eye Institute, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA. DESIGN Retrospective comparative case series. METHODS Preoperatively, all patients had corneal topography measurements with a color light-emitting diode topographer. The 3-D system used the anterior keratometry values to create an optimized plan for the toric IOL alignment. Intrastromal marks were created by the femtosecond laser at the intended toric meridian, guided by manual ink marks placed at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock limbus with the patient sitting upright. Intraoperatively, the 3-D system was used to align the IOL and measure the angular position of the femtosecond marks relative to the IOL meridian. Three weeks postoperatively, the manifest refraction, corrected distance visual acuity, and toric IOL alignment were recorded. RESULTS The mean 3-D imaging error was -0.58 degrees ± 3.90 (SD) (range -9 to 5 degrees), and the mean manual ink error was -0.27 ± 3.65 degrees (range -8 to 5 degrees); neither was statistically significantly different from zero (P = .28 and P = .76, respectively).

HRN was designed as a conduit for promoting mental health and addressing feelings of grief, worry, and stress experienced during this time. This article provides an overview of the rapid, mixed-method, culturally responsive formative research process undertaken to inform the development of HRN. Specifically, it describes how HRN's disproportionately affected audiences (adults aged 65 and older and their caregivers, adults with preexisting physical and mental health conditions, adults experiencing violence, and adults experiencing economic distress) describe and discuss emotional resilience, what they need to be resilient, and what factors contribute to the perceptions of their ability to ""bounce back"" from the conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection methods included an environmental scan (n &gt;= 700 publications), social listening (n &gt;= 1 million social media posts), partner needs-assessment calls (n = 16), partner-convened listening sessions with community members (n = 29), online focus groups (n = 58), and a national probability survey (n = 731), all in English and Spanish. Results revealed that HRN's audiences have diverse perceptions of what constitutes resilience. However, common factors were identified across populations to support resilience amid the COVID-19 pandemic, including informal and formal social support and access to services to meet basic needs, including food and housing resources. Stress, anxiety, depression, and experience with stigma and discrimination were also linked to resilience. Understanding the perspectives and experiences of disproportionately affected populations is vital to identifying supports and services, including the engagement of community stakeholders.

He described four types of erroneous responses, named as follow: 1) difference error;2) figure repetition error;3) inadequate individuation error: 4) incomplete correlate error. Raven claimed that the qualitative analysis of the pattern of errors could be useful in the analysis of the level of reasoning used during the execution of the test: each error can have a different level of sophistication, the more sophisticated error is the more similar to the correct option (Raven et al., 1995) and each error gives some indication of the processes and the strategies used during the solution of the item(Raven et al., 1990). Moreover, there is a general agreement on the usefulness of qualitative error analysis to collect more information on the reasoning abilities. The present study aims to propose some findings of the assessment of the pattern of errors on Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices in a kindergarten and primary schoolsample and to propose some hints of analysis on the role of the evaluation of types of errors from a clinical point of view. We also discuss about the use of pattern of errors evaluation as a way to gain information about reasoning during intelligence assessment.

Most of them were deeply affected, and their economic growths have not returned to their pre-crisis rates. Moreover, the inflation rate is still very low despite the European Central Bank’s interventions. Twelve years later, a health crisis occurred. The ECB have reacted to this event by using monetary tools. We can cite for example the famous temporary Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) to save the Euro-zone countries from a systemic disaster. The current interest rate is negative, and it seems to raise some questions about the efficiency of policies and the threat to economic, monetary, and financial stability. Negative interest rate may also generate the next crisis. This paper is dedicated to recommendations based on the role of Central Banks in the health crisis management and, more generally, environmental crisis management instead of evaluating the impacts of the monetary policies on Eurozone countries because it is too early to measure with acuity the COVID-19 effects. © 2021, University of National and World Economy.

This study was done to determine the perceptions of medical undergraduates on formative electronic assessments conducted during COVID-19 lockdown and to estimate the mean marks scored in these assessments. Methods: This was a descriptive study done for a period of 3 months on online platform. Six online formative assessments were conducted on Google Forms or Kahoot. A questionnaire was administered as Google Form to collect the perceptions of the participants on perceived ease of use of platform, attitude, and practice adopted in online assessments. Data were analyzed using SPSS 16. Results: The response rate was 97.7%. Kahoot was perceived to be easier with lesser technical glitches and privacy concerns as compared to Google, while it was equivocal in terms of access assessment links, output storage, display clarity, overall user interface, network issues, need for computer literacy, and eyestrain caused. The participants had a positive attitude regarding the usefulness of online assessments however majority liked the traditional assessments more than the online assessments. While less than one-third (22%) had copy pasted some answers, more than half (54.4%) had referred to internet and more than three quarter (79.6%) had referred to textbooks/power points/notes while attending online assessments.

The European Union has taken a number of steps (including the Circular Economy Package of Directives) shaping circularity as a wide-ranging driver measure involving many sectors. The paper intends to provide a regulatory framework on the current general situation regarding circularity in European Union, in order to extrapolate and give evidence to the aspects that intersect the agri-food sector. This is not only because they are poorly addressed in the literature, but also because there is a lack of regulatory instruments on the circular economy specifically addressing this area of interest. For this purpose, the analysis focuses on waste and residue/scrap management issues, recognized by law as by-products and end-of-waste status, as they are covered by circular economy legislation and as they can be applied to the agri-food sector. The latter allow the implementation of circularity strategies in the agri-food sector and, given the numerousness of production chains and the peculiarities of each of them, various regeneration and/or reuse processes of specific resources may be depicted. The intent is to provide useful knowledge on how to implement sustainable waste management, also proposing a concrete case on a by-product of olive oil processing, through which it is possible to highlight how the correct application of regulations favors the adoption of circular economic and management models in the firms involved, as well as informing the relevant economic operators on the possible profiles of legal liability that may arise from insufficient knowledge. Furthermore, this paper delves into the European Green Deal’s Strategy as it enriches the circular economy paradigm with new facets. NextGenerationEU and the National Recovery and Resilience Plan financially support this strategy in the aftermath of the socioeconomic crisis from COVID-19 in the EU Member States. This is in order to achieve the objective of achieving the agro-ecological transition.","Chinnici, Gaetano Giovanni La Via Bracco Salvatore Pecorino Biagio Mario D’Amico",Sustainability,323,16

Crucial to this success is the ability to motivate animals to perform specific behaviors. One successful strategy is to restrict their water intake, rewarding them with water during a behavioral task. However, water restriction requires rigorous monitoring of animals’ health and hydration status and can be challenging for some mice. We present an alternative that allows mice more control over their water intake: free home-cage access to water, made slightly sour by a small amount of citric acid (CA). In a previous study, rats with free access to CA water readily performed a behavioral task for water rewards, although completing fewer trials than under water restriction (Reinagel, 2018). We here extend this approach to mice and confirm its robustness across multiple laboratories. Mice reduced their intake of CA water while maintaining healthy weights. Continuous home-cage access to CA water only subtly impacted their willingness to perform a decision-making task, in which they were rewarded with sweetened water. When free CA water was used instead of water restriction only on weekends, learning and decision-making behavior were unaffected. CA water is thus a promising alternative to water restriction, allowing animals more control over their water intake without interfering with behavioral performance. Significance Statement High-throughput, reliable behavioral training is a key requirement for the use of mice in behavioral and systems neuroscience, but depends crucially on ability to motivate animals to perform specific behaviors. Here, we present an alternative method to commonly used methods of water restriction: free home-cage access to water, made slightly sour by a small amount of citric acid. This non-labor-intensive, low-error option benefits animal health without hindering behavioral training progress. Citric acid water can serve as a reliable and standardized strategy to achieve high quality task behavior, further facilitating the use of mice in high-throughput behavioral studies.","Urai, Anne E; Aguillon-Rodriguez, Valeria; Laranjeira, Inês C; Cazettes, Fanny; Mainen, Zachary F; Churchland, Anne K",bioRxiv,323,14

This article is a timely examination of public audit strategies from national audit offices, assessing whether they are likely to deliver the objectives of the new normal, for example with the increased focus on digital transformation, work methods, communication and collaboration. It also contributes to the now long-standing practice of shared learning by public audit offices around the world. The article includes national audit offices' reactions to the changes needed post Covid-19. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a marked, and continuing, impact on most countries and virtually all sectors of their economies-not least on government and its various institutions. There is international recognition that the `new normal' will require more than some transitional adjustments within and across the various sectors, not least the public sector, but also requires research and analysis by the academic community (Ansell et al., 2021). This article's main focus is on the published strategic intentions for future audits by a selection of national audit offices that have provided the most detail of such intentions. A number of other national audit, or similar, offices/courts was also reviewed to ascertain any marked differences of intentions because of the different impacts of the pandemic and government actions taken. It is not only an examination of those intentions but also of the allied question as to whether/how audit offices have, or are acquiring, the necessary systems and expertise for their effective implementation. Both academics and practitioners will need to address short and longer term frameworks and processes to make a successful transition to the `new normal'. Hopefully, there will be the leadership across sectors to make it happen.","Barrett, A. O. P.",Public Money & Management,323,21

This paper aims to investigate how stimulating guests’ senses through IoT devices influenced their emotions, affective experiences, eudaimonism (well-being), and ultimately, guest behavior. The authors examined the potential moderating effects of gender. Design/methodology/approach: Research conducted comprised an exploratory study, which consisted of interviews with hotel managers (Study 1) and an online confirmatory survey (n = 357) among hotel guests (Study 2). Findings: The results showed that while the senses of smell, hearing and sight had an impact on guests’ emotions, the senses of touch, hearing and sight impacted guests’ affective experiences. The senses of smell and taste influenced guests’ eudaimonism. The sense of smell had a greater effect on eudaimonism and behavioral intentions among women compared to men. Research limitations/implications: This study concentrated on upscale hotels located in Europe. Further research may explore the generalizability of the findings (e.g. in other cultures, comparison between high-end and low-end hotels). Practical implications: Managers of upscale hotels should apply congruent sensory stimuli from all five senses. Stimuli may be customized (“SoCoIoT” marketing). IoT in hotels may be useful in the aftermath of the COVID pandemic, as voice commands help guests avoid touching surfaces. Originality/value: IoT can be applied in creating customized multi-sensory hotel experiences. For example, hotels may offer unique and diverse ambiances in their rooms and suites to improve guest experiences. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Pelet, J.

The neutralizing-antibody response to live virus was maintained up to 180 days after vaccination with RBD-NP in AS03 (RBD-NP-AS03), and correlated with protection from infection. RBD-NP immunization cross-neutralized the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant efficiently but showed a reduced response against the B.1.351 variant. RBD-NP-AS03 produced a 4.5-fold reduction in neutralization of B.1.351 whereas the group immunized with RBD-NP-AS37 produced a 16-fold reduction in neutralization of B.1.351, suggesting differences in the breadth of the neutralizing-antibody response induced by these adjuvants. Furthermore, RBD-NP-AS03 was as immunogenic as a prefusion-stabilized spike immunogen (HexaPro) with AS03 adjuvant. These data highlight the efficacy of the adjuvanted RBD-NP vaccine in promoting protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and have led to phase I/II clinical trials of this vaccine (NCT04742738 and NCT04750343).","Arunachalam, Prabhu S; Walls, Alexandra C; Golden, Nadia; Atyeo, Caroline; Fischinger, Stephanie; Li, Chunfeng; Aye, Pyone; Navarro, Mary Jane; Lai, Lilin; Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Röltgen, Katharina; Rogers, Kenneth; Shirreff, Lisa; Ferrell, Douglas E; Wrenn, Samuel; Pettie, Deleah; Kraft, John C; Miranda, Marcos C; Kepl, Elizabeth; Sydeman, Claire; Brunette, Natalie; Murphy, Michael; Fiala, Brooke; Carter, Lauren; White, Alexander G; Trisal, Meera; Hsieh, Ching-Lin; Russell-Lodrigue, Kasi; Monjure, Christopher; Dufour, Jason; Spencer, Skye; Doyle-Meyers, Lara; Bohm, Rudolph P; Maness, Nicholas J; Roy, Chad; Plante, Jessica A; Plante, Kenneth S; Zhu, Alex; Gorman, Matthew J; Shin, Sally; Shen, Xiaoying; Fontenot, Jane; Gupta, Shakti; O039,; Hagan, Derek T; Van Der Most, Robbert; Rappuoli, Rino; Coffman, Robert L; Novack, David; McLellan, Jason S; Subramaniam, Shankar",Nature (Lond.),323,12

METHODS: We utilized a hospital based prospective data registry. The primary end point was to assess the impact of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, on outcome, length of hospitalization, and time to clinical improvement. We utilized treatment effects with inverse-probability-weighting and Cox proportional hazards models. All analyses accounted for age, gender, race, severity on admission, days from symptoms onset and chronic comorbidities. RESULTS: 36 patients received hydroxychloroquine and were age- and sex-matched to 72 patients with COVID-19 who received supportive care. Compared to supportive care, the use of HCQ did not shorten the time to clinical improvement (+0.23 days; 95% CI: -1.8-2.3 days) nor did it shorten the duration of hospital stay (+0.91 days; 95% CI: -1.1-2.9 days). Additionally, HCQ did not decrease the risk of COVID-19 in-hospital death (aHR 1.67; 95% CI: 0.29-9.36).

Non-urgent elective appointments should be postponed, and remote consultations and digital health solutions promoted. Patients should be empowered to self-manage their conditions safely. Patients, their caregivers and healthcare providers should be directed to assured national or international online resources and specific patient groups. For patients in acute hospital settings, existing emergency guidance on the management of hyper- and hypo-calcaemia should be followed. An approach to osteoporosis management is outlined. IV zoledronic acid infusions can be delayed for 6-9 months during the pandemic. Patients established on denosumab, teriparatide and abaloparatide should continue planned therapy. In the event of supply issues with teriparatide or abaloparatide, pausing this treatment in the short term is likely to be relatively harmless, whereas delaying denosumab may cause an immediate increased risk of fracture.

228664,228664,228664,Performing tracheostomy in intensive care unit - a challenge during COVID-19 pandemic,20.349142,9.334731,2020,"BACKGROUND: Many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are asymptomatic. The prevalence of COVID-19 in orthopaedic populations will vary depending on the time and place where the sampling is performed. The idea that asymptomatic carriers play a role is generalizable but has not been studied in large populations of patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery. We therefore evaluated this topic in one large, metropolitan city in a state that had the ninth-most infections in the United States at the time this study was completed (June 2020). This work was based on a screening and testing protocol that required all patients to be tested for COVID-19 preoperatively. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What is the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in patients planning to undergo orthopaedic surgery in one major city, in order to provide other surgeons with a framework for assessing COVID-19 rates in their healthcare system? (2) How did patients with positive test results for COVID-19 differ in terms of age, sex, and orthopaedic conditions? (3) What proportion of patients had complications treated, and how many patients had a symptomatic COVID-19 infection within 30 days of surgery (recognizing that some may have been missed and so our estimates of event rates will necessarily underestimate the frequency of this event)? METHODS: All adult patients scheduled for surgery at four facilities (two tertiary care hospitals, one orthopaedic specialty hospital, and one ambulatory surgery center) at a single institution in the Philadelphia metropolitan area from April 27, 2020 to June 12, 2020 were included in this study. A total of 1295 patients were screened for symptoms, exposure, temperature, and oxygen saturation via a standardized protocol before surgical scheduling; 1.5% (19 of 1295) were excluded because they had COVID-19 symptoms, exposure, or recent travel based on the initial screening questionnaire, leaving 98.5% (1276 of 1295) who underwent testing for COVID-19 preoperatively. All 1276 patients who passed the initial screening test underwent nasopharyngeal swabbing for COVID-19 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction before surgery. The mean age at the time of testing was 56 ± 16 years, and 53% (672 of 1276) were men. Eighty-seven percent (1106), 8% (103), and 5% (67) were tested via the Roche, Abbott, and Cepheid assays, respectively. All patients undergoing elective surgery were tested via the Roche assay, while those undergoing nonelective surgery received either the Abbott or Cepheid assay, based on availability. Patients with positive test results undergoing elective surgery had their procedures rescheduled, while patients scheduled for nonelective surgery underwent surgery regardless of their test results. Additionally, we reviewed the records of all patients at 30 days postoperatively for emergency room visits, readmissions, and COVID-19-related complications via electronic medical records and surgeon-reported complications. However, we had no method for definitively determining how many patients had complications, emergency department visits, or readmissions outside our system, so our event rate estimates for these endpoints are necessarily best-case estimates. RESULTS: A total of 0.5% (7 of 1276) of the patients tested positive for COVID-19: five via the Roche assay and two via the Abbott assay. Patients with positive test results were younger than those with negative results (39 ± 12 years versus 56 ± 16 years; p = 0.01). With the numbers available, we found no difference in the proportion of patients with positive test results for COVID-19 based on subspecialty area (examining the lowest and highest point estimates, respectively, we observed: trauma surgery [3%; 2 of 68 patients] versus hip and knee [0.3%; 1 of 401 patients], OR 12 [95% CI 1-135]; p = 0.06). No patients with negative preoperative test results for COVID-19 developed a symptomatic COVID-19 infection within 30 days postoperatively. Within 30 days of surgery, 0.9% (11 of 1276) of the patients presented to the emergency room, and 1.3% (16 of 1276) were readmitted for non-COVID-19-related complications. None of the patients with positive test results for COVID-19 preoperatively experienced complications. However, because some were likely treated outside our healthcare system, the actual percentages may be higher. CONCLUSION: Because younger patients are more likely to be asymptomatic carriers of disease, surgeons should emphasize the importance of taking proper precautions to prevent virus exposure preoperatively. Because the rates of COVID-19 infection differ based on city and time, surgeons should monitor the local prevalence of disease to properly advise patients on the risk of COVID-19 exposure. Further investigation is required to assess the prevalence in the orthopaedic population in cities with larger COVID-19 burdens.

Unlike the U.S., where cross-sectional data indicate anxiety and depression symptoms have remained elevated, such symptoms reportedly declined in the U.K., according to analysis of repeated measures from a large-scale longitudinal study. However, nearly 40% of U.K. respondents (those who did not complete multiple follow-up surveys) were excluded from analysis, suggesting that survivorship bias might partially explain this discrepancy. We therefore sought to assess survivorship bias among participants in our longitudinal survey study as part of The COVID-19 Outbreak Public Evaluation (COPE) Initiative. METHODS: Survivorship bias was assessed in 4039 U.S. respondents who completed surveys including the assessment of mental health as part of The COPE Initiative in April 2020 and were invited to complete follow-up surveys. Participants completed validated screening instruments for symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia. Survivorship bias was assessed for (1) demographic differences in follow-up survey participation, (2) differences in initial adverse mental health symptom prevalence adjusted for demographic factors and (3) differences in follow-up survey participation based on mental health experiences adjusted for demographic factors. RESULTS: Adjusting for demographics, individuals who completed only one or two out of four surveys had significantly higher prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in April 2020 (e.g. one-survey v. four-survey, anxiety symptoms, adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]: 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.55, p = 0.0045; depression symptoms, aPR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.17-1.75, p = 0.00052). Moreover, individuals who experienced incident anxiety or depression symptoms had significantly higher adjusted odds of not completing follow-up surveys (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.22-2.31, p = 0.0015, aOR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.15-2.12, p = 0.0046, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal significant survivorship bias among longitudinal survey respondents, indicating that restricting analytic samples to only respondents who provide repeated assessments in longitudinal survey studies could lead to overly optimistic interpretations of mental health trends over time. Cross-sectional or planned missing data designs may provide more accurate estimates of population-level adverse mental health symptom prevalence than longitudinal surveys.","Czeisler, Mark É; Wiley, Joshua F; Czeisler, Charles A; Rajaratnam, Shantha M W; Howard, Mark E",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,323,21

In order to facilitate a full range of services for patients, some states permit advanced practice nurses to practice with full independence. However, many states limit their scopes of practice, resulting in the potential for limited healthcare access in underserved areas. The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily upended these arrangements for several states, as 17 governors quickly passed waivers and suspensions of physician oversight restrictions. ISSUES: Physician resistance is a primary hurdle for states that limit advanced practice nurse scopes of practice. Longstanding restrictions were removed, however, in a short period of time. The pandemic demonstrated that even governors with strong political disagreements agreed on one way that healthcare access could potentially be improved. LESSONS LEARNED: Despite longstanding concerns over patient safety when advanced practice nurses practice with full autonomy, governors quickly removed practice restrictions when faced with a crisis situation. Implied in such behavior are that policymakers were aware of advanced practice nurses' capabilities prior to the pandemic, but chose not to implement full practice authority, and that governors appeared to disagree as to whether to temporarily waive specific restrictions or suspend restrictions entirely, consistent with their political affiliation. We propose more research into understanding whether or not such changes should become permanent.","Feyereisen, Scott; Puro, Neeraj",Rural Remote Health,323,16

We analyzed the resulting mechanical characteristics, biological safety (cell adhesion and viability), surface roughness and resistance to dissolution, before and after the cleaning and disinfection phases. We showed that masks 3D printed with home-grade printing equipment have similar performances compared to the industrial-grade ones, and furthermore we obtained a perfect face fit by customizing their shape. Finally, we developed novel approaches to the additive manufacturing post-processing phases essential to assure human safety in the production of 3D printed custom medical devices.","Foresti, Ruben; Ghezzi, Benedetta; Vettori, Matteo; Bergonzi, Lorenzo; Attolino, Silvia; Rossi, Stefano; Tarabella, Giuseppe; Vurro, Davide; von Zeppelin, Didier; Iannotta, Salvatore; Zappettini, Andrea; Macaluso, Guido Maria; Miragoli, Michele; Maggio, Marcello Giuseppe; Costantino, Cosimo; Selleri, Stefano; Macaluso, Claudio",,323,4

Diagnostic tests for covid-19 fall into two main categories: molecular tests that detect viral RNA, and serological tests that detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a molecular test, has become the gold standard for diagnosis of covid-19; however, this test has many limitations that include potential false negative results, changes in diagnostic accuracy over the disease course, and precarious availability of test materials. Serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative or complement to RT-PCR and other Nucleic acid tests in the diagnosis of acute infection, as some might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care. A clear advantage of these tests over RT-PCR is that they can identify individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, even if they never underwent testing while acutely ill. Many serological tests for covid-19 have become available in a short period, including some marketed for use as rapid, point-of-care tests. The pace of development has, however, exceeded that of rigorous evaluation, and important uncertainty about test accuracy remains.","Sidiq, Zeeshan; Hanif, M.; Dwivedi, Kaushal Kumar; Chopra, K.

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: Letters of recommendation (LORs) are highly regarded components of pharmacy residency applications, as they provide insight into an applicant's character and capabilities. In other medical fields, differences in language have been reported for letters written for female and male applicants; however, data on gender differences in LORs for pharmacy residency applications are currently lacking. METHODS: LORs for applicants to our institution's postgraduate year 1 pharmacy residency program for the 2019-2020 academic year were extracted and processed by a natural language processing service. Words within 18 categories were identified and counted for each LOR. Total was also compared. RESULTS: Of the 473 LORs included for analysis, 320 (67.7%) were written for female applicants and 153 (32.3%) were written for male applicants. Approximately two-thirds of all writers were women for both female and male applicants. In comparing letters for women and men, there was a statistically significant difference in the percentage of LORs that contained terms in categories described as gendered, solitary/reserved, and desire. There was no statistically significant difference in total or in the presence of words in other categories such as grindstone, standout, agentic, or communal. When controlling for grade point average, writer gender, duration that the writer knew the applicant, and the writer's professional position, there were no changes to the statistical findings. CONCLUSION: Letters written for female and male applicants were largely similar with regard to length and word categories utilized. While no clear gender bias was found when evaluating pharmacy residency LORs, writers must continue to assess their implicit biases and how those biases might affect a candidate's application.","Rice, Mikhaila L; Leung, Jonathan G; Mara, Kristin C; Nelson, Sarah",Am. j. health system pharm,323,30

We conducted a seroprevalence survey (SPS) to determine a more comprehensive prevalence of past COVID-19 in Los Angeles County SNF residents and staff members. METHODS: We recruited participants from 24 facilities; participants were requested to submit a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR testing and serum for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All participants were cross-referenced with our surveillance database to identify persons with prior positive SARS-CoV-2 results. RESULTS: From August 18 to September 24, 2020, we enrolled 3,305 participants (1,340 residents and 1,965 staff members). Among 856 residents providing serum, 362 (42%) had current/past SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 346 serology positive residents, 199 (58%) did not have a documented prior positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result.

Methods Assumption-free k-nearest neighbour clustering from the principal component analysis of weekly incidence rates of German counties groups similar spreading behaviour. Different spreading dynamics was analysed by the derivative plots of the temporal evolution of tuples [x(t),x’(t)] of weekly incidence rates and their derivatives. The effectiveness of the different shutdown measures in Germany during the second wave is assessed by the difference of weekly incidences before and after the respective time periods. Findings The implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions of different extents resulted in four distinct time periods of complex, spatially diverse, and age-related spreading patterns during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Clustering gave three regions of coincident spreading characteristics. October 2020 showed a nationwide exponential growth of weekly incidence rates with a doubling time of 10 days. A partial shutdown during November 2020 decreased the overall infection rates by 20–40% with a plateau-like behaviour in northern and southwestern Germany. The eastern parts exhibited a further near-linear growth by 30–80%. Allover the incidence rates among people above 60 years still increased by 15–35% during partial shutdown measures. Only an extended shutdown led to a substantial decrease in incidence rates. These measures decreased the numbers among all age groups and in all regions by 15–45%. This decline until January 2021 was about -1•25 times the October 2020 growth rates with a strong correlation of -0•96. Interpretation Three regional groups with different dynamics and different degrees of effectiveness of the applied measures were identified. The partial shutdown was moderately effective and at most stopped the exponential growth, but the spread remained partly plateau-like and regionally continued to grow in a nearly linear fashion. Only the extended shutdown reversed the linear growth.","Schuppert, Andreas Polotzek Katja Schmitt Jochen Busse Reinhard Karschau Jens Karagiannidis Christian",The Lancet Regional Health - Europe,323,1

The secondary objectives are, to determine the effect of baseline use of ACE-i/ARB on the need for mechanical ventilation, new dialysis, ICU care, and on composite of above-mentioned outcomes in the same cohort. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed data using electronic medical records from all hospitalized Covid-19 African-American patients, who either died in the hospital or survived to discharge between 2 March and 22 May 2020. Patients were divided into two groups, those on ACE-i/ARB at baseline and those not on them. We used Pearson chi-square test for categorical variables, and Student's t test for continuous variables. We performed multiple logistic regression to test the primary and secondary objectives using SAS 9.4. RESULTS: Out of 531 patients included in the analysis, 207 (39%) were on ACE-i/ARB at baseline.

There was no difference in sex, BMI, other comorbidities, and presenting illness severity among the groups. After adjustment of multiple covariates, there was no difference in outcomes between the two groups including mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, new dialysis, ICU care, as well as composite outcomes.

In this study, we have conducted a systematic review of the information available in the literature in order to provide an overview of the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 pandemic in West Africa and of the impact of risk factors such as comorbidities, climatic conditions and demography on the pandemic. Burkina Faso is used as a case study to better describe the situation in West Africa. The epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in West Africa is marked by a continuous increase in the numbers of confirmed cases. This geographic area had on 29 July 2020, 131 049 confirmed cases by polymerase chain reaction, 88 305 recoveries and 2102 deaths. Several factors may influence the SARS-CoV-2 circulation in Africa: (i) comorbidities: diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure could lead to an increase in the number of severe cases of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) climatic factors: the high temperatures could be a factor contributing to slow the spread of the virus and (iii) demography: the West Africa population is very young and this could be a factor limiting the occurrence of severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in West Africa is relatively slow compared to European countries, vigilance must remain. Difficulties in access to diagnostic tests, lack of hospital equipment, but also the large number of people working in the informal sector (such as trading, businesses, transport and restoration) makes it difficult to apply preventive measures, namely physical distancing and containment.","Tinto, B; Salinas, S; Dicko, A; Kagone, T S; Traore, I; de Rekeneire, N; Bicaba, B W; Hien, H; Meda, N; van de Perre, P; Kania, D; Simonin, Y",Epidemiol Infect,323,1

METHODOLOGY: This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted on 87 confirmed COVID-19 patients. The patients were separated into two groups according to the admission in the ICU or in the ward. MIF was determined batchwise in plasma obtained as soon as the patients were admitted. Both groups were compared with respect to demographic characteristics, biochemical parameters and prediction of requirement to ICU admission. RESULTS: Forty seven patients in ICU, and 40 patients in ward were included. With respect to MIF levels and biochemical biomarkers, there was a statistically significant difference between the ICU and ward patients (p< 0.024). In terms of ICU requirement, the cut-off value of MIF was detected as 4.705 (AUC:0.633, 95%CI:0.561-0.79, p= 0.037), D-dimer was 789 (AUC:0.779, 95%CI: 0.681-0.877, p= 0.000), troponin was 8.15 (AUC: 0.820, 95%CI:0.729-0.911, p= 0.000), ferritin was 375 (AUC: 0.774, 95%CI:0.671-0.876, p= 0.000), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 359.5 (AUC:0.843, 95%CI: 0.753-0.933, p= 0.000). According to the logistic regression analysis; when MIF level > 4.705, the patient's requirement to ICU risk was increased to 8.33 (95%CI: 1.73-44.26, p= 0.009) fold. Similarly, elevation of troponin, ferritin and, LDH was shown to predict disease prognosis (p< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that MIF may play a role in inflammatory responses to COVID-19 through induction of pulmonary inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that pharmacotherapeutic approaches targeting MIF may hold promise for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Dheir, Hamad; Yaylaci, Selcuk; Sipahi, Savas; Genc, Ahmed Cihad; Cekic, Deniz; Tuncer, Fatma Betul; Cokluk, Erdem; Kocayigit, Havva; Genc, Ahmed Bilal; Salihi, Salih; Varim, Ceyhun; Karabay, Oguz",J Infect Dev Ctries,323,1

However, best practices remain a challenge in healthcare delivery especially in resource limited situations. The primary objective of this study was to assess the infection prevention and control (IPC) preparedness levels of acute healthcare facilities in Ghana and to determine the factors associated with the overall IPC preparedness levels in acute healthcare facilities. Methods: A cross-sectional study adapting the IPC assessment framework (IPCAF) developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) was conducted. Five of the core components of the WHO IPCAF were used to assess the IPC level of 56 acute healthcare facilities in Ghana. Results: Of the 56 facilities surveyed, only 19 had an IPC program with clearly defined objectives. Overall, 8 (14.3%) facilities scored an IPC preparedness level of ""Advance"", 18 (32.1%) facilities received an ""Intermediate"" IPC preparedness score, 23 (41.1%) facilities received an IPC preparedness level of ""basic"" and 7 (12.5%) facilities scored an IPC preparedness level of ""inadequate"". IPC materials like detergents, running water and PPEs were not significantly supplied. Government owned facilities performed better in terms of IPC preparedness as compared to privately owned facilities. A PLUM-ordinal regression analysis revealed that an IPC program with clearly defined objectives (OR= 76; 95% CI; 7.23, 808.19), dedicated IPC budget (OR= 13; 95% CI; 3.8-44.3) and regular mandatory training (OR= 50.9; 95% CI; 6.1-425) were associated with increased IPC preparedness. Conclusion: Generally, the IPC preparedness levels in a majority of the facilities were low and required significant improvements in several areas. Facilities must make periodic reviews and adjust their objectives based on facility priorities.","Oppong, Timothy Bonney; Amponsem-Boateng, Cecilia; Kyere, Emmanuel Kumi Duodu; Wang, Ying; Gheisari, Zohreh; Oppong, Eunice Ekua; Opolot, Godfrey; Duan, Guangcai; Yang, Haiyan",Infect Drug Resist,323,6

We delineate different kinds of power at play during the COVID-19 crisis, showing how a dearth of compulsory, institutional, and epistemic power undermined global cooperation and fueled the pandemic, with its significant loss to human life and huge economic toll. Through the pandemic response, productive and structural power became apparent, as issue frames stressing security and then preserving livelihoods overwhelmed public health and human rights considerations. Structural power rooted in economic inequalities between and within countries conditioned responses and shaped vulnerabilities, as the crisis threatened to deepen power imbalances along multiple lines. Calls for global health security will surely take on a new urgency in the aftermath of the pandemic and the forms of power delineated here will shape their outcome.","Patterson, Amy; Clark, Mary A",Int. j. health policy manag,323,5

a los casos graves y conocer el comportamiento de la enfermedad por el virus del SARS-CoV-2 (llamada COVID-19) en pediatría, especialmente en las formas severas de presentación en niños La severidad y grado de afectación por el virus en todos los países ha sido muy similar con una mayor gravedad y frecuencia de infección en la población adulta, particularmente en personas mayores de 60 años y con comorbilidades (obesidad, hipertensión, diabetes, entre otros) No obstante, también se ha registrado en la población pediátrica casos graves que requieren intervenciones avanzadas en terapia intensiva, incluyendo una forma de presentación con gran respuesta inflamatoria en niños denominada síndrome inflamatorio multisistémico (MIS-C por sus siglas en inglés) La Asociación Colombiana de Medicina crítica y Cuidados Intensivos (AMCI), convocó un equipo multidisciplinario de expertos en medicina crítica pediátrica para establecer una declaratoria de consenso de buena práctica clínica para la atención de niños con COVID-19 grave que requieran atención en cuidado intermedio o cuidado intensivo pediátrico El objetivo de esta declaración de consenso es facilitar y estandarizar la toma de decisiones en los aspectos más relevantes en la atención y realizar un abordaje integral del paciente pediátrico basado en la mejor evidencia disponible y opinión de expertos en cuidado intensivo pediátrico de al menos 10 años de experiencia de trabajo en el área Adicionalmente se buscó involucrar aquellos Intensivistas Pediatras que deben hacer atención directa de los niños con COVID-19,

adecuada acorde a la mejor literatura disponible A new pandemic was recently declared by the World Health Organisation due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus This virus is characterised by being highly transmissible, lethal, and affecting all age groups This declaration led to the activation, in all countries, of emergency mechanisms to deal with this public health crisis that has exposed the weaknesses of the health systems and the deficit of beds in adult intensive care (UCIA) and paediatric intensive care units (PICU) Colombia has a reduced number of PICU beds compared to other low- and middle-income countries For this reason, we must optimise resources, anticipate severe cases, and understand the behaviour of the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (called COVID-19) in paediatrics, especially in severe forms of presentation in children The severity and degree of involvement by the virus in all countries has been very similar, with a greater severity and frequency of infection in the adult population, particularly in people over 60 years of age, and with comorbidities (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, among others) However, severe cases requiring advanced interventions in intensive care have also been reported in the paediatric population, including a form of presentation with a large inflammatory response in children, called multi-systemic inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) The Colombian Association of Critical Medicine and Intensive Care (AMCI) convened a multidisciplinary team of experts in paediatric critical medicine to establish a consensus statement of good clinical practice for the care of children with severe COVID-19 requiring care in intermediate care or paediatric intensive care The objective of this consensus statement is to facilitate and standardise decision making in the most relevant aspects of care and to carry out a comprehensive approach to the paediatric patient based on the best available evidence and the opinion of experts in paediatric intensive care with at least 10 years of work experience in the area Additionally, it was sought to involve those Paediatric Intensivists who have to directly care for children with COVID-19, and belong to reference or university hospitals and have a proven track record in research and teaching in paediatric critical care This consensus statement will seek to update, as often as necessary, according to the change in the best available evidence, which will enable physicians who care for critical children with COVID-19 to provide comprehensive and adequate

The association between CRF and prostate cancer is controversial. We aimed to assess the prospective association of CRF with prostate cancer risk using a cohort study and review of the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using a respiratory gas exchange analyser during exercise testing in 2204 cancer-free middle-aged men. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs) were estimated. We corrected for within-person variability in CRF levels using repeat measurements. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 24.9 years, 216 prostate cancer cases occurred. The age-adjusted regression dilution ratio of CRF was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.53-0.64). The HR (95% CI) of prostate cancer per 1 standard deviation increase in CRF in age-adjusted analysis was 1.10 (0.95-1.27). The association remained consistent after further adjustment for several risk factors (HR 1.13; 95% CI 0.96-1.33). The corresponding adjusted HRs were 1.24 (95% CI: 0.87-1.77) and 1.28 (95% CI: 0.87-1.88), respectively, when comparing the extreme tertiles of CRF levels. Previous studies mostly reported no evidence of an association or an increased risk of prostate cancer in relation to high CRF. Studies reporting positive associations had short-term follow-up durations (<10 years). CONCLUSIONS: Primary data and a review of previous studies suggest that elevated CRF is not associated with reduced prostate cancer risk. Previous findings of significant evidence of associations could be attributed to increased screening and detection as well as reverse causation bias.","Kunutsor, Setor K; Voutilainen, Ari; Laukkanen, Jari A",Eur J Clin Invest,323,1

The aim of the study was to determine the incidence and predictors of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) among patients with COVID-19 requiring hospital admission. Subjects and Methods. We performed a retrospective study at the Lausanne University Hospital with patients admitted because of COVID-19 from February 28 to April 30, 2020. Results: Among 443 patients with COVID-19, VTE was diagnosed in 41 patients (9.3%; 27 pulmonary embolisms, 12 deep vein thrombosis, one pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, one portal vein thrombosis). VTE was diagnosed already upon admission in 14 (34.1%) patients and 27 (65.9%) during hospital stay (18 in ICU and nine in wards outside the ICU). Multivariate analysis revealed D-dimer value > 3,120 ng/ml (P < 0.001; OR 15.8, 95% CI 4.7-52.9) and duration of 8 days or more from COVID-19 symptoms onset to presentation (P 0.020; OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.3-18.3) to be independently associated with VTE upon admission. D-dimer value &#8805; 3,000 ng/l combined with a Wells score for PE &#8805; 2 was highly specific (sensitivity 57.1%, specificity 91.6%) in detecting VTE upon admission. Development of VTE during hospitalization was independently associated with D-dimer value > 5,611 ng/ml (P < 0.001; OR 6.3, 95% CI 2.4-16.2) and mechanical ventilation (P < 0.001; OR 5.9, 95% CI 2.3-15.1). Conclusions: VTE seems to be a common COVID-19 complication upon admission and during hospitalization, especially in ICU.

Previous studies have observed highly variable alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in patients with COVID-19. However, circulating levels of the cholangiocyte injury biomarker Î³-glutamyltransferase (GGT) have yet to be reported in the existing COVID-19 case studies. Herein, we describe the relationship between GGT levels and clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Our study is a retrospective case series of 98 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Wenzhou Central Hospital in Wenzhou, China, from January 17 to February 5, 2020. Clinical data were collected using a standardized case report form. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was assessed by symptomatology, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and computed tomography (CT) scan. The medical records of patients were analyzed by the research team. Of the 98 patients evaluated, elevated GGT levels were observed in 32.7%; increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and elevated ALT and AST levels were observed in 22.5%, 13.3%, and 20.4%, respectively; and elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and triglycerides (TGs) were found in 2% and 21.4%, respectively.

Then, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried out to explore the binding mode between compounds and 3CL pro. Results and Discussion: A total of 6 candidates with good theoretical binding affinity to 3CL pm were identified. The binding mode after MD shows that hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction play an important role in the binding process. Finally, based on the free binding energy analysis, the candidate natural product Gypenoside LXXV may bind to 3CL pm with high binding affinity. Conclusion: The natural product Gypenoside LXXV may have good potential anti-SARS-COV-2 activity.","He, Q. X.; Chen, X.; Yang, X.; Li, G. P.; Gu, H. Q.; Chu, H.; Lin, Z. H.; Wang, Y.

Non-government organizations and local government units are faced with the challenge of identifying, assessing, and monitoring rapidly growing migrant communities in order to provide urgent humanitarian aid. However, with many of these displaced populations living in informal settlements areas across the country, locating migrant settlements across large territories can be a major challenge. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach for rapidly and cost-effectively locating new and emerging informal settlements using machine learning and publicly accessible Sentinel-2 time-series satellite imagery. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in identifying potential Venezuelan migrant settlements in Colombia that have emerged between 2015 to 2020. Finally, we emphasize the importance of post-classification verification and present a two-step validation approach consisting of (1) remote validation using Google Earth and (2) on-the-ground validation through the Premise App, a mobile crowdsourcing platform.","Tingzon, Isabelle; Dejito, Niccolo; Flores, Ren Avell; Guzman, Rodolfo De; Carvajal, Liliana; Erazo, Katerine Zapata; Cala, Ivan Enrique Contreras; Villaveces, Jeffrey; Rubio, Daniela; Ghani, Rayid",,323,24

To provide guidance for these decisions, we developed an agent-based network model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to assess the potential impact of strategies to reduce outbreaks. The model incorporates important features related to risk at the University of California San Diego. We found that structural interventions for housing (singles only) and instructional changes (from in-person to hybrid with class size caps) can substantially reduce R0, but masking and social distancing are required to reduce this to at or below 1. Within a risk mitigation scenario, increased frequency of asymptomatic testing from monthly to twice weekly has minimal impact on average outbreak size (1.1-1.9), but substantially reduces the maximum outbreak size and cumulative number of cases. We conclude that an interdependent approach incorporating risk mitigation, viral detection, and public health intervention is required to mitigate risk.","Goyal, Ravi; Hotchkiss, John; Schooley, Robert T; De Gruttola, Victor; Martin, Natasha K",Clin. infect. dis,323,1

Here, we examined Mtb lipid-induced response in murine macrophage, as well as in human T-cell subpopulations in order to gain an insight into how changes in cell wall lipid composition may modulate host immune response. Relative to WT Mtb cell wall lipids, the non-polar lipid extracts from &#916;mce1 enhanced the mRNA expression of lipid-sense nuclear receptors TR4 and PPAR-Î³ and dampened the macrophage expression of genes encoding TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and IL-1ß.

Conversely, compared to WT, stimulation with &#916;mce1 lipids induced higher mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in IL-10-producing DN T cells. Mononuclear cells from TB patients stimulated with WT Mtb lipids induced an increased production of TNF-&#945; by CD8+ lymphocytes.

Method: A questionnaire survey was created mainly from existing, validated scales and translated into 12 languages. The data was analyzed using non-parametric inferential statistics and structural equation modeling. Results: The questionnaire received 2225 usable responses from 53 countries. Factor analysis supported the validity of the scales and the structural model achieved a good fit (CFI = 0.961, RMSEA = 0.051, SRMR = 0.067). Confirmatory results include: (1) the pandemic has had a negative effect on developers' wellbeing and productivity; (2) productivity and wellbeing are closely related; (3) disaster preparedness, fear related to the pandemic and home office ergonomics all affect wellbeing or productivity. Exploratory analysis suggests that: (1) women, parents and people with disabilities may be disproportionately affected; (2) different people need different kinds of support.

METHODS: Sixty subjects recovering from symptomatic COVID-19 were included. One group of 30 followed a standard recovery management while 30 comparable subjects received a supplement of 150 mg Pycnogenol® daily (in 3 doses of 50 mg) in addition to standard management. RESULTS: Two groups of selected subjects were comparable at baseline. The groups progressively improved both with the SM (standard management) and with the SM in combination with the supplement. Patients, supplemented with Pycnogenol® showed significantly better improvement compared to the control group patients. No side effects from the supplementation were observed; tolerability was optimal. The progressive evolution over time was visible in all target measurements. Physiological tests. Endothelial function, low in all subjects at inclusion was assessed by flow mediated dilation (FMD) and finger reactive hyperemia in the microcirculation (laser Doppler measurements) after the release of an occluding suprasystolic cuff). It was significantly improved in the Pycnogenol® group after one month and after 3 months (p<0.05 vs controls). The rate of ankle swelling (RAS) by strain gauge decreased significantly in the supplemented group (p<0.05) in comparison with controls showing an improvement of the capillary filtration rate. At inclusion, the kidney cortical flow velocity indicated a decrease in perfusion (lower systolic and diastolic flow velocity) in all patients. Kidney cortical flow velocity increased significantly with the supplement (p<0.05) in comparison with controls with improvement in systolic velocity and in diastolic component. High sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and Il-6 plasma levels decreased progressively over 3 months with a significant more pronounced decrease in the supplement group (p<0.05). The number of patients with normal plasma IL-6 levels at the end of the study was higher (p<0,05) with the supplement. ESR followed the same pattern with a progressive and a more significant decrease in the supplemented subjects (p<0.02). Oxidative stress decreased significantly in the supplemented group (p<0.05) compared with the control group. Blood pressure and heart rate were normalized in all subjects in the supplement group; systolic pressure was significantly lower in the supplemented group (p<0,05) at the end of the study. Finally, the scores of Quality-of-life, mood and fatigue questionnaire and the Karnofsky scale performance index significantly improved in the supplement group (p<0.05) compared to controls after 1 and 3 months.

Data on the COVID-19 epidemic that were analyzed in this study were obtained from the official websites of the National Health Commission of China and the Health Commissions of 31 provinces in China. From January 26 to February 25, 2020, the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in each region was counted daily using data from our database. Curve fitting of daily scatter plots of the relationship between epidemic growth rate (GR) with average temperature (AT) and average relative humidity (ARH) was conducted using the loess method. The heterogeneity across days and provinces was calculated to assess the necessity of using a longitudinal model. Fixed-effect models with polynomial terms were developed to quantify the relationship between variations in the GR and AT or ARH. An increased AT markedly reduced the GR when the AT was lower than -5°C, the GR was moderately reduced when the AT ranged from -5°C to 15°C, and the GR increased when the AT exceeded 15°C. ARH increased the GR when it was less than 72% and reduced the GR when it exceeded 72%. The temperature and relative humidity curves were not linearly associated with the GR of COVID-19. The GR was moderately reduced when the AT ranged from -5°C to 15°C. When the AT was lower or higher than -5°C to 15°C, the GR of COVID-19 increased.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg, or 4.5 mg for 52 weeks. The primary objective was determining superiority of dulaglutide 3.0 mg and/or 4.5 mg over 1.5 mg in HbA1c reduction at 36 weeks. Secondary superiority objectives included change in body weight. Two estimands addressed efficacy objectives: treatment regimen (regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue medication) and efficacy (on treatment without rescue medication) in all randomly assigned patients. RESULTS: Mean baseline HbA1c and BMI in randomly assigned patients (N = 1,842) was 8.6% (70 mmol/mol) and 34.2 kg/m2, respectively. At 36 weeks, dulaglutide 4.5 mg provided superior HbA1c reductions compared with 1.5 mg (treatment-regimen estimand: -1.77 vs. -1.54% [-19.4 vs. -16.8 mmol/mol], estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.24% (-2.6 mmol/mol), P < 0.001; efficacy estimand: -1.87 vs. -1.53% [-20.4 vs. -16.7 mmol/mol], ETD -0.34% (-3.7 mmol/mol), P < 0.001). Dulaglutide 3.0 mg was superior to 1.5 mg for reducing HbA1c, using the efficacy estimand (ETD -0.17% [-1.9 mmol/mol]; P = 0.003) but not the treatment-regimen estimand (ETD -0.10% [-1.1 mmol/mol]; P = 0.096). Dulaglutide 4.5 mg was superior to 1.5 mg for weight loss at 36 weeks for both estimands (treatment regimen: -4.6 vs. -3.0 kg, ETD -1.6 kg, P < 0.001; efficacy: -4.7 vs. -3.1 kg, ETD -1.6 kg, P < 0.001). Common adverse events through 36 weeks included nausea (1.5 mg, 13.4%; 3 mg, 15.6%; 4.5 mg, 16.4%) and vomiting (1.5 mg, 5.6%; 3 mg, 8.3%; 4.5 mg, 9.3%).

These high doses can result in high systemic toxicity if there is a drug leak from the isolated circulation of the limb to the systemic. This makes it imperative to monitor the leakage rate (F[%]) during the infusion, currently performed with radiotracers. The objective of this work was to develop a leakage monitoring protocol as accurate as possible to ensure safe ILP. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We built a phantom with 3compartments (body, limb and precordial area) and a high sensitivity collimator fitted to a portable gammacamera. We simulate ILP with scheduled leaks every 10minutes from 1% to 9% (theorical F[%]). We mesured F(%) using 2equation: one is the proposed in the literature and another corrected by decay of the radioisotope. We test the optimal radiopharmaceutical doses to minimize the detector dead time error and compare F(%) mesured by both equations regarding the theoretical F(%). The leakage monitoring protocol was used in 17 ILP of 16 patients and an analysis of the recorded data was performed. RESULTS: We found significant differences between F(%) mesured using the first equation and theoretical F(%), obtaining results very adjusted to the theorical after applying the decay correction. CONCLUSIONS: The decay correction of the radioisotope is a simple manner to carry out the procedure more safely, reducing the error in the calculation of F(%).","Agudo Martínez, A; Calvo Morón, C; Cambil Molina, T; García Gómez, F J; de la Riva Pérez, P A; de la Cruz Merino, L; Araji Tiliani, O; Terrón León, J A; Castro Montaño, J",Rev. esp. med. nucl. imagen mol.

OBJECTIVES: To describe clinical features and outcome of COVID-19 in patients older than 85 years and study risk factors for mortality. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Patients aged 85 years and older, admitted in noncritical care units at the University Hospital Lariboisière Fernand-Widal (Paris, France) for confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were included and followed up for 21 days. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical and laboratory findings were collected. Cox survival analysis was performed to explore factors associated with death. RESULTS: From March 14 to April 11, 2020, 76 patients (median age = 90 (86-92) years; women = 55.3%) were admitted for confirmed COVID-19. Of the patients, 64.5% presented with three or more comorbidities. Most common symptoms were asthenia (76.3%), fever (75.0%) and confusion and delirium (71.1%). An initial fall was reported in 25.0% of cases, and digestive symptoms were reported in 22.4% of cases. COVID-19 was severe in 51.3% of cases, moderate in 32.9%, and mild in 15.8%. Complications included acute respiratory syndrome (28.9%), cardiac decompensation (14.5%), and hypotensive shock (9.0%). Fatality at 21 days was 28.9%, after a median course of disease of 13 (8-17) days. Males were overrepresented in nonsurvivors (68.2%). In survivors, median length of stay was 12 (9-19.5) days. Independent predictive factors of death were C-reactive protein level at admission and lymphocyte count at nadir.

We showed that random processes defined by this model can capture the essence of the stochastic, often erratic, behavior of the infection process. The most significant finding was that it is negative binomial distributed with small r, hence it is geometrically distributed with an exceedingly long tail. This leads to a much larger disparity in the epidemic patterns than has been known to the modeling community. In Part 2 we conduct simulation experiments by implementing an event-driven simulator. Several independent runs are presented to verify the findings reported in Part 1. The enormous variations among the sample paths obtained from several consecutive and independent runs with statistically identical conditions confirm our analysis. Note that the epidemic pattern that we observe is merely one sample path taken out of infinitely many paths. Thus, one such path cannot represent the ensemble of the underlying random process. By plotting the simulation runs in the semi-log scale, we can see that the probabilistic chances in the early phase of the infection process determine the behavior of the process. Once the process has reached a considerable number, the weak law of large numbers sets in, and the process behaves less erratically than in the early phase. One important implication of our findings is that it would be a futile effort to attempt to identify all plausible causes of the epidemic patterns. Mere luck may play a more significant role than most people believe. It would be worth remarking that the BDI process might be applicable to explain the disparity in wealth among individuals of similar earning power, expenditure, and investment portfolio.","Kobayashi, Hisashi",,323,16

Although the number of MIS-C reports is increasing, rare reports in Asia is still available. To our knowledge, this study is the largest series of published MIS-C cases in Iran. We performed a retrospective study of all patients with case definition for MIS-C admitted to the three paediatric hospitals in Iran. All of these hospitals are located within the most active COVID-19 pandemic areas (Tehran, Qom and Mazandaran) in Iran. Demographic characteristics, clinical data, laboratory findings, imaging and echocardiographic findings, treatment and outcomes were collected. Between 7 March and 23 June 2020, 45 children were included in the study. The median age of children was 7 years (range between 10 months and 17 years).

Apart from their scientific merit, these models are often used to inform political decisions and interventional measures during an ongoing outbreak. Since high-fidelity models are often quite complex and analytically intractable, their applicability to real data depends on powerful estimation algorithms. Moreover, uncertainty quantification in such models is far from trivial, and different types of uncertainty are often confounded. With this work, we introduce a novel coupling between epidemiological models and specialized neural network architectures. This coupling results in a powerful Bayesian inference framework capable of principled uncertainty quantification and efficient amortized inference once the networks have been trained on simulations from an arbitrarily complex model.

Although numbers of approaches have been proposed for this problem, most of which only consider mutual neighbors when aligning the cells without taking into account known cell type annotations. RESULTS: In this work, we present MAT2 that aligns cells in the manifold space with a deep neural network employing contrastive learning strategy. Compared with other manifold-based approaches, MAT2 has two-fold advantages. Firstly, with cell triplets defined based on known cell type annotations, the consensus manifold yielded by the alignment procedure is more robust especially for datasets with limited common cell types. Secondly, the batch-effect-free gene expression reconstructed by MAT2 can better help annotate cell types. Benchmarking results on real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that MAT2 outperforms existing popular methods. Moreover, with MAT2, the hematopoietic stem cells are found to differentiate at different paces between human and mouse.

In the absence of effective antiviral and limited medical resources, many measures are recommended by WHO to control the infection rate and avoid exhausting the limited medical resources. Wearing a mask is among the non-pharmaceutical intervention measures that can be used to cut the primary source of SARS-CoV2 droplets expelled by an infected individual. Regardless of discourse on medical resources and diversities in masks, all countries are mandating coverings over the nose and mouth in public. To contribute towards communal health, this paper aims to devise a highly accurate and real-time technique that can efficiently detect non-mask faces in public and thus, enforcing to wear mask. The proposed technique is ensemble of one-stage and two-stage detectors to achieve low inference time and high accuracy. We start with ResNet50 as a baseline and applied the concept of transfer learning to fuse high-level semantic information in multiple feature maps. In addition, we also propose a bounding box transformation to improve localization performance during mask detection. The experiment is conducted with three popular baseline models viz. ResNet50, AlexNet and MobileNet. We explored the possibility of these models to plug-in with the proposed model so that highly accurate results can be achieved in less inference time. It is observed that the proposed technique achieves high accuracy (98.2%) when implemented with ResNet50. Besides, the proposed model generates 11.07% and 6.44% higher precision and recall in mask detection when compared to the recent public baseline model published as RetinaFaceMask detector. The outstanding performance of the proposed model is highly suitable for video surveillance devices.","Sethi, Shilpa; Kathuria, Mamta; Kaushik, Trilok",J Biomed Inform,323,16

In general, it happens that the real estate sector often experiences complexities in case of project completion, scheduling, and financing. The planned work cannot be carried out due to the non-availability of sufficient numbers of skilled labours and staff. Moreover due to effects of pandemic real estate sectors and the work-life of real estate professionals are being hampered. It is very much obvious that human resources act as the lifeline of any organization and they need to be handled and managed with the utmost care and dignity. Despite the physical, technological and financial resources in the business, human resource is such a critical asset that employers should take care of their quality of work-life all the time, not only during the crisis period. By satisfying them the business can achieve its objectives in terms of revenue and recognition. After a strict lockdown when things return to new normal and employees return to work, the company needs to take certain 'human resource' perspectives for maintaining a good quality of work life. All the employers should implement some strategies concerning to qualitative work life of the employees during this epidemic situation. The real estate sector is labour intensive and employees are a very critical resource that helps to increase productivity and enhancing competitiveness in the market. The impact of the pandemic on the quality of work-life among real estate employees in Kolkata, India is also studied.","Majumder, Soumi; Biswas, Debasish",Qual Quant,323,24

The purpose of this study is to estimate the frequency of vaccine refusal against COVID-19 vaccines and to identify the underlying factors for refusal or hesitation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study carried out in a district of Istanbul from 25 to 30 December 2020. A sample of people from the ages of 20 to 85 in the district was selected, and a total of 384 people were enrolled. A questionnaire about the COVID-19 vaccine was administered to the participants by phone. The questionnaire consisted of questions about the sociodemographic characteristics of participants and their thoughts about possible COVID-19 vaccines. RESULTS: 45.3% of the participants were hesitant about getting the COVID-19 vaccine, which was declared appropriate by the Ministry of Health. The rate of those who think that the COVID-19 vaccine will be effective in preventing and controlling the disease was 51.6%. 89.6% of the participants were hesitant about getting their children vaccinated. Those who do not consider COVID-19 disease as a risk to their health were 22.9%, and 32.8% thought that they would be protected from the disease by natural and traditional ways. The median score of the participants' risk perception was 7 (IQR: 6-8; Mean: 6.8; SD: 1.7). The median value of risk perception score of those who accept the vaccine was 6 (IQR: 4-6), while the median value for those who did not accept the vaccine was 4 (IQR: 4-6) (P < .01). Factors affecting vaccine acceptance were determined as the perception of risk (OR: 1.26% 95CI 1.03-1.55) and age (OR: 0.94% 95CI: 0.91-0.98) in logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: Half of the participants were hesitant about the COVID-19 vaccines. The success of COVID-19 vaccination programmes largely depends on the public willingness to accept the vaccine.","Ikiisik, Hatice; Akif Sezerol, Mehmet; Tasçi, Yusuf; Maral, Isil",Int J Clin Pract,323,22

We compared the performance of the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2â¯S1/S2 IgG tests. The seroconversion panel comprised of 120 samples from 13 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. For the sensitivity and specificity testing, samples from COVID-19 outpatients >15â¯days after positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) result (nâ¯=â¯35) and serum control samples collected before the COVID-19 era (nâ¯=â¯161) were included in the material. Samples for the detection of possible cross-reactions were also tested. Based on our results, the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be quite reliably detected 2â¯weeks after NAAT positivity and 3â¯weeks after the symptom onset with both tests. However, since some COVID-19 patients were positive only with Elecsys®, the antibodies should be screened against N-antigen (Elecsys®) and reactive samples confirmed with S antigen (LIAISON®), but both results should be reported.

Detailed clinical analyses of multi-cultural hospitalized patient cohorts remain largely undescribed. METHODS: We performed regression, survival and cumulative competing risk analyses to evaluate factors associated with mortality in patients admitted for COVID-19 in three large London hospitals between February 25 and April 5, censored as of May 1, 2020. RESULTS: Of 614 patients (median age 69 years, (IQR 25) and 62% male), 381 (62%) had been discharged alive, 178 (29%) died and 55 (9%) remained hospitalized at censoring. Severe hypoxemia (aOR 4.25, 95%CI 2.36-7.64), leukocytosis (aOR 2.35, 95%CI 1.35-4.11), thrombocytopenia (aOR 1.01, 95%CI 1.00-1.01, increase per 10x9 decrease), severe renal impairment (aOR 5.14, 95%CI 2.65-9.97), and low albumin (aOR 1.06, 95%CI 1.02-1.09, increase per g decrease) were associated with death. Forty percent (244) were from black, Asian and other minority ethnic (BAME) groups, 38% (235) white and for 22% (135) ethnicity was unknown. BAME patients were younger and had fewer comorbidities. Whilst the unadjusted odds of death did not differ by ethnicity, when adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities, black patients were at higher odds of death compared to whites (aOR 1.69, 95%CI 1.00-2.86). This association was stronger when further adjusting for admission severity (aOR 1.85 95% CI 1.06-3.24). CONCLUSIONS: BAME patients were over-represented in our cohort and, when accounting for demographic and clinical profile of admission, black patients were at increased odds of death.

A plethora of consensus statements, guidelines, and recommendations on surgical management in the course of COVID-19 epidemic have been rapidly published in the last three months. METHODS: Each manuscript was scored on a seven-point scale in the different items and domains with the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II. RESULTS: Nine guidelines that met the inclusion criteria were assessed. Transnational cooperation produced only one guideline. Multivariable analysis showed that improved scores of stakeholders' involvement were related to internationally developed guidelines. Clarity of presentation was related to the contribution of scientific societies due to greater rigor of development. The rigor of development produced guidelines with a high overall value. Higher healthcare expenses did not produce superior guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluated by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II, the methodological characteristic of consensus statements, guidelines, and recommendations on surgical management during COVID-19 pandemic was relatively low.

It is necessary to achieve high COVID-19 vaccination acceptance rates and medical students' coverage as future health care providers. The study aimed to explore the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and determine the factors and barriers that may affect vaccination decision-making. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among medical students in Tanta and Kafrelsheikh Universities, Egypt. Data collection was done via an online questionnaire during January 2021 from 2133 students. RESULTS: The majority of the participant students (90.5%) perceived the importance of the COVID-19 vaccine, 46% had vaccination hesitancy, and an equal percentage (6%) either definitely accepted or refused the vaccine. Most of the students had concerns regarding the vaccine's adverse effects (96.8%) and ineffectiveness (93.2%). The most confirmed barriers of COVID-19 vaccination were deficient data regarding the vaccine's adverse effects (potential 74.17% and unknown 56.31%) and insufficient information regarding the vaccine itself (72.76%). CONCLUSION: The government, health authority decision-makers, medical experts, and universities in Egypt need to work together and make efforts to reduce hesitancy and raise awareness about vaccinations, consequently improving the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.","Saied, Shimaa M; Saied, Eman M; Kabbash, Ibrahim Ali; Abdo, Sanaa Abd El-Fatah",J Med Virol,323,26

No early imaging biomarkers currently differentiate these disorders. METHODS: Simple visual imaging analysis of the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus in neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging and nigrosome 1 in susceptibility-weighted sequences was performed in thirty patients with parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy fulfilling possible/probable second consensus diagnostic criteria. The neuromelanin visual pattern was compared to patients with Parkinson's disease with the same disease duration (n = 10) and healthy controls (n = 10). Substantia nigra semi-automated neuromelanin area/signal intensity was compared to the visual data. RESULTS: Groups were similar in age, sex, disease duration, and levodopa equivalent dose. Hoehn & Yahr stage was higher in parkinsonian multiple system atrophy patients, 69% of whom had normal neuromelanin size/signal, significantly different from Parkinson's disease patients, and similar to controls. Nigrosome 1 signal was lost in 74% of parkinsonian multiple system atrophy patients. Semi-automated neuromelanin substantia nigra signal, but not area, measurements were able to differentiate groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with parkinsonism, simple visual magnetic resonance imaging analysis showing normal neuromelanin substantia nigra and locus coeruleus, combined with nigrosome 1 loss, allowed the distinction of the parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy from Parkinson's disease and healthy controls.

Chest computed tomography (CT) images of patients who are infected with COVID-19 can offer early diagnosis and efficient forecast monitoring at a low cost. The diagnosis of COVID-19 on CT in an automated way can speed up many tasks and the application of medical treatments. This can help complement reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnosis. The aim of this work is to develop a system that automatically identifies ground-glass opacity (GGO) and pulmonary infiltrates (PIs) on CT images from patients with COVID-19. The purpose is to assess the disease progression during the patient's follow-up assessment and evaluation. We propose an efficient methodology that incorporates oversegmentation mean shift followed by superpixel-SLIC (simple linear iterative clustering) algorithm on CT images with COVID-19 for pulmonary parenchyma segmentation. To identify the pulmonary parenchyma, we described each superpixel cluster according to its position, grey intensity, second-order texture, and spatial-context-saliency features to classify by a tree random forest (TRF).

Chest computed tomography (CT) images of patients who are infected with COVID-19 can offer early diagnosis and efficient forecast monitoring at a low cost. The diagnosis of COVID-19 on CT in an automated way can speed up many tasks and the application of medical treatments. This can help complement reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnosis. The aim of this work is to develop a system that automatically identifies ground-glass opacity (GGO) and pulmonary infiltrates (PIs) on CT images from patients with COVID-19. The purpose is to assess the disease progression during the patient's follow-up assessment and evaluation. We propose an efficient methodology that incorporates oversegmentation mean shift followed by superpixel-SLIC (simple linear iterative clustering) algorithm on CT images with COVID-19 for pulmonary parenchyma segmentation. To identify the pulmonary parenchyma, we described each superpixel cluster according to its position, grey intensity, second-order texture, and spatial-context-saliency features to classify by a tree random forest (TRF). Second, by applying the watershed segmentation to the mean-shift clusters, only pulmonary parenchyma segmentation-identified zones showed GGO and PI based on the description of each watershed cluster of its position, grey intensity, gradient entropy, second-order texture, Euclidean position to the border region of the PI zone, and global saliency features, after using TRF.

Additionally, it seems probable that another outbreak caused by a coronavirus may occur in the future, given that this is the third outbreak caused by a coronavirus in recent history. In light of this, the medical community must develop reliable methods of curtailing long-term sequelae of coronaviruses, and the use of corlicosteroids in affected patients may be vital for this purpose.

The virus can also interact with ACE-2 receptors expressed in other tissues as in thyroid. This study predicted the complications involving the thyroid in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 11, 2020-May 31, 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Sixty-nine patients who were radiologically diagnosed as COVID-19 according to thoracic CT and had previously performed thoracic CT before November 2019 were included in the study according to the exclusion and inclusion criteria. Age and gender-matched controls (No. 69) were selected with normal thoracic CT whose PCR tests were also negative. Thyroid densities of participants were calculated and compared from the previous and current thoracic CTs. Results were also compared with the control group. RESULTS: Participants were composed of 69 patients (39 male, mean age 64.35 years). Thyroid densities were significantly decreased from 89HU to 76HU for whole gland, from 88HU to 76HU for right lobes and from 87.5HU to 75.5HU for left lobes at current thoracic CTs performed during COVID-19 (p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001 respectively). The decrease in densities of the whole thyroid gland, both left and right lobes, was correlated with mortality (p<0.001). The changes in thyroid densities were not correlated with age nor gender. The decreases in HU values of thyroid densities for whole gland, left and right lobes, were correlated with mortality (p<0.001, p<0.001, and p<0.001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is a multi-systemic disease that threatens vital organs, including the thyroid. Future studies are needed to investigate the association between SARS-CoV-2 and other complications.","Akkoyunlu, Y; Kalaycioglu, B; Yurtsever, I; Eren, A; Bayram, M; Mert, A; Akkoyunlu, M E",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,323,5

We assessed the utility of serum inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL-6), C reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), and SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and neutralizing antibodies (Diazyme, Poway, CA). In controls, non-hospitalized subjects, and hospitalized subjects assessed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (n = 278), median IgG levels in arbitrary units (AU)/mL were 0.05 in negative subjects, 14.83 in positive outpatients, and 30.61 in positive hospitalized patients (P<0.0001). Neutralizing antibody levels correlated significantly with IgG (r = 0.875; P<0.0001). Having combined values of IL-6 &#8805;10 pg/mL and CRP &#8805;10 mg/L occurred in 97.7% of inpatients versus 1.8% of outpatients (odds ratio 3,861, C statistic 0.976, P = 1.00 x 10-12). Antibody or ferritin levels did not add significantly to predicting hospitalization. Antibody testing in family members and contacts of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive cases (n = 759) was invaluable for case finding. Persistent IgM levels were associated with chronic COVID-19 symptoms. In 81,624 screened subjects, IgG levels were positive (&#8805;1.0 AU/mL) in 5.21%, while IgM levels were positive in 2.96% of subjects. In positive subjects median IgG levels in AU/mL were 3.14 if <30 years of age, 4.38 if 30-44 years of age, 7.89 if 45-54 years of age, 9.52 if 55-64 years of age, and 10.64 if &#8805;65 years of age (P = 2.96 x 10-38). Our data indicate that: 1) combined IL-6 &#8805;10 pg/mL and CRP &#8805;10 mg/L identify SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects requiring hospitalization; 2) IgG levels were significantly correlated with neutralizing antibody levels with a wide range of responses; 3) IgG levels have significant utility for case finding in exposed subjects; 4) persistently elevated IgM levels are associated with chronic symptoms; and 5) IgG levels are significantly higher in positive older subjects than their younger counterparts.","Schaefer, Ernst J; Dulipsingh, Latha; Comite, Florence; Jimison, Jessica; Grajower, Martin M; Lebowitz, Nathan E; Lang, Maxine; Geller, Andrew S; Diffenderfer, Margaret R; He, Lihong; Breton, Gary; Dansinger, Michael L; Saida, Ben; Yuan, Chong",PLoS One,323,15

Neuropilin 1 and 2 (NRP1 and NRP2) act as additional viral entry factors. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes COVID-19 disease. There is now strong evidence for neurological impacts of COVID-19, with pain as an important symptom, both in the acute phase of the disease and at later stages that are colloquially referred to as “long COVID.” In this narrative review, we discuss how COVID-19 may interact with the peripheral nervous system to cause pain in the early and late stages of the disease. We begin with a review of the state of the science on how viruses cause pain through direct and indirect interactions with nociceptors. We then cover what we currently know about how the unique cytokine profiles of moderate and severe COVID-19 may drive plasticity in nociceptors to promote pain and worsen existing pain states. Finally, we review evidence for direct infection of nociceptors by SARS-CoV-2 and the implications of this potential neurotropism. The state of the science points to multiple potential mechanisms through which COVID-19 could induce changes in nociceptor excitability that would be expected to promote pain, induce neuropathies, and worsen existing pain states.

Healthcare stereotype threat (HCST) is concern about being judged by providers and receiving biased medical treatment based on stereotypes about one's identity - in this case age. Given the attention to older adults' physical vulnerabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults may be especially worried about age-based judgments from medical providers and sensitive to ageist attitudes about COVID-19. Online data collection (April 13 to May 15, 2020) with adults aged 50 and older (N = 2325, M = 63.11, SD = 7.53) examined age-based HCST.

While remarkable progress has been achieved with various surface passivating agents, long-term stability of PSCs has not been fully addressed. Here, we report a new strategy for surface passivation of PSCs using a low cost industrial organic pigment quinacridone (QA). The procedure involves solution processing a soluble derivative of QA, N,N-bis(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-quinacridone (TBOC-QA), followed by facile thermal annealing to convert TBOC-QA to insoluble QA. With the halide perovskite thin films coated by QA, PSCs based on methylammonium lead Iodide (MAPbI3) showed significantly improved performance with remarkable stability. A PCE of 21.1% was achieved, which is much higher than 18.9% recorded for the unmodified devices. Density functional theory calculations revealed strong interactions between QA molecules and metal halides, which effectively reduced the surface defects of halide perovskite thin films and suppressed the nonradiative recombination. The QA coating with exceptional insolubility and hydrophobicity also led to remarkably enhanced contact angle from 35.6° for the pristine MAPbI3 thin films to 77.2° for QA coated MAPbI3 thin films. As a result, the stabilities of QA passivated MAPbI3 perovskite thin films and PSCs were greatly enhanced, retaining about 90 % of the initial efficiencies after more than 1000 hours storage under ambient conditions. The universality of this passivation strategy was evaluated by extending MAPbI3 systems to triple-cation mixed-halide perovskite systems, which further confirm the effectiveness of industrial pigment passivation of PSCs with enhanced efficiency and stability.","He, Qingquan; Worku, Michael; Liu, He; Lochner, Eric; Robb, Alex J; Lteif, Sandrine; Winfred, J S Raaj Vellore; Hanson, Kenneth; Schlenoff, Joseph B; Kim, Bumjoon J; Ma, Biwu",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,323,22

This number is increasing further due to COVID-19 and the associated automation of education and testing. Despite such wide usage, the AI-based testing literature of these""intelligent""models is highly lacking. Most of the papers proposing new models rely only on quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) based agreement with human raters for showing model efficacy. However, this effectively ignores the highly multi-feature nature of essay scoring. Essay scoring depends on features like coherence, grammar, relevance, sufficiency and, vocabulary. To date, there has been no study testing Automated Essay Scoring: AES systems holistically on all these features. With this motivation, we propose a model agnostic adversarial evaluation scheme and associated metrics for AES systems to test their natural language understanding capabilities and overall robustness. We evaluate the current state-of-the-art AES models using the proposed scheme and report the results on five recent models. These models range from feature-engineering-based approaches to the latest deep learning algorithms. We find that AES models are highly overstable. Even heavy modifications(as much as 25%) with content unrelated to the topic of the questions do not decrease the score produced by the models. On the other hand, irrelevant content, on average, increases the scores, thus showing that the model evaluation strategy and rubrics should be reconsidered. We also ask 200 human raters to score both an original and adversarial response to seeing if humans can detect differences between the two and whether they agree with the scores assigned by auto scores.","Kabra, Anubha; Bhatia, Mehar; Kumar, Yaman; Li, Jessy Junyi; Jin, Di; Shah, Rajiv Ratn",,323,20

Nasal rinses and mouthwashes, which directly impact the major sites of reception and transmission of human coronaviruses (HCoV), may provide an additional level of protection against the virus. Common over-the-counter nasal rinses and mouthwashes/gargles were tested for their ability to inactivate high concentrations of HCoV using contact times of 30 s, 1 min, and 2 min. Reductions in titers were measured by using the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50 ) assay. A 1% baby shampoo nasal rinse solution inactivated HCoV greater than 99.9% with a 2-min contact time.

Many scientists are working tirelessly to find a treatment and a possible vaccine. Furthermore, governments, scientific institutions and companies are acting quickly to make resources available, including funds and the opening of large-volume data repositories, to accelerate innovation and discovery aimed at solving this pandemic. In this paper, we develop a novel automated theme-based visualisation method, combining advanced data modelling of large corpora, information mapping and trend analysis, to provide a top-down and bottom-up browsing and search interface for quick discovery of topics and research resources. We apply this method on two recently released publications datasets (Dimensions' COVID-19 dataset and the Allen Institute for AI's CORD-19). The results reveal intriguing information including increased efforts in topics such as social distancing; cross-domain initiatives (e.g. mental health and education); evolving research in medical topics; and the unfolding trajectory of the virus in different territories through publications. The results also demonstrate the need to quickly and automatically enable search and browsing of large corpora.

Despite their different physiological functions, disease-related proteins like tau, alpha-synuclein, Tar DNA binding protein-43, Fused in sarcoma and mutant Huntingtin, all share low complexity regions that can mediate their liquid-liquid phase transitions. The proteins' phase transitions can range from native monomers to soluble oligomers, liquid droplets and further to irreversible, often-mislocalised aggregates that characterise the stages and severity of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent advances into the underlying pathogenic mechanisms have associated mislocalisation and aberrant accumulation of disease-related proteins with defective nucleocytoplasmic transport and its mediators called karyopherins. These studies identify karyopherin abnormalities in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, that range from altered expression levels to the subcellular mislocalisation and aggregation of karyopherin alpha and beta proteins. The reported findings reveal that in addition to their classical function in nuclear import and export, karyopherins can also act as chaperones by shielding aggregation-prone proteins against misfolding, accumulation and irreversible phase-transition into insoluble aggregates. Karyopherin abnormalities can, therefore, be both the cause and consequence of protein mislocalisation and aggregate formation in degenerative proteinopathies. The resulting vicious feedback cycle of karyopherin pathology and proteinopathy identifies karyopherin abnormalities as a common denominator of onset and progression of neurodegenerative disease. Pharmacological targeting of karyopherins, already in clinical trials as therapeutic intervention targeting cancers such as glioblastoma and viral infections like COVID-19, may therefore represent a promising new avenue for disease-modifying treatments in neurodegenerative proteinopathies.","Pasha, Terouz; Zatorska, Anna; Sharipov, Daulet; Rogelj, Boris; Hortobágyi, Tibor; Hirth, Frank",Brain,323,24

A significant number of elderly patients require hospitalization and develop serious and sometimes life-threatening complications. The aim of this study is to evaluate the preliminary impact (8 weeks) of CoVID-19, focusing on proximal femur fractures, analyzing data and results compared to the same period of 2019. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 22nd to April 18th, 2020 we surgically treated 121 proximal femur fractures (61 in Piacenza; 60 in Parma, 16 male, 44 female, mean age 81.1). In the same period of 2019, we treated 169 proximal femur fractures (90 in Piacenza, 33 male, 57 female, mean age 81.9; 79 in Parma, 29 males, 50 female, mean age 80.2). We had 21/61 (34.4%) patients resulted positive for COVID-19 and 11/61 in Parma (18.3%), based on nasal-pharyngeal swab, chest CT scan and/or lung US findings. RESULTS: The incidence of proximal femur fractures had a significant reduction during CoVID-19 spread in Piacenza and Parma. Authors have noticed an elevated number of deaths within 21 days after surgery. Piacenza: 4 cases in 2019 (4.4%) and 11 in 2020 (18.0%), of which 9 cases CoVID positive. In Parma in 2019 two deaths were encountered; in 2020 6 patients died and 5 cases were CoVID positive. CONCLUSION: In the first two months of the Italian epidemic, in the cities of Piacenza and Parma over 80% of deaths have occurred in patients over 70 years old. Even if preliminary, our study shows a significant increase in death in elderly patients surgically treated for proximal femur fractures, particularly in the Piacenza Hospital.","Maniscalco, Pietro; Poggiali, Erika; Quattrini, Fabrizio; Ciatti, Corrado; Magnacavallo, Andrea; Vercelli, Andrea; Domenichini, Marco; Vaienti, Enrico; Pogliacomi, Francesco; Ceccarelli, Francesco",Acta Biomed,323,16

The performance of a respiratory mask depends on the efficiency of the filter layer which is mostly made of polypropylene melt blown non-woven (PP-MB-NW). So far, very limited characterization data are available for the PPE-MB-NW in terms to achieve desired particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) against 0.3 µm size, which are imperative in order to facilitate the right selection of PP-MB-NW fabric for the development of mask. In present study, eight different kinds of PP-MB-NW fabrics (Sample A-H) of varied structural morphology are chosen. The different PP-MB-NW were characterized for its pore size and distribution by mercury porosimeter and BET surface area analyzer was explored first time to understand the importance of blind pore in PFE. The PP-MB-NW samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy so as to know the surface morphology. The filtration efficiency, pressure drop and breathing resistance of various PP-MB-NW fabric samples are investigated in single and double layers combination against the particle size of 0.3, 0.5 and 1 µm. The samples which are having low pore dia, high solid fraction volume, and low air permeability has high filtration efficiency (> 90%) against 0.3 µm particle with high pressure drop (16.3-21.3 mm WC) and breathing resistance (1.42-1.92 mbar) when compared to rest of the samples. This study will pave the way for the judicial selection of right kind of filter layer i.e., PP-MB-NW fabric for the development of mask and it will be greatly helpful in manufacturing of mask in this present pandemic with desired PFE indicating considerable promise for defense against respiratory pandemic.","Pandey, Lokesh K; Singh, Virendra V; Sharma, Pushpendra K; Meher, Damayanti; Biswas, Utpal; Sathe, Manisha; Ganesan, Kumaran; Thakare, Vikas B; Agarwal, Kavita",Sci Rep,323,16
459228,459228,459228,Heart failure outcomes and Covid-19,20.646389,8.948798,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid adjustment of obstetrical delivery models including fewer antenatal appointments and increased use of telehealth. We hypothesized that an increase in telemedicine and a decrease in antepartum visits owing to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a decreased proportion of people with a postpartum contraception plan at the time of the birth-hospitalization admission and a reduced uptake of top-tier forms of contraception at birth-hospitalization admission and discharge, and the routine postpartum visit, which has otherwise been increasing in recent years.1,2 STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study comparing a randomly selected sample of people giving birth at a large, tertiary referral center during a regional ""shelter in place"" order, March 16, 2020, to July 31, 2020, with a previously abstracted random sample of people delivering between November 1, 2017, and April 30, 2018, was conducted. This study was reviewed and approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board before its initiation. The study was powered to detect a 10% difference in the proportion of those arriving at birth-hospitalization with a contraceptive plan (power 80%, alpha 0.05). The final sample size included 586 people (318 in the pre-COVID cohort and 268 in the COVID cohort). Multivariable modified Poisson regression model was used to estimate the relative risk of arriving at birth-hospitalization with a contraceptive plan in pre-COVID vs COVID cohorts, adjusting for age, parity, insurance status, and delivery mode. Secondary outcomes included tier of contraception plan at admission, discharge, and 6 weeks postpartum (classified by World Health Organization Tiered-Effectiveness3), attendance at postpartum visit, and whether the postpartum visit was conducted via telehealth. Tiered effectiveness was used for this study's purposes because it was hypothesized that telehealth would mostly affect the provision of top-tier forms of contraception that require in-person initiation. Fisher exact test was used to compare the secondary outcomes. RESULTS: For the 2 cohorts, the median age was 32 years (range, 17-48 years) and median parity was 1 (range, 0-6). The majority (78%) had private insurance and most commonly identified as non-Hispanic White (38%) and Asian (36%). Baseline demographics did not differ between the cohorts. At birth-hospitalization admission, a smaller proportion of people had a postpartum contraceptive plan in the COVID cohort than in the pre-COVID cohort (73.9% vs 99.4%, adjusted risk ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-0.91, P<.001). A smaller proportion of people had a plan for top-tier contraception among the COVID cohort compared with the pre-COVID cohort at both admission and discharge (46.0% vs 71.0%, P<.01 and 31.0% vs 37.9%, P=.05) (Figure). More than 80% of the people attended a routine postpartum visit in both cohorts (P=.30) with 17.7% being telehealth visits in the COVID cohort compared with telehealth not being offered pre-COVID. Among those who attended their postpartum visit, the proportion discharged with a plan for interval top-tier contraception that was fulfilled was high in both groups (76.3% pre-COVID vs 71.2% post-COVID, P=.56). CONCLUSION: The study found a significant decrease in people arriving at birth-hospitalization with a contraception plan in the months following a COVID-19 ""shelter in place"" order when compared with the pre-COVID cohort. It is suspected that changes in the obstetrical service models indirectly deprioritized the most effective forms of postpartum contraception because sterilization requires a signed consent before birth-hospitalization and postplacental intrauterine devices require consent before delivery.4,5 Current state legislation requiring in-person signature to consent for federally funded sterilization remains a barrier. We found that fewer individuals left with top-tier contraception than with plan on admission, especially within the COVID cohort. In addition to clinical contraindications that arise during labor, which preclude placement of an intrauterine device in the postpartum setting, many patients requested an expedited discharge during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the prenatal care model continues, this transition to adopt virtual visits, reduce visit schedules, and expedite postpartum discharge, actualizing patients' contraceptive plans is increasingly more dependent on early inpatient provision. Maternity care providers should consider initiating postpartum contraception counseling and completing mandatory consents earlier in the antenatal period. This study is inherently limited by its retrospective nature of review and additional qualitative studies may better characterize this trend in contraceptive uptake. In the meantime, obstetrical care providers should carefully evaluate institutional barriers to postpartum contraception during this movement to telehealth.","Miller, Hayley E; Henkel, Andrea; Leonard, Stephanie A; Miller, Sarah E; Tran, Linh; Bianco, Katherine; Shaw, Kate A",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,323,16

This study sought to investigate the relationship between findings on echocardiography, mortality and race in COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study including 164 adults (61±13years; 78% male; 36% BAME) hospitalized with COVID-19 undergoing echocardiography between March 16 and May 9, 2020 at 3 days (IQR 2 - 5) from admission. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Results: After a median follow up of 31 days (IQR 14 - 42 days), 58 (35%) patients had died. The right ventricle (RV) was dilated in 62 (38%) patients, and 58 (35%) patients had RV systolic dysfunction. Only 2 (1%) patients had left ventricular (LV) dilatation and 133 (81%) had normal or hyperdynamic LV systolic function. Reduced tricuspid annulus planar systolic excursion was associated with elevated D-dimer (&#961; = -0.18, p = 0.025) and high-sensitivity cardiac Troponin (&#961; = -0.30, p < 0.0001). Reduced RV systolic function (HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.05 - 3.09; p = 0.032) was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality after adjustment for demographic and clinical risk factors. Comparing white and BAME individuals, there were no differences in echocardiography findings, biomarkers or mortality. Conclusions: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia, reduced RV systolic function is prevalent and associated with all-cause mortality. There is however, no racial variation in the early findings on echocardiography, biomarkers or mortality.","Moody, William E; Mahmoud-Elsayed, Hani M; Senior, Jonathan; Gul, Uzma; Khan-Kheil, Ayisha M; Horne, Sebastian; Banerjee, Amitava; Bradlow, William M; Huggett, Robert; Hothi, Sandeep S; Shahid, Muhammad; Steeds, Richard P",,323,1

We tested the hypothesis that infusion of BNP after an acute myocardial infarction would reduce left ventricular systolic and diastolic volumes and improve left ventricular ejection fraction compared with placebo. METHODS: A total of 58 patients who underwent successful revascularisation for an acute ST elevation anterior myocardial infarction were randomised to receive 72-hour infusion of BNP at 0.006 µg/kg/min or placebo. Left ventricular end diastolic and systolic volumes and left ventricular ejection fraction were measured at baseline and at 30 days by multigated acquisition scan. Left ventricular infarction size was measured by cardiac MRI. RESULTS: BNP infusion led to significantly higher BNP levels and plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate at 72 hours. No significant difference in change of left ventricular volumes or ejection fraction from baseline to 30 days was observed between groups. Although left ventricular infarction size measured by cardiac MRI was not significantly different between BNP infusion versus placebo (p=0.39), there was a trend towards reduced infarction size in patients with a baseline ejection fraction of <40% (p=0.14). CONCLUSIONS: Infusion of BNP in patients with an anterior myocardial infarction did not affect parameters of left ventricular remodelling. Patients treated with BNP who had a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction of <40% had a trend towards reduced left ventricular infarction size compared with placebo. These results do not support the use of intravenous BNP in patients after recent myocardial infarction.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in social relationships in a U.S. population sample during a time of social distancing. METHODS: We deployed a matched, longitudinal survey design of the National Institutes of Health Adult Social Relationship Scales to assess the social aspects of emotional support, instrumental support, friendship, loneliness, perceived hostility, and perceived rejection from a time without social distancing (February 2018) to a time where social distancing directives were active (May 2020). Changes in social relationships were compared using paired t-tests, and generalized linear regression models were constructed to identify subpopulations experiencing differential changes in each subdomain of social relationships during social distancing. RESULTS: Within our sample population, individuals experienced an increased sense of emotional support, instrumental support, and loneliness, and decreased feelings of friendship and perceived hostility during a period of social distancing. Individuals with low self-rated health experienced a decreased sense of emotional support, and females experienced increased feelings of loneliness compared with males. CONCLUSIONS: Social distancing measurably impacts social relationships and may have a disproportionate impact on females and individuals with lower self-rated health. If novel emergent infectious diseases become more commonplace, social interventions may be needed to mitigate the potential adverse impact of social distancing on social relationships.","Philpot, Lindsey M; Ramar, Priya; Roellinger, Daniel L; Barry, Barbara A; Sharma, Pravesh; Ebbert, Jon O",Soc Sci Med,323,1

Although non-significant, the mean duration of ICU stay was relatively shorter in patients who received therapeutic doses of anticoagulation (p=0.32). Duration of treatment with methylprednisolone was significantly associated with patient outcomes (p=0.04) and serum ferritin levels had a tendency to negatively affect outcome (p=0.06). Clearly there are still no specific targeted medications for COVID-19 treatment, except for empirically symptoms-guided treatments and management of mild to critically ill patients. Early use of systemic corticosteroids for severe to critically ill patients in the ICU using S/F ratio and CRP levels may improve outcomes.","Afriyie-Mensah, Jane; Aboagye, Elvis Twumasi; Ganu, Vincent Jessey; Bondzi, Samuel; Tetteh, Dennis; Kwarteng, Ernest; Akamah, Joseph; Doku, Alfred; Adjei, Patrick",Pan Afr Med J,323,33

The government of Montenegro established the National Coordination Body for Communicable Diseases (NKT). Even though the NKT is set as a multisectoral and multidisciplinary body to coordinate the implementation of the broader health and socio-economic measures, no representative from the Montenegro’s sport system has taken part in decision-making processes.

They are the 4th industrial revolution with its accelerated technological advancement;global warming and the concomitant climatic changes that are collectively causing human and agricultural displacement with catastrophic side effects;global unrest which is resulting in the displacement and disruption of large numbers of people and the corona virus pandemic with its emerging effects upon so many aspects of human existence. This is an opinion piece in which the author proposes a potential scenario that will change the face of human occupation and contribute towards considerable threat to the health and wellness of humanity. A scenario in which many occupations will be replaced by advanced technology and/or activities of daily living transformed by climate change. This, together with human displacement, will result in millions of people being jobless and the profile of human occupation changing. The impact of the corona virus remains an emerging phenomenon that is and will continue to have far reaching effects upon human behaviour, occupation, health and the global economy. A further consequence of all these phenomena will provide the world with spiritual, ethical and moral dilemmas that threaten to challenge the training and capabilities of health professionals. As health professionals with a profound understanding of the physical, mental and spiritual importance of human occupation upon the health of humanity, occupational therapists will need to decide whether or not they are going to react creatively and proactively to these challenges or remain within the boxes of their past. Guided by the collaborative ethos and enablement skills of the Participatory Occupational Justice Framework (POJF), and current proactive movements within the WFOT and occupational science, the author suggests a tentative approach the occupational therapy profession can adopt in order to contribute to the continuing wellness of humanity and how it may need to transform in order to prepare itself to accost and overcome these challenges.","Joubert, R.",South African Journal of Occupational Therapy,323,1

Recent research has also associated MDSCs with numerous obstetrical and gynecological diseases. During pregnancy, MDSCs accumulate to ensure maternal-fetal immune tolerance, whereas they are decreased in patients who suffer from early miscarriage or preeclampsia. While the etiology of endometriosis is still unknown, abnormal accumulation of MDSCs in the peripheral blood and peritoneal fluid, alongside an increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been observed in these patients, which is central to the cellular immune regulations by MDSCs. Additionally, the regulation of MDSCs observed in tumors is also applicable to gynecologic neoplasms, including ovarian cancer and cervical cancer. More recently, emerging evidence has shown that there are high levels of MDSCs in premature ovarian failure (POF) and in vitro fertilization (IVF), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In this review, the generation and mechanisms of MDSCs are summarized. In particular the modulation of these cells in immune-related obstetrical and gynecological diseases is discussed, including potential treatment options targeting MDSCs.","Zheng, Zi-Meng; Yang, Hui-Li; Lai, Zhen-Zhen; Wang, Cheng-Jie; Yang, Shao-Liang; Li, Ming-Qing; Shao, Jun",Am J Reprod Immunol,323,24

We adopted a socio-cultural approach to citizenship drawing on the scholarly tradition of ideological dilemmas and rhetorical psychology as well as interdisciplinary work on neoliberalism. In our analysis of over one hundred briefings and other material by the Prime Minister and members of the Cabinet, we identified five interrelated constructions of the 'good citizen': the confined, the heroic, the sacrificial, the unfree and the responsible citizen. The paper maps these constructions onto the ideological dilemmas of freedom/control, passive/active citizenship and individualism/collectivism. We show that, through the rhetorical use of notions of gratefulness for citizens' sacrifice and shared responsibility, the UK government's discourse appears to challenge the dominant model of the neoliberal citizen. However, it solidifies this very same model by responsibilizing individual citizens whilst abdicating itself from responsibility.

Drawing on qualitative research, this article focuses on the impact of COVID-19 on routine vaccination programs in Pakistan.

To help clarify this we conducted individual participant data meta-analysis and aggregate data meta-analysis on summary estimates to evaluate cross-sectional associations between retinal vascular caliber and CKD. A systematic review was performed using Medline and EMBASE for articles published until October 2018. The aggregate analysis used a two-stage approach combining summary estimates from eleven studies (44,803 patients) while the individual participant analysis used a one-stage approach combining raw data from nine studies (33,222 patients). CKD stages 3-5 was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate under 60 mL/min/1.73m2. Retinal arteriolar and venular caliber (central retinal arteriolar and venular equivalent) were assessed from retinal photographs using computer-assisted methods. Logistic regression estimated relative risk of CKD stages 3-5 associated with a 20 µm decrease (approximately one standard deviation) in central retinal arteriolar and venular equivalent. Prevalence of CKD stages 3-5 was 11.2 % of 33,222 and 11.3 % of 44,803 patients in the individual participant and aggregate data analysis, respectively. No significant associations were detected in adjusted analyses between central retinal arteriolar and venular equivalent and CKD stages 3-5 in the aggregate analysis for central retinal arteriolar relative risk (0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.94-1.03); venular equivalent (0.99, 0.95- 1.04) or individual participant central retinal arteriolar (0.99, 0.95-1.04) or venular equivalent (1.01, 0.97-1.05). Thus, meta-analysis provided little evidence to suggest that cross sectional direct measurements of retinal vascular caliber was associated with CKD stages 3-5 in the general population.

This study compared the anxiety level of the frontline dental staff (FDS) to the general public in Yichang during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and examined potential explanatory factors to the differences. METHODS: Two online questionnaires were used separately to collect data from FDS and the general public. The Chinese version of Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was included for the assessment of anxiety. Firstly, a Chi-square test was conducted to compare the anxiety state between these two groups. Then, a bivariate analysis using Cramer's V and Eta squared was conducted to find the potential factors. Lastly, a binary logistic regression was performed to examine the association between potential factors and the anxiety state of FDS. RESULTS: In general, FDS were 4.342 (95% CI: 2.427-7.768) times more likely to suffer from anxiety disorders than the general public. The bivariate analysis showed that age, Level Three Protective Measures (PM-3), conflicts with patients and/or colleagues were moderately associated with the anxiety state of FDS. But the knowledge of COVID-19, the treatment to suspected or confirmed cases both had a weak association with the anxiety among FDS. Conversely, workload, the exposure to potential infectious substance and conducting aerosol generated performance were not significantly related to the anxiety of FDS. As the model indicated, an elder age and PM-3 protective measures could lower the anxiety state of FDS, whereas the conflict with patients or/and colleagues would worsen it. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, FDS were more likely to suffer from anxiety disorders than the general public. An elder age, sufficient personal protective measures and good relationships with colleagues and patients would help them to maintain good mental health.","Zhao, Suli; Cao, Jing; Sun, Rongcan; Zhang, Lin; Liu, Beibei",BMC Oral Health,323,24

AIM: The objective of this article was to find the prevalence rates of depression, anxiety and stress and their socio-demographic correlates among Indian population during the lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using an electronic questionnaire. A total of 354 participants were recruited through convenience sampling. Depression, anxiety and stress were measured using Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), a 21-item self-reported questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 25%, 28% and 11.6% of the participants were moderate to extremely severely depressed, anxious and stressed, respectively. Binary logistic regressions indicated employment status (odds ratio (OR) = 1.91; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.072-3.418) and binge drinking (OR = 2.03; 95% CI: 1.045-3.945) were significantly associated with depressive symptoms; gender (OR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.317-3.589), employment status (OR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.002-3.141) and binge drinking (OR = 2.62; 95% CI: 1.361-5.048) were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms; and binge drinking (OR = 3.42; 95% CI: 1.544-7.583) was significantly associated with stress symptoms. CONCLUSION: Depression, anxiety and stress among Indian population during the lockdown were prevalent.

The aim of this pilot study was to determine IAQ in elementary schools different in their internal and external characteristics, in settings of COVID-19 epidemics. Methods: IAQ parameters: fine particulate matter (PM2,5) mass concentration, CO2 concentration, temperature and relative humidity were measured in parallel in four elementary schools/classrooms during October (non-heating season) and four months (including holiday in January) of heating season. IAQ parameters were measured in settings of anti-epidemic restrictions (≤13 students in classroom, frequent ventilation). Results: During October, except in one school, PM2,5 concentrations were below the upper recommended value (25μg/m ), but started rising in all schools in the heating season. The highest concentrations of PM2,5 were registered in two schools with closed or shortly opened windows. CO2 concentrations were mostly in the recommended range (up to 1000ppm) except in the school with constantly closed windows and in three schools in February when concentrations were higher. Except in one, the same school, and in January, both temperature and relative humidity were out of the recommended range (24,0 27,0°C in non-heating;20,0 24,0°C in heating season;and 45 55%), with temperature mainly above and relative humidity mainly below it in three schools. The largest deviation in temperature and relative humidity were registered in urban schools. Registered differences may be explained by different internal and external characteristics. Original paper Conclusion: Despite anti-epidemic restrictions, most of the measured IAQ parameters were out of the recommended values in heating season. In addition, further deterioration of IAQ could be expected if all students had been presented in the classroom. Finally, to assure a healthy school environment in heating season, further optimisation of both indoor and outdoor conditions is needed in both pandemic and non-pandemic settings.","Kulo, A.; Klarić, S.; Cetković, A.; Blekić, A.; Kusturica, J.; Spahić, N.; Šljivo, A.; Šecić, D.",Psychiatria Danubina,323,24

Since its discovery in 1982, the roles of Wnt signaling have been established in various key regulatory systems in biology. Wnt signals exert pleiotropic effects, including mitogenic stimulation, cell fate specification, and differentiation. The Wnt signaling pathway in humans has been shown to be involved in a wide variety of disorders including colon cancer, sarcoma, coronary artery disease, tetra-amelia, Mullerian duct regression, eye vascular defects, and abnormal bone mass. The canonical Wnt pathway functions by regulating the function of the transcriptional coactivator ß-catenin, whereas noncanonical pathways function independent of ß-catenin. Although the role of Wnt signaling is well established in epithelial malignancies, its role in mesenchymal tumors is more controversial. Some studies have suggested that Wnt signaling plays a pro-oncogenic role in various sarcomas by driving cell proliferation and motility; however, others have reported that Wnt signaling acts as a tumor suppressor by committing tumor cells to differentiate into a mature lineage. Wnt signaling pathway also plays an important role in regulating cancer stem cell function. In this review, we will discuss Wnt signaling pathway and its role in osteosarcoma.","Singla, Amit; Wang, Jichuan; Yang, Rui; Geller, David S; Loeb, David M; Hoang, Bang H",Adv Exp Med Biol,323,1

During this global health crisis, it is fundamentally crucial to find strategies to combat SARS-CoV-2. Despite several efforts in this direction and continuing clinical trials, no vaccine has been approved for it yet. METHODS: To find a preventive measure, we have computationally designed a multi-epitopic subunit vaccine using immuno-informatic approaches. RESULTS: The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 involved in its survival and pathogenicity were used to predict antigenic epitopes. The antigenic epitopes were capable of eliciting a strong humoral as well as cell-mediated immune response, our predictions suggest. The final vaccine was constructed by joining the all epitopes with specific linkers and to enhance their stability and immunogenicity. The physicochemical property of the vaccine was assessed. The vaccine 3D structure prediction and validation were done and docked with the human TLR-3 receptor. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations of the vaccine-TLR-3 receptor complex are employed to assess its dynamic motions and binding stability in-silico. CONCLUSION: Based on this study, we strongly suggest synthesizing this vaccine, which further can be tested in-vitro and in-vivo to check its potency in a cure for COVID-19.","Kumar, Amit; Kumar, Prateek; Saumya, Kumar Udit; Kapuganti, Shivani K; Bhardwaj, Taniya; Giri, Rajanish",Expert Rev Vaccines,323,4

These tests require that each underlying variable in the model be transformed into partial sums of the positive and negative components. The positive components represent the rising markets and the negative components embody the falling markets. The sample period covers some part of the COVID19 pandemic. Since the data is non normal and the volatility is time varying, the bootstrap simulations with leverage adjustments are used in order to create reliable critical values when causality tests are conducted. The results of the asymmetric causality tests disclose that the bear markets are causing the recessions as well as the bull markets are causing the economic expansions. The causal effect of bull markets on economic expansions is higher compared to the causal effect of bear markets on economic recessions. In addition, it is found that economic expansions cause bull markets but recessions do not cause bear markets. Thus, the policies that remedy the falling financial markets can also help the economy when it is in a recession.","Hatemi-J, Abdulnasser",,323,4

This study describes the characteristics of COVID-19 infections in Vietnam and policy responses to identify potential factors contributing to the relative success of Vietnam in containing this pandemic. METHODS: Narrative analyses were applied to describe the pandemic and policy responses. Descriptive statistics, generalized linear regression and a susceptible-infected-recovered model, were used to explore the effectiveness of Vietnamese policy responses to COVD-19. RESULTS: To date, Vietnam is one of the few countries that have successfully control the spread of COVID-19. At the 26 October 2020, Vietnam has 1169 infected cases of COVID-19, of which 1061 people recovered, and 35 people died from the disease. COVID-19 infected patients in Vietnam were relatively younger than those in other countries with an average age of 36. Most of the infected cases were from international travels. Policy responses from Vietnam were implemented early and strictly. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the proximity to China, where COVID-19 emerged, Vietnam has experienced a small number of COVID-19 infections and fatalities, compared with other countries. Most infected patients were relatively young and exposure was attributed to international travel.

However, the prognostic meaning and time-line changes of lung injury assessed by LUS in COVID-19 hospitalised patients, is unknown. METHODS: Prospective cohort study designed to analyse prognostic value of LUS in COVID-19 patients by using a quantitative scale (LUZ-score) during the first 72â h after admission. Primary endpoint was in-hospital death and/or admission to the intensive care unit. Total length of hospital stay, increase of oxygen flow or escalate medical treatment during the first 72â h, were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: 130 patients were included in the final analysis; mean age was 56.7±13.5â years. Time since the beginning of symptoms until admission was 6â days (4-9). Lung injury assessed by LUZ-score did not differ during the first 72â h (21 points [16-26] at admission versus 20 points [16-27] at 72â h; p=0.183). In univariable logistic regression analysis estimated PaO2/FiO2 (HR 0.99 [0.98-0.99]; p=0.027) and LUZ-score>22 points (5.45 (1.42-20.90); p=0.013) were predictors for the primary endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: LUZ-score is an easy, simple and fast point of care ultrasound tool to identify patients with severe lung injury due to COVID-19, upon admission. Baseline score is predictive of severity along the whole period of hospitalisation. The score facilitates early implementation or intensification of treatment for COVID-19 infection.

For over two months of stay-at-home orders, houses became the only place where people slept, ate, worked, practiced sports, and socialized. As consolidated evidence exists on housing as a determinant of health, it is of great interest to explore the impact that COVID-19 response-related lockdown measures have had on mental health and well-being. We conducted a large web-based survey on 8177 students from a university institute in Milan, Northern Italy, one of the regions most heavily hit by the pandemic in Europe. As emerged from our analysis, poor housing is associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms during lockdown. In particular, living in apartments <60 m2 with poor views and scarce indoor quality is associated with, respectively, 1.31 (95% CI: 1046-1637), 1.368 (95% CI: 1166-1605), and 2.253 (95% CI: 1918-2647) times the risk of moderate-severe and severe depressive symptoms. Subjects reporting worsened working performance from home were over four times more likely to also report depression (OR = 4.28, 95% CI: 3713-4924). Housing design strategies should focus on larger and more livable living spaces facing green areas.

Roughly half of the study participants did not routinely screen their patients/clients for IPV, with no differences for the professional groupings. Utilization of referral resources was significantly lower for medical care providers, 78.5% of whom did not use any. Perceived barriers to screening and referral were examined as practitioner-based and organization-based, and we identified tangible provisions (protocols and practice materials) as a relevant variable. As we conjectured, organization-based barriers were more strongly associated with lower rates of screening and referral than were practitioner-based barriers, regardless of professional grouping. Moreover, tangible provisions, controlling for perceived barriers, significantly added to routine screening and frequency of referral resources usage, particularly for medical care providers. Results are discussed in the context of a systems-level approach to improving IPV services in health care with organizational practice enhancements.","Kosiak, Klaudia; Contreras, Isaias M; Stoever, Jane; Toohey, Julianne; Novaco, Raymond W",J Interpers Violence,323,3

The dental literature shows that many dental procedures produce aerosols and droplets that are contaminated with bacteria and blood. These aerosols represent a potential route for disease transmission. The literature also documents that airborne contamination can be minimized easily and inexpensively by layering several infection control steps into the routine precautions used during all dental procedures.

This can result in strangulation with high mortality. This condition is most often observed after abdominal surgery. The exact underlying pathology in patients without prior abdominal surgery is still largely unclear, and only scarce literature on the role of COVID-19 or long-term prone position is available. CASE PRESENTATION: A 74-year-old male patient without prior abdominal surgery was presented to the emergency department with pulmonary and gastro-intestinal symptoms of COVID-19. The patient was known to have diverticulosis of colon and sigmoid. After a complicated ICU course, the patient developed a jejunal closed loop obstruction, and a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed. Fixation of the omentum to the retroperitoneum was released, without observation of further adhesions, bowel torsion or ischemic bowel. Further abdominal course was uncomplicated, however, unfortunately the patient died following pulmonary deterioration. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The differential diagnosis of small bowel obstruction is extensive; however, adhesions are most often observed. In patients without prior surgery, also adhesions are observed, mainly caused by earlier infections. There might be a role for abdominal COVID-19 infection and prolonged prone position in the emergence of adhesions; however, literature is lacking. Alternatively, asymptomatic diverticulitis might have led to adhesion formation. CONCLUSION: Closed loop obstructions in patients without prior abdominal surgery are uncommon and post-infectious abdominal status might cause adhesions. It is unclear whether abdominal manifestations of COVID-19 and prolonged prone position can also cause adhesions and, thereby, small bowel obstructions.","Meekel, J.P.; Timmerman, M.C.; Hoeksema, M.; Boer, F.C. den",Ann Med Surg (Lond),323,1

Results: According to symptoms and laboratory and radiologic findings, COVID-19 cases were defined as symptomatic with pneumonia, symptomatic without pneumonia, asymptomatic with pneumonia, or asymptomatic without pneumonia. There were differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis among the four groups. Both non-invasive mechanical ventilation (18, 4.2%) and invasive mechanical ventilation (11, 2.6%) were applied in only the symptomatic with pneumonia group. Likewise, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and continuous renal replacement therapy were applied in only the symptomatic with pneumonia group. There were no differences in viral load, the durations of viral shedding, and hospitalization among the four groups. Conclusion: We have defined a comprehensive spectrum of COVID-19 with and without pneumonia. The symptomatic with pneumonia group consumed more medical resources than the other groups, and extra caution and monitoring should be applied in this group. The asymptomatic COVID-19 group had a similar viral load and viral shedding duration as the symptomatic COVID-19 group.","Zeng, Huihui; Ma, Yiming; Zhou, Zhiguo; Liu, Wenlong; Huang, Peng; Jiang, Mingyan; Liu, Qimi; Chen, Ping; Luo, Hong; Chen, Yan",Front Med (Lausanne),323,5

Since December 2019, it has been found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spread to the whole country. Some parts of the world also showed an outbreak trend [1–3]. Real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction,RT-PCR) and viral gene sequencing are the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. At present, upper respiratory tract nasopharyngeal swabs are mostly used as nucleic acid detection samples in China, but the positive rate is low. However, there are few reports on clinical application of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in other biological samples. Methods | The East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University is a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. This observation study included 132 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the infectious disease areas of the East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from 2020.1.31 to 2020.2.29. COVID-19 diagnostic criteria: according to China's 《pneumonia diagnosis and treatment Program of novel coronavirus infection (trial version 7) 》, in accordance with the relevant epidemiological and clinical manifestations, nasopharyngeal swabs real-time fluorescence RT-PCR detection of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive, COVID-19 cases were divided into mild, ordinary, severe and severe [4]. The nasopharyngeal swabs of 132 cases of COVID-19 were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid on admission, including 72 males and 60 females, with an average age of 66.7 ± 9.1 years, including 80 cases of common type, 44 cases of severe type and 8 cases of critical type. During the period of admission, under the condition of tertiary protection, nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, blood, feces and anal swabs of COVID-19 cases were collected many times in the isolation ward for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection. All biological samples are sealed and transferred to the laboratory in strict accordance with the standard process. The RT-PCR test kits (BioGerm) were recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The same technician and brand of test kit was used for all RT-PCR testing reported; both internal controls and negative controls were routinely performed with each batch of tests. Results | 132 the results of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of various biological samples during the treatment of confirmed COVID-19 cases are as follows: the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of nasopharyngeal swab is 38.13% (180/472 times), the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of sputum is 48.68% (148/304 times), the positive rate of blood 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test is 3.03% (4/132 times), and the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of feces is 9.83% (24/244 times). The positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in anal swabs is 10.00% (12/120 times). Discussion| In this study, it was found that the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in sputum of 132 patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of nasopharyngeal swabs, and viral nucleic acids were also detected in blood and digestive tract (fecal/anal swabs). Simple detection of nasopharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection positive rate is not high, multi-sample 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection can improve the accuracy, reduce the false negative rate, better guide clinical treatment and evaluate the therapeutic effect.","Wu, Jianguo; Liu, Jiasheng; Li, Shijun; Peng, Zhiyang; Xiao, Zhe; Wang, Xufeng; Yan, Ruicheng; Luo, Jianfei",Travel Med Infect Dis,323,16

Continuous evolution and emergence of new variants of this virus are the major challenges for controlling the disease with routine vaccination. Successful vaccination usually requires the use of a homologous vaccine, which in turn necessitates continuous investigation of the circulating strains. Herein, we performed a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction- (RT-PCR-) based investigation in broiler chicken flocks of the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. IBV was detected in 36.5% of the tested flocks (42 out of 115) from January 2012 to March 2014. Direct sequencing of hypervariable region-3 (HVR-3) of the Spike (S)-1 gene was performed, followed by phylogenetic analysis to determine the circulating IBV genotypes. Four lineages appear to coexist in this region, including the GI-13 or 4/91 IBV (31%), GI-16 or CK/CH/LDL/97I IBV (28.6%), GI-1 or Mass IBV (19%), and GI-23 or Middle East IBV (21.4%). The latter lineage include two subgroups: IS/720/99 IBV (16.7%) and IS/Variant2/98 IBV (4.7%). Some of the detections made in the 4/91 and Mass lineages are expected to belong to the vaccine strains. Lineages without a homologous vaccine in use (CK/CH/LDL/97I and Middle East) represent 50% of the isolates recovered in this study. Based on identity with the vaccine sequences, field observations, and frequent detection, these two lineages appear to be out of coverage of the IBV vaccines used in Saudi Arabia. This is the first time to identify Middle East lineage (IS/720/99 IBV and IS/Variant2/98 IBV) in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia.","Al-Mubarak, Abdullah I. A.; Al-Kubati, Anwar A.

In this study, the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the amino terminal half of the S glycoprotein gene of one Korean field TGEV strain (133) isolated in 1997 and three Korean field TGEV strains (KT2, KT3 and KT4) isolated in 2000 and HKT2 strain, KT2 passaged 104 times in ST cells, were determined. The amino terminal half of the S glycoprotein gene including antigenic sites A, B, C and D, were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Amplified PCR products were cloned, sequenced, and compared with published sequences for non-Korean TGEV strains. Korea TGEV field strains had 98.5–99.5% nucleotide sequence and 97.2–99.0% amino acid sequence similarity with each other. They had 96.5–99.0% nucleotide sequence similarity and 94.9–97.6% amino acid sequence similarity compared to non-Korean TGEV strains. Korean TGEV strains had several specific nucleotide and amino acid sequences which were not found in foreign TGEV or PRCV strains. HKT2 strain differed by 0.89% in nucleotide and 2.03% amino acid sequences compared to original KT2 strain although the regions forming four antigenic sites were not changed. By phylogenetic tree analysis, Korean field TGEV strains were branched into different groups from non-Korean TGEV or PRCV strains. Korean TGEV field strains KT2 and 133 were branched in separate groups that were differentiated from the other Korean TGEV strains. The Korean TGEV strains seemed to be evolved from a separate lineage of TGEV strain.","Kim, Soo Joung; Han, Jeong Hee; Kwon, Hyuk Moo",Vet Microbiol,323,29

Chinese Medicines (CMs) had been used to treat and prevent viral infection pneumonia diseases for thousands of years and had accumulated a large number of clinical experiences and effective prescriptions. Aim of the study : This research aimed to systematically excavate the classical prescriptions of Chinese Medicine (CM), which have been used to prevent and treat Pestilence (Wenbing, Wenyi, Shiyi or Yibing) for long history in China, to obtain the potential prescriptions and ingredients to alternatively treat COVID-19. Materials and methods We developed the screening system based on data mining, molecular docking and network pharmacology. Data mining and association network were used to mine the high-frequency herbs and formulas from ancient prescriptions. Virtual screening for the effective components of high frequency CMs and compatibility Chinese Medicine was explored by a molecular docking approach. Furthermore, network pharmacology method was used to preliminarily uncover the molecule mechanism. Results 574 prescriptions were obtained from 96,606 classical prescriptions with the key words to treat “Warm diseases (Wenbing)”, “Pestilence (Wenyi or Yibing)” or “Epidemic diseases (Shiyi)”. Meanwhile, 40 kinds of CMs, 36 CMs-pairs, 6 triple-CMs-groups existed with high frequency among the 574 prescriptions. Additionally, the key targets of SARS-COV-2, namely 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), were used to dock the main ingredients from the 40 kinds by the LigandFitDock method. A total of 66 compounds components with higher frequency were docked with the COVID-19 targets, which were distributed in 26 kinds of CMs, among which Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma), HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix), Dahuang (Rhei Radix Et Rhizome) and Chaihu (Bupleuri Radix) contain more potential compounds. Network pharmacology results showed that Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix) CMs-pairs could also interact with the targets involving in immune and inflammation diseases. Conclusions These results we obtained probably provided potential candidate CMs formulas or active ingredients to overcome COVID-19. Prospectively, animal experiment and rigorous clinic studies are needed to confirm the potential preventive and treat effect of these CMs and compounds.","Ren, Xia; Shao, Xin-Xin; Li, Xiu-Xue; Jia, Xin-Hua; Song, Tao; Zhou, Wu-Yi; Wang, Peng; Li, Yang; Wang, Xiao-Long; Cui, Qing-Hua; Qiu, Pei-Ju; Zhao, Yan-Gang; Li, Xue-Bo; Zhang, Feng-Cong; Li, Zhen-Yang; Zhong, Yue; Wang, Zhen-Guo; Fu, Xian-Jun",J Ethnopharmacol,323,16

Furthermore, the occurrence of acute and subacute neurological manifestations such as stroke, encephalitis, headache, and seizures are frequently stated in patients with COVID-19. One of the reported neurological complications of severe COVID-19 is the demolition of the myelin sheath. Indeed, the complex immunological dysfunction provides a substrate for the development of demyelination. Nevertheless, few published reports in the literature describe demyelination in subjects with COVID-19.

AIM: To investigate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shedding patterns and its risk factors. METHODS: All laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients with complete medical records admitted to the Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital from January 28, 2020 to March 8, 2020 were included. Among 145 patients (54.5% males; median age, 46.1 years), three (2.1%) died. The bronco-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) had the highest virus load compared with the other samples. The viral load peaked at admission (3.3 × 10(8 )copies) and sharply decreased 10 d after admission. RESULTS: The viral load was associated with prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) duration. Patients in the ICU had significantly longer shedding time compared to those in the wards (P < 0.0001). Age > 60 years [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4-0.9] was an independent risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 shedding, while chloroquine (HR = 22.8; 95%CI: 2.3-224.6) was a protective factor.

We aimed to determine if ambulance clinician compliance with ventilation recommendations could be improved using the Zoll Accuvent real time ventilation feedback device (VFD). METHODS: Participants simulated a two-minute cardiac arrest scenario using a mannequin and defibrillator without ventilation feedback. Eligible for inclusion were all clinicians aged ≥18 years who perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as part of their role, who had completed an internal advanced life support (ALS) refresher. Following familiarisation of a few minutes with the VFD, participants repeated the two-minute scenario with ventilation feedback. Ventilation rate and volume and CPR quality were recorded. Primary outcome was % difference in ventilation compliance with and without feedback. Secondary outcomes were differences between paramedic and non-paramedic clinicians and compliance with chest compression guidelines. RESULTS: One hundred and six participants completed the study. Median ventilation rate without feedback was 10 (IQR 8–14, range 4–30) compared to 9 (IQR 9–9, range 6–17) with feedback; median tidal volume without feedback was 630 mls (IQR 518–725, range 201–1114) compared to 546 mls (IQR 531–560, range 490–750) with feedback. Proportion of clinicians ≥50% compliant with European Resuscitation Council ventilation recommendations were significantly greater with ventilation feedback compared to without, 91% vs. 9%, (McNemars test p = <0.0001). Paramedics out performed non-paramedic clinicians with and without feedback and compression quality was not compromised by using the VFD. CONCLUSIONS: Ambulance clinician baseline ventilation quality was frequently outside of recommendations, but a VFD can ensure treatment is within evidence-based recommendations. Further research is required to validate the use of the VFD in true clinical practice and to evaluate the relationship between improved ventilation quality during OHCA and patient outcomes.","Charlton, Karl; McClelland, Graham; Millican, Karen; Haworth, Daniel; Aitken-Fell, Paul; Norton, Michael",Resusc Plus,323,19

A stochastic model is purposely developed to explicitly account for the entire population (≈ 400000 inhabitants) of Guadeloupe. The available data for Guadeloupe are analysed and combined with general characteristics of the COVID-19 to constrain the parameters of the model. The time-evolution of the number of cases follows the well-known exponential-like model observed at the very beginning of a pandemic outbreak. The exponential growth of the number of infected individuals is controlled by the so-called basic reproductive number, R0, defined as the likely number of additional cases generated by a single infectious case during its infectious period TI. Because of the rather long duration of infectious period (≈ 14 days) a high rate of contamination is sustained during several weeks after the beginning of the containment period. This may constitute a source of discouragement for people restrained to respect strict containment rules. It is then unlikely that, during the containment period, R0 falls to zero. Fortunately, our models shows that the containment effects are not much sensitive to the exact value of R0 provided we have R0 < 0.6. For such conditions, we show that the number of severe and critical cases is highly tempered about 4 to 6 weeks after the beginning of the containment. Also, the maximum number of critical cases (i.e. the cases that may exceed the hospital intensive care capacity) remains near 30 when R0 < 0.6. For a larger R0 = 0.8 a slower decrease of the number of critical cases occurs, leading to a larger number of deceased patients. This last example illustrates the great importance to maintain an as low as possible R0 during and after the containment period. The rather long delay between the beginning of the containment and the appearance of the slowing-down of the rate of contamination puts a particular strength on the communication and sanitary education of people. To be mostly efficient, this communication must be done by a locally recognised medical staff. We believe that this point is a crucial matter of success.","ALLALI, MERIEM; PORTECOP, PATRICK; CARLES, MICHEL; GIBERT, DOMINIQUE",,323,24

Widespread application of this important marker of protective immunity is limited by logistical and technical challenges associated with live virus methods and venous blood collection. To address this gap, we validated an immunoassay-based method for quantifying neutralization of the spike-ACE2 interaction in a single drop of capillary whole blood, collected on filter paper as a dried blood spot (DBS) sample. Samples are eluted overnight and incubated in the presence of spike antigen and ACE2 in a 96-well solid phase plate. Competitive immunoassay with electrochemiluminescent label is used to quantify neutralizing activity. The following measures of assay performance were evaluated: dilution series of confirmed positive and negative samples, agreement with results from matched DBS-serum samples, analysis of results from DBS samples with known COVID-19 status, and precision (intra-assay percent coefficient of variation; %CV) and reliability (inter-assay; %CV). Dilution series produced the expected pattern of dose–response. Agreement between results from serum and DBS samples was high, with concordance correlation = 0.991. Analysis of three control samples across the measurement range indicated acceptable levels of precision and reliability. Median % surrogate neutralization was 46.9 for PCR confirmed convalescent COVID-19 samples and 0.1 for negative samples. Large-scale testing is important for quantifying neutralizing antibodies that can provide protection against COVID-19 in order to estimate the level of immunity in the general population. DBS provides a minimally-invasive, low cost alternative to venous blood collection, and this scalable immunoassay-based method for quantifying inhibition of the spike-ACE2 interaction can be used as a surrogate for virus-based assays to expand testing across a wide range of settings and populations.","Sancilio, Amelia E.; D’Aquila, Richard T.; McNally, Elizabeth M.; Velez, Matthew P.; Ison, Michael G.; Demonbreun, Alexis R.; McDade, Thomas W.",Sci Rep,323,1

The effective number of codons (ENC) and the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) were determined, revealing codon usage bias in the PEDV genome. Principal component analysis (PCA), an ENC plot, and a parity rule 2 (PR2) plot showed that mutation pressure and natural selection have influenced the codon usage bias of the PEDV genomes. Correlation analysis with GRAVY and aromaticity values and neutrality plot analysis indicated that natural selection was the main force influencing the codon usage pattern, while mutation pressure played a minor role.

However, because the value of vaccines tends to accrue to a large extent beyond the vaccinated individual, they are systematically undervalued in many current HTA processes. This is also the case in the UK, where the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is in charge of assessing preventative vaccines, while therapeutic vaccines fall in the realm of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE). To contribute to a forward-looking perspective, we designed a framework to capture the broader value of vaccination. We reviewed the current state of the global vaccines pipeline and selected seven preventative and three therapeutic vaccines that are likely to enter the UK market within five years. We assessed on which value elements the selected vaccines would potentially generate value, and compared those against the novel broader value framework. A review of the current value elements considered by the JCVI and NICE allowed identifying the critical gaps between potential value generation and value recognition. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the broader value of vaccination has been pro-actively assessed for pipeline vaccinations. Our findings show that the existing narrow evaluation frameworks are likely to systematically undervalue the value of potential future vaccines coming to the UK market. This is particularly relevant, where their impact on AMR and other health interventions, and on the productivity of the workforce is of concern. Recommendations to overcome this include an explicit and more consistent inclusion of, and data collection on, the impact of vaccines on AMR and other health interventions by JCVI and NICE; the consideration of a societal perspective and the fiscal impact of vaccines to societies.","Brassel, Simon; Neri, Margherita; O'Neill, Phill; Steuten, Lotte",Vaccine X,323,23

The finding that it serves a counterregulatory function within the traditional renin–angiotensin system, implicating it in cardiometabolic health, has increased its clinical relevance. Focus on ACE2's role in cardiometabolic health has largely centered on its apparent functions in the context of obesity. Interest in ACE2 has become even greater with the discovery that it serves as the cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), opening up numerous mechanisms for deleterious effects of infection. The proliferation of ACE2 within the literature coupled with its dual role in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and obesity necessitates review of the current understanding of ACE2's physiological, pathophysiological, and potential therapeutic functions.

Nevertheless, the possibility of a paediatric patient requiring surgery, especially high-risk aerosol-generating surgery on the airway, while having the SARS-CoV-2 infection may potentially result in problems during the perioperative period due to concerns regarding patient, family, and staff safety. When unplanned and unrehearsed, this scenario may cause delays and efficiency issues. Our aim is to report on an 8-year-old patient with a foreign object lodged in the oesophagus with COVID-19 that required emergency surgery. Case Report. An 8-year-old female patient came to the emergency room with a history of difficulty in swallowing for 12 hours before admission, having accidentally swallowed a metal coin while playing. She did not have any recent history of disease, but her parents had noticed that, for the previous 4 days, she had had a mild fever and dry cough. Her parents and other relatives in the house had no similar complaints, and they assured us they had not been in contact with any suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Our goal was to create a safe paediatric anaesthesia environment with safe working conditions for the surgical team. In this case report, we will describe our approach to patient transport, parental presence, preventions of aerosol risk, personal protection, the anaesthesia induction technique, and postoperative management. CONCLUSION: Safe paediatric anaesthesia, especially in a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure, during the COVID-19 era requires consideration and preparation of both the patient and healthcare provider.

Both natural and synthetic zeolites have been used in animal nutrition mainly to improve performance traits and, based on their fundamental physicochemical properties, they were also tested and found to be efficacious in the prevention of ammonia and heavy metal toxicities, poisonings as well as radioactive elements uptake and metabolic skeletal defects. During the last decade, their utilization as mycotoxin-binding adsorbents has been a topic of considerable interest and many published research data indicate their potential efficacy against different types of mycotoxins either as a primary material or after specific modifications related to their surface properties. Ingested zeolites are involved in many biochemical processes through ion exchange, adsorption and catalysis. Recent findings support their role in the prevention of certain metabolic diseases in dairy cows, as well as their shifting effect on nitrogen excretion from urine to faeces in monogastric animals, which results in lower aerial ammonia concentration in the confinement facilities. Moreover, new evidence provide insights into potential mechanisms involved in zeolites supporting effect on animals suffered from gastrointestinal disturbances, including intestinal parasite infections. All the proposed mechanisms of zeolites’ effects are summarized in the present review and possible focus topics for further research in selected areas are suggested.","Papaioannou, D.; Katsoulos, P.D.; Panousis, N.; Karatzias, H.",Microporous Mesoporous Mater,323,10

This study aims to analyse and to predict the total ED resource consumption out of the patient and consultation characteristics in order to execute performance analysis and evaluate quality improvements. METHODS: Characteristics of ED visits of a large Swiss university hospital were summarized according to acute patient condition factors (e.g. chief complaint, resuscitation bay use, vital parameter deviations), chronic patient conditions (e.g. age, comorbidities, drug intake), and contextual factors (e.g. night-time admission). Univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted with the total ED resource consumption as the dependent variable. RESULTS: In total, 164,729 visits were included in the analysis. Physician resources accounted for the largest proportion (54.8%), followed by radiology (19.2%), and laboratory work-up (16.2%). In the multivariable final model, chief complaint had the highest impact on the total ED resource consumption, followed by resuscitation bay use and admission by ambulance. The impact of age group was small. The multivariable final model was validated (R(2) of 0.54) and a scoring system was derived out of the predictors. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the variation in total ED resource consumption can be predicted by our suggested model in the internal validation, but further studies are needed for external validation. The score developed can be used to calculate benchmarks of an ED and provides leaders in emergency care with a tool that allows them to evaluate resource decisions and to estimate effects of organizational changes.","Müller, Martin; Schechter, Clyde B.; Hautz, Wolf E.; Sauter, Thomas C.; Exadaktylos, Aristomenis K.; Stock, Stephanie; Birrenbach, Tanja",PLoS One,323,24

This study is aimed at comparing the confusion regarding the selection of effective diagnostic methods to make a mutual comparison among existing SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests and at determining the most effective one. Based on available published evidence and clinical practice, diagnostic tests of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were evaluated by multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, namely, fuzzy preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (fuzzy PROMETHEE) and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (fuzzy TOPSIS). Computerized tomography of chest (chest CT), the detection of viral nucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction, cell culture, CoV-19 antigen detection, CoV-19 antibody IgM, CoV-19 antibody IgG, and chest X-ray were evaluated by linguistic fuzzy scale to compare among the diagnostic tests. This scale consists of selected parameters that possessed different weights which were determined by the experts' opinions of the field. The results of our study with both proposed MCDM methods indicated that the most effective diagnosis method of COVID-19 was chest CT. It is interesting to note that the methods that are consistently used in the diagnosis of viral diseases were ranked in second place for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, each country should use appropriate diagnostic solutions according to its own resources. Our findings also show which diagnostic systems can be used in combination.","Sayan, Murat; Sarigul Yildirim, Figen; Sanlidag, Tamer; Uzun, Berna; Uzun Ozsahin, Dilber; Ozsahin, Ilker",Comput Math Methods Med,323,26

Although licensed 10-valent (PCV10) and 13-valent (PCV13) vaccines have considerably reduced mortality and morbidity, a sizeable disease burden attributable to serotypes not contained in these PCVs remains. This study aimed to estimate the annual clinical and economic burden of pneumococcal disease attributable to licensed (PCV10 and PCV13) and investigational PCVs, notably 15-valent (PCV15) and 20-valent (PCV20) vaccines, in 13 countries in children under 5 years of age. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was created to aggregate total cases [inclusive of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), pneumonia, and otitis media (OM)], deaths, and direct costs in each country of interest [stratified by PCV10/PCV13 countries, depending on national immunization programs (NIPs)] over 1 year, using up to the three most recent years of available serotype coverage data. Data inputs were sourced from local databases, surveillance reports, and published literature. RESULTS: In 5 PCV10 NIPs (Austria, Finland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden), most remaining PCV20-type disease was due to PCV13-unique serotypes (30–85%), followed by PCV20-unique (9–50%), PCV15-unique (4–15%), and PCV10-unique (2–14%) serotypes. In 8 PCV13 NIPs (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, United Kingdom), most remaining PCV20-type disease was caused by PCV20-unique serotypes (16–69%), followed by PCV13-unique (11–54%), PCV15-unique (2–33%), and PCV10-unique serotypes (3–19%). Across all countries, PCV20 serotypes caused 3000 to 345,000 cases of disease and cost between $1.3 and $44.9 million USD annually with variability driven by population size, NIP status, and epidemiologic inputs. In aggregate, PCV20 serotypes caused 1,234,000 cases and $213.5 million in annual direct medical costs in children under 5 years of age. CONCLUSION: Despite the success of PCV10 and PCV13 in reducing pneumococcal disease, a substantial clinical and economic burden remains due to serotypes contained in investigational vaccines.

Notably, the Vietnamese capital has mostly relied on the use of face masks and hand sanitizer during travel, instead of requiring physical distancing on buses. This study examines public bus passengers’ levels of compliance with Covid-19 safety measures, and the factors that affect compliance. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were administered between 7 September and 3 October 2020, right after the end of the third wave of Covid-19 in Hanoi on 51 bus routes. Exploratory Factor Analysis was carried out to extract factors from attitudinal statements. The extracted factors, passengers’ socio-demographic traits, and their bus use patterns were modelled to determine which variables lead to more compliance with Covid-19 safety measures. RESULTS: We found that 100% of passengers wore face masks (which were mandated), albeit 11% did so incorrectly, while only 28% of passengers used the hand sanitizer provided by bus operators (which was recommended but not required). In addition, 38% of passengers carried their own bottles of hand sanitizer while travelling, despite a relatively low risk of contracting the virus. Women, older passengers, and urbanites were less likely to sanitise their hands. Frequent bus travellers behaved like the population at large with regard to protective measures against Covid-19. CONCLUSIONS: Hanoi's overall measures - full use of face masks and partial use of hand sanitizer - were sufficient to contain three relatively minor Covid-19 waves while still maintaining regular bus operations most of the time. If other cities were able to reach these levels of compliance, most would be in much better position vis-à-vis public transport use during the pandemic (or an epidemic). Our findings suggest that mandates work much better than awareness raising campaigns, although the latter have a role to play.","Nguyen, Minh Hieu; Pojani, Dorina",J Transp Health,323,4

The adage “old drug, new trick” in this context may suggest the important therapeutic potential of existing drugs. We found that the lopinavir/ritonavir treatment recommended in the fifth edition of the Treatment Plan of China can only help to improve a minority of throat-swab nucleic-acid results (3/15) in hospitals. Our previous use of chloroquine to treat patients with COVID-19 infection showed an improvement in more throat-swab nucleic-acid results (5/10) than the use of lopinavir/ritonavir. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a prospective, open-label, randomized controlled, multicenter clinical study. The study consists of three phases: a screening period, a treatment period of no more than 10 days, and a follow-up period for each participant. Participants with COVID-19 infection who are eligible for selection for the study will be randomly allocated to the trial group or the control group. The control group will be given lopinavir/ritonavir treatment for no more than 10 days. The trial group will be given chloroquine phosphate treatment for no more than 10 days. The primary outcome is the clinical recovery time at no more than 28 days after the completion of therapy and follow-up. The secondary outcomes include the rate of treatment success after the completion of therapy and follow-up, the time of treatment success after no more than 28 days, the rate of serious adverse events during the completion of therapy and follow-up, and the time to return to normal temperature (calculated from the onset of illness) during the completion of therapy and follow-up. Comparisons will be performed using two-sided tests with a statistical significance level of 5%. DISCUSSION: This experiment should reveal the efficacy and safety of using chloroquine versus lopinavir/ritonavir for patients with mild/general COVID-19 infection. If the new treatment including chloroquine shows a higher rate of throat-swab SARS-CoV-2 real-time fluorescent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity and is safe, it could be tested as a future COVID-19 treatment.

Israel, similar to all other nations, was forced to cope with the unknown. “Flattening the curve” of infections has become a common term among specialists and decision makers, while explaining restricting measurements taken toward the population. Israelis, who had previously learned to deal with life under constant security threat, are now facing a new reality. The purpose of the study was to check how Israelis are psychologically affected by and coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. The study included 925 Israelis divided into three groups: ages 18–29, 30–59, and 60–88. The data were collected between March 31 and April 8, 2020, when it was already clear that this is a global plague, the country's borders were closed, and the government's directive for citizens was to remain at home while imposing limitations on the public and private sectors. The current study examined psychological distress among the three age groups as well as the associations between levels of distress, resilience, and coping strategies. Levels of distress were measured via the BSI-18 that measures anxiety, depression, and somatization. Resilience was measured using the Connor-Davidson CD-RISC scale. Coping was measured by the short version of the COPE. Psychological distress was associated with being in a younger age group, being a woman, having economic concerns, use of emotion and problem focused coping, and lower resilience. The study also found that concern for the health of family members was the strongest concern among all age groups but was highest among the younger age group. It was also found that those in the younger age group suffered from higher levels of depression, anxiety, and somatization compared to the older age group. The middle age group suffered from elevated levels of anxiety and somatization compared to the older age group. Although the older age group was the most vulnerable to the coronavirus, in this study age was found to be a protective factor from psychological distress. The results of the study suggest the need to consider the younger age group as a risk group, which hence needs to be addressed as the focus of intervention programs. It appears that the concern for their loved ones takes a heavy toll on the younger generation, and this should be considered a major source of stress.","Shechory Bitton, Mally; Laufer, Avital",Front Public Health,323,4

This paper aims at providing an overview of NPS abuse and the effects on mental health and suicidality issues, by performing a literature review of the current related knowledge, thereby identifying those substances that, more than others, are linked to suicidal behaviors. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive and updated overview of the literature regarding suicidality and NPS categories has been undertaken. An electronic search was performed, including all papers published up to March 2021, using the following keywords “NPS” OR “new psychoactive substances” OR “novel psychoactive substances” OR “synthetic cannabinoids” OR “phenethylamines” OR “synthetic cathinones” OR “tryptamines” OR “piperazines” OR “new synthetic opioids” OR “designer benzodiazepines” AND (“suicide” OR “suicidality”) NOT review NOT animal on the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science online databases. Results: Suicidality and self-injurious behavior appear to be frequently associated with some NPS such as cathinones, synthetic cannabinoids, and new synthetic opioids. The results are organized according to the substances recorded. Conclusion: The growing use of NPS has become a significant clinical issue, causing increasing concern and challenges for clinicians working in both mental health and emergency departments. Thus, considering the associations between NPS and suicidality or self-injurious behaviors, areas where suicide-prevention efforts and strategies might be focused are the early detection, monitoring, and restriction of NPS.","Chiappini, Stefania; Mosca, Alessio; Miuli, Andrea; Santovito, Maria Chiara; Orsolini, Laura; Corkery, John Martin; Guirguis, Amira; Pettorruso, Mauro; Martinotti, Giovanni; Di Giannantonio, Massimo; Schifano, Fabrizio",Medicina (Kaunas),323,0

The number of pipetting operations is lower than state-of-the-art non-adaptive pooling schemes, and is higher than that for the Dorfman's scheme. The proposed schemes can work with substantially smaller group sizes than non-adaptive schemes and are simple to describe. Monte-Carlo simulations using the statistical model in the work of Ghosh et al. (Tapestry) show that 10 infected people in a population of size 961 can be identified with 70.86 tests on the average with a sensitivity of 99.50% and specificity of 99.62%. This is 13.5x, 4.24x, and 1.3x the testing throughput of individual testing, Dorfman's testing, and the Tapestry scheme, respectively.","Heidarzadeh, A.; Narayanan, K. R.",,323,24

However, children can face medical conditions influencing their taste function. Measuring and understanding taste dysfunction in children may foster the development of treatments/interventions mitigating the detrimental effects of taste dysfunction on children’s appetite and quality of life. But measuring loss of taste function requires adequate tools. This review was conducted to 1) provide an overview of etiologies (i.e., disease and iatrogenic) associated with taste dysfunction in a pediatric population; 2) to investigate which tools (psychophysical tests and questionnaires) are available to assess taste function in children; and 3) to identify what tools can be and are actually used in clinical practice. It is concluded that only a minority of available tools to assess taste function in children are readily suitable for a pediatric clinical setting. Considering the profound impact of taste dysfunction in the pediatric setting, developing, and implementing a standard taste test that is sensitive, simple, and practical to use with children is pertinent.","van den Brink, Mirjam; IJpma, Irene; Tissing, Wim J E; Havermans, Remco C",Chem Senses,323,32

KEY FINDINGS: Clinical decision-makers must be informed by the best, most trustworthy, highest-quality, robust evidence. This translates into how much confidence we can have in the research findings and thus be optimally informed for decision-making. The estimates of effect in clinical research depends on the underlying research methodology. COVID-19 disease is presenting global health systems, clinicians, and patients grave challenges. No treatment or prophylaxis currently exists for COVID-19. The overall body of COVID-19 research is very flawed methodologically. An examination of hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin research findings due to the recent media focus revealed very low-quality methodology underpins the research. Vast amounts of time and resources are being allocated to COVID-19 research, and being potentially squandered. WHAT THIS ADDS TO WHAT WAS KNOWN: Flawed methodology and sub-optimal reporting of research findings could lead to biased estimates of effect. This could lead to treatment decisions that are not optimal based on biased estimates which could harm the patient. This article provides specific suggestions for improving on the COVID-19 methods and reporting with a focus on the issues that researchers must consider in their methodology and reporting if we are to have confidence in the estimates of effect. Failure to consider harms in research could be detrimental to the patient. This article focuses on the potential harms when therapeutic agents such as hydroxychloroquine, are being considered. WHAT IS THE IMPLICATION AND WHAT SHOULD CHANGE NOW: Research thus far on finding an optimal therapeutic agent (s) for COVID-19 could be hampered by methodologically flawed research. COVID-19 researchers must immediately and acutely focus on improving their methodology and reporting.","Alexander, Paul Elias; Debono, Victoria Borg; Mammen, Manoj J.; Iorio, Alfonso; Aryal, Komal; Deng, Dianna; Brocard, Eva; Alhazzani, Waleed",J Clin Epidemiol,323,1

Symptoms are often vague, and physical exam findings have proven unreliable as indicators of infection. Therefore, diagnosis typically relies on imaging or nasopharyngeal swabs. The objective of this study was to compare point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) with chest x-ray (CXR) to determine which is the more accurate diagnostic imaging modality for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This was a single-center, prospective, observational study at an urban university hospital with >105,000 patient visits annually. Patients >18 years old, who presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms of COVID-19, were eligible for enrollment. Each patient received a LUS, performed by an emergency medicine resident or attending physician, using a portable, handheld ultrasound and a portable AP CXR after the LUS was completed. High-risk patients or those with an abnormal imaging finding underwent a non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (NCCT) as the diagnostic standard. The primary outcome was the sensitivity and specificity of LUS and of CXR at identifying COVID-19 pneumonia against NCCT as the reference standard. Using a power analysis of 80%, our sample size calculation of 98 patients was based on previous data demonstrating a 20% difference in sensitivities between LUS and CXR at diagnosing pneumonia. Data are presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Data analysis included the chi-square and t tests. Results: 143 consecutive patients with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 were approached and enrolled. 27 patients were considered low-risk by the attending per emergency department guidelines, and 6 patients were admitted for alternate diagnoses without advanced imaging. 110 patients underwent LUS, CXR, and NCCT. 99 LUS and 73 CXRs were interpreted as positive. 81 NCCT were interpreted as positive providing a prevalence of COVID-19 pneumonia of 75% (95% CI 66.0-83.2) in our study population. Sensitivity of LUS was 97.6% (95% CI 91.6-99.7) vs 69.9% (95% CI 58.8-79.5) for CXR. Specificity was 33.3% (95% CI 16.5-54.0) for LUS and 44.4% (95% CI 25.5-64.7) for CXR. LUS positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.46 (95% CI 1.12-1.92) and 0.0723 (95% CI 0.01-0.31), respectively vs 1.26 (95% CI 0.87-1.81) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.39-1.16) for CXR. PPV and NPV for LUS were 81.8% (95% CI 72.8-88.9) and 81.8% (95% CI 48.2-97.7) compared to 79.5% (95% CI 68.4-88.0) and 32.4% (95% CI 18.0-49.8) for CXR. Conclusions: LUS was more sensitive than CXR at identifying COVID-19 pneumonia. LUS using a portable, handheld ultrasound can be a valuable triage screening modality for patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia in diverse clinical settings. [Formula presented]","Gibbons, R.

Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes serious vomiting and diarrhea in suckling piglets. In this study, the role of Ca(2+) to PDCoV infection was investigated. PDCoV infection was found to upregulate intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations of IPI-2I cells. Chelating extracellular Ca(2+) by EGTA inhibited PDCoV replication, and this inhibitory effect was overcome by replenishment with CaCl(2). Treatment with Ca(2+) channel blockers, particularly the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker diltiazem hydrochloride, inhibited PDCoV infection significantly. Mechanistically, diltiazem hydrochloride reduces PDCoV infection by inhibiting the replication step of the viral replication cycle. Additionally, knockdown of CACNA1S, the L-type Ca(2+) voltage-gated channel subunit, inhibited PDCoV replication. The combined results demonstrate that PDCoV modulates calcium influx to favor its replication.","Bai, Dongcheng; Fang, Liurong; Xia, Sijin; Ke, Wenting; Wang, Jing; Wu, Xiaoli; Fang, Puxian; Xiao, Shaobo",Virology,323,20

However, long-standing observations of natural infections with old viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus and newer observations of emerging viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 responsible for COVID-19 suggest that immune immaturity may be beneficial for outcome. Mechanistic studies and studies of patients with inborn errors of immunity have revealed that immune dysregulation reflecting inappropriate antibody and T-cell responses plays a crucial role in causing bystander inflammation and more severe disease. Further evidence supports a role for innate immunity in normally regulating adaptive immune responses. Thus, changes in immune responses that normally occur with age may help explain an apparent protective role of immune immaturity during virus infections.","Shaw, Elana R.; Su, Helen C.",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,323,24

Earlier diagnosis and advances in treatment have improved the life expectancy of IMD patients over the last decades, with the majority of patients now surviving beyond the age of 20. This has created a new challenge: as they grow up, the care of IMD patients' needs to be transferred from metabolic pediatricians to metabolic physicians specialized in treating adults, through a process called “transition.” The purpose of this study was to assess how this transition is managed in Europe: a survey was sent to all 77 centers of the European Reference Network for Hereditary Metabolic Disorders (MetabERN) to collect information and to identify unmet needs regarding the transition process. Data was collected from 63/77 (81%) healthcare providers (HCPs) from 20 EU countries. Responders were mostly metabolic pediatricians; of these, only ~40% have received appropriate training in health issues of adolescent metabolic patients. In most centers (~67%) there is no designated transition coordinator. About 50% of centers provide a written individualized transition protocol, which is standardized in just ~20% of cases. In 77% of centers, pediatricians share a medical summary, transition letter and emergency plan with the adult team and the patient. According to our responders, 11% of patients remain under pediatric care throughout their life. The main challenges identified by HCPs in managing transition are lack of time and shortage of adult metabolic physician positions, while the implementations that are most required for a successful transition include: medical staff dedicated to transition, a transition coordinator, and specific metabolic training for adult physicians. Our study shows that the transition process of IMD patients in Europe is far from standardized and in most cases is inadequate or non-existent. A transition coordinator to facilitate collaboration between the pediatric and adult healthcare teams should be central to any transition program. Standardized operating procedures, together with adequate financial resources and specific training for adult physicians focused on IMDs are the key aspects that must be improved in the rare metabolic field to establish successful transition processes in Europe.","Stepien, Karolina M.; Kieć-Wilk, Beata; Lampe, Christina; Tangeraas, Trine; Cefalo, Graziella; Belmatoug, Nadia; Francisco, Rita; del Toro, Mireia; Wagner, Leona; Lauridsen, Anne-Grethe; Sestini, Sylvia; Weinhold, Nathalie; Hahn, Andreas; Montanari, Chiara; Rovelli, Valentina; Bellettato, Cinzia M.; Paneghetti, Laura; van Lingen, Corine; Scarpa, Maurizio",Front Med (Lausanne),323,4

Unfortunately, it remains poorly implemented in daily practice. Multiple studies have shown that training and support (T&S) programs can increase the use of EIBI. Nonetheless, gains have only been modest and short-term at best. Suggestions have been made to rely more on multicomponent programs that simultaneously address several barriers to the implementation of EIBI. The PINO-project aims to evaluate the added value of such a multicomponent program to improve EIBI delivery in daily practice. METHODS/DESIGN: A quasi-experimental three-arm implementation study in Flanders (Belgium) will assess the effects of tailored T&S to General Practitioners (GPs) with or without community mobilisation on EIBI delivery in general practice. The study lasts 18 months and will take place in three comparable municipalities. In municipality 1 and 2, GPs receive a tailored T&S program. The T&S is theoretically founded and tailored to the GPs’ views, needs and practice characteristics. Furthermore, community actions will be embedded within municipality 1 providing additional, contextual, support. In municipality 3, GPs are offered a minimal intervention to facilitate data collection. The primary outcome is the proportion of adult patients screened for hazardous and harmful alcohol use at the end of an 18-month implementation period. The secondary outcome is the scaling up activity at municipal level in screening rates, as assessed every 3 months, and the proportion of patients who received an additional brief intervention when necessary. Furthermore, the correlation between the opinions and needs of the GP’s, their practice organisation and their EIBI performance will be explored. DISCUSSION: The PINO-project addresses the gap between what is theoretically possible and the current practice. This is an innovative study combining T&S at GP level with community actions. At the same time, it implements and evaluates practice T&S based on the theoretical domains framework.

Several diagnostic strategies are available to identify current infection, rule out infection, identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immune response. Serology tests to detect the presence of antibodies to SARS‐CoV‐2 aim to identify previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and may help to confirm the presence of current infection. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of antibody tests to determine if a person presenting in the community or in primary or secondary care has SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, or has previously had SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and the accuracy of antibody tests for use in seroprevalence surveys. SEARCH METHODS: We undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the COVID‐19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID‐19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. We conducted searches for this review iteration up to 27 April 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated antibody tests (including enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, and lateral flow assays) in people suspected of current or previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection. We also included studies of people either known to have, or not to have SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS‐CoV‐2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests (RT‐PCR) and clinical diagnostic criteria). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed possible bias and applicability of the studies using the QUADAS‐2 tool. We extracted 2x2 contingency table data and present sensitivity and specificity for each antibody (or combination of antibodies) using paired forest plots. We pooled data using random‐effects logistic regression where appropriate, stratifying by time since post‐symptom onset. We tabulated available data by test manufacturer. We have presented uncertainty in estimates of sensitivity and specificity using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS: We included 57 publications reporting on a total of 54 study cohorts with 15,976 samples, of which 8526 were from cases of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Studies were conducted in Asia (n = 38), Europe (n = 15), and the USA and China (n = 1). We identified data from 25 commercial tests and numerous in‐house assays, a small fraction of the 279 antibody assays listed by the Foundation for Innovative Diagnostics. More than half (n = 28) of the studies included were only available as preprints. We had concerns about risk of bias and applicability. Common issues were use of multi‐group designs (n = 29), inclusion of only COVID‐19 cases (n = 19), lack of blinding of the index test (n = 49) and reference standard (n = 29), differential verification (n = 22), and the lack of clarity about participant numbers, characteristics and study exclusions (n = 47). Most studies (n = 44) only included people hospitalised due to suspected or confirmed COVID‐19 infection. There were no studies exclusively in asymptomatic participants. Two‐thirds of the studies (n = 33) defined COVID‐19 cases based on RT‐PCR results alone, ignoring the potential for false‐negative RT‐PCR results. We observed evidence of selective publication of study findings through omission of the identity of tests (n = 5). We observed substantial heterogeneity in sensitivities of IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies, or combinations thereof, for results aggregated across different time periods post‐symptom onset (range 0% to 100% for all target antibodies). We thus based the main results of the review on the 38 studies that stratified results by time since symptom onset. The numbers of individuals contributing data within each study each week are small and are usually not based on tracking the same groups of patients over time. Pooled results for IgG, IgM, IgA, total antibodies and IgG/IgM all showed low sensitivity during the first week since onset of symptoms (all less than 30.1%), rising in the second week and reaching their highest values in the third week. The combination of IgG/IgM had a sensitivity of 30.1% (95% CI 21.4 to 40.7) for 1 to 7 days, 72.2% (95% CI 63.5 to 79.5) for 8 to 14 days, 91.4% (95% CI 87.0 to 94.4) for 15 to 21 days. Estimates of accuracy beyond three weeks are based on smaller sample sizes and fewer studies. For 21 to 35 days, pooled sensitivities for IgG/IgM were 96.0% (95% CI 90.6 to 98.3). There are insufficient studies to estimate sensitivity of tests beyond 35 days post‐symptom onset. Summary specificities (provided in 35 studies) exceeded 98% for all target antibodies with confidence intervals no more than 2 percentage points wide. False‐positive results were more common where COVID‐19 had been suspected and ruled out, but numbers were small and the difference was within the range expected by chance. Assuming a prevalence of 50%, a value considered possible in healthcare workers who have suffered respiratory symptoms, we would anticipate that 43 (28 to 65) would be missed and 7 (3 to 14) would be falsely positive in 1000 people undergoing IgG/IgM testing at days 15 to 21 post‐symptom onset. At a prevalence of 20%, a likely value in surveys in high‐risk settings, 17 (11 to 26) would be missed per 1000 people tested and 10 (5 to 22) would be falsely positive. At a lower prevalence of 5%, a likely value in national surveys, 4 (3 to 7) would be missed per 1000 tested, and 12 (6 to 27) would be falsely positive. Analyses showed small differences in sensitivity between assay type, but methodological concerns and sparse data prevent comparisons between test brands. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of antibody tests is too low in the first week since symptom onset to have a primary role for the diagnosis of COVID‐19, but they may still have a role complementing other testing in individuals presenting later, when RT‐PCR tests are negative, or are not done. Antibody tests are likely to have a useful role for detecting previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infection if used 15 or more days after the onset of symptoms. However, the duration of antibody rises is currently unknown, and we found very little data beyond 35 days post‐symptom onset. We are therefore uncertain about the utility of these tests for seroprevalence surveys for public health management purposes. Concerns about high risk of bias and applicability make it likely that the accuracy of tests when used in clinical care will be lower than reported in the included studies. Sensitivity has mainly been evaluated in hospitalised patients, so it is unclear whether the tests are able to detect lower antibody levels likely seen with milder and asymptomatic COVID‐19 disease. The design, execution and reporting of studies of the accuracy of COVID‐19 tests requires considerable improvement. Studies must report data on sensitivity disaggregated by time since onset of symptoms. COVID‐19‐positive cases who are RT‐PCR‐negative should be included as well as those confirmed RT‐PCR, in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) and China National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (CDC) case definitions. We were only able to obtain data from a small proportion of available tests, and action is needed to ensure that all results of test evaluations are available in the public domain to prevent selective reporting. This is a fast‐moving field and we plan ongoing updates of this living systematic review.","Deeks, Jonathan J; Dinnes, Jacqueline; Takwoingi, Yemisi; Davenport, Clare; Spijker, René; Taylor-Phillips, Sian; Adriano, Ada; Beese, Sophie; Dretzke, Janine; Ferrante di Ruffano, Lavinia; Harris, Isobel M; Price, Malcolm J; Dittrich, Sabine; Emperador, Devy; Hooft, Lotty; Leeflang, Mariska MG; Van den Bruel, Ann",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,323,21

Similarly, antibodies used to prevent or treat viral infections attach to epitopes on virions or on viral proteins expressed on the surface of infected cells. Such drugs and antibodies can therefore be thought of as probes for the detection of viral infections, suggesting that they might be used as radiolabeled tracers to visualize sites of viral replication by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. A current example of this approach is the PET imaging of herpes simplex virus infections, in which the viral thymidine kinase phosphorylates radiolabeled thymidine analogues, trapping them within infected cells. One of many possible future applications might be the use of a radiolabeled hepatitis C protease inhibitor to image infection in animals or humans and provide a quantitative measure of viral burden. This article reviews the basic features of radionuclide imaging and the characteristics of ideal tracer molecules, and discusses how antiviral drugs and antibodies could be evaluated for their suitability as virus-specific imaging probes. The use of labeled drugs as low-dose tracers would provide an alternative application for compounds that have failed to advance to clinical use because of insufficient in vivo potency, an unsuitable pharmacokinetic profile or hepato- or nephrotoxicity.","Bray, Mike; Di Mascio, Michele; de Kok-Mercado, Fabian; Mollura, Daniel J.; Jagoda, Elaine",Antiviral Res,323,1

When the exercise of human dissection is followed within the boundaries of ethics it effectively props an ideal example for the young minds to emulate in the future. Hence in every stage of dissection room activity precious human body needs to be handled in an ethical manner so as to set a standard for the students. The present review is an attempt to collate the recommendations documented by researchers as per ethical guidelines in the context of human dissection. The review highlights on the ethical norms which needs to be adhered to while receiving the human body of a donor and during preservation of the same. It reflects on ideal ethical behaviour in the dissection room during the act of dissection and finally emphasize on the respectful disposal of the human remains in an ethical manner. The intended purpose of this article is to support uniform adoption of the recommendations for ethical handling of human bodies used in anatomical dissection.,"Ghosh, Sanjib Kumar",Ann Anat,323,20

While schools often facilitate mental health support for their students, the demands for online teaching and the uncertainty created by the pandemic make traditional delivery of support through schools challenging. Technology provides a potential way forward. We have developed a digital ecosystem, HABITS, that can be integrated into school and healthcare systems. This has allowed us to deploy specific evidence‐based interventions directly, and through schools, to students and to parents in New Zealand during the current pandemic. Chatbot architecture is particularly suited to rapid iteration to provide specific information while apps can provide more generalised support. While technology can provide some solutions, it is important to be aware of the potential to increase current inequities, with those facing the greatest challenges to health and well‐being, also least able to afford the resources to access digital interventions. Development of an integrated and equitable digital system will take time and collaboration.","Merry, Sally N.; Cargo, Tania; Christie, Grant; Donkin, Liesje; Hetrick, Sarah; Fleming, Terry; Holt‐Quick, Chester; Hopkins, Sarah; Stasiak, Karolina; Warren, Jim",Child Adolesc Ment Health,323,1

In order to keep Covid-19, which has a very high propagation rate, under control, it is necessary to develop faster, low-cost and highly accurate methods, rather than costly Polymerase Chain Reaction test that can yield results in a few hours. In this study, a deep learning-based approach that can detect Covid-19 quickly and with high accuracy on X-ray images, which are common in every hospital and can be obtained at low cost, is proposed. Deep features are extracted from X-Ray images in RGB, CIE Lab and RGB CIE color spaces using DenseNet 121 and EfficientNet B0 pre-trained deep learning architectures and then obtained features are fed into a two-stage classifier approach. Each of the classifiers in the proposed approach performs binary classification. In the first stage, healthy and infected samples are separated, and in the second stage, infected samples are detected as Covid-19 or pneumonia. In the experiments, Bi-LSTM network and well-known ensemble approaches such as Gradient Boosting, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting were used as the classifier model and it was seen that the Bi-LSTM network had a superior performance than other classifiers with 92.489% accuracy.","Uçar, Emine; Atila, Ümit; Uçar, Murat; Akyol, Kemal",Biomed Signal Process Control,323,20

It has the advantages of tracking a concept drift automatically and predicting trend changes in the shortest time, making it important both for algorithmic research and industry. However, industrial data streams contain considerable noise that interferes with detecting weak anomalies. In this paper, the fastest detection algorithm “sliding nesting” is adopted. It is based on calculating the data weight in each window by applying variable weights, while maintaining the method of trend-effective integration accumulation. The new algorithm changes the traditional calculation method of the trend anomaly detection score, which calculates the score in a short window. This algorithm, SNWFD–DS, can detect weak trend abnormalities in the presence of noise interference. Compared with other methods, it has significant advantages. An on-site oil drilling data test shows that this method can significantly reduce delays compared with other methods and can improve the detection accuracy of weak trend anomalies under noise interference.","Li, Guang; Liang, Jing; Yue, Caitong",Entropy (Basel),323,20

In this study, a 7.5 kb fragment of the BRV-1 genome that bracketed the genes for the structural proteins of BRV was amplified by long RT-PCR and the amplicon purified and sequenced directly. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of four open reading frames (ORF) corresponding to the peplomer (S), envelope (M), and nucleocapsid (N) genes, and an ORF for a novel 1.2 kb gene located between the M and N genes. This new gene was identical in nucleotide sequence to the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene of BRV-2. With the exception of this new ORF, BRV-1 manifests 80% nucleotide sequence identity with the torovirus prototype, Berne virus (BEV) in the 7.5 kb region from the 3′ end of the genome that contains the genes for the structural proteins. A 504 base segment containing the ORF for the BRV-1 N gene was amplified by RT-PCR, and cloned into an Escherichia coli expression system. The resulting protein was purified by SDS-PAGE and used to immunize guinea pigs. Hyperimmune serum was reactive with bovine torovirus (BTV) and human torovirus (HTV) antigens. By immunoelectron microscopy, it was shown to aggregate broken but not intact torovirus particles from BTV-positive fecal specimens. By immunoblot, the hyperimmune serum reacted specifically with the 20 kD N proteins of both BTV and HTV, as well as with the expressed N protein. BRV-1 and BRV-2 immune sera from gnotobiotic calves, but not human convalescent sera from HTV-infected patients, reacted with the expressed N protein by immunoblot.

Whether or not SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to liver damage per se remains unknown. Here we reported the clinical characteristics and liver pathological manifestations of COVID-19 patients with liver enzyme abnormality. METHODS: We received 156 patients diagnosed of COVID-19 from two designated centers in China, and compared clinical features between patients with elevated aminotransferase or not. Postmortem liver biopsies were obtained from two cases who had elevated aminotransferase. We investigated the patterns of liver impairment by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, TUNEL assay, and pathological studies. RESULTS: 64 of 156 (41.0%) COVID-19 patients had elevated aminotransferase. The median levels of ALT were 50 U/L vs. 19 U/L, respectively, AST were 45.5 U/L vs. 24 U/L, respectively in abnormal and normal aminotransferase groups. The liver enzyme abnormality was associated with disease severity, as well as a series of laboratory tests including higher A-aDO2, higher GGT, lower albumin, decreased CD4+ T cells and B lymphocytes. Ultrastructural examination identified typical coronavirus particles characterized by spike structure in cytoplasm of hepatocytes in two COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 infected hepatocytes displayed conspicuous mitochondrial swelling, endoplasmic reticulum dilatation, and glycogen granule decrease. Histologically, massive hepatic apoptosis and a certain binuclear hepatocytes were observed. Taken together, both ultrastructural and histological evidence indicated a typical lesion of viral infection. Immunohistochemical results showed scanty CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. No obvious eosinophil infiltration, cholestasis, fibrin deposition, granuloma, massive central necrosis, or interface hepatitis were observed. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver is a crucial cause of hepatic impairment in COVID-19 patients.

This retrospective cohort study used a population-based medical record linkage system and manual chart reviews to identify children with KD in Olmsted County, MN between January 1, 1979-December 31, 2016. Age- and gender-adjusted incidence rates were calculated using the 2010 U.S. White population. 124 children with KD were confirmed during the study period (median age 3.5, 61% male, 85% White, 9% Asian). The overall age- and gender-adjusted incidence rates for all ages and < 5 years old were 9.8 and 21.4 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. There was an overall increase in incidence up to 1994 followed by plateau, except among children between the ages of 1–5 years. There was also an overall increase in incidence among females compared to males. 24% of children had cardiac complications. While the overall incidence of KD in Olmsted County appears to be stable since 1994, the incidence of KD in subgroups of children 1–5 years old and females seems to have increased. Given the rising trends and one-quarter of children developing cardiac complications, further studies identifying factors driving these trends are warranted.","Taslakian, Editt N.; Wi, Chung-IL; Seol, Hee Yun; Boyce, Thomas G.; Johnson, Jonathan N.; Ryu, Euijung; King, Katherine S.; Juhn, Young J.; Choi, Bong Seok",Pediatr Cardiol,323,1

However, few studies have characterized the clinical features and outcomes associated with PIV infections among young children in the Middle East. METHODS: We conducted hospital-based surveillance for ARI among children < 2 years of age in a large referral hospital in Amman, Jordan. We systematically collected clinical data and respiratory specimens for pathogen detection using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We compared clinical features of PIV-associated ARI among individual serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 and among PIV infections compared with other viral ARI and ARI with no virus detected. We also compared the odds of supplemental oxygen use using logistic regression. RESULTS: PIV was detected in 221/3168 (7.0%) children hospitalized with ARI. PIV-3 was the most commonly detected serotype (125/221; 57%). Individual clinical features of PIV infections varied little by individual serotype, although admission diagnosis of ‘croup’ was only associated with PIV-1 and PIV-2. Children with PIV-associated ARI had lower frequency of cough (71% vs 83%; p < 0.001) and wheezing (53% vs 60% p < 0.001) than children with ARI associated with other viruses. We did not find a significant difference in supplemental oxygen use between children with PIV-associated infections (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.12, 95% CI 0.66–1.89, p = 0.68) and infections in which no virus was detected. CONCLUSIONS: PIV is frequently associated with ARI requiring hospitalization in young Jordanian children.

As part of an online questionnaire, 5483 children and adolescents between 6 and 18 years of age were asked about their feelings, fears, worries, and assessments regarding the coronavirus pandemic. As can be seen, children and adolescents are worried about the situation, and girls are more burdened by this across all age groups. The study also clearly shows that the risk of a COVID-19-associated hospitalization is massively overestimated by children and adolescents, similar to adults. In addition, a great lack of perspective caused by the constantly challenging situation is evident across all age groups. Feelings of fury, anger, loneliness, and sadness are reported much more frequently than previously. Last but not least, our study shows an alarming reduction of sleep quality and a drastic increase in self-reported sleep problem already in this young population.

Many institutions have experienced changes in rostering practices and redeployment of trainees to non-surgical services. Examinations, study days, courses, and conferences have been cancelled. These changes have the potential to significantly impact the education and training of surgical trainees. AIM: To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on training, educational, and operative experiences of Irish surgical trainees. METHODS: Surgical trainees were surveyed anonymously regarding changes in working and educational practices since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March 2020. The survey was circulated in May 2020 to both core and higher RCSI surgical trainees, when restrictions were at level five. Questions included previous and current access to operative sessions as well as operative cases, previous and current educational activities, access to senior-led training, and access to simulation-/practical-based training methods. A repeat survey was carried out in October 2020 when restrictions were at level two. RESULTS: Overall, primary and secondary survey response rates were 29% (n = 98/340) and 19.1% (n = 65/340), respectively. At the time of circulation of the second survey, the number of operative sessions attended and cases performed had significantly improved to numbers experienced pre-pandemic (p < 0.0001). Exposure to formal teaching and education sessions returned to pre-COVID levels (p < 0.0001). Initially, 23% of trainees had an examination cancelled; 53% of these trainees have subsequently sat these examinations. Of note 27.7% had courses cancelled, and 97% of these had not been rescheduled. CONCLUSION: Surgical training and education have been significantly impacted in light of COVID-19. This is likely to continue to fluctuate in line with subsequent waves. Significant efforts have to be made to enable trainees to meet educational and operative targets.","Hennessy, Orla; Fowler, Amy Lee; Hennessy, Conor; Brinkman, David; Hogan, Aisling; Nugent, Emmeline; Joyce, Myles",Ir J Med Sci,323,20

One explanation for this differential impact is the distribution of people into occupations that can be performed from home and may provide greater financial security. However, little is known about the nature and scale of shifting home-based work patterns and their geographic distribution, despite this being a likely determinant of the success of geographically defined COVID-19 lockdown strategies. We investigate the hypothesis that people engaged in financially secure employment are better able to adapt to mobility restrictions, due to common occupational factors. In the context of two Australian urban centres, we test this hypothesis by analysing changes to home-based internet usage and quantify the relationship between area-level measures of population income security, the ability to perform job requirements remotely, and the degree of transition to home-based work during COVID-19. Our analysis confirms that financial security in Australia is geographically clustered and concentrated. Income security is also correlated with increased internet traffic during work hours under lockdown, and home-based work patterns that persist post-lockdown. Our findings suggest that geographic diversity in preparedness for government-imposed restrictions should be factored into response planning and provision of social and economic support for residents within lockdown areas.","Zachreson, C.; Martino, E.; Tomko, M.; Shearer, F.

However, small changes in the frequency of one lineage over another are often difficult to interpret because surveillance samples are obtained from a variety of sources. Here, we describe lineage dynamics and phylogenetic relationships using sequences obtained from a random community sample who provided a throat and nose swab for rt-PCR during the first three months of 2021 as part of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study. Overall, diversity decreased during the first quarter of 2021, with the B.1.1.7 lineage (first identified in Kent) predominant, driven by a 0.3 unit higher reproduction number over the prior wild type. During January, positive samples were more likely B.1.1.7 in younger and middle-aged adults (aged 18 to 54) than in other age groups. Although individuals infected with the B.1.1.7 lineage were no more likely to report one or more classic COVID-19 symptoms compared to those infected with wild type, they were more likely to be antibody positive 6 weeks after infection. Viral load was higher in B.1.1.7 infection as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) values, but did not account for the increased rate of testing positive for antibodies. The presence of infections with non-imported B.1.351 lineage (first identified in South Africa) during January, but not during February or March, suggests initial establishment in the community followed by fade-out. However, this occurred during a period of stringent social distancing and targeted public health interventions and does not immediately imply similar lineages could not become established in the future.

Patients with mild symptoms were admitted to Fangcang shelter hospitals for centralized quarantine. We aimed to clarify the medication usage, related adverse reactions, and pharmaceutical interventions in patients with mild COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We innovatively carried out targeted pharmacy services. We provided online and off-line pharmaceutical services to patients in the Fangcang shelter hospital. The use of medication, related adverse reactions, and the effects of pharmaceutical intervention were analyzed. RESULTS: Lower blood lymphocyte count was proposed as the most significant risk factor in patients with mild illness. All patients received antiviral treatment (arbidol, oseltamivir, and ribavirin); 78.4% of patients received antibiotic therapy (moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and cefdinir); patients in the moderate disease group received more antibiotic therapy than those in the mild disease group. Most of the patients were treated with traditional Chinese medicine. Patients with moderate disease preferred to receive sedative hypnotic therapy. Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, arrhythmia, and constipation were the most common adverse reactions. The rate of mild-to-moderate illness in the pharmaceutical intervention and non-intervention groups was 20.6% and 31.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Most patients with mild illness were treated with antiviral, antibiotic, and Chinese medicine therapy. However, attention should be paid to patients with mild illness presenting with hypertension and low lymphocyte count at the onset; these patients are more likely to develop moderate or severe disease. Moreover, there were many drug-related problems in Fangcang shelter hospital; pharmaceutical care might contribute to alleviate the progress of the patient’s condition. Pharmacists should be prepared to provide skilled and effective services to patients, with the aim to ensure medication safety and promote the overall control of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cheng, Fang; Li, Qiang; Han, Yong; Shi, Chen; Wu, Sanlan; Xu, Qiling; Zeng, Fang; Zhang, Yu",Infect Drug Resist,323,16

Here, we first tested the in vitro antiviral activity of Griffithsin against PRRSV. Griffithsin exerted strong saccharide-dependent antiviral activity against PRRSV, probably through interactions with glycans on the surface of PRRSV that interfered with virus entry. Furthermore we revealed that Griffithsin’s action on PRRSV involved blocking viral adsorption, and it had no effect on viral penetration. Besides Our findings also suggested that Griffithsin may interfere with cell-to-cell spread to prevent virus transmission.

Based on 44 publicly available datasets and two clinical studies of our own design, we discovered and validated a four-gene expression signature in whole blood, indicative of a general host systemic response to many types of viral infection. The signature’s genes are: Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), Interleukin 16 (IL16), 2′,5′-Oligoadenylate Synthetase Like (OASL), and Adhesion G Protein Coupled Receptor E5 (ADGRE5). In each of 13 validation datasets encompassing human, macaque, chimpanzee, pig, mouse, rat and all seven Baltimore virus classification groups, the signature provides statistically significant (p < 0.05) discrimination between viral and non-viral conditions. The signature may have clinical utility for differentiating host systemic inflammation (SI) due to viral versus bacterial or non-infectious causes.","Sampson, D. L.; Fox, B. A.; Yager, T.

The psychological behavioural patterns of the family were as follows – creativity and high IQ, hypersexual behaviour, reduced appetite and eating behaviour, insomnia and reduced sleep patterns, increased tendency for spirituality, increased tendency for addiction, less of bonding and affectionate behaviour and left handedness. Digoxin, an endogenous Na(+)–K(+) ATPase inhibitor secreted by the hypothalamus, was found to be elevated and RBC membrane Na(+)–K(+) ATPase activity was found to be reduced in all the disorders and in the indexed family studied. Hypothalamic digoxin can modulate conscious perception and its dysfunction may lead to schizophrenia. Digoxin can also preferentially upregulate tryptophan transport over tyrosine resulting in increased levels of depolarising tryptophan catabolites – serotonin, quinolinic acid, strychnine and nicotine and decreased levels of hyperpolarising tyrosine catabolites dopamine, noradrenaline and morphine contributing to membrane Na(+)–K(+) ATPase inhibition in all the above disorders and the indexed family. Digoxin induced membrane Na(+)–K(+) ATPase inhibition can result in increased intracellular Ca(2+) and reduced Mg(++) levels leading to glutamate excitotoxicity, oncogene activation and immune activation. Digoxin induced altered Ca(++)/Mg(++) ratios, reduced ubiquinone and increased dolichol can affect glycoconjugate metabolism, membrane formation and structure and mitochondrial function leading to the diverse disorders described above including those in the indexed family. The isoprenoid pathway and neurotransmitter patterns were compared in right-handed/left hemispheric dominant and left-handed/right hemispheric dominant individuals. The biochemical patterns in the indexed family and the diverse disorders studied correlated with those obtained in right hemispheric dominance. The hyperdigoxinemic state indicates right hemispheric dominance. Hypothalamic digoxin can thus function as the master conductor of the neuroimmunoendocrine orchestra and co-ordinate the functions of various cellular organelles.","Kurup, Ravi Kumar; Kurup, Parameswara Achutha",Med Hypotheses,323,21

As a result, there is a critical need for rapid and continuously updated access to the latest molecular data in a format in which all data can be quickly cross-referenced and compared. We adapted our genome browser visualization tool to the viral genome for this purpose. Molecular data, curated from published studies or from database submissions, are mapped to the viral genome and grouped together into “annotation tracks” where they can be visualized along the linear map of the viral genome sequence and programmatically downloaded in standard format for analysis. RESULTS: The UCSC Genome Browser for SARS-CoV-2 (https://genome.ucsc.edu/covid19.html) provides continuously updated access to the mutations in the many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID and the international nucleotide sequencing databases, displayed alongside phylogenetic trees. These data are augmented with alignments of bat, pangolin, and other animal and human coronavirus genomes, including per-base evolutionary rate analysis. All available annotations are cross-referenced on the virus genome, including those from major databases (PDB, RFAM, IEDB, UniProt) as well as up-to-date individual results from preprints. Annotated data include predicted and validated immune epitopes, promising antibodies, RT-PCR and sequencing primers, CRISPR guides (from research, diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies), and points of interaction between human and viral genes. As a community resource, any user can add manual annotations which are quality checked and shared publicly on the browser the next day. CONCLUSIONS: We invite all investigators to contribute additional data and annotations to this resource to accelerate research and development activities globally. Contact us at genome-www@soe.ucsc.edu with data suggestions or requests for support for adding data. Rapid sharing of data will accelerate SARS-CoV-2 research, especially when researchers take time to integrate their data with those from other labs on a widely-used community browser platform with standardized machine-readable data formats, such as the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser.","Fernandes, Jason D.; Hinrichs, Angie S.; Clawson, Hiram; Gonzalez, Jairo Navarro; Lee, Brian T.; Nassar, Luis R.; Raney, Brian J.; Rosenbloom, Kate R.; Nerli, Santrupti; Rao, Arjun; Schmelter, Daniel; Zweig, Ann S.; Lowe, Todd M.; Ares, Manuel; Corbet-Detig, Russ; Kent, W.

However, cognitive decline is often misdiagnosed or missed completely in hospital admissions, resulting in delays in detection and treatment for patients. Quick and simple screening tools such as the Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS) could help provide early detection and faster treatment times for such patients. Data from Queen Elizabeth Hospital Kings Lynn showed that only 56.8% of patients over the age of 75 were being assessed for cognitive function on admission, while the national targets are set at 90%. METHODS: A multi-cycle, trust wide, quality improvement project was used to improve screening outcomes for dementia in QEHKL. A baseline measure of screening was taken by QEHKL coding department. Five PDSA (Plan Do Study Act) cycles were undertaken, implementing interventions to aid screening at each stage. Examples include improved medical clerking booklets, trust wide education and allocated ward ‘Dementia Champions’. Performance was assessed by auditors, through patient notes and discharge letters. RESULTS: Over a 4-month period, 432 patient notes were inspected on six medical wards. Results after interventions showed a significant rise in Dementia Screening from 58.7% to 89.8%. AMTS completion was 70.7% in September 2020 on medical wards which improved to 85.7% in November 2020. Results were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic however, COVID wards were excluded. CONCLUSION: The QI project has highlighted that education and accessible tools can improve cognitive screening numbers. An important note is, due to increased pressures during the COVID pandemic it is plausible that screening rates were adversely affected. Despite this, our figures still show positive improvement. The next cycle of our project includes surgical wards and we expect by the time of presentation to have this data to show.","Ashraf, M; Mahmood, A; Honney, K",Age Ageing,323,8

Effective vaccines remain the most promising approach to counter SARS-CoV-2. Yet, while promising results are emerging from COVID-19 vaccine trials, the need for multiple doses and the challenges associated with the widespread distribution and administration of vaccines remain concerns. Here, we engineered the coat protein of the MS2 bacteriophage and generated nanoparticles displaying multiple copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. The use of these nanoparticles as vaccines generated high neutralizing antibody titers and protected Syrian hamsters from a challenge with SARS-CoV-2 after a single immunization with no infectious virus detected in the lungs. This nanoparticle-based vaccine platform thus provides protection after a single immunization and may be broadly applicable for protecting against SARS-CoV-2 and future pathogens with pandemic potential.","Chiba, Shiho; Frey, Steven J.; Halfmann, Peter J.; Kuroda, Makoto; Maemura, Tadashi; Yang, Jie E.; Wright, Elizabeth R.; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Kane, Ravi S.",Commun Biol,323,1

The noncovalent enzyme–inhibitor complex was simulated using classical molecular dynamics techniques and the pose of the inhibitor in the active site was compared to that of the natural substrate, a peptide containing the Gln–Ser scissile bond. The formation of the covalent enzyme–inhibitor complex was then simulated using hybrid QM/MM free energy methods. After binding, the reaction mechanism was found to be composed of two steps: (i) the activation of the catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) to form an ion pair and (ii) a Michael addition where the attack of the Sγ atom of Cys145 to the Cβ atom of the inhibitor precedes the water-mediated proton transfer from His41 to the Cα atom. The microscopic description of protease inhibition by N3 obtained from our simulations is strongly supported by the excellent agreement between the estimated activation free energy and the value derived from kinetic experiments. Comparison with the acylation reaction of a peptide substrate suggests that N3-based inhibitors could be improved by adding chemical modifications that could facilitate the formation of the catalytic dyad ion pair.","Ramos-Guzmán, Carlos A.; Ruiz-Pernía, J.

CQ has been used for decades for the treatment and prophylaxis against malaria in endemic countries. It is readily available and has also been manufactured in these countries. CQ is cheap, stable under field conditions and has been well tolerated as an antimalarial. This experience could be adapted to deploy CQ or HCQ for prophylaxis or treatment of COVID19 if strong evidence could be generated for these uses.

We divide UK measures into two broad categories. First, there are measures designed to reduce the use of streets and public spaces – eg rules requiring people to stay at home except in tightly prescribed circumstances and measures providing specific support (including food delivery and priority online shopping) for people designated as clinically extremely’ vulnerable’. Second, there are measures designed to control the behaviour of people using streets and public space – eg rules on physical distancing and the use of face coverings. We explore the disability-related concerns associated with these types of measure.

A total of 11,000 doses of influenza vaccine, single-dose prefilled syringes, were provided free to HCWs at 29 selected hospitals, clinics, and research institutes in four provinces: Hanoi, Khanh Hoa, Dak Lak and Ho Chi Minh City. METHODS: Before the campaign, a workshop was organized to discuss an implementation plan including technical requirements, cold chain, uptake reporting, and surveillance for adverse events following immunization. All sites distributed communication materials and encouraged their staff to register for vaccination. Following immunization sessions, sites sent reports on uptake and adverse events following immunization. Left-over vaccine was transferred to other sites to maximize vaccine use. RESULTS: The average uptake was 57% for all health care workers, with 11 sites achieving 90% and above. These 11 sites were small with less than 500 staff, including 5 primary hospitals, 3 preventive medicine units, and 2 referral hospitals. Among the six biggest sites with over 1000 staff, four sites had the lowest uptake (14–47%). Most of the high-uptake sites were from the central to the south; only one site, a referral hospital, was from the north. After redistribution of left-over vaccine, only 130 vaccine doses (1.2%) were not used and destroyed. Based on factors that affected uptake, including registration levels, differing communication strategies, availability of vaccination, and commitment by health facility leaders, we recommended ways to increase health care worker coverage; recommendations to improve reporting adverse events following immunization were also made. CONCLUSIONS: The project demonstrated that it was feasible to conduct influenza vaccination campaigns among health care workers in Vietnam. Improvements in promotion of registration, more intense pre-planning, especially at larger facilities, and wider, more consistent availability of communication materials will result in increased efficiency and coverage in this program’s future expansion.","Ha, Nga T.; Nguyen, Thoa T.

Ventilator sharing has been suggested as a crisis standard of care strategy to increase availability of mechanical ventilation. The safety and practicality of shared ventilation in patients is unknown. We designed and evaluated a system whereby one mechanical ventilator can be used to simultaneously ventilate two patients who have different lung compliances using a custom manufactured flow control valve to allow for individual adjustment of tidal volume and airway pressure for each patient. Methods: The system was first evaluated in a simulation lab using two human patient simulators under expected clinical conditions. It was then tested in an observational study of four patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Two separately ventilated COVID-19 patients were connected to a single ventilator for one hour. This intervention was repeated in a second pair of patients. Ventilatory parameters (tidal volume, peak airway pressures, compliance) were recorded at five minute intervals during both studys. Arterial blood gases were taken at zero, thirty, and sixty minutes. The primary outcome was maintenance of stable acid-base status and oxygenation during shared ventilation. Results: Two male and two female patients, age range 32-56 yrs, participated. Ideal body weight and driving pressure were markedly different among patients. All patients demonstrated stable physiology and ventilation for the duration of shared ventilation. In one patient tidal volume was increased after 30 minutes to correct a respiratory acidosis. Conclusions: Differential ventilation using a single ventilator and a split breathing circuit with flow control valves is possible. A single ventilator could feasibly be used to safely ventilate two COVID-19 patients simultaneously as a bridge to full ventilatory support.","Levin, M.; Chen, M.

Our objective was to rapidly summarize the emerging evidence of new ways of working in the care of older people during this period. We conducted an exploration of the emerging evidence within the timeframe of 1 March 2020 to 11 May 2020. To capture a broad perspective, we undertook thematic analysis of Twitter data which was extracted through a broad search for new ways of working in health and social care. For a more in-depth focus on the health and social care of older people, we undertook a systematic scoping of newspapers using the Nexis UK database. We undertook a validation workshop with members of the interprofessional working group of the Irish National Integrated Care Programme for Older People, and with researchers. A total of 317 tweets were extracted related to six new ways of working. There was evidence of using telehealth to provide ongoing care to patients; interprofessional work; team meetings using online platforms; trust and collaboration within teams; as well as teams feeling empowered to change at a local level. 34 newspaper articles were extracted related to new ways of working in the care of older people, originating in England (n = 17), Wales (n = 6), Scotland (n = 6), Ireland (n = 4) and Germany (n = 1). Four main themes were captured that focused on role expansion, innovations in communication, environmental restructuring and enablement. The results of this exploration of emerging evidence show that health and social care teams can transform very rapidly. Much of the change was based on goodwill as a response to the pandemic. Further analysis of empirical evidence of changing practices should include the perspectives of older people and should capture the resources needed to sustain innovations, as well as evaluate gaps in service provision.","Ní Shé, Éidín; O’Donnell, Deirdre; O’Shea, Marie; Stokes, Diarmuid",Int J Environ Res Public Health,323,16

Yet, the COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates bound many children to their available home spaces for learning, movement, and development. The exact effect this mandate had on children's physical activity may vary among families. Objective: To understand, from the perspective of parents, how the COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates affected children's physical activity, while also considering families' socioeconomic status. Design: Open-ended survey. Setting: Online. Method: Data were collected from 321 parents living in the United States of America. Parents answered an open-ended prompt to describe their children's physical activity during COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates. Following data collection, inductive and deductive content analysis examined patterns in the data. Results: Analyses indicated that shelter-in-place mandates restricted children's opportunities for physical activity. However, if families had access to outdoor spaces or equipment, they could encourage and support more physical activity opportunities than those without. Families in the lower-income bracket had less access to outdoor space and subsequently those children had fewer opportunities to be physically active. Parents supported their children's physical activity through their involvement and encouragement.

The SARS-COV-2 spike protein receptor binding region (RBD) plays an important role in the process of viral binding receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and membrane fusion, making it an ideal target for vaccine development. In this study, we designed three different RBD-conjugated nanoparticles vaccine candidates, RBD-Ferritin (24-mer), RBD-mi3 (60-mer) and RBD-I53-50 (120-mer), with the application of covalent bond linking by SpyTag-SpyCatcher system. It was demonstrated that the neutralizing capability of sera from mice immunized with three RBD-conjugated nanoparticles adjuvanted with AddaVax or Sigma Systerm Adjuvant (SAS) after each immunization was ~8-to 120-fold greater than monomeric RBD group in SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and authentic virus neutralization assay. Most importantly, sera from RBD-conjugated NPs groups more efficiently blocked the binding of RBD to ACE2 or neutralizing antibody in vitro, a further proof of promising immunization effect. Besides, high physical stability and flexibility in assembly consolidated the benefit for rapid scale-up production of vaccine. These results supported that our designed SARS-CoV-2 RBD-conjugated nanoparticle was competitive vaccine candidate and the carrier nanoparticles could be adopted as universal platform for future vaccine development.","Kang, Yin-Feng; Sun, Cong; Zhuang, Zhen; Yuan, Run-Yu; Zheng, Qing-Bing; Li, Jiang-Ping; Zhou, Ping-Ping; Chen, Xin-Chun; Zhang, Xiao; Yu, Xiao-Hui; Kong, Xiang-Wei; Zhu, Qian-Ying; Xu, Miao; Zhong, Nan-Shan; Zeng, Yi-Xin; Feng, Guo-Kai; Ke, Chang-Wen; Zhao, Jin-Cun; Zeng, Mu-Sheng",bioRxiv,323,23

SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 100 million people worldwide, leading to more than 3.5 million deaths. Initially, the clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection were thought to be restricted to the respiratory system. However, further studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can also afflict multiple other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. The number of gastrointestinal and neurological manifestations after SARS-CoV-2 infection has been rapidly increasing. Most importantly, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 often exhibit comorbid symptoms in the gastrointestinal and neurological systems. This review aims to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 may affect the nervous system by invading the gastrointestinal system. We hope that this review can provide novel ideas for the clinical treatment of the neurological symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and references for developing prevention and treatment strategies.","Xu, Jiali; Wu, Zifeng; Zhang, Mi; Liu, Shijiang; Zhou, Ling; Yang, Chun; Liu, Cunming",Front Neurosci,323,1

RESEARCH QUESTION: Among adult volunteers, do either cloth masks or surgical masks impair oxygenation or ventilation either at rest or during physical activity? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: With IRB approval and informed consent, we measured heart rate (HR), transcutaneous carbon dioxide (CO(2)) tension and oxygen levels (SpO(2)) at the conclusion of six 10-minute phases: sitting quietly and walking briskly without a mask, sitting quietly and walking briskly while wearing a cloth mask, and sitting quietly and walking briskly while wearing a surgical mask. Brisk walking required at least a 10bpm increase in heart rate. Occurrences of hypoxemia (decrease in SpO(2) of ≥3% from baseline to a value of ≤94%) and hypercarbia (increase in CO(2) tension of ≥5 mmHg from baseline to a value of ≥46 mmHg) in individual subjects were collected. Wilcoxon signed-rank was used for pairwise comparisons among values for the whole cohort (e.g. walking without a mask versus walking with a cloth mask). RESULTS: Among 50 adult volunteers (median age 33 years; 32% with a co-morbidity), there were no episodes of hypoxemia or hypercarbia (0%; 95% confidence interval 0–1.9%). In paired comparisons, there were no statistically significant differences in either CO(2) or SpO(2) between baseline measurements without a mask and those while wearing either kind of mask mask, both at rest and after walking briskly for ten minutes. INTERPRETATION: The risk of pathologic gas exchange impairment with cloth masks and surgical masks is near-zero in the general adult population.","Shein, Steven L.; Whitticar, Sofie; Mascho, Kira K.; Pace, Elizabeth; Speicher, Richard; Deakins, Kathleen",PLoS One,323,28

Due to the reduction of cytokine release, it is effective in chronic graft-versus-host disease, and its use has also been suggested in autoimmune diseases and in prevention of COVID-19-associated lung damage. Despite this effect on the immune response, we report a severe hypersensitivity reaction in a 76-year-old male patient diagnosed with prolymphocytic leukemia. Four weeks after the ibrutinib start, non-oliguric acute kidney injury with proteinuria and microscopic hematuria developed and that was accompanied by lower limb purpuras and paresthesia. Renal biopsy revealed acute interstitial nephritis. Employing 1 mg/kg methylprednisolone administration, serum creatinine decreased from 365 μmol/L to 125 μmol/L at 11 days and the proteinuria-hematuria as well as the purpura, paresthesia resolved. Three months later at stabile eGFR of 56 ml/min/1.73 m(2) methylprednisolone was withdrawn and a rituximab-venetoclax treatment was initiated without side effects. We conclude that despite the beneficial effect on cytokines response in Th1 direction, ibrutinib can cause acute interstitial nephritis. Early detection, discontinuation of ibrutinib, glucocorticoid administration may help to better preserve renal function, thereby lowering the risk of potential subsequent kidney injury.","Markóth, Csilla; File, Ibolya; Szász, Róbert; Bidiga, László; Balla, József; Mátyus, János",Renal failure,323,22

However, outcomes remain poor. Given the likely benefit of cyclosporine due to its antiviral and immunomodulatory effect, we have been using it as a strategy in KTRs diagnosed with SARS‐CoV‐2. We studied 29 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who were admitted to our institution with COVID‐19 between March,15‐ April, 24(th), 2020. Mycophenolate and/or mTORi were discontinued in all patients. Two therapeutic strategies were compared: Group 1) minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (N=6); Group 2) cyclosporine‐based therapy (N=23), with 15 patients switched from tacrolimus. Hydroxychloroquine was considered in both strategies but antivirals in none. Six patients died after a respiratory distress (20.6%). Five required mechanical ventilation (17.2 %), and three could be weaned. Nineteen patients had an uneventful recovery (65.5%). In group 1, 3/6 patients died (50%) and 1/6 required invasive mechanical ventilation (IVM) (16.7%). In group 2, three patients died 3/23 (12.5%).

In this study, we sought to determine the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines among health care workers in Ghana. Using a cross-sectional design, we collected data from 234 health care workers through a self-administered online survey from 16 January to 15 February 2021. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses using binary logistic regression were performed using STATA version 15. The results showed that 39.3% of health care workers had the intention of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Factors such as sex, category of health care workers, relative being diagnosed with COVID-19, and trust in the accuracy of the measures taken by the government in the fight against COVID-19 proved to be significant predictors of the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine. Concerns about the safety of vaccines and the adverse side effects of the vaccine were identified as the main reasons why health care workers would decline uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in Ghana. The self-reported low intention of health care workers to accept the COVID-19 vaccine in Ghana requires the urgent call of the Government of Ghana and other stakeholders to critically address health care workers' concerns about the safety and adverse side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, as this would increase vaccine uptake. Interventions must also take into consideration sex and the category of health care workers to achieve the desired results.
