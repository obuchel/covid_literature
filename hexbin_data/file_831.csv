The report offers a comprehensive analysis of how national governments, educational, and health care institutions, public agencies, and private partners must collaborate over the coming decade to meet the anticipated growing stress on the nursing workforce. It also details the case to overcome geographic, economic, and demographic disparities that block access to effective, affordable universal health care. As an early participant in the research and preparation of this document, the National League for Nursing has been a vocal advocate for one of its key themes: serious investment in nursing education and leadership as a vital link in cocreating equitable, sustainable access to outstanding, inclusive, culturally sensitive universal health care.","Malone, Beverly",Nursing administration quarterly,831,1

This study examines the breadth and quality of AMS survey tools measuring the stewardship knowledge, perceptions and practices (KPP) of CPs and analyse survey outcomes. Following PRISMA-ScR checklist and Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework seven medical databases were searched. Two reviewers independently screened the literatures, assessed quality of surveys and KPP outcomes were analysed and described. Ten surveys were identified that assessed CPs' AMS perceptions (n = 7) and practices (n = 8) but none that assessed AMS knowledge. Three survey tools had been formally validated. Most CPs perceived that AMS improved patient care (median 86.0%, IQR, 83.3-93.5%, n = 6), and reduced inappropriate antibiotic use (84.0%, IQR, 83-85%, n = 2). CPs collaborated with prescribers for infection control (54.7%, IQR 34.8-63.2%, n = 4) and for uncertain antibiotic treatment (77.0%, IQR 55.2-77.8%, n = 5). CPs educated patients (53.0%, IQR, 43.2-67.4%, n = 5) and screened guideline-compliance of antimicrobial prescriptions (47.5%, IQR, 25.2-58.3%, n = 3). Guidelines, training, interactions with prescribers, and reimbursement models were major barriers to CP-led AMS implementation. A limited number of validated survey tools are available to assess AMS perceptions and practices of CPs. AMS survey tools require further development to assess stewardship knowledge, stewardship targets, and implementation by CPs.","Saha, Sajal K; Barton, Chris; Promite, Shukla; Mazza, Danielle",Antibiotics,831,1

DESIGN Systematic review. METHODS We searched Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO and pre-identified websites. Studies were included if they were published in English on or after 2002 through May 2017, and evaluated interventions that integrated, at an organizational level, screening and/or treatment for HIV and OUD in any care setting in any country. RESULTS Twenty-nine articles met criteria for inclusion, including 23 unique studies: six took place in HIV care settings, 12 in opioid treatment settings, and five elsewhere. Eight involved screening strategies, 22 involved treatment strategies, and seven involved strategies that encompassed screening and treatment. Randomized controlled studies demonstrated low to moderate risk of bias and observational studies demonstrated fair to good quality. Studies in HIV care settings (n = 6) identified HIV- and OUD-related clinical benefits with the use of buprenorphine/naloxone for OUD. No studies in HIV care settings focused on screening for OUD. Studies in opioid treatment settings (n = 12) identified improving HIV screening uptake and clinical benefits with antiretroviral therapy when provided on-site. Counseling intensity for OUD medication adherence or HIV-related risk reduction was not associated with clinical benefits. CONCLUSION Screening for HIV can be effectively delivered in opioid treatment settings, yet there is a need to identify optimal OUD screening strategies in HIV care settings. Strategies integrating the provision of medications for HIV and for OUD should be expanded and should not be contingent on resources available for behavioral interventions. REGISTRATION A protocol for record eligibility was developed a priori and was registered in the PROSPERO database of systematic reviews (registration number CRD42017069314).","Oldfield, Benjamin J; Mu√±oz, Nicolas; Mcgovern, Mark P; Funaro, Melissa; Villanueva, Merceditas; Tetrault, Jeanette M; Edelman, E Jennifer",AIDS,831,1

The goal of this study is to identify patient, institutional and paramedic risk factors for non-optimal resource utilization for interfacility transfers of injured adult patients transported by air ambulance to a LTC. METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study of adult emergent interfacility transports via Ornge with data collected on patient demographics, clinical status, sending facilities, transport details and paramedic qualifications. A logistic regression model was used to analyze data. RESULTS 1777 injured patients undergoing transport with Ornge were analyzed with 805 of these undergoing non-optimal transport. Patients who had an optimal resource use were found to be older and mechanically ventilated. Risk factors increasing odds of non-optimal transport included patients transported from a nursing station (OR 1.94), transport with primary or advanced care paramedics (OR 6.57 and 1.44, respectively) and transport between both 0800-1700 and 1700-0000 (OR 1.40 and 1.54, respectively). The median delay to arrival to receiving facility if a patient had a non-optimal resource use was 40 minutes. CONCLUSIONS Three main risk factors were identified in this study. We believe that nursing stations as a sending facility and type of paramedics crew transporting patients resulted in non-optimal resource utilization primarily due to triage of lower acuity patients. However the timing of day is more likely to be a resource availability issue and something that can be further studied and potentially improved moving forward.","Quirion, Andrew; Ahghari, Mahvareh; Nolan, Brodie",CJEM,831,5

A representative sample of US residents characterized scientists' relations with one of four employers: federal government agency, large business corporation, advocacy group (nonprofit seeking to influence policy), or university. Overall, they held moderate views of how much scientists and employers shared motivations, interests, and values, and of whether employers tried to change-and succeeded in changing-how scientist employees did their scientific work. Judgments differed little across employers. Best predictors of these views were belief in scientific positivism, subjective knowledge of science, and age. These findings suggest scientific authority in the United States is not immediately threatened by public beliefs that employers skew their scientific employees' work, although that might differ for specific topics or demographic sub-groups.","Johnson, Branden B; Dieckmann, Nathan F",Public understanding of science,831,31

In preterm neonates, these differences are even more evident, due to the lower level of organ maturation and to ongoing cell differentiation. One of the most remarkable finding in preterm tissues is the presence of huge amounts of stem/progenitor cells in multiple organs, including kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In other organs, such as liver, the completely different burden of cell types in preterm infants is mainly related to the different function of the liver during gestation, mainly focused on hematopoiesis, a function that is taken by bone marrow after birth. Our preliminary studies showed that the antigens expressed by stem/progenitors differ significantly from one organ to the next. Moreover, within each developing human tissue, reactivity for different stem cell markers also changes during gestation, according with the multiple differentiation steps encountered by each progenitor during development. A better knowledge of stem/progenitor cells of preterms will allow neonatologists to boost preterm organ maturation, favoring the differentiation of the multiple cells types that characterize each organ in at term neonates.","Fanni, D; Gerosa, C; Loddo, C; Castagnola, M; Fanos, V; Zaffanello, M; Faa, G",Cell regeneration,831,31

Light-propulsion occurs as consequence of the coupling between the chirality of polymeric particles - left (L)- or right (R)-type - and the circularly-polarized light that irradiates them. Irradiation with light that has the same helicity as the particle material leads to a circular cooperative vortical motion between the chiral Brownian particles. In contrast, opposite circular-polarization does not induce such coupling among the particles but only affects their Brownian motion. The mean angular momentum of each particle has a value and sign that distinguishes between chiral activity dynamics and typical Brownian motion. These outcomes have relevant implications for chiral separation technologies and provide new strategies for optical torque tunability in mesoscopic optical array systems, micro- and nanofabrication of light-activated engines with selective control and collective motion.","Hern√°ndez, Ra√∫l Josu√©; Sevilla, Francisco J; Mazzulla, Alfredo; Pagliusi, Pasquale; Pellizzi, Nicola; Cipparrone, Gabriella",Soft matter,831,1

This systematic review collects studies up to 2019 about the beneficial effects of photobiomodulation as a therapy for treating psychological disorders and a tool for modulating cognitive processes. This technique is mostly used for the treatment of depression and stress, as well as to study its effects on psychological variables in healthy subjects. Despite the lack of parameters used, photobiomodulation seems to achieve enough brain penetration to produce beneficial effects in healthy subjects and patients with multiple pathologies. The best parameters are the wavelengths of 810 nm for the treatment of depression and 1064 nm for cognitive enhancement, along with a scalp irradiance of 250 mW/cm2 and a scalp yield of 60 J/cm2.

However, when patients have a treatment preference, randomisation may influence participation and outcomes (eg, external and internal validity). The aim of this study was to assess the influence of patients' preference in RCTs by analysing partially randomised patient preference trials (RPPT); an RCT and preference cohort combined. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analyses. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES RPPTs published between January 2005 and October 2018 reporting on allocation of patients to randomised and preference cohorts were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent reviewers extracted data. The main outcomes were the difference in external validity (participation and baseline characteristics) and internal validity (lost to follow-up, crossover and the primary outcome) between the randomised and the preference cohort within each RPPT, compared in a meta-regression using a Wald test. Risk of bias was not assessed, as no quality assessment for RPPTs has yet been developed. RESULTS In total, 117 of 3734 identified articles met screening criteria and 44 were eligible (24 873 patients). The participation rate in RPPTs was >95% in 14 trials (range: 48%-100%) and the randomisation refusal rate was >50% in 26 trials (range: 19%-99%). Higher education, female, older age, race and prior experience with one treatment arm were characteristics of patients declining randomisation. The lost to follow-up and cross-over rate were significantly higher in the randomised cohort compared with the preference cohort. Following the meta-analysis, the reported primary outcomes were comparable between both cohorts of the RPPTs, mean difference 0.093 (95% CI -0.178 to 0.364, p=0.502). CONCLUSIONS Patients' preference led to a substantial proportion of a specific patient group refusing randomisation, while it did not influence the primary outcome within an RPPT. Therefore, RPPTs could increase external validity without compromising the internal validity compared with RCTs.

OBJECTIVES The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the rapid adoption of telemedicine in spine surgery. This study sought to determine the extent of adoption and global perspectives on telemedicine in spine surgery. METHODS All members of AO Spine International were emailed an anonymous survey covering the participant's experiences with and perceptions of telemedicine. Descriptive statistics were used to depict responses. Responses were compared among regions. RESULTS 485 spine surgeons participated in the survey. Telemedicine usage rose from <10.0% to >39.0% of all visits. A majority of providers (60.5%) performed at least one telemedicine visit. The format of ""telemedicine"" varied widely by region: European (50.0%) and African (45.2%) surgeons were more likely to use phone calls, whereas North (66.7%) and South American (77.0%) surgeons more commonly used video (P < 0.001). North American providers used telemedicine the most during COVID-19 (>60.0% of all visits). 81.9% of all providers ""agreed/strongly agreed"" telemedicine was easy to use. Respondents tended to ""agree"" that imaging review, the initial appointment, and postoperative care could be performed using telemedicine. Almost all (95.4%) surgeons preferred at least one in-person visit prior to the day of surgery. CONCLUSION Our study noted significant geographical differences in the rate of telemedicine adoption and the platform of telemedicine utilized. The results suggest a significant increase in telemedicine utilization, particularly in North America. Spine surgeons found telemedicine feasible for imaging review, initial visits, and follow-up visits although the vast majority still preferred at least one in-person preoperative visit.","Riew, Grant; Lovecchio, Francis; Samartzis, Dino; Louie, Philip K; Germscheid, Niccole; An, Howard; Cheung, Jason Pui Yin; Chutkan, Norman; Mallow, Gary Michael; Neva, Marko H; Phillips, Frank M; Sciubba, Daniel; El-Sharkawi, Mohammad; Valacco, Marcelo; McCarthy, Michael H; Makhni, Melvin; Iyer, Sravisht",Global spine journal,831,19

Current systems use sensors that require constant physical contact with the user, which may result in discomfort or lack of adherence. In the present study, we evaluated the accuracy of a new contact-free system to monitor heart and respiratory rate. Study participants were measured simultaneously using two devices: a contact-free optical system that measures nano-vibrations and movements (investigational device, ""Gili Pro BioSensor"") and a standard reference bed-side monitor, inclusive of an electrocardiogram and capnograph modules (Mindray¬Æ). Co-primary endpoints included HR and RR accuracy in subjects without active arrhythmias for HR, and for all study populations for RR (i.e., for subjects with and without active arrhythmias). Confirmatory secondary endpoints included HR scored continuously for all study populations, inclusive of subjects with arrhythmias. The present study included 115 patients who completed study procedures. Mean age was 66 ¬± 14.6 (range 29-93) with 60% males, 31% obese patients (i.e., BMI > 30 kg/m2, range 17-44) and 56% measured in a chair.

Observations relevant to the risks of ADE of disease require careful review at this critical point in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. At present, no clinical findings, immunologic assays or biomarkers are known to differentiate any severe viral infection from immune-enhanced disease, whether by antibodies, T cells or intrinsic host responses. In vitro systems and animal models do not predict the risk of ADE of disease, in part because protective and potentially detrimental antibody-mediated mechanisms are the same, and designing animal models depends on understanding how antiviral host responses may become harmful in people. The implications of our lack of knowledge are twofold. First, comprehensive studies are urgently needed to define clinical correlates of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Second, since we cannot predict ADE of disease reliably after either vaccination or treatment with antibodies, regardless of what virus is the causative agent, it will be essential to depend on careful analysis of safety in humans as immune interventions for COVID-19 disease move forward.","Arvin, Ann M; Fink, Katja; Schmid, Michael A; Cathcart, Andrea; Spreafico, Roberto; Havenar-Daughton, Colin; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Corti, Davide; Virgin, Herbert W",Nature,831,30

However, most reported UGTs suffer from low regiospecificity toward the OH and COOH groups of pentacyclic triterpenoids, which significantly decreases the reaction efficiency. Here, two new UGTs (UGT73C33 and UGT73F24) were discovered in Glycyrrhiza uralensis. UGT73C33 showed high activity but poor regioselectivity toward the C-3 OH and C-30 COOH of pentacyclic triterpenoid, producing three glucosides. UGT73F24 showed rigid regioselectivity toward C-3 OH of typical pentacyclic triterpenoids producing only C-3 O-glucosylated derivatives. In addition, UGT73C33 and UGT73F24 showed a broad substrate scope toward typical flavonoids with various sugar donors. Next, the substrate recognition mechanism of UGT73F24 toward glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) and UDP-glucose was investigated. Two key residues, I23 and L84, were identified to determine activity, and site-directed mutagenesis of UGT73F24-I23G/L84N increased the activity by 4.1-fold. Furthermore, three in vitro GA glycosylation systems with UDP-recycling were constructed, and high yields of GA-3-O-Glc (1.25 mM), GA-30-O-Glc (0.61 mM) and GA-di-Glc (0.26 mM) were obtained. The de novo biosynthesis of GA-3-O-glucose (26.31 mg/L) was also obtained in engineered yeast. This article is protected by copyright.

Our objectives were to determine duration of antimicrobial treatment provided to patients who have bacteremia in ICUs, to assess pathogen/patient factors related to treatment duration, and to assess the relationship between treatment duration and survival. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTINGS Fourteen ICUs across Canada. PATIENTS Patients with bacteremia and were present in the ICU at the time culture reported positive. INTERVENTIONS Duration of antimicrobial treatment for patients who had bacteremia in ICU. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Among 1,202 ICU patients with bacteremia, the median duration of treatment was 14 days, but with wide variability (interquartile range, 9-17.5). Most patient characteristics were not associated with treatment duration. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the only pathogens associated with shorter treatment (odds ratio, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.51-5.26). The urinary tract was the only source of infection associated with a trend toward lower likelihood of shorter treatment (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.42-1.08); an unknown source of infection was associated with a greater likelihood of shorter treatment (odds ratio, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.17-3.91). The association of treatment duration and survival was unstable when analyzed based on timing of death. CONCLUSIONS Critically ill patients who have bacteremia typically receive long courses of antimicrobials. Most patient/pathogen characteristics are not associated with treatment duration; survivor bias precludes a valid assessment of the association between treatment duration and survival. A definitive randomized controlled trial is needed to compare shorter versus longer antimicrobial treatment in patients who have bacteremia.","Daneman, Nick; Rishu, Asgar H; Xiong, Wei; Bagshaw, Sean M; Dodek, Peter; Hall, Richard; Kumar, Anand; Lamontagne, Francois; Lauzier, Francois; Marshall, John; Martin, Claudio M; McIntyre, Lauralyn; Muscedere, John; Reynolds, Steve; Stelfox, Henry T; Cook, Deborah J; Fowler, Robert A",Critical care medicine,831,17

Here, we show distinct antibody responses in children and adults after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Adult COVID-19 cohorts had anti-spike (S) IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies, as well as anti-nucleocapsid (N) IgG antibody, while children with and without MIS-C had reduced breadth of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, predominantly generating IgG antibodies specific for the S protein but not the N protein. Moreover, children with and without MIS-C had reduced neutralizing activity as compared to both adult COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response. These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children independent of whether they develop MIS-C, with implications for developing age-targeted strategies for testing and protecting the population.","Weisberg, Stuart P; Connors, Thomas J; Zhu, Yun; Baldwin, Matthew R; Lin, Wen-Hsuan; Wontakal, Sandeep; Szabo, Peter A; Wells, Steven B; Dogra, Pranay; Gray, Joshua; Idzikowski, Emma; Stelitano, Debora; Bovier, Francesca T; Davis-Porada, Julia; Matsumoto, Rei; Poon, Maya Meimei Li; Chait, Michael; Mathieu, Cyrille; Horvat, Branka; Decimo, Didier; Hudson, Krystalyn E; Zotti, Flavia Dei; Bitan, Zachary C; La Carpia, Francesca; Ferrara, Stephen A; Mace, Emily; Milner, Joshua; Moscona, Anne; Hod, Eldad; Porotto, Matteo; Farber, Donna L",Nature immunology,831,20

Duodenojejunal bypass supports the foregut theory; however, its efficacy when used alone is not yet established. Methods During the period from January 2008 to December 2009, patients who underwent laparoscopic duodenojejunal bypass (LDJB) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with or without morbid obesity were included. Patients who had a follow-up for less than 3 years were excluded. Patient baseline characteristics, change of body weight, body mass index (BMI), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and diabetic treatments were analyzed. Results In total, 8 LDJB and 20 LRYGB patients were analyzed. The LDJB group had more number of male patients than the LRYGB group (LDJB 75% vs. LRYGB 30%, P = 0.030). Baseline BMI in the LRYGB group was higher than in the LDJB group (LDJB 27.0 ¬± 2.5 vs. LRYGB 32.6 ¬± 3.4, P < 0.001). Age, DM duration, baseline HbA1c, and C-peptide levels were similar. Longer operation time was needed to perform LDJB (LDJB 367.5 ¬± 120.2 vs. LRYGB 232.9 ¬± 41.1, P < 0.001), but no differences were observed in the hospital stay and complication rate between the 2 groups. At the third year of follow-up, the T2DM remission rate was observed in 40% of patients in the LRYGB group and 12.5% of patients in the LDJB group. Conclusion LDJB is not an effective method for controlling T2DM compared with LRYGB. Foregut theory may not be the main mechanism of diabetic control during bariatric surgery.","Kim, Dong Jin; Paik, Kwang Yeol; Kim, Mee Kyoung; Kim, Eungkook; Kim, Wook",Annals of surgical treatment and research,831,1

It is intuitively appealing specifically for patients with Crohn's disease (CD) as its minimal invasiveness favors cosmesis and facilitates any future (re)operation. METHODS Consecutive patients presenting either electively or urgently for resectional surgery for CD over a 36 month period were considered for SPLS using, by preference, a transumbilical 'Surgical Glove Port'. Standard, straight laparoscopic instrumentation was used without additional resources. RESULTS Of 33 consecutive, unselected patients, 28 (92%) had their procedure initiated by SPLS including those needing urgent intervention (n=15) and those with prior abdominal operation (n=8), obstruction (n=7), mass (n=6), fistula (n=6) and/or abscess (n=4). The median (range) age and BMI of the patients were 31 (17-69) years and 21.3 (18.6-28) kg/m2 respectively. 31 had ileocolonic resection (6 with recurrent disease) while two underwent segmental colectomy. No-one suffered intraoperative or anastomotic complication. Both conversion (15%) and postoperative complication (13 Clavian-Dindo complications - I: 8; II: 2; IIIa: 3) rates were predominantly reflective of patient and disease complexity. Median (range) postoperative day of discharge was 6 (3-33) overall and 5 (3-18) in those completed by SPLS. There was one early readmission (for infectiouscolitis) and median follow-up is now 21 months. CONCLUSIONS Complex and recurrent Crohn's resections can be performed by SPLS in the majority of patients presenting elective or urgently for surgery. The Surgical Glove Port performs capably and, by minimizing cost, can facilitate broad embrace of this approach.","Moftah, Mohamed; Nazour, Fady; Cunningham, Melanie; Cahill, Ronan A",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,831,27

The analysis of the association of selected socio-demographic and clinical parameters on the presence and severity of psychological distress was also performed. Methods: The study involved 91 patients applying with a medical history supportive of COVID-19 infection. According to the hospitalization criteria and diagnostic result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test certainty of the disease, three groups were created. Patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results were consisted of 31 hospitalized subjects. To assess the applicant psychological state, a specially developed questionnaire was used, as the presence and severities of the symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Results: Statistically, a significantly higher average level of depression and a higher incidence of anxiety were demonstrated among applicants in the Covid-19 pandemic (% 24 and % 44). Also a higher level of anxiety was demonstrated in hospitalized patients compared with the outpatient group. Different from the presence of depression symptoms, the presence of anxiety symptoms was associated independently with hypertension in our study group OR 2.6 (95% CI, 0.99-6.78) P = .04). Conclusions: In the aftermath of COVID-19 outbreak both anxiety and depression are common psychological disorders.

METHODS A total of 43 first-line medical staff and 149 suspected and confirmed cases with COVID-19 [18 cases in medical observation period, 17 cases of mild type (cold dampness and stagnation in the lung), 24 cases of ordinary type (cold-dampness accumulated in the lung) and 90 cases in recovery period (qi deficiency of spleen and lung)] were included. A non-contact doctor-patient interactive diagnosis and treatment platform was established for the treatment of COVID-19 with indirect moxibustion plaster based on mobile internet. By the platform, the patients were instructed to use indirect moxibustion plaster in treatment. For the first-line medical staff and patients in the medical observation period, Zusanli (ST 36), Qihai (CV 6) and Zhongwan (CV 12) were selected. For the mild cases (cold dampness and stagnation in the lung) and the cases of ordinary type (cold-dampness accumulated in the lung), Hegu (LI 4), Taichong (LR 3), Zusanli (ST 36) and Guanyuan (CV 4) were selected. In the recovery period (qi deficiency of spleen and lung), Dazhui (GV 14), Feishu (BL 13), Geshu (BL 17), Zusanli (ST 36) and Kongzui (LU 6) were used. The treatment was given once daily for 40 min each time. The intervention lasted for 10 days. After intervention, the infection rate and the improvement in the symptoms and psychological status of COVID-19 were observed in clinical first-line medical staff and COVID-19 patients. RESULTS In 10 days of intervention with indirect moxibustion plaster, there was ""zero"" infection among medical staff. Of 43 first-line physicians and nurses, 33 cases had some physical symptoms and psychological discomforts, mainly as low back pain, poor sleep and anxiety. After treatment, regarding the improvements in the symptoms and psychological discomforts, the effective rate was 78.8% (26/33) and the curative rate was 36.4% (12/33). Regarding the improvements in psychological discomforts, the effective rate was 58.3% (14/24) and the curative rate was 37.5 (9/24). Of 149 patients, 133 cases had the symptoms and psychological discomforts. After treatment, regarding the improvements in the symptoms and psychological discomforts, the effective rate was 81.2% (108/133) and the curative rate was 34.6% (46/133).

Such efforts are hampered by insufficient data on primary healthcare (PHC) contributions by community pharmacists. The study aimed to identify PHC services offered by community pharmacists; assess impact of technologies on PHC service quality; and evaluate factors influencing management of PHC services in Nigeria. METHODS A descriptive cross-sectional survey of 321 community pharmacies and 642 clients was undertaken between April and August, 2019. Semi-structured pre-tested questionnaires were administered on randomly-selected community pharmacists and clients. Interviews were conducted with key informants. Data were summarized using frequency and percentages while weighted averages on 5-point ordinal scales and chi-square tests were used to identify weights and associations between variables respectively at P<.050. RESULTS Response rates of pharmacists and clients were 74.7% (N=321) and 100% (N=642); while their median ages were 39.41 and 51.20 years respectively. Community pharmacists offered services in all eight domains of PHC, especially supply of medicines for treating of endemic diseases (mean weighted average [MWA]=4.59), and disease prevention (4.54) but least of vaccine administration (2.39). Blood glucose screening devices were the most adopted technology with significant impact on service quality (œá2 6.86, P=.030). Major challenges to management of PHC services were poor awareness of pharmacists' roles (4.31) and lack of integration with the PHC infrastructure (4.31). Capacity constraints in finances (4.11), technologies (4.09), and human resources (3.99) were significant. However, major facilitators were pharmacists' managerial skills (4.35), and strong client relationships (4.27). CONCLUSION In Nigeria, community pharmacists offered important PHC services. Deploying technologies were associated with improved service quality. If community pharmacists are integrated in the national PHC architecture and financial incentives are provided, their competences and goodwill would enhance the achievement of universal health coverage.","Ihekoronye, Maduabuchi R; Osemene, Kanayo P",International journal of health policy and management,831,1

However, to date, prospective studies are lacking. Moreover, it is important to identify which factors modulate the stress response to the pandemic. Previously, sense of coherence (SOC) has emerged as a particularly important resistance factor. OBJECTIVE This prospective study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and to investigate the ability of pre-outbreak SOC levels to predict changes in psychopathological symptoms. METHODS This study assessed psychopathological symptoms and SOC before and after the COVID-19 outbreak as well as post-outbreak COVID-19-related traumatic distress in a German-speaking sample (n =1,591). Bivariate latent change score (BLCS) modeling was used to analyze pre- to post-outbreak changes in psychopathological symptoms and the ability of SOC to predict symptom changes. RESULTS Overall, there was no change in psychopathological symptoms. However, on an individual-respondent level, 10% experienced a clinically significant increase in psychopathological symptoms and 15% met cut-off criteria for COVID-19-related traumatic distress. Using BLCS modeling, we identified a high-stress group experiencing an increase in psychopathological symptoms and a decrease in SOC and a low-stress group showing the reversed pattern. Changes in SOC and psychopathological symptoms were predicted by pre-outbreak SOC and psychopathological symptom levels. CONCLUSIONS Although mental health was stable in most respondents, a small group of respondents characterized by low levels of SOC experienced increased psychopathological symptoms from pre- to post-outbreak. Thus, SOC training might be a promising approach to enhance the resistance to stressors.","Sch√§fer, Sarah K; Sopp, M Roxanne; Schanz, Christian G; Staginnus, Marlene; G√∂ritz, Anja S; Michael, Tanja",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,831,1

The two cases occurred in a husband and wife; the husband is the pastor at a local church (church A). The couple (the index cases) attended church-related events during March 6-8, and developed nonspecific respiratory symptoms and fever on March 10 (wife) and 11 (husband). Before his symptoms had developed, the husband attended a Bible study group on March 11.

The bacteriophage Phi6 is an enveloped viral surrogate commonly used to study viability. To investigate how viability changes during the evaporation of droplets on polypropylene, we conducted experiments using a fixed initial Phi6 concentration while systematically varying the culture concentration and composition (by amendment with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.08 wt % BSA, or 0.5 wt % SDS). The results were consistent with the well-founded relative humidity (RH) effect on virus viability; however, the measured viability change was greater than that previously reported for droplets containing either inorganic salts or proteins alone, and the protein effects diverged in 1√ó Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). We attribute this discrepancy to changes in virus distribution during droplet evaporation that arise due to the variable solute drying patterns (i.e., the ""coffee-ring"" effect) that are a function of the droplet biochemical composition. To test this hypothesis, we used surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) imaging and three types of gold nanoparticles (pH nanoprobe, positively charged (AuNPs(+)), and negatively charged (AuNPs(-))) as physical surrogates for Phi6 and determined that lower DMEM concentrations, as well as lower protein concentrations, suppressed the coffee-ring effect. This result was observed irrespective of particle surface charge. The trends in the coffee-ring effect correlate well with the measured changes in virus infectivity. The correlation suggests that conditions resulting in more concentrated coffee rings provide protective effects against inactivation when viruses and proteins aggregate.","Huang, Qishen; Wang, Wei; Vikesland, Peter J",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,831,30

Methylene blue, a potent antioxidant, can inhibit the generation of free radicals. This research aimed to study the protective effect of methylene blue against the cisplatin-induced toxicity of the reproductive system in rats. 35 male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control group, the cisplatin group (a single dose of 5 mg/kg cisplatin), the low-dose and high-dose methylene blue + cisplatin (2 and 4 mg/kg of methylene blue, respectively, for 7 days) and the methylene blue group (4 mg/kg of methylene blue, for 7 days). The treatments were applied through intraperitoneal injection. Cisplatin treatment reduced the sperm parameters and serum testosterone levels significantly. Methylene blue treatment increased the sperm count (p < .001), viability (p < .001) and motility (p < .001) compared to the cisplatin group. The methylene blue group showed a significant increase in the levels of testosterone compared to the cisplatin group (p < .001) and reverted histopathological changes in cisplatin-treated groups. Immunohistochemical evaluation of the caspase-3 protein revealed that the treatment with methylene blue has significant anti-apoptotic effects on testicular tissue damage. In conclusion, methylene blue can attenuate the cisplatin-induced histological damages and improve the sperm parameters.","Gholami Jourabi, Fatemeh; Yari, Siamak; Amiri, Parsa; Heidarianpour, Ali; Hashemi, Hadis",Andrologia,831,1

Cue integration approaches divide SoA into an implicit level, mostly relying on prospective sensorimotor signals, and an explicit level, resulting from an integration of sensorimotor and contextual cues based on their reliability. Integration mechanisms at each level and the contribution of implicit to explicit SoA remain underspecified. In a task of movements with visual outcomes, we tested the effect of social context (contextual cue) and sensory prediction congruency (retrospective sensorimotor cue) over implicit (intentional binding) and explicit (verbal judgments) SoA. Our results suggest that prospective sensorimotor cues determine implicit SoA. At the explicit level, retrospective sensorimotor cues and contextual cues are partly integrated in an additive way, but contextual cues can also act as a heuristic if sensorimotor cues are highly unreliable. We also found no significant association between implicit and explicit SoA.","Lafleur, Alexis; Souli√®res, Isabelle; Forgeot d'Arc, Baudouin",Consciousness and cognition,831,1

The resistance of these devices is not well described, and the information provided by manufacturers is incomplete. METHODS We compared the resistance of 3 colorimetric ETCO2 detectors (Neo-StatCO2, Pedi-Cap, and Mini StatCO2,) and 2 mainstream capnograph sensors (EMMA infant airway adapter 17449 and neonatal/infant airway adapter YG-213T). Endotracheal tubes, 2.5-4.0-mm inner diameter (Portex) were measured as a reference range. A differential pressure transducer was placed between the device and a T-piece resuscitator. The other side of the device was open to air. Resistance to flow was tested at 1-10 L/min. Resistance was calculated as the change in pressure over change in flow and expressed as cm H2O/L/s. RESULTS There was a significantly higher mean resistance across all flows tested for the Neo-StatCO2 compared with the other ETCO2 devices (P < .001). There was a 6-fold difference between the least and most resistive colorimetric detectors. At the commonly utilized flow of 10 L/min, the resistance of the Neo-StatCO2 was 61.1 cm H2O/L/s, comparable with that of a 3.0 endotracheal tube, which we measured at 62.7 cm H2O/L/s. The resistance values of the Pedi-Cap and Mini StatCO2 were 9.9 and 8.4 cm H2O/L/s, respectively. Those of the EMMA and YG-213T were 7.1 and 2.6 cm H2O/L/s, respectively. CONCLUSIONS We found significant differences in resistance between devices used to detect ETCO2 during resuscitation of premature infants. Future trials are needed to determine the effects of this resistance on work of breathing, particularly on very premature newborns receiving mask CPAP.","Brown, Melissa K; Lazarus, Danielle V; Gonzales, Sarah R; Rich, Wade D; Wozniak, Madeline J; Poeltler, Debra M; Katheria, Anup C",Respiratory care,831,13

Recent research suggests that this new disease in children and adolescents is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. It is a generalized inflammatory reaction suggestive of a likely autoimmune etiology. Symptoms of PIMS-TS are diverse and wide ranging. The disorder develops in children and adolescents as a result of dysregulation of the immune system, but the exact pathogenesis of PIMS-TS remains unknown. Consequently, the most effective types of therapy include supportive care, symptomatic and immunomodulating treatment.

By comparison with the mRNA editing sites of other paramyxoviruses, two editing sites were predicted for bPIV3; site a to express the D protein, and site b to express the V protein. Examination of the bPIV3 mRNAs, however, indicates that site b is non-functional whereas site a operates frequently. Insertions at site a give rise to both V and D protein mRNAs, because a very broad distribution of Gs is added when insertions occur. This broad distribution is very different from the editing sites of Sendai virus or SV5, where predominantly one form of edited mRNA containing either a one or two G insertion respectively is created, to access the single overlapping ORF of these viruses. A model is proposed to explain how paramyxoviruses control the range of G insertions on that fraction of the mRNAs where insertions occur. The bPIV3 P gene is unique as far as we know, in that a sizeable portion of the gene expresses all 3 reading frames as protein. bPIV3 apparently does this from a single editing site by removing the constraints which control the number of slippage rounds which take place.","Pelet, T; Curran, J; Kolakofsky, D",EMBO J,831,1

CONCLUSION Conclusions: Despite previous concerns about the increased risk of Covid-19 among asthmatics, most studies have not shown an increase in Covid-19 incidence among asthmatics compared to the general population. A large number of studies that have investigate the role of concomitant asthma in the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19, show conflicting results and indicate numerous factors that may affect these processes, so there is a need for large-scale studies to adjust the result to concomitant factors, which will assess the true impact of asthma on susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. Based on the recommendations of GINA 2020 regarding the management of asthma patients under Covid-19, potential protective effects of asthma therapy and the high risk of exacerbations when discontinuing basic therapy, we consider it appropriate to continue taking asthma patients therapy of asthma during a pandemic.","Kochuieva, Maryna N; Psarova, Valentyna H; Shklyar, Sergey P; Oparin, Aleksey A",Wiadomosci lekarskie,831,1

Endometriosis involving the rectus abdominis muscle on the trocar port site is a rare event; until now, only 16 cases have been reported in the literature. The majority of cases were associated with previous abdominal surgery such as diagnostic laparoscopy, cyst excision, appendectomy, myomectomy, or cholecystectomy. We review all the reported cases of this unusual form of extrapelvic endometriosis. CASE REPORT We report a new case of abdominal wall endometriosis at the trocar port site in the rectus abdominis muscle in a woman who had undergone 2 laparoscopies for endometriosis in the 3 years before coming to our attention. The diagnosis was made by sonography. We performed a surgical resection of the lesion with a free macroscopic margin of 5-10 mm. CONCLUSION Endometriosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any abdominal swelling.

In experimental models, their use in tendon surgery is still under investigation. This study looks at the use of barbed sutures in a porcine model for fascial repair when compared with traditional absorbable suture to further extend their clinical use. METHODS Six animals were included in this study. Each had two paramedian incisions, down to the fascia at the junction between the lateral edge of the rectus abdominis muscle and the transverse abdominis/oblique muscles of the abdominal wall. One fascial incision was closed with 2-0 Quill polydioxanone barbed suture and the other was closed with the control suture 1-0 PDS II (polydioxanone). The overlying skin was closed with Quill polydioxanone barbed suture for both incisions. At 6 weeks, the fascia was excised and the suture lines were tested for tensile strength. RESULTS There were no wound infections and no incisional hernias. The Quill polydioxanone barbed suture had a mean tissue tensile strength of 265.59 N (range, 206.86 to 306.38 N) and the control suture (polydioxanone) had a mean tissue tensile strength of 227.28 N (range, 132.79 to 290.35 N). The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.341). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that barbed sutures for fascial repair have equivalent tensile strength when compared with traditional nonbarbed sutures, with no adverse events such as wound dehiscence or incisional hernia. This preclinical study lends support to the practice of using barbed sutures for indications such as rectus sheath plication.","Oni, Georgette; Brown, Spencer A; Kenkel, Jeffrey M",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,831,7

Sharing structural and behavioral similarities with its ancestors [SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)], SARS-CoV-2 has lower fatality but faster transmission. We have gone through a long path to recognize SARS and MERS, therefore our knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 is not raw. Various responses of the immune system account for the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Given the innate immune response as the front line of defense, it is immediately activated after the virus entry. Consequently, adaptive immune response is activated to eradicate the virus. However, this does not occur in every case and immune response is the main culprit causing the pathological manifestations of COVID-19. Lethal forms of the disease are correlated with inefficient and/or insufficient immune responses associated with cytokine storm. Current therapeutic approach for COVID-19 is in favor of suppressing extreme inflammatory responses, while maintaining the immune system alert and responsive against the virus. This could be contributing along with administration of antiviral drugs in such patients. Furthermore, supplementation with different compounds, such as vitamin D, has been tested to modulate the immune system responses. A thorough understanding of chronological events in COVID-19 contributing to the development of a highly efficient treatment has not figured out yet. This review focuses on the virus-immune system interaction as well as currently available and potential therapeutic approaches targeting immune system in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Ebrahimi, Negin; Aslani, Saeed; Babaie, Farhad; Hemmatzadeh, Maryam; Hosseinzadeh, Ramin; Joneidi, Zeinab; Mehdizadeh Tourzani, Zahra; Pakravan, Nafiseh; Mohammadi, Hamed",Int Immunopharmacol,831,16
