382,382,382,Peptide-Mediated Liposomal Drug Delivery System Targeting Tumor Blood Vessels in Anticancer Therapy,12.274098,6.200438,2010-05-05,"Solid tumors are known to recruit new blood vessels to support their growth. Therefore, unique molecules expressed on tumor endothelial cells can function as targets for the antiangiogenic therapy of cancer. Current efforts are focusing on developing therapeutic agents capable of specifically targeting cancer cells and tumor-associated microenvironments including tumor blood vessels. These therapies hold the promise of high efficacy and low toxicity. One recognized strategy for improving the therapeutic effectiveness of conventional chemotherapeutics is to encapsulate anticancer drugs into targeting liposomes that bind to the cell surface receptors expressed on tumor-associated endothelial cells. These anti-angiogenic drug delivery systems could be used to target both tumor blood vessels as well as the tumor cells, themselves. This article reviews the mechanisms and advantages of various present and potential methods using peptide-conjugated liposomes to specifically destroy tumor blood vessels in anticancer therapy.","Wu, Han-Chung; Chang, De-Kuan",J Oncol,169,1

The current chemotherapy of the human trypanosomiases relies on only six drugs, five of which have been developed more than 30 years ago, have undesirable toxic side effects and most of them show drug-resistance. Though development of new anti-trypanosomal drugs seems to be a priority area research in this area has lagged far behind. The given review mainly focus upon the recent synthetic and computer based approaches made by various research groups for the development of newer anti-trypanosomal analogues which may have improved efficacy and oral bioavailability than the present ones. The given paper also attempts to investigate the relationship between the various physiochemical parameters and anti-trypanosomal activity that may be helpful in development of potent anti-trypanosomal agents against sleeping sickness.","Paliwal, Sarvesh K.; Verma, Ankita Narayan; Paliwal, Shailendra",Sci Pharm,169,17
723,723,723,ColorPhylo: A Color Code to Accurately Display Taxonomic Classifications,12.405417,6.1359596,2011-11-13,"Color may be very useful to visualise complex data. As far as taxonomy is concerned, color may help observing various species’ characteristics in correlation with classification. However, choosing the number of subclasses to display is often a complex task: on the one hand, assigning a limited number of colors to taxa of interest hides the structure imbedded in the subtrees of the taxonomy; on the other hand, differentiating a high number of taxa by giving them specific colors, without considering the underlying taxonomy, may lead to unreadable results since relationships between displayed taxa would not be supported by the color code. In the present paper, an automatic color coding scheme is proposed to visualise the levels of taxonomic relationships displayed as overlay on any kind of data plot. To achieve this goal, a dimensionality reduction method allows displaying taxonomic “distances” onto a Euclidean two-dimensional space. The resulting map is projected onto a 2D color space (the Hue, Saturation, Brightness colorimetric space with brightness set to 1). Proximity in the taxonomic classification corresponds to proximity on the map and is therefore materialised by color proximity. As a result, each species is related to a color code showing its position in the taxonomic tree. The so called ColorPhylo displays taxonomic relationships intuitively and can be combined with any biological result. A Matlab version of ColorPhylo is available at http://sy.lespi.free.fr/ColorPhylo-homepage.html. Meanwhile, an ad-hoc distance in case of taxonomy with unknown edge lengths is proposed.","Lespinats, Sylvain; Fertil, Bernard",Evol Bioinform Online,169,1
908,908,908,Host Modulators of H1N1 Cytopathogenicity,12.391107,5.743212,2012-08-02,"Influenza A virus infects 5–20% of the population annually, resulting in ∼35,000 deaths and significant morbidity. Current treatments include vaccines and drugs that target viral proteins. However, both of these approaches have limitations, as vaccines require yearly development and the rapid evolution of viral proteins gives rise to drug resistance. In consequence additional intervention strategies, that target host factors required for the viral life cycle, are under investigation. Here we employed arrayed whole-genome siRNA screening strategies to identify cell-autonomous molecular components that are subverted to support H1N1 influenza A virus infection of human bronchial epithelial cells. Integration across relevant public data sets exposed druggable gene products required for epithelial cell infection or required for viral proteins to deflect host cell suicide checkpoint activation. Pharmacological inhibition of representative targets, RGGT and CHEK1, resulted in significant protection against infection of human epithelial cells by the A/WS/33 virus. In addition, chemical inhibition of RGGT partially protected against H5N1 and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain. The observations reported here thus contribute to an expanding body of studies directed at decoding vulnerabilities in the command and control networks specified by influenza virulence factors.","Ward, Samuel E.; Kim, Hyun Seok; Komurov, Kakajan; Mendiratta, Saurabh; Tsai, Pei-Ling; Schmolke, Mirco; Satterly, Neal; Manicassamy, Balaji; Forst, Christian V.; Roth, Michael G.; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Blazewska, Katarzyna M.; McKenna, Charles E.; Fontoura, Beatriz M.; White, Michael A.",PLoS One,169,1

Gold-binding polypeptide (GBP) fused with single-chain antibody (ScFv) against HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), in forms of genetically engineered protein, was utilized. This GBP-ScFv fusion protein can directly bind onto the gold substrate with the strong binding affinity between the GBP and the gold surface, while the recognition site orients toward the sample for target binding at the same time. Furthermore, this one-step immobilization strategy greatly simplifies a fabrication process without any chemical modification as well as maintaining activity of biological recognition elements. This system allows specific immobilization of proteins and sensitive detection of targets, which were verified by surface plasmon resonance analysis and successfully applied to electrochemical cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy upto 0.14 ng/mL HBsAg.","Heo, Nam Su; Zheng, Shun; Yang, MinHo; Lee, Seok Jae; Lee, Sang Yup; Kim, Hwa-Jung; Park, Jung Youn; Lee, Chang-Soo; Park, Tae Jung",Sensors (Basel),169,1
1033,1033,1033,Hypoxia-regulated target genes implicated in tumor metastasis,12.307765,5.9101787,2012-12-14,"Hypoxia is an important microenvironmental factor that induces cancer metastasis. Hypoxia/hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) regulates many important steps of the metastatic processes, especially epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is one of the crucial mechanisms to cause early stage of tumor metastasis. To have a better understanding of the mechanism of hypoxia-regulated metastasis, various hypoxia/HIF-1α-regulated target genes are categorized into different classes including transcription factors, histone modifiers, enzymes, receptors, kinases, small GTPases, transporters, adhesion molecules, surface molecules, membrane proteins, and microRNAs. Different roles of these target genes are described with regards to their relationship to hypoxia-induced metastasis. We hope that this review will provide a framework for further exploration of hypoxia/HIF-1α-regulated target genes and a comprehensive view of the metastatic picture induced by hypoxia.","Tsai, Ya-Ping; Wu, Kou-Juey",J Biomed Sci,169,33
1056,1056,1056,Quantitative analysis of Glycyrrhizic acid from a polyherbal preparation using liquid chromatographic technique,12.371486,6.0319543,2012,"Glycyrrhizic acid has been used in Indian traditional medicine for ages. It is obtained from the root extract of Glycyrrhizaglabra. There is seasonal variation of Glycyrrhizic acid content in the roots of the plant. So a proper method for quantification of the same is necessary from the polyherbal preparation available in the market. A simple, rapid, sensitive and specific reverse phase high performance liquid chromatographic method have been developed for the quantitative estimation of glycyrrhizic acid from polyherbal preparation containing aqueous root extract of Glycyrrhizaglabra using a photodiode array detector. The identity confirmation was carried out using mass spectrometry. Baseline resolution of the glycyrrhizic acid peak was achieved on a reverse phase C18 column (125 mm × 4.0 mm, 5 μ) using an isocratic mobile phase consisting of 5.3 mM phosphate buffer and acetonitrile in the ratio 65:35 v/v. Chromatograms were monitored at 252 nm.5.3 mM phosphate buffer was replaced with 0.5mM ammonium acetate buffer in the mobile phase when MS detector was used. The method was found to be linear in the concentration range of 12.4 to124 μg/ml with a correlation co-efficient of 0.999. The limit of detection and the limit of quantitation were 3.08 μg/ml and 10.27 μg/ml respectively. The average recovery from three spike levels was 99.93 ± 0.26%. Identity confirmation of the chromatographic peak was achieved by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and similar molecular ion peak was obtained for both sample and standard. The developed method is suitable for the routine analysis, stability testing and assay of glycyrrhizic acid from polyherbal preparations containing aqueous extracts of Glycyrrhizaglabra.","De, Amit K.; Datta, Sriparna; Mukherjee, Arup",J Adv Pharm Technol Res,169,1
1182,1182,1182,Neutrophils Turn Plasma Proteins into Weapons against HIV-1,12.591265,5.7555447,2013-06-26,"As a consequence of innate immune activation granulocytes and macrophages produce hypochlorite/hypochlorous acid (HOCl) via secretion of myeloperoxidase (MPO) to the outside of the cells, where HOCl immediately reacts with proteins. Most proteins that become altered by this system do not belong to the invading microorganism but to the host. While there is no doubt that the myeloperoxidase system is capable of directly inactivating HIV-1, we hypothesized that it may have an additional indirect mode of action. We show in this article that HOCl is able to chemically alter proteins and thus turn them into Idea-Ps (Idea-P = immune defence-altered protein), potent amyloid-like and SH-groups capturing antiviral weapons against HIV-1. HOCl-altered plasma proteins (Idea-PP) have the capacity to bind efficiently and with high affinity to the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120, and to its receptor CD4 as well as to the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Idea-PP was able to inhibit viral infection and replication in a cell culture system as shown by reduced number of infected cells and of syncytia, resulting in reduction of viral capsid protein p24 in the culture supernatant. The unmodified plasma protein fraction had no effect. HOCl-altered isolated proteins antithrombin III and human serum albumin, taken as representative examples of the whole pool of plasma proteins, were both able to exert the same activity of binding to gp120 and inhibition of viral proliferation. These data offer an opportunity to improve the understanding of the intricacies of host-pathogen interactions and allow the generation of the following hypothetical scheme: natural immune defense mechanisms generate by posttranslational modification of plasma proteins a potent virucidal weapon that immobilizes the virus as well as inhibits viral fusion and thus entry into the host cells. Furthermore simulation of this mechanism in vitro might provide an interesting new therapeutic approach against microorganisms.","Speth, Cornelia; Brodde, Martin F.; Hagleitner, Magdalena; Rambach, Günter; Van Aken, Hugo; Dierich, Manfred; Kehrel, Beate E.",PLoS One,169,1

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) plays a very dominant role in controlling morphogenesis and cell differentiation in the model species Dictyostelium discoideum. As a secreted chemoattractant cAMP coordinates cell movement during aggregation and fruiting body morphogenesis. Secreted cAMP also controls gene expression at different developmental stages, while intracellular cAMP is extensively used to transduce the effect of other stimuli that control the developmental program. In this review, I present an overview of the different roles of cAMP in the model D. discoideum and I summarize studies aimed to resolve how these roles emerged during Dictyostelid evolution.","Schaap, Pauline",Dev Growth Differ,169,17

The present study evaluated the effects of genetic adjuvanting with Myd88 on the immune responses to a plasmid DNA rabies vaccine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasmids encoding rabies glycoprotein alone (pIRES-Rgp) or a fragment of Myd88 gene in addition (pIRES-Rgp-Myd) were constructed and administered intramuscularly or intrademally in Swiss albino mice (on days 0, 7, and 21). Rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) titres were estimated in the mice sera on days 14 and 28 by rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test. The protective efficacy of the constructs was evaluated by an intracerebral challenge with challenge virus standard virus on day 35. RESULTS: Co-expression of Myd88 increased RVNA responses to pIRES-Rgp by 3- and 2-folds, following intramuscular and intradermal immunization, respectively. pIRES-Rgp protected 80% of the mice following intramuscular and intradermal immunizations, while pIRES-Rgp-Myd afforded 100% protection following similar administrations. CONCLUSION: Genetic adjuvanting with Myd88 enhanced the RVNA responses and protective efficacy of a plasmid DNA rabies vaccine. This strategy might be useful for rabies vaccination of canines in the field, and needs further evaluation.","Ullas, Padinjaremattathil Thankappan; Desai, Anita; Madhusudana, Shampur Narayan",Clin Exp Vaccine Res,169,1

The second strategy is antigen incorporation into the viral capsid proteins. To extend this methodology, we have searched for new sites at the human adenovirus serotype 5 major capsid protein hexon for a vaccine antigen insertion. To this end, we utilized sites in the hexon hypervariable region (HVR) 7, 8 and 9 to display a 15-mer peptide containing the main neutralizing epitope of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. However, we could not rescue the viruses with the insertions of the peptide into HVR 8 and 9, consistent with the viruses being unable to tolerate insertions at these sites. In contrast, the virus with the insertion of the peptide in HVR 7 was viable - growing well in cell culture and the inserted peptide was exposed on the virion surface.","Hansra, Satyender; Pujhari, Sujit; Zakhartchouk, Alexander N",Open Virol J,169,1

This review will focus on the unique properties of the filamentous bacteriophage and highlight its diverse applications in current research. Particular emphases are placed on: (i) the advantages of the phage as a vaccine carrier, including its high immunogenicity, relative antigenic simplicity and ability to activate a range of immune responses, (ii) the phage’s potential as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent for infectious and chronic diseases, (iii) the regularity of the virion major coat protein lattice, which enables a variety of bioconjugation and surface chemistry applications, particularly in nanomaterials, and (iv) the phage’s large population sizes and fast generation times, which make it an excellent model system for directed protein evolution.

Therefore, squalene biosynthesis genes FARNESYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE (FPS) and SQUALENE SYNTHASE (SQS) were engineered via the Nicotiana tabacum chloroplast (C), nuclear (N) or both (CN) genomes to promote squalene biosynthesis. SQS levels were ~4300‐fold higher in C and CN lines than in N, but all accumulated ~150‐fold higher squalene due to substrate or storage limitations. Abnormal leaf and flower phenotypes, including lower pollen production and reduced fertility, were observed regardless of the compartment or level of transgene expression. Substantial changes in metabolomes of all lines were observed: levels of 65–120 unrelated metabolites, including the toxic alkaloid nicotine, changed by as much as 32‐fold. Profound effects of transgenesis on nontarget gene expression included changes in the abundance of 19 076 transcripts by up to 2000‐fold in CN; 7784 transcripts by up to 1400‐fold in N; and 5224 transcripts by as much as 2200‐fold in C. Transporter‐related transcripts were induced, and cell cycle‐associated transcripts were disproportionally repressed in all three lines. Transcriptome changes were validated by qRT‐PCR. The mechanism underlying these large changes likely involves metabolite‐mediated anterograde and/or retrograde signalling irrespective of the level of transgene expression or end product, due to imbalance of metabolic pools, offering new insight into both anticipated and unanticipated consequences of metabolic engineering.","Pasoreck, Elise K.; Su, Jin; Silverman, Ian M.; Gosai, Sager J.; Gregory, Brian D.; Yuan, Joshua S.; Daniell, Henry",Plant Biotechnol J,169,1

We screened five herbal medicines that have different pharmacological effects and combined them into a prescription according to the traditional Chinese medicine compatibility principle. The drug potential and protective efficacy were evaluated through a mouse model by determining the survival time, the parasite load in blood and tissues, the change of cell proportions in blood and histological detection. The results showed that the survival time of mice in the 500 mg Chinese herbs group and sulfadiazine group was significantly longer than that of the PBS control group. Also the parasite load in blood and tissues of 500 mg Chinese herbs and sulfadiazine groups was significantly lower than that of PBS group at 7 days post infection (dpi), which was in accordance with the result of histological detection. Monocyte and neutrophil of infected mice were remarkably increased while lymphocyte was dramatically decreased compared to that of blank group at 7 dpi.

AD is characterized by the pathological accumulation of abnormal tau (a microtubule-associated protein), and the mislocalization of tau from the axon to the somatodendritic compartment is thought to play an important role in disease pathogenesis. The axon initial segment (AIS) is thought to play a role in the selective localization of tau in the axonal compartment. Thus, disruption in the AIS barrier may allow tau to diffuse freely back into the somatodendritic compartment and potentially lead to neurotoxicity. Here, we analyzed AISs using stereological methods and protein immunoblotting, and the localization of tau was assessed with immunofluorescence optical density measurements and protein immunoblotting. None of the outcome measurements assessed, including AIS structure, AIS protein levels, the distribution of tau in neurons of the hippocampus (HP), and total tau or phospho-tau protein levels were different in young, middle-, and old-age Fischer 344 rats. The outcome measurements assessed, including AIS structure, AIS protein levels, the distribution of tau in neurons of the HP, and total tau or phospho-tau protein levels were not different in young, middle-, and old-age Fischer 344 rats, with the exception of a small reduction in AIS volume and diameter in the CA2 region of aged animals. These data suggest that aging largely has no effect on these properties of the AIS or tau distribution, and thus, may not contribute directly to tau mislocalization.","Kneynsberg, Andrew; Kanaan, Nicholas M.",eNeuro,169,1

We create a geometric analysis method (called GenomeLandscaper) to conduct landscape analysis of genome-fingerprints maps (GFM), trace large-scale repetitive regions, and assess their impacts on the global architectures of assembled chromosomes.

We construct a galaxy of genome-fingerprints maps (GGFM) for them, and a landscape compatibility among relatives is observed.

Surprisingly, we find that avirulent type III parasites are preferentially cleared in naive macrophages, independent of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) activation. The ability of naive macrophages to clear type III parasites was dependent on enhanced activity of NADPH oxidase (Nox)-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induction of guanylate binding protein 5 (Gbp5). Macrophages infected with type III parasites (CTG strain) showed a time-dependent increase in intracellular ROS generation that was higher than that induced by type I parasites (GT1 strain). The absence of Nox1 or Nox2, gp91 subunit isoforms of the Nox complex, reversed ROS-mediated clearance of CTG parasites. Consistent with this finding, both Nox1(−/−) and Nox2(−/−) mice showed higher susceptibility to CTG infection than wild-type mice. Additionally, Gbp5 expression was induced upon infection and the enhanced clearance of CTG strain parasites was reversed in Gbp5(−/−) macrophages. Expression of a type I ROP18 allele in CTG prevented clearance in naive macrophages, suggesting that it plays a role counteracting Gbp5. Although ROS and Gbp5 have been linked to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, clearance of CTG parasites did not rely on induction of pyroptosis. Collectively, these findings reveal that not all strains of T. gondii are adept at avoiding clearance in macrophages and define new roles for ROS and Gbps in controlling this important intracellular pathogen.","Matta, Sumit K.; Patten, Kelley; Wang, Quiling; Kim, Bae-Hoon; MacMicking, John D.; Sibley, L.

Ease of transmission has allowed the virus to spread worldwide with varying degrees of virulence depending upon the virus strain and host species. The emergence of new virulent genotypes from global epizootics, and the year-to-year genomic changes in low and high virulence APMV-1 imply that distinct genotypes of APMV-1 are simultaneously evolving at different geographic locations across the globe. This vast genomic diversity may be favoured by large variety of avian species susceptibility to APMV-1 infection, and by the availability of highly mobile wild birds. It has long been considered that waterfowls are not sensitive to APMV-1 and are unable to show any clinical signs, however, outbreaks from the 90′s contradict these concepts. The APMV-1 isolates are increasingly reported from the waterfowl. Waterfowl have strong innate immune responses, which minimize the impact of virus infection, however, are unable to prevent the viral shedding. Numerous APMV-1 are carried by domestic waterfowl intermingling with terrestrial poultry. Therefore, commercial ducks and geese should be vaccinated against APMV-1 to minimize the virus shedding and for the prevention the transmission. Genetic diversity within APMV-1 demonstrates the need for continual monitoring of viral evolution and periodic updates of vaccine seed-strains to achieve efficient control and eradication of APMV-1 in waterfowls.

A recent interest has grown to create antimicrobial copper touch surfaces, in order to counteract microbial spread in the healthcare environment. For the first time, five French long-term care facilities were at 50% fitted with copper alloys door handles and handrails. Related to the environmental bacterial contamination, 1400 samples were carried out on copper and control surfaces over three years after copper installation. In addition, some copper door handles were taken from the different facilities, and their specific activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was tested in vitro. In comparison to control surfaces, copper door handles and handrails revealed significantly lower contamination levels. This difference was observed in the five long-term care facilities and it persists through the three years of the study. High and extreme levels of bacterial contamination were less frequent on copper surfaces. Although, the antibacterial activity of copper surfaces against MRSA was lowered after three years of regular use, it was still significant as compared to inert control surfaces. Therefore, copper containing surfaces are promising actors in the non-spreading of environmental bacterial contamination in healthcare facilities.","Colin, Marius; Klingelschmitt, Flora; Charpentier, Emilie; Josse, Jérôme; Kanagaratnam, Lukshe; De Champs, Christophe; Gangloff, Sophie C.",Materials (Basel),169,1

However, it is unclear whether OAS proteins have a role in regulating gene expression. Here, we show that OAS1 and OAS3 act as negative regulators of the expression of chemokines and interferon-responsive genes in human macrophages. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) technology was used to engineer human myeloid cell lines in which the OAS1 or OAS3 gene was deleted. Neither OAS1 nor OAS3 was exclusively responsible for the degradation of rRNA in macrophages stimulated with poly(I:C), a synthetic surrogate for viral double-stranded (ds)RNA. An mRNA sequencing analysis revealed that genes related to type I interferon signaling and chemokine activity were increased in OAS1(−/−) and OAS3(−/−) macrophages treated with intracellular poly(I:C). Indeed, retinoic-acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I- and interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein (IFIH1 or MDA5)-mediated induction of chemokines and interferon-stimulated genes was regulated by OAS3, but Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and TLR4-mediated induction of those genes was modulated by OAS1 in macrophages. However, stimulation of these cells with type I interferons had no effect on OAS1- or OAS3-mediated chemokine secretion. These data suggest that OAS1 and OAS3 negatively regulate the expression of chemokines and interferon-responsive genes in human macrophages.","Lee, Wook-Bin; Choi, Won Young; Lee, Dong-Hyun; Shim, Hyeran; Kim-Ha, Jeongsil; Kim, Young-Joon",BMB Rep,169,11

Viral Ebola and influenza genome data are being used for real-time tracking, while food-borne bacterial pathogen outbreaks and hospital outbreaks are investigated using whole genomes in the UK, Canada, the USA and the other countries. Also, plant pathogen genomes are starting to be used to investigate plant disease epidemics such as the wheat blast outbreak in Bangladesh. While these genome-based approaches provide never-seen advantages over all previous approaches with regard to public health and biosecurity, they also come with new vulnerabilities and risks with regard to cybersecurity. The more we rely on genome databases, the more likely these databases will become targets for cyber-attacks to interfere with public health and biosecurity systems by compromising their integrity, taking them hostage, or manipulating the data they contain. Also, while there is the potential to collect pathogen genomic data from infected individuals or agricultural and food products during disease outbreaks to improve disease modeling and forecast, how to protect the privacy of individuals, growers, and retailers is another major cyberbiosecurity challenge. As data become linkable to other data sources, individuals and groups become identifiable and potential malicious activities targeting those identified become feasible. Here, we define a number of potential cybersecurity weaknesses in today's pathogen genome databases to raise awareness, and we provide potential solutions to strengthen cyberbiosecurity during the development of the next generation of pathogen genome databases.","Vinatzer, Boris A.; Heath, Lenwood S.; Almohri, Hussain M.

Here, we describe our participation in a weekly prospective ILI forecasting challenge for the United States for the 2016-17 season and subsequent evaluation of our performance. We implemented a metapopulation model framework with 32 model variants. Variants differed from each other in their assumptions about: the force-of-infection (FOI); use of uninformative priors; the use of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and the treatment of regions as either independent or coupled. Individual model variants were chosen subjectively as the basis for our weekly forecasts; however, a subset of coupled models were only available part way through the season. Most frequently, during the 2016-17 season, we chose; FOI variants with both school vacations and humidity terms; uninformative priors; the inclusion of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and coupled regions (when available). Our near-term weekly forecasts substantially over-estimated incidence early in the season when coupled models were not available. However, our forecast accuracy improved in absolute terms and relative to other teams once coupled solutions were available. In retrospective analysis, we found that the 2016-17 season was not typical: on average, coupled models performed better when fit without historically augmented data. Also, we tested a simple ensemble model for the 2016-17 season and found that it underperformed our subjective choice for all forecast targets. In this study, we were able to improve accuracy during a prospective forecasting exercise by coupling dynamics between regions. Although reduction of forecast subjectivity should be a long-term goal, some degree of human intervention is likely to improve forecast accuracy in the medium-term in parallel with the systematic consideration of more sophisticated ensemble approaches.","Ben-Nun, Michal; Riley, Pete; Turtle, James; Bacon, David P.; Riley, Steven",PLoS Comput Biol,169,1

Despite intense research, targeted sepsis therapies beyond antibiotics have remained elusive. The cornerstone of sepsis research is the development of animal models to mimic human bacterial infections and test novel pharmacologic targets. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) have served as an attractive, but expensive, animal to model human bacterial infections due to their nearly identical cardiopulmonary anatomy and physiology, as well as host response to infection. Several NHP species have provided substantial insight into sepsis-mediated inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, acute lung injury, and multi-organ failure. The use of NHPs has usually focused on translating therapies from early preclinical models to human clinical trials. However, despite successful sepsis interventions in NHP models, there are still no FDA-approved sepsis therapies.

In addition, we investigated photo-induced cytotoxicity of the synthesized CDs in a wide concentration range under white light. RESULTS: Our results suggest little cytotoxicity of the CDs after 24 h exposure of cells. Only the high quantum yield CDs caused a significant toxicity to cells at the highest concentrations of 2.0 and 1.5 mg/ml compared to other CDs at similar concentrations. The synthesized CDs entered the cells without any significant cytotoxicity. The CDs also caused a concentration- and irradiation time-dependent photo-induced cytotoxicity.

Vaccination is an effective disease prevention and control method, but limitations remain for protecting against catastrophic mortality of fish infected with different strains of streptococci. Immunoproteomics analysis of S. agalactiae was used to identify antigenic proteins and construct a chimeric multiepitope vaccine. Epitopes from five antigenic proteins were shuffled in five helices of a flavodoxin backbone, and in silico analysis predicted a suitable RNA and protein structure for protein expression. 45F2 and 42E2 were identified as the best candidates for a chimeric multiepitope vaccine. Recombinant plasmids were constructed to produce a recombinant protein vaccine and DNA vaccine system. Overexpressed proteins were determined to be 30 kDa and 25 kDa in the E. coli and TK1 systems, respectively. The efficacy of the chimeric multiepitope construct as a recombinant protein vaccine and DNA vaccine was evaluated in Nile tilapia, followed by S. agalactiae challenge at 1 × 10(7) CFU/mL.

When tidal volume (V(T)) is kept constant, ΔP may change according to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)-induced changes in lung aeration. ΔP may decrease if PEEP leads to a recruitment of collapsed lung tissue but will increase if PEEP mainly causes pulmonary overdistension. This study tests the hypothesis that individualized high PEEP, when compared to fixed low PEEP, protects against PPC in patients undergoing open abdominal surgery. METHODS: The “Driving prESsure durIng GeNeral AnesThesIa for Open abdomiNal surgery trial” (DESIGNATION) is an international, multicenter, two-group, double-blind randomized clinical superiority trial. A total of 1468 patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two intraoperative ventilation strategies. Investigators screen patients aged ≥ 18 years and with a body mass index ≤ 40 kg/m(2), scheduled for open abdominal surgery and at risk for PPC. Patients either receive an intraoperative ventilation strategy with individualized high PEEP with recruitment maneuvers (RM) (“individualized high PEEP”) or one in which PEEP of 5 cm H(2)O without RM is used (“low PEEP”). In the “individualized high PEEP” group, PEEP is set at the level at which ΔP is lowest. In both groups of the trial, V(T) is kept at 8 mL/kg predicted body weight. The primary endpoint is the occurrence of PPC, recorded as a collapsed composite of adverse pulmonary events. DISCUSSION: DESIGNATION will be the first randomized clinical trial that is adequately powered to compare the effects of individualized high PEEP with RM versus fixed low PEEP without RM on the occurrence of PPC after open abdominal surgery. The results of DESIGNATION will support anesthesiologists in their decisions regarding PEEP settings during open abdominal surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03884543.

A substantial proportion occurs intrapartum and is avoidable with better care. At a low-resource tertiary hospital, this study assessed the quality of intrapartum care and adherence to locally-tailored clinical guidelines. METHODS: A non-participatory, structured, direct observation study was held at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, Zanzibar, Tanzania, between October and November 2016. Women in active labour were followed and structure, processes of labour care and outcomes of care systematically recorded. Descriptive analyses were performed on the labour observations and compared to local guidelines and supplemented by qualitative findings. A Poisson regression analysis assessed factors affecting foetal heart rate monitoring (FHRM) guidelines adherence. RESULTS: 161 labouring women were observed. The nurse/midwife-to-labouring-women ratio of 1:4, resulted in doctors providing a significant part of intrapartum monitoring. Care during labour and two-thirds of deliveries was provided in a one-room labour ward with shared beds. Screening for privacy and communication of examination findings were done in 50 and 34%, respectively. For the majority, there was delayed recognition of labour progress and insufficient support in second stage of labour. While FHRM was generally performed suboptimally with a median interval of 105 (interquartile range 57–160) minutes, occurrence of an intrapartum risk event (non-reassuring FHR, oxytocin use or poor progress) increased assessment frequency significantly (rate ratio 1.32 (CI 1.09–1.58)). CONCLUSIONS: Neither international nor locally-adapted standards of intrapartum routine care were optimally achieved. This was most likely due to a grossly inadequate capacity of birth attendants; without whom innovative interventions at birth are unlikely to succeed. This calls for international and local stakeholders to address the root causes of unsafe intrafacility care in low-resource settings, including the number of skilled birth attendants required for safe and respectful births.","Housseine, Natasha; Punt, Marieke C.; Mohamed, Ali Gharib; Said, Said Mzee; Maaløe, Nanna; Zuithoff, Nicolaas P.

The recent human infections with H7N9 virus, totalling over 130 cases with 39 fatalities to date, have been characterized by severe pulmonary disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)(2). This is concerning because H7 viruses have typically been associated with ocular disease in humans, rather than severe respiratory disease(3). This recent outbreak underscores the need to better understand the pathogenesis and transmission of these viruses in mammals. Here we assess the ability of A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) viruses, isolated from fatal human cases, to cause disease in mice and ferrets and to transmit to naive animals. Both H7N9 viruses replicated to higher titre in human airway epithelial cells and in the respiratory tract of ferrets compared to a seasonal H3N2 virus. Moreover, the H7N9 viruses showed greater infectivity and lethality in mice compared to genetically related H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H7N9 viruses were readily transmitted to naive ferrets through direct contact but, unlike the seasonal H3N2 virus, did not transmit readily by respiratory droplets. The lack of efficient respiratory droplet transmission was corroborated by low receptor-binding specificity for human-like α2,6-linked sialosides. Our results indicate that H7N9 viruses have the capacity for efficient replication in mammals and human airway cells and highlight the need for continued public health surveillance of this emerging virus.

In this context the estimated use of the patient’s physiologic tolerance to anemia enables 1) the tolerance of larger blood losses (loss of “diluted blood”), 2) the onset of transfusion to the time after surgical control of bleeding to be delayed and 3) the perioperative collection of autologous red blood cells. The present review article summarizes the mechanisms, influencing factors and limits of this natural tolerance to anemia and deduces the indication for perioperative red blood cell transfusion. Under strictly controlled conditions (anesthesia, normovolemia, complete muscular relaxation, hyperoxemia, mild hypothermia) extremely low hemoglobin concentrations [Hb <3 g/dl (<1.86 mmol/l)] are tolerated without transfusion by individuals with no cardiopulmonary disease. In the clinical routine these situations are limited to borderline situations e.g. unexpected massive blood losses in Jehovah’s Witnesses or unexpected shortcomings in blood supply. The current recommendations coincide to the effect that perioperative red blood cell transfusion 1) is unnecessary up to a Hb concentration of 10 g/dl (6.21 mmol/l) even in older patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidity and 2) is only recommended in cases of Hb <6 g/dl (<3.72 mmol/l) in otherwise healthy subjects including pregnant women and children. Critically ill patients with multiple trauma and sepsis do not seem to benefit from transfusions up to Hb concentrations >9 g/dl (>5.59 mmol/l). In cases of massive hemorrhaging and diffuse bleeding disorders the maintenance of a Hb concentration of 10 g/dl (6.21 mmol/l) seems to contribute to stabilization of coagulation.","Habler, O.; Meier, J.; Pape, A.; Kertscho, H.; Zwißler, B.",Anaesthesist,169,22

We relate the main features concerning patients that were admitted during years 2009 and 2010 in our intensive care unit with an A(H1N1)v2009 infection, mainly for acute respiratory distress. Demographic, clinical, and biological data as well as given medications and outcome were prospectively collected among all PCR-confirmed influenza-infected patients. In 2009 and 2010, 25 patients met the criteria. Patients’ median age was 40.4 (±17.4) years. Most of them (22/25) had comorbidities such as: chronic diseases, overweight, obesity, pregnancy, and Down syndrome. Maximum bed-occupation rate was 10 days per million inhabitants. Main diagnosis for ICU admission was virus-related pneumonia. Twenty-two out of 25 patients needed mechanical ventilation, some required rescue therapies such as extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) or hi-frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV), both only available in few French hospitals. Within the study period, 12 patients died (48%) mainly of multi-organ failure. Through 2009 and 2010 autumn and winter periods, for several weeks, the A(H1N1)v2009 virus infection resulted in a significant increase of workload in Réunion Island ICUs. In 2010, the failure of the mass immunization campaign, particularly among the at-risk groups, led to severe cases of A(H1N1)v2009 infections, particularly among patients with comorbidities. Our data may contribute toward better management of influenza virus pandemics in the future.","Gaüzère, B. -A.; Bussienne, F.; Bouchet, B.; Jabot, J.; Roussiaux, A.; Drouet, D.; Djourhi, S.; Leauté, B.; Belcour, D.; Bossard, G.; Champion, S.; Jaffar-Bandjee, M. -C.; Belmonte, O.; Vilain, P.; Brottet, E.; Hoang, L.; Vandroux, D.",Bull Soc Pathol Exot,169,1

The previously established, but distant, antigenic relationship between these viruses was strengthened by genetic findings (presence of cognate genes, amino acid identity between 55 and 88%, similar conserved terminal motifs, suspected read-through phenomenon in segment 9 of both viruses) and by indistinguishable ultramicroscopic morphologies. Moreover, putative constitutive modifying enzyme activities were suspected to be carried out by homologous viral proteins (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, methyl/guanylyl transferase, NTPase). These findings, together with the comparative analysis to genomes of south-east Asian isolates, support the recent classification of arboviruses with 12 segments of dsRNA within two distinct genera (genus Coltivirus and genus Seadornavirus) and raise interesting questions about the evolutionary origins of coltiviruses. The previously proposed hypothesis that EYA virus was derived from an ancestral virus introduced in Europe with the migration of lagomorphs from North-America, would imply a divergence date between American and European isolates of over 50 million years ago (MYA). This analysis allows for the first time to propose an evolutionary rate for virus dsRNA genomes which was found to be in the order of 10(−8) to 10(−9) mutations/nt/year, a rate similar to that of dsDNA genomes.","Attoui, H.; Mohd Jaafar, F.; Biagini, P.; Cantaloube, J.-F.; de Micco, P.; Murphy, F.

In sepsis and other pathological conditions, bacterial lipopolysaccharide endotoxin can induce alveolar macrophages (AM) to release proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6. Studying the mechanisms that control alveolar macrophage cytokine production may lead to better therapies for conditions involving inflammatory lung injury. We and others have noted significant differences between alveolar macrophages and peritoneal macrophages, but large numbers of human or murine alveolar macrophages are rarely available for detailed mechanistic studies. We have obtained three murine alveolar macrophage cell lines (AMJ2C8, AMJ2C11, and AMJ2C20) and have begun to characterize their cytokine responses to proinflammatory stimuli. We measured the effects of endotoxin, interferon gamma, and the combination of the two on production of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-6 in each line. We also studied the expression of the endotoxin receptor CD14 by these cells, and investigated the effect of serum on their endotoxin responsiveness. We show here that all three of the cell lines responded in a manner comparable to that of primary murine alveolar macrophages. Observed variations between these lines may reflect the documented heterogeneity seen in populations of primary alveolar macrophages. These cell lines should expand the repertoire of tools available to investigators studying regulation of murine alveolar macrophage responses.","Ryan, Lisa K.; Golenbock, Douglas T.; Wu, Jiayi; Vermeulen, Mary W.",In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,169,17

While terrorist acts are the most insidious and onerous of all disruptions, it is obvious that there are many similarities to the way one should deal with these willful acts and those caused by natural and accidental incidents that have also resulted in adverse and severe consequences. However, there is one major and critical difference between terrorist acts and the other types of disruptions: the terrorist acts are willful — and therefore also adaptive, if not coordinated. One must counter these acts with the same, if not more sophisticated, willful, adaptive and informed approach. Real-time, information-based decision making — which Tien (2003) has called the decision informatics paradigm — is the approach advanced herein to help make the right decisions at the various stages of a disruption. It is focused on decisions and based on multiple data sources, data fusion and analysis methods, timely information, stochastic decision models and a systems engineering outlook; moreover, it is multidisciplinary, evolutionary and systemic in practice. The approach provides a consistent way to address real-time emergency issues, including those concerned with the preparation for a major disruption, the prediction of such a disruption, the prevention or mitigation of the disruption, the detection of the disruption, the response to the disruption, and the recovery steps that are necessary to adequately, if not fully, recuperate from the disruption.

Despite a gradual increase of SFTS cases and high mortality in endemic regions, no specific viral therapy nor vaccine is available. Here, we developed a single recombinant plasmid DNA encoding SFTSV genes, Gn and Gc together with NP-NS fusion antigen, as a vaccine candidate. The viral antigens were fused with Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (Flt3L) and IL-12 gene was incorporated into the plasmid to enhance cell-mediated immunity. Vaccination with the DNA provides complete protection of IFNAR KO mice upon lethal SFTSV challenge, whereas immunization with a plasmid without IL-12 gene resulted in partial protection. Since we failed to detect antibodies against surface glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, in the immunized mice, antigen-specific cellular immunity, as confirmed by enhanced antigen-specific T cell responses, might play major role in protection. Finally, we evaluated the degree of protective immunity provided by protein immunization of the individual glycoprotein, Gn or Gc. Although both protein antigens induced a significant level of neutralizing activity against SFTSV, Gn vaccination resulted in relatively higher neutralizing activity and better protection than Gc vaccination. However, both antigens failed to provide complete protection. Given that DNA vaccines have failed to induce sufficient immunogenicity in human trials when compared to protein vaccines, optimal combinations of DNA and protein elements, proper selection of target antigens, and incorporation of efficient adjuvant, need to be further investigated for SFTSV vaccine development.","Kang, Jun-Gu; Jeon, Kyeongseok; Choi, Hooncheol; Kim, Yuri; Kim, Hong-Il; Ro, Hyo-Jin; Seo, Yong Bok; Shin, Jua; Chung, Junho; Jeon, Yoon Kyung; Kim, Yang Soo; Lee, Keun Hwa; Cho, Nam-Hyuk",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,169,1

As most of respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses and antibiotic therapy is rarely indicated. Reasons for the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics in this patient population are false expectations regarding the course and duration of common cold symptoms and especially coughing. After exclusion of severe diseases acute coughing should be treated with a symptom-oriented therapy. There is no reliable data on the use of antibiotic therapy in patient groups with an increased risk for severe complications. Studies on the use of laboratory makers to identify persons with bacterial infections who might benefit from antibiotic therapy and to reduce unnecessary prescriptions have been negative for CRP and inconclusive for procalcitonin. Peer-review and delayed prescribing could be demonstrated to reduce the rate of unneeded antibiotic prescriptions. Most of the symptomatic therapies employed for cough and the common cold are not studied in methodologically sound randomized controlled trials. The most common expectorants used in Germany are Ambroxol and N-Acetylcytein. For both substances there is little data supporting a benefit in patients with an acute bronchitis.

Although the ideal concept would be the replacement of the abnormal gene by a copy of the functional gene, currently there have not been reliable and safe techniques to allow the site-specific integration of DNA into the human genome (2). Thus, almost all gene therapies are developed by simply transferring the therapeutic gene into somatic cells without replacing the abnormal gene. The goal is to identify and correct genetic abnormalities interfering with the cell cycle and to correct them in all cells. Technically, there are two methods amenable for gene transfer: reintroduction of in vitro transferred gene into the body and direct transfer of gene into the target cells in vivo.","Jiao, Long R.; Havlik, Roman; Nicholls, Joanna; Jensen, Steen Lindkaer; Habib, Nagy A.",Suicide Gene Therapy,169,1

Eight species of Eimeria, and Isospora suis, were recovered. In their descending order of predominance in the pigs raised on concrete, the species of coccidia were E. debliecki (26.7%), E. scabra (22.4%), E. neodebliecki (19.8%), E. porci (15.5%), E. suis (11.6%), E. polita (8.6%), E. perminuta (7%), E. spinosa (5.6%) and E. suis (3.9%).

I. suis oocysts prevailed in 8.3% of the 36 sows on concrete, and in 11.1% (327) of those which were positive for coccidia. Isosporoid oocysts were absent in the village sows. Of the 125 <24-day-old piglets, 29.6% were diarrhoeic, and of these, 43.2% were positive for coccidia. Four of the 16 (25%) coccidia-positive, diarrhoeic piglets, and four of the 37 (10.8%) coccidia-positive non-diarrhoeic piglets shed I. suis oocysts, an observation which seems to weaken the present contention that I. suis is the primary causative agent of neonatal porcine occidiosis. The highest mean number of oocysts per gram faeces (23 550) was recorded from the diarrhoeic farm piglets on conrete, and the lowest of 6,100 from the gestating farm sows.

The production of nitric oxide (NO) in the nervous system is catalyzed by three, highly homologous isoforms of NO synthase (NOS). NOS-2, the dimeric, heme-containing, soluble protein whose activity is independent of a rise in intracellular calcium, is variously termed ‘inducible,’ ‘immunologic,’ and ‘macrophage NOS (macNOS).’ Nitric oxide inhibits not only NOS-2 activity but also regulates the level of NOS-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression through a mechanism involving NF-(K) B. There is specific evidence for the glial expression of NOS-2 associated with neuronal injury and infection of the CNS and in neurodegenerative and demyelinating diseases. Direct injury in the CNS results in a reactive gliosis, characterized by the induction of the glial fibrillary acidic protein gene and changes in astrocyte morphology.","Loihl, Angela K.; Murphy, Sean",Prog Brain Res,169,1

Their quality is important for species distribution. The role of cave microclimate as well as other environmental factors influencing the distribution of cave‐dwelling species, is poorly known. We tested the significance of cave variables (length, temperature, elevation, occurrence of water) and geographical location for the presence of bats during hibernation and the breeding season in five regions in Romania. To detect species' environmental relationships, we used canonical correspondence analyses for winter bat aggregations and principal components analysis for maternity colonies. We analysed the factors influencing the distribution of bats by using two sets of explanatory variables reflecting cave characteristics and geographical locations. Winter aggregation was divided into three groups: (1) bat species that prefer high temperatures (Rhinolophus euryale, Myotis cappacinii) and hibernate at a low altitude; (2) species ranging from mid‐ to high elevation and low temperature (Myotis myotis/oxygnathus group); (3) species that hibernate in large, cold cave systems with a constant flow of the water (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Nyctalus noctula, Barbastella barbastellus). Maternity colonies were divided into those that select either high (rhinolophids) or low temperatures (My. myotis/oxygnathus and Miniopterus schreibersii). The most important factors influencing the distribution of bats are the temperature in caves and their geographical location. This information was combined with IUCN's Red List data as well as with the number of individuals occurring in caves with the aim of identifying the key sites for conservation. The majority of these sites, which also constitute the refuges for vulnerable species, are located in west and south‐western Romania.

Although β2 adrenergic receptor agonists are commonly used to relax airway smooth muscle for treating AHR, there are side effects such as desensitization of long-term use. Therefore, it is desirable to develop alternative relaxant for airway smooth muscle, preferably based on natural products. One potential candidate is the inexpensive and widely available natural herb saponins of Dioscorea nipponicae (SDN), which has recently been reported to suppress the level of inflammatory factor IL-17A in ovalbumin-induced mice, thereby alleviating the inflammation symptoms of asthma. Here, we evaluated the biomechanical effect of SDN on IL-17A-mediated changes of cultured human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) in vitro. The stiffness and traction force of the cells were measured by optical magnetic twisting cytometry (OMTC), and Fourier transform traction microscopy (FTTM), respectively. The cell proliferation was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetry, the cell migration was measured by cell scratch test, and the changes of cell cytoskeleton were assessed by laser confocal microscopy. We found that the stiffness and traction force of HASMCs were enhanced along with the increases of IL-17A concentration and exposure time, and SDN treatment dose-dependently reduced these IL-17A-induced changes in cell mechanical properties. Furthermore, SDN alleviated IL-17A-mediated effects on HASMCs proliferation, migration, and cytoskeleton remodeling. These results demonstrate that SDN could potentially be a novel drug candidate as bronchodilator for treating asthma-associated AHR.","Wang, Yue; Zhang, Yifan; Zhang, Ming; Li, Jingjing; Pan, Yan; Liu, Lei; Deng, Linhong",J Eng Sci Med Diagn Ther,169,22

The utilized structured tree is used to represent the nonimageable vessels beyond the 3D domain. The coupling of the two different scales (1D and 3D) employs a Dirichlet–Neumann approach. The simulations are performed under a variety of conditions such as light breathing and constant flow ventilation (which is characterized by very rapid acceleration and deceleration). All results show that the peripheral vessels significantly impact the pressure, however, the flow is relatively unaffected, reinforcing the fact that the majority of the lung impedance is due to the lower generations rather than the peripheral vessels. Furthermore, simulations of a hypothetical diseased lung (restricted flow in the superior left lobe) under mechanical ventilation show that the mean pressure at the outlets of the 3D domain is about 28% higher. This hypothetical model illustrates potential causes of volutrauma in the human lung and furthermore demonstrates how different clinical scenarios can be studied without the need to assume the unknown flow distribution into the downstream region.","Comerford, Andrew; Förster, Christiane; Wall, Wolfgang A.",J Biomech Eng,169,22

Location The Czech Republic. Methods Plant species richness in 302 nature reserves was studied by using 14 explanatory variables reflecting the reserve area, altitude, climate, habitat diversity and prevailing vegetation type. Backward elimination of explanatory variables was used to analyse the data, taking into account their interactive nature, until the model contained only significant terms. Results A minimal adequate model with reserve area, mean altitude, prevailing vegetation type and habitat diversity (expressed as the number of major habitat types in the reserve) accounted for 53.9% of the variance in species number. After removing the area effect, habitat diversity explained 15.6% of variance, while prevailing vegetation type explained 29.6%. After removing the effect of both area and vegetation type, the resulting model explained 10.3% of the variance, indicating that species richness further increased with habitat diversity, and most obviously towards warm districts. After removing the effects of area, habitat diversity and climatic district, the model still explained 9.4% of the variance, and showed that species richness (i) significantly decreased with increasing mean altitude and annual precipitation, and with decreasing January temperature in the region of the mountain flora, and (ii) increased with altitudinal range in regions of temperate and thermophilous flora. Main conclusions We described, in quantitative terms, the effects of the main factors that might be considered to be determining plant species richness in temperate nature reserves, and evaluated their relative importance. The direct habitat effect on species richness was roughly equal to the direct area effect, but the total direct and indirect effects of area slightly exceeded that of habitat. It was shown that the overall effect of composite variables such as altitude or climatic district can be separated into particular climatic variables, which influence the richness of flora in a context‐specific manner.

We have constructed an M13 probe from the 5′ end of the genome of rhinovirus 14 (HRV‐14) and used this to detect directly viral RNA. Of the 56 human rhinoviruses so far investigated 54 or 96.4% gave clearly positive hybridization signals. However, the strength of this signal depended very much on the molecular relationship of these viruses. Thus, HRV‐3, 4, 17, 72, and, to a slightly lesser extent, HRV‐2, 6, 9, 13, 19, 31, 42, 49, 64, and 69 appear to be closely related to HRV‐14 whereas HRV‐5, 7, 8, 16, 32, 40, 45, 55, 56, 63, 80, 82, and 85 appear to be relatively divergent. Further, evidence is provided in this study that indicates that it would be feasible to use cDNA probes to detect human rhinoviruses in nasal washings. However, the sensitivity of detection was clearly affected by both the inclusion of inhibitors of endogenous RNase activity in the RNA extraction mixture and also in the method of extracting the viral RNA. From reconstruction experiments in nasal washings and under optimal conditions, we can detect virus at 10(2.8) TCID(50)/ml.","Ai‐Nakib, W.; Stanway, G.; Forsyth, M.; Hughes, P. J.; Almond, J.

DESIGN: Retrospective electronic medical record review of prospectively collected data from critically ill children receiving peramivir for influenza A or B viral infections in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). SETTING: A 189‐bed, freestanding children's tertiary care teaching hospital in Philadelphia, PA. PATIENTS: Critically ill children admitted to the PICU who were infected with influenza between January 1, 2016 and March 31, 2018. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Eleven patients, two females (18%) and nine males (82%), accounted for 24 peramivir samples for therapeutic drug management. The median age was 5 years (interquartile range 1.5–6.5 yrs) with a median weight of 16.4 kg (interquartile range 14–24 kg). Ten (91%) patients demonstrated a larger volume of distribution, 11 (100%) patients demonstrated an increase in clearance, and 11 (100%) patients demonstrated a shorter half‐life estimate as compared with the package insert and previous pediatric trial data for peramivir. Eight (73%) patients tested positive for a strain of influenza A and 3 (27%) patients tested positive for influenza B; 4 of 11 (36%) patients tested positive for multiple viruses. All patients had adjustments made to their dosing interval to a more frequent interval. Ten (91%) patients were adjusted to an every‐12‐hour regimen and 1 (9%) patient was adjusted to an every‐8‐hour regimen. No adverse events were associated with peramivir treatment. CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetics of PRV demonstrated in this PICU cohort differs in comparison to healthy pediatric and adult patients, and alterations to dosing regimens may be needed in PICU patients to achieve pharmacodynamic exposures. Additional investigations in the PICU population are needed to confirm these findings.","Cies, Jeffrey J.; Moore, Wayne S.; Enache, Adela; Chopra, Arun",Pharmacotherapy,169,1

Unlike the wild type JHM, these two mutant viruses grew more slowly with no prominent cell fusion. The buoyant densities of the mutants were slightly lower and 2c was revealed to have fewer peplomers than JHM by electron microscopy. The purified JHM contained five polypeptides with molecular weights (M.W.) of 260,000, 105,000 (GP105), 65,000, 60,000 (P60), and 23,000 (GP23). In addition to two polypeptides, P60 and GP23, which were common to JHM and the mutants, 1a was found to contain three other specific polypeptides with M.W. of 180,000 (GP160), 110,000, and 95,000 (GP95), while 2c had GP180, GP105, GP95, and one with a M.W. of 175,000. All of these polypeptides were shown to be glycosylated except for P60. After bromelain treatment, all these viruses lost the peplomers and contained P60 and another new 18,000 dalton polypeptide.","Makino, Shinji; Taguchi, Fumihiro; Hayami, Masanori; Fujiwara, Kosaku",Microbiol Immunol,169,1

Furthermore, natural disasters (e.g. heat waves, severe storms, floods and large forest fires) are becoming more frequent. The impact of global warming and climate change on health involves an increase in respiratory, cardiovascular, renal and cognitive mental diseases. Furthermore, a change in the frequency and patterns of infectious diseases can also be observed in Europe. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This article presents the most important studies that investigated diseases associated with the climate change, with special reference to those that represent a challenge for intensive care medicine. RESULTS: Currently available epidemiological data and statistical extrapolations indicate that diseases resulting from the climate change (acute infection-related respiratory and intestinal diseases, exacerbation of pre-existing pulmonary lesions, heat-related dehydration, cerebral insults and myocardial infarction) are relevant for intensive care medicine. Particular emphasis is placed on a significant increase in acute kidney damage during heat waves. A previously unknown pattern of infectious diseases necessitates new knowledge and targeted management. In some studies, persisting mental impairments were registered during heat waves and natural disasters, e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder. CONCLUSION: Intensive care medicine must be prepared for the challenges due to global warming and climate change. Slow but continuous changes (e.g. rise in temperature) as well as acute changes (e.g. heat waves and natural disasters) will induce an increased need for intensive medical care services (e.g. an increase in the need for renal replacement procedures). Intensive care physicians will need to be familiar with the diagnostics and management of diseases associated with the climate change. An initiative of the specialist societies involved would be welcomed.","Bein, T.; Karagiannidis, C.; Gründling, M.; Quintel, M.",Anaesthesist,169,28

The identification of biomarkers that can identify patients who will benefit from cancer immunotherapy is thus important. Here, we investigated the potential utility of the circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) integrity—a ratio of necrotic cell-derived, longer DNA fragments versus apoptotic cell-derived shorter fragments of Alu gene—as a biomarker of vaccine therapy for patients with ovarian cancer. We analyzed plasma samples from 39 patients with advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer enrolled in clinical trials for personalized peptide vaccinations. We observed that (1) the cfDNA integrity was decreased after the first cycle of vaccination, and (2) the decreased levels of cfDNA integrity were correlated with vaccine-induced immune responses; i.e., decreased cfDNA integrity was observed in 91.7% and 59.3% of the IgG-positive and negative patients, respectively (p = 0.0445). Similarly, decreased cfDNA integrity was observed in 92.9% and 56.0% of CTL response-positive and negative patients, respectively (p = 0.0283).

Cryo-electron microscopic analyses of EDF1 and its yeast homolog Mbf1 revealed a conserved 40S ribosomal subunit binding site at the mRNA entry channel near the collision interface. EDF1 recruits the translational repressors GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes to initiate a negative-feedback loop that prevents new ribosomes from translating defective mRNAs.

Following the isolation of rotavirus particles in 1969 and its evidence as an aetiology of severe dehydrating diarrhoea in infants and young children worldwide, the quest to find not only an acceptable and reliable but cost-effective vaccine has continued until now. Four live-attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines (LAORoVs) (Rotarix(®), RotaTeq(®), Rotavac(®), and RotaSIIL(®)) have been developed and licensed to be used against all forms of rotavirus-associated infection. The efficacy of these vaccines is more obvious in the high-income countries (HIC) compared with the low- to middle-income countries (LMICs); however, the impact is far exceeding in the low-income countries (LICs). Despite the rotavirus vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, more than 90 countries (mostly Asia, America, and Europe) are yet to implement any of these vaccines. Implementation of these vaccines has continued to suffer a setback in these countries due to the vaccine cost, policy, discharging of strategic preventive measures, and infrastructures. This review reappraises the impacts and effectiveness of the current live-attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines from many representative countries of the globe. It examines the problems associated with the low efficacy of these vaccines and the way forward.

Widely studied in tissues, SIRT1 is under evaluation as a plasmatic marker.

Eighty subjects were evaluated: 27 with anorexia nervosa (AN), 26 normal-weight and 27 with obesity. Bloodstream SIRT1, leptin and adiponectin (ELISA), total and trunk fat mass (FM) %, abdominal visceral adipose tissue, liver steatosis and epicardial fat thickness (EFT) were assessed. For each fat store, the coefficient of determination (R(2)) was used to evaluate the prediction capability of SIRT1, leptin and adiponectin. Plasma SIRT1 and adiponectin coherently decreased with the increase of FM, while the opposite occurred with leptin. Mean levels of each analyte were different between groups (p < 0.005). A significant association between plasma variables and FM depots was observed. SIRT1 showed a good predictive strength for FM, particularly in the obesity group, where the best R(2) was recorded for EFT (R(2) = 0.7). Blood SIRT1, adiponectin and leptin behave coherently with FM and there is synchrony between them. The association of SIRT1 with FM is substantially superimposable to that of adiponectin and leptin.

Natural and artificial melanin-based nanoparticles (MNP), including polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA NP), excel for their extraordinary combination of additional optical, electronic, chemical, photophysical, and photochemical properties. Thanks to these features, melanin plays an important multifunctional role in the design of new platforms for nanomedicine where this material works not only as a mechanical support or scaffold, but as an active component for imaging, even multimodal, and simple or synergistic therapy. The number of examples of bio-applications of MNP increased dramatically in the last decade. Here, we review the most recent ones, focusing on the multiplicity of functions that melanin performs in theranostics platforms with increasing complexity. For the sake of clarity, we start analyzing briefly the main properties of melanin and its derivative as well as main natural sources and synthetic methods, moving to imaging application from mono-modal (fluorescence, photoacoustic, and magnetic resonance) to multi-modal, and then to mono-therapy (drug delivery, anti-oxidant, photothermal, and photodynamic), and finally to theranostics and synergistic therapies, including gene- and immuno- in combination to photothermal and photodynamic. Nanomedicine aims not only at the treatment of diseases, but also to their prevention, and melanin in nature performs a protective action, in the form of nanopigment, against UV-Vis radiations and oxidants. With these functions being at the border between nanomedicine and cosmetics nanotechnology, recently examples of applications of artificial MNP in cosmetics are increasing, paving the road to the birth of the new science of nanocosmetics. In the last part of this review, we summarize and discuss these important recent results that establish evidence of the interconnection between nanomedicine and cosmetics nanotechnology.","Mavridi-Printezi, Alexandra; Guernelli, Moreno; Menichetti, Arianna; Montalti, Marco",Nanomaterials (Basel),169,1

The relatively frequent episodes of usage or attempting to use ricin in terrorist attacks reinforce the urge to develop an antidote for this toxin. In this sense, we selected in this work the current RTA (ricin catalytic subunit) inhibitor with the best experimental performance, as a reference molecule for virtual screening in the PubChem database. The selected molecules were then evaluated through docking studies, followed by drug-likeness investigation, molecular dynamics simulations and Molecular Mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) calculations. In every step, the selection of molecules was mainly based on their ability to occupy both the active and secondary sites of RTA, which are located right next to each other, but are not simultaneously occupied by the current RTA inhibitors. Results show that the three PubChem compounds 18309602, 18498053, and 136023163 presented better overall results than the reference molecule itself, showing up as new hits for the RTA inhibition, and encouraging further experimental evaluation.","Botelho, Fernanda D.; dos Santos, Marcelo C.; Gonçalves, Arlan da S.; Kuca, Kamil; Valis, Martin; LaPlante, Steven R.; França, Tanos C.

Corporate innovation in high-polluting industries improves the energy consumption efficiency and reduces the emission of air pollutant, which mitigates the conflict between environment and economy. Using the sample of China’s listed firms from 2010 to 2017, this study examines the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and financialization on corporate innovation in high-polluting industries. The results show that there is a positive association between CSR and corporate innovation, while there is a negative association between financialization and corporate innovation. Furthermore, the financialization of high-polluting firms can alleviate the promotion role of CSR in the innovation process. The financialization of state-owned enterprises in high-polluting industries may not have a crowding-out effect on research and development (R&D), but it can limit the R&D promotion effect of CSR engagements. In contrast, the financialization of non-state-owned enterprises will hinder corporate innovation, but it will not affect the association between CSR and technology innovation. We also find that the financialization of high-polluting firms with low financial constraints can alleviate the promotion role of CSR engagements in innovation. Meanwhile, the CSR engagements of high-polluting firms with high financial constraints play a stronger role in corporate innovation. During the implementation of environmental policies, the negative association between financialization and corporate innovation has been strengthened. Our findings can encourage high-polluting firms to make more efforts in environmental protection and social stability.","Zhao, Xue-Zhou; Chen, Jun; Chen, Feng-Wen; Wang, Wei; Xia, Senmao",Int J Environ Res Public Health,169,1

Here we use two complementary approaches to directly map the specificities of the neutralizing and binding antibodies of polyclonal anti-HIV-1 sera from rabbits immunized with BG505 Env SOSIP trimers. We used mutational antigenic profiling to determine how all mutations in Env affected viral neutralization and electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping (EMPEM) to directly visualize serum Fabs bound to Env trimers. The dominant neutralizing specificities were generally only a subset of the more diverse binding specificities. Additional differences between binding and neutralization reflected antigenicity differences between virus and soluble Env trimer. Furthermore, we refined residue-level epitope specificity directly from sera, revealing subtle differences across sera. Together, mutational antigenic profiling and EMPEM yield a holistic view of the binding and neutralizing specificity of polyclonal sera.","Dingens, Adam S; Pratap, Payal; Malone, Keara; Hilton, Sarah K; Ketas, Thomas; Cottrell, Christopher A; Overbaugh, Julie; Moore, John P; Klasse, PJ; Ward, Andrew B; Bloom, Jesse D",,169,1

There are a range of redox pairs in the cells/tissues responsible for redox homeostasis maintenance/regulation. In general, all redox elements are interconnected and regulated by various means, including antioxidant and vitagene networks. The redox status is responsible for maintenance of cell signaling and cell stress adaptation. Physiological roles of redox homeostasis maintenance in avian species, including poultry, have received limited attention and are poorly characterized. However, for the last 5 years, this topic attracted much attention, and a range of publications covered some related aspects. In fact, transcription factor Nrf2 was shown to be a master regulator of antioxidant defenses via activation of various vitagenes and other protective molecules to maintain redox homeostasis in cells/tissues. It was shown that Nrf2 is closely related to another transcription factor, namely, NF-κB, responsible for control of inflammation; however, its roles in poultry have not yet been characterized. Therefore, the aim of this review is to describe a current view on NF-κB functioning in poultry with a specific emphasis to its nutritional modulation under various stress conditions. In particular, on the one hand, it has been shown that, in many stress conditions in poultry, NF-κB activation can lead to increased synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines leading to systemic inflammation. On the other hand, there are a range of nutrients/supplements that can downregulate NF-κB and decrease the negative consequences of stress-related disturbances in redox homeostasis. In general, vitagene–NF-κB interactions in relation to redox balance homeostasis, immunity, and gut health in poultry production await further research.","Surai, Peter F.; Kochish, Ivan I.; Kidd, Michael T.",Antioxidants (Basel),169,1

Infection risk areas are mostly defined based on the incidence of human cases, a method which does not work well in areas with sporadic TBE cases. Thus, sentinel animals may help to better estimate the existing risk. Serological tests should be thoroughly evaluated for this purpose. Here, we tested three test formats to assess the use of dogs as sentinel animals. A total of 208 dog sera from a known endemic area in Southern Germany were tested in an All-Species-ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence assays (IIFA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sensitivity and specificity for both were determined in comparison to the micro-neutralization test (NT) results. Of all 208 samples, 22.1% tested positive in the micro-NT. A total of 18.3% of the samples showed characteristic fluorescence in the IIFA and were, thus, judged positive. In comparison to the micro-NT, a sensitivity of 78.3% and a specificity of 98.8% was obtained. In the ELISA, 19.2% of samples tested positive, with a sensitivity of 84.8% and a specificity of 99.4%. The ELISA is a highly specific test for TBE-antibody detection in dogs and should be well suited for acute diagnostics. However, due to deficits in sensitivity, it cannot replace the NT, at least for epidemiological studies. With even lower specificity and sensitivity, the same applies to IIFA.","Girl, Philipp; Haut, Maja; Riederer, Sandra; Pfeffer, Martin; Dobler, Gerhard",Microorganisms,169,1

Apicomplexans and chromerids are two phyla belonging to the alveolates. Apicomplexans are obligate intracellular parasites; that cannot complete their life cycle without exploiting a suitable host. Chromerids are mostly photoautotrophs as they can obtain energy from sunlight; and are considered ancestors of the apicomplexans. The pathogenicity and life cycle strategies differ significantly between parasitic alveolates; with some causing major losses in host populations while others seem harmless to the host. As the life cycles of some are still poorly understood, a better understanding of the factors which can affect the parasitic alveolates’ life cycles and survival is of great importance and may aid in new biomarker discovery. This study assessed new mechanisms relating to changes in protein structure and function (so-called “deimination” or “citrullination”) in two key parasites—an apicomplexan and a chromerid—to assess the pathways affected by this protein modification. Our findings point to novel regulatory mechanisms in these parasites’ lifecycles via protein deimination and may provide novel insights into their adaptability to different environments and hosts as well as host–pathogen coevolution. ABSTRACT: The alveolates (Superphylum Alveolata) comprise a group of primarily single-celled eukaryotes that have adopted extremely diverse modes of nutrition, such as predation, photoautotrophy and parasitism. The alveolates consists of several major phyla including the apicomplexans, a large group of unicellular, spore forming obligate intracellular parasites, and chromerids, which are believed to be the phototrophic ancestors of the parasitic apicomplexans. Molecular pathways involved in Alveolata host–pathogen interactions, epigenetic regulation and metabolism in parasite development remain to be fully understood. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are a phylogenetically conserved enzyme family which causes post-translational protein deimination, affecting protein function through the conversion of arginine to citrulline in a wide range of target proteins, contributing to protein moonlighting in physiological and pathological processes. The identification of deiminated protein targets in alveolate parasites may therefore provide novel insight into pathogen survival and host-pathogen interactions. The current study assessed PAD homologues and deiminated protein profiles of two alveolate parasites, Piridium sociabile (Chromerida) and Merocystis kathae (Apicomplexa). Histological analysis verified strong cytoplasmic PAD expression in both Alveolates, detected deiminated proteins in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the alveolate parasites and verified the presence of citrullinated histone H3 in Alveolata nucleus, indicating roles in epigenetic regulation. Histone H3 citrullination was also found significantly elevated in the host tissue, indicative of neutrophil extracellular trap formation, a host-defence mechanism against a range of pathogens, particularly those that are too large for phagocytosis. Proteomic analysis of deiminated proteins from both Alveolata identified GO and KEGG pathways strongly relating to metabolic and genetic regulation, with some species-specific differences between the apicomplexan and the chromerid. Our findings provide novel insights into roles for the conserved PAD/ADI enzyme family in the regulation of metabolic and epigenetic pathways in alveolate parasites, possibly also relating to their life cycle and host–pathogen interactions.","Kristmundsson, Árni; Erlingsdóttir, Ásthildur; Lange, Sigrun",Biology (Basel),169,1

Enhanced coagulation could further exacerbate inflammation. Identifying key signaling molecule(s) that drive both inflammation and coagulation may help devise effective therapeutic strategies to treat inflammatory and thrombotic disorders. The aim of the current study is to determine the role of Gab2 (Grb2-associated binder2), which is known to play a crucial role in the signaling evoked by growth factors and antigen receptors, in inflammatory signaling pathways and its contribution to vascular dysfunction. APPROACH AND RESULTS: WT (wild type) and Gab2-silenced endothelial cells were treated with TNFα (tumor necrosis factor alpha), IL (interleukin)-1β, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Activation of key signaling proteins in the inflammatory signaling pathways and expression of cell adhesion molecules, TF, and inflammatory cytokines were analyzed. Gab2(−/)(−) and WT littermate mice were challenged with LPS or S pneumoniae (Streptococcus pneumoniae), and parameters of inflammation and activation of coagulation were assessed. Gab2 silencing in endothelial cells markedly attenuated TNFα-induced, IL-1β–induced, and LPS-induced expression of TF, cell adhesion molecules, and inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Gab2 silencing suppressed TNFα-induced, IL-1β–induced, and LPS-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of TAK1 (transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1) and activation of MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) and NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B). Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that the Src kinase Fyn phosphorylates Gab2. Gab2(−/−) mice are protected from LPS or S pneumoniae–induced vascular permeability, neutrophil infiltration, thrombin generation, NET formation, cytokine production, and lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies identify, for the first time, that Gab2 integrates signaling from multiple inflammatory receptors and regulates vascular inflammation and thrombosis.","Kondreddy, Vijay; Magisetty, Jhansi; Keshava, Shiva; Rao, L.

This activity has characteristics of innate immunity: it acts on all retroviruses and thus is neither epitope specific nor HLA restricted. The HIV-associated CNAR does not affect other virus families. It is mediated, at least in part, by a CD8(+) T cell antiviral factor (CAF) that blocks HIV transcription. A variety of assays used to measure CNAR/CAF and the effects on other retrovirus infections are described. Notably, CD8(+) T cell noncytotoxic antiviral responses have now been observed with other virus families but are mediated by different cytokines. Characterizing the protein structure of CAF has been challenging despite many biologic, immunologic, and molecular studies.

International guidelines have stated the need for a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether a non-invasive outpatient (shockwave lithotripsy [SWL]) or surgical (ureteroscopy [URS]) intervention should be the first-line treatment for those needing active intervention. This has implications for shaping clinical pathways. OBJECTIVE: To report a pragmatic multicentre non-inferiority RCT comparing SWL with URS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This trial tested for non-inferiority of up to two sessions of SWL compared with URS as initial treatment for ureteric stones requiring intervention. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary outcome was whether further intervention was required to clear the stone, and secondary outcomes included quality of life assessment, severity of pain, and serious complications; these were based on questionnaires at baseline, 8 wk, and 6 mo. We included patients over 16 yr with a single ureteric stone clinically deemed to require intervention. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were planned. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The study recruited between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2017. We recruited 613 participants from a total of 1291 eligible patients, randomising 306 to SWL and 307 to URS. Sixty-seven patients (22.1%) in the SWL arm needed further treatment compared with 31 patients (10.3%) in the URS arm. The absolute risk difference was 11.7% (95% confidence interval 5.6%, 17.8%) in favour of URS, which was inside the 20% threshold we set for demonstrating noninferiority of SWL. CONCLUSIONS: This RCT was designed to test whether SWL is non-inferior to URS and confirmed this; although SWL is an outpatient noninvasive treatment with potential advantages both for patients and for reducing the use of inpatient health care resources, the trial showed a benefit in overall clinical outcomes with URS compared with SWL, reflecting contemporary practice. The Therapeutic Interventions for Stones of the Ureter (TISU) study provides new evidence to help guide the choice of modality for this common health condition. PATIENT SUMMARY: We present the largest trial comparing ureteroscopy versus extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy for ureteric stones. While ureteroscopy had marginally improved outcome in terms of stone clearance, as expected, shockwave lithotripsy had better results in terms of health care costs. These results should enable patients and health care providers to optimise treatment pathways for this common urological condition.","Dasgupta, Ranan; Cameron, Sarah; Aucott, Lorna; MacLennan, Graeme; Thomas, Ruth E.; Kilonzo, Mary M.; Lam, Thomas B.L.; N’Dow, James; Norrie, John; Anson, Ken; Burgess, Neil; Clark, Charles T.; Keeley, Francis X.; MacLennan, Sara J.; Starr, Kath; McClinton, Sam",Eur Urol,169,1

Although microglia have been the focus of work linking neuroinflammation and associated dementias like Alzheimer’s Disease, the inflammatory milieu of brain is a conglomerate of cross-talk amongst microglia, systemic immune cells and soluble mediators like cytokines. Age-related changes in the inflammatory profile at the levels of both the brain and periphery are largely orchestrated by immune system cells. Strong evidence indicates that both innate and adaptive immune cells, the latter including T cells and B cells, contribute to chronic neuroinflammation and thus dementia. Neurodegenerative hallmarks coupled with more traditional immune system stimuli like infection or injury likely combine to trigger and maintain persistent microglial and thus brain inflammation. This review summarizes age-related changes in immune cell function, with special emphasis on lymphocytes as a source of inflammation, and discusses how such changes may potentiate both systemic and central nervous system inflammation to culminate in dementia. We recap the understudied area of AD-associated changes in systemic lymphocytes in greater detail to provide a unifying perspective of inflammation-fueled dementia, with an eye toward evidence of two-way communication between the brain parenchyma and blood immune cells. We focused our review on human subjects studies, adding key data from animal models as relevant.","Lutshumba, Jenny; Nikolajczyk, Barbara S.; Bachstetter, Adam D.",Front Cell Neurosci,169,1

It has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. There have been reported cases of successful treatment of MRSA bacteremia with this agent. Common adverse drug reactions from ceftaroline include skin rash, hives, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is a rare untoward drug reaction associated with it. We report a case of fever and acute hypoxic respiratory failure with bilateral interstitial pulmonary infiltrates while on ceftaroline therapy for sternal osteomyelitis and ascending aortic graft infection secondary to MRSA. Laboratory studies revealed peripheral blood eosinophilia (>3000 cells/mm(3)). After exclusion of infectious, autoimmune, and other extrinsic allergic causes of pneumonia, ceftaroline-related acute eosinophilic pneumonia was suspected. Ceftaroline was discontinued and a therapeutic trial of high-dose steroid was initiated. Significant improvement of clinical symptoms and hypoxia was achieved after 24 h of steroid therapy. There was no recurrence of clinical symptoms after completing steroid course, which supported our suspicion of acute eosinophilic pneumonia from ceftaroline. Radiographic improvement of pulmonary infiltrates occurred 4 weeks later with complete resolution at 3 months from the initial event. The current case adds to this rarely reported adverse effect from this relatively newer antimicrobial agent. Increased awareness, early recognition, discontinuation of medication, and steroid therapy are key in favorable clinical outcome and recovery.","Min, Zaw; Elrufay, Rawiya; Cho, Christian Y; Elapavaluru, Subbarao; Bhanot, Nitin",Lung India,169,1

All neonates less than 28 days old with a diagnosis of PH were prospectively enrolled in a tertiary care center for 1 year. Two echocardiograms were performed by a trained neonatologist. The first echocardiogram was performed at the time of diagnosis, whereas the second was performed just after basic therapeutic optimization. The cohort included 27 neonates. Mean gestational age at birth was 36.1 weeks gestational age (WGA) (SD: 4) and mean birth weight was 2658 g (SD: 907). Six neonates (22%) died before day 28, with a median age at death of 48 h (IQR [33; 89]). Although the first echocardiogram showed no difference, the second highlighted a strong link between the persistence of right-to left-shunt and death (p = 0.002). We showed a link between right-to-left shunt and a poor outcome (death or morbidity) after therapeutic optimization among premature and full-term neonates suffering from PH. We recommend repeating echocardiography after basic therapeutic optimization and for prognostic purposes, taking into account only the second examination. Larger cohorts are needed to confirm these results.

The surface catalyzed reaction is added to the homogeneous-heterogeneous reaction that triggers the rate of the chemical reaction. The added feature of the variable thermal conductivity and the viscosity instead of their constant values also boosts the novelty of the undertaken problem. The modeled problem is erected in the form of a system of partial differential equations. Engaging similarity transformation, the set of ordinary differential equations are obtained. The coupled equations are numerically solved by using the bvp4c built-in MATLAB function. The drag coefficient and Nusselt number are plotted for arising parameters. The results revealed that increasing surface catalyzed parameter causes a decline in thermal profile more efficiently. Further, the power-law index is more influential than the variable thickness disk index. The numerical results show that variations in dimensionless thickness coefficient do not make any effect. However, increasing power-law index causing an upsurge in radial, axial, tangential, velocities, and thermal profile.","Yu, Bai; Ramzan, Muhammad; Riasat, Saima; Kadry, Seifedine; Chu, Yu-Ming; Malik, M.

METHODS: We included patients with human rabies who attended a reference hospital in the state of Ceará during 1976-2019. RESULTS: Data were available for 63 out of 171 (36.8%) patients. Of these patients, 48 (76.2%) were attacked by dogs. In recent years, wild animals have been the most common aggressor species (marmosets and bats). Only 39 (70%) patients were initially correctly suspected with rabies. Bites were the most frequent exposure (56; 96%), most commonly on the hands (21; 42%) and the head (9; 18.4%). Only 14 (22%) patients had sought medical assistance before the onset of symptoms, and only one completed post-exposure prophylaxis. The most prevalent signs and symptoms included aggressiveness/irritability (50; 79.4%), fever (42; 66.7%), sore throat/dysphagia (40; 63.5%), and myalgia (28; 44.4%). Hydrophobia was present in 17 patients (22.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of human rabies in Ceará occurred due to the failure to seek medical assistance and/or the failure of the health system in initiating early post-exposure prophylaxis. There is a need for specific information and education campaigns focusing on the cycle of sylvatic rabies as well as prevention measures. Health professionals should undergo refresher training courses on the signs and symptoms of rabies and on the specific epidemiological features of the disease in Brazil.","Duarte, Naylê Francelino Holanda; Pires, Roberto da Justa; Viana, Victoria Forte; Feijão, Levi Ximenes; Alencar, Carlos Henrique; Heukelbach, Jorg",,169,1

The aim of this work was to provide a clear overview of rare cochlear diseases, taking into account the embryonic development of the cochlea and the systematic presentation of the different disorders. Although rapid biotechnological and bioinformatic advances may facilitate the diagnosis of a rare disease, an interdisciplinary exchange is often required to raise the suspicion of a rare disease. It is important to recognize that the phenotype of rare inner ear diseases can vary greatly not only in non-syndromic but also in syndromic hearing disorders. Finally, it becomes clear that the phenotype of the individual rare diseases cannot be determined exclusively by classical genetics even in monogenetic disorders.","Warnecke, Athanasia; Giesemann, Anja",Laryngorhinootologie,169,1

OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of patients treated by prehospital emergency services that have the potential to be directly allocated to a primary care provider. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preclinical and clinical data of adult patients who in a 2-month period were transported to the ED of a university hospital by an ambulance were evaluated. To determine a safe and meaningful transport directly to a doctor’s office, a stepwise assessment was carried out: patients were categorized on the basis of the prehospital assessment of urgency as “urgent” (contact to doctor necessary within a maximum time of 30 min) and “less urgent” (contact to doctor not necessary within 30 min, maximum 120 min). “Less urgent” patients were further divided and those treated as outpatients were identified. This group was further restricted to cases whose administrative reception in the ED was documented Monday–Friday between 8 am and 7 pm. In addition, these cases were further differentiated with regard to medical content and compared with the triage results in the ED (Manchester Triage, MTS). RESULTS: In all, 1260 patients were brought to the ED by ambulance within the study period (total number of patients treated in this time period n = 11,506); 894 cases had a documented prehospital level of urgency and could therefore be included. Of these n = 477 (53.4%) were categorized as “less urgent”; 317 (66.5%) of these “less urgent” cases were treated as outpatients in the ED, and n = 114 (23.9%) in a time frame potentially suitable for direct transport to doctors’ offices, which is 1% of all patients treated in the ED in the time period examined. However, 70 of the cases suitable for doctors’ office (63.6% of n = 110 with documented MTS) were rated more urgent in the ED. With regards to prehospital complaints and documented diagnosis we assume employment of a relevant amount of resources in the treatment of these cases. CONCLUSIONS: EDs could be relieved from every tenth patient brought in by prehospital emergency services (1% of all patients treated) during normal offices hours by direct allocation to doctors’ offices. Regarding patient’s safety this process however has to be seen critically as > 60% of these cases were potentially undertriaged. Necessary resources for diagnostics and treatment have to be available in the doctors’ offices and known to prehospital emergency services. Primary assignment of patients to doctors’ offices by prehospital emergency can only relieve urban EDs to a negligible extent, is potentially dangerous and linked to a tremendous logistic effort.","Lindner, Tobias; Campione, Alessandro; Möckel, Martin; Henschke, Cornelia; Dahmen, Janosch; Slagman, Anna",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,169,1

Biomedical sensors (e.g., wearables) can assist with determining treatment plans for individuals, provide quantitative information to healthcare providers, and give objective measurements of health, leading to the goal of precise phenotypic correlates for genotypes. Even though treatments and interventions are becoming more specific and datasets more abundant, measuring the causal impact of health interventions requires careful considerations of complex covariate structures, as well as knowledge of the temporal and spatial properties of the data. Thus, interpreting biomedical sensor data needs to make use of specialized statistical models. Here, we show how the Bayesian structural time series framework, widely used in economics, can be applied to these data. This framework corrects for covariates to provide accurate assessments of the significance of interventions. Furthermore, it allows for a time-dependent confidence interval of impact, which is useful for considering individualized assessments of intervention efficacy. We provide a customized biomedical adaptor tool, MhealthCI, around a specific implementation of the Bayesian structural time series framework that uniformly processes, prepares, and registers diverse biomedical data. We apply the software implementation of MhealthCI to a structured set of examples in biomedicine to showcase the ability of the framework to evaluate interventions with varying levels of data richness and covariate complexity and also compare the performance to other models. Specifically, we show how the framework is able to evaluate an exercise intervention’s effect on stabilizing blood glucose in a diabetes dataset. We also provide a future-anticipating illustration from a behavioral dataset showcasing how the framework integrates complex spatial covariates. Overall, we show the robustness of the Bayesian structural time series framework when applied to biomedical sensor data, highlighting its increasing value for current and future datasets.","Liu, Jason; Spakowicz, Daniel J.; Ash, Garrett I.; Hoyd, Rebecca; Ahluwalia, Rohan; Zhang, Andrew; Lou, Shaoke; Lee, Donghoon; Zhang, Jing; Presley, Carolyn; Greene, Ann; Stults-Kolehmainen, Matthew; Nally, Laura M.; Baker, Julien S.; Fucito, Lisa M.; Weinzimer, Stuart A.; Papachristos, Andrew V.; Gerstein, Mark",PLoS Comput Biol,169,1

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s standard measure—any tobacco product use in the past 30 days—considers neither frequency of use nor product risk implications. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how nicotine product use, including frequency of use, and its associated risks have changed among middle school and high school students since 1999. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used data from the 1999-2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey, an in-school survey of a nationally representative sample of students in grades 6 through 12; each survey recruited between 15 000 and 36 000 participants. EXPOSURES: Nicotine product use in the past 30 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Use of nicotine products assessed by nicotine product days (NPDs), the number of days that the average student consumed these products in the past 30 days. Risk-adjusted NPDs account for differential long-term health risks of various products. RESULTS: This study included 16 years of cross-sectional survey data. Each survey recruited between 15 000 and 36 000 participants in grades 6 through 12 (male students: mean, 50.4% [minimum, 48.5%; maximum, 58.4%]; mean age, 14.5 years [minimum, 14.0 years; maximum, 14.7 years]). Nationally representative cross-sectional data for high school students showed that NPDs decreased steadily from 5.6 days per month in 1999 (95% CI, 5.0-6.2 days per month) to 2.2 days per month in 2017 (95% CI, 1.9-2.6 days per month), increased to 4.6 days per month in 2019 (95% CI, 4.1-5.1 days per month), and then decreased to 3.6 days per month in 2020 (95% CI, 3.0-4.1 days per month). For a risk weight of 0.1 for e-cigarettes, compared with combustible products, risk-adjusted NPDs decreased from 2.5 days per month in 2013 (95% CI, 2.2-2.9 days per month) (prior to the popularity of e-cigarettes) to 2.0 days per month in 2019 (95% CI, 1.6-2.5 days per month) and 1.4 days per month in 2020 (95% CI, 1.0-1.8 days per month). However, with a risk weight of 1.0 for e-cigarettes (identical to that of combustible products), risk-adjusted NPDs increased to 5.3 days per month in 2019 (95% CI, 4.4-6.2 days per month) and 3.9 days per month in 2020 (95% CI, 3.1-4.7 days per month). Similar trends were found for middle school students. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that NPDs represent an improvement, albeit an imperfect one, compared with any 30-day tobacco product use by incorporating the frequency of use of various products. By distinguishing products, NPDs permit consideration of the health consequences associated with different mixes of products over time. Health risks of adolescent nicotine product use could have decreased during vaping’s popularity if assessment of the long-term risks associated with vaping compared with those of smoking is low. There is a need to closely monitor youth nicotine and tobacco product use patterns.","Sun, Ruoyan; Mendez, David; Warner, Kenneth E.",JAMA Netw Open,169,13

METHODS: One hundred thirty-six patients undergoing laparoscopic colon resection randomly received either TEA or TAP with ropivacaine only. The primary endpoint was opioid requirement up to 48 h postoperatively. Intensity of pain, time to onset of bowel function, time to mobilization, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and patients’ satisfaction with pain management were also assessed. RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in opioid consumption on the day of surgery with TEA compared with TAP block (30 mg vs 14 mg, p < 0.001). On the first two postoperative days (POD), the balance shifted to opioid consumption being smaller in the TAP group: on POD 1 (15.2 mg vs 10.6 mg; p = 0.086) and on POD 2 (9.2 mg vs 4.6 mg; p = 0.021). There were no differences in postoperative nausea/vomiting or time to first postoperative bowel movement between the groups. No direct blockade-related complications were observed and the length of stay was similar between TEA and TAP groups. CONCLUSION: TEA is more efficient for acute postoperative pain than TAP block on day of surgery, but not on the first two PODs. No differences in pain management-related complications were detected.

METHODS: In this mixed methods multicenter cluster randomized trial, we included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and their primary care clinicians. We compared usual care with or without a within-encounter SDM conversation aid. We assessed participant-reported decisions made and quality of SDM (knowledge, satisfaction, and decisional conflict), clinical outcomes, adherence, and observer-based patient involvement in decision-making (OPTION12-scale). We used semi-structured interviews with patients to understand their perspectives. RESULTS: We enrolled 350 patients and 99 clinicians from 20 practices and interviewed 26 patients. Use of the conversation aid increased post-encounter patient knowledge (correct answers, 52% vs. 45%, p = 0.02) and clinician involvement of patients (Mean between-arm difference in OPTION12, 7.3 (95% CI 3, 12); p = 0.003). There were no between-arm differences in treatment choice, patient or clinician satisfaction, encounter length, medication adherence, or glycemic control. Qualitative analyses highlighted differences in how clinicians involved patients in decision making, with intervention patients noting how clinicians guided them through conversations using factors important to them. CONCLUSIONS: Using an SDM conversation aid improved patient knowledge and involvement in SDM without impacting treatment choice, encounter length, medication adherence or improved diabetes control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

However, while they may curb growing overweight and obesity rates, widespread adoption is yet to be achieved. Hence, profound knowledge regarding factors motivating and hindering (long-term) nutrition app use is crucial for developing design guidelines aimed at supporting uptake and prolonged use of nutrition apps. OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on barriers to and facilitators for nutrition app use across disciplines including empirical qualitative and quantitative studies with current users, ex-users, and nonusers of nutrition apps. METHODS: A systematic literature search including 6 databases (PubMed, Web of Science, PsychINFO, PSYNDEX, PsycArticles, and SPORTDiscus) as well as backward and forward citation search was conducted. Search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the planned data extraction process were preregistered. All empirical qualitative and quantitative studies published in German or English were eligible for inclusion if they examined adolescents (aged 13-18) or adults who were either current users, ex-users, and nonusers of nutrition apps. Based on qualitative content analysis, extracted individual barriers and facilitators were grouped into categories. RESULTS: A total of 28 publications were identified as eligible. A framework with a 3-level hierarchy was designed which grouped 328 individual barriers and facilitators into 23 subcategories, 12 categories, and 4 clusters that focus on either the individual user (goal setting and goal striving, motivation, routines, lack of awareness of knowledge), different aspects of the app and the smartphone (features, usability of the app or food database, technical issues, data security, accuracy/trustworthiness, costs), positive and negative outcomes of nutrition app use, or interactions between the user and their social environment. CONCLUSIONS: The resulting conceptual framework underlines a pronounced diversity of reasons for (not) using nutrition apps, indicating that there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach for uptake and prolonged use of nutrition apps. Hence, tailoring nutrition apps to needs of specific user groups seems promising for increasing engagement.","König, Laura Maria; Attig, Christiane; Franke, Thomas; Renner, Britta",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,169,13

Online user reviews, such as content reviews and star ratings, are an important basis for reflecting users’ views on the effectiveness of health services. Here, we used user reviews related to online psychological consultation services for content feature mining and usefulness analyses. We used a professional online psychological counseling service platform in China to collect user reviews that were liked by users as a data sample for a content analysis. An LDA topic model, dictionary-based sentiment analysis, and the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon were used to extract the topic, sentiment, and context features of the content of 4254 useful reviews, and the influence of these features on the usefulness of the reviews was verified by a multiple linear regression analysis. Our results show that the content of online reviews by psychological counseling users presented a positive emotional attitude as a whole and expressed more views on the process, effects, and future expectations of counseling than on other topics. There was a significant correlation between the topic, sentiment, and context features of a user review and its usefulness: reviews giving high scores and containing topics such as “ease emotions” and “consulting expectations” received more user likes. However, the usefulness of a review was significantly reduced if it was in existence for too long. This research provides valuable suggestions for understanding the needs and emotional attitudes of users with mental health problems in terms of online psychological consultation; identifying the factors that affect the number of likes a review receives can help platform users write better consultation evaluations and thereby provide greater usefulness.

SD may thus serve as a real-time mechanistic biomarker for impending parenchyma damage in patients during neurocritical care. Using subdural platinum/iridium (Pt/Ir) electrodes, SD is observed as a large negative direct current (DC) shift. Besides SD, there are other causes of DC shifts that are not to be confused with SD. Here, we systematically analyzed DC artifacts in ventilated patients by observing changes in the fraction of inspired oxygen. For the same change in blood oxygenation, we found that negative and positive DC shifts can simultaneously occur at adjacent Pt/Ir electrodes. METHODS: Nurses and intensivists typically increase blood oxygenation by increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen at the ventilator before performing manipulations on the patient. We retrospectively identified 20 such episodes in six patients via tissue partial pressure of oxygen (p(ti)O(2)) measurements with an intracortical O(2) sensor and analyzed the associated DC shifts. In vitro, we compared Pt/Ir with silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) to assess DC responses to changes in pO(2), pH, or 5-min square voltage pulses and investigated the effect of electrode polarization on pO(2)-induced DC artifacts. RESULTS: Hyperoxygenation episodes started from a p(ti)O(2) of 37 (30–40) mmHg (median and interquartile range) reaching 71 (50–97) mmHg. During a total of 20 episodes on each of six subdural Pt/Ir electrodes in six patients, we observed 95 predominantly negative responses in six patients, 25 predominantly positive responses in four patients, and no brain activity changes. Adjacent electrodes could show positive and negative responses simultaneously. In vitro, Pt/Ir in contrast with Ag/AgCl responded to changes in either pO(2) or pH with large DC shifts. In response to square voltage pulses, Pt/Ir falsely showed smaller DC shifts than Ag/AgCl, with the worst performance under anoxia. In response to pO(2) increase, Pt/Ir showed DC positivity when positively polarized and DC negativity when negatively polarized. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of pO(2)-induced subdural DC shifts by approximately 6 mV was similar to that of SDs, but they did not show a sequential onset at adjacent recording sites, could be either predominantly negative or positive in contrast with the always negative DC shifts of SD, and were not accompanied by brain activity depression. Opposing polarities of pO(2)-induced DC artifacts may result from differences in baseline electrode polarization or subdural p(ti)O(2) inhomogeneities relative to subdermal p(ti)O(2) at the quasi-reference.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of LTCF residents with positive nasopharyngeal or mid-turbinate swabs for CoVs (OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1) between January 2013 and December 2018. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from resident charts including clinical presentation, treatment, outcome, and transmission to other residents. Variables were compared using univariate analysis. RESULTS: 3268 residents met inclusion criteria (median age 93 years, 90% male) comprising 7.5% (246/3268) of all positive respiratory virus specimens detected during the study period. 97(39%) of cases were associated with a respiratory outbreak while 149(61%) were sporadic cases that did not result in transmission. OC43 (52%) was the most commonly identified CoV and was more commonly associated with outbreak cases (76% vs. 37%; P < 0.001). In total, 87% of all cases had two or more of runny nose/congestion, cough, sore throat/hoarse voice or fever. The most common symptoms among residents were cough (85%), runny nose/congestion (79%), and sore throat/hoarse voice (59%) and only 17% of residents had a measured temperature of ≥ 37.8C. Only 6% of residents received antibiotic treatment for suspected secondary bacterial pneumonia. The 30-day mortality rate was 3.7% with 67% of deaths attributable to the CoV infection. There was no statistically significant difference in symptoms, treatment or outcomes associated with outbreaks or seasonality. CONCLUSION: CoVs make up an important proportion of respiratory viral infections among LTCF residents and may result in frequent outbreaks. Most residents remain afebrile and have self-limited illness while only a small minority develop secondary bacterial pneumonia and death. Given these findings the benefits of control measures should be weighed against the impact on resident quality of life.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of GCV-R CMV infection in a high-risk population. METHODS: We performed a single-center, retrospective cohort study of lung transplant recipients with genotype confirmed GCV-R CMV and ganciclovir-sensitive (GCV-S) CMV infection, matched (1:3) by year of diagnosis. Clinical outcomes within 1 year following the onset of CMV infection and total hospital costs were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were included in the analysis: 7 with GCV-R CMV infection and 21 with GCV-S CMV infection. Baseline demographics (Table 1) were similar in the two groups. CMV load at diagnosis was numerically higher (282,932 I.U./mL [IQR, 43,181 IU/mL 3,368,931 I.U./mL] vs. 44,604 IU/mL [IQR, 6,314 I.U./mL 88,797 IU/mL], P = 0.10) and days to CMV infection following discontinuation of antiviral prophylaxis was numerically lower (20 [IQR, 0–137] vs. 175 [IQR, 123–190], P = 0.07) in the GCV-R CMV group. All-cause mortality (71.4% vs. 19.0%, P = 0.02) and total hospital days due to CMV infection (63 [IQR, 34–76] vs. 6 [IQR, 2–9], P < 0.01) were significantly higher in the GCV-R CMV cohort. There were no differences in allograft rejection and hospital readmission between the two groups. Total hospital costs were significantly higher amongst patients with GCV-R CMV infection ($208,924 [IQR, $114,555-$253,191] vs. $20,419 [IQR, $12,438-$27,892], P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: GCV-R CMV infection is associated with poor outcomes and considerable healthcare costs. Novel prophylaxis and treatment strategies are needed to combat CMV infection in lung transplant recipients. DISCLOSURES: T. Patel, Merck: Grant Investigator, Research grant. K.

Several of these genes have been found to play key roles in the process of autophagy, a lysosome-based degradation pathway. Although historically considered to be a relatively nonselective process of degradation of cytosolic contents, autophagy has recently been revealed to have several selective and immune-specific functions that are relevant to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, including xenophagy, mitophagy, antigen presentation, secretion, and inflammasome regulation. In this chapter, we review the evidence that links autophagy-related genes, their immune-specific functions, and possible mechanisms of IBD pathogenesis. We summarize the basic molecular events underlying general and selective autophagy, and present evidence suggesting possible pathogenic mechanisms revealed by studies of IBD-associated risk alleles of ATG16L1 and IRGM.

Different technologies have been adopted acting as primary, secondary, and tertiary steps, the most widely applied technology being conventional activated sludge (CAS), followed by membrane bioreactor (MBR). Other types of technology were also investigated. Referring to the removal efficiency of macro- and micro-pollutants, the collected data demonstrates good removal efficiency of macro-pollutants using the current adopted technologies, while the removal of micro-pollutants (pharmaceutical substances) varies from low to high removal and release of some compounds was also observed.

Viruses show characteristic infectivity, virulence and pathogenicity. The most well established host factors are age, sex and race, but other host biological and behavioral factors affect acquisition of viral infection and/or its course and manifestations. The physical, chemical and biological environment operates on the virus itself and may also alter the host biological or behavioral response. Viral infections have incubation periods lasting days or weeks, while their pathologic sequelae may not manifest for years or decades. Likewise the degree or intensity of host response and clinical expression may range from largely inapparent to highly lethal. The degree of cell, tissue and organ specificity is high. Common syndromes involve the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central nervous systems, the liver, and mucocutaneous surfaces. Vertical transmission may produce a variety of congenital and perinatal conditions. Viruses spread by multiple modes, using nearly every bodily surface or fluid as a route of exit or entry, either by direct contact or indirectly through an animal vector or other inanimate vehicle. Different viral Infections occur nearly ubiquitously or sporadically; they may be present continuously throughout a population (endemic) or occur in seasonal rhythm or in unexpectedly explosive form (epidemic). Many viruses are refractory to all known therapeutic agents, while for a few, the increasing number of highly effective agents holds great promise. Vaccines have produced many historical successes including the ultimate goal of eradication, but many viral infections continue to elude effective vaccine development. Major government and private sector programs for treatment and prevention have raised expectations of successful control for certain widespread and serious viral diseases; however, in every case a unique set of scientific, socioeconomic, political and behavioral barriers remains to be overcome.","Kaslow, Richard A.",Viral Infections of Humans,169,17

Through the effects of hemolysis and vaso-occlusion, it has the potential to incite critical illness involving multiple organ systems. Children with sickle cell disease are at risk of multiple types of shock resulting in a need for ICU care. Our youngest patients with sickle cell disease are at highest risk of infection due to lack of splenic function, and this can present with septic shock. Hypovolemic shock can occur secondary to severe acute anemia as seen with splenic sequestration or a delayed transfusion reaction. As one ages, the risk of cardiac dysfunction – diastolic and systolic dysfunction as well as pulmonary hypertension – can result in cardiogenic shock. In addition to shock, patients with sickle cell disease are at risk for respiratory failure from acute chest syndrome as well as acute neurologic deterioration from stroke. For these reasons, critical care physicians must be familiar with the unique management of sickle cell complications in order to provide the best possible care for this vulnerable population.","Rosanwo, Tolulope; McArthur, Jennifer A.; Archer, Natasha",Critical Care of the Pediatric Immunocompromised Hematology/Oncology Patient,169,1

Carnivores are among the most successful mammalian invaders. As such, a number of middle-sized representatives (“mesocarnivores”) such as the domestic cat and mongooses have been pinpointed for their deleterious impact on the native fauna. In the MB, three species of mongooses (Herpestidae) and one genet (Viverridae) are or have recently been recorded and none of them has been considered native: the Indian grey mongoose Herpestes edwardsii, the small Indian mongoose H. auropunctatus, the Egyptian mongoose H. ichneumon, and the common genet Genetta genetta. In order to clarify the history of introduction and status of the mongooses and genet in Europe, I review various bodies of evidence including (1) their natural history and relationships with humans in their native ranges, (2) their history of introduction in Europe, (3) the enlightenments—and sometimes contradictions—brought by recent genetic analyses on their dispersal histories, and (4) their range dynamics and ecological interactions with the European fauna. The species of herpestids and viverrids present in Europe fall into three categories: (1) introduced and spreading (G. genetta, H. auropunctatus), (2) introduced and extinct (H. edwardsii), and (3) natural disperser and spreading (H. ichneumon). In view of the reviewed evidence, there is weak support for a deleterious impact of the mongooses and genet on the European fauna (except possibly on the herpetofauna of small Adriatic islands in the case of H. auropunctatus), notably in comparison with genuine invasive species such as the black rat and the domestic cat. Rather than inefficient control programs such as those targeting H. ichneumon in Portugal and H. auropunctatus in Croatia, we suggest that a greater attention is focused on the restoration of large Carnivores (the natural regulators of mesocarnivore populations), mesocarnivore communities and natural habitats, to contribute to a more sustainable way of “managing” the mongooses and genet in Europe.","Gaubert, Philippe",Problematic Wildlife,169,1

Especially surfaces close to the patients’ environment may be touched at high frequencies, allowing transmission from animated sources to others via contaminated inanimate surfaces. Therefore, the knowledge on the survival of bacteria, fungi, viruses and protozoa on surfaces, and hence, in a broader sense, in the human environment, is important for implementing tactics for prevention of Healthcare-acquired Infections (HAI). This chapter will elaborate the role of surfaces in the transmission of pathogens. Particular emphasis is laid on the current knowledge of the survival time and conditions favouring survival of the pathogens. Finally, mechanisms of transmission from inanimate surfaces to patients are highlighted. Within the multi-barrier strategy of the prevention of HAI, environmental disinfection policies should be based on risk assessments for surfaces with different risks for cross contamination such as high- and low-touched surfaces with appropriate standards for adequate disinfection measures under consideration of the persistence and infectious dose of the pathogens. As a result, surface disinfection is indicated in the following situations: Frequently touched surfaces adjacent to patients. Surfaces with assumed or visible contamination. Terminal disinfection in rooms or areas where infected or colonized patients with easily transferable nosocomial pathogens are cared for, and in outbreak situations. Furthermore, the knowledge of the persistence of pathogens will also support ensuring the biosafety in microbiological and biomedical laboratories, food-handling settings, and for hygienic behaviour in the everyday life to prevent transmission of infectious diseases.","Kramer, Axel; Assadian, Ojan",Use of Biocidal Surfaces for Reduction of Healthcare Acquired Infections,169,11

At the same time, China also issued a series of national regulatory policies to encourage domestic drug innovations (Ding, J Technol Manage Innov 6(2):1–13, 2011) . Therefore, both those policies for incentive innovations and the IPR laws have played important roles in drug development in China.

In agreement with those statistics are the FSIS microbiological results for Escherichia coli O157:H7 in raw ground beef, which also showed a decrease in 2003. But there is much work to be done in food safety and much more to achieve. It is imperative that while addressing food-safety issues, we should understand the role that the environmental microbiology, public health epidemiology, aerobiology, molecular microbial ecology, occupational health, industrial processes, municipal water quality, and animal health have on food safety. Although it is a difficult task, a concerted effort by industry, academic, and governmental researchers can accomplish the goal. Here we discuss the future directions and applications in the distribution and spread of foodborne hazards, methods for microbial detection and differentiation, intervention strategies for farm pathogen reduction, targeting waste at animal production sites, considerations on antimicrobial resistance, food-safety storage and preparation strategies, food irradiation, new and emerging food-safety hazards, and quantitative microbial food-safety risk assessment. Although this does not comprise an exhaustive list of food-safety issues, these are the areas that, we think, require considerable attention by researchers. Not only we need to strive to improve food safety through new strategies, processes, and applications, but we also need to be flexible and observant to readily handle the new and emerging food-safety problems, whether they are within our borders or global. At present, the United States has one of the safest food-safety systems in place.

The infectious virus particles, or virions, are composed of proteins and are surrounded in some species of viruses by a lipid membrane, which is referred to as an envelope; the particles contain only one kind of nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA. Viruses do not reproduce by division, such as bacteria, yeasts or other cells, but they replicate in the living cells that they infect. In them, they develop their genomic activity and produce the components from which they are made. They encode neither their own protein synthesis machinery (ribosomes) nor energy-generating metabolic pathways. Therefore, viruses are intracellular parasites. They are able to re-route and modify the course of cellular processes for the optimal execution of their own reproduction. Besides the genetic information encoding their structural components, they additionally possess genes that code for several regulatory active proteins (such as transactivators) and enzymes (e.g. proteases and polymerases).","Modrow, Susanne; Falke, Dietrich; Truyen, Uwe; Schätzl, Hermann",Molecular Virology,169,1

We theorize that the diffusion of particular content on Twitter can be driven by a sequence of nouns, adjectives, adverbs forming a sentence. We exhibit that the proposed approach is coherent with the intrinsic disposition of tweets to a common choice of words while constructing a sentence to express an opinion or sentiment. Through this paper, we propose a Custom Weighted Word Embedding (CWWE) to study the degree of diffusion of content (retweet on Twitter). Our framework first extracts the words, create a matrix of these words using the sequences in the tweet text. To this sequence matrix we further multiply custom weights basis the presence index in a sentence wherein higher weights are given if the impactful class of tokens/words like nouns, adjectives are used at the beginning of the sentence than at last. We then try to predict the possibility of diffusion of information using Long-Short Term Memory Deep Neural Network architecture, which in turn is further optimized on the accuracy and training execution time by a Convolutional Neural Network architecture. The results of the proposed CWWE are compared to a pre-trained glove word embedding. For experimentation, we created a corpus of size 230,000 tweets posted by more than 45,000 users in 6 months. Research experimentations reveal that using the proposed framework of Custom Weighted Word Embedding (CWWE) from the tweet there is a significant improvement in the overall accuracy of Deep Learning framework model in predicting information diffusion through tweets.","Kushwaha, Amit Kumar; Kar, Arpan Kumar; Vigneswara Ilavarasan, P.","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",169,1

The captive population has since grown to around 200 animals because of a combined increase in importation plus captive births. From 1982 to 1986, the captive birth rate declined by 50%, primarily because of a low frequency of breeding individuals in the population. The 1986 population had an effective breeding size of 28.1 in a total population of over 193 cheetahs. The incidence of infant mortality has been high (36.7%) relative to other zoo‐bred species, perhaps as a consequence of the previously observed genetic impoverishment of the species. The combination of low fecundity, high infant mortality, and population dynamics indicates that the North American captive cheetah population is neither a self‐sustaining nor a theoretically “viable population” as defined by Soule et al.

Paleoenvironmental reconstruction based on geomorphology, alluvial sedimentology, and diatom evidence indicates a dry phase of reduced streamflow between ca. 6700 and 4800 cal. yr B.P. for the Las Pitas River, and 6600 and 3000 cal. yr B.P. for the Miriguaca River. A phase of more humid environmental conditions commenced after ca. 4900 cal. yr B.P. along the Las Pitas River, and after 3000 cal. yr B.P. along the Miriguaca River. Differences in the chronology and magnitude of hydrological changes along both rivers are related to topographic and hydrological characteristics of their respective watersheds. Higher catchment elevation and enhanced orographic precipitation favored greater sensitivity for the Las Pitas River to short humid events during the middle‐to‐late Holocene. The archaeological evidence suggests that the paleohydrological changes within these catchments played a significant role in human occupational dynamics such that the Las Pitas River offered better environmental conditions for human occupation relative to the Miriguaca River as foragers increasingly relied on plant and animal domestication.","Grana, Lorena; Tchilinguirian, Pablo; Hocsman, Salomón; Escola, Patricia; Maidana, Nora I.",Geoarchaeology,169,1

MBL and ficolins circulate in complexes with MBL‐associated serine proteases (MASP‐1, ‐2 and ‐3). After recognition of a microorganism by MBL, activation of the complement system occurs. MASP‐1 and MASP‐3 share five domains (making up the so‐called A‐chain), whereas they have unique protease domains (B‐chains). Before the identification of MASP‐3, an assay for MASP was presented, based on antibodies against the A‐chain of MASP‐1. With the new knowledge of the three MASPs, and the sharing of domains by MASP‐1 and MASP‐3, assays specific for the protease domains have to be constructed, if one wishes to measure the proteins individually. We present an assay for quantifying total MASP‐3 in plasma and serum samples. The assay is a sandwich‐type assay using as catching antibody a monoclonal antibody against the common A‐chain of MASP‐1/3 and a developing secondary antibody against the C‐terminal part of the protease domain of MASP‐3. We have used this assay for estimating the normal concentration of the protein as well as the concentration in patients and also for characterizing by gel permeation chromatography the MASP‐3 protein in serum.","Holmvad, S.

The supercharged proteins were known as powerful weapons for delivery of different types of cargoes such as DNA and protein. Hence, we applied B1 protein with + 43 net charges obtained from a single frameshift in the gene encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) for delivery of two multi-epitope DNA constructs (nef-vpu-gp160-p24 and nef-vif-gp160-p24) in vitro and in vivo for the first time. For this purpose, B1 protein was generated in bacterial expression system under native conditions, and used to interact with both DNA constructs. RESULTS: Our data indicated that B1 protein (~ 27 kDa) was able to form a stable nanoparticle (~ 80–110 nm) with both DNA constructs at nitrogen: phosphate (N: P) ratio of 1:1. Moreover, the transfection efficiency of B1 protein for DNA delivery into HEK-293T cell line indicated that the cellular uptake of nef-vif-gp160-p24 DNA/ B1 and nef-vpu-gp160-p24 DNA/ B1 nanoparticles was about 32–35% with lower intensity as compared to TurboFect commercial reagent. On the other hand, immunization of BALB/c mice with different modalities demonstrated that B1 protein could enhance the levels of antibody, IFN-gamma and Granzyme B eliciting potent and strong Th1-directed cellular immunity. CONCLUSION: Generally, our findings showed the potency of B1 protein as a promising gene delivery system to improve an effective therapeutic vaccine against HIV-1 infection.","Kardani, Kimia; Bolhassani, Azam; Agi, Elnaz; Hashemi, Atieh",Biotechnol Lett,169,1

Since then, lockdown heavily restricts travel movements of flights, rail, intercity bus services besides industrial activity halt throughout the country. The significant improvement in the air quality of Delhi region was observed due to strict implementation of lockdown. During the lockdown period, improvement in ambient air quality helped us in circumventing the coronavirus community spread. The preliminary results showing the decrease in horizontal advection of pollutants has given an opportunity to understand the background concentrations of air pollutants over Delhi. To analyse this peculiar situation, we have assessed the pollutants datasets collected by twelve different online ambient air quality monitoring stations (AQMS) of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), New Delhi, India and observed a colossal improvement in the ambient air quality. The analysis of data confirms the sharp decline in concentrations (nearly 200%) of PM(2.5) and PM(10). The concentration of nitrous oxides (NO(x)), recorded its maximum (342 ppb) on 12 January 2020 in CRRI–Mathura Road, Delhi with the lowest value as 24 ppb on 30 March 2020 (reduced to nearly 14 times of the peak value).

In either of these situations, robots or automation agents can have distinct characteristics in their performance, much like human agents. Hence, the execution of an automated task may require adaptations with human participants executing the task when robots fail, to taking a supervisory role or having no involvement. In this paper, we consider different levels of automation, and the corresponding coordination required by resources that include human participants and robots. We capture resource characteristics and define business process constraints that support process adaptations with human-automation coordination. We then use a real-world business process and incorporate automation agents, compute resource characteristics, and use resource-aware constraints to illustrate resource-based process adaptations for its automation.","Sindhgatta, Renuka; ter Hofstede, Arthur H.

The optimal arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) levels for managing patients following OHCA are unknown. We hypothesized that abnormalities in arterial oxygenation (PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio or PaO(2)) and PaCO(2) would be associated with hospital mortality following OHCA. We hypothesized that PaCO(2) would significantly modify the oxygenation–mortality relationship. METHODS: This was an observational cohort study using data from OHCA survivors admitted to adult critical care units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 2011 to 2018. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between hospital mortality and oxygenation and PaCO(2). RESULTS: The analysis included 23,625 patients. In comparison with patients with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) > 300 mmHg, those with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ≤ 100 mmHg had higher mortality (adjusted OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.15; P < 0.001). In comparison to hyperoxemia (PaO(2) > 100 mmHg), patients with hypoxemia (PaO(2) < 60 mmHg) had higher mortality (adjusted OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.65; P = 0.004). In comparison with normocapnia, hypercapnia was associated with lower mortality. Hypocapnia (PaCO2 ≤ 35 mmHg) was associated with higher mortality (adjusted OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.63 to 2.24; P < 0.001). PaCO(2) modified the PaO(2)/FiO(2)–mortality and PaO(2)–mortality relationships, though these relationships were complex. Patients who were both hyperoxic and hypercapnic had the lowest mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Low PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, hypoxemia and hypocapnia are associated with higher mortality following OHCA. PaCO(2) modifies the relationship between oxygenation and mortality following OHCA; future studies examining this interaction are required.","McGuigan, Peter J.; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Harrison, David A.; Laffey, John G.; McAuley, Danny F.",Crit Care,169,1

Usually, pooling operators in deep learning models use an explicit topological organization, which is not always possible to obtain on multi-label data. In a previous paper, we proposed a pooling architecture based on association to deal with this issue. The association was defined by means of Pearson’s correlation. However, features must exhibit a certain degree of correlation with each other, which might not hold in all situations. In this paper, we propose a new method that replaces the correlation measure with another one that computes the entropy in the information granules that are generated from two features or labels. Numerical simulations have shown that our proposal is superior in those datasets with low correlation. This means that it induces a significant reduction in the number of parameters of neural networks, without affecting their accuracy.","Bello, Marilyn; Nápoles, Gonzalo; Sánchez, Ricardo; Vanhoof, Koen; Bello, Rafael",Rough Sets,169,20

Sodium azulene sulfonate is clinically used as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of pharyngitis as well as other inflammatory diseases such as tonsillitis, stomatitis and conjunctivitis. There has been no documentation on the effect of sodium azulene sulfonate on pharyngitis in laboratory models, probably because of no availability of such models. We recently established a pharyngitis model using capsaicin application on pharyngeal mucosa in rats. The present study investigated the antipharyngitis activity of sodium azulene sulfonate comparing with those of ruthenium red (vanilloid receptor antagonist, 8.5 and 85 mg/ml), ascorbic acid (antioxidative compound, 100 μg/ml), povidone iodine (gargle as disinfectant, oxidative compound, 5 and 20 mg/ml) and diclofenac sodium (cyclooxygenase inhibitor, 0.1 and 1 mg/ml). As an antipharyngeal effect, the capsaicin‐induced plasma exudation in the pharyngeal mucosa of the rat was evaluated. The capsaicin‐induced plasma exudation in the pharyngeal mucosa was inhibited by sodium azulene sulfonate (100 and 200 μg/ml) as well as ruthenium red and ascorbic acid, but not by povidone iodine and dicrofenac sodium; povidone iodine rather promoted the plasma exudation. In conclusion, the antipharyngitis effect of sodium azulene sulfonate was demonstrated for the first time in a laboratory model. Although the mechanism by which sodium azulene sulfonate inhibited the capsaicin‐induced pharyngitis is not yet unraveled, antioxidative effect, but not inhibitory effect on cyclooxygenase pathway, might be involved.","Sakai, Hiroyasu; Misawa, Miwa",Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,169,1

We assess the effect of the Portuguese external debt for the 1999–2019 period. Portugal had the highest net external debt among the founding members of the euro area. External debt was the main component of the international investment position. We split external debt between public and private sectors due to the different conditions that exist when accessing external funding. Additionally, we use quarterly data and estimate how external debt determined variations in the channels of transmission through which external debt may affect economic growth. Only some channels were significantly affected by external debt: the private and public external debt increased public investment, and private external debt damaged private investment. Therefore, external debt was not allocated to positively and significantly increase economic growth. Additionally, financial integration in the euro area and financial stress in Europe affected some channels of transmission. It would be advisable to reduce external debt through a positive current account, to assign external debt to tradable sectors that will obtain a higher return on investments, and to shift external funding from debt instruments to equity ones.","Silva, Jorge",Eurasian Econ Rev,169,1

This investigator driven study will include 1500 HFrEF patients and test in a 2 x 2 factorial design: 1) if hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate reduces the incidence of death and hospitalization with worsening heart failure vs. placebo (H-HeFT) and 2) if metformin reduces the incidence of death, worsening heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke vs. placebo in patients with diabetes or prediabetes (Met-HeFT). METHODS: Symptomatic, optimally treated HFrEF patients with LVEF ≤40% are randomized to active vs. placebo treatment. Patients can be randomized in either both H-HeFT and Met-HeFT or to only one of these study arms. In this event-driven study, it is anticipated that 1300 patients should be included in H-HeFT and 1100 in Met-HeFT and followed for an average of 4 years. RESULTS: As of May 2020, 296 patients have been randomized at 20 centers in Denmark. CONCLUSION: The H-HeFT and Met-HeFT studies will yield new knowledge about the potential benefit and safety of two commonly prescribed drugs with limited randomized data in patients with HFrEF.","Wiggers, Henrik; Køber, Lars; Gislason, Gunnar; Schou, Morten; Poulsen, Mikael Kjær; Vraa, Søren; Nielsen, Olav Wendelbo; Bruun, Niels Eske; Nørrelund, Helene; Hollingdal, Malene; Barasa, Anders; Bøttcher, Morten; Dodt, Karen; Hansen, Vibeke Brogaard; Nielsen, Gitte; Knudsen, Anne Sejr; Lomholdt, Jens; Mikkelsen, Kirsten Vilain; Jonczy, Bartlomiej; Brønnum-Schou, Jens; Poenaru, Monica Petronela; Abdulla, Jawdat; Raymond, Ilan; Mahboubi, Kiomars; Sillesen, Karen; Serup-Hansen, Kristine; Madsen, Jette Sandberg; Kristensen, Søren Lund; Larsen, Anders Hostrup; Bøtker, Hans Erik; Torp-Petersen, Christian; Eiskjær, Hans; Møller, Jacob; Hassager, Christian; Steffensen, Flemming Hald; Bibby, Bo Martin; Refsgaard, Jens; Høfsten, Dan Eik; Mellemkjær, Søren; Gustafsson, Finn",Am Heart J,169,1

Studies with proteomics applications, relating to Leishmaniasis, are being constantly reported in the literature. However, from such studies, a readily accessible knowledge of differentially modulated proteins associated with Leishmaniasis is lacking. Hence, we performed a systematic review concerning differentially modulated proteins (DMP) in Leishmania as well as host infected with Leishmania from the published articles between the years 2000 and 2019. This review is classified into five different sections, namely, DMP in the host after Leishmania infection, DMP between different strains of Leishmania, DMP in drug-resistant Leishmania, DMP in Leishmania under stress, and DMP in different life stages of Leishmania. A lot of consensuses could be observed among the DMP in drug-resistant and stressed Leishmania. In addition to the review, a database was constructed with the data collected in this study (protein accession ID, protein name, gene name, host organism, experimental conditions, fold change, and regulatory data). A total of 2635 records are available in the database. We believe this review and the database will help the researcher in understanding the disease better and provide information for the targeted proteomics study related to Leishmaniasis.

METHODS: An international consensus panel was convened including 29 clinician-scientists in intensive care medicine with expertise in acute respiratory failure, neurointensive care, or both, and two non-voting methodologists. The panel was divided into seven subgroups, each addressing a predefined clinical practice domain relevant to patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with ABI, defined as acute traumatic brain or cerebrovascular injury. The panel conducted systematic searches and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method was used to evaluate evidence and formulate questions. A modified Delphi process was implemented with four rounds of voting in which panellists were asked to respond to questions (rounds 1–3) and then recommendation statements (final round). Strong recommendation, weak recommendation, or no recommendation were defined when > 85%, 75–85%, and < 75% of panellists, respectively, agreed with a statement. RESULTS: The GRADE rating was low, very low, or absent across domains. The consensus produced 36 statements (19 strong recommendations, 6 weak recommendations, 11 no recommendation) regarding airway management, non-invasive respiratory support, strategies for mechanical ventilation, rescue interventions for respiratory failure, ventilator liberation, and tracheostomy in brain-injured patients. Several knowledge gaps were identified to inform future research efforts. CONCLUSIONS: This consensus provides guidance for the care of patients admitted to the ICU with ABI. Evidence was generally insufficient or lacking, and research is needed to demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of different management approaches.

One looming possibility is an onrush of austerity, deep cuts to public education, financial hardship for the working and middle classes, and a range of private sector, including online answers to public problems in education, leading to more inequity, and an even wider digital divide. The pandemic, it is argued, is already being used as a strategy to bring about educational privatization by stealth by mismanaging return-to-school strategies and by overselling the effectiveness of online and private school alternatives. The alternative is public education investment to pursue prosperity and better quality of life for everyone. This will reduce inequality instead of increasing it, close the digital divide that COVID-19 has exposed, and encourage balanced technology use to enhance good teaching rather than hybrid or blended technology delivery that may increasingly replace such teaching.","Hargreaves, Andy",Educ Res Policy Prac,169,1

Discussion: Erythema multiforme were reported in some patients with COVID-19. Its pathophysiology is not yet completely understood, but it seems there is a lymphocyte-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to SARS-CoV-2 antigens presenting in the skin.

This chapter is an examination of how local content policies have been approached in Norway and Brazil, and what lessons can be drawn for emerging oil and gas producers like Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The chapter undertakes a comparative case study approach between Norway and Brazil, analyzing the nature of the oil and gas industry and the local content model adopted.

We present a generalization of automated cost analysis that can handle abstract programs and, hence, can analyze the impact on the cost of program transformations. This kind of relational property requires provably precise cost bounds which are not always produced by cost analysis. Therefore, we certify by deductive verification that the inferred abstract cost bounds are correct and sufficiently precise. It is the first approach solving this problem. Both, abstract cost analysis and certification, are based on quantitative abstract execution (QAE) which in turn is a variation of abstract execution, a recently developed symbolic execution technique for abstract programs. To realize QAE the new concept of a cost invariant is introduced. QAE is implemented and runs fully automatically on a benchmark set consisting of representative optimization rules.","Albert, Elvira; Hähnle, Reiner; Merayo, Alicia; Steinhöfel, Dominic",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,169,1

Using a unique data set of new rental listings gathered from Craigslist and localized measures of the pandemic’s severity we find that, from mid-March to early June, local spread of COVID-19 is followed by reduced median and mean rent. However, this trend is driven by dropping rents for listings in Black, Latino, and diverse neighborhoods. Listings in majority White neighborhoods experience rent increases during this time. Our analyses make multiple contributions. First, we add to the burgeoning literature examining the rental market as a key site of perpetuating sociospatial inequality. Second, we demonstrate the utility of data gathered online for analyzing housing. And third, by reflecting on research that shows how past crises have increased sociospatial inequality and up-to-date work showing the racially and spatially unequal effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we discuss some possible mechanisms by which the pandemic may be affecting the market for rental housing as well as implications for long-term trends.","Kuk, John; Schachter, Ariela; Faber, Jacob William; Besbris, Max",Am Behav Sci,169,1

Several patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) treated with biologics had to go to the hospital to perform intravenous (i.v.) therapies, whereas patients treated with subcutaneous (s.c.) ones could remain at home. Since immumodulatory therapies as well as the access to high-risk places like hopitals have been associated to an increased risk of infections, we have investigated whether patients hospitalized or treated at home showed similar levels of anxiety related to the pandemic situation. METHODS: We conducted a survey including consecutive IBD patients treated with biologics at three Italian referral centers referring to the first lockdown period. We included consecutive adult patients in clinical and biochemical remission treated with biologics, administered i.v. or s.c. Patients experiencing a disease flare during these months were excluded from the study, in order to avoid potential biases related to disease activity. Patients underwent the normally scheduled clinical visits, performed at home by using phone or video calls for patients treated with s.c. drugs and only in specific cases (i.e. suspected COVID symptoms) for patients treated with i.v. ones. We administered to all patients the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire and other 11 questions, specifically related to COVID and its implications. Group differences in continuous and nominal variables were tested by Kruskal–Wallis test and Fisher exact test, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 189 IBD patients were recruited, 112 (59.3%) treated with i.v. drugs and 77 (40.7%) with s.c. ones. The two groups of patients had similar scores in the 14 single items of the HADS questionnaire (p>0.10 for all). The total HADS score obtained by the sum of all items was also almost identical between groups (37.1 ± 2.8 vs 37.2 ± 2.8; p=0.98). In patients treated with i.v. drugs receiving a televisit (n=17), the rates of satisfaction about telemedicine (58.8%) and the lack of in-person care (33.3%) were significantly lower compared with those treated with s.c. drugs (94.8% and 92.2%, respectively; both p<0.0005). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that there is no need to convert patients from i.v. to s.c. therapy, since the risk of infection as well as of disease relapse due to stressful events are similar in both groups. Moreover, the hospitalization for drug administration does not affect the the psychological status of the patients. Interestingly, patients used to coming to the hospital have more need for in-person contact than patients used to be treated at home, suggesting that the choice of telemedicine should be personalized.","Bertani, L; Barberio, B; Zanzi, F; Maniero, D; Ceccarelli, L; Marsilio, I; Minciotti, M; Coppini, F; Lorenzon, G; Mumolo, M G; Zingone, F; Costa, F; Savarino, E V",J Crohns Colitis,169,17

Despite the chaos, much of our civilization continued to function, thanks to contemporary information and communication technologies. In education, this situation required instructors and students to abandon the traditional face‐to‐face lectures and move to a fully online learning environment. Such a transition is challenging, both for the teacher tasked with creating digital educational content, and the student who needs to study in a new and isolated working environment. As educators, we have experienced these challenges when migrating our university courses to an online environment. Through this paper, we look to assist educators with building and running an online course. Before we needed to transition online, we researched and followed the best practices to establish various digital educational elements in our online classroom. We present these elements, along with guidance regarding their development and use. Next, we designed an empirical study consisting of two surveys, focus group discussions, and observations to understand the factors that influenced students' engagement with our online classroom. We used the same study to evaluate students' perceptions regarding our digital educational elements. We report the findings and define a set of recommendations from these results to help educators motivate their students and develop engaging digital educational content. Although our research is motivated by the pandemic, our findings and contributions are useful to all educators looking to establish some form of online learning. This includes developers of massive open online courses and teachers promoting blended learning in their classrooms.","Luburić, Nikola; Slivka, Jelena; Sladić, Goran; Milosavljević, Gordana",,169,1

Insulin resistance (IR) has been linked to inflammatory states. The aim of this study was to determine whether IR is increased in a cohort of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with low disease activity. We additionally intended to establish which factors were the determinants of IR in this population, including the presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods. Cross-sectional study encompassing 151 IBD patients and 174 non-diabetic controls. Insulin and C-peptide serum levels and IR and beta cell function (%B) indices based on homoeostatic model assessment (HOMA2) were assessed in patients and controls. Liver stiffness as measured by transient elastography, and the presence of NAFLD detected via ultrasound were additionally assessed. A multivariable regression analysis was performed to evaluate the differences in IR indexes between patients and controls, and to determine which predictor factors were associated with IR in IBD patients. Results. Neither HOMA2-IR (beta coef. −0.26 {95%CI −0.64–0.13}, p = 0.19) nor HOMA2-%B (beta coef. 15 {95%CI −14–44}, p = 0.31) indexes differed between patients and controls after fully multivariable analysis. Among classic IR risk factors, obesity, abdominal circumference, and triglycerides significantly and positively correlated with IR indexes in IBD patients. However, most features related to IBD, such as disease patterns, disease activity, and inflammatory markers, were not associated with IR. The presence of NAFLD was independently and significantly associated with beta cell dysfunction in patients with IBD (HOMA2—B grade 4, 251 ± 40 vs. grade 1, 107 ± 37, p = <0.001). Conclusions. IR is not increased in IBD patients with low disease activity compared to controls. However, the presence of NAFLD favors the development of IR in patients with IBD.","Carrillo-Palau, Marta; Hernández-Camba, Alejandro; Hernández Alvarez-Buylla, Noemi; Ramos, Laura; Alonso-Abreu, Inmaculada; Hernández-Pérez, Anjara; Vela, Milagros; Arranz, Laura; Hernández-Guerra, Manuel; González-Gay, Miguel Á.; Ferraz-Amaro, Iván",J Clin Med,169,1

However, the effect of TIC on caregivers themselves is uncertain. Even less is known about the relationship between TIC and the well-being of teachers and school staff. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between exposure to criminal victimization (a known predictor of stress), attitudes toward TIC, and perceived stress among a sample of public school teachers and staff members (N = 396). In line with our predictions, increased victimization was associated with increased perceived stress whereas TIC-favorable attitudes were associated with decreased perceived stress.

An important aspect in this process in many countries is the provision of administrative data as Open Government Data (OGD), since public organisations often produce and collect large amounts of data and are required to follow high standards of transparency at the same time. Increasingly, however, the question arises how OGD can have a positive impact on the common good beyond transparency and how this could be promoted. In this discursive article, we therefore look at the prerequisites and success factors for generating impact through OGD in three steps. First, we discuss how OGD can be optimally published so that they can easily be found, read and processed. Second, we discuss what impact means in relation to OGD, which types of impact can be distinguished and which mechanisms potentially lead to such effects. Third, we focus specifically on the instrument of innovation contests, such as hackathons, as a possible key to success. Since public organisations are participating more and more in such events, we provide some specific recommendations for preparing and participating in these somewhat special competitions before drawing a conclusion.","Neumann, Oliver; Mettler, Tobias",HMD,169,22

Although they are very popular, so far, these elements provide a limited range of services that are mostly focused on monitoring tasks such as fitness, activity, or health tracking. Besides, given their hardware and power constraints, wearable units are dependent on a master device, e.g., a smartphone, to make decisions or send the collected data to the cloud. However, a new wave of both communication and artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies fuels the evolution of wearables to an upper level. Concretely, they are the low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) and tiny machine-learning (TinyML) technologies. This paper reviews and discusses these solutions, and explores the major implications and challenges of this technological transformation. Finally, the results of an experimental study are presented, analyzing (i) the long-range connectivity gained by a wearable device in a university campus scenario, thanks to the integration of LPWAN communications, and (ii) how complex the intelligence embedded in this wearable unit can be. This study shows the interesting characteristics brought by these state-of-the-art paradigms, concluding that a wide variety of novel services and applications will be supported by the next generation of wearables.","Sanchez-Iborra, Ramon",Sensors (Basel),169,0

Nevertheless, several challenges in integrating ICT into the curriculum have been reported in previous research, especially in studies on Sub-Saharan African countries. Focusing on the case of Kenyan public primary schools, this study investigated the availability of ICT facilities; teacher capacity to integrate technology into their lessons; and teacher perceptions towards technology in schools. In particular, the study is premised on the constructivist learning theory and the Technology Acceptance Model. A total of 351 teachers completed an online questionnaire. Teachers perceived that ICT facilities were inadequate in schools, which presented a challenge in the integration of technology during the implementation of the new curriculum. Most of the teachers answered that they received only basic computer literacy training. Although teachers perceived the use of computers as necessary, they faced difficulties integrating technology in their lessons. The effect of age and gender on teacher capacity was also investigated in inferential statistics, specifically with Welch tests and Games-Howell post hoc comparisons.

METHODS In this case-control study, n = 36 patients with a preoperative mechanical tibiofemoral angle (mTFA) ≥ 15° who underwent TKA between December 2002 and December 2012 were included. The control group (mTFA < 15°) of n = 60 patients was created using case matching. Radiological [mechanical tibiofemoral angle (mTFA) and ankle joint orientation to the ground (G-AJLO)] and clinical parameters [Foot Function Index (FFI), Knee Society Score, Forgotten Joint Score, and Range of Motion (ROM)] were analysed. The mean follow-up time was 59 months (IQR [56, 62]). RESULTS The degree of correcting the mTFA by TKA significantly correlated with the postoperative FFI (R = 0.95, p < 0.05), although the knee and ankle joint lines were corrected to neutral orientations. A cut-off value of 16.5° [AUC 0.912 (0.85-0.975 95% CI), sensitivity = 0.8, specificity = 0.895] was calculated, above which the odds ratio (OR) for developing ankle symptoms increased vastly [OR 34.0 (9.10-127.02 95% CI)]. ROM restrictions of the subtalar joint displayed a strong significant correlation with the FFI (R = 0.74, p < 0.05), demonstrating that decreased ROM of the subtalar joint was associated with aggravated outcomes of the ankle joint. CONCLUSIONS In this study, higher degrees of leg axis correction in TKA were associated with increased postoperative ankle symptoms. When TKA is performed in excessive valgus knee osteoarthritis, surgeons should be aware that this might trigger the onset or progression of ankle symptoms, particularly in cases of a stiff subtalar joint.

METHODS IBD patients initiating vedolizumab or ustekinumab in regular care were enrolled prospectively. Comorbidity prevalence was assessed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Association between age and CCI, both continuously assessed, with safety outcomes (any infection, hospitalisation, adverse events) during treatment, and effectiveness outcomes (clinical response and remission, corticosteroid-free remission, clinical remission combined with biochemical remission) after 52 weeks of treatment were evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for confounders. RESULTS We included 203 vedolizumab- and 207 ustekinumab-treated IBD patients, mean age 42.2 (SD 16.0) and 41.6 (SD 14.4). Median treatment duration 54.0 (IQR 19.9-104.0) and 48.4 (IQR 24.4-55.1) weeks, median follow-up time 104.0 (IQR 103.1-104.0) and 52.0 weeks (IQR 49.3-100.4).

Our results showed that movement-related pain modulates corticospinal excitability during motor preparation. In accordance with the pain adaptation theory, corticospinal excitability was higher when the muscle has an antagonist (vs. an agonist) role for the upcoming movement associated with pain. Anticipation of movement-related pain also affects motor initiation and execution, with slower movement initiation (longer reaction times) and faster movement execution compared to movements that do not evoke pain. These results confirm the implementation of protective strategies during motor preparation known to be relevant for acute pain, but which may potentially have detrimental long-term consequences and lead to the development of chronic pain. ABSTRACT When a movement repeatedly generates pain, we anticipate movement-related pain and establish self-protective strategies during motor preparation, but the underlying mechanisms remains poorly understood. The current study investigated the effect of movement-related pain anticipation on the modulation of behaviour and corticospinal excitability during the preparation of arm movements. Participants completed an instructed-delay reaction-time (RT) task consisting of elbow flexions and extensions instructed by visual cues. Nociceptive laser stimulations (unconditioned stimuli) were applied to the lateral epicondyle during movement execution in a specific direction (CS+) but not in the other (CS-), depending on experimental group. During motor preparation, transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to measure corticospinal excitability in the biceps brachii (BB). RT and peak end-point velocity were also measured. Neurophysiological results revealed an opposite modulation of corticospinal excitability in BB depending on whether it plays an agonist (i.e. flexion) or antagonist (i.e. extension) role for the CS+ movements (P < 0.001). Moreover, behavioural results showed that for the CS+ movements RT did not change relative to baseline, whereas the CS- movements were initiated more quickly (P = 0.023) and the CS+ flexion movements were faster relative to the CS- flexion movements (P < 0.001). This is consistent with the pain adaptation theory which proposes that in order to protect the body from further pain, agonist muscle activity is reduced and antagonist muscle activity is increased. If these strategies are initially relevant and lead to short-term pain alleviation, they may potentially have detrimental long-term consequences and lead to the development of chronic pain.","Neige, Cécilia; Mavromatis, Nicolas; Gagné, Martin; Bouyer, Laurent J; Mercier, Catherine",The Journal of physiology,169,23

We here used neuroimaging in humans to investigate this neural competition by lateralized stimulations with other speech samples and ipsilateral or contralateral lateralized feedback of actively produced self speech utterances in the form of various speech vowels. In experiment 1, we show, first, that others' speech classifications during active self speech lead to activity in the planum temporale (Pte) when both self and other speech samples were presented together to only the left or right ear. The contralateral PTe also seemed to indifferently respond to single self and other speech samples. Second, specific activity in the left anterior superior temporal cortex (STC) was found during dichotic stimulations (i.e. self and other speech presented to separate ears). Unlike previous studies, this left anterior STC activity supported self speech rather than other speech processing. Furthermore, right mid and anterior STC was more involved in other speech processing. These results signify specific mechanisms for self and other speech processing in the left and right STC beyond a more general speech processing in PTe. Third, other speech recognition in the context of listening to recorded self speech in experiment 2 led to largely symmetric activity in STC and additionally in inferior frontal subregions. The latter was previously reported to be generally relevant for other speech perception and classification, but we found frontal activity only when other speech classification was challenged by recorded but not by active self speech samples. Altogether, unlike formerly established brain networks for uncompetitive other speech perception, active self speech during other speech perception seemingly leads to a neural reordering, functional reassignment, and unusual lateralization of AC and frontal brain activations.","Dietziker, Joris; Staib, Matthias; Frühholz, Sascha",NeuroImage,169,1

DESIGN Rapid online survey. Participants completed a series of online questionnaires regarding hearing ability, socialisation (pre- and during-pandemic), loneliness, anxiety, depression and cognitive function. STUDY SAMPLE A total of 80 participants over the age of 70 with access to the internet. RESULTS There was a significant reduction in socialisation levels from pre-pandemic in this population. Hearing difficulties were significantly associated with greater levels of loneliness, depression and self-perceived cognitive dysfunction after controlling for age, gender, and level of education. Additionally, compared to pre-pandemic, people with hearing difficulties had increased odds of reporting worsened anxiety, depression, and memory during the COVID-19 pandemic, although only the effect of hearing difficulties on the change in memory reached statistical significance after controlling for age, gender, and level of education. CONCLUSIONS The worse the self-reported hearing abilities are, the greater the negative impact of enforced social distancing on depression, loneliness and cognitive function.","Littlejohn, Jenna; Venneri, Annalena; Marsden, Antonia; Plack, Christopher J",International journal of audiology,169,24

The aim of this study was to determine frequency and clinical influence of viral respiratory viruses as potential etiologic agents in episodes of FN in children. A total of 100 children (62 boys, 38 girls) with 166 FN episodes were included in this prospective study. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were analyzed for respiratory viral agents using multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. The origin of the fever could be defined in 111 (67%) of the episodes. We detected viral agents in 86 (51.8%), bacterial agents in 19 (11.4%), and fungal agents in 5 (3%) of the episodes. The most common detected viruses were rhinovirus (n= 27), respiratory syncytial virus (n=17), and coronavirus (n=16). Parainfluenza virus, influenza A and B, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus, bocavirus and parechovirus were the remaining detected agents. More than one virus positivity occurred in 13 FN episodes. Forty-three patients had multiple FN episodes. Only four patients had the same viral agent in consecutive attacks. Respiratory symptoms (cough, nasal discharge and congestion, sneezing, wheezing), physical examination signs (rales and rhonchi) and radiological findings were significantly more common in viral agent positive patients (p < 0.05). This study showed that respiratory viruses make a substantial contribution on the etiology of FN episodes in children. Identifying viral agents may help to constitute individualized infection-management algorithms in these patients.","Aldemir-Kocabaş, Bilge; Karbuz, Adem; Pekpak, Esra; Karahan, Zeynep Ceren; Dolapçı, İştar; İnce, Elif; Uysal, Zümrüt; Yavuz, Gülsan; Çiftçi, Ergin; İnce, Erdal",The Turkish journal of pediatrics,169,16

Traditionally, 4 to 6 trocars are used. Single-access surgery has emerged as an attempt to decrease incisional morbidity and enhance cosmetic benefits. We present our initial 7 patients undergoing single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy using a novel technique for liver retraction. METHODS Patients who underwent single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy between March 2009 and May 2009 were analyzed. A 4-cm left paramedian incision was used. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was performed in a standard fashion using a 40 French bougie. RESULTS Seven patients underwent single-incision sleeve gastrectomy at the University of Illinois at Chicago. They were all female with a mean age of 34 years. Preoperative BMI was 49 kg/m² (range, 39 to 64). There were no intraoperative complications. Mean operative time was 103 minutes. Estimated blood loss was minimal. All 7 patients were discharged on postoperative day 2 and were doing well without any complications at 3.1 ± 0.7 months after surgery. CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is safe and feasible and can be performed without changing the existing principles of the procedure. Our technique for internal liver retraction provides adequate exposure and is reproducible. Development of improved standard instrumentation is required for this technique to become popular.","Galvani, Carlos A; Choh, Mark; Gorodner, Maria V",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,169,27

It has become the go-to methodology for tackling image restoration and has outperformed the traditional non-local class of methods. However, the top-performing networks are generally composed of many convolutional layers and hundreds of neurons, with trainable parameters in excess of several million. We claim that this is due to the inherently linear nature of convolution-based transformation, which is inadequate for handling severe restoration problems. Recently, a non-linear generalization of CNNs, called the operational neural networks (ONN), has been shown to outperform CNN on AWGN denoising. However, its formulation is burdened by a fixed collection of well-known non-linear operators and an exhaustive search to find the best possible configuration for a given architecture, whose efficacy is further limited by a fixed output layer operator assignment. In this study, we leverage the Taylor series-based function approximation to propose a self-organizing variant of ONNs, Self-ONNs, for image restoration, which synthesizes novel nodal transformations on-the-fly as part of the learning process, thus eliminating the need for redundant training runs for operator search. In addition, it enables a finer level of operator heterogeneity by diversifying individual connections of the receptive fields and weights. We perform a series of extensive ablation experiments across three severe image restoration tasks. Even when a strict equivalence of learnable parameters is imposed, Self-ONNs surpass CNNs by a considerable margin across all problems, improving the generalization performance by up to 3 dB in terms of PSNR.","Malik, Junaid; Kiranyaz, Serkan; Gabbouj, Moncef",Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society,169,26

Methods: A comprehensive database search was undertaken using AMED, CINAHL, CENTRAL, EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science on 12-16 June 2017, and updated 9 April 2018. Studies investigating electronic and paper-based recordings of clinical skills assessments of students in entry-level health professional programs were eligible for inclusion. Two independent researchers completed screening of studies for inclusion, quality assessments, and data extraction, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Quality assessment was performed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program Diagnostic checklist. Results: From 2264 studies identified, five observational cohort studies were included. Published between 2006 and 2016, included studies investigated electronic and paper examinations of clinical skills assessments of students from medical, dentistry, and physical therapy programs. Electronic assessments were reported to be more time efficient than paper-based assessments with an added advantage of no missing data. Quality and quantity of quantitative and qualitative student feedback increased with electronic assessment compared to paper-based assessments. Conclusions: Electronic assessments were used successfully across a range of health professional programs, take significantly less time to complete and provide higher quality feedback to students. Future studies are needed with more robust psychometric testing and cost-effective analysis to inform the increasing uptake of electronic assessment tools in health professional training.","Phillips, Anna C; Mackintosh, Shylie Fordyce; Gibbs, Carole; Ng, Leo; Fryer, Caroline Elizabeth",Medical teacher,169,8

Prior to the pandemic, adoption of telehealth by health care providers was hampered by outdated legislative and regulatory barriers at the federal and state levels. This paper provides a review of the legislative and regulatory landscape for telehealth in the United States and how it has changed during the COVID-10 PHE. It remains to be seen whether the temporary flexibilities surrounding delivery and payment of telehealth services will remain in place; some require Congressional action to make permanent while others can be made permanent through rulemaking. Other actions are dependent on state legislatures and commercial payers. Issues under debate by stakeholders include long-term audio-only coverage; broadband connectivity; disparities in access to telehealth; appropriate payment for telehealth versus in-person care; concerns about fraud, quality, and safety; and the need for additional data to inform future policymaking. Insights are provided into these key issues that are expected to shape future legislative and regulatory action at the federal and state levels.

We have investigated how these animals regulate brain temperature under heavy heat loads. Animals were instrumented for measurements of blood flow, tissue temperatures and respiratory frequency (f) under full anaesthesia, whereas measurements were also made in fully conscious animals while in a climatic chamber or running on a treadmill. At rest, brain temperature (T(brain)) rose from 38.5±0.1°C at 10°C to 39.5±0.2°C at 50°C, while f increased from ×7 to ×250 breaths min(-1), with a change to open-mouth panting (OMP) at T(brain) 39.0±0.1°C, and carotid and sublingual arterial flows increased by 160% and 500%, respectively. OMP caused jugular venous and carotid arterial temperatures to drop, presumably owing to a much increased respiratory evaporative heat loss. Angular oculi vein (AOV) flow was negligible until T(brain) reached 38.9±0.1°C, but it increased to 0.81 ml min(-1) kg(-1) at T(brain) 39.2±0.2°C. Bilateral occlusion of both AOVs induced OMP and a rise in T(brain) and f at T(brain) >38.8°C. We propose that reindeer regulate body and, particularly, brain temperature under heavy heat loads by a combination of panting, at first through the nose, but later, when the heat load and the minute volume requirements increase due to exercise, primarily through the mouth and that they eventually resort to selective brain cooling.","Blix, Arnoldus Schytte; Walløe, Lars; Folkow, Lars P",The Journal of experimental biology,169,30

METHODS US scans of the neck vasculature were collected to produce a dataset of 2439 images and their respective manual segmentations. Fourfold cross-validation was employed to train and evaluate Mask RCNN and U-Net models. The U-Net algorithm includes a post-processing step that selects the largest connected segmentation for each class. A Mask R-CNN-based vascular reconstruction pipeline was validated by performing a surface-to-surface distance comparison between US and CT reconstructions from the same patient. RESULTS The average CA and IJV Dice scores produced by the Mask R-CNN across the evaluation data from all four sets were [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. The average Dice scores produced by the post-processed U-Net were [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], for the CA and IJV, respectively. The reconstruction algorithm utilizing the Mask R-CNN was capable of producing accurate 3D reconstructions with majority of US reconstruction surface points being within 2 mm of the CT equivalent. CONCLUSIONS On average, the Mask R-CNN produced more accurate vascular segmentations compared to U-Net. The Mask R-CNN models were used to produce 3D reconstructed vasculature with a similar accuracy to that of a manually segmented CT scan. This implementation of the Mask R-CNN network enables automatic analysis of the neck vasculature and facilitates 3D vascular reconstruction.","Groves, Leah A; VanBerlo, Blake; Veinberg, Natan; Alboog, Abdulrahman; Peters, Terry M; Chen, Elvis C S",International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,169,7

Here, we analyzed symbiotic relations of Z. latifolia and U. esculenta, using a triadimefon (TDF) treatment and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). Specifically, accurately identify the whole growth cycle of Z. latifolia. Microstructure observations showed that the presence of U. esculenta could be clearly observed after gall formation but was absent after the TDF treatment. A total of 17,541 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, based on the transcriptome. According to gene ontology term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway results, plant hormone signal transduction, and cell wall-loosening factors were all significantly enriched due to U. esculenta infecting Z. latifolia; relative expression levels of hormone-related genes were identified, of which downregulation of indole 3-acetic acid (IAA)-related DEGs was most pronounced in JB_D versus JB_B. The ultra-high performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that IAA, zeatin+trans zeatin riboside, and gibberellin 3 were increased under U. esculenta infection. Based on our results, we proposed a hormone-cell wall loosening model to study the symbiotic mechanism of gall formation after U. esculenta infects Z. latifolia. Our study thus provides a new perspective for studying the physiological and molecular mechanisms of U. esculenta infection of Z. latifolia causing swollen gall formations as well as a theoretical basis for enhancing future yields of cultivated Z. latifolia.[Formula: see text] The author(s) have dedicated the work to the public domain under the Creative Commons CCO ""No Rights Reserved"" license by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law.","Li, Jie; Lu, Zhiyuan; Yang, Yang; Hou, Jinfeng; Yuan, Lingyun; Chen, Guohu; Wang, Chenggang; Jia, Shaoke; Feng, Xuming; Zhu, Shidong",Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI,169,24

AOM and respiratory viruses both display seasonal variation. Our objective was to examine the temporal association between circulating respiratory viruses and the occurrence of pediatric ambulatory care visits for AOM. METHODS This retrospective study included 9 seasons of respiratory viral activity (2002 to 2010) in Utah. We used Intermountain Healthcare electronic medical records to assess community respiratory viral activity via laboratory-based active surveillance and to identify children <18 years with outpatient visits and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes for AOM. We assessed the strength of the association between AOM and individual respiratory viruses using interrupted time series analyses. RESULTS During the study period, 96,418 respiratory viral tests were performed; 46,460 (48%) were positive. The most commonly identified viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (22%), rhinovirus (8%), influenza (8%), parainfluenza (4%), human metapneumovirus (3%) and adenovirus (3%). AOM was diagnosed during 271,268 ambulatory visits. There were significant associations between peak activity of respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A and office visits for AOM. Adenovirus, parainfluenza and rhinovirus were not associated with visits for AOM. CONCLUSIONS Seasonal respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and influenza activity were temporally associated with increased diagnoses of AOM among children. These findings support the role of individual respiratory viruses in the development AOM. These data also underscore the potential for respiratory viral vaccines to reduce the burden of AOM.","Stockmann, Chris; Ampofo, Krow; Hersh, Adam L; Carleton, Scott T; Korgenski, Kent; Sheng, Xiaoming; Pavia, Andrew T; Byington, Carrie L",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,169,1

The risk of mesh infection is increased in a contaminated environment or in patients who have comorbidities such as diabetes or smoking. The use of biological prostheses has been advocated because of their ability to resist infection. Initial results, however, have shown high hernia recurrence rates and wound occurrences. The objective of the present study is to evaluate early and mid-term outcomes in the largest French series that included 43 consecutive complex abdominal hernias repaired with biological prostheses. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective observational study of a prospective collected data bank. Patient demographics, history of previous repairs, intraoperative findings and degree of contamination, associated procedures, postoperative prosthetic-related complications, and long-term results were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS There were 25 (58%) incisional, 14 parastomal, and 4 midline hernia repairs. Hernias were considered ""clean"" (n = 5), ""clean-contaminated"" (n = 19), ""contaminated"" (n = 12), or ""dirty"" (n = 7). Wound-related morbidity occurred in 17 patients; 4 patients needed reoperation for cutaneous necrosis or abscess. Smoking was the only risk factor associated with wound complication (P = .022). No postoperative wound events required removal of the prosthesis. There were 4 hernia recurrences (9%). A previous attempt at repair (P = .018) and no complete fascia closure (P = .033) were associated with hernia recurrence. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that the use of bioprothesis in complex hernia repair allowed successful single-stage reconstruction. Wound-related complications were frequent.

Eventually, there was a considerable decrease in volunteer blood donations. Regular transfusions and follow-up of patients with thalassemia major (TM) should be maintained during this period. It is possible that the treatment of the patients with TM may hinder due to the difficulty of reaching the treatment center and the difficulty of blood supply. Thus, in this study, we aimed to investigate whether there were any differences in the follow-up and treatment of the patients with TM during the outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-one patients with TM who were followed up in our center without COVID-19 contact history and symptoms were included in this study. The demographic features and red blood cell volume per kilogram they received, pretransfusion hemoglobin, serum ferritin (SF) level, biochemical parameters, and transfusion interval were recorded. The difference between the arithmetic mean of the data before and during the pandemic was evaluated. RESULTS In this study, 61 patients with TM (32 males/29 females, mean age 13.9±6.8 y) were evaluated. The mean pretransfusion hemoglobin value was 9.14±0.77 g/dL and 8.87± 0.80 g/dL before and during the pandemic, respectively (P=0.023). There was no difference between before and during the pandemic concerning transfusion interval and transfusion volume. However, SF levels increased above 1000 ng/mL in 16.6% of patients. CONCLUSION Although blood donation decreased significantly during the pandemic, it was observed in this study that the blood needs of patients with TM could be provided. The results of the SF level showed that the management of chelation therapy should be more meticulous. However, we should be ready for the challenges in the transfusion practice of patients with TM due to fluctuations in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Oymak, Yesim; Karapinar, Tuba H",Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,169,5

Upon developing postoperative fever and shortness of breath, two patients underwent thoracic computed tomography (CT), although no characteristics indicating COVID-19 were found. The discharged patients had no COVID-19 positivity at follow-up. CONCLUSION The data that we obtained were not surgical results from patients with COVID-19 infection. They were the results from emergency surgeries on patients who were not infected with COVID-19 but were in a hospital largely dealing with the pandemic. Analysis on the cases in this study showed that both the patients with emergency surgery and the patients with COVİD infection were successfully treated, without influencing each other, through appropriate isolation measures, although managed in the same hospital. In addition, these successful results were supported by 14-day follow-up after discharge.","Bozkurt, Hilmi; Gür, Hüda Ümit; Akıncı, Muzaffer; Aslan, Hogir; Karakullukçu, Çiğdem; Yıldırım, Doğan",Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,169,1

Episodic exacerbations of dyskinesia are a particularly disturbing symptom as they occur predominantly during night and interrupt sleep. We present the clinical short- and long-term effects of pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) in three patients with a confirmed pathogenic ADCY5 mutation. Patients were implanted with bilateral pallidal DBS at the age of 34, 20 and 13 years. Medical records were reviewed for clinical history. Pre- and postoperative video files were assessed using the ""Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale"" (AIMS) as well as the motor part of the ""Burke Fahn Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale"" (BFMDRS). All patients reported subjective general improvement ranging from 40 to 60%, especially the reduction of nocturnal episodic dyskinesias (80-90%). Objective scales revealed only a mild decrease of involuntary movements in all and reduced dystonia in one patient. DBS-induced effects were sustained up to 13 years after implantation. We demonstrate that treatment with pallidal DBS was effective in reducing nocturnal dyskinetic exacerbations in patients with ADCY5-related movement disorder, which was sustained over the long term.","de Almeida Marcelino, Ana Luísa; Mainka, Tina; Krause, Patricia; Poewe, Werner; Ganos, Christos; Kühn, Andrea A",Journal of neurology,169,8

DESIGN Eligible adults were aged 18-75 years, with active moderate-to-severe CD (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) 220-450), a history of failure or intolerance to antitumour necrosis factor and/or immunosuppressive agents, high-sensitivity C reactive protein >3.0 mg/L and ulcers on colonoscopy. Patients were randomised to PF-00547659 22.5 mg, 75 mg or 225 mg or placebo. The primary endpoint was CDAI 70-point decrease from baseline (CDAI-70) at week 8 or 12. RESULTS In all, 265 patients were eligible for study entry. Although CDAI-70 response was not significantly different with placebo versus PF-00547659 treatment at weeks 8 or 12, remission rate was greater in patients with higher baseline C reactive protein (>5 mg/L vs >18.8 mg/L, respectively). Soluble MAdCAM decreased significantly from baseline to week 2 in a dose-related manner and remained low during the study in PF-00547659-treated patients. Circulating β7+ CD4+ central memory T-lymphocytes increased at weeks 8 and 12 with PF-00547659 treatment. No safety signal was seen. CONCLUSIONS Clinical endpoint differences between PF-00547659 and placebo did not reach statistical significance in patients with moderate-to-severe CD. PF-00547659 was pharmacologically active, as shown by a sustained dose-related decrease in soluble MAdCAM and a dose-related increase in circulating β7+ central memory T cells.

We hypothesize that improving patient selection using the capillary index score (CIS) may also be a useful strategy. METHODS CIS was calculated, blinded to outcome, from pretreatment diagnostic cerebral angiograms for 78 subjects in the Interventional Management of Stroke III database with internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery trunk occlusion. The CIS was dichotomized into favorable (fCIS=2 or 3) and poor (pCIS=0 or 1). Outcomes were categorized based on the modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days (0-2 considered a good outcome). Modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score 2b or 3 was considered good revascularization. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to relate CIS, time from ictus to revascularization, modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score, and National Institue of Health Stroke Scale score to good outcomes. RESULTS Only CIS and modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scores were correlated with good outcomes (P<0.01). Patients with fCIS and good revascularization achieved 71% modified Rankin Scale≤2, compared with 13% for patients with pCIS and good revascularization. CONCLUSIONS In this subset of patients from the Interventional Management of Stroke III Trial, CIS and modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction were strong predictors of outcome after endovascular reperfusion. Using the CIS to improve patient selection could be a powerful strategy to improve rate of good outcomes in endovascular therapy. A randomized trial is needed.

Pertussis or whooping cough is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable respiratory disease that resurged during the last decades in many countries. In response to the epidemiological situation, new boosters have been incorporated into vaccination schedules worldwide and new vaccine candidates have started to be designed. Particularly, our group designed a new pertussis vaccine candidate based on OMVs derived from Bordetella pertussis (BpOMVs). To continue with the characterization of the immune response induced by our OMV based vaccine candidate, this work aimed to investigate the ability of OMVs to activate the inflammasome pathway in macrophages. We observed that NLRP3, caspase-1/11, and gasdermin-D (GSDMD) are involved in inflammasome activation by BpOMVs. Moreover, we demonstrated that BpOMVs as well as transfected B. pertussis lipooligosaccharide (BpLOS) induce caspase-11 (Casp11) and guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) dependent non-canonical inflammasome activation. Our results elucidate the mechanism by which BpOMVs trigger one central pathway of the innate response activation that is expected to skew the adaptive immune response elicited by BpOMVs vaccination.","Elizagaray, Maia L; Gomes, Marco Túlio R; Guimaraes, Erika S; Rumbo, Martín; Hozbor, Daniela F; Oliveira, Sergio C; Moreno, Griselda",Frontiers in immunology,169,24

The results showed that the lower ratio of DSi to[Formula: see text] (0.044 ± 0.001) was mainly controlled by the domination of carbonate mineral in the sedimentary rock of the Yalongjiang River drainage basin. The DSi:[Formula: see text] ratio was positively correlated with discharge (P < 0.05), and negatively correlated with the water retention time (P < 0.01) and chlorophyll a, implying that the variations of DSi:[Formula: see text] ratio were mainly determined by the rock chemical weathering processes and the hydrologic process outside the reservoirs and the biological processes within the cascade reservoirs. The phytoplankton photosynthetic process stoichiometrically assimilated DSi and [Formula: see text], resulted in 3.46 × 104 t·Si a-1 and 1.89 × 104 t·C a-1 sequestering in the cascade reservoirs, respectively. Compared with the situation of dam-free in the lower reaches of Yalongjiang River, the export flux of [Formula: see text] and DSi at the mouth of Yalongjiang River was reduced by 11.87% and 62.50%, respectively; the ratio of DSi:[Formula: see text] decreased by 36.01% for only building the Ertan dam and 53.15% for the cascade damming, respectively. The water renewal time prolonged from 45 to 126.6 days due to the regulation of the cascade reservoirs in the mainstream. Ultimately, a conceptual model on migration-transformation of DIC and DSi within the cascade reservoirs in the lower reaches of Yalongjiang River was established. These findings demonstrated that riverine cascade damming could extend the biogeochemical coupling cycle of DIC and DSi within the inland aquatic ecosystems and ensure the ecological environment security in the hot-dry valley.","Deng, Haojun; Tao, Zhen; Gao, Quanzhou; Yao, Ling; Feng, Yong; Li, Yinhua; Ding, Jian; Wang, Zhengang; Lyu, Xiaoxi; Xu, Peng",Environmental science and pollution research international,169,12

DATA SOURCES Literature searches of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were conducted on April 19, 2020, to include articles written in English that reported the prevalence of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. REVIEW METHODS Search strategies developed for each database contained keywords such as anosmia, dysgeusia, and COVID-19. Resulting articles were imported into a systematic review software and underwent screening. Data from articles that met inclusion criteria were extracted and analyzed. Meta-analysis using pooled prevalence estimates in a random-effects model were calculated. RESULTS Ten studies were analyzed for olfactory dysfunction (n = 1627), demonstrating 52.73% (95% CI, 29.64%-75.23%) prevalence among patients with COVID-19. Nine studies were analyzed for gustatory dysfunction (n = 1390), demonstrating 43.93% (95% CI, 20.46%-68.95%) prevalence. Subgroup analyses were conducted for studies evaluating olfactory dysfunction using nonvalidated and validated instruments and demonstrated 36.64% (95% CI, 18.31%-57.24%) and 86.60% (95% CI, 72.95%-95.95%) prevalence, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and may represent early symptoms in the clinical course of infection. Increased awareness of this fact may encourage earlier diagnosis and treatment, as well as heighten vigilance for viral transmission. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to report on the prevalence of these symptoms in COVID-19 patients.","Tong, Jane Y; Wong, Amanda; Zhu, Daniel; Fastenberg, Judd H; Tham, Tristan",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,169,17

To improve the quality of research, this systematic review summarised the research methodology used in biomechanical studies of strongman exercises and identified potential improvements to current approaches. A search of 5 databases found 10 articles adherent to the pre-defined inclusion criteria. The studies assessed 8 strongman exercises and included male participants of relatively similar body mass but varying training backgrounds. Due to the complexity of strongman exercises and the challenges in collecting advanced biomechanical data in the field, most studies used simplified measurement/analysis methods (e.g., 2D motion capture). Future strongman biomechanical studies should: assess under/un-researched strongman exercises; include a greater number of experienced and female strongman athletes; utilise more advanced (e.g., 3D motion capture and/or inertial sensor) technology so to provide a broader range and greater quality of data. Such approaches will provide strength and conditioning coaches, strongman coaches and athletes with a greater understanding of strongman exercises, thereby further improving exercise prescription, athlete performance and minimising risk of injury.","Hindle, Benjamin R; Lorimer, Anna; Winwood, Paul; Keogh, Justin W L",Sports biomechanics,169,1

The dysregulated expression of the S100A11 gene has been implicated in tumour metastasis. However, the role of S100A11 protein in tumour cell response to chemotherapeutic drugs has not been characterised. METHODS Transcript levels of S100A11 in gastric cancer were evaluated using an in-house patient cohort. Protein expression of S100A11 in gastric cancer was estimated by immunohistochemistry of a tissue microarray. The stable gastric cancer cell lines were established using lentiviral shRNA vectors. The knockdown of S100A11 was validated by qRT-PCR, PCR, and Western blot. The cellular function of S100A11 was estimated by assays of cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. The cell cytotoxic assay was performed to investigate the response to chemotherapeutic drugs. An unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (HCPC) was applied to unveil the dimensional role of S100A11 among all S100 family members in gastric cancer. RESULTS High expression of S100A11 is associated with poor survival of gastric cancer patients (p < 0.001, HR = 1.85) and is an independent prognostic factor of gastric cancer. We demonstrate that S100A11 plays its role as a tumour promoter through regulating the MMP activity and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. The stable knockdown of S100A11 suppresses the metastatic properties of gastric cancer cells, which include enhancing cell adhesion, but decelerating cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, the knockdown of S100A11 gene expression dramatically induces the cellular response of gastric cancer cells to the first-line chemotherapeutic drugs fluoropyrimidine 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin. CONCLUSION The present study identifies S100A11 as a tumour promoter in gastric cancer. More importantly, the S100A11-specific targeting potentially presents dual therapeutic benefits by not only controlling tumour progression but also sensitising chemotherapeutic cytotoxic response.","Cui, Yuxin; Li, Liting; Li, Zhilei; Yin, Jie; Lane, Jane; Ji, Jiafu; Jiang, Wen G",Cancer cell international,169,8

Nine of ten patients have sufficient immune reconstitution to protect against serious infections, and have not needed to resume ERT or proceed to secondary allogeneic HSCT. ERT was restarted 6 months after GT in the oldest patient who had no evidence of benefit from GT. Four of nine evaluable patients with the highest gene marking and B cell numbers remain off immunoglobulin replacement therapy and responded to vaccines.

The objective of this preliminary report is to describe prehospital encounters for patients with a COVID-19 hospital diagnosis and/or COVID-19 EMS suspicion versus those with neither a hospital diagnosis nor EMS suspicion of the disease.Methods: This case series evaluated electronic patient care records from EMS agencies participating in a large national bi-directional data exchange. All records for 9-1-1 responses between March 1 and April 19, 2020, resulting in transport to a hospital, with at least one ICD-10 outcome returned via the data exchange were included. Hospital ICD-10 codes used to determine COVID-19 diagnoses included B97.2, B97.21, B97.29, B34.2, and U07.1. COVID-19 EMS suspicion was defined as a documented EMS primary or secondary impression of COVID-19, or indication of COVID-19 suspicion in the prehospital free-text narrative. Comparisons were stratified by COVID-19 hospital diagnosis and COVID-19 EMS suspicion. Descriptive and comparative statistics are presented.Results: There were 84,540 EMS patient records with linked hospital ICD-10 codes included. Of those, 814 (1%) patients had a COVID-19 hospital diagnosis. Overall, COVID-19 EMS suspicion was documented for 3,204 (4%) patients. A COVID-19 EMS suspicion was documented for 636 (78%) of hospital diagnosed COVID-19 patients. Those with COVID-19 hospital diagnoses were more likely to present with tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia, and fever during the EMS encounter. EMS responses for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were also more likely to originate from a skilled nursing/assisted living facility. EMS PPE (eye protection, mask, or gown) use was more frequently documented on records of patients who had hospital diagnosed COVID-19.Conclusion: In this large sample of prehospital encounters, EMS COVID-19 suspicion demonstrated sensitivity of 78% and positive predictive value of 20% compared with hospital ICD-10 codes. These data indicate that EMS suspicion alone is insufficient to determine appropriate utilization of PPE.","Fernandez, Antonio R; Crowe, Remle P; Bourn, Scott; Matt, Sarah E; Brown, Andrew L; Hawthorn, Andrew B; Myers, J Brent",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,169,31

The purpose of the current study was to help build a theory for how early repeating patterning knowledge contributes to early math development, focusing on development in children aged 4-6 years. The current study examined the relation between 65 preschool children's repeating patterning knowledge (via a fast, teacher-friendly measure) and their end-of-kindergarten broad math and numeracy knowledge, controlling for verbal and visual-spatial working memory (WM) skills as well as end-of-pre-K (pre-kindergarten) broad math knowledge. Relations were also examined between repeating patterning and specific aspects of numeracy knowledge-knowledge of the count sequence to 100 and the successor principle. Children's repeating patterning knowledge was significantly predictive of their broad math and general numeracy knowledge, as well as one specific aspect of their numeracy knowledge (counting to 100), even after controlling for verbal and visual-spatial WM skills. Further, repeating patterning knowledge remained a unique predictor of general numeracy knowledge and counting to 100 after controlling for end-of-pre-K broad math knowledge. The relation between repeating patterning and mathematics may be explained by the central role that identifying predictable sequences based on underlying rules plays in both. Theories of math development and early math instruction standards should thus give even greater attention to the role of children's repeating patterning knowledge.","Zippert, Erica L; Douglas, Ashli-Ann; Rittle-Johnson, Bethany",Journal of experimental child psychology,169,1
72872,72872,72872,Mini open versus open repair techniques in Achilles tendon rupture: clinical and isokinetic evaluation.,12.408414,5.812182,2017,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) is a technique currently used in the treatment of glioblastoma. It consists in applying an electric field (EF) with a frequency of 200 kHz using two pairs of transducer arrays placed on the head. Current should be injected at least 18 h/day and induce a minimum EF intensity of 1 V/cm at the tumor bed for the treatment to be effective. To avoid scalp burns, Optune, the device used to apply this technique in patients, monitors the temperature of the transducers and keeps them below 41 °C by reducing the injected current. The goal of this study was to quantify the impact of the uncertainty associated with the electric and thermal parameters on the predicted temperature of the transducers and of each tissue when TTFields were applied. METHODS We used a realistic head model, added the two pairs of transducers arrays on the scalp and a virtual lesion, mimicking a glioblastoma tumor in the right hemisphere. Minimum, standard and maximum values for the electric and thermal properties of each tissue were taken from the literature after an extensive review. We used finite element methods (COMSOL Multiphysics) to solve Laplace's equation for the electric potential and Pennes' equation for the temperature distribution. RESULTS We observed that the electric conductivity of the scalp and skull, as well as scalp's blood perfusion and thermal conductivity were the parameters to which tissue and transducers temperature were most sensitive to. Considering all simulations, scalp's maximum temperature was around 43.5 °C, skull's 42 °C, CSF's 41.2 °C and brain's 39.3 °C. According to the literature, for this temperature range, some physiological changes are predicted only for the brain. The average temperature of the transducers varied between 38.1 °C and 41.6 °C which suggests that modelling TTFields current injection is very sensitive to the parameters chosen. CONCLUSIONS Better knowledge of the physical properties of tissues and materials and how they change with the temperature is needed to improve the accuracy of these predictions. This information would likely decrease the predicted temperature maxima in the brain and thus help ascertaining TTFields safety from a thermal point of view.","Gentilal, Nichal; Miranda, Pedro Cavaleiro",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,169,2

The risk associated with procedures classed as 'aerosol generating' is under constant debate. Current guidance is largely based on pragmatic and cautious logic, as there is little scientific evidence of aerosolization and transmission of respiratory viruses associated with procedures. The physical properties of aerosol particles which may contain viable virus have implications for the safe use of personal protective equipment and infection control protocols. As elective work in the NHS is reinstated, it is important that the implications of the possibility of airborne transmission of the virus in hospitals are more widely understood. This will facilitate appropriate use of personal protective equipment and help direct further research into the true risks of aerosolization during these procedures to allow safe streamlining of services for staff and patients.","O'Mahony, Hazel R; Martin, Daniel S",British journal of hospital medicine,169,1

Multisource assessments were employed. Children provided self-reports of shyness and internalizing problems, mothers and fathers provided ratings of their adaptive (warmth, reasoning, autonomy) and maladaptive (physical hostility, verbal hostility, punishment) parenting practices, and teacher-rated children's internalizing problem. The results indicated that the relations between shyness and internalizing problems were attenuated among children whose parents were rated higher in adaptive parenting. However, maladaptive parenting did not significantly moderate these associations. The findings underscore the importance of considering the meaning and implication of parenting in Chinese culture.

The study selection was performed using the PubMed database to find studies that investigated the use of NIRS in both the critical care setting and in the intensive care unit. Currently, NIRS in the critical care setting is predominantly being used for infants and neonates. A number of studies in the past decade have shown promising results for the use of NIRS in surgical/trauma intensive care units during shock management as a prognostic tool and in guiding resuscitation. It is evident that over the past 2 decades, NIRS has gone from being a laboratory fascination to an actively employed clinical tool. Even though the benefit of routine use of this technology to achieve better outcomes is still questionable, the fact that NIRS is a low-cost, noninvasive monitoring modality improves the attractiveness of the technology.

Methods Twenty-one 3-month-old male ordinary New Zealand white rabbits were numbered 1 to 42 on the left and right parietal bones. They were divided into 5 groups using a random number table, the control group (group A, 6 sides) and the material group 1, 2, 3, 4 (respectively group B, C, D, E, 9 sides in each group). All animals were prepared with 12-mm-diameter skull defect models, and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) non-covalently bound multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)-COOH+poly ( L-lactide) (PLLA), BMP-2 non-covalently bound MWCNT-NH 2+PLLA, BMP-2 covalently bound MWCNT-COOH+PLLA, and BMP-2 covalently bound MWCNT-NH 2+PLLA were implanted into the defects of groups B, C, D, and E, respectively. At 4, 8, and 12 weeks after operation, the samples were taken for CT scanning and three-dimensional reconstruction, the ratio of bone tissue regeneration volume to total volume and bone mineral density were measured, and the histological observation of HE staining and Masson trichrome staining were performed to quantitatively analyze the volume ratio of new bone tissue. Results CT scanning and three-dimensional reconstruction showed that with the extension of time, the defects in groups A-E were filled gradually, and the defect in group E was completely filled at 12 weeks after operation. HE staining and Masson trichrome staining showed that the volume of new bone tissue in each group gradually increased with time, and regenerated mature bone tissue appeared in groups D and E at 12 weeks after operation. Quantitative analysis showed that at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after operation, the ratio of bone tissue regeneration volume to total volume, bone mineral density, and the volume ratio of new bone tissue increased gradually over time; and at each time point, the above indexes increased gradually from group A to group E, and the differences between groups were significant ( P<0.05). Conclusion Through covalent binding and using -NH 2 to bound peptides with materials, the best bone repair effect can be achieved.","Di, Yuntao; Wang, Cunyang; Zhu, Huixue; Yu, Suxiang; Ren, Yixing; Li, Xiaoming",Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi = Chinese journal of reparative and reconstructive surgery,169,1

Experts recommend that standard health communication campaigns be expanded to include a more holistic approach of behaviourally oriented strategies. We constructed a large-scale Delphi panel of marketing and behavioural science university faculty to assess 12 previously reported US vaccination promotion strategies, asking respondents to assess applicability of the strategy in their country, how efficacy might compare to the USA and recommendations for local adaptations necessary to successful implementation. Separately, we sought to determine whether strategies based on cognitive mechanisms (eg, 'nudges') are more readily generalisable than strategies based on social identity. Ninety-two marketing and behavioural science faculty from universities worldwide participated. Globally, all 12 behavioural strategies were validated; a majority of respondents reported that they would or could work well in their country. While all strategies were strongly validated at a global level, specific need for regional adaptation was identified. Also, open-ended responses suggested the addition of three emergent strategies to a global effort. Finally, we see that strategies based on some types of cognitive mechanisms are more readily generalisable across regions than mechanisms based on social identity, however, this is not always true of 'nudge' strategies. All 12 strategies are robust to global use and consensus exists on adaptation for optimal efficacy in different regions; specific strategy recommendations are posited. Use of these strategies can accelerate individual country efforts to achieve desired vaccination rates to protect global public health.","Wood, Stacy; Pate, Muhammad Ali; Schulman, Kevin",BMJ global health,169,1

This study describes pathophysiologic effects of the acutely elevated intra-abdominal pressure on microvascular fluid exchange and microcirculation. The resulting changes could contribute to development of organ dysfunction or failure. METHODS 16 pigs were randomly allocated to a control-group (C-group) or an interventional group (P-group). After 60 min of stabilization, intra-abdominal pressure of the P-group animals was elevated to 15 mmHg by Helium insufflation and after 120 min to a level of 30 mmHg for two more hours. The C-group animals were observed without insufflation of gas. Laboratory and hemodynamic parameters, plasma volume, plasma colloid osmotic pressure, total tissue water content, tissue perfusion, markers of inflammation and cerebral energy metabolism were measured and net fluid balance and fluid extravasation rates calculated. Analysis of variance for repeated measurements with post-tests were used to evaluate the results with respect to differences within or between the groups. RESULTS In the C-group hematocrit, net fluid balance, plasma volume and the fluid extravasation rate remained essentially unchanged throughout the study as opposed to the increase in hematocrit (P < 0.001), fluid extravasation rate (P < 0.05) and decrease in plasma volume (P < 0.001) of the P-group. Hemodynamic parameters remained stable or were slightly elevated in the C-group while the P-group demonstrated an increase in femoral venous pressure (P < 0.001), right atrial pressure (P < 0.001), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (P < 0.01) and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (P < 0.001). The protein mass decreased in both study groups but was significantly lower in the P-group as compared with the C-group, after 240 min of intervention. The increased intra-abdominal pressure was associated with elevated intracranial pressure and reduced tissue perfusion of the pancreas and the gastric- and intestinal mucosa. CONCLUSION Elevation of intra-abdominal pressure has an immediate impact on microvascular fluid extravasation leading to plasma volume contraction, reduced cardiac output and deranged perfusion of abdominal organs.","Elvevoll, Bjørg; Husby, Paul; Øvrebø, Kjell; Haugen, Oddbjørn",BMC research notes,169,10

In response to ongoing importations of poliovirus into polio-free countries, on 5 May 2014, WHO's Director-General declared the international spread of wild poliovirus a public health emergency of international concern. Our objective was to develop a mathematical model to estimate the international spread of polio infections. METHODS Our model took into account polio endemicity in polio-infected countries, population size, polio immunization coverage rates, infectious period, the asymptomatic-to-symptomatic ratio, and also the probability of a traveler being infectious at the time of travel. We applied our model to three scenarios: (1) number of exportations of both symptomatic and asymptomatic polio infections out of currently polio-infected countries, (2) the risk of spread of poliovirus to Saudi Arabia via Hajj pilgrims, and (3) the importation risk of poliovirus into India. RESULTS Our model estimated 665 polio exportations (>99 % of which were asymptomatic) from nine polio-infected countries in 2014, of which 78.3 % originated from Pakistan. Our model also estimated 21 importations of poliovirus into Saudi Arabia via Hajj pilgrims and 20 poliovirus infections imported to India in the same year. CONCLUSION The extent of importations of asymptomatic and symptomatic polio infections is substantial. For countries that are vulnerable to polio outbreaks due to poor national polio immunization coverage rates, our newly developed model may help guide policy-makers to decide whether imposing an entry requirement in terms of proof of vaccination against polio would be justified.","Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Leong, Wei-Yee; Lopez, Luis Fernandez; Amaku, Marcos; Quam, Mikkel; Khan, Kamran; Massad, Eduardo",BMC medicine,169,8

Apart from being essential proteins for various organisms living in sub-zero temperatures, AFPs have numerous applications in different industries. They possess very small resemblance to each other and cannot be easily identified using simple search algorithms such as BLAST and PSI-BLAST. Diverse AFPs found in fishes (Type I, II, III, IV and antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs)), are sub-types and show low sequence and structural similarity, making their accurate prediction challenging. Although several machine-learning methods have been proposed for the classification of AFPs, prediction methods that have greater reliability are required. In this paper, we propose a novel machine-learning-based approach for the prediction of AFP sequences using latent space learning through a deep auto-encoder method. For latent space pruning, we use the output of the auto-encoder with a deep neural network classifier to learn the non-linear mapping of the protein sequence descriptor and class label. The proposed method outperformed the existing methods, yielding excellent results in comparison. A comprehensive ablation study is performed, and the proposed method is evaluated in terms of widely used performance measures. In particular, the proposed method demonstrated a high Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.52, F-score of 0.49, and Youden's index of 0.81 on an independent test dataset, thereby outperforming the existing methods for AFP prediction.","Usman, Muhammad; Khan, Shujaat; Lee, Jeong-A",Scientific reports,169,9

While birds and reptiles largely rely on mineralized shells, plants often develop highly robust lignocellulosic shells. Despite the abundance of hard plant shells, particularly nutshells, it remains unclear which fundamental properties drive their mechanical stability. This multiscale analysis of six prominent (nut)shells (pine, pistachio, walnut, pecan, hazelnut, and macadamia) reveals geometric and structural strengthening mechanisms on the cellular and macroscopic length scales. The strongest tissues, found in walnut and pistachio, exploit the topological interlocking of 3D-puzzle cells and thereby outperform the fiber-reinforced structure of macadamia under tensile and compressive loading. On the macroscopic scale, strengthening occurs via an increased shell thickness, spherical shape, small size, and a lack of extended sutures. These functional interrelations suggest that simple geometric modifications are a powerful and resource-efficient strategy for plants to enhance the fracture resistance of entire shells and their tissues. Understanding the interplay between structure, geometry, and mechanics in hard plant shells provides new perspectives on the evolutionary diversification of hard seed coats, as well as insights for nutshell-based material applications.","Huss, Jessica C; Antreich, Sebastian J; Bachmayr, Jakob; Xiao, Nannan; Eder, Michaela; Konnerth, Johannes; Gierlinger, Notburga",Advanced materials,169,16

The sorption and the immobilization experiments indicated a higher sorption capacity and immobilization efficiency of Pb compared to those of Cd. The characteristics of XRD, FTIR, SEM, and XPS manifested that dissolution-precipitation, cation exchange, complexation, and cation-π interaction were the main four mechanisms for the sorption of Pb2+ and Cd2+ using composite material PC1 (nHAP/BC = 1/1). From semi-quantitative analysis, the mineral effect accounted for the majority of the immobilization of Pb and Cd. Due to obvious Pb-precipitates in the sorbed material, dissolution-precipitation primarily affected the sorption of Pb using PC1, while the immobilization of Cd was mainly attributable to cation exchange. Such results corresponded to the stable Pb-precipitates and unstable Cd-compounds in soil, among which the latter was prone to be released into the environment. The sorption capacity in aqueous solutions and the immobilization efficiencies in the soil for both Pb and Cd increased with the addition of nHAP, which were linearly correlated to the nHAP proportion in the composite materials. In future practical applications, the percentages of composite materials can be designed according to the specific pollutant concentration. This study sheds light on the explicit immobilization mechanisms for Pb and Cd in aqueous solutions to better understand their behaviors in the soil remediated by relevant materials.","Zhou, Cailing; Song, Xin; Wang, Yiwei; Wang, Hui; Ge, Shifu",Chemosphere,169,1

Responses were gathered from May 13 to 12 June 2020. Risk factors measured included the newly developed Pandemic Experiences and Perceptions Scale (PEPS) subscales, contact with virus, pandemic preparation, and provincial caseload. The primary outcome was the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). The primary outcome was completed by 309 respondents. Latent profile analysis found 107 (34.6%) respondents were burned out. In multivariate analysis, exhaustion was independently associated with PEPS adequacy, risk perception, and worklife subscales (adjusted R2 = 0.236, P < 0.001). Cynicism was associated with exhaustion, and PEPS worklife (adjusted R2 = 0.543, P < 0.001). Efficacy was associated with cynicism, PEPS worklife, and active cases (adjusted R2 = 0.152, P < 0.001). Structural equation modelling showed statistically significant direct paths between PEPS areas of worklife and all MBI subscales. Contact with virus, preparation, and PEPS risk perception added to the prediction of MBI exhaustion.

INTERPRÉTATION: Nous avons observé un lien étroit entre les symptômes olfactifs et gustatifs et la positivité au SRAS-CoV-2. Ces symptômes devraient être considérés comme une caractéristique fréquente et distinctive de l’infection au SRAS-CoV-2 et devraient servir d’indication de dépistage, et même de répétition du dépistage chez les personnes dont le résultat initial est négatif.","Carignan, Alex; Valiquette, Louis; Grenier, Cynthia; Musonera, Jean Berchmans; Nkengurutse, Delphin; Marcil-Héguy, Anaïs; Vettese, Kim; Marcoux, Dominique; Valiquette, Corinne; Xiong, Wei Ting; Fortier, Pierre-Hughes; Généreux, Mélissa; Pépin, Jacques",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,169,4

DATA SOURCES Ten databases were searched on 16 October 2020: MEDLINE via PubMed, PsycINFO, Global Health, LILACS, Embase, ABI/Inform, CINAHL, Business Source Complete, Web of Science and Scopus, plus grey literature searches using Google and the RAND Publication Database. STUDY SELECTION Included studies used inferential statistics about adult participants to examine associations between tobacco retailer density/proximity and tobacco use behaviours and health outcomes. Of 7373 studies reviewed by independent coders, 37 (0.5%) met inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION Effect sizes were converted to a relative risk reduction (RRR) metric, indicating the presumed reduction in tobacco use outcomes based on reducing tobacco retailer density and decreasing proximity. DATA SYNTHESIS We conducted a random effects meta-analysis and examined heterogeneity across 27 studies through subgroup analyses and meta-regression. Tobacco retailer density (RRR=2.55, 95% CI 1.91 to 3.19, k=155) and proximity (RRR=2.38, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.37, k=100) were associated with tobacco use behaviours. Pooled results including both density and proximity found an estimated 2.48% reduction in risk of tobacco use from reductions in tobacco retailer density and proximity (RRR=2.48, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.02, k=255). Results for health outcomes came from just two studies and were not significant. Considerable heterogeneity existed. CONCLUSIONS Across studies, lower levels of tobacco retailer density and decreased proximity are associated with lower tobacco use. Reducing tobacco supply by limiting retailer density and proximity may lead to reductions in tobacco use. Policy evaluations are needed.","Lee, Joseph G L; Kong, Amanda Y; Sewell, Kerry B; Golden, Shelley D; Combs, Todd B; Ribisl, Kurt M; Henriksen, Lisa",Tobacco control,169,1

Currently there is no specific vaccine or drug against COVID-19. Xu et al. (2020) built a homolog model of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro based on SARS-CoV Mpro which is considered as target to inhibit the replication of CoV. OBJECTIVE The aim of current study is to find potential inhibitors of COVID-19 Mpro using docking analysis. METHODS Autodockvina was used to carry out Protein-Ligand docking. COVID-19 main protease Mpro was docked with catechin and its different synthetic derivatives. Nelfinavir is an antiretroviral drug belongs to protease inhibitors was taken as standard. RESULTS According to the result obtained it was found that Compound (4) and Compound (1) have more affinity than nelfinavir. CONCLUSION Compounds have a great potential to become COVID-19 main protease Mpro inhibitor.

Older adults are one group for whom making agendas are being pursued, with envisioned outcomes such as supporting agency and well-being. However, research on making and DIY with older adults typically study individuals who are already engaged in making practices or bring individuals in to a technology environment that has already been created. In this paper, we study the older adult-driven formation of a makerspace in an independent living community. Through an ethnographically-informed approach, we studied the ways that individuals considered appropriate allocation of resources towards a makerspace, scoped activities, evaluated goals, and made trade-ofs. Our analysis is centered around describing the way that this makerspace formed as well as three ways that individuals made sense of the makerspace as the planning unfolded: the openness of a space that promises to cater to interests of the population; the promise of a makerspace to involve more residents in technology, but the need to obscure the technology to make it appealing; and a valuation of the return on investment for limited fnancial and space resources. Our discussion contributes to supporting and studying early adoption of technology by older adults, complicates visions of ""making for all,"" and presents considerations regarding the often under-specifed community of a makerspace.","Lazar, Amanda; Pradhan, Alisha; Jelen, Ben; Siek, Katie A; Leitch, Alex",Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on human factors in computing systems.

Despite this strong evidence base, NIV seems to be under-utilized and the failure rate (need for intubation) may be as high as 40%. Some of these failures potentially relate to asynchrony, although the relationship between asynchrony and NIV failure has not been well studied. Good NIV tolerance has been associated with success of NIV, and improved comfort has been associated with better synchrony. In one study a high rate of asynchrony occurred in 43% of patients during NIV. Asynchrony is commonly associated with leaks. Thus, reducing the leak related to the interface and using a ventilator with good leak compensation should reduce the rate of asynchrony. Asynchronies can also be related to the underlying disease process. This paper reviews issues related to asynchrony during NIV and suggests strategies that might be used to correct asynchrony when it occurs.","Hess, Dean R",Respiratory care,169,20

Surveillance data were collected from DOH's Online National Electronic Injury Surveillance System and analysed. A case was defined as any person who had sustained injury from fireworks in any form within the 16-day surveillance period (21 December to 5 January) and had presented to any of the 50 sentinel hospitals. Of the 4649 cases, there were 4706 fireworks-related injuries involving 5076 anatomic sites in 2010-2014. A significant decrease of cases in 2014 was observed when compared with the previous study years (P = 0.02). The number of cases peaked at public holidays. Males (80%) were more commonly injured, and children aged 5 to 14 years were primarily affected (47%). Ignition of illegal fireworks accounted for half (50%) of the injuries; most injuries (68%) occurred in street settings. The majority of injuries (57%) were sustained by fireworks igniters. The most common anatomic injury sites were hands (44%), legs (21%) and eyes (14%). Illegal fireworks were related to 100% (4/4) of the deaths and 49% (105/214) of the cases who needed amputations. Fireworks-related injuries declined significantly in 2014. Public awareness campaigns may have contributed to reducing the injury occurrences. As illegal fireworks accounted for all deaths and more than half of the amputations, law enforcement should be directed towards preventing importing, distributing and using illegal fireworks.","Roca, John Bobbie; de los Reyes, Vikki Carr; Racelis, Sheryl; Deveraturda, Imelda; Sucaldito, Ma Nemia; Tayag, Enrique; O'Reilly, Michael",Western Pacific surveillance and response journal : WPSAR,169,5

Each country implemented prevention and control strategies, mainly classified as SARS LCS (SARS-like containment strategy) or PAIN LMS (pandemic influenza-like mitigation strategy). The reasons for variation in each strategy's efficacy in controlling COVID-19 epidemics were unclear and are investigated in this paper. On the basis of the daily number of confirmed local (imported) cases and onset-to-confirmation distributions for local cases, we initially estimated the daily number of local (imported) illness onsets by a deconvolution method for mainland China, South Korea, Japan and Spain, and then estimated the effective reproduction numbers Rt by using a Bayesian method for each of the four countries. China and South Korea adopted a strict SARS LCS, to completely block the spread via lockdown, strict travel restrictions and by detection and isolation of patients, which led to persistent declines in effective reproduction numbers. In contrast, Japan and Spain adopted a typical PAIN LMS to mitigate the spread via maintaining social distance, self-quarantine and isolation etc., which reduced the Rt values but with oscillations around 1. The finding suggests that governments may need to consider multiple factors such as quantities of medical resources, the likely extent of the public's compliance to different intensities of intervention measures, and the economic situation to design the most appropriate policies to fight COVID-19 epidemics.","Xia, Fan; Xiao, Yanni; Liu, Pei Yu; Cheke, Robert A; Li, Xuan Ya",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,169,1

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of exercise training on clinical outcomes in CRT recipients. METHODS A comprehensive search until 2019 was conducted of MEDLINE, Epub, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane databases as well as a bibliographic hand search to identify additional studies. We included all studies that compared aerobic exercise interventions in adults treated with CRT devices with adults treated with usual CRT care. These studies evaluated patient clinical characteristics, exercise testing measures, hemodynamic measures, echocardiography parameters, biomarkers and adverse events. Independent reviewers evaluated study eligibility, abstracted data and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We used random-effect meta-analysis methods to estimate mean differences and odds ratios. Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system were used to quantify absolute effects and quality of evidence. I2 was used to evaluate heterogeneity. RESULTS We identified seven studies, six randomized control trials and one observational study, totaling 332 CRT patients in the exercise intervention and 534 patients receiving usual care. Peak VO2 was 2.4 ml/kg/min higher in the exercise group in comparison with the control group (pooled mean difference 2.26, 95% CI 1.38-3.13, I2 = 53%, high quality). AT-VO2 improved with exercise rehabilitation, and heterogeneity was considered low (pooled mean difference 3.96, 95% CI 2.68-5.24, I2 = 0.0%, moderate quality). CONCLUSION Peak VO2 and AT-VO2 are increased with aerobic exercise in CRT recipients, demonstrating a significant improvement in functional capacity.","Grosman-Rimon, Liza; Hui, Sarah; Santos, Sara; Vadasz, Brian; Foroutan, Farid; Farrell, Ashley; Lalonde, Spencer; Ghashghai, Arash; McDonald, Michael; Alba, Ana C",Heart failure reviews,169,7

Antiplatelet resistance negates the protective effects of antiplatelet medication, leading to a higher incidence of ischemic events. A possible link between antiplatelet hyper-response and increased hemorrhagic complications has been inadequately investigated. We aimed to examine the correlation between antiplatelet hyper-response and the risk of hemorrhagic complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients who were treated with antiplatelet medications and underwent neurointerventional procedures were prospectively recruited. We collected the following data: demographics, vascular risk factors, antiplatelet and anticoagulation treatment, antiplatelet responsiveness, coagulation profile, and hemorrhagic complications. P2Y12 receptor-mediated platelet inhibition was tested by using the VerifyNow assay device. The primary end points were postprocedural major and minor hemorrhagic complications. Receiver operator characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the percentage of platelet inhibition as a diagnostic tool for bleeding events. The association between hemorrhage and percentage of platelet inhibition was investigated by using logistic regression modeling. RESULTS Forty-seven patients were enrolled. The mean age was 56±12 years, and 28% were men. Ten patients (21.3%) developed hemorrhagic complications. Clopidogrel response was higher in patients with a major bleeding complication compared with those with minor or no bleeding (median, 94% versus 24% platelet inhibition; P=.0084). Of the 7 patients (14.9%) defined as hyper-responders with ≥72% platelet inhibition, 42.8% had a major bleeding complication. CONCLUSIONS Hyper-response to clopidogrel is associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic complications. Larger studies are urgently needed to validate a clinically useful threshold to define clopidogrel hyper-response and to examine the clinical effects of antiplatelet dosage adjustment.","Goh, C; Churilov, L; Mitchell, P; Dowling, R; Yan, B",AJNR.

Abiotic variables (such as temperature, ammonia, and nitrite) and contaminants (e.g. pesticides) can potentially interact, increasing metabolism and the absorption of toxic substances, which can alter the ability of organisms to establish adequate stress responses. This study aimed to verify which pesticides were most frequently found and in the greatest quantities in low-order streams, and whether the combination of these pesticides with the abiotic variables altered the biological metabolism of aeglids. These freshwater crustaceans are important shredders that inhabit low-order streams and are sensitive to disturbances and/or abrupt environmental variations. The animals were exposed in situ in four streams (reference site and sites 1, 2, and 3). The reference site is a preserved stream with no apparent anthropogenic interference where aeglids still occur, while the other sites no longer exhibit populations of these animals and are influenced by agricultural activities. The exposure was performed bimonthly from November 2017 to September 2018 and lasted 96 h. Measured abiotic data and water samples were collected through all days of exposure. The analyzed biochemical parameters were acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle; and glutathione S-transferase, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, non-protein thiols, antioxidant capacity against peroxides, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in muscle, gills, and hepatopancreas. We found 24 active principles of pesticides, the most frequently being clomazone, atrazine, and propoxur. Bentazone was present at the highest amounts. The parameters evaluated in this study, including biochemical biomarkers and abiotic factors measured from the water, provided a separation of the months as a function of environmental conditions. There was a difference in activity and biomarker levels throughout the year within the same site and in some months between sites. The greater concentration or variety of pesticides associated with extreme abiotic (very high temperatures) data generated increased oxidative stress, with high levels of protein damage and considerable lipid damage in all tissues, as well as elevation in ROS, even with high levels of antioxidant capacity and non-protein thiols. With these data, we intend to warn about the risks of exposure to these environmental conditions by trying to contribute to the preservation of limnic fauna, especially aeglid crabs, because most species are under some degree of threat.","Cerezer, Cristina; Marins, Aline Teixeira; Cerezer, Felipe Osmari; Severo, Eduardo Stringini; Leitemperger, Jossiele Wesz; Grubel Bandeira, Nelson Miguel; Zanella, Renato; Loro, Vania Lucia; Santos, Sandro",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,169,33

The anxiety level of mothers was measured before and after study using Spielberger Inventory along with the labour pain. To improve the strength of this study, a meta-analysis was conducted on the effect of acupressure in point LI-4 on anxiety during labour. Ninety women in labour were randomly divided into three groups: acupressure with ice, acupressure without ice and the control group. The result suggested that women receiving both acupressure with ice (p = .005) or without ice (p < .001) experienced less labour pain in comparison with the control group. Also, the labour pain severity in acupressure without ice was lower than the group with ice (p < .001). Acupressure with (p = 1) or without (p = .09) ice was not significantly different from the control group in terms of the anxiety level. However, women in the group of acupressure without ice experienced less anxiety in comparison with acupressure with ice (p = .04). The difference in pain severity before and after treatment with acupressure with (RCI = 2.86) or without ice (RCI = 5.54) was clinically significant. The intervention was not clinically meaningful in terms of anxiety.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Previous trials have exhibited that acupressure with/without ice reduced pain and anxiety during labour.What do the results of this subject add? The results of this research was consistent with previous studies, suggesting that acupressure, with or without ice, is more effective than the control group regarding labour pain. However, the group of acupressure with ice was not different from the control group with respect to the anxiety level.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? In light of advantages, such as growing preference of women, researcher and health care providers for physiological delivery coupled with its safety and simplicity, it can be used as an effective technique to manage labour pain.

Performance on post-curricular tests was compared between CTs who participated in the new curriculum to those who did not. METHODS The simulation-based curriculum was developed by content and education experts. Simulations sequentially taught the skills necessary for initiating and weaning from CPB as well as managing crises by adding fidelity and complexity to scenarios. Nine CTs were randomly assigned to the new curriculum (n=5) or the traditional curriculum (n=4). Skills were assessed using tests of medical knowledge and technical, communication (GRS) and critical thinking (SCT) skills. A two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test compared average scores between the two groups. Alpha of 0.05 was set to indicate statistically significant differences. RESULTS The resutls revealed that CTs in the new curriculum significantly outperformed CTs in the traditional curriculum on technical (18.2 vs 14.8, p=0.05) and communication (3.5 vs 2.2, p=0.013) skills. There was no significant difference between CTs in the new curriculum in the Script Concordance Test (16.5 vs 14.8, p=0.141) and knowledge tests (26.9 vs 24.6, p=0.14) compared to CTs in the traditional curriculum. CONCLUSION Our new curriculum teaches communication and technical skills necessary for CPB. The results of this pilot study are encouraging and relevant. They give grounds for future research with a larger panel of trainees. Based on the current distribution of scores, a sample size of 12 CTs per group should yield significant results for all tests.","Fouilloux, V; Doguet, F; Kotsakis, A; Dubrowski, A; Berdah, S",Perfusion,169,28

Despite its primary effect on the respiratory system, the virus does not solely impact those with underlying lung conditions as initially predicted. Indeed, prognosis is worsened (often fatal) in patients with pre-existing hyperinflammatory responses (e.g., hypertension, obesity, diabetes), yet the mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. A number of psychological conditions are associated with inflammation, suggesting that these may also be significant risk factors for negative outcomes of COVID-19. In this review, we evaluate preclinical and clinical literature suggesting that chronic stress-induced hyperinflammation interacts synergistically with COVID-19-related inflammation, contributing to a potentially fatal cytokine storm syndrome. In particular, we hypothesize that both chronic stress and COVID-19-related hyperinflammation are a product of glucocorticoid insufficiency. We discuss the devastating effects of SARS-CoV-2 on structural and functional aspects of the biological stress response and how these induce exaggerated inflammatory responses, particularly interleukin (IL)-6 hypersecretion. We postulate that chronic stress should be considered a significant risk factor for adverse COVID-19-related health outcomes, given overlapping peripheral and central immune dysregulation in both conditions. We conclude by discussing how people with a history of chronic stress could mitigate their risk for COVID-19 complications, identifying specific strategies that can be implemented during self-isolation.

Previous studies showed that HCoV-NL63 and the genetically distant severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV employ the same receptor for host cell entry, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but it is largely unclear whether ACE2 interactions are sufficient to allow HCoV-NL63 binding to cells. The present study showed that directed expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on cells previously resistant to HCoV-NL63 renders them susceptible, showing that ACE2 protein acts as a functional receptor and that its expression is required for infection. However, comparative analysis showed that directed expression or selective scission of the ACE2 protein had no measurable effect on virus adhesion. In contrast, binding of HCoV-NL63 to heparan sulfates was required for viral attachment and infection of target cells, showing that these molecules serve as attachment receptors for HCoV-NL63. IMPORTANCE ACE2 protein was proposed as a receptor for HCoV-NL63 already in 2005, but an in-depth analysis of early events during virus infection had not been performed thus far. Here, we show that the ACE2 protein is required for viral entry but that it is not the primary binding site on the cell surface. Conducted research showed that heparan sulfate proteoglycans function as adhesion molecules, increasing the virus density on cell surface and possibly facilitating the interaction between HCoV-NL63 and its receptor. Obtained results show that the initial events during HCoV-NL63 infection are more complex than anticipated and that a newly described interaction may be essential for understanding the infection process and, possibly, also assist in drug design.","Milewska, Aleksandra; Zarebski, Miroslaw; Nowak, Paulina; Stozek, Karol; Potempa, Jan; Pyrc, Krzysztof",Journal of virology,169,1

The present study investigates the antiviral potential of I. obliquus terpenoids against COVID-19 using a molecular docking study. The in silico study elucidates the ability of most of the terpenoid components to interact with the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with excellent affinity.

Peer simulation involves students portraying patient roles, and may reduce costs while still providing the benefits of other SBE experiences. However, the quality of the SBE may be impacted if students cannot portray authentic and realistic patient roles. The aim of this study was to investigate whether targeted education was associated with observable changes to physiotherapy students' abilities to portray patient roles in SBE. METHODS Second year pre-registration physiotherapy students (n = 40) participated. Students completed online and face-to-face education about SBE, patient portrayal skills, and how to portray a specific patient role. Students were video-recorded portraying patient roles in practical exams before and after the program. Three blinded independent assessors rated the overall quality of portrayals using a purpose-developed assessment instrument. RESULTS Twenty-three sets of pre- and post-program videos were analysed. Correlations between assessor scores spanned 0.62 to 0.82 for analyses of interest, which justified using average assessor ratings in analysis. Statistically significant higher scores were seen for post-program assessments for overall portrayal scores (mean difference 6.5, 95%CI [1.51-11.45], p = 0.013), accuracy (mean difference 3.4, 95%CI [0.69-6.13], p = 0.016) and quality (mean difference 3.1, 95%CI [0.64-5.49], p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS Physiotherapy students appear capable of playing realistic patient roles. Peer simulation can be embedded into health professional programs, and education in patient role portrayal appears to be associated with improvements in portrayal quality and realism. Given these findings, further investigation, including testing program effects in a randomised study, is warranted.","Pritchard, Shane A; Keating, Jennifer L; Nestel, Debra; Blackstock, Felicity C",BMC medical education,169,27

Our study aims to figure out the role of Smad4 in an insulin resistance (IR) cellular model using placental trophoblast cell line. Importantly, HTR8-Svneo cells, in the status of IR, indicated a significant increase in the expression of Smad4. Subsequently, the HTR8-Svneo cell line with up-regulated or depleted Smad4 was respectively achieved by the effective over-expressed plasmid or siRNA of Smad4. We found out that the deficiency of Smad4 could promote the insulin sensitivity and restrict the inflammatory response in IR group of cells with significant augment in glucose uptake, up-regulation of insulin signalling-related molecules and attenuation in inflammatory biomarker expressions. On the contrary, the over-expression of Smad4 showed a reversal effect on these alterations in IR group of cells. Besides, the positive effect of Smad4 on cell viability was also observed in our study. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a metabolic disorder whose major pathophysiological basis is demonstrated as insulin resistance (IR).

The goal of the study was to identify the predictors of a good outcome after mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers. METHODS A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database included consecutive patients treated with stent retrievers. We evaluated the influence of risk factors for stroke, baseline NIHSS score, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT (ASPECT) score, recanalization rate, onset-to-recanalization and onset-to-groin puncture time, and glucose levels at admission on good outcomes. The number of stent passes during procedure and symptomatic hemorrhage rate were also recorded. A modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 at 90 days was considered as a good outcome. RESULTS From January 2011 to 2014, 70 consecutive patients with an acute ischemic stroke underwent EVT with stent retrievers. The absence of a medical history of diabetes was associated with good outcomes. Apart from diabetes, the baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of patients were similar between subjects with poor outcome versus those with good outcomes. Median time from onset to recanalization was significantly shorter in patients with good outcomes 245 (IQR: 216-313 min) compared with poor outcome patients (315 (IQR: 240-360 min); P = 0.023). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was observed in eight (21.6%) of 37 patients with poor outcomes and no symptomatic hemorrhage was seen in patients with good outcomes (P = 0.006). In multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis, a favorable ASPECT score (ASPECT > 7) and successful recanalization after EVT were predictors of good outcomes. Every 10-year increase was associated with a 3.60-fold decrease in the probability of a good outcome at 3 months. The probability of a good outcome decreases by 1.43-fold for each 20 mg/dL increase in the blood glucose at admission. CONCLUSION To achieve a good outcome after EVT with stent retrievers, quick and complete recanalization and better strategies for patient selection are warranted. We need randomized trials to identify the significance of tight blood glucose control in clinical outcome during or after EVT.","Ozdemir, Ozcan; Giray, Semih; Arlier, Zulfikar; Baş, Demet Funda; Inanc, Yusuf; Colak, Ertugrul",TheScientificWorldJournal,169,16

When applied to the target organism, these vaccines induce the expression of encoded antigens and elicit the corresponding immune response, with the potential ability of being able to induce antibody-, helper T cell-, and cytotoxic T cell-mediated immune responses. AREAS COVERED Special attention is paid to the variety of adjuvants that may be co-administered to enhance and/or to modulate immune responses, and to the methods of delivery. Finally, this article reviews the efficacy data of gene vaccines against infectious diseases released from current clinical trials. EXPERT OPINION Taken together, this approach will have a major impact on future strategies for the prevention of infectious diseases. Better-designed nucleic acid constructs, novel delivery technologies, as well as the clarification of the mechanisms for antigen presentation will improve the potential applications of this vaccination strategy against microbial pathogens.","Marć, Małgorzata Anna; Domínguez-Álvarez, Enrique; Gamazo, Carlos",Expert opinion on drug delivery,169,24

This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of interactive digital interventions (IDIs) for prevention of sexually transmitted HIV. METHODS We conducted a systematic search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of IDIs for HIV prevention, defining 'interactive' as producing personally tailored material. We searched databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, grey literature, reference lists, and contacted authors if needed.Two authors screened abstracts, applied eligibility and quality criteria and extracted data. Meta-analyses used random-effects models with standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes and odds ratios for binary outcomes, assessing heterogeneity using the I statistic. RESULTS We included 31 RCTs of IDIs for HIV prevention. Meta-analyses of 29 RCTs comparing IDIs with minimal interventions (e.g. leaflet, waiting list) showed a moderate increase in knowledge (SMD 0.56, 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.80), no effect on self-efficacy (SMD 0.13, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.27), a small improvement in intention (SMD 0.16, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.26), improvement in HIV prevention behaviours (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.57) and a possible increase in viral load, but this finding is unreliable.We found no evidence of difference between IDIs and face-to-face interventions for knowledge, self-efficacy, intention, or HIV-related behaviours in meta-analyses of five small RCTs.

METHODS The retrospective cohort study included 63 patients who underwent transvaginal surgery using a synthetic polypropylene mesh (Gynemesh™) for cystocele. Patients were evaluated using a clinical examination (POP-Q) and validated questionnaires (PGI-I, PFDI-20, PFIQ-7) at 18 years of follow-up (median 18 years [IQR 16-19]). Cumulative death rate was 13 out of 63 (20%) and rate of total loss to follow-up was 21 out of 50 (42%). Finally, among the 63 women who underwent surgery, 29 completed maximum follow-up and 21 underwent a clinical examination. RESULTS The cumulative reoperation rate was 35% (22 out of 63). Three patients were reoperated on because of recurrence of pelvic organ prolapse. Among the 63 patients initially operated, vaginal mesh exposure occurred in 16 (25%) during follow-up and 11 women (17%) needed a reintervention for vaginal mesh exposure. One patient was reoperated on for bladder mesh exposure. Among the 29 women who completed follow-up, the overall postoperative improvement rate was 93% after 18 years (PGI-I: 1-3). Mean overall satisfaction rate was 80 out of 100. Functional success rate was 76% (22 out of 29) and anatomical success rate was 62% (13 out of 21). The median score of the POP-DI-6 was 4.1 (IQR: 0-11) and the median score of the PFDI-20 was 30.7 (IQR: 13-60) in the 29 women who completed maximum follow-up. CONCLUSION At very long-term follow-up, the recurrence rate of cystocele following polypropylene mesh placement by the vaginal route remained low and the satisfaction rate was high. However, we found high cumulative reoperation and mesh exposure rates.","Vinchant, Marie; Bitumba, Iris; Letouzey, Vincent; Fernandez, Hervé; de Tayrac, Renaud; Deffieux, Xavier",International urogynecology journal,169,31

Pterostilbene (PTE), an analog of stilbene and resveratrol, has attracted attention in recent years due to its significant antitumor activity in multiple solid tumors; however, its effect on drug-resistant glioma cells and the underlying mechanism have not yet been reported. In this study, we found that pterostilbene inhibited proliferation, induced intrinsic mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and caused S phase arrest, inhibited migration and excessive invasion in glioma cells. Pretreatment with the pan-caspase-inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK attenuated the PTE-induced apoptosis of glioma cells. Moreover, PTE significantly increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Inhibition of ROS with N-acetyl-L-cysteine not only rescued PTE-induced reduction of cellular viability but also prevented glioma cell apoptosis. We also discovered ERK 1/2 and JNK signaling pathways were activated by PTE and contributed to induce glioma cell apoptosis. In addition, specific inhibitors of ERK 1/2 and JNK attenuated PTE-induced apoptosis. Besides, PTE significantly reduced tumor volume and prolonged median survival of tumor-bearing rats in vivo. In summary, the results of this study indicate that the anti-tumor effect of PTE on glioma cells may provide a new treatment option for glioma patients.","Gao, Haijun; Liu, Ziqiang; Xu, Weidong; Wang, Qunhui; Zhang, Chaochao; Ding, Yaonan; Nie, Weiguang; Lai, Jiacheng; Chen, Yong; Huang, Haiyan",Scientific reports,169,27

According to meta-analyses, administration of systemic prophylactic antibiotics for PEG reduces peristomal infection. However, with several recent developments in the procedure and instruments, the risk of infection might have been reduced. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis for a modified introducer method of PEG. METHODS This prospective, randomized, double-blind trial assessed 278 patients undergoing PEG for inclusion. Ninety-one patients with an indication for PEG who gave informed consent to participate were randomized. Forty-six patients received prophylactic ampicillin and 45 patients received a placebo. A modified introducer method of PEG using a Seldinger PEG kit was performed. The primary outcome was the occurrence of clinically evident wound infection within 3 days after PEG. RESULTS Wound infection within 3 days was observed in none in the prophylaxis group and in 1 patient in the control group (P=0.4945). There was no significant difference between 2 groups in the other parameters, including peristomal infection within 7 days, overall infection, white blood cell counts, C-reactive protein level, and successive rate of finishing antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS For wound infection within 3 days, noninferiority of the placebo group to the antibiotics group was preliminarily suggested with our criteria, but not for peristomal infection within 7 days. More strict criteria for noninferiority should be examined in a further large sample study.","Adachi, Yasushi; Akino, Kimishige; Mita, Hiroaki; Kikuchi, Takefumi; Yamashita, Kentaro; Sasaki, Yasushi; Arimura, Yoshiaki; Endo, Takao",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,169,27

We aimed to examine the link between vitamin D supplementation and prevention of ARIs in an updated meta-analysis. METHODS For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for studies listed from database inception to May 1, 2020. Double-blind RCTs of vitamin D3, vitamin D2, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) supplementation for any duration, with a placebo or low-dose vitamin D control, were eligible if they had been approved by a research ethics committee, and if ARI incidence was collected prospectively and prespecified as an efficacy outcome. Studies reporting results of long-term follow-up of primary RCTs were excluded. Aggregated study-level data, stratified by baseline 25(OH)D concentration and age, were obtained from study authors. Using the proportion of participants in each trial who had one or more ARIs, we did a random-effects meta-analysis to obtain pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs to estimate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of having one or more ARIs (primary outcome) compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses were done to estimate whether the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of ARI varied according to baseline 25(OH)D concentration (<25 nmol/L vs 25·0-49·9 nmol/L vs 50·0-74·9 nmol/L vs >75·0 nmol/L), vitamin D dose (daily equivalent of <400 international units [IU] vs 400-1000 IU vs 1001-2000 IU vs >2000 IU), dosing frequency (daily vs weekly vs once per month to once every 3 months), trial duration (≤12 months vs >12 months), age at enrolment (<1·00 years vs 1·00-15·99 years vs 16·00-64·99 years vs ≥65·00 years), and presence versus absence of airway disease (ie, asthma only, COPD only, or unrestricted). Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020190633. FINDINGS We identified 1528 articles, of which 46 RCTs (75 541 participants) were eligible. Data for the primary outcome were obtained for 48 488 (98·1%) of 49 419 participants (aged 0-95 years) in 43 studies. A significantly lower proportion of participants in the vitamin D supplementation group had one or more ARIs (14 332 [61·3%] of 23 364 participants) than in the placebo group (14 217 [62·3%] of 22 802 participants), with an OR of 0·92 (95% CI 0·86-0·99; 37 studies; I2=35·6%, pheterogeneity=0·018). No significant effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of having one or more ARIs was observed for any of the subgroups defined by baseline 25(OH)D concentration. However, protective effects of supplementation were observed in trials in which vitamin D was given in a daily dosing regimen (OR 0·78 [95% CI 0·65-0·94]; 19 studies; I2=53·5%, pheterogeneity=0·003), at daily dose equivalents of 400-1000 IU (0·70 [0·55-0·89]; ten studies; I2=31·2%, pheterogeneity=0·16), for a duration of 12 months or less (0·82 [0·72-0·93]; 29 studies; I2=38·1%, pheterogeneity=0·021), and to participants aged 1·00-15·99 years at enrolment (0·71 [0·57-0·90]; 15 studies; I2=46·0%, pheterogeneity=0·027). No significant interaction between allocation to the vitamin D supplementation group versus the placebo group and dose, dose frequency, study duration, or age was observed. In addition, no significant difference in the proportion of participants who had at least one serious adverse event in the vitamin supplementation group compared with the placebo group was observed (0·97 [0·86-1·07]; 36 studies; I2=0·0%, pheterogeneity=0·99). Risk of bias within individual studies was assessed as being low for all but three trials. INTERPRETATION Despite evidence of significant heterogeneity across trials, vitamin D supplementation was safe and overall reduced the risk of ARI compared with placebo, although the risk reduction was small. Protection was associated with administration of daily doses of 400-1000 IU for up to 12 months, and age at enrolment of 1·00-15·99 years. The relevance of these findings to COVID-19 is not known and requires further investigation.

We describe our centre's experience of these complications from 2007 to 2019. Ninety-six patients received 103 transplants. PLS occurred in 9 (9%) patients (median 12 days post-transplant); all due to ABO antibodies. There were 31 minor ABO mismatch transplants. No patient required change in immunosuppression. Immune cytopenias (excluding PLS) occurred in six patients at an incidence of 1·7/100 patient years; three immune haemolysis, one immune thrombocytopenia, one acquired Glanzmann's and one immune neutropenia; 50% occurred with other cytopenias. All cases eventually responded to treatment, with a median of four treatments (range 1-8) and 5/6 were treated with rituximab. One patient with immune haemolysis required bortezomib. Complications were common in patients with immune cytopenias; 4/6 with infection needing intravenous antibiotics and 3/6 with venous thromboembolism. In 3/6 cases, a secondary cause for the immune cytopenia was evident. Switching from tacrolimus to ciclosporin was not necessary. There were five cases of transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA; 1·5/100 patient years) requiring calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal; two cases associated with acute rejection. Two cases were managed with plasma exchange, one with plasma infusions and one with eculizumab.

Using nationally-representative, longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (1994-2008) (n = 9029), the present study uses a combination of analytic methods-including prospective lagged dependent variable regression models, inverse probabilities of treatment weighting, longitudinal first difference models, causal mediation techniques-to comprehensively assess whether and how evictions relate to depressive risk and self-rated health across early adulthood, paying particular attention to the stress-related pathways linking eviction and health. Results provide robust evidence of positive longitudinal associations between eviction and depressive risk, in particular. In the prospective regression models, young adults who experienced recent eviction had more depressive symptoms and worse self-rated health than those who were not evicted, net a host of background characteristics. Using treatment weighting techniques, results showed that young adults who experienced eviction had more depressive symptoms than those who were not evicted (5.921 vs. 4.998 depressive symptoms, p = 0.003). Perceived social stress mediated nearly 18 percent of the associations between eviction and the depressive symptoms (p < 0.001). In the first difference models, young people who experienced eviction between survey waves experienced greater increases in depressive symptoms over time compared to those who were not evicted, net of changes in other indicators of socioeconomic status and residential instability. Taken together, our results suggest that the recent surges in evictions in the U.S. serve as a potent threat to population health during the emerging adult period, with especially devastating consequences for low-income individuals and communities of color.","Hoke, Morgan K; Boen, Courtney E",Social science & medicine,169,1

Manual hyperinflation (MHI) and ventilator hyperinflation (VHI) may restore EELV post-ES but it remains unknown which method is most effective. The primary aim was to compare the efficacy of MHI and VHI in restoring EELV post-ES. MATERIALS AND METHODS ES was performed on mechanically ventilated intensive care patients, followed by MHI or VHI, in a randomised crossover design. The washout period between interventions was 1 h. End-expiratory lung impedance (EELI), measured by electrical impedance tomography, was recorded at baseline, during ES, during hyperinflation and 1, 5, 15 and 30 min post-hyperinflation. RESULTS Nine participants were studied. ES decreased EELI by 1672z (95% CI, 1204 to 2140) from baseline. From baseline, MHI increased EELI by 1154z (95% CI, 977 to 1330) while VHI increased EELI by 769z (95% CI, 457 to 1080). Five minutes post-VHI, EELI remained 528z (95% CI, 4 to 1053) above baseline. Fifteen minutes post-MHI, EELI remained 351z (95% CI, 111 to 592) above baseline. At subsequent time-points, EELI returned to baseline. CONCLUSIONS MHI and VHI effectively restore EELV above baseline post-ES and should be considered post suctioning.","Linnane, Matthew P; Caruana, Lawrence R; Tronstad, Oystein; Corley, Amanda; Spooner, Amy J; Barnett, Adrian G; Thomas, Peter J; Walsh, James R",Journal of critical care,169,30

Initiator titration occurs predominantly at the datA locus that binds exceptionally large amounts of DnaA molecules to prevent aberrant initiations. We found that this was enabled by integration host factor (IHF). Within datA, there is a consensus IHF recognition sequence between the two DnaA recognition sequences (DnaA boxes) essential for its function. Binding of IHF to this site was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Disruption of the core sequence in the consensus of the IHF-binding resulted in increased origin concentration as observed in Delta datA cells. Furthermore, the number of DnaA molecules bound to datA was reduced in cells carrying a disruption in the IHF-binding core sequence. The IHF-binding site and the essential DnaA boxes had to be located at a proper distance and orientation to maintain the accurate initiation timing. Therefore, IHF is a unique element in the control of replication initiation that acts negatively at datA, while known to act as a positive regulator at oriC.","Nozaki, Shingo; Yamada, Yoshitaka; Ogawa, Tohru",Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,169,24

As a result, biologically implausible outcomes were given equal weight as the principles set by decades of viral immunology. Unsurprisingly, questionable results and alarmist news media articles have filled the void. We suggest an emphasis on setting expectations based on prior findings while avoiding the overused approach of assuming nothing.

We analyzed outcomes and treatment strategies of tandem occlusion patients in the ESCAPE-NA1 trial. METHODS ESCAPE-NA1 was a multicenter international randomized trial of nerinetide versus placebo in 1105 patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent endovascular treatment. We defined tandem occlusions as complete occlusion of the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) on catheter angiography, in addition to a proximal ipsilateral intracranial large vessel occlusion. Baseline characteristics and outcome parameters were compared between patients with tandem occlusions versus those without, and between patients with tandem occlusion who underwent ICA stenting versus those who did not. The influence of tandem occlusions on functional outcome was analyzed using multivariable regression modeling. RESULTS Among 115/1105 patients (10.4%) with tandem occlusions, 62 (53.9%) received stenting for the cervical ICA occlusion. Of these, 46 (74.2%) were stented after and 16 (25.8%) before the intracranial thrombectomy. A modified Rankin Score (mRS) of 0-2 at 90 days was achieved in 82/115 patients (71.3%) with tandem occlusions compared with 579/981 (59.5%) patients without tandem occlusions. Tandem occlusion did not impact functional outcome in the adjusted analysis (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.4). Among the subgroup of patients with tandem occlusion, cervical carotid stenting was not associated with different outcomes compared with no stenting (mRS 0-2: 75.8% vs 66.0%, adjusted OR 2.0, 95% CI 0.8 to 5.1). CONCLUSIONS Tandem cervical carotid occlusion in patients with acute large vessel stroke did not lower the odds of good functional outcome in our study. Functional outcomes were similar irrespective of the management of the cervical ICA occlusion (stenting vs not stenting).","Marko, Martha; Cimflova, Petra; Poppe, Alexandre Y; Kashani, Nima; Singh, Nishita; Ospel, Johanna; Mayank, Arnuv; van Adel, Brian; McTaggart, Ryan A; Nogueira, Raul G; Demchuk, Andrew M; Rempel, Jeremy L; Joshi, Manish; Zerna, Charlotte; Menon, Bijoy K; Tymianski, Michael; Hill, Michael D; Goyal, Mayank; Almekhlafi, Mohammed A",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,169,1

Telehealth may be an alternative way to follow these patients remotely. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of telehealth in the management of patients with AIH. The COVID-19 outbreak during the study period provided an opportunity to evaluate any pandemic influence on how telehealth was perceived by patients and physicians. METHODS We included patients with AIH who were followed in the Harran University hospital, Turkey. Patients were managed by either remote telehealth or standard care. The clinical courses of these two groups were compared. RESULTS A total of 46 (telehealth, n=19 and standard care, n= 27) patients (40 female) with a median age of 32 (range 17-74) years at diagnosis were included in the study. Until the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 11, 2020), the rates of biochemical remission and relapse after remission were similar in the telehealth and standard care groups (89.5% vs. 89.1% and 15.8% vs. 25.9%, p=ns, for both). The telehealth group maintained remission significantly better than the standard care group (100% vs. 77.3%, p=0.035) during the COVID-19 period. All relapses were due to non-adherence to therapy. Psychiatric problems, pregnancy related issues and drug side-effects could all be managed remotely by telehealth. CONCLUSIONS In this study, we show for the first time that telehealth is a feasible alternative for managing AIH, both under normal circumstances and during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Efe, Cumali; Simşek, Cem; Batıbay, Ersin; Calışkan, Ali Rıza; Wahlin, Staffan",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,169,5

Current rates of EVD-related infections range from 2% to 45% in the literature. The authors sought to determine if a 2-octyl cyanoacrylate adhesive would result in lower infection rate than standard semiocclusive dressings. METHODS The authors tracked ventriculitis rates via CSF cultures among 259 patients whose EVD sites were dressed with sterile semiocclusive dressings and underwent routine sterile dressing exchanges every 48 hours. They analyzed data obtained in an additional 113 patients whose EVD sites were dressed one time with a surgical adhesive, 2-octyl cyanoacrylate. RESULTS Ventriculitis rate in patients with standard bioocclusive dressings and wound care was 15.1%, whereas that in patients with a 2-octyl cyanoacrylate dressing was 3.54% (p = 0.002). Staphylococcus genus accounted for 79.5% of instances of ventriculitis among patients with bioocclusive dressings and routine wound care, whereas it accounted for 25.0% of the instances of ventriculitis among patients with a liquid polymer sealant dressing. A 90% reduction in Staphylococcus infection completely accounts for the observed effect (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS The one-time application of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate to EVD wounds and exit sites provided superior protection against EVD-related ventriculitis compared to conventional EVD-site wound care. Likely this protection results from a barrier to the entry of gram-positive skin flora along the EVD exit tract.

METHODS 251 aneurysms were first treated with coiling (embolization). 203 patients were followed up with conventional angiography for 6-8 months after the initial treatment and 182 were followed up with three-dimensional time of flight MR angiography at 18-24 months. Postoperative and mid-term anatomical results were evaluated anonymously and independently using the modified Montreal Scale. RESULTS The initial rate of complete occlusion was 70.9%, with rates of neck remnants and aneurysm remants of 18.3% and 10.7%, respectively. The recurrence rate was 13% after 6 months and 2% between 6 months and 2 years. The rate of retreatment was 11%. Statistically, the variables that were found to be related to the initial degree of occlusion were the use of a remodeling balloon technique (p=0.012), the size of the aneurysm neck (p=0.044) and the size of the aneurysm (p=0.004). The recanalization rate at mid-term depended on the size of the aneurysm. Although aneurysms with partial occlusion initially tended to evolve to a worse degree of closure than those with complete occlusion initially, the relationship was not statistically significant (p=0.110). CONCLUSIONS Embolized aneurysms can develop a worse degree of closure even when the initial occlusion is complete. The degree of occlusion depends directly on morphological factors and the use of balloon-assisted techniques. The recanalization rate at mid-term depends on the size of the aneurysm and probably on the density of the packing achieved with the initial treatment.","Murias Quintana, Eduardo; Gil Garcia, Alberto; Vega Valdés, Pedro; Cuellar, Hugo; Meilán Martínez, Ángela; Saiz Ayala, Antonio; Costilla Garcia, Serafin; Escudero Augusto, Dolores; Gutierrez Morales, Julio Cesar; López García, Antonio",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,169,1

Therefore, according to the Theory of Planned Behavior, the psychosocial precursors of correct sanitation and sanitization were assessed. METHODS An Italian sample of hospital health workers (nurses, healthcare assistants, cleaners; N=250), replied to a validated questionnaire measuring: a) knowledge of HAI; b) favorable attitude towards the correct sanitation and sanitization procedure; c) perception that the management and colleagues give importance to the government of infectious risk; d) perception of being able to implement risk management behaviors; e) perception of having received proper training for the prevention of HAI. RESULTS The results show many mistakes about knowledge, the perception of insufficient specific training, and not always favorable attitude towards sanitation and sanitization practices. Workers also perceive that they can act the required behaviors and that the management of infectious risk represents a value in the group they belong to, but they believe that the management does not offer sufficient support. CONCLUSIONS The improvement of the factors considered (knowledge, personal attitudes, actions of management and colleagues, perception of being able to implement the required behaviors) is affected by proper training.

RESULTS Both patients developed eye redness 3 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Slit lamp examination showed bilateral acute follicular conjunctivitis, which was resolved within 6 days. RT-PCR demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in conjunctival specimens from both eyes, which was unrelated to viral RNA from throat swabs. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 may cause ocular manifestations such as viral conjunctivitis. Conjunctival sampling may be useful for infected patients with conjunctivitis and fever. Precautionary measures are recommended when examining infected patients throughout the clinical course of the infection.","Lim, Louis W; Tan, Glorijoy S; Yong, Vernon; Anderson, Danielle E; Lye, David C; Young, Barnaby; Agrawal, Rupesh",Ocular immunology and inflammation,169,1

Strikingly, some of the functions of the ER are exploited by viruses to promote their life cycles. During entry, viruses must penetrate a host membrane and reach an intracellular destination to express and replicate their genomes. These events lead to the assembly of new viral progenies that exit the host cell, thereby initiating further rounds of infection. In this review, we highlight how three distinct viruses - polyomavirus, flavivirus, and coronavirus - co-opt key functions of the ER to cause infection. We anticipate that illuminating this virus-ER interplay will provide rational therapeutic approaches to combat the virus-induced diseases.","Chen, Yu-Jie; Bagchi, Parikshit; Tsai, Billy",Biochemical Society transactions,169,25

METHODS Forty-five COPD patients were included in this study where they allocated in three-groups (nasal-delivery, oral-delivery, and oronasal-delivery groups) All patients were received their inhaled-salbutamol dose using Aerogon Solo nebulizer by one of three interfaces e.g. nasal-cannula, mouthpiece, and facemask in two conditions; with oxygen-flow and without any oxygen-flow. Pulmonary and systemic salbutamol deposition was estimated through collecting two urine-samples from the patient; 30min post-inhalation and cumulatively 24h post-inhalation. The quantity of salbutamol in these collected samples was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Lung function measurement was performed pre-bronchodilator inhalation and 30 min post-bronchodilator to estimate the change in pulmonary functions post-inhalation regarding all tested interfaces. RESULTS COPD patients showed the highest salbutamol percentage excreted 30 min post-inhalation of 5.7% (1.4) with mouthpiece interface when combined with oxygen at p<0.002. While with the same condition using oxygen, valved-facemask showed the highest salbutamol percentage excreted in 24 h post inhalation samples but the difference is only significantly compared to nasal cannula (p<0.006).On the other hand without oxygen delivery, mouthpiece and valved facemask showed approximately the same salbutamol percentage excreted in 30 min post-inhalation samples, higher than that delivered by nasal cannula (p<0.001). Of note, salbutamol delivery is significantly increased with oxygen flow for all interfaces (p<0.05) except with nasal cannula. CONCLUSIONS The nasal cannula is a more comfortable and tolerable interface despite the lower fraction of the delivered drug compared to other tested interfaces. The use of oxygen-flow with aerosol delivery within a high flow system positively affects the delivered drug fraction and the pulmonary deposition of the drug.","Madney, Yasmin M; Ibrahim Laz, Nabila; Elberry, Ahmed A; Rabea, Hoda; Abdelrahim, Mohamed E A",International journal of clinical practice,169,26

Effectiveness was measured by: (a) reduction in the number of patients admitted into the MERS-CoV tracking system; (b) identification of positive MERS-CoV cases; (c) containment of cross infectivity; and (d) increased efficiency in ED functioning. METHODS A retrospective chart review was carried out of all ED patients suspected of MERS-CoV during the height of the epidemic (August to October 2013). An algorithm was created on the basis of international guidelines to screen and triage suspected MERS-CoV patients. Once identified, patients were isolated, had a chest roentgenogram [chest radiography (CXR)] taken, and a nasopharyngeal swab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was sent with sputum samples for testing. Patients with normal CXR and mild respiratory symptoms were discharged with home isolation instructions until nasopharyngeal and sputum PCR results were available. Patients with fever and acute respiratory distress, with or without abnormal CXR, were treated in the hospital until tests proved negative for MERS-CoV. RESULTS The protocol successfully reduced the number of patients who needed to be tested for MERS-CoV from 12,563 to 514, identified seven positive cases, and did not lead to apparent cross infectivity that resulted in serious illness or death. The protocol also increased the efficiency of ED and cut the turnaround time for nasopharyngeal swab and sputum results from 3 days to 1 day. CONCLUSION A highly protocolized surveillance system limited the impact of MERS-CoV on ED functioning by identifying and prioritizing high-risk patients. The emergence of new infectious diseases requires constant monitoring of interventions to reduce the impact of epidemics on population health and health services.","Varughese, Shinu; Read, Jennan G; Al-Khal, Abdullatif; Abo Salah, Salem; El Deeb, Yasser; Cameron, Peter A",European journal of emergency medicine : official journal of the European Society for Emergency Medicine,169,23

To meet patient specific capabilities, injection forces need to be characterized. We address the open question of whether tissue resistance significantly contributes to overall injection forces, especially for large injection volumes. METHODS Subcutaneous tissue resistance was systematically quantified for injection volumes up to 11 mL depending on viscosity (1-20 mPa·s) and injection rates (0.025-0.2 mL/s) using Göttingen Minipigs as the animal model. The contribution of an artificially applied external force at the injection site simulating autoinjector needle cover depression was tested between 2.5-7.5 N. RESULTS Tissue resistance reached average values of ~120 mbar for injection volumes up to 11 mL independent of viscosity and injection rate, and maximum values of 300 mbar were determined. Artificially applied external forces led to higher values, independent of the absolute applied force - maximum values of 1 bar were obtained when injecting 4.5 mL of the 20 mPa·s solution at an injection rate of 0.1 mL/s with the application of an artificial 5 N force, corresponding to ~450 mbar. All conditions yield defined injection sites suggesting tissue resistance is defined by mechanical properties of the subcutaneous tissue. CONCLUSIONS We set our results in relation to overall injection forces, concluding that maximum values in tissue resistance may cause challenges during subcutaneous injection when using injection devices.

Clinicians and public health experts should be aware of emerging infectious causes of encephalitis, mechanisms by which they are transmitted, and clinical manifestations of disease. RECENT FINDINGS A number of arthropod-borne viral infections -- transmitted chiefly by mosquitoes and ticks -- have emerged in recent years to cause outbreaks of encephalitis. Examples include Powassan virus in North America, Chikungunya virus in Central and South America, and tick-borne encephalitis virus in Europe. Many of these viruses exhibit complex life cycles and can infect multiple host animals in addition to humans. Factors thought to influence emergence of these diseases, including changes in climate and land use, are also believed to underlie the emergence of the rickettsial bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, now recognized as a major causative agent of acute encephalitis syndrome in South Asia. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the role of bats as carriers of viruses. Recent studies have begun to uncover mechanisms by which the immune systems of bats are poised to allow for viral tolerance. Several bat-borne infections, including Nipah virus and Ebola virus, have resulted in recent outbreaks of encephalitis. SUMMARY Infectious causes of encephalitis continue to emerge worldwide, in part because of climate change and human impacts on the environment. Expansion of surveillance measures will be critical in rapid diagnosis and limiting of outbreaks in the future.","Venkatesan, Arun",Current opinion in neurology,169,29

Brain function monitoring such as the bispectral index (BIS) facilitates anesthetic titration and has been shown to reduce anesthetic exposure. In a randomized controlled trial, we tested the effect of BIS monitoring on POCD in 921 elderly patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery. METHODS Patients were randomly assigned to receive either BIS-guided anesthesia or routine care. The BIS group had anesthesia adjusted to maintain a BIS value between 40 and 60 during maintenance of anesthesia. Routine care group had BIS measured but not revealed to attending anesthesiologists. Anesthesia was adjusted according to traditional clinical signs and hemodynamic parameters. A neuropsychology battery of tests was administered before and at 1 week and 3 months after surgery. Results were compared with matched control patients who did not have surgery during the same period. Delirium was measured using the confusion assessment method criteria. RESULTS The median (interquartile range) BIS values during the maintenance period of anesthesia were significantly lower in the control group, 36 (31 to 49), compared with the BIS-guided group, 53 (48 to 57), P<0.001. BIS-guided anesthesia reduced propofol delivery by 21% and that for volatile anesthetics by 30%. There were fewer patients with delirium in the BIS group compared with routine care (15.6% vs. 24.1%, P=0.01). Although cognitive performance was similar between groups at 1 week after surgery, patients in the BIS group had a lower rate of POCD at 3 months compared with routine care (10.2% vs. 14.7%; adjusted odds ratio 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.98; P=0.025). CONCLUSIONS BIS-guided anesthesia reduced anesthetic exposure and decreased the risk of POCD at 3 months after surgery. For every 1000 elderly patients undergoing major surgery, anesthetic delivery titrated to a range of BIS between 40 and 60 would prevent 23 patients from POCD and 83 patients from delirium.","Chan, Matthew T V; Cheng, Benny C P; Lee, Tatia M C; Gin, Tony",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,169,27

As a protective factor, sense of coherence (SOC) may play a role to reduce some psychological discomfort. This study aimed to analyze the relationships of SOC with anxiety, digital health literacy (DHL), information, and financial satisfaction among older adults during the outbreak. Methods: This is part of a large-scale DHL study with a cross-sectional survey across 41 countries. This study extracted data from three Asian countries (China, the Philippines, and Singapore) and included people aged ≥60. Structural equation modeling with path analysis was utilized to examine the relationships of SOC with anxiety about the future and other variables. Results: A total of 266 older adults were included, with 43.2% expressed anxiety about the future. DHL (β=-0.13, p < 0.05) and SOC (β=-0.26, p = 0.01) were negatively associated with anxiety, while financial and information satisfaction were not. However, financial satisfaction (β = 0.34, p < 0.01) and DHL (β = 0.32, p = 0.01) were positively associated with SOC. Higher SOC further mediated the negative relationships of DHL (β= -0.11, p = 0.004) and financial satisfaction (β= -0.12, p = 0.004) on anxiety of older adults. Conclusions: SOC had direct negative effect on anxiety and mediated the relationships between anxiety and DHL/financial satisfaction. Strategies should be developed to enhance SOC and DHL among older adults, as these capacities may help to manage anxiety during the pandemic.","Leung, Angela Yee Man; Parial, Laurence Lloyd; Tolabing, Ma Carmen; Sim, Timothy; Mo, Phoenix; Okan, Orkan; Dadaczynski, Kevin",Aging & mental health,169,1

However, CNOP is known to be a heterogeneous group of orofacial pain disorders, which can lead to different responses to iMCS. Therefore, this paper investigated (1) whether the effectiveness of iMCS is significantly different among different CNOP disorders and (2) whether other confounding factors can be impacting iMCS results in CNOP. A systematic review and meta-analysis using a linear mixed-model was performed. Twenty-three papers were included, totaling 140 CNOP patients. Heterogeneity of the studies showed to be 55.8%. A visual analogue scale (VAS) measured median pain relief of 66.5% (ranging from 0-100%) was found. Linear mixed-model analysis showed that patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia responded significantly more favorable to iMCS than patients suffering from dysfunctional pain syndromes (p = 0.030). Also, patients suffering from CNOP caused by (supra)nuclear lesions responded marginally significantly better to iMCS than patients suffering from CNOP due to trigeminal nerve lesions (p = 0.049). No other confounding factors were elucidated. This meta-analysis showed that patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia and patients suffering from (supra)nuclear lesions causing CNOP responded significantly more favorable than others on iMCS. No other confounding factors were found relevant.","Henssen, Dylan; Kurt, Erkan; van Walsum, Anne-Marie Van Cappellen; Kozicz, Tamas; van Dongen, Robert; Bartels, Ronald",Scientific reports,169,31

It also aimed to appraise the individual success rate and the magnitude of benefit following implantation. DESIGN A scoping review was conducted to identify English-language, peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2000 and 2018 assessing the outcomes of cochlear implantation in adults who received their first cochlear implant from 2000 onwards. To be included, studies had to report speech perception or self-reported measures of listening or quality of life at least three months after implantation. Systematic searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Google Scholar. A two-stage screening approach was used, with seven reviewers independently screening titles and abstracts against inclusion criteria and three from this group further reviewing full-texts. A data charting form was developed and trialled, with 10% of the study data extracted in duplicate to compare results and further refine the form. Data relevant for efficacy analyses were extracted from studies with sample sizes of at least 10 participants. RESULTS A total of 4182 abstracts were screened against inclusion criteria, and of these, 603 full-texts were further screened. After exclusion of non-eligible articles, 201 articles were included in the first part of this scoping review. The majority of these articles were case series or comparative studies without a concurrent group, and had small sample sizes. Data synthesis conducted with the 102 articles with more than 10 participants highlighted that the average word perception ability improved from 8.2% to 53.9% after implantation. Self-reported benefit improved by 21.5 percentage points. At the individual level, 82.0% of adults with postlingual hearing loss and 53.4% of adults with prelingual hearing loss improved their speech perception ability by 15 percentage points or more. A small proportion had poorer ability after implantation or had stopped using the cochlear implant. CONCLUSIONS Despite broad inconsistencies in measurement, research design, and reporting across articles, it is evident that cochlear implantation is beneficial to the majority of adults of any age who have limited aided speech perception abilities. While many adults with severe-to-profound hearing loss may also have poor speech perception abilities with hearing aids, the validity of using hearing loss severity as a criterion for cochlear implantation has not been demonstrated. Clinical and research recommendations derived from this review are provided.","Boisvert, Isabelle; Reis, Mariana; Au, Agnes; Cowan, Robert; Dowell, Richard C",PloS one,169,1

The objective of this study was to characterize the correlation between device sizing, metal coverage, and the resultant occlusion of aneurysms following flow diverter treatment in a rabbit model. METHODS Rabbit saccular aneurysms were treated with flow diverters (iso-sized to proximal parent artery, 0.5 mm oversized, or 1.0 mm oversized, respectively, n=6 for each group). Eight weeks after implantation, the angiographic degree of aneurysm occlusion was graded (complete, near-complete, or incomplete). The ostium of the explanted aneurysm covered with the flow diverter struts was photographed. Based on gross anatomic findings, the metal coverage and pore density at the ostium of the aneurysm were calculated and correlated with the degree of aneurysm occlusion. RESULTS Angiographic results showed there were no statistically significant differences in aneurysm geometry and occlusion among groups. The mean parent artery diameter to flow diverter diameter ratio was higher in the 1.0 mm oversized group than in the other groups. Neither the percentage metal coverage nor the pore density showed statistically significant differences among groups. Aneurysm occlusion was inversely correlated with the ostium diameter, irrespective of the size of the device implanted. CONCLUSIONS Device sizing alone does not predict resultant pore density or metal coverage following flow diverter implantation in the rabbit aneurysm model. Aneurysm occlusion was not impacted by either metal coverage or pore density, but was inversely correlated with the diameter of the ostium.","Hodis, Simona; Ding, Yong-Hong; Dai, Daying; Lingineni, Ravi; Mut, Fernando; Cebral, Juan; Kallmes, David; Kadirvel, Ramanathan",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,169,1

Now, many rely on EHRs, informal emails, or texts, introducing fragmentation and new data security challenges with new communication strategies. We aimed to examine the impact of a physician champion educational outreach intervention to promote electronic provider-to-provider communication in a large academic multispecialty group. METHODS Physician champions provided educational outreach to 16 academic departments, using 10-minute case-based presentations. Online surveys assessed communication preferences and practices. Electronic health record queries counted EHR messaging use before and after intervention. Descriptive statistics compared responses by specialty (z-test). Paired responses with pre-post data were compared using chi-square tests. Time series analysis assessed EHR messaging rates before intervention versus after intervention. RESULTS Five hundred seventeen providers responded to the postoutreach survey. Eighty-six percent were familiar with EHR messaging tool and 78% knew how to use it after intervention. Among practitioner groups, Family Medicine preferred EHR messaging the most (62%). Groups who declined outreach least preferred it (26%). Among 88 respondents with paired pre-post intervention surveys, familiarity rose (79-96%), and self-reported use increased (66-88%).

Details of the infection process in the host have significant bearings on both recovery from the disease and on the correlates of the protection from the future exposures. One of these factors is the presence and titers of neutralizing Abs (NAbs) in infected people. In the current study, we set out to investigate NAbs in the recovered subjects discharged from the hospital in full health. Serum samples from a total of 49 documented consecutive COVID-19 subjects were included in the study. All the subjects were adults, and serum samples collected during the discharge were tested in viral neutralization, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and Western immunoblot tests against viral Ags. Even though a majority of the recovered subjects had raised significant NAb titers, there is a substantial number of recovered patients (10 out of 49) with no or low titers of NAbs against the virus. In these cohorts as well as in patients with high NAb titers, viral Ag binding Abs were detectable in EIA tests. Both NAb titers and EIA detectable Abs are increased in patients experiencing a severe form of the disease, and in older patients the Ab titers were heightened. The main conclusion is that the recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection is not solely dependent on high NAb titers in affected subjects, and this recovery process is probably produced by a complex interplay between many factors, including immune response, age of the subjects, and viral pathology.","Kalkan Yazıcı, Merve; Koç, Meliha Meric; Çetin, Nesibe Selma; Karaaslan, Elif; Okay, Gulay; Durdu, Bulent; Sümbül, Bilge; Doymaz, Mehmet Z",Journal of immunology,169,5

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with a high rate of mortality in patients with end stage renal disease and vaccination is hoped to prevent infection. Methods. Between January 18, and February 24, 2021, 225 kidney transplant recipients (KTR) and 45 hemodialysis patients (HDP) received two injections of mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. The post-vaccinal humoral and cellular response was explored in the first 45 KTR and 10 HDP. Results. After the second dose, 8 HDP (88.9%) and 8 KTR (17.8%) developed anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (p<0.0001). Median titer of antibodies in responders was 1052 AU/mL (IQR: 515-2689) in HDP and 671 AU/mL (IQR: 172-1523) in KTR (p=0.4). Nine HDP (100%) and 26 KTR (57.8%) showed a specific T cell response (p=0.06) after the second injection. In responders, median numbers of spike-reactive T cells were 305 SFC/106 CD3+ T cells (IQR: 95-947) in HDP and 212 SFC/106 CD3+ T cells (IQR: 61-330) in KTR (p=0.4). In KTR, the immune response to BNT162b2 seemed influenced by the immunosuppressive regimen, particularly tacrolimus or belatacept. Conclusion. Immunization with BNT162b2 seems more efficient in HDP, indicating that vaccination should be highly recommended in these patients awaiting a transplant. However, the current vaccinal strategy for KTR may not provide effective protection against COVID-19 and will likely need to be improved.","Bertrand, Dominique; Hamzaoui, Mouad; Lemée, Veronique; Lamulle, Julie; Hanoy, Melanie; Laurent, Charlotte; Lebourg, Ludivine; Etienne, Isabelle; Lemoine, Mathilde; Le Roy, Frank; Nezam, Dorian; Plantier, Jean-Christophe; Boyer, Olivier; Guerrot, Dominique; Candon, Sophie",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,169,11

Materials and Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing ADMG to SCTG for the treatment of Miller Class I and II recession defects was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched up to March 2016 for controlled trials with minimum 6 months duration. The primary outcome was root coverage; secondary outcomes included attachment level change, keratinized tissue (KT) change, and patient-based outcomes. Both authors independently assessed the quality of each included trial and extracted the relevant data. Results From 158 potential titles, 17 controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. There were no differences between ADMG and SCTG for mean root coverage, percent root coverage, and clinical attachment level gain.

When produced at optimal levels ROS have potent antimicrobial properties. However, excessive production of ROS induces apoptosis/necrosis of infected as well as bystander cells, resulting in inflammatory pathology. Previously we showed that vaccination of pigs with a modified live porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus vaccine (PRRS-MLV) administered intranasally with a potent mucosal adjuvant M. tuberculosis whole-cell lysate (Mtb WCL) induces protective immunity against PRRSV challenge. In this study, using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested from that study were quantified for the levels of ROS produced. Our results indicated that in vaccinated pigs, levels of ROS were lower compared to unvaccinated PRRSV-challenged pigs. In unvaccinated but PRRSV-challenged pigs, the higher ROS production was associated with increased inflammatory lung pathology. In conclusion, our results suggest that intranasal immunization using PRRS-MLV along with a potent mucosal adjuvant protects pigs against both homologous and virulent heterologous PRRSV challenge, which was associated with reduced ROS production and reduced lung pathology compared to control virus-challenged pigs.","Binjawadagi, Basavaraj; Dwivedi, Varun; Manickam, Cordelia; Torrelles, Jordi B; Renukaradhya, Gourapura J",Viral immunology,169,1

However, totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy (TLTG) with intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy (IE) is still uncommon because of technical difficulties. Herein, we evaluated various types of IE after TLTG in terms of the technical aspects. We compared the short-term operative outcomes between TLTG with IE and laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG) with extracorporeal esophagojejunostomy (EE). METHODS Between March 2006 and December 2014, a total of 213 patients with gastric cancer underwent TLTG and LATG. Overall, 92 patients underwent TLTG with IE, and 121 patients underwent LATG with EE. Generally, there are two methods of IE: mechanical staplers (circular or linear staplers) and hand-sewn sutures. Surgical efficiencies and outcomes were compared between two groups. We also described various types of IE using a subgroup analysis. RESULTS The mean operation times were similar in the two groups, as was the number of retrieved lymph nodes. However, the mean estimated blood loss of TLTG was statistically lower than LATG. There were no significant differences in time to first flatus, the time to restart oral intake, the length of the hospital stay after operation, and postoperative complications. Four types of IE have been applied after TLTG, including 42 cases of hand-sewn IE. The overall mean operation time and the mean anastomotic time in TLTG were 279.5 ± 38.4 min and 52.6 ± 18.9 min respectively. There was no case of conversion to open procedure. Postoperative complication occurred in 16 patients (17.4%) and no postoperative mortality occurred. CONCLUSIONS IE is a feasible procedure and can be safely performed for TLTG with the proper laparoscopic expertise. It is technically feasible to perform hand-sewn IE after TLTG, which can reduce the cost of the laparoscopic procedure.","Chen, Ke; He, Yang; Cai, Jia-Qin; Pan, Yu; Wu, Di; Chen, Ding-Wei; Yan, Jia-Fei; Maher, Hendi; Mou, Yi-Ping",BMC surgery,169,32

In contrast, it is largely unknown whether host cell proteases located in the secretory pathway of infected cells and/or on the surface of target cells can cleave SARS S. We along with others could previously show that the type II transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 activates the influenza virus hemagglutinin and the human metapneumovirus F protein by cleavage. Here, we assessed whether SARS S is proteolytically processed by TMPRSS2. Western blot analysis revealed that SARS S was cleaved into several fragments upon coexpression of TMPRSS2 (cis-cleavage) and upon contact between SARS S-expressing cells and TMPRSS2-positive cells (trans-cleavage). cis-cleavage resulted in release of SARS S fragments into the cellular supernatant and in inhibition of antibody-mediated neutralization, most likely because SARS S fragments function as antibody decoys. trans-cleavage activated SARS S on effector cells for fusion with target cells and allowed efficient SARS S-driven viral entry into targets treated with a lysosomotropic agent or a cathepsin inhibitor. Finally, ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV, and TMPRSS2 were found to be coexpressed by type II pneumocytes, which represent important viral target cells, suggesting that SARS S is cleaved by TMPRSS2 in the lung of SARS-CoV-infected individuals. In summary, we show that TMPRSS2 might promote viral spread and pathogenesis by diminishing viral recognition by neutralizing antibodies and by activating SARS S for cell-cell and virus-cell fusion.","Glowacka, Ilona; Bertram, Stephanie; Müller, Marcel A; Allen, Paul; Soilleux, Elizabeth; Pfefferle, Susanne; Steffen, Imke; Tsegaye, Theodros Solomon; He, Yuxian; Gnirss, Kerstin; Niemeyer, Daniela; Schneider, Heike; Drosten, Christian; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Journal of virology,169,8

Most rabies modeling has focused on disease dynamics and control within terrestrial mammals (e.g., raccoons and foxes). As such, rabies in bats has been largely neglected until recently. Because bats have been implicated as natural reservoirs for several emerging zoonotic viruses, including SARS-like corona viruses, henipaviruses, and lyssaviruses, understanding how pathogens are maintained within a population becomes vital. Unfortunately, little is known about maintenance mechanisms for any pathogen in bat populations. We present a mathematical model parameterized with unique data from an extensive study of rabies in a Colorado population of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) to elucidate general maintenance mechanisms. We propose that life history patterns of many species of temperate-zone bats, coupled with sufficiently long incubation periods, allows for rabies virus maintenance. Seasonal variability in bat mortality rates, specifically low mortality during hibernation, allows long-term bat population viability. Within viable bat populations, sufficiently long incubation periods allow enough infected individuals to enter hibernation and survive until the following year, and hence avoid an epizootic fadeout of rabies virus. We hypothesize that the slowing effects of hibernation on metabolic and viral activity maintains infected individuals and their pathogens until susceptibles from the annual birth pulse become infected and continue the cycle. This research provides a context to explore similar host ecology and viral dynamics that may explain seasonal patterns and maintenance of other bat-borne diseases.","George, Dylan B; Webb, Colleen T; Farnsworth, Matthew L; O'Shea, Thomas J; Bowen, Richard A; Smith, David L; Stanley, Thomas R; Ellison, Laura E; Rupprecht, Charles E",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,169,26

The relationship between DCPs and asthma is well documented but questions remain regarding specific causal agents. Beyond asthma, associations between DCPs and COPD or chronic rhinitis are plausible and have been examined recently. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent advances on the effect of occupational exposure to DCP and chronic airway diseases. RECENT FINDINGS Recent epidemiological studies have often focused on healthcare workers and are characterized by efforts to improve assessment of exposure to specific DCPs. Despite increasing knowledge on the effect of DCPs on asthma, the burden of work-related asthma caused by DCPs has not decreased in the past decade, emphasizing the need to strengthen prevention efforts. Novel data suggest an association between occupational exposure to DCPs and other chronic airway diseases, such as rhinitis, COPD, and poor lung function. SUMMARY Epidemiological and experimental data showed that many chemicals contained in DCPs are likely to cause airway damage, indicating that prevention strategies should target multiple products. Further research is needed to evaluate the impact of DCP exposure on occupational airway diseases beyond asthma.","Dumas, Orianne",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,169,16

Thus, in vitro or ex vivo anatomical models offer an interesting alternative if limitations are clearly identified and if extrapolation to human is made with caution. This work aimed to develop an ex vivo infant-like respiratory model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia easy to use, reliable and relevant compared to in vivo infant data. This model is composed of a 3D-printed head connected to a sealed enclosure containing a leporine thorax. Physiological data and pleural-mimicking depressions were measured for chosen respiratory rates. Homogeneity of ventilation was assessed by 81mkrypton scintigraphies. Regional radioaerosol deposition was quantified with 99mtechnetium-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid after jet nebulization. Tidal volumes values are ranged from 33.16 ± 7.37 to 37.44 ± 7.43 mL and compliance values from 1.78 ± 0.65 to 1.85 ± 0.99 mL/cmH2O. Ventilation scintigraphies showed a homogenous ventilation with asymmetric repartition: 56.94% ± 9.4% in right lung and 42.83% ± 9.36 in left lung. Regional aerosol deposition in lungs exerted 2.60% ± 2.24% of initial load of radioactivity. To conclude the anatomical model satisfactorily mimic a 3-months old BPD-suffering bronchopulmonary dysplasia and can be an interesting tool for aerosol regional deposition studies.","Montigaud, Yoann; Périnel, Sophie; Dubus, Jean-Christophe; Leclerc, Lara; Suau, Marie; Goy, Clémence; Clotagatide, Anthony; Prévôt, Nathalie; Pourchez, Jérémie",Scientific reports,169,31

The possibility that there could be a differential effect on rehabilitation services relates to: the risk of familial/parental exposure leading to secondary infection, the negative economic impact of public health measures required to control disease spread, and the pre-existing social factors that impact access to healthcare. Finally, the psychosocial stresses imposed by COVID-19 inflame risk factors for non-accidental injury, which could lead to an increased need for pediatric rehabilitation services in vulnerable populations. It is critical that individual providers, as well as the health systems in which they practice, actively focus on mitigating personal and systemic causes of racial and ethnic health outcome disparities.

The need for social distancing and relaxing of federal and state telemental health regulations paved the way for widespread adoption of direct-to-consumer (DTC) ambulatory mental health video visits. METHODS We present cases that demonstrate the use of video visits across 6 clinical areas, each serving a unique population of patients, in a large behavioral health system. The benefits and limitations of this modality are illustrated in children, adults, and older adults with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, intellectual disability, substance use disorders, neurocognitive disorders, and schizophrenia. RESULTS Although telephone visits were acceptable and necessary to serve some patients, there are many advantages to video visits in providing best patient care. Education and support for telemental health-delivered to both patients and clinicians-is critical to the success of the DTC model. CONCLUSIONS DTC telemental health is a widespread clinical tool used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because this model has many strengths and advantages compared with traditional telemental health delivered in a clinic, regulators and insurers should be open to its continued use postpandemic when clinically appropriate.","Gannon, Jessica M; Schlesinger, Abigail; Glance, Jody; Sujata, Mandayam; Fredrick, Noreen; Wyler, James; Perez, Gina",Annals of clinical psychiatry : official journal of the American Academy of Clinical Psychiatrists,169,16

The impaired liver function increases the risks of invasive ICP monitoring, whereas noninvasive methods remain inadequate. The purpose of our study was to explore reliable noninvasive methods of neuromonitoring for patients with ALF in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting; more specifically, we wanted to track changes in HE and predict the outcomes of ALF patients treated with albumin dialysis. The study included 20 patients with severe ALF at admission who had been referred to the ICU of the liver transplantation (LT) center for albumin dialysis treatment and evaluation for transplantation. Data were collected from all study patients in the form of continuous frontal electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements of cerebral blood flow. Among the studied EEG variables, the 50% spectral edge frequency decreased and the delta power increased as the HE stage increased. Both variables were predictive of the stage of HE [prediction probability (PK) of 50% spectral edge frequency = 0.23, standard error (SE) = 0.03; PK of delta power = 0.76, SE = 0.03]. The total wavelet subband entropy, a novel variable that we used for tracking abnormal EEG activity, predicted the outcome of ALF patients treated with albumin dialysis (PK = 0.88, SE = 0.09). With a threshold value of 1.6, the TCD pulsatility index had an odds ratio of 1.1 (95% confidence interval = 0.1-9.3) for a poor outcome (LT or death). In conclusion, EEG variables are useful for the monitoring of HE and can be used to predict outcomes of ALF. TCD measurements do not predict patient outcomes.","Stewart, Juhani; Särkelä, Mika; Koivusalo, Anna-Maria; Wennervirta, Johanna; Salmi, Tapani; Isoniemi, Helena; Stenman, Ulf-Håkan; Viertiö-Oja, Hanna; Lapinlampi, Petteri; Lindgren, Leena; Salminen, Ulla-Stina; Vakkuri, Anne",Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,169,19

Acoustic assessment has the potential to provide critical, objective information during telepractice, yet its validity via telepractice is currently unknown. The current study investigated the accuracy of acoustic measures of voice in a variety of telepractice platforms. Method Twenty-nine voice samples from individuals with dysphonia were transmitted over six video conferencing platforms (Zoom with and without enhancements, Cisco WebEx, Microsoft Teams, Doxy.me, and VSee Messenger). Standard time-, spectral-, and cepstral-based acoustic measures were calculated. The effect of transmission condition on each acoustic measure was assessed using repeated-measures analyses of variance. For those acoustic measures for which transmission condition was a significant factor, linear regression analysis was performed on the difference between the original recording and each telepractice platform, with the overall severity of dysphonia, Internet speed, and ambient noise from the transmitter as predictors. Results Transmission condition was a statistically significant factor for all acoustic measures except for mean fundamental frequency (f o). Ambient noise from the transmitter was a significant predictor of differences between platforms and the original recordings for all acoustic measures except f o measures. All telepractice platforms affected acoustic measures in a statistically significantly manner, although the effects of platforms varied by measure. Conclusions Overall, measures of f o were the least impacted by telepractice transmission. Microsoft Teams had the least and Zoom (with enhancements) had the most pronounced effects on acoustic measures. These results provide valuable insight into the relative validity of acoustic measures of voice when collected via telepractice.

The purpose of this study is to describe the stenting technique and perioperative difficulties, as well as long-term outcome and complications with ureteral stenting in 12 cats with ureteroliths. Fifteen 2.5 Fr soft double pigtail multi-fenestrated ureteral stents were placed in an anterograde fashion under open surgical approaches and with fluoroscopic guidance in 12 cats. Nine cats received a unilateral stent and three received bilateral stents. Ureterotomy or ureteral resection and end-to-end anastomosis were performed in three and four cases, respectively. In six cats, papillotomy was performed to facilitate dilatator and stent placement. All cats recovered well from the surgical procedure, except one cat, which died during the anaesthesia recovery period. Postoperative complications included dysuria (three cases, diagnosed at 15 days, 1 month and 3 months, respectively), urinary tract infection (one case, 1 month after surgery), stent migration requiring stent replacement (one case, 19 months after surgery) and stent obstruction requiring stent removal (three cases with previously end-to-end anastomosis between 2 and 8 months after surgery). Nine cats (75%) were alive at a mean follow-up of 453 ± 194 (123-720) days. The median survival time was >415 days.

Following the network topological feature calculation and functional enrichment analysis, we found that the molecular targets and pathways related with the ""immune-inflammation system"" were involved throughout all the stages of COVID-19. The severe stage and the critical period of COVID-19 were occupied by a large proportion of inflammatory factors and pathways, suggesting that there might be a cytokine storm in these periods, along with respiratory disorders, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, nervous system disorders, etc. Accordingly, the therapeutic targets and pathways hit by the recommended prescriptions against COVID-19 were also aimed to regulate the balance of immune-inflammation system, nutrient absorption and metabolism, abnormal energy metabolism, the cardio-pulmonary function, nerve system function, etc., which may be related to the therapeutic effects of these prescriptions in terms of several clinical symptoms, such as expiratory dyspnea, chest tightness and shortness of breath, abdominal distension and constipation, sweating and limb cold, dizziness, and irritability, etc. The above findings reflect the integrative actions of TCM characterizing by multiple-components, multiple-targets, multiple-pathways, and multiple-effects.

We undertook this study to estimate the pooled prevalence of rectovaginal GBS colonization among pregnant women 35-40-week gestation in Nicaragua, and sensitivity of GBS isolates to various antibiotics. Methods: We systematically searched electronic databases of peer-reviewed and unpublished literature using prespecified search terms. We included English- and Spanish-language studies of rectovaginal GBS colonization and/or antibiotic sensitivity of GBS isolates that followed internationally-recognized diagnostic standards, from various sites and years. Two reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed risk of study bias. We then meta-analyzed the pooled prevalence of rectovaginal GBS colonization and antibiotic sensitivity of GBS isolates.

In this study we used emergency medical services (EMS) call data from the Boston, Massachusetts, area to describe the association between patients' reluctance to call EMS for cardiac-related care and both excess out-of-hospital cardiac arrest incidence and related outcomes during the pandemic. During the initial COVID-19 wave, cardiac-related EMS calls decreased (-27.2 percent), calls with hospital transportation refusal increased (+32.5 percent), and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest incidence increased (+35.5 percent) compared with historical baselines. After the initial wave, although cardiac-related calls remained lower (-17.2 percent), out-of-hospital cardiac arrest incidence remained elevated (+24.8 percent) despite fewer COVID-19 infections and relaxed public health advisories. Throughout Boston's fourteen neighborhoods, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest incidence was significantly associated with decreased cardiac-related calls, but not with COVID-19 infection rates. These findings suggest that patients were reluctant to obtain emergency care. Efforts are needed to ensure that patients seek timely care both during and after the pandemic to reduce potentially avoidable excess cardiovascular disease deaths.","Sun, Christopher; Dyer, Sophia; Salvia, James; Segal, Laura; Levi, Retsef",Health affairs,169,27

In recent years, successful attempts to reduce the number of the traditionally used three ports have been reported. Specifically, two-port techniques, hybrid approaches, and single-port assisted techniques have been described. METHODS In this case series, the author describes for the first time a successful and uncomplicated true single-port appendectomy (TSPA) technique. Between July and December of 2007, 14 consecutive patients were assigned to undergo TSPA for presumed appendicitis at Yale-New Haven Hospital. The novel approach involves an innovative ""puppeteer technique,"" which uses a ""pulley"" in the form of an intraabdominally placed loop to the abdominal wall as an axle to elevate the appendix with a string. The thread is pulled by the surgeon extracorporeally, similar to a puppeteer moving the limbs of his or her puppets. RESULTS Of the 14 patients, 13 (8 women and 5 men) underwent a successful TSPA. One patient was converted to a two-port appendectomy. The average age of the patients was 37.5 years (range, 22-59 years), and the average body mass index (BMI) was 27.4 kg/m(2) (range, 19.4-39 kg/m(2)). The mean operative time was 87.5 min (range, 54-128 min). No major complications were observed. One minor postoperative complication occurred, involving urinary retention, which resolved within 24 h. CONCLUSIONS The novel ""puppeteer technique"" seems to be a safe and easily reproducible alternative to previous laparoscopic appendectomy techniques. It uses only one single 11-mm port without any additional skin incisions or transdermally traversing needles. It is performed entirely intracorporeally, resulting in presumably less postoperative pain and improved cosmesis. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to investigate this novel technique. The TSPA technique, the first of its kind in the treatment of appendicitis, minimizes the minimally invasive approach to a new level.","Roberts, Kurt Eric",Surgical endoscopy,169,14

While prior studies have demonstrated that MSPE content is variable and selectively positive, no prior work has evaluated the impact of the MSPE on the likelihood to invite (LTI) applicants for a residency interview. This study aimed to evaluate how information in the MSPE impacted LTI, with the hypothesis that changes in LTI would be relatively rare based on MSPE review alone. METHODS We conducted a prospective, observational study analyzing applications to three EM residency programs during the 2019-2020 match cycle. Reviewers assessed applications and rated the LTI on a five-point Likert scale where LTI was defined as follows: 1 = definitely no; 2 = probably no; 3 = unsure; 4 = probably yes; and 5 = definitely yes. The LTI was recorded before and after MSPE review. A change in LTI was considered meaningful when it changed the overall trajectory of the applicant's likelihood to receive an invitation to interview. RESULTS We reviewed a total of 877 applications with the LTI changing ≥1 point on the Likert scale 160 (18.2%) times. The LTI was meaningfully impacted in a minority of applications - 48 total (5.5 %, p< 0.01) - with only 1 (0.11%) application changing from 1 or 2 (definitely/probably no) to 4 or 5 (probably/definitely yes) and 34 (3.8%) changing from 3 (unsure) to 4 or 5 (probably/definitely yes). Thirteen (1.5%) applications changed from 4 or 5 (probably/definitely yes) to 3 (unsure or probably/definitely no). CONCLUSION Review of the MSPE resulted in a meaningful change in LTI in only 5.5% of applications. Given the time required for program leadership to review all parts of the variably formatted MSPEs, this finding supports a more efficient application review, where the PD's focus is on succinct and objective aspects of the application, such as the Standardized Letter of Evaluation.","Thimm, Terra N; Kiefer, Christopher S; Aloi, Mara S; Davenport, Moira; Kilpatrick, Jared; Bush, Jeffrey S; Jennings, Lindsey; Davis, Stephen M; Quedado, Kimberly; Shaver, Erica B",The western journal of emergency medicine,169,9

METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing single-port colorectal surgery were enrolled from 11 European centres between March 2010 and March 2014. Data were analysed to assess patient-, technique- and procedure-dependent parameters. A validated sex-adjusted risk chart was developed for prediction of single-port colorectal surgery-related conversion and complications. RESULTS Some 1769 patients were enrolled, 937 with benign and 832 with malignant conditions. Procedures were completed without additional trocars in 1628 patients (92·0 per cent). Conversion to open surgery was required in 75 patients (4·2 per cent) and was related to male sex and ASA fitness grade exceeding I. Conversions were more frequent in pelvic procedures involving the rectum compared with abdominal procedures (8·1 versus 3·2 per cent; odds ratio 2·69, P < 0·001). Postoperative complications were observed in a total of 224 patients (12·7 per cent). Independent predictors of complications included male sex (P < 0·001), higher ASA grade (P = 0·006) and rectal procedures (P = 0·002). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 0·5 per cent (8 of 1769 patients); three deaths (0·2 per cent; 1 blood loss, 2 leaks) were attributable to surgical causes.

Pregnant women are an important subgroup to study the health consequences due to physical inactivity since it can lead to adverse outcomes in pregnancy and even after delivery. Therefore, we aimed at understanding the level of physical activity among pregnant women, prevalence of prenatal and postnatal depressive symptoms and whether level of physical activity is associated with prenatal and postnatal depressive symptoms. METHODS In an ongoing cohort study, we measured the physical activity using a validated Physical Activity Level (PAL) questionnaire. We administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during pregnancy and within seven days of delivery to assess depressive symptoms in 1406 women. Associations were adjusted for potential confounders such as maternal age, education, socioeconomic status, gravida, EPDS score during pregnancy, social support, skinfold thickness, blood pressure, blood sugar level. RESULTS We found that 7.2% of pregnant women had low levels of physical activity. The prevalence of prenatal and postnatal depressive symptoms was 9.0% and 31.9% respectively. Pregnant women with a low level of physical activity had significantly higher odds of developing postpartum depressive symptoms (OR = 3.15, CI: 1.98-5.02, p < 0.001) when adjusted for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS Moderate level of physical activity among pregnant mothers is essential and has its association with postnatal depressive symptoms. Health care professionals need to counsel pregnant women to assess depressive symptoms at both the prenatal and postpartum period and inform them about the importance of the optimal level of physical activity.","Ana, Yamuna; Lewis, Melissa Glenda; van Schayck, Onno C P; Babu, Giridhara R",Journal of psychosomatic research,169,27

Aim of our study was to compare the clinical outcomes of octogenarians with ULMCA disease treated either with PCI with drug-eluting stents or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The primary study end point was the composite of death, cerebrovascular accident, and myocardial infarction at follow-up. A total of 304 consecutive patients with ULMCA stenosis treated with PCI or CABG and aged ≥80 years were selected and analyzed in a large multinational registry. Two hundred eighteen were treated with PCI and 86 with CABG. During the hospitalization, a trend toward a higher mortality rate was reported in PCI-treated patients (3.5% vs 7.3%, p = 0.32). At a median follow-up of 1,088 days, the incidence of the primary end point was similar in the 2 groups (32.6% vs 30.2%, p = 0.69). Incidence of target vessel revascularization at follow-up was higher in PCI-treated patients (10% vs 4.2%, p = 0.05). At multivariate analysis, left ventricular ejection fraction was the only independent predictor of the primary end point (hazard ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.91 to 0.98, p = 0.001). After adjustment with propensity score, the revascularization strategy was not significantly correlated to the incidence of the primary end point (hazard ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 1.71, p = 0.95). In octogenarians, no difference was observed in the occurrence of the primary end point after PCI or CABG for the treatment of ULMCA disease.

Thus, nursing students must show interest in nursing studies and in work with people. Moreover, it is desired that they have good communication skills. On the other hand, students who choose nursing as their future career may have high expectations from nursing education. The aim of this study was to explore nursing students' reasons for pursuing nursing studies. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate nursing students in Slovenia and Croatia. RESULTS A total of 314 students participated in the study. General satisfaction with their studies is higher among those students who are satisfied with their chosen study programme. The most important reasons to enter nursing studies were interest in the subject and good employment possibilities. As the biggest disadvantage of studying nursing, Slovenian students listed crowded schedules, while Croatian students mentioned faculty organization. Students from both countries agreed that the biggest advantage is the ease of finding a job after graduation. DISCUSSION As there is a lack of workforce in the healthcare sector, particularly a lack of nurses, universities must adjust their demands and improve study conditions to gain students' attention. Therefore, it is important to notice that nursing students perceive more advantages of studying nursing than disadvantages. CONCLUSION There are many different reasons to enter nursing studies. Students perceive many advantages in studying nursing, such as ease of employment, getting many hours of clinical practice and the possibility for promotion. On the other hand, there are some challenges in studying nursing, such as the schedule and organization of lectures, seminars and clinical placement. There is a need for further research in the field of nursing student's motivation, especially due to their decreasing motivation during the studies.","Cilar, Leona; Spevan, Marija; Čuček Trifkovič, Klavdija; Štiglic, Gregor",Nurse education today,169,1

During pressure support ventilation (PSV), a mismatch between demand and assist could increase work of breathing and limit exercise. A better exercise tolerance is possible with a proportional mode of ventilation (Proportional Assist Ventilation, PAV+ and Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist, NAVA). We examined whether, in critically ill patients, PSV and proportional ventilation have different effects on respiratory muscles unloading and work efficiency during exercise. METHODS Prospective pilot randomized cross-over study performed in a medico-surgical ICU. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation >48 h were enrolled. At initiation, the patients underwent an incremental workload test on a cycloergometer to determine the maximum level capacity. The next day, 2 15-min exercise, at 60% of the maximum capacity, were performed while patients were randomly ventilated with PSV and PAV+ or NAVA. The change in oxygen consumption (ΔVO2, indirect calorimetry) and the work efficiency (ratio of ΔVO2 per mean power) were computed. RESULTS Ten patients were examined, 6 ventilated with PSV/PAV+ and 4 with PSV/NAVA. Despite the same mean inspiratory pressure at baseline between the modes, baseline VO2 (median, IQR) was higher during proportional ventilation (301 ml/min, 270-342) compared to PSV (249 ml/min, 206-353). Exercise with PSV was associated with a significant increase in VO2 (ΔVO2, median, IQR) (77.6 ml/min, 59.9-96.5), while VO2 did not significantly change during exercise with proportional modes (46.3 ml/min, 5.7-63.7, p < 0.05). As a result, exercise with proportional modes was associated with a better work efficiency than with PSV. The ventilator modes did not affect patient's dyspnea, limb fatigue, distance, hemodynamics and breathing pattern. CONCLUSIONS Proportional ventilation during exercise results in higher work efficiency and less increase in VO2 compared to ventilation with PSV. These preliminary findings suggest that proportional ventilation could enhance the training effect and facilitate rehabilitation.","Akoumianaki, Evangelia; Dousse, Nicolas; Lyazidi, Aissam; Lefebvre, Jean-Claude; Graf, Severine; Cordioli, Ricardo Luiz; Rey, Nathalie; Richard, Jean-Christophe Marie; Brochard, Laurent",Annals of intensive care,169,1

In March 2020, Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, in partnership with city and state public health agencies, municipal leaders, and homeless service providers, developed and implemented a citywide COVID-19 care model for this vulnerable population. Components included symptom screening at shelter front doors, expedited testing at pop-up sites, isolation and management venues for symptomatic people under investigation and for people with confirmed disease, quarantine venues for asymptomatic exposed people, and contact investigation and tracing. Real-time disease surveillance efforts in a large shelter outbreak of COVID-19 during the third week of operations illustrated the need for several adaptations to the care model to better respond to the local epidemiology of illness among people experiencing homelessness. Symptom screening was de-emphasized given the high number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections discovered during mass testing; contact tracing and quarantining were phased out under the assumption of universal exposure among the sheltered population; and isolation and management venues were rapidly expanded to accommodate a surge in people with newly diagnosed COVID-19. During the first 6 weeks of operation, 429 of 1297 (33.1%) tested people were positive for COVID-19; of these, 395 people were experiencing homelessness at the time of testing, representing about 10% of the homeless adult population in Boston. Universal testing, as resources permit, is a focal point of ongoing efforts to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 on this vulnerable group of people.","Baggett, Travis P; Racine, Melanie W; Lewis, Elizabeth; De Las Nueces, Denise; O'Connell, James J; Bock, Barry; Gaeta, Jessie M",Public health reports,169,31

Perioperative mortality was 2% (n = 1), and the incidence of stroke was 0%. The mean lowest core body temperature reached during circulatory arrest was 23.8 ± 2.7°C with a mean ACP time of 21.8 ± 3.6 minutes. The mean aortic cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times were 160.6 ± 55.5 minutes and 204.7 ± 57.5 minutes, respectively. There were no cases of IA injury. Conclusions Direct IA cannulation with a pediatric arterial cannula is a safe and efficient method to allow ACP in aortic surgery requiring hypothermic circulatory arrest and may circumvent the potential complications of axillary cannulation.","Wai Sang, Stephane Leung; Beute, Tyler J; Timek, Tomasz",JTCVS techniques,169,31

The Hospital Incident Command System (HICS), as a standardized method for command and control, was established in Iranian hospitals, but it has performed fairly during disaster exercises. This paper describes the process for, and modifications to HICS undertaken to optimize disaster management in hospitals in Iran. METHODS In 2013, a group of 11 subject matter experts participated in an expert consensus modified Delphi to develop modifications to the 2006 version of HICS. RESULTS The following changes were recommended by the expert panel and subsequently implemented: 1) A Quality Control Officer was added to the Command group; 2) Security was defined as a new section; 3) Infrastructure and Business Continuity Branches were moved from the Operations Section to the Logistics and the Administration Sections, respectively; and 4) the Planning Section was merged within the Finance/Administration Section. CONCLUSION An expert consensus group developed a modified HICS that is more feasible to implement given the managerial organization of hospitals in Iran. This new model may enhance hospital performance in managing disasters. Additional studies are needed to test the feasibility and efficacy of the modified HICS in Iran, both during simulations and actual disasters. This process may be a useful model for other countries desiring to improve disaster incident management systems for their hospitals.","Djalali, Ahmadreza; Hosseinijenab, Vahid; Peyravi, Mahmoudreza; Nekoei-Moghadam, Mahmood; Hosseini, Bashir; Schoenthal, Lisa; Koenig, Kristi L",PLoS currents,169,17

Prospective studies documenting frequencies, persistence, and progression of HRV in this at-risk population are lacking. METHODS In the Clinical Trials in Organ Transplant in Children prospective observational study, we followed 61 lung transplant recipients for 2 years. We quantified molecular subtypes of HRV in serially collected nasopharyngeal (NP) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples and correlated them with clinical characteristics. RESULTS We identified 135 community acquired respiratory infections (CARV) from 397 BAL and 480 NP samples. We detected 93 HRV events in 42 (68.8%) patients, 22 of which (23.4%) were symptomatic. HRV events were contiguous with different genotypes identified in 23 cases but symptoms were not preferentially associated with any particular species. Nine (9.7%) HRV events persisted over multiple successive samples for a median of 36 days (range 18 - 408 days). Three persistent HRV were symptomatic. When we serially measured forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in 23 subjects with events, we did not observe significant decreases in lung function over 12 months post-HRV. CONCLUSION In conjunction with our previous reports, our prospectively collected data indicate that molecularly heterogeneous HRV infections occur commonly following pediatric lung transplantation, but these infections do not negatively impact clinical outcomes.","Ammerman, E; Sweet, S C; Storch, G A; Buller, R S; Mason, S; Conrad, C; Hayes, D; Faro, A; Goldfarb, S B; Melicoff, E; Schecter, M; Visner, G; Heeger, P S; Mohanakumar, T; N, Williams; Danziger-Isakov, L",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,169,1

Here, we designed a biotinylated peptide amphiphile (Biotin-PA) nanofiber, which serves as a noncovalent binding location for antigens. We showed that presenting the antigens on synthetic Biotin-PA nanofibers generated a higher immune response than the free antigens delivered with a CpG ODN (TLR9 agonist) adjuvant. Antigen attached Biotin-PA nanofibers triggered splenocytes to produce high levels of cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-12, TNF-α, and IL-6) and to exhibit a superior cross-presentation of the antigen. Both Biotin-PA nanofibers and CpG ODN induce a Th-1-biased IgG subclass response; however, delivering the antigen with Biotin-PA nanofibers induced significantly greater production of total IgG and subclasses of IgG compared to delivering the antigen with CpG ODN. Contrary to CpG ODN, Biotin-PA nanofibers also enhanced antigen-specific splenocyte proliferation and increased the proportion of the antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. Given their biodegradability and biocompatibility, Biotin-PA nanofibers have a significant potential in immunoengineering applications as a biomaterial for the delivery of a diverse set of antigens derived from intracellular pathogens, emerging viral diseases such as COVID-19, or cancer cells to induce humoral and cellular immune responses against the antigens.

The rapid community transmission and relatively high mortality rates with COVID-19 in modern times are relatively unique features of this flu pandemic and have resulted in an unparalleled global health crisis. SARS-CoV-2, being a respiratory virus, mainly affects the lungs, but is capable of infecting other vital organs, such as brain, heart and kidney. Emerging evidence suggests that the virus also targets male and female reproductive organs that express its main receptor ACE2, although it is as yet unclear if this has any implications for human fertility. Furthermore, professional bodies have recommended discontinuing fertility services during the pandemic such that reproductive services have also been affected. Although increased safety measures have helped to mitigate the propagation of COVID-19 in a number of countries, it seems that there is no predictable timeline to containment of the virus, a goal likely to remain elusive until an effective vaccine becomes available and widely distributed across the globe. In parallel, research on reproduction has been postponed for obvious reasons, while diagnostic tests that detect the virus or antibodies against it are of vital importance to support public health policies, such as social distancing and our obligation to wear masks in public spaces. This review aims to provide an overview of critical research and ethics issues that have been continuously emerging in the field of reproductive medicine as the COVID-19 pandemic tragically unfolds.Abbreviations: ACE2: angiotensin- converting enzyme 2; ART: Assisted reproductive technology; ASRM: American Society for Reproductive Medicine; CCR9: C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 9; CDC: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; COVID-19: Coronavirus disease 2019; Ct: Cycle threshold; CXCR6: C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 6; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ESHRE: European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology; ET: Embryo transfer; FSH: Follicle Stimulating Hormone; FFPE: formalin fixed paraffin embedded; FYCO1: FYVE And Coiled-Coil Domain Autophagy Adaptor 1; IFFS: International Federation of Fertility Societies; IUI: Intrauterine insemination; IVF: In vitro fertilization; LH: Luteinizing Hormone; LZTFL1: Leucine Zipper Transcription Factor Like 1; MAR: medically assisted reproduction services; MERS: Middle East Respiratory syndrome; NGS: Next Generation Sequencing; ORF: Open Reading Frame; PPE: personal protective equipment; RE: RNA Element; REDa: RNA Element Discovery algorithm; RT-PCR: Reverse=trascriptase transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; SARS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS-CoV-2: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; SLC6A20: Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 20; SMS: Single Molecule Sequencing; T: Testosterone; TMPRSS2: transmembrane serine protease 2; WHO: World Health Organization; XCR1: X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor.","Anifandis, George; Tempest, Helen G; Oliva, Rafael; Swanson, Grace M; Simopoulou, Mara; Easley, Charles A; Primig, Michael; Messini, Christina I; Turek, Paul J; Sutovsky, Peter; Ory, Steve J; Krawetz, Stephen A",Systems biology in reproductive medicine,169,24

However, the phosphorylation of protein is significantly altered during cancer progression which triggers abnormal cellular pathways and this phosphorylation can serve as an emergent diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for cancer. Herein, we develop a nanostructured mesoporous gold electrode (NMGE)-based biosensor that enables a highly sensitive detection of protein phosphorylation with electrochemical signal amplification. The biosensor comprises nanostructured mesoporous gold electrodes whose electro-conductive framework is superior to that of the nonporous electrodes. We characterize our developed nano/mesoporous gold electrode with various electrochemical methods in the presence of the [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- redox system. We find that the mesoporous gold electrode catalyzes both the oxidation and reduction processes of the [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- system and generates a current signal that is 3 times higher than that of the nonporous gold electrode. This superior signal transduction of our nano/mesoporous gold electrode is enabled through a pore-induced (i) high electrochemically active surface area and (ii) reduced impedance with a high signal to noise ratio. The assay utilizes direct adsorption of an immunoprecipitated purified BRAF protein towards the mesoporous gold electrode and thus avoids the cumbersome sensor surface functionalization. Our developed biosensor detects the phosphorylated BRAF protein with a 2.5-fold increase in sensitivity and an ≈10-fold increase in the limit of detection (LOD) in comparison with the nonporous gold electrodes. The assay also works on a wide dynamic range from 0.5 to 20 ng μL-1 of the protein which further shows its potential for clinical application. We envisage that this nanostructured mesoporous gold biosensor will be of high interest for clinical application.","Ahmed, Emtiaz; Masud, Mostafa Kamal; Hossain, Md Shahriar A; Na, Jongbeom; Sina, Abu Ali Ibn; Yamauchi, Yusuke; Trau, Matt",The Analyst,169,1

In this single-center cohort study, 215 COVID-19 recovered patients were recruited from all over Japan between April and September 2020. Demographic characteristics, hsTnT levels, and echocardiography data were collected for 209 patients, after excluding those without serum samples or good-quality echocardiographic images. The mean (± standard deviation) age was 44 (± 12) years (range: 36-55 years), and 50.7% of the patients were males. The median time interval (interquartile range) from COVID-19 onset to post-recovery examination was 56 days (34-96 days). Seventy-four recovered patients (35.4%) had hsTnT less than detection sensitivity (< 3 pg/mL) and 135 recovered patients (64.6%) had hsTnT ≥ 3 pg/mL. Ejection fraction was more than 50% in all cases. Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) and right ventricular free-wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) were reduced in 62 (29.7%) and 8 patients (3.8%), respectively. They were significantly associated with elevated hsTnT levels. In cases with hsTnT above 5 pg/mL, the LVGLS was greatly reduced to 19.0 ± 2.2% (p < 0.001). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that elevated hsTnT level was an independent predictor of reduced LVGLS (standardized β = -0.34; p < 0.001). In recovered COVID-19 patients, even a slight increase in hsTnT above detection sensitivity was associated with decreased LVGLS. hsTnT and echocardiography may be useful tools to detect myocardial injury in recovered COVID-19 patients.","Hayama, Hiromasa; Ide, Satoshi; Moroi, Masao; Kitami, Yui; Bekki, Norifumi; Kubota, Shuji; Uemura, Yukari; Hara, Hisao; Kutsuna, Satoshi; Ohmagari, Norio; Hiroi, Yukio",Global health & medicine,169,1

Mean age was 49.3+/-12.9 years, 20 were female, and 2 were male. Mean operating time was 238 minutes+/-72.7. Mean blood loss was 40mL+/-28.3mL. Mean weight of the gland was 137.05g+/-129.21g. The recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified with no permanent injury. Six patients developed hoarseness of the voice for a mean of 15.1+/-8.01 days. No patient developed tetany or hypocalcemia requiring treatment. Six patients experienced transient numbness in the anterior chest wall lasting 2 weeks in 5 patients and 2 months in one. All patients were discharged within 24 hours of admission. CONCLUSION ETTT requires additional operative time compared with the open approach, but is cosmetically favorable. Visualization of the nerve and parathyroid is much better. Although the learning curve is steep, with experience the operative time will decrease.

The synaptic mechanism of iTBS has long been known to be an effective method to induce long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in humans. However, there is limited evidence as to whether the antidepressant effect of iTBS is associated with change in synaptic function in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in preclinical study. Hence, we applied an antidepressant (i.e., fluoxetine)-resistant depression rat model induced by severe foot-shocks to investigate the antidepressant efficacy of iTBS in the synaptic pathology. The results showed that iTBS treatment improved not only the impaired LTP, but also the aberrant long-term depression in the PFC of antidepressant-resistant depression model rats. Moreover, the mechanism of LTP improvement by iTBS involved downstream molecules of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, while the mechanism of long-term depression improvement by iTBS involved downstream molecules of proBDNF. The aberrant spine morphology was also improved by iTBS treatment. This study demonstrated that the mechanism of the iTBS paradigm is complex and may regulate not only excitatory but also inhibitory synaptic effects in the PFC.","Lee, Chi-Wei; Wu, Han-Fang; Chu, Ming-Chia; Chung, Yueh-Jung; Mao, Wei-Chang; Li, Cheng-Ta; Lin, Hui-Ching",Cerebral cortex,169,5

Randomized trials have demonstrated that opioid therapy for up to 12-16weeks is superior to placebo, but have not addressed longer-term use. In the United States, opioid sales have quadrupled during 2000-2010, with parallel increases in opioid accidental overdose deaths and substance abuse admissions. Clinical use of long-term opioid therapy is characterized by a pattern of adverse selection, where high-risk patients are prescribed high-risk opioid regimens. This adverse selection may link these trends in use, abuse, and overdose. Long-term opioid therapy appears to be associated with iatrogenic harm to the patients who receive the prescriptions and to the general population.

OBJECTIVE To measure the association between infection with respiratory RNA viruses and pneumonia in children. METHODS From March 2006 to July 2007, we conducted a case-control study of 680 pneumonia cases (WHO criteria) and 680 randomly selected, concurrently sampled age-matched controls among children aged 2-35 months in Bhaktapur, Nepal. A nasopharyngeal aspirate from each child was examined for 7 respiratory viruses using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We calculated the matched odds ratios (MORs) for the detection of the individual viruses from a case compared with a control as measures of pathogenicity using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS At least 1 virus was recovered in 248 (36.5%) cases and 48 (7.1%) controls. The MOR varied from 2.0 to 13.0; the highest associations were observed for parainfluenza virus type 3 (MOR 13.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.0-28.0), respiratory syncytial virus (MOR 10.7; CI 4.6-24.6), and influenza A (MOR 6.3; CI 1.9-21.4). We observed that the association was lower for children age 2-5 months compared with older children for parainfluenza virus type 3 (P value for interaction 0.002). CONCLUSIONS All of the 7 respiratory viruses were associated with pneumonia, but their pathogenicity varied.

There is insufficient reliable information on long-term comparative outcomes of these procedures. The primary aim of this study was to compare subjective and objective outcomes of LSHP and VH. The secondary aim was to record adverse events, recurrent prolapse, and new-onset stress urinary incontinence (SUI) up to 2 years. METHODS Women with symptomatic uterovaginal prolapse who opted for either LSHP or VH were included. Subjective outcomes were compared at 1 and 2 years from baseline using the validated questionnaires. Objective/anatomical outcomes using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system were assessed before and at 3 months after surgery. Adverse events, recurrent prolapse, and new-onset SUI was recorded up to 2 years. RESULTS The study assessed 226 women with uterovaginal prolapse; 125 opted for surgery (44 LSHP, 81 VH). There was no statistically significant difference in symptom domains between groups at baseline and 1 and 2 years. At 3 months POP-Q, greater improvement was seen in points Ba and Ap in the LSHP group compared to VH group and smaller genital hiatus was seen in the VH group. Adverse events, recurrent prolapse, or new-onset SUI were not significantly different in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Both LSHP and VH are effective surgical options for uterovaginal prolapse.

We sought to develop a risk-adjustment method using administrative claims data to assess both national-level and hospital-specific performance. METHODS A total of 35,179,507 patient stay records from 2001-2006 Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR) files were randomly divided into development and validation sets. Risk stratification indices (RSIs) for length of stay and mortality endpoints were derived from aggregate risk associated with individual diagnostic and procedure codes. Performance of RSIs were tested prospectively on the validation database, as well as a single institution registry of 103,324 adult surgical patients, and compared with the Charlson comorbidity index, which was designed to predict 1-yr mortality. The primary outcome was the C statistic indicating the discriminatory power of alternative risk-adjustment methods for prediction of outcome measures. RESULTS A single risk-stratification model predicted 30-day and 1-yr postdischarge mortality; separate risk-stratification models predicted length of stay and in-hospital mortality. The RSIs performed well on the national dataset (C statistics for median length of stay and 30-day mortality were 0.86 and 0.84). They performed significantly better than the Charlson comorbidity index on the Cleveland Clinic registry for all outcomes. The C statistics for the RSIs and Charlson comorbidity index were 0.89 versus 0.60 for median length of stay, 0.98 versus 0.65 for in-hospital mortality, 0.85 versus 0.76 for 30-day mortality, and 0.83 versus 0.77 for 1-yr mortality. Addition of demographic information only slightly improved performance of the RSI. CONCLUSION RSI is a broadly applicable and robust system for assessing hospital length of stay and mortality for groups of surgical patients based solely on administrative data.","Sessler, Daniel I; Sigl, Jeffrey C; Manberg, Paul J; Kelley, Scott D; Schubert, Armin; Chamoun, Nassib G",Anesthesiology,169,1

The impact of the type of anesthesia used during mechanical thrombectomy on patient outcomes remains controversial. This review discusses the current literature on the effects of anesthesia type on patient outcome following endovascular stroke therapy. RECENT FINDINGS EVT is the standard of treatment for intracranial large vessel occlusions. Recent studies show that general anesthesia is associated with negative clinical outcome in AIS patients undergoing EVT. Two of the possible mechanisms of this finding are systolic hypotension and hypocapnia. However, the only published randomized controlled studies to date, sedation vs. intubation for endovascular stroke treatment and anesthesia during stroke showed no difference in short-term clinical outcome between EVT patients treated with general anesthesia and conscious sedation and improved longer-term outcome in the general anesthesia group. SUMMARY Retrospective reports, and the 2015 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Guideline (focused update of the 2013 guidelines for the early management of patients with AIS regarding endovascular treatment) based on these reports, are in favor of sedation (conscious sedation) over general anesthesia for endovascular stroke thrombectomy. However, the two randomized controlled prospective studies published provide inconclusive evidence as to the best anesthetic practice for endovascular stroke therapy. More randomized clinical trials are needed to optimize anesthetic patient care in AIS.","Wang, Arthur; Abramowicz, Apolonia E",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,169,15

The objective of this study was to estimate to what extent the increased risk among people with diabetes could impact the secondary care costs of COVID-19 throughout Europe during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from January to June 2020. METHODS Applying a health care cost model based on inputs from data published in international peer-reviewed journals, identified via a rapid literature review this study aimed to estimate the total secondary sector costs of COVID-19. Estimates of unit costs were based on data from Denmark, France, Spain and the UK. We calculated average costs per patient without diabetes and according to four diabetes categories based on risk of hospitalisation, admission to intensive care unit, ventilator support and length of hospital stay. RESULTS The estimated cost per hospital admission during the first wave of COVID-19 in Europe ranged between EUR 25,018 among people with type 2 diabetes in good glycaemic control to EUR 57,244 among people with type 1 diabetes in poor glycaemic control, reflecting higher risk of intensive care, ventilator support and longer hospital stay according to diabetes category, while the corresponding cost for people without diabetes was estimated at EUR 16,993. The total direct costs of secondary care of COVID-19 in Europe were estimated at EUR 13.9 billion. Thus, 23.5% of the total costs accounted for treating people with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the importance of a greater focus on prevention and adequate treatment of diabetes and the need for special attention to avoid infection with COVID-19 to the extent possible among those already diagnosed with diabetes.","Bain, Stephen C; Czernichow, Sebastien; Bøgelund, Mette; Madsen, Maria Elmegaard; Yssing, Cecilie; McMillan, Annabell Cajus; Hvid, Christian; Hettiarachchige, Nadilka; Haagen Panton, Ulrik",Current medical research and opinion,169,24

The authors examined whether leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) shares genetic and environmental variances between spelling, essay writing, reading aloud, reading comprehension, and mathematics in early adolescence. Moreover, they investigated whether genetic polymorphisms associated with physical activity behavior affect these academic skills. METHODS Participants were 12-year-old Finnish twins (n = 4356-4370 twins/academic skill, 49% girls). Academic skills were assessed by teachers, and LTPA was self-reported. Polygenic scores for physical activity behavior were constructed from the UK Biobank. Quantitative genetic modeling and linear regression models were used to analyze the data. RESULTS The trait correlations between LTPA and academic skills were significant but weak (r = .05-.08). The highest trait correlation was found between LTPA and mathematics. A significant genetic correlation was revealed between LTPA and essay writing (rA = .14).

Chest CT findings have the potential to guide management in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Objective. To explore a CT visual severity score in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with attention to temporal changes in the score and the role of the score in a model for predicting in-hospital complications. Methods. This retrospective study included 161 inpatients with COVID-19 from three hospitals in China who underwent serial chest CT scans during hospitalization. CT examinations were evaluated using a visual severity scoring system. The temporal pattern of the CT visual severity score across serial CT examinations during hospitalization was characterized using a generalized spline regression model. A prognostic model to predict major complications, including in-hospital mortality, was created using the CT visual severity score and clinical variables. External model validation was performed in a cohort of 135 patients from a different hospital, evaluated by two independent radiologists. Results. The cohort included 91 survivors with non-severe disease, 55 survivors with severe disease, and 15 patients who died during hospitalization. Median CT visual lung severity score in the first week of hospitalization was 2.0 in survivors with non-severe disease, 4.0 in survivors with severe disease, and 11.0 in non-survivors. CT visual severity score peaked on hospitalization day 9 and 12 in survivors with non-severe and severe disease, respectively, and progressively decreased in subsequent hospitalization weeks in both groups. In the prognostic model, in-hospital complications were independently associated with a severe CT score (odds ratio [OR] 31.28), moderate CT score (OR 5.86), age (OR 1.09 per year increase), and lymphocyte count (OR 0.03 per 1*10^9/L increase). In the validation cohort, the two readers achieved C-index of 0.92-0.95, accuracy 85.2%-86.7%, sensitivity 70.7%-75.6%, and specificity 91.4%-91.5% for predicting in-hospital complications. Conclusion. A CT visual severity score is associated with clinical disease severity and evolves in a characteristic fashion during hospitalization for COVID-19. A prognostic model based on the CT visual severity score and clinical variables has strong performance in predicting in-hospital complications. Clinical Impact. The prognostic model using the CT visual severity score may help identify patients at highest risk of poor outcomes and guide early intervention.","Wang, Xiaofeng; Hu, Xingxing; Tan, Weijun; Mazzone, Peter; Mireles-Cabodevila, Eduardo; Han, Xiao-Zhen; Huang, Pingyue; Hu, Weihua; Dweik, Raed; Cheng, Zhenshun",AJR.

Whereas polymorphisms in interferon-lambda 3 (IFNL3, previously named IL28B) strongly influence the clinical course of hepatitis C, few studies examined the role of such polymorphisms in infections due to viruses other than hepatitis C virus. OBJECTIVES To analyze the association of newly identified IFNL3/4 variant rs368234815 with susceptibility to CMV-associated retinitis in a cohort of HIV-infected patients. DESIGN AND METHODS This retrospective longitudinal study included 4884 white patients from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, among whom 1134 were at risk to develop CMV retinitis (CD4 nadir < 00 /μl and positive CMV serology). The association of CMV-associated retinitis with rs368234815 was assessed by cumulative incidence curves and multivariate Cox regression models, using the estimated date of HIV infection as a starting point, with censoring at death and/or lost follow-up. RESULTS A total of 40 individuals among 1134 patients at risk developed CMV retinitis. The minor allele of rs368234815 was associated with a higher risk of CMV retinitis (log-rank test P = 0.007, recessive mode of inheritance). The association was still significant in a multivariate Cox regression model (hazard ratio 2.31, 95% confidence interval 1.09-4.92, P = 0.03), after adjustment for CD4 nadir and slope, HAART and HIV-risk groups. CONCLUSION We reported for the first time an association between an IFNL3/4 polymorphism and susceptibility to AIDS-related CMV retinitis.

It seems appropriate, then, to put into practice a novel approach able to provide the scientific community and other interested parties with quality evidence that is actionable, and rapidly and efficiently produced. Methods and analysis We designed a protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews and overviews of systematic reviews in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P). We will search for primary studies and systematic reviews that answer different questions related to COVID-19 using both a centralized repository (Epistemonikos database) and a manual search in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We will also search for literature in several other sources. At least two researchers will independently undertake the selection of studies, data extraction, and assessment of the quality of the included studies. We will synthesize data for each question using meta-analysis, when possible, and we will prepare Summary of Findings tables according to the GRADE approach. All the evidence will be organized in an open platform (L·OVE - Living OVerview of Evidence) that will be continuously updated using artificial intelligence and a broad network of experts. Ethics and dissemination No ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of these articles will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks, and traditional media, and will be sent to relevant international organizations discussing this topic.","Rada, Gabriel; Verdugo-Paiva, Francisca; Ávila, Camila; Morel-Marambio, Macarena; Bravo-Jeria, Rocío; Pesce, Franco; Madrid, Eva; Izcovich, Ariel",Medwave,169,20

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS This study was conducted in 2 wound healing clinics-a university hospital-based clinic and a community-based clinic. Forty-five chronic wound subjects, stratified to either foot or leg ulcers, were followed for 5 weeks. METHODS A multicenter, prospective, double-blind, pilot, randomized controlled clinical trial with 3 study visits (Weeks 0, 2, 4) documented pain and local wound characteristics using NERDS and STONEES clinical criteria to determine superficial bacterial damage or deep/surrounding infection. RESULTS The use of PHMB foam dressing was a significant predictor of reduced wound superficial bacterial burden (P = .016) at week 4 as compared with the foam alone. Pain reduction was also statistically significant at week 2 (P = .0006) and at week 4 (P = .02) in favor of the PHMB foam dressings. Polymicrobial organisms were recovered at week 4 in 5.3% in the PHMB foam dressing group versus 33% in the control group (P = .04). Subjects randomized to the PHMB foam dressing had a 35% median reduction in wound size by week 4, compared with 28% in the control group.

Previous work has demonstrated that neuroinflammation is involved in CTE pathogenesis, however, the specific inflammatory mechanisms are still unclear. Here, using RNA-sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we investigated the genetic changes found in tissue taken from the region CTE pathology is first found, the cortical sulcus, and compared it to neighboring gryal crest tissue to identify what pathways were directly related to initial hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) deposition. 21 cases were chosen for analysis: 6 cases had no exposure to RHI or presence of neurodegenerative disease (Control), 5 cases had exposure to RHI but no presence of neurodegenerative disease (RHI), and 10 cases had exposure to RHI and low stage CTE (CTE). Two sets of genes were identified: genes that changed in both the sulcus and crest and genes that changed specifically in the sulcus relative to the crest. When examining genes that changed in both the sulcus and crest, GSEA demonstrated an increase in immune related processes and a decrease in neuronal processes in RHI and CTE groups. Sulcal specific alterations were observed to be driven by three mechanisms: anatomy, RHI, or p-tau. First, we observed consistent sulcal specific alterations in immune, extracellular matrix, vascular, neuronal, and endocytosis/exocytosis categories across all groups, suggesting the sulcus has a unique molecular signature compared to the neighboring crest independent of pathology. Second, individuals with a history of RHI demonstrated impairment in metabolic and mitochondrial related processes. Finally, in individuals with CTE, we observed impairment of immune and phagocytic related processes. Overall, this work provides the first observation of biological processes specifically altered in the sulcus that could be directly implicated in CTE pathogenesis and provide novel targets for biomarkers and therapies.","Cherry, Jonathan D; Agus, Filisia; Dixon, Erin; Huber, Bertrand; Alvarez, Victor E; Mez, Jesse; McKee, Ann C; Labadorf, Adam; Stein, Thor D",Free neuropathology,169,1

A 2-year prospective cohort surveillance study of symptomatic and asymptomatic RVIs was performed in hospitalized HSCT patients. Oropharyngeal (OP) swab samples were serially collected each week from 1 week before and up to 100 days after HSCT and were tested for virus isolation with cell culture-based viral isolation (CC-based VI) and a multiplex PCR (MPCR). A total of 2,747 OP swab samples were collected from 250 HSCT patients (268 HSCT procedures). Among these patients, 79 had RVIs (CC-based VI, n = 63; MPCR, n = 17). The parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) accounted for 71% (57/80) of the cases of RVIs. Some PIV3 infections were asymptomatic and involved a longer virus-shedding period. The PIV3 was often cultured from samples taken before the onset of a respiratory disease. The PIV3 infections were attributed to the transmission of nosocomial infections. PIV3 infections before engraftment will more likely result in the development of lower respiratory tract infections and worse outcomes. A real-time monitoring of respiratory viral infections in the HSCT ward among patients with or without respiratory symptoms is required for the prevention of nosocomial RVIs, especially of PIV3 infections.","Kakiuchi, Satsuki; Tsuji, Masanori; Nishimura, Hidekazu; Wang, Lixing; Takayama-Ito, Mutsuyo; Kinoshita, Hitomi; Lim, Chang-Kweng; Taniguchi, Shuichi; Oka, Akira; Mizuguchi, Masashi; Saijo, Masayuki",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,169,16

To obtain a comprehensive view of the effects of MV infection on target cells, DNA microarray analyses of two different cell-types were performed. An epithelial (293SLAM; a 293 cell line stably expressing SLAM) and lymphoid (COBL-a) cell line were inoculated with purified wild-type MV. Microarray analyses revealed significant differences in the regulation of cellular gene expression between these two different cells. In 293SLAM cells, upregulation of genes involved in the antiviral response was rapidly induced; in the later stages of infection, this was followed by regulation of many genes across a broad range of functional categories. On the other hand, in COBL-a cells, only a limited set of gene expression profiles was modulated after MV infection. Since it was reported that V protein of MV inhibited the IFN signaling pathway, we performed a microarray analysis using V knockout MV to evaluate V protein's effect on cellular gene expression. The V knockout MV displayed a similar profile to that of parental MV. In particular, in COBL-a cells infected with the virus, no alteration of cellular gene expression, including IFN signaling, was observed. Furthermore, IFN signaling analyzed in vitro was completely suppressed by MV infection in the COBL-a cells. These results reveal that MV induces different cellular responses in a cell-type specific manner. Microarray analyses will provide us useful information about potential mechanisms of MV pathogenesis.","Sato, Hiroki; Honma, Reiko; Yoneda, Misako; Miura, Ryuichi; Tsukiyama-Kohara, Kyoko; Ikeda, Fusako; Seki, Takahiro; Watanabe, Shinya; Kai, Chieko",Virology,169,19

We applied evidence-based methods to investigate the role of preclinical studies in predicting human DILI using two anti-diabetic drugs from the same class, but with different toxicological profiles: troglitazone (withdrawn from US market due to DILI) and rosiglitazone (remains on US market). Evidence Stream 1: A systematic literature review of in vivo studies on rosiglitazone or troglitazone was conducted (PROSPERO registration CRD42018112353). Evidence Stream 2: in vitro data on troglitazone and rosiglitazone were retrieved from the US EPA ToxCast database. Evidence Stream 3: troglitazone- and rosiglitazone-related DILI cases were retrieved from WHO Vigibase. All three evidence stream analyses were conducted according to evidence-based methodologies and performed according to pre-registered protocols. Evidence Stream 1: 9288 references were identified, with 42 studies included in analysis. No reported biomarker for either drug indicated a strong hazard signal in either preclinical animal or human studies. All included studies had substantial limitations, resulting in ""low"" or ""very low"" certainty in findings. Evidence Stream 2: Troglitazone was active in twice as many in vitro assays (129) as rosiglitazone (60), indicating a strong signal for more off-target effects. Evidence Stream 3: We observed a fivefold difference in both all adverse events and liver-related adverse events reported, and an eightfold difference in fatalities for troglitazone, compared to rosiglitazone. In summary, published animal and human trials failed to predict troglitazone's potential to cause severe liver injury in a wider patient population, while in vitro data showed marked differences in the two drugs' off-target activities, offering a new paradigm for reducing drug attrition in late development and in the market.

This will require policy change across the economic sectors that govern food systems, including agriculture, trade, finance, commerce and industry - a goal that has been beset by political challenges. These sectors have been strongly influenced by entrenched policy agendas and paradigms supported by influential global actors such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). METHODS This study draws on the concept of path dependency to examine how historical economic policy agendas and paradigms have influenced current food and nutrition policy and politics in Ghana. Qualitative data were collected through interviews with 29 relevant policy actors, and documentary data were collected from current policies, academic and grey literature, historical budget statements and World Bank Group Archives (1950-present). RESULTS Despite increased political priority for nutrition in Ghana, its integration into food policy remains limited. Food policy agendas are strongly focused on production, employment and economic returns, and existing market-based incentives do not support a nutrition-sensitive food supply. This policy focus appears to be rooted in a liberal economic approach to food policy arising from structural adjustment in the 1980s and trade liberalization in the 1990s, combined with historical experience of 'failure' of food policy intervention and an entrenched narrowly economic conception of food security. CONCLUSION This study suggests that attention to policy paradigms, in addition to specific points of policy change, will be essential for improving the outcomes of food systems for nutrition. An historical perspective can provide food and health policy-makers with insights to foster the revisioning of food policy to address multiple national policy objectives, including nutrition.","Thow, Anne Marie; Apprey, Charles; Winters, Janelle; Stellmach, Darryl; Alders, Robyn; Aduku, Linda Nana Esi; Mulcahy, Georgina; Annan, Reginald",International journal of health policy and management,169,8

OBJECTIVES The objectives were to: i) identify the number and type of treatments for pain currently used by stroke survivors with chronic pain; and ii) examine the self-perceived effectiveness of medication and non-medication treatments for pain. METHODS Cross-sectional survey. Participants with stroke and self-reported chronic pain completed an online survey that measured demographics, stroke related factors, intensity of pain, treatments for pain, and perceived effect of medication and non-medication treatments for pain. RESULTS Of 322 stroke survivors who completed the survey, the majority (90.1%) reported current use of pain treatment(s). Medications were accessed by 257 (79.8%), with the most common being anti-inflammatories (39.8%), anticonvulsants (29.5%) and antidepressants (24.8%). Paracetamol (12.1%) was the most common non-prescribed medication used. Polypharmacy was high, with 129 (40.1%) reporting taking 2 or more medications. Medication treatments were self-reported to be effective in 47.1% of those taking medication. Non-medication treatments were accessed by 208 (64.6%), with Physical Therapy/Physiotherapy being most common (48.1%), followed by Occupational Therapy (15.5%) and Psychology (11.8%).

Therefore, total TH may be inappropriate for these patients. We here report the first case of modified TH for a malignant liver tumor in China.The patient was a 26-year-old man with a 10-year HBV infection. Preoperative CT showed a 1.2 cm × 0.9 cm mass located in segment VIII. His alpha-fetal protein level was 444 ng/mL. Child-Pugh was Grade (A, 6), whereas an ICG-15 test yielded 2.7%. HCC was diagnosed preoperatively. The indications for TH were difficult tumor location, HCC, and a young patient with good resilience.The modified TH included 2 steps: (1) the patient was placed in a supine position. IUSO was used to locate the tumor in segment VIII and determine that intrahepatic metastasis had not occurred. The hepatoduodenal ligament was hanged over using a Pringle maneuver; (2) patient was then placed in the left-lateral position with single-lung ventilation. Three trocars were placed into the right thoracic cavity. The intra-thoracic space was observed using a regular 10-mm rigid scope. The diaphragm was transected and retracted. IUSO was used again to confirm the tumor location. Under the Pringle maneuver (once every 10 min), the superficial portion of the liver was transected by ultrasonic shears, whereas the deeper tissue was transected by LigaSure. Bipolar was used for hemostasis. The specimen was put into a retrieval bag and removed from the abdominal trocar. The diaphragm was repaired by running suturing.

Home-based BP management can be effective at maintaining optimal BP. OBJECTIVE To describe the optimization of a digital intervention for stroke patients and the value of participant diversity, using the person-based approach (PBA) and integral patient and public involvement (PPI). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Stroke patients recruited from primary care and community settings, and health-care professionals in primary care, in England and Ireland. DESIGN Three linked qualitative studies conducted iteratively to develop an intervention using the PBA, with integral PPI. INTERVENTION The BP: Together intervention, adapted from existing BP self-monitoring interventions, is delivered via mobile phone or web interface to support self-monitoring of BP at home. It alerts patients and their clinicians when a change in antihypertensive medication is needed. FINDINGS Feedback from a diverse range of participants identified potential barriers, which were addressed to improve the intervention accessibility, feasibility and persuasiveness. Easy-to-read materials were developed to improve usability for patients with aphasia and lower literacy. The importance of including family members who support patient care was also highlighted. Feedback messages regarding medication change were refined to ensure usefulness for patients and clinicians. DISCUSSION Input from PPI alongside qualitative research with a diverse study sample allowed the creation of a simple and equitable BP management intervention for stroke patients. PATIENT INVOLVEMENT Two PPI co-investigators contributed to design, conduct of study, data interpretation and manuscript preparation; community PPI sessions informed early planning. Study participants were stroke patients and family members.","Rai, Tanvi; Morton, Kate; Roman, Cristian; Doogue, Roisin; Rice, Cathy; Williams, Marney; Schwartz, Claire; Velardo, Carmelo; Tarassenko, Lionel; Yardley, Lucy; McManus, Richard J; Hinton, Lisa",Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health care and health policy,169,1

Establishing a relationship among these three predictors is therefore important for comprehensive assessment of the circulatory system, but very few studies focused on this. In this study, we first derived a mathematical description for localized luminal pressure change (p) as a function of arterial wall strain () and transverse shear modulus (_T); the arterial wall was modelled as a transversely isotropic and piecewise linearly-elastic material. Finite element simulations (FES) and in vitro fluid-driven inflation experiments were performed on arteries with both normal and abnormal geometries and _T in the experimental study were estimated by an ultrasound elastographic imaging framework (UEIF). FES results showed good accuracy (percent errors 6.42%) of the proposed method for all simulated artery models. Experimental results showed excellent repeatability and reproducibility. Estimated (p) _pp values (average peak-to-peak pressure change) compared with pressure meter measurements in two normal geometry phantoms and an excised aorta were 65.95 4.29 mmHg vs. 66.45 3.80 mmHg, 60.49 1.82 mmHg vs. 59.92 2.69, and 36.03 1.90 mmHg vs. 38.8 3.21 mmHg, respectively. For the artery with abnormal geometry mimicking a simple plaque shape, the feasibility of the proposed method for p estimation was also validated. Results demonstrated that UEIF with the proposed mathematical model, which lumped wall deformation, stiffness and luminal pressure, could estimate the localized dynamic luminal pressure change noninvasively and accurately.","Wang, Yahua; Lee, Wei-Ning",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,169,1

As of 1 October, 2020, 33,842,281 confirmed cases and 1,010,634 confirmed deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization from 216 countries. Despite the urgent need of effective treatment strategies, there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 currently and the treatment guidelines for COVID-19 vary among countries. AREA COVERED In this article, we summarized the current knowledge about the causative pathogen and the pandemic worldwide. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention and various treatment options of COVID-19 will be discussed for better acknowledgment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). EXPERT OPINION The situation of the COVID-19 pandemic is still unpredictable. There is no effective vaccine or specific anti-viral drug to treat serve COVID-19 patients. Combination therapies such as a triple combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin have shown promising clinical improvement. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs might be one of possible treatment options.

It is unclarified whether this relates to Graves' disease or chronic disease per se. The aim of our study was to estimate the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in patients with Graves' disease compared to patients with another chronic thyroid disease, nodular goitre, and to investigate determinants of anxiety and depression in Graves' disease. METHODS 157 cross-sectionally sampled patients with Graves' disease, 17 newly diagnosed, 140 treated, and 251 controls with nodular goitre completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The differences in the mean HADS scores between the groups were analysed using multiple linear regression, controlling for socio-demographic variables. HADS scores were also analysed dichotomized: a score >10 indicating probable 'anxiety'/probable 'depression'. Determinants of anxiety and depression symptoms in Graves' disease were examined using multiple linear regression. RESULTS In Graves' disease levels of anxiety (p = 0.008) and depression (p = 0.014) were significantly higher than in controls. The prevalence of depression was 10% in Graves' disease versus 4% in nodular goitre (p = 0.038), anxiety was 18 versus 13% (p = 0.131). Symptoms of anxiety (p = 0.04) and depression (p = 0.01) increased with comorbidity. Anxiety symptoms increased with duration of Graves' disease (p = 0.04). Neither thyroid function nor autoantibody levels were associated with anxiety and depression symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Anxiety and depression symptoms were more severe in Graves' disease than in nodular goitre. Symptoms were positively correlated to comorbidity and duration of Graves' disease but neither to thyroid function nor thyroid autoimmunity.","Bové, Kira Bang; Watt, Torquil; Vogel, Asmus; Hegedüs, Laszlo; Bjoerner, Jakob Bue; Groenvold, Mogens; Bonnema, Steen Joop; Rasmussen, Åse Krogh; Feldt-Rasmussen, Ulla",European thyroid journal,169,24

With fellowship interviews beginning in April 2020, there was minimal time to adapt. Each program rapidly developed its own platform, expectations, materials, and process for interviews, and applicants were exposed to a wide array of variability in the process - all while under the stress of interviewing for fellowship positions. AIMS The aim of this survey-based study was to obtain input from applicants to help guide program decisions about ""best practice"" for the future for both pediatric anesthesiology and other graduate medical education matches. METHODS A 28-question survey was developed utilizing Qualtrics. An anonymous link was sent to all pediatric anesthesiology program directors for distribution of the survey link to all recently matched applicants. Incoming fellows who were accepted outside of the match process were also invited to respond. RESULTS 50 respondents completed the survey, for a response rate of 30% based on the 167 matched fellowship positions nationwide (50/167). A majority of the respondents reported they felt virtual interviews allowed them to learn the following things equally as well compared with a traditional interview about fellowship programs: salary and benefits, available academic opportunities, available clinical opportunities, clinical schedule of the fellowship, mentorship opportunities, clinical experience and training of the fellowship, and expected work-life balance during fellowship. Respondents report that the most important factors in making their rank list were perceived goodness of fit, desired geographic location, and perception of program leadership. Additionally, respondents ranked the types of information and interactions that they found most helpful to make decisions. All respondents reported the benefit of cost savings compared to a traditional application cycle, with the most commonly reported estimated savings being $3,000-$5,000 per respondent. CONCLUSIONS These results allow recommendations for ""best practices"" for virtual interviews to include programs providing an electronic packet of information prior to the interview day, providing dedicated time for applicants to interact with current fellows, providing applicants an understanding of the city/region of the location of the program, and offering a completely optional post-interview visit, when possible. Based on the results of this survey, we recommend that programs continue to offer virtual interviews as a penalty-free option for applicants, even when in-person interviews may be feasible.","DiGiusto, Matthew; Lupa, M Concetta; Corridore, Marco; Sivak, Erica L; Lockman, Justin L",Paediatric anaesthesia,169,1

OBJECTIVE We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of 33 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who received painless fiberoptic bronchoscopy in Wuhan First Hospital. The general demographic and clinical data of the patients including age, gender, and ASA classification were collected. The patients received intravenous anesthesia with topical airway anesthesia with lidocaine. The changes in the vital signs of the patients were recorded before, during and after the procedure. The cough intensity of the patients during bronchoscopy were evaluated, and the adverse reactions within 24 h after the procedure were observed. The health status of the medical staff carrying out the procedure was also monitored. OBJECTIVE The 33 patients with ASA class Ⅱ to Ⅳ included 19 male and 14 female patients with an average age of 63.58±11.85 years. The lowest SpO2 of the patients during bronchoscopy was (94.8±4.3)%, which was significantly lower than that before the procedure [(99.1±1.3)%, P < 0.05] but was restored to more than 95% after such treatment as holding the jaw to open the airway or face mask positive-pressure ventilation. Bronchoscopy was completed successfully in all the patients, and 28 patients (84.85%) had mild cough during the procedure. None of the patients had obvious complications related to anesthesia. While performing the procedure, all the medical staff used third-level protection and facial protection with powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR), and the patients' face were covered with single-use sterile medical plastic curtains that were originally intended for collecting flushing fluid during arthroscopic procedures. No medical personnel was diagnosed with COVID-19 at the end of the study. OBJECTIVE For patients with COVID-19, painless techniques can be valuable during bronchoscopy, and this procedure can be safe and feasible under third-level protection.","Wang, J; Yang, S; Chen, J; Chen, Z",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,169,33

Here, additional roles/benefits of FS/FG in spine surgery are explored; these include increased hemostasis, reduction of scar, reduction of the risk of infection if impregnated with antibiotics, and its application to restrict diffusion and limit some of the major complications attributed to the controversial ""off-label"" use of bone morphogeneitc protein (rhBMP-2/INFUSE). METHODS We reviewed multiple studies, focusing not just on the utility of FS/FG in the treatment of CSF fistulas, but on its other applications. RESULTS FS/FG have been primarily used to supplement elective/traumatic dural closure in spinal surgery. However, FS/FG also contribute to; hemostasis, reducing intraoperative/postoperative bleeding/transfusion requirements, length of stay (LOS)/costs, reduced postoperative scar/radiculitis, and infection when impregnated with antibiotics. Nevertheless, one should seriously question whether FS/FG should be applied to prevent diffusion and limit major complications attributed to the ""off-label"" use of BMP/INFUSE (e.g., limit/prevent heterotopic ossification, dysphagia/respiratory decompensation, and new neurological deficits). CONCLUSIONS FS/FG successfully supplement watertight dural closure following elective (e.g., intradural tumor) or traumatic CSF fistulas occurring during spinal surgery. Additional benefits include: intraoperative hemostasis with reduced postoperative drainage, reduced transfusion requirements, reduced LOS, cost, scar, and prophylaxis against infection (e.g., impregnated with antibiotics). However, one should seriously question whether FS/FG should be used to contain the diffusion of BMP/INFUSE and limit its complications when utilized ""off-label"".","Epstein, Nancy E",Surgical neurology international,169,19

Invasive mechanical ventilation, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and high flow nasal insufflation were three therapies used to phenotype patients leading to a total of seven subgroups; patients treated with a single therapy (3), patients treated with either form of noninvasive ventilation and subsequently requiring intubation (2), and patients initially intubated and then weaned onto a noninvasive therapy (2).

Ketamine, a chiral phencyclidine derivative, was incubated with recombinant human CYP3A4 from a baculovirus expression system as racemic mixture and as single enantiomer. Alkaline liquid/liquid extracts of the samples were analyzed with a pH 2.5 buffer comprising 50 mM Tris and phosphoric acid together with either multiple isomer sulfated β-cyclodextrin (10 mg/mL) or highly sulfated γ-cyclodextrin (2%, w/v). Data obtained in the absence of ketoconazole revealed that the N-demethylation occurred stereoselectively with Michaelis-Menten (incubation of racemic ketamine) and Hill (separate incubation of single enantiomers) kinetics. Data generated in the presence of ketoconazole as the inhibitor could best be fitted to a one-site competitive model and inhibition constants were calculated using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff. No stereoselective difference was observed, but inhibition constants for the incubation of racemic ketamine were found to be larger compared with those obtained with the incubation of single ketamine enantiomers.","Kwan, Hiu Ying; Thormann, Wolfgang",Electrophoresis,169,19

Clinical teams at Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH) needed resources for identifying and assimilating the medical literature regarding COVID-19, which was expanding and evolving daily. HMH leaders reached out to HMSOM leaders for assistance. The HMSOM leadership and faculty quickly organized a literature review elective. APPROACH Eight second-year medical students participated in a literature review elective course to research and synthesize the COVID-19 clinical literature to provide synopses of best practices for various clinical teams. By March 23, students were searching the literature and writing reports independently, mentored by a senior dean (an infectious diseases specialist) and supported by the associate dean of libraries and library team. The library team updated and categorized student reports daily on a website dedicated to the elective. OUTCOMES During the 6-week elective, 8 students produced 70 reports synthesizing the emerging COVID-19 literature to help answer practitioners' clinical questions in real time. One student report was posted on the American Academy of Ophthalmology website. All 70 were published online in Elsevier's health education faculty hub. On course evaluations, students expressed regret about not being directly involved in patient care, but articulated their gratitude to be able to contribute to the clinical teams. NEXT STEPS In June 2020, the students returned to their clinical clerkships as COVID-19 clinical volumes declined and PPE became more available. Students continued to be available to the clinical teams to assist with COVID-19 questions. This literature review elective can serve as a model for other medical schools to use to deploy students to help synthesize the evolving literature on COVID-19 or other rapidly emerging research topics.","Boscamp, Jeffrey R; Duffy, Christopher P; Barsky, Carol; Stanton, Bonita F",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,169,27

Existing research has provided mixed evidence concerning the diagnostic demarcation of AN and AAN. The aim of the present study was to identify research priorities for furthering the understanding of AN and AAN as diagnostic entities. METHOD Employing the Delphi methodology, experts in the field were invited to suggest research questions that need to be explored in the demarcation of AN from AAN. This yielded 24 research areas, that were presented in subsequent rounds where panelists were asked to prioritize areas of primary interest. RESULTS Fifty-three panelists completed all three Delphi rounds. Consensus was only reached on three items considered to be of primary interest: medical, neurobiological, and neurological factors; epidemiology and natural course; and treatment response in AAN compared to AN. In contrast, questions of premorbid weight and determining the need for and nature of a body mass index cutoff differentiating between AAN and AN were seen as being of low priority. DISCUSSION These findings reveal a relatively low degree of consensus on the demarcation of AN from AAN in the field of eating disorders. A reason could be that the definition and use of the AAN category vary in research and clinical practice. In order to achieve further diagnostic clarity, research on the demarcation of AAN and AN should focus on the identified prioritized research areas.","Strand, Mattias; Zvrskovec, Johan; Hübel, Christopher; Peat, Christine M; Bulik, Cynthia M; Birgegård, Andreas",The International journal of eating disorders,169,1

PURPOSE To describe a pharmacist-managed virtual consult service practice model to improve medication safety in a population of rheumatology patients and evaluate its initial impact on guideline compliance. SUMMARY Optimal pharmacologic care of patients with rheumatologic conditions often revolves around the use of specialty medications such as self-injectable biologics and infused therapies, including biologic response modifiers (BRMs), nearly all of which carry risks of serious adverse events due to their immune-suppressive properties. Possible adverse events include serious infections such as reactivation of tuberculosis (TB) and viral hepatitis B (HBV). This articles describes a pharmacist-managed virtual consult service introduced by a large university-affiliated health system in 2018 to integrate clinical, specialty pharmacy, and therapeutic infusion services for proactive medication and safety management for patients with rheumatologic conditions requiring specialty or infused medications. During a 4-month evaluation period, 157 referrals were sent to the consult service; of 137 consults included in the analysis, 42% were for self-injectable biologic medications, 28% were for intra-articular injections, 26% were for infusions, and 4% were for oral specialty medications. Forty-one percent of the pharmacy benefit consult orders required an intervention prior to submission of prior authorization requests. Most interventions (61%) were clinical in nature and involved the pharmacists ensuring that necessary laboratory work, clinical disease activity scoring, or radiographic imaging were completed prior to submission of the consult results for insurer approval. CONCLUSION National rates of HBV screening and TB screening for patients prescribed BRMs continue to be suboptimal. The pharmacist-managed virtual consult service is a novel practice model to increase the screening rate to 100% to ensure the safety and appropriate monitoring of patients who are starting or continued on these complex medications.","Sasnovskaya, Veranika; Kumor, Lisa M; Stubbings, JoAnn; Chevalier, Aimee",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,169,13

In the absence of vaccines that provide complete protection against these viruses, viral surveillance can identify disease burden and target virus-specific preventative measures. Influenza infection, in particular, has significant adverse effects on force readiness. METHODS We tracked the frequency of 16 respiratory viruses at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center tested for during routine patient care using multiplex polymerase chain reaction and rapid antigen testing. We collected data on the date and location of the testing, as well as the age of the individual tested from two consecutive respiratory viral seasons. RESULTS During the first year of data compilation (2017-2018), 2556 tests were performed; 342 (13.4%) were positive for influenza A and 119 (4.7%) were positive for influenza B. After influenza, the most common families of viruses identified were rhino/enterovirus (490 [19.2%]). During the second year (2018-2019), 4,458 tests were run; 564 (12.7%) were positive for influenza A and 35 (0.79%) were positive for influenza B, while rhino/enterovirus was identified in 690 (15.4%). Influenza peaked early during the 2017-2018 season and later during the 2018-2019 season. Importantly, during the 2017-2018 season, the vaccine was less effective for the H3N2 strain circulating that year and viral surveillance quickly identified a hospital-specific outbreak and a larger disease burden. This was in contrast to the 2018-2019 vaccine which exhibited higher effectiveness for circulating strains. CONCLUSION Our data highlight the seasonality of respiratory viruses with a focus on influenza. By tracking respiratory viruses in Department of Defense communities, we may be able to predict when influenza may cause the greatest burden for distinct organizational regions and prescribe with greater precision preventative protocols by location, as well as rapidly determine vaccine efficacy. Our current data suggest that when vaccine strains are mismatched, rapid upfront targeting of antivirals may be warranted, but when the vaccine strains are better matched, late season peaks of disease may indicate waning immunity and should be monitored.","Crouch, Elena; Gonzalez, Jonathan; Jacobs, Erin; Schaecher, Kurt; Kehl, Margaret; Ottolini, Martin; Malloy, Allison",Military medicine,169,7

The current study aimed to evaluate the responses of Th17 and Treg cells in COVID-19 patients compared with the control group. Forty COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients were compared with 40 healthy controls. The frequency of cells, gene expression of related factors, as well as the secretion levels of cytokines, were measured by flow cytometry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques, respectively. The findings revealed a significant increase in the number of Th17 cells, the expression levels of related factors (RAR-related orphan receptor gamma [RORγt], IL-17, and IL-23), and the secretion levels of IL-17 and IL-23 cytokines in COVID-19 patients compared with controls. In contrast, patients had a remarkable reduction in the frequency of Treg cells, the expression levels of correlated factors (Forkhead box protein P3 [FoxP3], transforming growth factor-β [TGF-β], and IL-10), and cytokine secretion levels (TGF-β and IL-10). The ratio of Th17/Treg cells, RORγt/FoxP3, and IL-17/IL-10 had a considerable enhancement in patients compared with the controls and also in dead patients compared with the improved cases. The findings showed that enhanced responses of Th17 cells and decreased responses of Treg cells in 2019-n-CoV patients compared with controls had a strong relationship with hyperinflammation, lung damage, and disease pathogenesis. Also, the high ratio of Th17/Treg cells and their associated factors in COVID-19-dead patients compared with improved cases indicates the critical role of inflammation in the mortality of patients.","Sadeghi, Armin; Tahmasebi, Safa; Mahmood, Arshad; Kuznetsova, Maria; Valizadeh, Hamed; Taghizadieh, Ali; Nazemiyeh, Masoud; Aghebati-Maleki, Leili; Jadidi-Niaragh, Farhad; Abbaspour-Aghdam, Sanaz; Roshangar, Leila; Mikaeili, Haleh; Ahmadi, Majid",Journal of cellular physiology,169,33

Recent measles outbreaks have been attributed to lower-level vaccination coverage among religious minorities, which has inspired targeted as well as wholesale public health interventions and legislation in a range of jurisdictions. The commentary takes the case of self-protective ethnic and religious minority groups, especially Haredi or 'ultra-Orthodox' Jews in the United Kingdom, to address two key aims. First, this commentary flags how damaging representations of religious minorities in recent measles outbreaks can be avoided by better understanding inner processes of vaccine decision-making and acceptance, which can, in turn, help to address hesitancy sustainably and trustfully. Second, the commentary advocates for addressing vaccine hesitancy as part of a broader re-visioning of public health relations with minority groups. This commentary calls on public health services to improve confidence in childhood vaccinations rather than resorting to compulsory (and coercive) vaccination policies in order to address lower-level vaccination coverage. The commentary signposts how essential it is to carefully navigate relationships with minority groups amidst the new forms of public health preparedness that will emerge from the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).","Kasstan, Ben",Anthropology & medicine,169,1

Initial experience with a synthetic sealant PleuraSeal™ after pulmonary resections: a prospective study with retrospective case matched controls.,12.509893,5.9135113,2010,"The cytoplasmic tails of some coronavirus (CoV) spike (S) proteins contain an endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal (ERRS) that can retrieve S proteins from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); this process is thought to accumulate S proteins at the CoV budding site, the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), and to facilitate S protein incorporation into virions. However, we showed previously that porcine epidemic diarrhoea CoV S proteins lacking the ERRS were efficiently incorporated into virions, similar to the original virus. Thus, the precise role of the ERRS in virus assembly remains unclear. Here, the roles of the S protein ERRS in severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) intracellular trafficking and S incorporation into virus-like particles (VLPs) are described. Intracellular trafficking and indirect immunofluorescence analysis suggested that when M protein was present, wild-type S protein (wtS) could be retained in the pre- and post-medial Golgi compartments intracellularly and co-localized with M protein in the Golgi. In contrast, mutant S protein lacking the ERRS was distributed throughout the ER and only partially co-localized with M protein. Moreover, the intracellular accumulation of mutant S protein, particularly at the post-medial Golgi compartment, was significantly reduced compared with wtS. A VLP assay suggested that wtS that reached the post-medial compartment could be returned to the ERGIC for subsequent incorporation into VLPs, while mutant S protein could not. These results suggest that the ERRS of SARS-CoV contributes to intracellular S protein accumulation specifically in the post-medial Golgi compartment and to S protein incorporation into VLPs.","Ujike, Makoto; Huang, Cheng; Shirato, Kazuya; Makino, Shinji; Taguchi, Fumihiro",The Journal of general virology,169,33

With the TSPO (18 kDa translocator protein) positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [(11)C]PBR28, we monitored longitudinally the inflammatory response post-transient cerebral ischemia in rats, using a recently developed rat stroke model that produces isolated focal cortical infarcts with clinical relevance in size and pathophysiology. Six Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 90 min transient endovascular occlusion of the M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery (M2CAO). Animals were imaged with a nanoScan(®) PET/MRI system at 1, 4, 7 and 14 days after M2CAO with a bolus injection of [(11)C]PBR28. In the infarct region, we found a significantly increased uptake of [(11)C]PBR28 on day 4, 7 and 14 compared to day 1 as well as compared to the contralateral cortex. No significant increase was detected in the contralateral cortex during the 14 days of imaging. The activation in the infarct region gradually decreased between day 4 and day 14. In an additional group of animals (n = 26), immunofluorescence studies were performed with antibodies for activated microglia/monocytes (Cd11b), phagocytes (Cd68), astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and TSPO. The TSPO immunofluorescence signal indicated reactive microgliosis post injury, corresponding to PET findings. The present clinically relevant animal model and TSPO PET ligand appear to be well suited for studies on neuroinflammation after ischemic stroke.","Tóth, Miklós; Little, Philip; Arnberg, Fabian; Häggkvist, Jenny; Mulder, Jan; Halldin, Christer; Gulyás, Balázs; Holmin, Staffan",Brain structure & function,169,33

There is limited literature assessing the outcomes of bariatric surgery in a publically funded, North American, multidisciplinary bariatric program. Our objective was to assess outcomes of roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in a publically funded bariatric program through a retrospective review of patient records. Methods. 293 patients spent a median of 13 months attending a multidisciplinary obesity clinic prior to undergoing laparoscopic RYGB surgery. The hospital was a Canadian, publically funded, level 2 trauma center with university teaching services. Results. 79% of the patients were female and the average BMI at first visit to clinic was 55.3 kg/m2. The average decrease in BMI was 19.2 ± 0.9 kg/m(2). This was an average absolute weight loss of 56.1 kg or 35.5% of initial weight. The average excess weight loss was 63.4 ± 20.4%. Improvement or resolution of obesity related comorbidities occurred in 65.9% of type 2 diabetics and in 50% of hypertensive patients. Conclusion. Despite this being an unconventional setting of a publically funded program in a large Canadian teaching hospital, early outcomes following RYGB were appropriate in severely obese patients. Ongoing work will identify areas of improvement for enhanced efficiencies within this system.","Whitlock, Kevin A; Gill, Richdeep S; Ali, Talal; Shi, Xinzhe; Birch, Daniel W; Karmali, Shahzeer",ISRN obesity,169,31

Therefore, the present study is a content analysis of quarantine15 content on Instagram. A total of 668 posts were sampled using the hashtag quarantine15, and systematically analyzed for features related to positive and negative body image, as well as weight stigma. The results showed that the posts containing human figures (57.5 %) showcased individuals who were perceived as lower-weight (88.8 %), White (70.3 %), and women (87 %). Approximately one-third (34.4 %) of the images containing individuals were considered objectifying. Posts also perpetuated the controllability of weight through diet (51.5 %) and physical activity (27.5 %), while 46.9 % expressed dislike towards higher-weight bodies.

We conducted a phase I pilot study to assess the feasibility and safety of performing intravascular hypothermia after definitive intra-arterial reperfusion therapy (IAT). METHODS ReCCLAIM (Reperfusion and Cooling in Cerebral Acute Ischemia) is a prospective single-arm open-label clinical trial conducted between May and August 2012 at Grady Memorial Hospital. Twenty patients with Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) 5-7 and NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score > 13 were enrolled and treated with intravascular cooling immediately after IAT. The incidence of pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, cardiac arrhythmias and postoperative hemorrhages was documented for the entire length of stay. Secondary outcomes included blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown on gadolinium-enhanced MRIs and 90-day modified Rankin scores (mRS). RESULTS The mean age, median NIHSS score and median final infarct volume were 59.7 ± 14.6 years, 19 (IQR16-22) and 78 cm(3) (IQR 16-107), respectively. The average time to the target temperature (33 °C) was 64 ± 50 min. Intracranial hemorrhages were found in three patients, of which one was symptomatic. Evidence of BBB breakdown was observed on 3 of 14 MRIs (21%). Six patients died due to withdrawal of care, whereas six patients (30%) achieved mRS of 0-2 at 90 days. In a binary logistical regression model comparing ReCCLAIM patients with 68 historical controls at our institution, hypothermia was protective against intracerebral hemorrhages (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.56; p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Hypothermia can be safely performed after definitive IAT in patients with large pretreatment core infarcts.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequities for many populations including people with disabilities, and data is needed to develop inclusive public health response policies. OBJECTIVE To identify how COVID-19 has uniquely impacted the lives of adults with disabilities. METHODS 38 participants were recruited through disability advocacy groups and social media. Semi-structured virtual focus groups were conducted with adults (≥18 years) who self-identified as having a disability. Focus groups were conducted for each of six disability sub-groups: vision, hearing, mobility and physical, mental health, cognitive, intellectual, and developmental, and chronic illness. Using inductive coding, major themes were identified and compared across the disability sub-groups. RESULTS Three major themes and thirteen sub-themes were identified from the focus groups. The three major themes comprised: new problems created by the pandemic, obstacles in daily life that were exacerbated by the pandemic, and broader changes to accessibility and disability identity. Sub-themes such as difficulty with COVID-19 testing and regular medical care were reported by participants of all disability sub-groups, while other sub-themes like direct care needs and medical rationing were reported by participants from a subset of the disability sub-groups. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate how the COVID-19 pandemic unequally impacts disabled people. The participants indicated that to fully address their needs, disability perspectives must be included in the public health pandemic response. As new research shows that COVID-19 can cause long-term disability, the urgency to ensure the disability community is part of public health policies will increase.","Epstein, Sabrina; Campanile, Jessica; Cerilli, Caroline; Gajwani, Prateek; Varadaraj, Varshini; Swenor, Bonnielin K",Disability and health journal,169,1

A growing body of research has investigated U-VBF in intervention for developmental SSD; however, diversity in study design, participant characteristics, clinical methods and outcomes complicate the interpretation of this literature. Thus, there is a need for a synthesis and review of the evidence base for using U-VBF in intervention for SSD. AIMS To synthesise and evaluate the research evidence for U-VBF in intervention for developmental SSD. METHODS A systematic review was conducted. Eight electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles published before 2018. Details about study design, participants, intervention procedures, service delivery, intervention intensity and outcomes were extracted from each study that met the inclusion criteria. The included studies were rated using both a critical appraisal tool and for their reporting of intervention detail. MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS Twenty-eight papers, comprising 29 studies, met the inclusion criteria. The most common research design was single-case experimental design (44.8% of studies). The studies included between one and 13 participants (mean = 4.1) who had a mean age of approximately 11 years (range = 4;0-27 years). Within the research evidence, U-VBF intervention was typically provided as part of, or as an adjunct to, other articulatory-based therapy approaches. A range of lingual sounds were targeted in intervention, with 80.6% of participants across all reviewed studies receiving intervention targeting rhotics. Outcomes following therapy were generally positive with the majority of studies reporting that U-VBF facilitated acquisition of targets, with effect sizes ranging from no effect to a large effect. Difficulties with generalisation were observed for some participants. Most studies (79.3%) were categorised as efficacy rather than effectiveness studies and represented lower levels of evidence. Overall, the reviewed studies scored more highly on measures of external validity than internal validity. CONCLUSIONS The evidence base for U-VBF is developing; however, most studies used small sample sizes and lower strength designs. Current evidence indicates that U-VBF may be an effective adjunct to intervention for some individuals whose speech errors persist despite previous intervention.

We aimed to investigate whether a cut-off score of 3 for endovascular treatment within 6 hours of symptom onset is an appropriate predictor of good functional outcome at 3 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS From April 2015 to January 2016, acute ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours of symptom onset were enrolled into this study. Pial arterial filling scores were semi-quantitatively assessed using mpCTA, and clinical and radiological parameters were compared between patients with favorable and unfavorable outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was then performed to investigate the independent association between clinical outcome and pial collateral score, with the predictive power of the latter assessed using C-statistics. RESULTS Of the 38 patients enrolled, 20 (52.6%) had a favorable outcome and 18 had an unfavorable outcome, with the latter group showing a lower mean pial arterial filling score (3.6±0.8 vs. 2.4±1.2, P=0.002). After adjusting for variables with a P-value of <0.1 in univariate analysis (i.e., age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at admission), pial arterial filling scores higher than a cut-off of 2 were found to be independently associated with favorable clinical outcomes (P=0.012). C-statistic analysis confirmed that our model had the highest prediction power when pial arterial filling scores were dichotomized at >2 vs. ≤2. CONCLUSION A pial arterial filling cut-off score of 2 as determined by mpCTA appears to be more suitable for predicting clinical outcomes following endovascular treatment within 6 hours of symptom onset than the cut-off of 3 that had been previously suggested.","Woo, Ho Geol; Jung, Cheolkyu; Sunwoo, Leonard; Bae, Yun Jung; Choi, Byung Se; Kim, Jae Hyoung; Kim, Beom Joon; Han, Moon-Ku; Bae, Hee-Joon; Jung, Seunguk; Cha, Sang-Hoon",Neurointervention,169,1

The author presents statistical data relating to a time span ranging from 1898 to 1935, interpreting them in light of social and sanitary conditions found in the city. The result is an exhaustive picture of the most important actions implemented at city level to prevent tuberculosis and to assist and treat the sick, such as: the creation of seaside hospices conceived by Carlo Livi for children suffering from scrofula, as well as centers committed to the prevention of childhood poverty and malnutrition; the realization of activities in the green areas of the ramparts of the Fortress, upon recommendation by the great hygienist Achille Sclavo; the establishment of a Preventorium on the premises of the Monastery of Santa Maria Maddalena to accommodate children from families that included pulmonary tuberculosis patients, and countless activities carried out by the Anti-TB Dispensary. Of particular interest is the identification of the main cause of high TB incidence in the unhealthy houses located in some areas of Siena's district, which, in 1930 engendered a lively debate hinging upon the notion of building restoration.","Orsini, D",Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,169,1

Currently, no licensed therapies exist to treat filovirus infections, which cause up to 90% mortality in human cases. To facilitate development of antivirals against these viruses, we established two distinct screening platforms based on MARV and EBOV reverse genetics systems that express secreted Gaussia luciferase (gLuc). The first platform is a mini-genome replicon to screen viral replication inhibitors using gLuc quantification in a BSL-2 setting. The second platform is complementary to the first and expresses gLuc as a reporter gene product encoded in recombinant infectious MARV and EBOV, thereby allowing for rapid quantification of viral growth during treatment with antiviral compounds. We characterized these viruses by comparing luciferase activity to virus production, and validated luciferase activity as an authentic real-time measure of viral growth. As proof of concept, we adapt both mini-genome and infectious virus platforms to high-throughput formats, and demonstrate efficacy of several antiviral compounds. We anticipate that both approaches will prove highly useful in the development of anti-filovirus therapies, as well as in basic research on the filovirus life cycle.","Uebelhoer, Luke S; Albariño, César G; McMullan, Laura K; Chakrabarti, Ayan K; Vincent, Joel P; Nichol, Stuart T; Towner, Jonathan S",Antiviral research,169,27

Suppressing the activity of telomerase, a telomere-synthesizing enzyme, and maintaining short telomeres is a protective mechanism against cancer in humans. In most human somatic cells, the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is repressed and telomerase activity is inhibited. This leads to the progressive shortening of telomeres and inhibition of cell growth in a process called replicative senescence. Most types of primary cancer exhibit telomerase activation, which allows uncontrolled cell proliferation. Previous research indicates that TERT activation also affects cancer development through activities other than the canonical function of mediating telomere elongation. Recent studies have improved the understanding of the structure and function of telomeres and telomerase as well as key mechanisms underlying the activation of TERT and its role in oncogenesis. These advances led to a search for drugs that inhibit telomerase as a target for cancer therapy. The present review article summarizes the organization and function of telomeres, their role in carcinogenesis, and advances in telomerase-targeted therapy.","Trybek, Tomasz; Kowalik, Artur; Góźdź, Stanisław; Kowalska, Aldona",Oncology letters,169,1

The objective of this study was to describe its evolution using indirect calorimetry. METHODS Prospective observational pilot study including ventilated adult patients with septic shock admitted in a surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Metabolic data were collected using the COSMED Q-NRG + ® calorimeter: carbon dioxide production (VCO2), oxygen consumption (VO2), resting energy expenditure (REE), respiratory quotient (RQ) and the rate of substrate utilization (proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates). The main criterion was the evolution of the energy deficit (dE) from D1 to D6. RESULTS In total, 34 patients were included and 15 patients (age: 57.6 ± 12.8 years; Simplified Acute Physiology Score II: 52 ± 11) were eligible for final analysis. Time for initiation of nutritional support was 2.5 ± 1.5 days. The dE improved during the study period (slope = 2.9 [1.8; 4.2]; p < 0.001). The REE remained stable during the first week with no significant variation (slope = -0.16 [-1.49; 0.79]; p = 0.78). The RQ remained stable overall (slope = 0.01 [0.00; 0.03]; p = 0.10). The substrates utilization significantly changed at D3 in favor of protein consumption (slope = 6.50 [4.44; 8.85]; p < 0.001) with an overall significant decrease in the consumption of non-protein substrates. CONCLUSION Energy deficit improved while REE and RQ remained relatively stable during the first week of ICU stay. The significance of the variations of substrates consumption was unclear. These preliminary results should be further explored with larger studies.","Occhiali, Emilie; Urli, Maximilien; Pressat-Laffouilhère, Thibaut; Achamrah, Najate; Veber, Benoit; Clavier, Thomas",European journal of clinical nutrition,169,17

Conventional surgical approaches are technique sensitive and often result in alteration of the soft tissue architecture, which then requires additional corrective surgical procedures. This case series report presents the ability of flapless surgical techniques combined with a growth factor-enhanced bone matrix to provide esthetic ridge preservation at the time of extraction for compromised sockets. CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS When considering esthetic dental implant therapy, preservation, or further enhancement of the available tissue support at the time of tooth extraction may provide an improved esthetic outcome with reduced postoperative sequelae and decreased treatment duration. Advances in minimally invasive surgical techniques combined with recombinant growth factor technology offer an alternative for bone reconstruction while maintaining the gingival architecture for enhanced esthetic outcome. The combination of freeze-dried bone allograft (FDBA) and rhPDGF-BB (platelet-derived growth factor-BB) provides a growth-factor enhanced matrix to induce bone and soft tissue healing. CONCLUSIONS The use of a growth-factor enhanced matrix is an option for minimally invasive ridge preservation procedures for sites with advanced bone loss. Further studies including randomized clinical trials are needed to better understand the extent and limits of these procedures. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The use of minimally invasive techniques with growth factors for esthetic ridge preservation reduces patient morbidity associated with more invasive approaches and increases the predictability for enhanced patient outcomes. By reducing the need for autogenous bone grafts the use of this technology is favorable for patient acceptance and ease of treatment process for esthetic dental implant therapy.","Nevins, Marc L; Said, Sherif",Journal of esthetic and restorative dentistry : official publication of the American Academy of Esthetic Dentistry ...

This may provide increased access to diabetes health care in certain settings. However, health care disparities continue to challenge availability of diabetes technologies for underprivileged communities. We report our experience with two patients providing diabetes care effectively and preventing hospital admissions by using telehealth. Methods: Two adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D): one new onset and the other one with established T1D are presented where telehealth facilitated by Clarity Software and the ""Share"" feature with the use of Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for management of diabetic ketosis and hyperglycemia. Results: Both patients were managed effectively virtually despite higher risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Shared glucose data through CGM facilitated frequent insulin dose adjustments, increased fluid and carbohydrate intake, and prevented hospital admissions in both cases. In the case of new onset patient with T1D, most of the education was done remotely by certified diabetes care and education specialists. Conclusion: Acute diabetes complication like DKA increases morbidity and mortality in addition to adding cost to the health care system. The current pandemic of COVID-19 has allowed newer ways (with the help of newer technologies) to manage high-risk patients with T1D and DKA through telehealth and may result in lasting benefits to people with T1D.","Peters, Anne L; Garg, Satish",Diabetes technology & therapeutics,169,32

However, high costs for mono- or combination therapies, associated with adverse effects or possible development of resistance in some patients, warrant further development and modification to gain more flexibility for this immunotherapy approach. An attractive alternative to passive immunization with therapeutic antibodies might be active immunization with mimotopes (B-cell peptides) representing the mAbs' binding epitopes, to activate the patient's own anti-tumor immune response following immunization. Here, we identified and examined the feasibility of inducing anti-tumor effects in vivo following active immunization with a mimotope of the immune checkpoint programmed cell death 1 (PD1), alone or in combination with a Her-2/neu B-cell peptide vaccine. Overlapping peptides spanning the extracellular domains of human PD1 (hPD1) were used to identify hPD1-derived mimotopes, using the therapeutic mAb Nivolumab as a proof of concept. Additionally, for in vivo evaluation in a tumor mouse model, a mouse PD1 (mPD1)-derived mimotope was identified using an anti-mPD1 mAb with mPD1/mPDL-1 blocking capacity. The identified mimotopes were characterized by in vitro assays, including a reporter cell-based assay, and their anti-tumor effects were evaluated in a syngeneic tumor mouse model stably expressing human Her-2/neu. The identified PD1-derived mimotopes were shown to significantly block the mAbs' capacity in inhibiting the respective PD1/PD-L1 interactions. A significant reduction in tumor growth in vivo was observed following active immunization with the mPD1-derived mimotope, associated with a significant reduction in proliferation and increased apoptotic rates in the tumors. Particularly, combined vaccination with the mPD1-derived mimotope and a multiple B-cell epitope Her-2/neu vaccine potentiated the vaccine's anti-tumor effect. Our results suggest active immunization with mimotopes of immune checkpoint inhibitors either as monotherapy or as combination therapy with tumor-specific vaccines, as a new strategy for cancer treatment.","Tobias, Joshua; Battin, Claire; De Sousa Linhares, Annika; Lebens, Michael; Baier, Karin; Ambroz, Katharina; Drinić, Mirjana; Högler, Sandra; Inic-Kanada, Aleksandra; Garner-Spitzer, Erika; Preusser, Matthias; Kenner, Lukas; Kundi, Michael; Zielinski, Christoph C; Steinberger, Peter; Wiedermann, Ursula",Frontiers in immunology,169,4

Lungs of mice that had recovered from pneumococcal infections did not contain organized tertiary lymphoid organs, but did have plasma cells and noncirculating memory B cells. The latter expressed distinctive surface markers (including CD69, PD-L2, CD80, and CD73) and were poised to secrete antibodies upon stimulation. Human lungs also contained B cells with a resident memory phenotype. In mice recovered from pneumococcal pneumonia, depletion of PD-L2+ B cells, including lung BRM cells, diminished bacterial clearance and the level of pneumococcus-reactive antibodies in the lung.

Our previous study demonstrated that icariin (ICA) might have a beneficial effect on the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) of patients with steroid-associated osteonecrosis. In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of ICA associated with the potential enhancement of osteogenesis and anti-adipogenesis in GC-related ONFH. METHODS In vitro cell proliferation was evaluated by CCK-8 assay. Alizarin red S and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were used to measure osteogenic differentiation, while adipogenic differentiation was revealed by oil red O staining and TG content assay. The expression level of osteogenesis-associated genes and PPARγ was evaluated by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence. A total of 30 female SD rats were randomly separated into three groups: a control group, a methylprednisolone (MPS) group and a MPS + ICA group. Serum ALP and TG (triglyceride), micro-CT scanning, histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed in the animal model. RESULTS In the in vitro study, ICA promoted proliferation, improved osteogenic differentiation and suppressed adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs treated with MPS. The group treated with MPS and 10-6 M ICA expressed higher levels of Runx2, ALP, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2, and OC and lower expression of PPARγ than the MPS group. In the in vivo study, ICA prevented bone loss in a rat model of GC-related ONFH as shown by micro-CT scanning, histological and immunohistochemical analyses. CONCLUSIONS ICA is an effective compound for promoting bone repair and preventing or delaying the progression of GC-associated ONFH in rats. This effect can be explained by its ability to improve the balance between adipogenesis and osteogenesis, indicating that ICA is an effective candidate for management of GC-associated ONFH.","Huang, Zengfa; Cheng, Cheng; Cao, Beibei; Wang, Jing; Wei, Hui; Liu, Xianzhe; Han, Yu; Yang, Shuhua; Wang, Xiang","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",169,26

Recent studies demonstrated that a target-controlled infusion of remifentanil effectively suppresses coughing induced by the endotracheal tube. We investigated the EC95 of remifentanil for smooth emergence without coughing from propofol anesthesia in patients undergoing transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 41 patients undergoing transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, aged 20 to 65 years, with an ASA physical status of I or II, were enrolled. For all participants, anesthesia was induced and maintained with a target-controlled infusion of remifentanil and propofol using predicted effect-site concentration (Ce). A biased coin design up-and-down sequential allocation and isotonic regression method were used to determine the remifentanil EC95 to prevent emergence coughing. In addition, we observed recovery profiles after anesthesia. RESULTS According to the study design, 19 patients received remifentanil 2.6 ng/mL Ce and 22 patients received a lower Ce, ranging from 1.0 to 2.2 ng/mL. The EC95 of remifentanil to prevent coughing was estimated as 2.51 ng/mL (95% confidence interval, 2.28-2.57 ng/mL). Despite the exclusion of 1 case because of delayed emergence, 17 of 18 patients receiving 2.6 ng/mL of remifentanil had bradypnea (<10 breaths/min) until 3 minutes after extubation. However, end-tidal carbon dioxide was maintained below 55 mm Hg during anesthetic emergence and respiratory rate recovered within 20 minutes of admission to the postanesthetic care unit. CONCLUSIONS The EC95 of remifentanil for smooth emergence from anesthesia was 2.51 ng/mL after transsphenoidal hypophysectomy.","Choi, Seung Ho; Min, Kyeong Tae; Lee, Jeong-Rim; Choi, Kwan Woong; Han, Kyung-Hwa; Kim, Eui Hyun; Oh, Hye Jin; Lee, Jae Hoon",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,169,5

The only factors related to greater willingness to tele-assistance were male gender (37% vs 18.8%; P = .03) and a higher academic preparation level in favour of higher technical studies (35.9%) and university studies (32.4%) opposite to the rest (P = .043). The rest of variables studied, job status, labour regimen, diagnostic group and consultation type did not show any relationship. Conclusions: A vast majority of patients answered favourably to almost all the items of the survey. However, only 26.1% of them would choose a model of tele-assistance without restrictions.","Blanco Terés, Lara; Cerdán Santacruz, Carlos; García Septiem, Javier; Maqueda González, Rocío; Lopesino González, José María; Correa Bonito, Alba; Martín-Pérez, Elena",Surgical innovation,169,1

Our study objectives were to determine the frequency of visits before contraception was discussed/initiated, and to assess factors affecting primary care contraception provision. METHODS A retrospective chart review (January 2009-June 2019) was conducted for preventive, follow-up and sick visits; Title X confidential visits were excluded. Questions about method at start, end of visit were asked. Nonparametric median tests (for continuous variables) and chi-squared tests (for categorical variables) assessed for differences for age, race, patient gender, insurance type, visit type, provider gender. The IRB approved the study as exempt. RESULTS Patients (n=12,619; median=15 years; 58% female) were seen in primary care clinic and providers asked about contraception for 82% of visits and averaged three visits before contraception was discussed. For patients asked about contraception, 60% were using a contraceptive method; 15% left on a new method (24.9% LARC). For patients not using contraception, 39.9% left on a method. Patients asked about contraception were female, older, Hispanic, had public insurance, and were seen by female provider (p<.001). Follow up/sick visits represented < 20% of patients asked about contraception. CONCLUSIONS Multiple visits occur before contraception is discussed in adolescent primary care, and factors including age, race, gender affect these discussions. Strategies to increase contraception discussions at all visits is essential as adolescents do not always present for yearly visits.","Woods, Jennifer Leigh; Sheeder, Jeanelle L",Journal of pediatric and adolescent gynecology,169,27

MATERIAL AND METHODS The Beck anxiety inventory and a clinical activities scale were utilized as data collection tools and distributed to neurosurgeons in Turkey as an online survey. Descriptive statistical methods, significance tests and correlation and regression analyses were employed to analyze the data. The data analysis was carried out in a 95% confidence interval Results: Of the 240 neurosurgeons who participated in the study, 63.8% had encountered cases of COVID-19 and 53.8% had handled patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The study results showed that the pandemic did not cause anxiety in 62.9% of the respondents, but it caused mild anxiety in 13.8% and moderate anxiety in 12.12%. The findings also revealed a low linear correlation between the anxiety values and occupational anxiety of the neurosurgeons and low inverse correlation between anxiety values and the protection factor in the pandemic period. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has caused serious disruptions in the routine functioning of neurosurgery clinics and changes in the attitudes of neurosurgeons. Healthcare organizations should take the necessary precautions and measures to resolve the anxiety problems of healthcare professionals, such as providing professional support, and ensure that they can work in a safer environment.","Yilmaz, Ali; Karakoyun, Durmuş Oğuz; IŞik, Hasan Serdar; Bostan, Sedat",Turkish neurosurgery,169,4

Breeding of resistant/tolerant tomato cultivars could be an effective strategy for T. absoluta management but, despite the economic importance of tomato, very limited information is available about its response to this treat. To elucidate the defense mechanisms to herbivore feeding a comparative analysis was performed between a tolerant and susceptible cultivated tomato at both morphological and transcriptome level to highlight constitutive leaf barriers, molecular and biochemical mechanisms to counter the effect of T. absoluta attack. RESULTS The tolerant genotype showed an enhanced constitutive barrier possibly as result of the higher density of trichomes and increased inducible reactions upon mild infestation thanks to the activation/repression of key transcription factors regulating genes involved in cuticle formation and cell wall strength as well as of antinutritive enzymes, and genes involved in the production of chemical toxins and bioactive secondary metabolites. CONCLUSIONS Overall, our findings suggest that tomato resilience to the South America pinworm is achieved by a combined strategy between constitutive and induced defense system. A well-orchestrated modulation of plant transcription regulation could ensure a trade-off between defense needs and fitness costs. Our finding can be further exploited for developing T. absoluta tolerant cultivars, acting as important component of integrated pest management strategy for more sustainable production.","D'Esposito, Daniela; Manzo, Daniele; Ricciardi, Alessandro; Garonna, Antonio Pietro; De Natale, Antonino; Frusciante, Luigi; Pennacchio, Francesco; Ercolano, Maria Raffaella",BMC plant biology,169,16

As the disease continues to spread worldwide, little is known about the country-level factors affecting the transmission in the early weeks. The present study objective was to explore the country-level factors, including government actions that explain the variation in the cumulative cases of COVID-19 within the first 15 days since the first case reported. Using publicly available sources, country socioeconomic, demographic and health-related risk factors, together with government measures to contain COVID-19 spread, were analysed as predictors of the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases at three time points (t = 5, 10 and 15) since the first case reported (n = 134 countries). Drawing on negative binomial multivariate regression models, HDI, healthcare expenditure and resources, and the variation in the measures taken by the governments, significantly predicted the incidence risk ratios of COVID-19 cases at the three time points. The estimates were robust to different modelling techniques and specifications. Although wealthier countries have elevated human development and healthcare capacity in respect to their counterparts (low- and middle-income countries) the early implementation of effective and incremental measures taken by the governments are crucial to controlling the spread of COVID-19 in the early weeks.","Allel, Kasim; Tapia-Muñoz, Thamara; Morris, Walter",Global public health,169,28

Two-dimensional and three-dimensional angiography can reveal information about flow and aneurysm obliteration, but may be limited by beam hardening, overlapping vessels, and image degradation in the region of metallic implants. In this study, we investigated the combination of a collimated volumetric imaging (volume of interest, VOI) protocol followed by metal artifact reduction (MAR) post-processing to evaluate the correct positioning of stents, flow diverters, coils, and clips while limiting the radiation dose to the patient. METHODS 9 patients undergoing 10 procedures were included in our study. All patients underwent endovascular or surgical treatment of a cerebral aneurysm involving stents, flow diverting stents, coils, and/or clips followed by either immediate or early postoperative evaluation of our protocol. RESULTS Image datasets corrected for metallic artifacts (VOI-MAR) were judged to be better-a statistically significant finding-than image datasets only corrected for field of view truncation (VOI alone). Qualitatively, images were more interpretable and informative with regards to device position and apposition to the vessel wall for those cases involving a pipeline, and with regards to encroachment on the parent artery and possible residual aneurysm, in all cases. CONCLUSIONS VOI acquisition combined with MAR post-processing provides for accurate and informative evaluation of cerebral aneurysm treatment while limiting the radiation dose to patients.","Duckworth, Edward A M; Nickele, Chris; Schafer, Sebastian; Bauer, Sebastian; Scholz, Bernhard; Elijovich, Lucas; Hoit, Daniel; Doss, Vinodh T; Arthur, Adam S",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,169,27

Treatments by pharmacological interventions have been reported to impart negative implications on maternal and fetal health outcomes. Therefore, the use of psychotherapeutic interventions to bypass these side-effects and manage depression, anxiety has received a lot of attention. A meta-statistical consensus regarding the intervention is available, but with several limitations. In this study, we attempt to address these limitations and provide the current state of evidence evaluating the influence of psychotherapy on antenatal depression, anxiety, and maternal quality of life. OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the effects of psychotherapy on depression, anxiety, and maternal quality of life during the antenatal stage of pregnancy. METHODS A systematic identification of literature was performed according to PRISMA guidelines on four academic databases: MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. A meta-analysis evaluated the influence of psychotherapy on depression, anxiety, and maternal quality of life as compared to conventional obstetric care. RESULTS Out of 1146 records, 22 articles including 2146 pregnant women (mean age: 28.6 ± 2.8 years) were included in this review. This systematic review presents a 1b level of evidence supporting the use of psychotherapy for reducing depression, anxiety and enhancing maternal quality of life.

This might help showing which comorbidity might pose the patients at risk of more severe symptoms. Methods We searched all relevant databases on April 7th, 2020 using the keywords (""novel coronavirus"" OR COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus) AND (comorbidities OR clinical characteristics OR epidemiologic*). We reviewed 33 papers' full text out of 1053 papers. There were 32 papers from China and 1 from Taiwan. There was no language or study level limit. Prevalence of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancies, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic liver disease and smoking were extracted to measure the pooled estimates. We used OpenMeta and used random-effect model to do a single arm meta-analysis. Results The mean age of the diagnosed patients was 51 years. The male to female ratio was 55 to 45. The most prevalent finding in the confirmed COVID-19 patients was hypertension, which was found in 1/5 of the patients (21%). Other most prevalent finding was diabetes mellitus (DM) in 11%, cerebrovascular disease in 2.4%, cardiovascular disease in 5.8%, chronic kidney disease in 3.6%, chronic liver disease in 2.9%, chronic pulmonary disease in 2.0%, malignancy in 2.7%, and smoking in 8.7% of the patients. Conclusion COVID-19 infection seems to be affecting every race, sex, age, irrespective of health status. The risk of symptomatic and severe disease might be higher due to the higher age which is usually accompanied with comorbidities. However, comorbidities do not seem to be the prerequisite for symptomatic and severe COVID-19 infection, except hypertension.","Baradaran, Ashkan; Ebrahimzadeh, Mohammad H; Baradaran, Aslan; Kachooei, Amir R",The archives of bone and joint surgery,169,16

The characterization and understanding of the inflammatory metabolic pathways involved into volatile organic compounds (VOCs) production could bring exhaled breath analysis into clinical practice and thus open new therapeutic routes for inflammatory diseases. In this study, lung inflammation was simulated in vitro using A549 epithelial cells. We compared the VOC production from A549 epithelial cells after a chemically induced oxidative stress in vitro, exposing the cells to H2O2, and a biological stress, exposing the cells to an inflammatory pool of sputum supernatants. Special attention was devoted to define proper negative and positive controls (8 different types) for our in vitro models, including healthy sputum co-culture. Sputum from 25 asthmatic and 8 healthy patients were collected to create each pool of supernatants. Each sample type was analyzed in 4 replicates using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography hyphenated to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC-TOFMS). This approach offers high resolving power for complex VOC mixtures. According to the type of inflammation induced, significantly different VOCs were produced by the epithelial cells compared to all controls. For both chemical and biological challenges, an increase of carbonyl compounds (54%) and hydrocarbons (31%) was observed. Interestingly, only the biological inflammation model showed a significant cell proliferation together with an increased VOC production linked to asthma airway inflammation. This study presents a complete GC×GC-TOFMS workflow for in vitro VOC analysis, and its potential to characterize complex lung inflammatory mechanisms.","Zanella, Delphine; Henket, Monique; Schleich, Florence; Dejong, Thibaut; Louis, Renaud; Focant, Jean-François; Stefanuto, Pierre-Hugues",The Analyst,169,16

In the current study, we assessed the agreement between an independent core laboratory and the operators regarding angiographic appearance in a recent randomized, controlled trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were derived from the Cerecyte Coil Trial. Angiographic images of each coiled aneurysm, taken immediately after embolization and at 5- to 7-month follow-up, were evaluated by the operator at the treating center and by an independent neuroradiologist at the core laboratory. For the purpose of this study, images were interpreted on a 3-point scale to provide uniformity for analysis; grade 1: complete occlusion, grade 2: neck remnant; and grade 3: sac filling. ""Unfavorable angiographic appearance"" was defined as grade 3 at follow-up or interval worsening of grade between the 2 time points. RESULTS The study included 434 aneurysms. Immediately after embolization, grade 3 was reported by operators in 39 (9%) compared with 52 (12%) by the core laboratory (P = .159). On follow-up, grade 3 was reported by operators in 44 (10%) compared with 81 (19%) by the core laboratory (P < .0001). Overall, operators noted unfavorable angiographic appearance in 78 (18%) compared with 134 (31%) by the core laboratory (P < .0001). At every time point, agreement between the core laboratory and the operators was slight. CONCLUSIONS Unfavorable angiographic appearance was noted almost twice as frequently by an independent core laboratory as compared with the operators. Planning of trials and interpretation of published studies should be done with careful attention to the mode of angiographic appearance interpretation.","Rezek, I; Lingineni, R K; Sneade, M; Molyneux, A J; Fox, A J; Kallmes, D F",AJNR.

To cope with both the complexity of multimorbidity and the ageing population health care systems needs to adapt to the aging population and improve the coordination of long-term services. The objectives of this review were to synthezise how older people with multimorbidity experiences integrations of health care services and to identify barriers towards continuity of care when multimorbid. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in February 2018 by in Scopus, Embase, Cinahl, and Medline using the PRISMA guidelines. INCLUSION CRITERIA studies exploring patients' point of view, ≥65 and multi-morbid. Quality assessment was conducted using COREQ. Thematic synthesis was done. RESULTS Two thousand thirty studies were identified, with 75 studies eligible for full text, resulting in 9 included articles, of generally accepted quality. Integration of health care services was successful when the patients felt listened to on all the aspects of being individuals with multimorbidity and when they obtained help from a care coordinator to prioritize their appointments. However, they felt frustrated when they did not have easy access to their health providers, when they were not listened to, and when they felt they were discharged too early. These frustrations were also identified as barriers to continuity of care. CONCLUSIONS Health care systems needs to adapt to people with multimorbidity and find solutions on ways to create flexible systems that are able to help older patients with multimorbidity, meet their individual needs and their desire to be involved in decisions regarding their care.

METHODS Seventy-one patients with 87 HCC lesions (mean +/- SD; 19.5 +/- 9.6 mm) underwent CEUS using Sonazoid and dynamic CT after radiofrequency ablation (n = 55), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (n = 22), or radiofrequency ablation combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (n = 10). Two hepatologists (observer 1; 10 years of experience, and 2; 20 years of experience) reviewed the CEUS and dynamic CT images independently and evaluated presence or absence of the local recurrence. Diagnostic performance for the local recurrence was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS The Az value for dynamic CT was significantly lower in observer 1 than 2 (p < 0.05). The sensitivity of CEUS was 79% in observer 1 and 83.9% in observer 2, and that of dynamic CT was 83.9% and 90.3%, respectively. The specificity of CEUS was 96%, and that of dynamic CT was 92%, in both observers. CONCLUSION This study suggests that CEUS using Sonazoid is less affected by the observer's experience and is more accurate in the diagnosis of local recurrence after treatment for HCC than dynamic CT.","Shiozawa, Kazue; Watanabe, Manabu; Takayama, Ryuji; Takahashi, Masayoshi; Wakui, Noritaka; Iida, Kazunari; Sumino, Yasukiyo",Journal of clinical ultrasound : JCU,169,23

This shift of focus can further strengthen personalization of transfusion therapy, by revealing probable links between donor biology, RBC storage lesion profile, and posttransfusion performance. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We performed a paired correlation analysis of osmotic fragility in freshly drawn RBCs and during cold storage in different preservative solutions at weekly intervals until unit's expiration date (n = 231), or following 24 h reconstitution in allogeneic plasma (n = 32) from healthy controls or transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia patients. RESULTS We observed exceptional correlation profiles (r > 0.700, p < 10-5 in most cases) of RBC osmotic fragility in the ensemble of samples, as well as in subgroups characterized by distinct genetic backgrounds (sex, beta-thalassemia traits, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency) and storage strategies (additive solutions, whole blood, RBC concentrates). The mean corpuscular fragility (MCF) of fresh and stored RBCs at each storage time significantly correlated with the MCF of stored RBCs measured at all subsequent time points of the storage period (e.g., MCF values of storage day 21 correlated with those of storage days 28, 35 and 42).

While electromyography (EMG) is widely used to detect individual muscular contributions, sweat and relative sensor movements degrade the quality of the signal over time. In this paper, we bypass the problems created with the skin contact analyzing the muscular activation with Archimedean Spiral (AS) electrodes. We compare traditional EMG electrodes with AS electrodes, stacked up in textile embroidered layers to improve their functionality, and eventually adding a layer of cloth/silicon between the electrodes and the human skin to ascertain the feasibility of the method. We use n=9 volunteers to perform a loaded wrist extension and record signals from the extensor digitorum muscle group. We evaluate the amplitude and noise from all results and conclude that the AS electrode is capable of detecting muscular activation without touching the skin. As part of a low-cost prosthetic initiative, this EMG alternative can be potentially embedded to the prosthetic socket to improve usage and reduce adaptation problems.","Mangezi, Andrew; Rosendo, Andre; Howard, Matthew; Stopforth, Riaan",IEEE ...

In the United Kingdom, most students worked in roles similar to Healthcare Assistants: helping to support nurses in providing patient care. Although the current situation is exceptional, with medical students eager to contribute to the COVID-19 response, they have also gained valuable experience in interprofessional collaboration. By working closely with nurses, medical students have gained practical understanding of the different roles within the hospital environment and been involved in providing hands-on care to patients. The experience of the current pandemic has shown the willingness of medical students to volunteer in Healthcare Assistant roles and demonstrated the ability of hospitals to successfully integrate students into established nursing teams. This short report provides a reflection on the advantages of these placements and argues for their continuation in future practice.","Buckland, Rosalyn",Journal of interprofessional care,169,16

We previously undertook two meta-analyses on post-prandial and chronic responses to isoenergetic replacement of fructose for sucrose or glucose in food or beverages (Evans et al. 2017, AJCN 106:506-518 & 519-529). Here we report on the results of an updated search with a complete re-extraction of previously identified studies and a new and more detailed subgroup-analysis and meta-regression. We identified two studies that were published after our previous analyses, which slightly altered effect sizes and conclusions. Overall, the isoenergetic substitution of fructose for glucose resulted in a statistically significant but clinically irrelevant reduction in fasting blood glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations. A subgroup analysis by diabetes status revealed much larger reductions in fasting blood glucose in people with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. However, each of these subgroups contained only a single study. In people with a healthy body mass index, fructose consumption was associated with statistically significant, but clinically irrelevant reductions in fasting blood glucose and fasting blood insulin. Meta-regression of the outcomes by a number of pre-identified and post-hoc covariates revealed some sources of heterogeneity, such as year of publication, age of the participants at baseline, and participants' sex. However, the small number of studies and the large number of potential covariates precluded detailed investigations of effect sizes in different subpopulations. For example, well-controlled, high quality studies in people with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes are still lacking. Taken together, the available data suggest that chronic consumption of fructose is neither more beneficial, nor more harmful than equivalent doses of sucrose or glucose for glycemic and other metabolic outcomes.","Zafar, Mohammad Ishraq; Frese, Michael; Mills, Kerry E",Frontiers in nutrition,169,20

Aim To compare three inexperienced surgeons in terms of the learning curve without supervision. Material and methods Patients' data, which were from consecutive laparoscopic TEP hernioplasties between December 2017 and February 2020, were analysed retrospectively. The primary outcome was to compare the learning curve of three surgeons (Surgeon A, B, and C) in terms of complications, conversion, and duration of surgery. Secondary outcomes were recurrence rates. Results A total of 299 patients were included in the study. Conversion and intraoperative complication rates decreased after the first 60 cases (from 10% to 2.5%, p = 0.013 and from 9% to 2.5%, p = 0.027, respectively). The mean operative time reached a plateau of less than 40 min after 51-81 cases (Surgeon A 51, B 71, and C 81 cases). Ageing was a risk factor for intraoperative complications and recurrence (p < 0.001, p = 0.008, respectively), and higher body mass index (BMI) was a risk factor for conversion (p = 0.004). Age ≥ 60 years compared to age < 60 years increased intraoperative complications five-fold and recurrence six-fold (p = 0.001). On the other hand, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 increased the possibility of conversion to open surgery nine-fold (p < 0.001). In addition, a positive correlation was found between the operative time and the BMI and VAS score (p = 0.004, p = 0.015, respectively). Conclusions In order to reach the plateau in the operative time during the TEP learning curve period, more than 50 cases should be experienced, whereas more than 60 cases are needed for conversion, intraoperative complications, and recurrence.","Goksoy, Beslen; Azamat, Ibrahim Fethi; Yilmaz, Gokhan; Sert, Ozlem Zeliha; Onur, Ender",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,169,0

We evaluated the performance characteristics of EUS-FNA in obtaining a diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy. METHODS We performed a multicenter study of patients who underwent EUS-FNA for a solid pancreatic mass. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided FNA was standardized using a 25-gauge needle, slow-pull stylet technique for specimen acquisition, and on-site cytopathology. For the primary analysis, only malignant cytology was regarded as positive. A secondary analysis was performed in which malignant and/or suspicious cytology was regarded as positive. RESULTS A total of 138 patients underwent EUS-FNA. In the primary analysis, the sensitivity of EUS-FNA for malignancy was 56.7% on first pass, 73.3% on second pass, 83.3% on third pass, 89.2% on fourth pass, and 90.8% on fifth pass, with no increase beyond the fifth pass. In the secondary analysis, the sensitivity was 75.0% on first pass, 89.2% on second pass, 93.3% on third pass, and 95.8% on fourth pass, with no increase beyond the fourth pass. No significant relationship was seen between lesion size and diagnostic yield. CONCLUSIONS Using a 25-gauge needle, the maximal diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA for a solid pancreatic mass is reached after 4 needle passes.","Ge, Phillip S; Wani, Sachin; Watson, Rabindra R; Sedarat, Alireza; Kim, Stephen; Marshall, Carrie; Wilson, Robert H; Makker, Jitin; Mohamadnejad, Mehdi; Komanduri, Srinadh; Muthusamy, V Raman",Pancreas,169,16

CHIKV has been emerging globally, while neither a vaccine nor antiviral medication is available. The anti-parasitic drug suramin was previously shown to inhibit CHIKV replication. In this study we aimed to obtain more detailed insight into its mechanism of action. We found that suramin interacts with virions and can inhibit virus binding to cells. It also appeared to inhibit post-attachment steps of the infection process, likely by preventing conformational changes of the envelope glycoproteins required for fusion and the progression of infection. Suramin-resistant CHIKV strains were selected and genotyping and reverse genetics experiments indicated that mutations in E2 were responsible for resistance. The substitutions N5R and H18Q were reverse engineered in the E2 glycoprotein in order to understand their role in resistance. The binding of suramin-resistant viruses with these two E2 mutations was inhibited by suramin like that of wild-type virus, but they appeared to be able to overcome the post-attachment inhibitory effect of suramin. Conversely, a virus with a G82R mutation in E2 (implicated in attenuation of vaccine strain 181/25), which renders it dependent on the interaction with heparan sulfate for entry, was more sensitive to suramin than wild-type virus. Using molecular modelling studies, we predicted the potential suramin binding sites on the mature spikes of the chikungunya virion. We conclude that suramin interferes with CHIKV entry by interacting with the E2 envelope protein, which inhibits attachment and also interferes with conformational changes required for fusion.","Albulescu, Irina C; White-Scholten, Leonie; Tas, Ali; Hoornweg, Tabitha E; Ferla, Salvatore; Kovacikova, Kristina; Smit, Jolanda M; Brancale, Andrea; Snijder, Eric J; van Hemert, Martijn J",Viruses,169,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS Since July 2020 and promoted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented the use of DSCT after cerebrovascular CT angiography (CTA) among patients with AIS using a dual-layer spectral CT. We explored the presence of CE sources, as well as late myocardium iodine enhancement (LIE) and pulmonary thromboembolism. Among patients further undergoing transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) or cardiac CTA, we explored the diagnostic performance. RESULTS Fifty consecutive patients with AIS who underwent DSCT after cerebrovascular CTA comprised the patient population. The confidence degree for excluding cardiac thrombi was significantly higher than for LIE (4.4±0.8 vs. 3.4±1.3, p<0.0001). DSCT identified a CE source in 4 (8%) and LIE in 24 (48%) patients. The iodine ratio of CE sources was significantly lower compared to the left atrial appendage of patients with no CE sources (0.25±0.1 mg/mL vs. 0.91±0.2 mg/mL, p<0.0001). TEE/cardiac CT, performed in 20 (40%) patients, identified a CE source in 5 (25%) cases, whereas DSCT identified 4 (20%), leading to a sensitivity and specificity of 80% (95% CI 28-99%) and 100% (95% CI 78-100%) respectively (kappa 0.86). CONCLUSIONS In this pilot study, we identified DSCT as a potential unsophisticated approach for the early triage of CE sources among patients with AIS undergoing CTA upon admission.","Rodríguez-Granillo, Gaston A; Cirio, Juan J; Ciardi, Celina; Caballero, Maria Laura; Ceron, Marcos; Bleise, Carlos; Diluca, Pablo; Lylyk, Pedro",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,169,12

The secondary purpose was to analyze the factors affecting patient satisfaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical data for 124 patients who had undergone surgical extraction of mandibular third molar under IVS using MDZ were retrospectively investigated in this case-control study. The initial dose of MDZ was determined by body mass index (BMI) and weight. In the case of insufficient sedation at the beginning of surgery, additional doses were injected. During surgery, peripheral oxygen saturation, bispectral index score (BIS), heart rate, and blood pressure were monitored and recorded. The predictor variables were sex, age, BMI, sleeping time ratio, dental anxiety, Pederson scale, and initial dose of MDZ. The outcome variables were additional administration of MDZ, observer's assessment of alertness/sedation, intraoperative amnesia, and patient satisfaction. Descriptive statistics were computed, and the P-value was set at 0.05. RESULTS Most patients had an adequate level of sedation with only the initial dose of MDZ and were satisfied with the treatment under sedation; however, 19 patients needed additional administration, and 13 patients were unsatisfied. In multivariable logistic analysis, lower age (odds ratio [OR], 0.825; P=0.005) and higher dental anxiety (OR, 5.744; P=0.003) were related to additional administration; lower intraoperative amnesia (OR, 0.228; P=0.002) and higher BIS right before MDZ administration (OR, 1.379; P=0.029) had relevance to patient dissatisfaction. CONCLUSION The preoperative consideration of age and dental anxiety is necessary for appropriate dose determination of MDZ in the minor oral surgery under IVS. The amnesia about the procedure affects patient satisfaction positively.","Shin, Dong-Whan; Cho, Jin-Yong; Han, Yoon-Sic; Sim, Hye-Young; Kim, Hee-Sun; Jung, Da-Un; Lee, Ho",Journal of the Korean Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,169,10

Meanwhile, cephalosporin-resistant mosaic penA alleles have been reported worldwide. Therefore, it is urgent to monitor the expansion of cephalosporin-resistant mosaic penA alleles. OBJECTIVES To develop a comprehensive high-throughput method to efficiently screen AMR determinants. METHODS We developed a method based on multiplex PCR with MALDI-TOF MS, which can simultaneously screen for 24 mutations associated with multiple antimicrobial agents in 19 gonococcal AMR loci (NG-AMR-MS). The performance of the NG-AMR-MS method was assessed by testing 454 N. gonorrhoeae isolates with known MICs of six antibiotics, eight non-gonococcal Neisseria strains, 214 clinical samples and three plasmids with a confirmed mosaic penA allele. RESULTS The results show that NG-AMR-MS had a specificity of 100% with a sensitivity as low as 10 copies per reaction (except for PorB A121D/N/G, 100 copies per reaction). For clinical samples with gonococcal load >5 copies/μL, the method can accurately identify 20 AMR mutations. In addition, the method successfully detected specific cephalosporin-resistant strains with the A311V mutation in the penA allele. CONCLUSIONS Our high-throughput method can provide comprehensive AMR profiles within a multiplex format. Furthermore, the method can be directly applied to screening for AMR among clinical samples, serving as an effective tool for overall monitoring of N. gonorrhoeae AMR and also provides a powerful means to comprehensively improve the level of monitoring.","Li, Yamei; Xiu, Leshan; Liu, Jingwei; Zhang, Chi; Wang, Feng; Yin, Yueping; Peng, Junping",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,169,1

METHODS The available mRNA and miRNA microarray datasets were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database according to pre-determined screening criteria. Differentially expressed miRNA and mRNAs (DEmiRNAs and DEmRNAs) were extracted between NPC and noncancerous nasopharyngeal tissues. The target genes of DEmiRNAs were predicted with miRTarBase followed by the construction of DEmiRNAs-target DEmRNAs network, and functional analyses were performed. The DEmiRNAs expressions were validated and the performance of these DEmiRNAs was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) values. Finally, the correlations between DEmiRNAs and specific clinical factors were analyzed. RESULTS There were 1140 interaction pairs (including let-7d/f-MYC/HMGA2 and miR-452-ITGA9) in DEmiRNAs-target DEmRNAs network. The GO annotation analysis showed that several genes such as MYC, HMGA2 and ITGA9 primarily participated in cellular process. KEGG analysis showed that these targets were associated with cell cycle and cancer-related pathways. Down-regulated let-7(-d and -f) and up-regulated miR-452 were verified in datasets. The AUC values of these 3 DEmiRNAs (let-7d, let-7-f and miR-452) was 0.803, 0.835 and 0.735, respectively. Besides, miR-452 was significantly related to survival rate of NPC patients. CONCLUSION The findings implied let-7d/f-MYC/HMGA2 and miR-452-ITGA9 might be promising targets for the detection and treatment of NPC.","Liu, Lei; Wang, Hailing; Yan, Chaohui; Tao, Shudong",Technology in cancer research & treatment,169,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study at a free-standing, quaternary care pediatric hospital comparing first-degree, patient-HCW pairs identified by the hospital's COVID-19 contact tracing team (CTT) to those identified using EHR clinical event data (EHR Report). The primary outcome was the number of patient-HCW pairs detected by each process. RESULTS Among 233 patients with COVID-19, our EHR Report identified 4,116 patient-HCW pairs, including 2,365 (30.0%) of the 7,890 pairs detected by the CTT. The EHR Report also revealed 1,751 pairs not identified by the CTT. The highest number of patient-HCW pairs per patient was detected in the inpatient care venue.

It is thought a combination of adaptive alterations in immunity to allow for the fetal allograft combined with changes in anatomy and physiology accompanying pregnancy underlie these susceptibilities. Emerging infectious diseases are defined as those whose incidence in humans has increased in the past two decades or threaten to increase in the near future. The past decade alone has witnessed many such outbreaks, each with its own unique implications for pregnant women and their unborn fetuses as well as lessons for the health care community regarding response and mitigation. Examples of such outbreaks include, but are not limited to, severe acute respiratory syndrome, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, Ebola virus, and, most recently, the Zika virus. Although each emerging pathogen has unique features requiring specific considerations, there are many underlying principles that are shared in the recognition, communication, and mitigation of such infectious outbreaks. Some of these key principles include disease-specific delineation of transmission dynamics, understanding of pathogen-specific effects on both mothers and fetuses, and advance planning and contemporaneous management that prioritize communication among public health experts, clinicians, and patients. The productive and effective working collaboration among the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine has been a key partnership in the successful communication and management of such outbreaks for women's health care providers and patients alike. Going forward, the knowledge gained over the past decade will undoubtedly continue to inform future responses and will serve to optimize the education and care given to pregnant women in the face of current and future emerging infectious disease outbreaks.","Beigi, Richard H",Obstetrics and gynecology,169,1

The magnetostrictive interaction enables the coupling between a magnon mode (spin wave) and a mechanical mode in the ferrimagnet, and the magnon mode simultaneously couples to two microwave cavity fields via the magnetic dipole interaction. The magnon-phonon coupling is enhanced by directly driving the ferrimagnet with a strong red-detuned microwave field, and the driving photons are scattered onto two sidebands induced by the mechanical motion. We show that two cavity fields can be prepared in a stationary entangled state if they are, respectively, resonant with two mechanical sidebands. The present scheme illustrates a new mechanism for creating entangled states of optical fields and enables potential applications in quantum information science and quantum tasks that require entangled microwave fields.","Yu, Mei; Shen, Heng; Li, Jie",Physical review letters,169,11

It was found that SARS-CoV M(pro) exists in solution as an equilibrium of both monomeric and dimeric forms, and the dimeric form is the enzymatically active form. However, the mechanism of SARS-CoV M(pro) dimerization, especially the roles of its N-terminal seven residues (N-finger) and its unique C-terminal domain in the dimerization, remain unclear. Here we report that the SARS-CoV M(pro) C-terminal domain alone (residues 187 to 306; M(pro)-C) is produced in Escherichia coli in both monomeric and dimeric forms, and no exchange could be observed between them at room temperature. The M(pro)-C dimer has a novel dimerization interface. Meanwhile, the N-finger deletion mutant of SARS-CoV M(pro) also exists as both a stable monomer and a stable dimer, and the dimer is formed through the same C-terminal-domain interaction as that in the M(pro)-C dimer. However, no C-terminal domain-mediated dimerization form can be detected for wild-type SARS-CoV M(pro). Our study results help to clarify previously published controversial claims about the role of the N-finger in SARS-CoV M(pro) dimerization. Apparently, without the N-finger, SARS-CoV M(pro) can no longer retain the active dimer structure; instead, it can form a new type of dimer which is inactive. Therefore, the N-finger of SARS-CoV M(pro) is not only critical for its dimerization but also essential for the enzyme to form the enzymatically active dimer.","Zhong, Nan; Zhang, Shengnan; Zou, Peng; Chen, Jiaxuan; Kang, Xue; Li, Zhe; Liang, Chao; Jin, Changwen; Xia, Bin",Journal of virology,169,16

In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), HS is a key factor for pharmacoresistance, even though the mechanisms are not quite understood. While experimental TLE models are available, there is lack of models reflecting the natural HS development. Among domestic animals, cats may present with TLE-like seizures in natural and experimental settings. With this study on the prevalence, segmental pattern and clinicopathological correlates of feline HS, we evaluated the translational value for human research. Evaluation schemes for human brains were applied to epileptic cats. The loss of neurons was morphometrically assessed and the degree of gliosis was recorded. Hippocampal changes resembling human HS were seen in about one third of epileptic cats. Most of these were associated with infiltrative diseases such as limbic encephalitis. Irrespective of the etiology and semiology of seizures, total hippocampal sclerosis was the most prevalent form seen in epileptic animals. Other HS types also occur at varying frequencies. Segmental differences to human HS can be explained by species-specific synaptic connectivities and a different spectrum of etiologies. All these variables require consideration when translating results from feline studies regarding seizure-associated changes of the temporal lobe and especially HS.","Wagner, Eva; Rosati, Marco; Molin, Jessica; Foitzik, Ulrike; Wahle, Andrea M; Fischer, Andrea; Matiasek, Lara A; Reese, Sven; Flegel, Thomas; Matiasek, Kaspar",Brain pathology,169,27

The aim of this study was to assess how enlarging the JJS with a bidirectional linear stapling can aid in avoiding the risk of early SBO by kinking. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective cohort study concerns 1327 patients who underwent RYGB with CMD between May 2007 and August 2016. The first 626 patients (group A) had a unidirectional JJS. The following 701 patients (group B) had a bidirectional side-to-side JJS and a hand-sewn closure of the remaining defect. We compared early SBO between the two groups. RESULTS Eleven (1.75%) early SBO due to the JJS kinking occurred in group A, whereas none occurred in group B (p = 0.0012). Thirty-nine early postoperative complications happened in group A versus 32 in group B (p = 0.17). Nine (1.2%) digestive bleedings occurred in group B versus two (0.3%) in group A (OR = 4.05 [0.87-18], p = 0.054). Average operating time was 81 min [37-330] in group A and 77 min [33-240] in group B. CONCLUSION Enlarging the JJS with a bidirectional linear stapling is associated with a reduced risk of early SBO due to the anastomosis kinking. However, it could be related to an increased risk of digestive bleedings.","Munier, Pierre; Alratrout, Hefzi; Siciliano, Iole; Keller, Philippe",Obesity surgery,169,6

For almost two centuries, VACV was employed to provide cross-protection against variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, until the disease was eradicated in the late 1970s. Since that time, continued research on VACV has produced a number of modified vaccines with improved safety profiles. Attenuation has been achieved through several strategies, including sequential passage in an alternative host, deletion of specific genes or genetic engineering of viral genes encoding immunomodulatory proteins. Some highly attenuated third- and fourth-generation VACV vaccines are now being considered for stockpiling against a possible re-introduction of smallpox through bioterrorism. Researchers have also taken advantage of the ability of the VACV genome to accommodate additional genetic material to produce novel vaccines against a wide variety of infectious agents, including a recombinant VACV encoding the rabies virus glycoprotein that is administered orally to wild animals. This review provides an in-depth examination of these successive generations of VACV vaccines, focusing on how the understanding of poxviral replication and viral gene function permits the deliberate modification of VACV immunogenicity and virulence.","Jacobs, Bertram L; Langland, Jeffrey O; Kibler, Karen V; Denzler, Karen L; White, Stacy D; Holechek, Susan A; Wong, Shukmei; Huynh, Trung; Baskin, Carole R",Antiviral research,169,1

While people may take many preventive behaviours to minimize the risk, very little is known about the factors that can increase preventive behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined the effects of vulnerability, perceived risk, and fear on preventive behaviours of COVID-19. The study used a sample of 4,536 Turkish adults (M = 30.33 ± 10.95 years) recruited from 17 March through 1 April 2020. Vulnerability, perceived risk, fear, and preventive behaviours were measured with self-rating scales. Participants mostly engaged in avoidance of public transportation and frequent handwashing as preventive behaviours. Women had a significantly higher vulnerability to, perceived risk, and fear of new coronavirus compared to men. Correlation results indicated that age, gender, education level, vulnerability, perceived risk, and fear were related to preventive behaviours. Regression results demonstrated that vulnerability, perceived risk, and fear accounted for a significant amount of variance in preventive behaviours over and above the effects of demographic variables. The results suggest that vulnerability, perceived risk, and fear can significantly increase engagement in preventive behaviours during the novel coronavirus pandemic. The results have important implications for research and practice.","Yıldırım, Murat; Geçer, Ekmel; Akgül, Ömer","Psychology, health & medicine",169,16

Evolutionary psychology has advanced our understanding of why humans suffer psychological distress and mental illness. However, to date, the evolutionary origins of what drives humans to alleviate the suffering of others has received limited attention. Therefore, we draw upon evolutionary theory to assess why humans psychologically support one another, focusing on the interpersonal regulation of emotions that shapes how humans heal and console one another when in psychosocial distress. To understand why we engage in psychological healing, we review the evolution of cooperation among social species and the roles of emotional contagion, empathy, and self-regulation. We discuss key aspects of human biocultural evolution that have contributed to healing behaviors: symbolic logic including language, complex social networks, and the long period of childhood that necessitates identifying and responding to others in distress. However, both biological and cultural evolution also have led to social context when empathy and consoling are impeded. Ultimately, by understanding the evolutionary processes shaping why humans psychologically do or do not heal one another, we can improve our current approaches in global mental health and uncover new opportunities to improve the treatment of mental illness across cultures and context around the world.","Kohrt, Brandon A; Ottman, Katherine; Panter-Brick, Catherine; Konner, Melvin; Patel, Vikram",Clinical psychology review,169,8

METHODS The sample size was calculated at 100 patients based on similar measurements in the literature and divided into cohorts based on gender and side. These patients were consecutively collected from a population that had undergone CT angiography and did not have any vascular abnormality. The arterial diameter was measured at the proximal cavernous internal carotid artery (ICA), the ICA terminus, the middle cerebral artery (MCA) origin and an M2 origin. The length between these endpoints was calculated along the center line. The vessel taper was calculated for the ICA as the change in caliber per unit length. RESULTS The mean length of the ICA from the proximal cavernous segment to the ICA terminus was 33.1 ± 6.1 mm. The mean diameter at the cavernous ICA and the ICA terminus was 5 ± 0.6 mm and 3.6 ± 0.4 mm, respectively. The mean ICA taper was 0.04 ± 0.02 mm/1 mm. For the MCA, the diameter at the MCA and M2 origins measured 3.1 ± 0.4 mm and 2.4 ± 0.4 mm, respectively. The mean MCA length was 22.5 ± 8.1 mm. There was no significant difference based on gender or between right and left sides. Patients aged >60 years had longer ICAs (p=0.02), larger cavernous ICA (p=0.003), ICA terminus (p<0.0001) and MCA origin (p=0.01) diameters than those aged 40-60 years. The ICA vessel taper did not change with age. CONCLUSION ICA and MCA vessel size did not change based on gender or side. Older patients had more redundant vessels based on diameter and length. The ICA has a gentle taper from its proximal cavernous segment to the ICA terminus. This information can be important in planning interventions or designing endovascular devices.","Rai, Ansaar T; Hogg, Jeffery P; Cline, Brendan; Hobbs, Gerald",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,169,1

To this end, we knocked down α4 protein expression (α4 KD) using siRNA in cultured H9c2 cardiomyocytes and confirmed the lack of DNA damage/cell death by TUNEL staining and MTT assay. However, α4 KD did increase the phosphorylation of p53 and ATM/ATR substrates, decreased the expression of poly ADP-ribose polymerase and associated fragments. Expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was reduced, whereas expression of pro-apoptotic BAX protein did not change. Alpha4 KD reduced basal H2AX Ser139 phosphorylation, whereas adenoviral-mediated re-expression of α4 protein following α4 KD, restored basal H2AX phosphorylation at Ser139. The sensitivity of H9c2 cardiomyocytes to doxorubicin-induced DNA damage and cytotoxicity was augmented by α4 KD. Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of α4 protein in ARVM increased PP2AC expression and augmented H2AX Ser139 phosphorylation in response to doxorubicin. Furthermore, pressure overload-induced heart failure was associated with reduced α4 protein expression, increased ATM/ATR protein kinase activity, increased H2AX expression and Ser139 phosphorylation.

We conducted a policy implementation analysis to describe and evaluate the legal and regulatory actions taken at the autonomous community (AC) level after enactment of 2012 RDL and RD and their impact on access to general healthcare and HIV services among undocumented immigrants. METHODS We reviewed documents published by the governments of seven ACs (Andalucía, Aragón, Euskadi (Basque Country), Castilla-La Mancha, Galicia, Madrid, Valencia) from April 2012 to July 2018, describing circumstances under which undocumented immigrants would be able to access free healthcare services. We developed indicators according to the main systemic barriers presented in official documents to analyse access to free healthcare across the participating ACs. ACs were grouped under five access categories: high, medium-high, medium, medium-low and low. RESULTS Andalucía provided the highest access to free healthcare for undocumented immigrants in both general care and HIV treatment. Medium-high access was provided by Euskadi and medium access by Aragón, Madrid and Valencia. Castilla-La Mancha provided medium-low access. Galicia had low access. Only Madrid and Galicia provided different and higher level of access to undocumented migrants in HIV care compared with general healthcare. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of 2012 RDL and RD across the ACs varied significantly, in part due to the decentralisation of the Spanish healthcare system. The challenge of healthcare access among undocumented immigrants included persistent systemic restrictions, frequent and unclear rule changes, and the need to navigate differences across ACs of Spain.","Gogishvili, Megi; Costa, Sergio A; Flórez, Karen; Huang, Terry T",BMJ open,169,1

METHODS A prospective interventional study was designed. Ninety-one patients with a mean age of 71.65 ± 11.82 years were implanted with toric IOLs after phacoemulsification. Three monofocal toric IOLs (the Lentis LT [Oculentis, Berlin, Germany], enVista [Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY], and AcrySof IQ [Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX]) and one multifocal toric IOL (AcrySof IQ ReSTOR; Alcon Laboratories, Inc.) were implanted. Preoperative and postoperative images were taken to calculate the misalignment due to the marking method. To evaluate rotation in the different follow-up visits, another photograph was taken 1 hour and 1, 7 and 30 days postoperatively. Refraction, uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), and corrected distance visual acuity were measured 30 days postoperatively. RESULTS Postoperative UDVA was 0.1 logMAR or better in 64.6% of eyes implanted with monofocal IOLs and 46.4% of eyes implanted with multifocal IOLs. The enVista toric IOL showed the best UDVA compared to the other monofocal IOLs, with 81% of eyes with 0.1 logMAR or better. The mean misalignment in the total group studied was 0.07° ± 0.60°; 69.6% of monofocal IOLs and 67.9% of multifocal IOLs showed less than 5° of rotation. A correlation was found between postoperative UDVA and rotation in the monofocal and multifocal IOLs implanted (r = 0.439 [P < .011] and = 0.787 [P = .001], respectively). CONCLUSIONS At 1 month postoperatively, UDVA was slightly more affected by IOL rotation in multifocal than monofocal toric IOLs.

Participants completed usability tests in which their performance in assembling and administering doses of each pen was assessed against defined critical steps for ensuring safe and correct administration. RESULTS : Critical error rates among nurses were 4%, 40%, and 49% for Bemfola®, Ovaleap®, and Gonal-f®, respectively; and among patients were 7%, 16%, and 38%. The most frequently reported critical errors occurred with the multi-use pens and were incorrect/lack of priming and failure to check the dose window prior to setting a new dose. The need to 'top up' doses from a new pen or cartridge when a pen contained insufficient dose also caused errors. The single-use pens did not cause these errors. Overall, 63% of nurses and 67% of patients had most confidence in Bemfola® for correct dosing and self-administration.

The condition of approximately 23% of patients with DVST will worsen after initial presentation, as a result of restricted venous outflow and venous hypertension, but early identification of this subset is challenging. A venous collateral scale (VCS) that grades alternative drainage routes may improve prediction of clinical deterioration. OBJECTIVE To examine the ability of the VCS system to accurately identify patients with DVST who will experience clinical worsening, based on their imaging at presentation. METHODS From our institutional database, we identified patients with DVST on dedicated venous imaging between January 2010 and July 2016. A VCS was created and calculated from venous imaging at presentation by two reviewers blinded to subsequent data. RESULTS The 27 patients who met the inclusion criteria for this study had a median age of 42 years and 14 (52%) were female. Initial symptoms included headache without hemorrhage in 30% and focal deficit in 30%. Transverse sinus occlusion was present in 70% and superior sagittal sinus occlusion in 41%. VCS was 0 in 11%, 1 in 37%, and 2 in 52%. A lower VCS was significantly associated with clinical worsening both from time of initial symptom onset (77% vs 29%, VCS 0-1 vs 2, p<0.05) and during hospitalization (62% vs 0%, VCS 0-1 vs 2, p<0.01). In multivariate analysis, VCS but no other presenting features was significantly associated with in-hospital worsening (OR=2, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS The type and quality of venous collaterals influence outcome in DVST.

A logistic regression model was used to discriminate statistical variation and identify risk factors for anastomotic leakage. RESULTS A total of 1045 patients underwent elective colon cancer resection with primary anastomosis. Anastomotic leakage occurred in 6.4% of patients. Ileocolic anastomosis had an anastomotic leakage rate of 7.2%, colo-colonic/colorectal anastomosis 5.2% and ileorectal anastomosis 12.7%, with intersurgeon variability. The independent risk factors associated with anastomotic leakage were the use of perioperative blood transfusion (OR 2.83, CI 1.59-5.06, P < 0.0001) and the individual surgeon performing the procedure (OR up to 8.44, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION In addition to perioperative blood transfusion, the individual surgeon was identified as an important risk factor for anastomotic leakage. Efforts should be made to reduce performance variability amongst surgeons.","Marinello, F G; Baguena, G; Lucas, E; Frasson, M; Hervás, D; Flor-Lorente, B; Esclapez, P; Espí, A; García-Granero, E",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,169,1

Using a qualitative methodology, this study aims to explore why people in Germany and Switzerland were motivated to comply with policy measures during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and what factors hindered or limited their motivation. While quantitative surveys can measure the level of compliance, or broadly ask what motives people had for compliance, we here strive to explain why and how these motives lead to compliance. METHODS This publication has been made possible by the joint work of the members of the ""Solidarity in times of pandemics"" (SolPan) research commons. Seventy-seven semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with members of the general public in Germany (n = 46) and the German-speaking part of Switzerland (n = 31) in April 2020. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed following a grounded theory approach. RESULTS Three themes were identified that summarize factors contributing to compliant or noncompliant behavior. (1) Social cohesion was, on the one hand, an important motivator for compliance, but at the same time related to conflicting needs, illustrating the limits of compliance. (2) Consequences were considered on both the individual level (eg, consequences of individual infection) and societal level (eg, the societal and economic consequences of restrictions). (3) While for some participants following the rules was perceived as a matter of principle, others stressed the importance of making their own risk assessment, which was often associated with with a need for evidence on the effectiveness and reasons behind measures. CONCLUSION A variety of motives contribute to COVID-19 related compliance. Authorities should seek to address these multi-faceted aspects to support motivation for compliance in a large proportion of the population.","Zimmermann, Bettina M; Fiske, Amelia; McLennan, Stuart; Sierawska, Anna; Hangel, Nora; Buyx, Alena",International journal of health policy and management,169,1

DATA SOURCES Clinical data were derived from peer-reviewed primary literature and published guidelines from national or international medical organizations. Preprint manuscripts and popular media articles provided background information and illustrative examples. METHODS Included manuscripts were identified via searches using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, while organizational guidelines and popular media articles were identified using Google search queries. Practice guidelines were developed via consensus among all authors based on peer-reviewed manuscripts and national or international health care association guidelines. Strict objective criteria for inclusion were not used due to the rapidly changing environment surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and a paucity of rigorous empirical evidence. CONCLUSIONS In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical care must be judiciously allocated to treat the most severe conditions while minimizing the risk of long-term sequelae and ensuring patient, physician, and health care worker safety. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE The COVID-19 pandemic will have a profound short- and long-term impact on health care worldwide. Although the full repercussions of this disease have yet to be realized, the outlined recommendations will guide otolaryngologists in the treatment of pediatric patients in the face of an unprecedented global health crisis.","Bann, Darrin V; Patel, Vijay A; Saadi, Robert; Goyal, Neerav; Gniady, John P; McGinn, Johnathan D; Goldenberg, David; Isildak, Huseyin; May, Jason; Wilson, Meghan N",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,169,16

The following outcomes were analyzed: duration of hospitalization and of oxygen therapy, intensive care unit admission and need of mechanical ventilation. Results were adjusted for confounding factors (prematurity, age and breastfeeding). RESULTS A hundred and seventy six infants with bronchiolitis and/or pneumonia were included in the study. Their median age was 4.5 months. A hundred and twenty one had single RSV infection and 55 had coinfections (24 RSV + adenovirus, 16 RSV + human metapneumovirus and 15 other less frequent viral associations). The four severity outcomes under study were similar in the group with single RSV infection and in the coinfection groups, independently of what virus was associated with RSV. CONCLUSION Virus coinfections do not seem to affect the prognosis of hospitalized infants with acute RSV infection.","De Paulis, Milena; Gilio, Alfredo Elias; Ferraro, Alexandre Archanjo; Ferronato, Angela Esposito; do Sacramento, Patrícia Rossi; Botosso, Viviane Fongaro; Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal de; Marinheiro, Juliana Cristina; Hársi, Charlotte Marianna; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Vieira, Sandra Elisabete",Jornal de pediatria,169,12

MATERIAL AND METHODS In 24 German blackhead sheep, a surgically created gastroschisis was managed by fetoscopic placement of the extruded intestines into a bag. The bag was then fastened onto the fetal abdominal wall. Different materials (sterile gloves, latex condoms, laparosopic retrieval bags) and different fixation techniques (laparoscopic staplers, interrupted and continuous sutures) have been examined. The fetuses were retrieved and evaluated at the end of gestation. RESULTS Uterine bag insertion was successful in 15 of 24 (62.5%) and intestinal bag placement in 10 of 15 available fetuses (66.6%). The main factor limiting fetoscopic procedures was chorioamniotic separation (CAS). Sterilized condoms provided the most appropriate type of bags and the V-Loc™ running suture, the most expedient type of fixation, which was achieved in 9 of the 10 fetuses (complete = 2, partially = 7) by using a three port access (5 mm and 2 × 3 mm). All bags were encountered completely or partially dislocated from the fetus at the end of gestation. CONCLUSIONS Fetoscopic intestinal bag placement and fixation in gastroschisis technically demanding. None of the evaluated techniques led to permanent anchorage of the bag to the fetus. The development of specially designed instruments, bags and fixation methods is required to optimize this approach.","Bergholz, Robert; Krebs, Thomas; Cremieux, Birte; Georgi, Carla; Fromm, Felipe; Boettcher, Michael; Andreas, Thomas; Tiemann, Bastian; Wenke, Katharina; Reinshagen, Konrad; Hecher, Kurt",Surgical endoscopy,169,30

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess two decades of research on the efficacy of MBIs in reducing binge eating severity. METHODS We searched PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library for trials assessing the use of MBIs to treat binge eating severity in both clinical and non-clinical samples. The systematic review and meta-analysis was pre-registered at PROSPERO (CRD42020182395). RESULTS Twenty studies involving 21 samples (11 RCT and 10 uncontrolled samples) met inclusion criteria. Random effects meta-analyses on the 11 RCT samples (n = 618: MBIs n = 335, controls n = 283) showed that MBIs significantly reduced binge eating severity (g = -0.39, 95% CI -0.68, -0.11) at end of trial, but was not maintained at follow-up (g = -0.06, 95% CI, -0.31, 0.20, k = 5). No evidence of publication bias was detected. On the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2, trials were rarely rated at high risk of bias and drop-out rates did not differ between MBIs and control groups. MBIs also significantly reduced depression, and improved both emotion regulation and mindfulness ability. CONCLUSION MBIs reduce binge eating severity at the end of trials. Benefits were not maintained at follow-up; however, only five studies were assessed. Future well-powered trials should focus on assessing diversity better, including more men and people from ethnic minority backgrounds.","Grohmann, Dominique; Laws, Keith R",Journal of psychosomatic research,169,19

We reviewed the medical records and endoscopic images of 86 immunocompetent patients with CMV gastroenterocolitis. Immunocompetent patients were defined as those without congenital or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, use of anti-cancer chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressive agents, and inflammatory bowel diseases. The mean age was 65.5 ± 11.8 years and 53 (61.6%) were male. Sixty-eight (79.1%) patients had comorbidities. Upper gastrointestinal-dominant, small bowel-dominant, and colon-dominant types were observed in 19, 7, and 60 patients, respectively. Endoscopic features could be classified into discrete ulcerative type with/without exudate and diffuse erythematous type with/without exudate. Antiviral treatment with ganciclovir was initiated in 51 patients (59.3%), 40 of whom improved and 1 improved after changing ganciclovir to foscarnet. Thirty-three patients (38.4%) improved without antiviral treatment. Surgery was necessary in two patients because of colon perforation before antiviral treatment. Another two patients underwent surgery because of sigmoid stricture and cecal perforation during antiviral treatment. Endoscopic type was not associated with clinical outcomes, such as surgery and death.

Laparoscopic techniques to aid in the placement of the peritoneal portion have been reported previously. Laparoscopic shunt placement has been associated with decreased operating time, less blood loss, and shorter hospital stays. The authors describe a single-incision laparoscopic shunt (SILS) insertion technique that facilitates directed placement of the peritoneal portion of the catheter in children. A total of 6 pediatric patients underwent the SILS procedure between December 2008 and March 2009. This cohort included 5 girls and 1 boy; the average age was 6 years (range 1 day-16 years). One patient had previously undergone a VP shunt placement, but all other patients were undergoing the initial creation of their shunt. The most common pathological condition encountered was posttraumatic hydrocephalus (2 patients). All patients underwent successful placement of the peritoneal catheters. All catheters were seen to have CSF flowing freely within the peritoneal space. The authors' recent experience shows that SILS placement is safe and feasible in children. It allows accurate, directed placement of the VP shunt with a single, almost invisible, umbilical incision. The shunt tubing is remote from this incision.","Tormenti, Matthew J; Adamo, Matthew A; Prince, Jose M; Kane, Timothy D; Spinks, Theodore J",Journal of neurosurgery. Pediatrics,169,1

DESIGN This is a cross-sectional study. SETTING Participants responded to an on-line survey in June 2020. SUBJECTS The study included 3,183 residents within Quebec, Canada aged 18 and over. MEASURES Measures include perceived COVID-19 related discrimination, fear of COVID-19 infection, prior exposure to COVID-19, and prior social distancing behavior. Participants self-reported attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and perceived norms related to social distancing. Finally, we measured social distancing behavioral intention. ANALYSIS We evaluated a theory of planned behavior (TPB) measurement model of social distancing using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The association between COVID-19 perceived discrimination, fear of infection, previous social distancing behavior, exposure to COVID-19, TPB constructs and behavioral intentions to social distance were estimated using SEM path analysis. RESULTS TPB constructs were positively associated with intention to follow social distancing guidelines. Fear of COVID-19 infection and prior social distancing behavior were positively associated with behavioral intentions. In contrast, perceived discrimination was negatively associated with the outcome. Associations between fear of COVID-19, perceived COVID-19 discrimination and behavioral intentions were partially mediated by constructs of TPB. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 prevention efforts designed to emphasize positive attitudes, perceived control, and social norms around social distancing should carefully balance campaigns that heighten fear of infection along with anti- discrimination messaging.","Frounfelker, Rochelle L; Santavicca, Tara; Li, Zhi Yin; Miconi, Diana; Venkatesh, Vivek; Rousseau, Cecile",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,169,17

Initial studies have shown high safety with good efficacy at short term confirmed by trials conducted in United States (WEB-Intrasaccular Therapy) and in Europe (WEB Clinical Assessment of Intrasaccular Aneurysm Therapy [WEBCAST], French Observatory, and WEBCAST-2). OBJECTIVE To report the 2-yr clinical and anatomical results of WEB treatment in the combined population of 3 European trials. METHODS In a French Observatory, 2-yr clinical and anatomical data were collected. In WEBCAST and WEBCAST-2, 2-yr follow-up was optional, and data were collected when follow-up was performed. Aneurysm occlusion was evaluated using a 3-grade scale: complete occlusion, neck remnant, and aneurysm remnant. RESULTS The population for safety was 138/168 patients (82.1%), including 89 females (64.5%), with mean age of 55.5 ± 10.2 yr. The population for efficacy was 121/169 aneurysms (71.6%). Aneurysm locations were middle cerebral artery in 65/121 aneurysms (53.7%), anterior-communicating artery in 25/121 (20.7%), basilar artery in 17/121 (14.0%), and internal carotid artery terminus in 14/121 (11.6%). No clinically relevant adverse events occurred between years 1 and 2. At 2 yr, complete occlusion was observed in 62/121 (51.2%) aneurysms, neck remnant in 36/121 (29.8%) aneurysms, and aneurysm remnant in 23/121 (19.0%) aneurysms. The global retreatment rate at 2 yr was 9.3%. CONCLUSION This analysis confirms the high safety profile of WEB treatment at 2 yr. Aneurysm occlusion is generally stable at 2 yr, and the retreatment rate between 1 yr and 2 yr is low (2.0%).","Pierot, Laurent; Moret, Jacques; Barreau, Xavier; Szikora, Istvan; Herbreteau, Denis; Turjman, Francis; Holtmannspötter, Markus; Januel, Anne-Christine; Costalat, Vincent; Fiehler, Jens; Klisch, Joachim; Gauvrit, Jean-Yves; Weber, Werner; Desal, Hubert; Velasco, Stéphane; Liebig, Thomas; Stockx, Luc; Berkefeld, Joachim; Molyneux, Andrew; Byrne, James V; Spelle, Laurent",Neurosurgery,169,24

Commercial clothing embedded with textile electrodes has already been released onto the market, but there is insufficient information on the performance of textile SEMG electrodes because the required configuration may differ according to the electrode material. The current study analyzed the influence of electrode size and pattern reduction rate (PRR), and hence the clothing pressure (Pc) based on in vivo SEMG signal acquisition. Bipolar SEMG electrodes were made in different electrode diameters Ø 5-30 mm, and the clothing pressure ranged from 6.1 to 12.6 mmHg. The results supported the larger electrodes, and Pc showed better SEMG signal quality by showing lower baseline noise and a gradual increase in the signal to noise ratio (SNR). In particular, electrodes, Ø ≥ 20 mm, and Pc ≥ 10 mmHg showed comparable performance to Ag-Ag/Cl electrodes in current textile-based electrodes. The current study emphasizes and discusses design factors that are particularly required in the designing and manufacturing process of smart clothing with SEMG electrodes, especially as an aspect of clothing design.","Kim, Siyeon; Lee, Sojung; Jeong, Wonyoung",Polymers,169,1

We describe our simple method of laparoscopic, sutureless rectopexy, involving rectal mobilization (along with its peritoneum bilaterally) and fixation to the sacral promontory using a fixation device. We also present an analysis of short-term outcomes in patients treated using this procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 62 patients with CRP, who underwent a laparoscopic rectopexy via tack fixation, between 2004 and 2017. The peritoneum was widely attached near the site of peritoneal reflection, as in rectal cancer surgery. The hypogastric nerve was carefully detached from the front of the sacrum. Keeping the nerve intact, we lifted and mobilized the dissected rectum cranially towards the promontory, and the rectal peritoneum was affixed to the sacrum by applying 2 to 3 fixed tacks bilaterally, using a fixation device. RESULTS The median age of the study group was 80 (10 to 91) years. All procedures were successful without serious intraoperative complications; only 1 patient required conversion to open surgery. Median values for operative duration, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative period of hospitalization were 177 (125 to 441) minutes, 5 (0 to 275) mL, and 7 (3 to 17) days, respectively. Only 6 (9.7%) patients experienced recurrence during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic tacking rectopexy performed using a fixation device for repairing CRP is a simple, safe, and sutureless procedure with no severe complications or mortality.","Tomochika, Shinobu; Suzuki, Nobuaki; Yoshida, Shin; Fujii, Toshiyuki; Tokumitsu, Yukio; Shindo, Yoshitaro; Iida, Michihisa; Takeda, Shigeru; Hazama, Shoichi; Nagano, Hiroaki","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",169,16

Metabolic resistance to pyrethroid insecticides is conferred by the chimeric P450 enzyme CYP337B3, produced by unequal crossing-over between CYP337B1 and CYP337B2. CYP337B3 is 99.7% similar to CYP337B1 except for the 177 N-terminal amino acids containing the substrate recognition site 1 from CYP337B2. Here, we studied the structure-function relationship of CYP337B3 and CYP337B1 to determine the amino acids that enable CYP337B3 to efficiently hydroxylate the 4'-carbon position of fenvalerate, while neither CYP337B1 nor CYP337B2 can do so. RESULTS Site-directed mutagenesis showed the L114F substitution in CYP337B3 reduced its 4'-hydroxylation activity by 89%, but the reciprocal F114L substitution in CYP337B1 increased its 4'-hydroxylation activity to only 49% of the level of CYP337B3. Docking models showed that amino acid 114 seems to have different functions in CYP337B1 and CYP337B3. Antibodies detected 2 to 3-fold more CYP337B1 than CYP337B3 in larval cuticle, which along with a 49% 4'-hydroxylation activity increase due to a F114L substitution in vivo might be expected to provide as much protection of the larva against exposure to fenvalerate as CYP337B3. However, CYP337B3 is present at much higher frequencies than CYP337B1-CYP337B2 in most populations, including those recently invading South America. CONCLUSION The metabolic resistance to pyrethroids in H. armigera has evolved by saltational evolution; i.e. by a single mutation, an unequal crossing-over, producing a larger selective advantage than could be attained gradually by stepwise improvement of the parental enzyme.

Such symbiosis occurs only in a clade of angiosperms known as the nitrogen-fixing clade (NFC). It has long been proposed that root nodule symbiosis evolved several times (in parallel) in the NFC. Two recent phylogenomic studies compared the genomes of nodulating and related non-nodulating species across the four orders of the NFC and found that genes essential for nodule formation are lost or pseudogenized in the non-nodulating species. As these symbiosis genes are specifically involved in the symbiotic interaction, it means that the presence of pseudogenes and the loss of symbiosis genes strongly suggest that their ancestor, which still had functional genes, most likely had a symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. These findings agree with the hypothesis that nodulation evolved once at the common ancestor of the NFC, and challenge the hypothesis of parallel evolution. In this chapter, we will cover the current understandings on actinorhizal-type and legume nodule development, and discuss the evolution of the legume nodule type.","Shen, Defeng; Bisseling, Ton",Results and problems in cell differentiation,169,24

METHOD this is a methodological study of translation and cross-cultural adaptation. We used a sample of specialists (n = 3) and nursing students (n = 40). Socioeconomic and academic questionnaires were used for data collection, assessment and the translated instrument (SNSI-Brazil). RESULTS most students were female (90.0%), single (87.5%), unemployed (80.0%), they studied on average 11 hours per week, slept 6 hours per day; and rated the face and the content of the instrument as very good, agreeing substantially (kappa = 0.74 and p-value < 0.01). The judges showed regular agreement in their assessments, and the SNSI-Brazil showed a good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.80). CONCLUSION The SNSI-Brazil was validated for face and content, has a good internal consistency if compared to versions used in other countries.","Paula, Aline Beatriz Rocha; Gouveia, Marcia Teles de Oliveira; Lima, Francisca Fabiana Fernandes",Revista brasileira de enfermagem,169,1

We report a successful case of two-step laparoscopic surgery for synchronous double cancer of the colon and stomach accompanied by severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A 66-year-old man with COPD was diagnosed as having advanced colon cancer and early gastric cancer. On admission, he could not go upstairs (Grade III according to the Hugh-Jones classification) and his forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 600 mL (35.9%). The patient initially underwent laparoscopy-assisted sigmoidectomy with D3 lymphadenectomy, followed by laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy with D1 lymphadenectomy 68 days later. The patient's each postoperative course was uneventful with no pulmonary complications, and the patient was discharged 9 and 11 days after the first and second operations, respectively. The present case demonstrates that two-step laparoscopic surgery may be a safe and feasible surgical procedure for high-risk patients with synchronous intra-abdominal malignancies.","Yajima, Kazuhito; Kosugi, Shin-Ichi; Kano, Yosuke; Hanyu, Takaaki; Ichikawa, Hiroshi; Ishikawa, Takashi; Nogami, Hitoshi; Wakai, Toshifumi",Case reports in surgery,169,23

Recent studies have reported mortality rates ranging from 39-50% among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We report our experience ofmanagement and outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at a large tertiary-care center in Midwestern United States. Of 658 patients presenting to our tertiary care center, 217 needed hospitalization, majority (77%) of whom were severely sick requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). All received corticosteroids, and 78% of the patients received tocilizumab. More than two-thirds of the patients received anticoagulation and 80% of patients in the ICU had prone-positioning. The median duration of hospitalization was 12 days (interquartile range, 8 to16), median duration of intensive care unit stay was 7 days (interquartile range, 5 to 9) and requirement of mechanical ventilation was 6 days (interquartile range, 5 to 8) in our cohort.

Objective: To review immune changes brought along by each of these entities and how they might interrelate. Methods: We start presenting a brief review of the structure of the new coronavirus and how it alters the functioning of the human immune system. Subsequently, we describe the immune changes induced by AIT and how these changes could be favorable or unfavorable in the allergic patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a particular point of time during the evolving infection. Results: We describe how a healthy immune response against SARS-CoV-2 develops, versus an immune response that is initially suppressed by the virus, but ultimately overactivated, leading to an excessive production of cytokines (cytokine-storm-like). These changes are then linked to the clinical manifestations and outcomes of the patient. Reviewing the immune changes secondary to AIT, it becomes clear how AIT is capable of restoring a healthy innate immunity. Investigators have previously shown that the frequency of respiratory infections is reduced in allergic patients treated with AIT. On the other hand it also increases immunoregulation. Conclusion: As there are many variables involved, it is hard to predict how AIT could influence the allergic patient's reaction to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In any case, AIT is likely to be beneficial for the patient with allergic rhinitis and/or allergic asthma in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as controlling allergic diseases leads to a reduced need for contact with healthcare professionals. The authors remind the reader that everything in this article is still theoretical, since at the moment, there are no published clinical trials on the outcome of COVID-19 in allergic patients under AIT.","Larenas-Linnemann, Désirée E; Ortega-Martell, José A; Blandón-Vijil, María V; Rodríguez-Pérez, Noel; Luna-Pech, Jorge A; Estrada-Cardona, Alan; Arias-Cruz, Alfredo; Del Rio-Navarro, Blanca E; Rodríguez, Elsy M Navarrete; Pozo-Beltrán, Cesar F; Takane, Ernesto Onuma; Rojo-Gutiérrez, María I; Espinosa-Rosales, Francisco J; Martínez-Infante, Eric A",Allergy and asthma proceedings,169,24

Incisional hernias were created in Yucatan pigs and repaired after 3 weeks via open technique with suture-only primary closure or intraperitoneally placed porcine-derived acellular dermal matrix. Progressive changes in mechanical and biological properties of porcine-derived acellular dermal matrix and repair sites were assessed. Porcine-derived acellular dermal matrix-repaired hernias of additional animals were evaluated 2 and 4 weeks post incision to assess porcine-derived acellular dermal matrix regenerative potential and biomechanical changes. Hernias repaired with primary closure showed substantially more scarring and bone hyperplasia along the incision line. Mechanical remodeling of porcine-derived acellular dermal matrix was noted over time. Porcine-derived acellular dermal matrix elastic modulus and ultimate tensile stress were similar to fascia at 6 weeks. The biology of porcine-derived acellular dermal matrix-reinforced animals was more similar to native abdominal wall versus that with primary closure. In this study, porcine-derived acellular dermal matrix-reinforced repairs provided more complete wound healing response compared with primary closure.","Monteiro, Gary A; Delossantos, Aubrey I; Rodriguez, Neil L; Patel, Paarun; Franz, Michael G; Wagner, Christopher T",Journal of tissue engineering,169,1

Methods In this double-center retrospective study, we reviewed CT scans from patients who underwent RFA for primary or secondary lung tumors. Patients with partial ablation or tumor recurrence during the imaging follow-up were not included. The imaging features were assessed in pre-defined time points: immediate post-procedure, ≤4 weeks, 5-24 weeks, 25-52 weeks and ≥52 weeks. Late follow-up (3 and 5 years after procedure) was assessed clinically in 48 patients. Results The study population consisted of 69 patients and 144 pulmonary tumors. Six out of 69 (9%) patients had primary lung nodules (stage I) and 63/69 (91 %) had metastatic pulmonary nodules. In a patient-level analysis, immediately after lung RFA, the most common CT features were ground glass opacities (66/69, 96 %), consolidation (56/69, 81 %), and hyperdensity within the nodule (47/69, 68 %). Less than 4 weeks, ground glass opacities (including reversed halo sign) was demonstrated in 20/22 (91 %) patients, while consolidation and pleural thickening were detected in 17/22 patients (77 %). Cavitation, pneumatocele, pneumothorax and pleural effusions were less common features. From 5 weeks onwards, the most common imaging features were parenchymal bands. Conclusions Our study demonstrated the expected CT features after lung RFA, a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment for selected patients with primary and secondary lung tumors. Diagnostic and interventional radiologists should be familiar with the expected imaging features immediately after RFA and their change over time in order to avoid misinterpretation and inadequate treatments.","Araujo-Filho, Jose de Arimateia Batista; Menezes, Raonne Souza Almeida Alves; Horvat, Natally; Panizza, Pedro Sergio Brito; Bernardes, João Paulo Giacomini; Damasceno, Rodrigo Sanford; Oliveira, Brunna Clemente; Menezes, Marcos Roberto",European journal of radiology open,169,1

We evaluated the utility of high-resolution C-arm CT combined with streak metal artifact removal technology for stent-assisted embolization of intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS From October 2017 to July 2018, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University treated 107 patients with intracranial aneurysms (118 aneurysms in total) with stent-assisted embolization. Conventional C-arm CT and high-resolution C-arm CT scanning of the stented area were performed during and after treatment. 3D images were reconstructed with and without streak metal artifact removal techniques. Subsequently, the image quality was compared. The reconstructed images indicated the stent deployment degree and packing density. Follow-up assessments included clinical and angiographic outcomes and complications. RESULTS In total, 118 aneurysms were successfully embolized using 118 stents. Image quality was significantly higher (P < .05) with high-resolution C-arm CT combined with streak metal artifact removal reconstruction. Streak metal artifact removal reconstruction and 2D angiography at working angles showed incomplete deployment of 6 stents and incomplete aneurysm embolization of 15 patients, which were subsequently resolved. One case of hemorrhage was noted postoperatively. Follow-up of 93 patients at 6-13 months indicated 3 cases of aneurysm recurrence. CONCLUSIONS High-resolution C-arm CT combined with the streak metal artifact removal technique effectively reduced metal artifacts from stents and coils during aneurysm embolization. This method can help physicians determine the extent of stent deployment and the packing density of coils and thus potentially reduce complications and aneurysm recurrence.","Li, T-F; Ma, J; Han, X-W; Fu, P-J; Niu, R-N; Luo, W-Z; Ren, J-Z",AJNR.

The purpose of this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials is to investigate the effects of psychosocial interventions on depressive and anxiety symptoms, quality of life and self-efficacy in individuals with diabetes mellitus. Methods: The databases Pubmed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science and SocINDEX were searched with no year restriction. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials published in English that included individuals diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, aged 18 years or above, who engaged in a psychosocial intervention, with outcome measures addressing depressive or anxiety symptomology, quality of life or self-efficacy. Eligible studies needed to compare the intervention to usual care. Study selection was completed using Covidence and meta-analysis was undertaken using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Results: Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Five studies investigated the effects of psychosocial interventions and showed a medium to large benefit for depressive symptoms (SMD: -0.70; CI: -1.27, -0.13) which persisted at follow up (SMD: -1.54, CI: -2.97, -0.12). Similar results were not seen immediately post-intervention in the three studies that assessed anxiety symptoms (SMD: -0.30; CI: -0.69, 0.10); however, a medium beneficial effect was seen at follow up (SMD = -0.61, CI = -0.92 to -0.31). Small benefits were seen in the three studies assessing quality of life outcomes (SMD: 0.30, CI: 0.06, 0.55). No benefit was seen in the two studies assessing self-efficacy (SMD: 0.23, CI: -0.11, 0.57). Conclusions: The results of the current study provide preliminary evidence that psychosocial interventions, compared to usual care, reduce depressive symptoms, and may improve quality of life in individuals with diabetes.

Yet, causal empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis is scant. Here, we show that degrading the temporal continuity of visual experience during early postnatal life leads to a sizable reduction of the number of complex cells and to an impairment of their functional properties while fully sparing the development of simple cells. This causally implicates adaptation to the temporal structure of the visual input in the development of transformation tolerance but not of shape tuning, thus tightly constraining computational models of unsupervised cortical learning.","Matteucci, Giulio; Zoccolan, Davide",Science advances,169,33

The goal of the study was to identify water-quality impairments in order to set the priorities for post-hurricane relief and to guide future decisions on disaster preparation and relief administration. Field investigations were carried out on St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands as soon as the disaster area became accessible after the back-to-back hurricane strikes by Irma and Maria in 2017. Water samples were collected from individual household rain cisterns, the coastal ocean, and street-surface runoffs for microbial concentration. The microbial community structure and the occurrence of potential human pathogens were investigated in samples using next generation sequencing. Loop mediated isothermal amplification was employed to detect fecal indicator bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis. The results showed both fecal indicator bacteria and Legionella genetic markers were prevalent but were low in concentration in the water samples. Among the 22 cistern samples, 86% were positive for Legionella and 82% for Escherichia-Shigella. Enterococcus faecalis was detected in over 68% of the rain cisterns and in 60% of the coastal waters (n = 20). Microbial community composition in coastal water samples was significantly different from cistern water and runoff water. Although identification at bacterial genus level is not direct evidence of human pathogens, our results suggest cistern water quality needs more organized attention for protection of human health, and that preparation and prevention measures should be taken before natural disasters strike.","Jiang, Sunny C; Han, Muyue; Chandrasekaran, Srikiran; Fang, Yingcong; Kellogg, Christina A",Water research,169,14

We aimed to compare the efficacy of these techniques. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data for patients with recurrent aneurysms after initial endovascular treatment retreated in our center with either a pipeline embolization device (PED) or conventional coil embolization from January 2012 to July 2020. We performed 1:2 propensity score matching (PSM) using the nearest neighbor method. We controlled for: initial treatment strategy, aneurysm size, neck diameter, symptom presentation, history of aneurysm rupture, age, sex, fusiform-dissecting aneurysm, bifurcation aneurysm, and aneurysm location. The clinical and morphological factors of all patients at initial treatment and the angiographic and clinical results at the second treatment were collected and compared between the propensity-matched pairs. Results: A total of 105 intracranial aneurysms were identified; 18 patients (17.1%) were treated with a PED, and 87 (82.9%) were treated via conventional coil embolization. PSM resulted in 12 matched pairs (12 patients in the PED group and 24 in the coiling group). There was no significant difference of ischemic and hemorrhagic complications between the groups, the obliteration rate of branches covered by stent, or modified Rankin Scale scores at the last clinical follow-up. Importantly, the retreatment strategy in the PED group provided significantly different results vs. the coiling group (P < 0.001), with a lower recurrence rate (0.0 vs. 29.2%, respectively; P = 0.037). However, the procedural failure rate and the parent artery stenosis were more frequently in PED group compared with coiling group (both were 16.7 vs. 0.0%; P = 0.040). Conclusions: Endovascular retreatment for recurrent aneurysms after initial endovascular treatment might be safe and effective. Flow diverters might be associated with reduced risk of recanalization and an increased risk of procedural failure and mild parent artery stenosis.","Li, Wenqiang; Zhu, Wei; Sun, Xinguo; Liu, Jian; Wang, Yang; Wang, Kun; Zhang, Ying; Yang, Xinjian; Zhang, Yisen",Frontiers in neurology,169,1

Materials and Methods Forty-five patients belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status I and II undergoing eye enucleation or evisceration were randomly allocated to three equal groups (15 patients each). General anesthesia was used as the standardized technique in all patients. Group R received a single retrobulbar injection, Group K received intravenous ketamine infusion, and Group C received normal saline with the same rate of ketamine infusion. Intraoperative heart rate and mean arterial pressure, recovery time, postoperative pain score, time to first rescue analgesic, number of patients who required rescue analgesia, and any adverse events were reported. Results Postoperative pain Visual Analog Scale was significantly lower in R and K groups in comparison to the C group and was significantly higher in K than R group at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. In addition, the time to first rescue analgesic was significantly longer in R group (429 ± 54 min) than that in K group (272 ± 34 min), but compared to both groups, it was longer in C group (52 ± 7 min). In K group, the recovery time was longer with higher sedation score in comparison to the other two groups. Conclusions Single retrobulbar injection and low-dose ketamine infusion are safe and effective when used as adjuvants to general anesthesia, but retrobulbar block provides better control of postoperative pain with prolonged time to first rescue analgesic and reduced analgesic consumption.","Ali, Hassan Mohamed; Elbadawy, Ahmed Mohamed","Anesthesia, essays and researches",169,1

Technical success rate of CT/MR-CEUS FI was also recorded. RESULTS Technical efficacy was significantly higher in the FI group than in the US group (100% vs. 86.7%, P < 0.001). The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-year cumulative LTP rates in the FI group were significantly lower than in the US group (3.8%, 4.9%, 6.0%, 6.0%, 7.2%, and 7.2% vs. 16.9%, 20.1%, 25%, 25%, 25%, and 25%, respectively; P < 0.001); RFS and OS were significantly higher in the FI group than in the US group (P = 0.027 and P = 0.049, respectively). The technical success rate of FI was 85.3%. CONCLUSIONS Intraprocedural CT/MR-CEUS FI improved the treatment effect of thermal ablation of HCC by immediately assessing treatment response and guiding supplementary ablation relative to those resulting from the use of conventional US.","Ma, Qiu-Ping; Xu, Er-Jiao; Zeng, Qing-Jing; Su, Zhong-Zhen; Tan, Lei; Chen, Jia-Xin; Zheng, Rong-Qin; Li, Kai",Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,169,1

Dentistry is no exception to this trend, and the applications of artificial intelligence are particularly promising in the field of oral and maxillofacial (OMF) radiology. Recent researches on artificial intelligence in OMF radiology have mainly used convolutional neural networks, which can perform image classification, detection, segmentation, registration, generation, and refinement. Artificial intelligence systems in this field have been developed for the purposes of radiographic diagnosis, image analysis, forensic dentistry, and image quality improvement. Tremendous amounts of data are needed to achieve good results, and involvement of OMF radiologist is essential for making accurate and consistent data sets, which is a time-consuming task. In order to widely use artificial intelligence in actual clinical practice in the future, there are lots of problems to be solved, such as building up a huge amount of fine-labeled open data set, understanding of the judgment criteria of artificial intelligence, and DICOM hacking threats using artificial intelligence. If solutions to these problems are presented with the development of artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence will develop further in the future and is expected to play an important role in the development of automatic diagnosis systems, the establishment of treatment plans, and the fabrication of treatment tools. OMF radiologists, as professionals who thoroughly understand the characteristics of radiographic images, will play a very important role in the development of artificial intelligence applications in this field.","Heo, Min-Suk; Kim, Jo-Eun; Hwang, Jae-Joon; Han, Sang-Sun; Kim, Jin-Soo; Yi, Won-Jin; Park, In-Woo",Dento maxillo facial radiology,169,16

A few authors have investigated scores based on the ultrasonographic interstitial syndrome for this purpose, but none have compared them with the gold standard computed tomography in children. METHODS Children < 10 kilograms undergoing a chest computed tomography for clinical purposes at a tertiary hospital Pediatric Intensive Care Unit were enrolled in the study. An ultrasound scan was performed shortly after computed tomography. Each hemithorax was divided in 6 zones, and each zone was scored: 1 = no B lines; 2 = < 3 B lines; 3 > 3 well separated B lines; 4 = crowded, coalescent B lines; 5 = white lung; 6 = consolidation. The pediatric Lung Ultrasound Score was obtained by adding all zones. Interobserver variation for two separate operators was calculated. RESULTS Ten children, median age 95 days (range 23 - 721), were enrolled. Mean pediatric Lung Ultrasound Score had a significant correlation with lung density (ρ = 0.68) and percentage of hypoaerated lung (ρ = 0.51). Median density and percentage of hypoaerated lung increased along the ultrasound patterns values (p < 0.05) although not all patterns were significantly different from adjacent ones in the pairwise comparison. Interobserver variability in scoring of ultrasonographic patterns was moderate. CONCLUSIONS The pediatric Lung Ultrasound Score correlates with lung density and percentage of hypoaerated lung measured with computed tomography.","Fochi, Oliviero; Bronco, Alfio; Nacoti, Mirco; Signori, Davide; Gatti, Stefano; Sala, Francesco; Rozen, Thomas; Bonanomi, Ezio; Bellani, Giacomo",Minerva anestesiologica,169,1

In addition to fever and respiratory symptoms, digestive symptoms also are observed in some patients with COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was reported to be the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to comprehensively investigate the digestive symptoms that occur in COVID-19 patients, and the potential pathogenic route of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in digestive tract organs (from the oral cavity to the gastrointestinal tract). We investigated the digestive symptoms of 48 patients with COVID-19 and explored ACE2 expression in digestive tract and lung cancers, based on a series of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data obtained from public databases. We found that 25% (12/48) of the patients with COVID-19 suffered from digestive symptoms, among which pharyngalgia (7/48) was the most common manifestation, followed by diarrhea (3/48), anorexia (3/48), and nausea (1/48). The bulk tissue RNA sequencing analysis indicated that digestive tract organs had higher ACE2 expression levels compared to the lung, and the expression of ACE2 in the lung increased with age. Single-cell RNA-Seq results showed that the ACE2-positive-cell ratio in digestive tract organs was significantly higher compared to the lung. ACE2 expression was higher in tumor cells compared to normal control (NC) tissues. While in gastric tissues, ACE2 expression gradually increased from chronic gastritis to metaplasia, to early cancer. Our data might provide a theoretical basis for screening the SARS-CoV-2 susceptible population and for the clinical classification of treatment of patients with COVID-19.","Xu, Jiabin; Chu, Mei; Zhong, Fan; Tan, Xinghua; Tang, Guofang; Mai, Jianbo; Lai, Niangmei; Guan, Chenyu; Liang, Yujie; Liao, Guiqing",Cell death discovery,169,24

While employment is an important element of reentry plans, low-wage jobs may not necessarily help women leave illicit activities, including commercial sex work. Incarcerated women often move between care/service work and sex work to supplement income, putting them at greater risk for negative health outcomes. RESULTS Using survey data from 400 women detained in a large urban jail, we examined how incarcerated women's experience with sex work and low-wage care/service work affects four health-related outcomes: overall health concerns, clinical depression, regular drug use, and self-esteem. Of the survey participants, 24% engaged exclusively in sex work and 34% in care/service work. However, 41% of women held both sex work and care/service work jobs, prior to incarceration. Compared to women engaged in care/service work, a greater proportion of women engaged in sex work reported overall health concerns, clinical depression, and regular drug use. On the other hand, women in care/service work jobs exclusively reported lower levels of self-esteem than women engaging in sex work. CONCLUSIONS Many reentry programs emphasize the importance of employment for former inmates, and yet, job options for women detained in jail are often limited to low-wage care/service jobs, which do not necessarily provide adequate security to lift women's economic burdens. Consequently, many women with a history of incarceration may supplement their income with sex work to meet their basic economic needs. However, both of these highly gendered and devalued jobs may negatively affect health and wellbeing of women.","Kim, Sage J; Peterson, Caryn",Health & justice,169,12

However, myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI) can offset the benefit of reperfusion therapy and worsen the outcome. In both ischemia and reperfusion, autophagy remains problematic. Activating molecule in Beclin1-regulated autophagy (Ambra1) is an important protein in autophagy regulation, and its function in MIRI remains unclear. Thus, we used H9C2 cells to investigate the function of Ambra1 in MIRI and the underlying mechanisms involved. Hypoxia and reoxygenation of H9C2 cells were used to mimic MIRI in vitro. During hypoxia, autophagy flux was blocked, then recovered in reoxygenation. Ambra1 overexpression increased autophagy in the H9C2 cells, as the LC3B II/I ratio increased, and alleviated cellular necrosis and apoptosis during hypoxia and reoxygenation. This effect was counteracted by an autophagy inhibitor. Knocking down Ambra1 can block autophagy which P62 sediment/supernatant ratio increased while the ratio of LC3B II/I decreased, and worsen outcomes. Ambra1 enhances autophagy in H9C2 cells by improving the stability and activity of the ULK1 complex. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are an important cause of MIRI. ROS were reduced when Ambra1 was overexpressed and increased when Ambra1 was knocked down, indicating that Ambra1 can protect against hypoxia and reoxygenation injury in H9C2 cells by promoting autophagy and reducing ROS.","Zhao, Lin; Cheng, Liting; Wu, Yongquan",BioMed research international,169,31

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of CMD in adolescents, from the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Only studies composed by adolescents (10 to 19 years old) that evaluated the CMD prevalence according to the GHQ-12 were considered. The studies were searched in Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Lilacs, Adolec, Google Scholar, PsycINFO and Proquest. In addition, the reference lists of relevant reports were screened to identify potentially eligible articles. Studies were selected by independent reviewers, who also extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were performed to summarize the prevalence of CMD and estimate heterogeneity across studies. A total of 43 studies were included. Among studies that adopted the cut-off point of 3, the prevalence of CMD was 31.0% (CI 95% 28.0-34.0; I2 = 97.5%) and was more prevalent among girls. In studies that used the cut-off point of 4, the prevalence of CMD was 25.0% (CI 95% 19.0-32.0; I2 = 99.8%). Global prevalence of CMD in adolescents was 25.0% and 31.0%, using the GHQ cut-off point of 4 and 3, respectively. These results point to the need to include mental health as an important component of health in adolescence and to the need to include CMD screening as a first step in the prevention and control of mental disorders.","Silva, Sara Araújo; Silva, Simoni Urbano; Ronca, Débora Barbosa; Gonçalves, Vivian Siqueira Santos; Dutra, Eliane Said; Carvalho, Kênia Mara Baiocchi",PloS one,169,7

METHODS A convenience sample of 17 anesthesia residents and fellows with at least 3 years of anesthesia training was recruited from teaching hospitals in Toronto for a randomized crossover trial. Each participant passed each DLT over an AEC in an airway simulator, visualized and video recorded via a video laryngoscope (GlideScope). The order of exchange was randomized by blindly pulling the name of the manufacturer of a DLT from a box. The primary outcome was time to intubate, defined as time from the bronchial lumen entering the GlideScope view to the bronchial lumen passing the vocal cords. Also recorded were participants' subjective rating of the ease of use and failure rate, defined as an attempt >150-second duration. RESULTS Time to intubate was faster with the Fuji-Phycon DLT (median 2 seconds) compared with both the Rusch (median 27 seconds, P = 0.0144) and Mallinckrodt (median 21 seconds, P = 0.0117). On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being very easy to use and 1 being very difficult, the Fuji-Phycon was judged to be easier to use (median 10 seconds) compared with the Rusch (median 3, P = 0.0186) and the Mallinckrodt (median 4 seconds, P = 0.0123). The Rusch was associated with significantly more failures than the other DLTs, P = 0.002. CONCLUSIONS The Fuji-Phycon DLT was easier to pass over an AEC in this simulator trial and warrants consideration in patients with difficult airways who require 1-lung ventilation.","Gamez, Ryan; Slinger, Peter",Anesthesia and analgesia,169,0

DC-SIGNR, a C-type lectin encoded by CLEC4M, is a receptor for the virus. A variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in its neck region was recently associated with susceptibility to SARS infection. However, this association was controversial and was not supported by subsequent studies. Two explanations may account for this discrepancy: (1) there may be an unknown predisposition polymorphism located in the proximity which is linked to the VNTR; or (2) it was a spurious association due to unrecognised population structure in the VNTR. METHODS We performed a comprehensively genetic association study on this C-type lectin gene cluster (FCER2, CLEC4G, CD209, and CLEC4M) at 19p13.3 by a tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) approach. RESULTS 23 tagSNPs were genotyped in 181 SARS patients and 172 population controls. No significant association with disease predisposition was detected. Genetic variations in this cluster also did not predict disease prognosis. However, we detected a population stratification of the VNTR alleles in a sample of 1145 Han Chinese collected from different parts of China. CONCLUSION The results indicated that the genetic predisposition allele was not found in this lectin gene cluster and population stratification might cause the previous positive association.","Li, H; Tang, N L-S; Chan, P K-S; Wang, C-Y; Hui, D S-C; Luk, C; Kwok, R; Huang, W; Sung, J J-Y; Kong, Q-P; Zhang, Y-P",Journal of medical genetics,169,1

One complexity that warrants consideration is the male-specific impacts of the pandemic within adolescence. METHODS A review of the relevant literature. RESULTS Matters of social distancing, virtual education, and substance use may impact adolescent men in fashions that raise their suicide risk more significantly relative to adolescent women. Social distancing may impact adolescents' friendships and generate a regression back to the nuclear family; qualities of male adolescents' friendships and of masculinity suggest that these impacts may be more severe in adolescent men and may directly raise suicide risk. Virtual schooling yields educational and social setbacks; losses of team sports, male mentors, and the implications of diminished educational advancement may more adversely affect adolescent men and raise risk. Substance use has increased in the pandemic, particularly among adolescent men. There are direct associations with suicide risk as well as indirectly through increased parental conflict and punishment. CONCLUSION As adolescent men die by suicide at significantly elevated rates relative to adolescent women, a male-specific consideration of these impacts is indicated to address adolescent suicide in our current era. Recommendations are made for integrating these considerations into updated adolescent suicide risk assessment and prevention efforts.","Rice, Timothy; Sher, Leo",Acta neuropsychiatrica,169,16

As studies of the immunotoxicity of FSD are lacking, the effects of whole-body inhalation (6 h/d for 4 d) of a FSD, i.e., FSD 8, was investigated at 1, 7, and 27 d post-exposure in rats. Exposure to 10 mg/m3 FSD 8 resulted in decreased lung-associated lymph node (LLN) cellularity, total B-cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells and total natural killer (NK) cells at 7-d post exposure. The frequency of CD4+ T-cells decreased while the frequency of B-cells increased (7 and 27 d) in the LLN. In contrast, increases in LLN cellularity and increases in total CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were observed in rats following 30 mg/m3 FSD 8 at 1 d post-exposure.

Patients infected with COVID-19 may present with a series of conditions. A considerable number of patients express taste and smell disturbances as a prodromal, coexistent, or as the only manifestation of COVID-19 infection. The objective of the present review is to review the hypothetical mechanisms of action and etiopathogenesis of dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Multiple scientific databases were explored, including PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Cochrane-library, LILACS, Livivo and OpenGrey. All types of articles that discussed the pathogenesis of dysgeusia were included, while articles that described dysgeusia without detail about its mode of action were excluded. RESULTS A total of 47 articles, with different designs, were included in this review. These articles suggested direct viral neural invasion to olfactory and gustatory nerves, viral cytotoxicity to taste buds, angiotensin II imbalance, augmented pro-inflammatory cytokines, and disturbances in salivary glands and sialic acid. COVID-19 induced-dysgeusia was also associated with systemic diseases, medications, zinc, chemicals, and disinfectants. CONCLUSIONS The most likely cause of transient dysgeusia in COVID-19 is peripheral neurotropism and direct toxicity to taste buds or olfactory epithelium. Other factors may also play a contributory role in dysgeusia, such as a defect in the quality and quantity of saliva, pro-inflammatory cytokines, angiotensin II accumulation, systemic diseases, hypozincemia, and excessive use of chemicals.","Mahmoud, M M; Abuohashish, H M; Khairy, D A; Bugshan, A S; Khan, A M; Moothedath, M M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,169,12

Automated variable selection allows data-driven risk evaluation by recognizing distinct patterns in data. We sought to evaluate an automated variable selection method (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, LASSO) for predicting 30-day mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction and CS (AMICS) receiving acute percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to two established scores. METHODS AND RESULTS Consecutive patients with AMICS receiving acute PCI at one of two tertiary heart centres in Denmark 2010-2017. Patients were divided according to treatment with mechanical circulatory support (MCS); PCI-MCS cohort (n = 220) versus PCI cohort (n = 1180). The latter was divided into a development (2010-2014) and a temporal validation cohort (2015-2017). Cohort-specific LASSO models were based on data obtained before PCI. LASSO models outperformed IABP-SHOCK II and CardShock risk scores in discriminative ability for 30-day mortality in the PCI validation [receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (ROC AUC) 0.80 (95% CI 0.76-0.84) vs 0.73 (95% CI 0.69-0.77) and 0.70 (95% CI 0.65-0.75), respectively, P < 0.01 for both] and PCI-MCS development cohort [ROC AUC 0.77 (95% CI 0.70-0.83) vs 0.64 (95% CI 0.57-0.71) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.57-0.71), respectively, P < 0.01 for both]. Variable influence differed depending on MCS, with age being the most influential factor in the LASSO-PCI model, whereas haematocrit and estimated glomerular filtration rate were the highest-ranking factors in the LASSO-PCI-MCS model. CONCLUSION Data-driven prognosis models outperformed established risk scores in patients with AMICS receiving acute PCI and exhibited good discriminative abilities. Observations indicate a potential use of machinelearning to facilitate individualized patient care and targeted interventions in the future.","Helgestad, Ole K L; Povlsen, Amalie L; Josiassen, Jakob; Möller, Sören; Hassager, Christian; Jensen, Lisette O; Holmvang, Lene; Schmidt, Henrik; Møller, Jacob E; Ravn, Hanne B",European heart journal.

Restoration of restriction is commonly the first procedure, but not all may benefit from it. We hence want to illustrate the decision-making process by presenting a patient with the background of initial Rouxen-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and redo-RYGB, who then underwent a further revision by a 2-stage approach due to weight regain. The first stage involved shortening of the common channel and the second one reconstruction of his gastric pouch with duodenal switch (DS). Consequently we wish to focus here on a discussion about operative techniques and strategies to improve outcomes in such patients.","Karcz, Wojciech K; Zhou, Cheng; Braun, William; Małczak, Piotr; Wellner, Ulrich",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,169,5

COVID-19 has become a global public health emergency because of its high virulence and mortality capacity. This patent review aims to provide an overview of the patents that present possible treatments for SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV.Areas covered: To treat SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2, researchers have filed patents for a number of therapeutic agents. Most of the treatments found were protease inhibitors aimed at proteases such as PLpro, 3CLpro, RNA helicase, and Spike protein, or used monoclonal antibodies and interferons. In addition, the use of Chinese folk medicine and its multitude of medicinal plants with strong antiviral properties was reinforced. Thus, these therapies used in previous epidemics can serve as an aid in the new pandemic by SARS-CoV-2 and be a starting point for new treatments.Expert opinion: The various antiviral alternatives presented in this review offer therapeutic options to fight coronavirus infections. If shown to be effective, these drugs may be extremely important in the current pandemic.","Nascimento Junior, José Adão Carvalho; Santos, Anamaria Mendonça; Quintans-Júnior, Lucindo José; Walker, Cristiani Isabel Banderó; Borges, Lysandro Pinto; Serafini, Mairim Russo",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,169,7

This study aimed to assess changes in diet patterns among youths in China under the COVID-19 lockdown, based on the COVID-19 Impact on Lifestyle Change Survey (COINLICS), a national retrospective survey distributed via social media platforms during 9-12 May 2020 where 10,082 youth participants in China have voluntarily reported their basic sociodemographic information and routine diet patterns in the months before and after COVID-19 lockdown. We used paired t-tests or χ2 tests to evaluate the significance of differences in consumption patterns of 12 major food groups and beverages across educational levels, between sexes, and before and after COVID-19 lockdown. During the COVID-19 lockdown, significant decreases were observed in the frequency of intake of rice, meat, poultry, fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, soybean products, and dairy products, with significant sex differences (females eating more rice, fresh vegetables and fruit and less meat, poultry, soybean and dairy products than males). Significant increases were observed in the frequency of consumption of wheat products, other staple foods, and preserved vegetables, with males consuming these foods more frequently than females. Graduate students consumed most foods more frequently except rice and other staple foods and preserved vegetables. The frequency of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption had decreased while frequency of tea drinking had increased. The participating youths' diet patterns had significantly changed during the COVID-19 lockdown, with heterogeneities observed to different extents between sexes and across educational levels. Our findings would inform policy-makers and health professionals of these changes in time for better policy making and public health practice.","Jia, Peng; Liu, Liang; Xie, Xiaofen; Yuan, Changzheng; Chen, Hui; Guo, Bing; Zhou, Junmin; Yang, Shujuan",Appetite,169,26

This study aims to describe the dynamic trends in COVID-19 blood cell parameters and inflammatory factors. Methods Ninety-two patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Jingzhou Central Hospital, Hubei Province, China, between January 23, 2020, and April 10, 2020, were enrolled. Epidemiological data, clinical information, and laboratory test results were collected and analyzed. Results As patient age increased, disease severity increased (P<0.0001). The inflammatory factor C-reactive protein (CRP) showed a gradual increasing trend with disease aggravation. Based on dynamic change graphs, CRP in all patients with severe and critical COVID-19 initially increased and then decreased; however, CRP in patients with a good prognosis did not increase again after the initial decline (<20 mg/L). CRP in patients with a poor prognosis returned to a high level (>50 mg/L) 1 week after the initial decrease and continued to fluctuate at a high level. Lymphocyte count (LYM#) in patients with severe and critical disease was significantly lower (<1×109/L) than that in patients with moderate disease; LYM# was significantly increased 3 weeks after disease onset in patients with a good prognosis (>1×109/L), but patients with a poor prognosis continued to have a low LYM#. Conclusions CRP and LYM# showed strong correlation with disease progression, suggesting that these parameters could be used to monitor changes in patient condition.","Deng, Rongrong; Wang, Changzheng; Ye, Yi; Gou, Liyao; Fu, Zhongxiao; Ye, Bo; Shao, Feng; Zhang, Xiaomei; Fu, Weiyang; Xiao, Jianping; Li, Tao; Qi, Huan; Li, Chengbin",Annals of translational medicine,169,16

DESIGN A cross-sectional study using the baseline dataset from the Japan Molecular Epidemiology for Lung Cancer Study. SETTING Forty-three medical institutions nationwide in Japan. PARTICIPANTS From July 2012 to December 2013, 957 patients with newly diagnosed stage I-IIIB NSCLC who underwent surgery were enrolled, and molecular analyses were performed on 876 samples (from 441 ever-smokers and 435 never-smokers). MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURED We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values using logistic regression to compare between the predictive values of smoking duration and pack-years for mutational frequencies in the v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS), tumour suppressor p53 (TP53), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) genes and for cytosine-to-adenine base substitution (C>A). RESULTS For predicting KRAS mutations, the AUC values for smoking duration and pack-years were 0.746 (95% CI 0.682 to 0.800) and 0.759 (95% CI 0.700 to 0.810), respectively (p=0.058). For predicting KRAS mutations in smokers, the AUC values for smoking duration and pack-years were 0.772 (95% CI 0.697 to 0.833) and 0.787 (95% CI 0.714 to 0.845), respectively (p=0.036). There were no significant differences between the AUC values for smoking duration and pack-years in terms of predicting TP53 and EGFR mutations and C>A. Pack-years was a significantly better predictor of KRAS mutations than smoking duration. CONCLUSION Smoking duration was not significantly different from pack-years in predicting the likelihood of smoking-related gene mutations. Given the recall bias in obtaining smoking information, smoking duration alone should be considered for further investigation as a simpler alternative to pack-years.","Ogawa, Koichi; Koh, Yasuhiro; Kaneda, Hiroyasu; Izumi, Motohiro; Matsumoto, Yoshiya; Sawa, Kenji; Fukui, Mitsuru; Taniguchi, Yoshihiko; Yoshimoto, Naoki; Tamiya, Akihiro; Ando, Masahiko; Kubo, Akihito; Isa, Shun-Ichi; Saka, Hideo; Matsumura, Akihide; Kawaguchi, Tomoya",BMJ open,169,8

METHODS A retrospective cohort was drawn from the electronic health records of two academic medical centers and four community hospitals between February 15 and May 24, 2020. Associations between history of mood disorder and in-hospital mortality and hospital discharge home were examined using regression models among any hospitalized patients with positive tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS Among 2,988 admitted individuals, 717 (24.0%) had a prior mood disorder diagnosis. In Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, and hospital site, presence of a mood disorder prior to admission was associated with greater in-hospital mortality risk beyond hospital day 12 (crude hazard ratio=2.156, 95% CI=1.540, 3.020; fully adjusted hazard ratio=1.540, 95% CI=1.054, 2.250). A mood disorder diagnosis was also associated with greater likelihood of discharge to a skilled nursing facility or other rehabilitation facility rather than home (crude odds ratio=2.035, 95% CI=1.661, 2.493; fully adjusted odds ratio=1.504, 95% CI=1.132, 1.999). CONCLUSIONS Hospitalized individuals with a history of mood disorder may be at risk for greater COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and are at increased risk of need for postacute care. Further studies should investigate the mechanism by which these disorders may confer elevated risk.","Castro, Victor M; Gunning, Faith M; McCoy, Thomas H; Perlis, Roy H",The American journal of psychiatry,169,31

In native habitats, long-term strategies allow to survive severe stress but are of limited use in large bioreactors where micro environmental conditions may change right after said programs are started. Related on/off switching of genes causes additional ATP burden that may reduce the cellular capacity for producing the desired product. Here, we present an agent based data driven model linked to computational fluid dynamics takorsfinally allowing to predict additional ATP needs of E. coli K12 W3110 exposed to realistic large-scale bioreactor conditions. The complex model describes transcriptional up- and downregulation dynamics of about 600 genes starting from subminute range covering 28h. The data-based approach was extracted from comprehensive scale-down experiments. Simulating mixing and mass transfer conditions in a 54 m³ stirred bioreactor, 120,000 E. coli cells were tracked while fluctuating between different zones of glucose availability. It was found that cellular ATP demands rise between 30 - 45% of growth decoupled maintenance needs which may limit the production of ATP-intensive product formation accordingly. Furthermore, spatial analysis of individual cell transcriptional patterns reveal very heterogeneous gene amplifications with hot spots of 50-80% mRNA upregulation in the upper region of the bioreactor. The phenomenon reflects the time-delayed regulatory response of the cells that propagates through the stirred tank. After 4.2 h cells adapt to environmental changes but still have to bear additional 6% ATP-demand. This article is protected by copyright.

However, these machines cannot precisely simulate a live pitcher's pitching motion. To understand if a batter's movement strategy would be altered due to disparate visual information provided by a pitching machine as opposed to a live pitcher, the present study aimed to compare differences in baseball batting movement patterns under the two delivery conditions. Methods: To examine movement variations and different strategies of each high-level athlete rather than obtaining averaged group performance, single-subject analysis was adopted. Four professional baseball players were recruited to bat around 50 pitches under each delivery condition. Vertical ground reaction forces of the participants' batting movements were recorded. Relative timings of key events and values of several kinetic parameters during batting were examined. Results: When batting against the pitching machine, batters initiated forward stepping earlier (relative to ball release), had smaller loading rate at landing the step, and altered the duration from forward bat swing to ball impact. These results might be attributed to lacking visual cues of a live pitcher's whole body kinematics prior to ball release. Without sufficient visual information, greater uncertainty and incomplete weight transfer affected the batter's decision making and movement execution. Conclusion: The batters in this study did adjust their movement strategy in batting against a pitching machine. With dissimilar batting movement patterns under the two delivery conditions, extensive reliance on training with pitching machines is not recommended.","Kuo, Shih-Yu; Cheng, Kuangyou B; Lee, Yu-Chi",Research quarterly for exercise and sport,169,27

However, the neurocognitive mechanisms and processes underlying this risk remain poorly understood. The current longitudinal study examined whether attention network components reflect neurocognitive pathways linking ADHD symptoms with adverse driving outcomes. Method: Drivers from six U.S. sites participating in the Strategic Highway Research Program Naturalistic Driving Study (N=3,226) were prospectively monitored for objectively identified crashes, near-crashes, and crash/near-crash fault. At study entry, drivers were assessed for ADHD symptoms; completed the Conners' Continuous Performance Test, Second Edition; and were then followed continuously for 1-2 years of routine, on-road driving using technology-enhanced in-car monitoring. Bias-corrected, bootstrapped mediation models examined the extent to which attention network components mediated the association between ADHD symptoms and future driving risk, controlling for known risk factors. Results: As expected, self-reported ADHD symptoms predicted all markers of future driving risk. Higher ADHD symptoms were associated with reduced inhibitory control, lower levels of top-down attentional control (endogenous orienting), and greater arousal decrements (phasic alertness). Controlling for ADHD symptoms, top-down attentional control uniquely predicted future crashes, near-crashes, and culpability for future crashes/near-crashes; only arousal decrements portended future near-crashes. Only top-down attentional control significantly mediated the association between baseline ADHD symptoms and future driving risk. Conclusions: The driving risks associated with ADHD appear to be conveyed in part by impairments in the top-down, voluntary control of attention, rather than by difficulties sustaining attention over time or inhibiting impulses, as is often assumed.

Root growth was unaltered by Cd exposure regardless of P conditions, while the degree of root proliferation upon P deficiency was changed by high level of Cd exposure. The concentration and content of Cd accumulation in roots were increased by P deficiency. This can be partially explained by the increased expression of genes encoding PM H + -ATPase under the combined conditions of P deficiency and high Cd exposure, which enhanced Cd2+-H+ exchanges and led to an increment of Cd uptake under P deficiency. Despite of the increasing Cd accumulation in roots, the translocation of Cd from roots to aerial tissues sharply decreased upon P deficiency. The relative expression of genes responsible for Cd translocation (HMA4) decreased upon P deficiency and thus inhibited Cd translocation via xylem. GR activity was decreased by P deficiency, which can inhibit the form of GSH and GSH-Cd complexes and decrease Cd translocation via GSH-Cd complexes. The transportation of PC-Cd complexes into vacuole decreased under P deficiency as a result of the low expression of PCS and ABCC1, and thus suppressed Cd tolerance and Cd detoxification in roots. Moreover, P deficiency decreased the levels of antioxidase (GR and CAT) and phytohormones including JA, ABA and GA3, which synchronously reduced antioxidant capacity in roots.","Wang, Hao; Chen, Wenyi; Sinumvayabo, Narcisse; Li, Yunfei; Han, Zixuan; Tian, Jing; Ma, Qin; Pan, Zhenzhen; Geng, Zhaojun; Yang, Siqi; Kang, Mingming; Rahman, Siddiq Ur; Yang, Guijuan; Zhang, Yi",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,169,8

Repair of this complication was successful; nevertheless, the patient died 5 days after the operation because of multiorgan failure. The cause of this complication can only be speculated, but a relation to the CyroMaze is obvious. Because of the restricted incision with impaired vision especially in the area of the right atrial appendage, the cryoprobe could have come into contact with the orifice of the RCA during the last lesion, with subsequent detachment of the RCA from the aorta, which could subsequently have caused dissection.","Fleck, Tatjana; Dworschak, Martin; Wisser, Wilfried",Innovations,169,1

Yet previous experiments have not tracked demography and trait evolution spanning a full successional cycle to ask whether early bouts of natural selection are later reinforced or erased during periods of population dormancy. In addition, it is unclear how well short-term measures of fitness predict long-term genotypic success for species with dormancy. Here, we address these issues using experimental field populations of the plant Oenothera biennis, which evolved over five generations in plots exposed to or protected from insect herbivory. While populations existed above ground, there was rapid evolution of defensive and life-history traits, but populations lost genetic diversity and crashed as succession proceeded. After >5 y of seed dormancy, we triggered germination from the seedbank and genotyped >3,000 colonizers. Resurrected populations showed restored genetic diversity that reduced earlier responses to selection and pushed population phenotypes toward the starting conditions of a decade earlier. Nonetheless, four defense and life-history traits remained differentiated in populations with insect suppression compared with controls. These findings capture key missing elements of evolution during ecological cycles and demonstrate the impact of dormancy on future evolutionary responses to environmental change.","Agrawal, Anurag A; Hastings, Amy P; Maron, John L",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,169,1

Primary midline restoration provides physiological advantages, and avoidance of mesh may reduce complications. This report describes 128 cases of incisional hernia repair by fascial release. Evolution of the technique produced modifications and fewer complications. METHODS Fascial component separation was performed either by ""classic"" technique (broad skin flaps) in group 1 and by ""perforator preservation"" (fascial release through separate inferolateral incisions) in group 2. RESULTS Mortality was .75% (1/128). Major complications occurred in 7 patients (5.5%). Total recurrence rate is 16% (21/128) with major recurrences in 9.3% (12/128). Both groups were statistically equivalent in demographics, comorbidities, and recurrences. Group 1 had significantly higher rates of skin necrosis (P < .001) and chronic pain (P = .003).

RESULTS We discuss the roles that neuropsychologists can play in assessing and treating the cognitive difficulties and psychiatric symptoms described. CONCLUSIONS At this time, the mechanisms, correlates, and effects of COVID-19 are poorly understood, but information gleaned from the literature on similar viruses and utilized interventions should help inform neuropsychologists as they begin to work with this population.","Rabinovitz, Beth; Jaywant, Abhishek; Fridman, Chaya B",The Clinical neuropsychologist,169,1

Nursing responded to the pandemic with heroic commitment and new politicization. But public engagement with systemic racism is forcing a reckoning in nursing. The profession has its own history of racism and of alliance with systems of state control with which to contend. In this article, we argue nursing must adopt an ethics of abolitionism to realize its goals for health and justice. Abolitionism theorizes that policing and prison systems, originating from systems of enslavement and colonial rule, continue to function as originally intended, causing racial oppression and violence. The harms of these systems will not be resolved through their reform but through creation of entirely new approaches to community support.

METHODS We retrospectively analysed 3548 infants in the newborn nursery in Albuquerque, New Mexico, (elevation 5400 ft) from July 2012 to October 2013. Universal pulse oximetry screening guidelines were employed after 24 hours of life but before discharge. Newborn babies between 36 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation, weighing >2 kg and babies >37 weeks weighing >1.7 kg were included in the study. Log-binomial regression was used to assess change in the probability of false positives over time. RESULTS Of the 3548 patients analysed, there was one true positive with a posteriorly-malaligned ventricular septal defect and an interrupted aortic arch. Of the 93 false positives, the mean pre- and post-ductal saturations were lower, 92 and 90%, respectively. The false-positive rate before April 2013 was 3.5% and after April 2013, decreased to 1.5%. There was a significant decrease in false-positive rate (p = 0.003, slope coefficient = -0.082, standard error of coefficient = 0.023) with the relative risk of a false positive decreasing at 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.97) per month. CONCLUSION This is the first study in Albuquerque, New Mexico, reporting a high false-positive rate of 1.5% at moderate altitude at the end of the study in comparison to the false-positive rate of 0.035% at sea level. Implementation of the nationally recommended universal pulse oximetry screening was associated with a high false-positive rate in the initial period, thought to be from the combination of both learning curve and altitude. After the initial decline, it remained steadily elevated above sea level, indicating the dominant effect of moderate altitude.","Rao, Sruti; Goens, M B; Myers, Orrin B; Sebesta, Emilie A",Cardiology in the young,169,24

Persistent HBV infection is maintained by its episomal genome (covalently closed circular DNA, cccDNA), which acts as a template for viral transcripts. The formation of cccDNA is poorly characterised due to limited ability to quantify it accurately in the presence of replicative intermediates. Here, we describe a novel cccDNA quantification assay (cccDNA inversion quantitative PCR, cinqPCR), which uses restriction enzymes to invert a DNA sequence close to the gap region of Genotype D HBV strains, including the isolate widely-used in experimental studies. Importantly, cinqPCR allows simultaneous normalisation to cellular DNA in a single reaction, provides absolute copy numbers without requiring a standard curve, and has high precision, sensitivity, and specificity for cccDNA compared to previous assays. We first established that cinqPCR gives values consistent with classical approaches in both in vitro and in vivo (humanized mice) HBV infections. We then used cinqPCR to find that cccDNA is formed within 12 hours post-inoculation (hpi). cccDNA formation slowed by 28hpi despite de novo synthesis of HBV DNA, indicating inefficient conversion of new viral genomes to cccDNA within infected cells. Finally, we show that cinqPCR can be used as a 96-well screening assay. Thus, we have developed an ideal method for testing current and future anti-cccDNA therapeutics with high precision and sensitivity.","Tu, Thomas; Zehnder, Benno; Qu, Bingqian; Ni, Yi; Main, Nathan; Allweiss, Lena; Dandri, Maura; Shackel, Nicholas; George, Jacob; Urban, Stephan",Antiviral research,169,1

All these factors increase the risk of obesity in children. In addition, this situation has highlighted potential health problems for obese children. Childhood obesity is an important problem that needs to be addressed in the pandemic process, and appropriate approaches need to be developed and awareness of both parents and children need to be raised about this issue.

It is currently unclear what the COVID-19 disease burden is for these people and whether any of their personal or disease characteristics are associated with contracting COVID-19. Objectives: To explore the proportion of, and characteristics associated with, contracting COVID-19 in children and young people (CYP) with rheumatic diseases and adults with rheumatic diseases from March 2020 to December 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: CYP and adults recruited to the international COVID-19 European Patient Registry, a parent-led, online, self-referred prospective cohort recruiting participants from around the globe, were included in current study if enrolled between 20th March 2020 and 30th December 2020. Demographic information was collected at enrolment and rheumatic disease, diagnoses of COVID-19 and lifestyle factors were collected at weekly intervals. The proportion of CYP and adults diagnosed with COVID-19 were assessed separately. Associations between contraction of COVID-19 at any point over follow-up and participant demographics, rheumatic disease and lifestyle factors at enrolment were assessed descriptively and via Mann-Whitney U-tests, Chisquared tests and Fisher's exact tests. Results: Within 642 CYP and 3646 adults, the majority were female (67%, 89%) and most commonly from the UK (43%, 82%), respectively. The most frequent diagnoses were polyarticular JIA (37%) in the CYP cohort and RA in the adults (63%). Comorbidities were common (45%, 61%) and the majority were taking one or more immunosuppressive therapies (88%, 92%), respectively. At the time of enrolment, 51% and 54% were practising social distancing, respectively. In both cohorts ∼3% contracted COVID-19 at some point during follow-up (n=18 (2.8%) in CYP and n=103 (2.8%) in the adult cohort). In CYP, those who contracted COVID-19 were older (no COVID, median: 10, IQR: 7, 13, vs COVID, median: 14, IQR: 12, 16, p<0.001) and less often had oligoarticular JIA (no COVID: 31%, COVID: 22%) or polyarticular JIA (No COVID: 38%, COVID: 11%). Systemic JIA (no COVID: 7%, COVID: 11%) and enthesitis-related JIA (no COVID: 5%, COVID: 22%) were more common in those who contracted COVID. No other differences between those with and without COVID-19 were observed with respect to country of residence (p=0.335), gender (p=0.624), control of rheumatic disease (p=0.459), comorbidities (p=0.752), immunosuppressive medication (p=0.713) or social distancing (p=0.729). In the adult cohort, those contracting COVID-19 were more commonly from Russia (no COVID: 2%, COVID: 14%) and less commonly from the UK (no COVID: 82%, COVID: 71%, p<0.001). There was greater female representation in those that contracted COVID-19 (no COVID: 88%, COVID: 93%, p=0.022). Although there were no differences in overall presence of comorbidity (p=0.923), kidney disease was overrepresented in those that had contracted COVID-19 (no COVID: 2%, COVID: 8%, p<0.001). Finally, there were lower levels of social distancing in those who contracted COVID (no COVID: 54%, COVID: 44%, p=0.047). There were no significant differences in age (p=0.203), BMI (p=0.617), smoking status (p=0.120), rheumatic disease (p=0.181) and its control (p=0.218) or immunosuppressive use (p=0.208) between those who did and did not contract COVID-19 in the adult cohort. Conclusion: A low proportion of CYP and adults with rheumatic diseases contracted COVID-19 in the 9 months since March 2020. However, given the self-reported nature of the survey and limited testing available across many countries, this study may underestimate the true burden of COVID-19 in the rheumatic disease community. Factors associated with COVID-19 differ between CYP and adults, with age and type of rheumatic disease associated in CYP and gender, kidney comorbidity and social distancing associated in adults.","Shoop-Worrall, S.; Verstappen, S.; Costello, W.; Angevare, S.; Uziel, Y.; Wouters, C.; Wulffraat, N.; Beesley, R.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,169,10

Currently, the backbone of human GWAS approaches is allele-counting-based methods where the signal of association is derived from alleles that are identical-by-state. Borrowing this approach from human GWAS, allele-counting-based methods have been popularized in microbial GWAS, notably the generalized linear model using either dimension reduction for fixed covariates and/or a genetic relationship matrix as a random effect in a mixed model to control for population stratification. In this work, we show how the effects of linkage disequilibrium (LD) can potentially obscure true-positive genotype-phenotype associations (i.e., genetic variants causally associated with the phenotype of interest) and also lead to unacceptably high rates of false-positive associations when applying these classical approaches to GWAS in weakly recombining microbial genomes. We developed a GWAS method called POUTINE (https://github.com/Peter-Two-Point-O/POUTINE), which relies on homoplastic mutation to both clarify the source of putative causal variants and reduce likely false-positive associations compared to traditional allele counting methods. Using datasets of M. tuberculosis genomes and antibiotic-resistance phenotypes, we show that LD can in fact render all association signals from allele counting methods to be fully indistinguishable from hundreds to thousands of sites scattered across an entire genome. These classic GWAS methods thus fail to pinpoint likely causal genotype-phenotype associations and separate them from background noise, even after applying methods to correct for population structure. We therefore urge caution when utilizing classical approaches, particularly in populations that are strongly clonal.","Chen, Peter E.; Shapiro, B. Jesse",bioRxiv,169,1

The implementation of a structured and reliable process for swabbing of potential COVID-19 infected patients became critical. Nevertheless, this process did not come without problems in practice.Around mid-March, it was noticed that over 10% of swab samples collected at Hillingdon Hospital were being rejected for analysis. A root-cause analysis through questionnaires and objective data sampling was conducted with support of internal stakeholders to explore the problem. Practical issues in sample handling linked to inadequate communication and training were identified as the main cause for sample rejection.By the third week of March (i.e. one week in the project), an immediate approach was taken. With support from senior nursing staff, the team created an open space during handovers for the discussion of concerns and issues around sampling and technique. Ward specific figures and details were handed over to the ward sisters to inform each team.During the second stage of interventions, in collaboration with several members of the multidisciplinary team, multiple scripts for an educational video were developed. Several video versions were released based on feedback and following updates from national guidelines. With support of Silver Command, the videos were distributed through the daily email communications and in the Trust’s homepage. The actions implemented had an immediate effect in the overall sample rejection rate, reaching about 5% a month in the project, and dropping to less than 2% in later months.The project improved communication within the teams and cooperation between the multidisciplinary team, highlighting the importance of continuous professional development.

While this containment method is relatively low cost, it is unclear whether similar efficacy can be achieved with lower cost/commercial grade air purifiers, or if such an approach protects healthcare workers against virus aerosol contamination. Method: A total of 109 (10 ml of 108) PhiX174 bacteriophages was nebulized into a sealed clinical room. Surface contamination was detected by settle plates left uncovered during exposure. A healthcare worker remained in the room, personal exposure was determined by skin swabs after exiting the room, following doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE). Four skin areas were swabbed: forearms/hands, neck, forehead, under N95 mask. Three conditions were tested, 1) hood with hospital grade air purifier (IQ Air Health Pro 250), 2) hood with commercial air purifier (Philips 1000i), and 3) control (no hood/air-purification). Findings: The control condition demonstrated extensive environmental and limited skin contamination underneath PPE, which was highest under an N95 mask. The commercial air purifier and hood provided environmental control of virus aerosol and almost zero skin contamination. In comparison, the hospital grade purifier provided complete environmental and skin contamination protection, despite a lower clean air filtration rate (240m3/hr vs 270m3/hr). Virus counts on plates and swabs were significantly lower for both air purifiers and across neck, forehead, and under the N95. There were no statistically significant differences in detected virus counts between air purifiers. Conclusion: This cheap and scalable method may be an effective way to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals by enhancing the effectiveness of PPE worn by health care workers who care for COVID-19 patients and who are exposed to virus aerosol.","Landry, S.

Reverse genetics systems for many CoVs have been established, but none exist for ToVs. Here, we describe a reverse genetics system using a full-length infectious cDNA clone of bovine ToV (BToV) in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Recombinant BToV containing genetic markers had the same phenotype as wild-type (wt) BToV. To generate two types of recombinant virus, the Hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene was manipulated, since cell-adapted wtBToV generally loses the full-length HE (HEf), resulting in soluble HE (HEs). First, recombinant viruses with HEf and HA-tagged HEf or HEs genes were rescued; these showed no significant differences in cell growth, suggesting that HE is not essential for viral growth in cells. Then, recombinant virus in which HE was replaced by the Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) gene expressed EGFP in infected cells, but showed significantly reduced viral growth compared to wtBToV. Moreover, the recombinant virus readily deleted the EGFP gene after one passage. Interestingly, one variant with mutations in non-structural proteins (NSPs) showed improved EGFP expression and viral growth during serial passages, although it eventually deleted the EGFP gene, suggesting that these mutations contributed to EGFP gene acceptance. These recombinant viruses provide new insights regarding BToV and its reverse genetics will help advance understanding of this neglected pathogen. Importance ToVs are diarrhea-causing pathogens that have been detected in many species, including humans. BToV has spread worldwide, leading to economic losses. We developed the first reverse genetics system for Tobaniviridae using a BAC-based BToV. Using this system, we showed that recombinant BToVs with HEf and HEs showed no significant differences in cell growth. In contrast, clinical BToVs generally lose the HE gene after a few passages but some recombinant viruses retained the HE gene for up to 20 passages, suggesting some benefits of HE retention. The EGFP gene of the recombinant viruses was unstable and was rapidly deleted, likely via negative selection. Interestingly, one virus variant with mutations in NSPs was more stable, resulting in improved EGFP-expression and viral growth, suggesting that the mutations contributed to some acceptance of the exogenous EGFP gene without clear positive selection. The recombinant BToVs and reverse genetics developed here are powerful tools for understanding fundamental viral processes and their pathogenesis and for developing BToV vaccines.","Makoto, Ujike; Yuka, Etoh; Naoya, Urushiyama; Fumihiro, Taguchi; Luis, Enjuanes; Wataru, Kamitani",bioRxiv,169,1

However, a small number of them, acting maliciously, can raise many security risks. Recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities for object detection can be very useful for the identification and classification of drones flying in the airspace and, in particular, are a good solution against malicious drones. A number of counter-drone solutions are being developed, but the cost of drone detection ground systems can also be very high, depending on the number of sensors deployed and powerful fusion algorithms. We propose a low-cost counter-drone solution composed uniquely by a guard-drone that should be able to detect, locate and eliminate any malicious drone. In this paper, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm is used to train the system to detect drones. Three existing object detection models are improved by transfer learning and tested for real-time drone detection. Training is done with a new dataset of drone images, constructed automatically from a very realistic flight simulator. While flying, the guard-drone captures random images of the area, while at the same time, a malicious drone is flying too. The drone images are auto-labelled using the location and attitude information available in the simulator for both drones. The world coordinates for the malicious drone position must then be projected into image pixel coordinates. The training and test results show a minimum accuracy improvement of 22% with respect to state-of-the-art object detection models, representing promising results that enable a step towards the construction of a fully autonomous counter-drone system.","Çetin, E.; Barrado, C.; Pastor, E.",The Aeronautical Journal,169,24

There have been various debates among philosophers on this issue. Some philosophers reject the new administration policies by claiming that the ‘physical distance’ required for health has been used for power under the name of ‘social distance’ with the custody of the street and point out that these policies have created new forms of control, among economically, politically, and socially. Some others are more hopeful and believe that the crisis can build a new economic and social life;it can be an opportunity to find a new starting point;especially from being confined in the pandemic process. The author will refer to Agamben’s thoughts to understand how the state of exception turned into a rule and how it affects street politics. In this context, COVID-19 is seen as a ‘state of exception’ that normalises all the dominative practices, strengthens sovereignty by designing the social/economical life like a camp. In the pandemic process, people were accustomed to isolation by the administrations under the name of social distance, just like in a camp life.

Considering the prices of investigated animal products, there were increases at different rates in all products during the pandemic (1.82-11.57%). While the differences between producer prices of beef and broiler meat before and during the pandemic were found to be statistically significant (P<0.05), the changes in lamb meat and egg prices were not statistically significant. On the other hand, feed prices were found to be increased by 9.71-12.57%. It was determined that the feed, which is the most critical input of producers, showed a significant increase (P<0.05) during the pandemic, especially in the poultry sector. During the pandemic, the highest reduction in livestock product/feed parity was experienced in the egg sector, with -10.28%. In conclusion, examined animal product prices increased during the pandemic period, but input prices increased more than products.

Pandemi öncesi ve sırasında sığır eti ve piliç eti üretici fiyatları arasındaki fark istatistiksel olarak anlamlı bulunurken (P<0,05), kuzu eti ve yumurta fiyatlarındaki değişiklikler istatistiksel olarak anlamlı bulunmamıştır. Diğer taraftan, girdi maliyetleri yönünden yaşanan değişiklikleri göstermesi bakımından yem fiyatları da incelenmiş ve %9,71-12,57 oranında arttığı tespit edilmiştir. Üreticilerin en önemli girdisi olan yemin pandemi döneminde özellikle kanatlı sektöründe önemli düzeyde artış (P<0,05) gösterdiği belirlenmiştir. Pandemi sırasında hayvansal ürün/yem paritesindeki en fazla azalma -%10,28 ile yumurta sektöründe yaşanmıştır. Sonuç olarak, pandemi döneminde hayvansal ürün fiyatları artmış ancak girdi fiyatlarında artış daha fazla olmuştur. Ayrıca üreticilerin pandemi döneminde başta yumurta tavukçuluğu olmak üzere ürün/yem paritesi değerlerine göre daha düşük karlılıkla çalışmak zorunda kaldıkları belirlenmiştir.

It is even more evident in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Fact-checking efforts have expanded greatly and have been touted as among the most promising solutions to fake news, especially in times like these. Several studies have reported the development of fact-checking organizations in Western societies, albeit little attention has been given to the Global South. Here, to fill this gap, we introduce a novel Markov-inspired computational method for identifying topics in tweets. In contrast to other topic modeling approaches, our method clusters topics and their current evolution in a predefined time window. Through these, we collected data from Twitter accounts of two Brazilian fact-checking outlets and presented the topics debunked by these initiatives in fortnights throughout the pandemic. By comparing these organizations, we could identify similarities and differences in what was shared by them. Our method resulted in an important technique to cluster topics in a wide range of scenarios, including an infodemic -- a period overabundance of the same information. In particular, the data clearly revealed a complex intertwining between politics and the health crisis during this period. We conclude by proposing a generic model which, in our opinion, is suitable for topic modeling and an agenda for future research.","Ceron, Wilson; de-Lima-Santos, Mathias-Felipe; Quiles, Marcos G.",,169,16

Therein, young people were amongst the hardest hit groups, with youth unemployment rising as high as 50% in some member states. Particularly high rates of youth unemployment were often observed in rural areas, where labour market supply in relation to demand were notably divergent. One of the core pillars of the EU’s agenda is to tackle the persistent problem of youth unemployment. Since the recent crisis, this has been via the “Youth on the Move” initiative, which involves the promotion of intra- and international mobility of young adults in order to gain access to job opportunities. However, what has received little attention so far is the question of what the general willingness of young adults to move is like, and to what extent this varies, for example, depending upon the area they live in. This paper therefore asks if rural youth differ from youth in urban areas in relation to their willingness to move for a job within their country or to another country. Moreover, what influences the general willingness to be mobile? Based on the Cultural Pathways to Economic Self-Sufficiency and Entrepreneurship (CUPESSE) Survey, which includes data on 18–35-year-olds in a sample of 11 European countries, it is shown that living in a rural area is strongly associated with the willingness to move. Furthermore, it shows that rural youth are more willing to move within the country but less willing to move to another country. Based on the presentation of the various factors, which promote or curb mobility readiness, the results make it clear that the success of EU initiatives depends on the preferences and willingness of the target group in question.","Weiss, Julia Ferrante Livio Soler-Porta Mariano",Sustainability,169,27

OBJECTIVES To explore the lived experiences of care-home staff in implementing ICMs. METHODS Mixed-methods study comprising 238 online survey responses and 15 in-depth interviews with care-home staff, November 2020-January 2021 in England. RESULTS Three themes were identified: Integrating COVID-19 ICMs with caring, Conveying knowledge and information, Professional and personal impacts of care-work during the pandemic. Reported adherence to ICMs was high but fatalistic attitudes towards COVID-19 infection were present. Challenges of providing care using personal protective equipment (PPE), especially for residents with dementia, were highlighted. Interviewees reported dilemmas between strictly implementing ICMs and conflicts with providing best care to residents and preserving personal space. Nine months into COVID-19, official guidance was reported as confusing, constantly changing and poorly suited to care-homes. Care-home staff appreciated opportunities to work with other care-homes and experts to interpret and implement guidance. ICM training was undertaken using multiple techniques but with little evaluation of these or how to sustain behaviour change. Limitations Results may not be generalizable to other countries. Implications COVID-19 has had a profound effect on well-being of care-home staff. Despite challenges, participants reported broadly good morale, potentially a consequence of supportive colleagues and management. Nevertheless, clear, concise and care-home focussed ICM guidance is still needed. This should include evidence-based assessments on implementing and sustaining adherence. Groups of care-home staff and ICM experts working together to co-create, interpret and implement guidance were viewed positively.","Bunn, D.; Brainard, J. S.; Lane, K.; Salter, C.; Lake, I.

With such high variability in demand for urgently needed products (e.g., personal protective equipment, testing technologies) and shifts in the needed capabilities of already complex production systems, sustainability challenges concerning waste management, life cycle impact characterization, and production operations have come to light. An extensive amount of data can be extracted from manufacturing systems, but it is not yet being used to improve the performance of production systems and maintain sustainability strategies during times of distress. This article proposes the concept of a Digital Depot. Being virtual in nature, the depot can contain plans and data for many different types of crises and contain a wider array of products than would be available in a physical, national stockpile. The information could be made available on demand to a national base of manufacturers to help them swiftly pivot to the production of critically needed goods while building on their existing manufacturing capabilities. The contents of the Digital Depot would be applicable to several stages pertinent to manufacturing operations including product definition, production planning information, asset and factory-level data, as well as data concerning the supply chain, distribution, and end-of-life stages.

The existing polishing methods have several limitations such as bluntness of tool due to loading, metallurgical changes on the polished surface due to frictional heat generated at the interface, etc. These limitations have prompted the researchers to develop self-sharpening polishing tools. One such method is Ice Bonded Abrasive Polishing (IBAP) which uses frozen slurry for polishing, where ice serves as a matrix to hold the abrasives. Frictional heat produced at tool work interface causes the tool to melt and thus exposes fresh abrasives present in different layers. This paper attempts to interpret the mechanisms responsible for the ultrafine surface generation and then to develop an analytical model for estimating material removal. During polishing, the asperities on work surface experience variable force due to the changing condition of the tool with time. Initially, the first layer of rigid ice with fixed abrasives interacts with the work surface, making it as a solid-solid interaction. Molten state of ice behaves as semisolid and leads to slurry formation afterward. Therefore, the work surface will experience two-body and three-body interactions simultaneously. The proposed model implements the concepts of contact mechanics for predicting material removal from the work surface and finally, the effectiveness of the model has been validated with experimental results.","Nayak, Bedamati; Babu, N.

AWJ requires the purchase and disposal of costly abrasive particles which increases manufacturing costs and environmental-footprint. This motivates the exploration for low-cost, eco-friendly alternatives. A novel method which utilizes a stream of high-speed water droplets (WD) travelling through a sub-atmospheric pressure environment to remove material without using abrasive grit is presented. In this paper, the efficacy of this new process is investigated and compared to AWJ and pure water jet (WJ) (i.e., without abrasive particles) by measuring the material removal rates (MRR) of each process on a hard-to-machine steel, DP 1180, for equivalent water-flow conditions. Trench profiles are created by traversing each of the jets across a metal sample, from which the MRR and trench profiles are obtained. The MRR results reveal that WD is significantly faster than WJ, but is subordinate compared to AWJ for MRR efficiency. This identifies a trade-off between manufacturing cost and time.","Mitchell, Benjamin R.; Demian, Sohani A.R.; Korkolis, Yannis P.; Kinsey, Brad L.",Procedia Manufacturing,169,29

The process allows attaining commercial sterility with a very minimal impact on the product's nutritional value. The quality, stability, acceptability, and sensorial properties of the products are affected by the combined influence of the quality of the raw milk, processing details, and storage conditions. Detailed information about the mechanisms that govern the evolution and severity of physicochemical instabilities in the final product, such as enzymatic- and non-enzymatic age gelation, sedimentation, and creaming has been established. This understanding highlights the adverse effects of residual activities of heat-stable proteases from psychrotrophic bacteria and plasmin on the quality and stability of UHT milk. These activities, along with the effects of heat treatment and storage temperature on the physicochemical properties, composition, and distribution of milk proteins, as well as the influence of pH and ionic composition, govern the manifestation of the afore-stated instabilities in UHT milk. Ensuring the quality and stability of UHT milk calls for utilizing milk with as low as possible somatic cell counts, maintaining the psychrotrophic bacteria counts of milk as low as possible as well as understanding the effects of the stage in lactation and seasonality of the properties of the raw milk. The sensorial quality of UHT milk reflects the accumulation of different volatile and non-volatile flavor and aroma impacting compounds that originate from the effects of heat treatment and storage conditions on the proteins, carbohydrates, and lipid constituents of milk. It can be also argued that the availability of high-quality and stable UHT milk products is of special importance during the time of disrupted supply chain, such as that during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.","Rosenberg, M.",Encyclopedia of Dairy Sciences (Third Edition),169,1

Objectives: Aim of the study was to compare the prevalence of QTc prolongation between COVID19 and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients treated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Methods: We included consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab and patients taking HCQ for SLE. A prolonged QTc was defined as an increase in QTc intervals ≥60 ms (compared with baseline) or as a QTc of ≥500 ms. Results: We enrolled 58 COVID19 patients (median age 70.5 years, IQR 25). HCQ, without or with azithromycin, was given to 26 (44.8%) and 15 patients (25.9%), respectively;17 (29.3%) had not received either drug. The median baseline QTc was 432 (IQR 36) and prolonged QTc was observed in 15 (26%) patients (12 QTc≥500 ms and 3 patients ΔQTc≥60 ms). We didn't find significant differences in QTc prolongation among the three treatment groups. Baseline QTc (OR 111.5) and D-dimer (OR 78.3) were independently associated to QTc prolongation. Compared to the 50 SLE patients (median age of 38.5 years, IQR 22), chronically treated with HCQ, patients with COVID19 showed significantly longer QTc (p < 0.001) (Table 1). Conclusion: This is the first study demonstrating that, differently from COVID19 patients, patients with SLE are not susceptible to HCQ-induced long QT syndrome and arrhythmia.

Through this global spread, many nations have witnessed exponential growth of confirmed cases brought under control by severe mass quarantine or measures. However, some have, through a different timeline of actions, prevented this exponential growth. Currently as some continue to tackle growth, others attempt to safely lift restrictions whilst avoiding a resurgence. This study seeks to quantify the impact of government actions in mitigating viral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by a novel soft computing approach that makes concurrent use of a neural network model, to predict the daily slope increase of cumulative infected, and an optimiser, with a parametrisation of the government restriction time series, to understand the best set of mitigating actions. Data for two territories, Italy and Taiwan, have been gathered to model government restrictions in travelling, testing and enforcement of social distance measures as well as people connectivity and adherence to government actions. It is found that a larger and earlier testing campaign with tighter entry restrictions benefit both regions, resulting in significantly less confirmed cases. Interestingly, this scenario couples with an earlier but milder implementation of nationwide restrictions for Italy, thus supporting Taiwans lack of nationwide lockdown, i.e. earlier government actions could have contained the growth to a degree that a widespread lockdown would have been avoided, or at least delayed. The results, found with a purely data-driven approach, are in line with the main findings of mathematical epidemiological models, proving that the proposed approach has value and that the data alone contains valuable knowledge to inform decision makers.","Riccardi, A.; Gemignani, J.; Fernandez-Navarro, F.; Heffernan, A.",Ieee Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence,169,24

However, any such model will rely on parameters that are unknown, which in practice are estimated using stochastic and poorly measured quantities. As a result, an early prediction of the long-term evolution of a pandemic will quickly lose relevance, while a late model will be too late to be useful for disaster management. Unless a model is designed to be adaptive, it is bound either to lose relevance over time, or lose trust and thus not have a second-chance for retraining. We propose a strategy for estimating the number of infections and the number of deaths, that does away with time-series modeling, and instead makes use of a 'phase portrait approach'. We demonstrate that, with this approach, there is a universality to the evolution of the disease across countries, that can then be usedto make reliable predictions. These same models can also be used to plan the requirements for critical resources during the pandemic. The approach is designed for simplicity of interpretation, and adaptivity over time. Using our model, we predict the number of infections and deaths in Italy and New York State, based on an adaptive algorithm which uses early available data, and show that our predictions closely match the actual outcomes. We also carry out a similar exercise for India, where in addition to projecting the number of infections and deaths, we also project the expected range of critical resource requirements for hospitalizations in a location.","Prakash, Meher K; Kaushal, Shaurya; Bhattacharya, Soumyadeep; Chandran, Akshay; Kumar, Aloke; Ansumali, Santosh",,169,25

Unsupervised cluster analysis revealed that DNA methylomes of cells from TB-exposed individuals and controls appeared as separate clusters and the numerous genes that were differentially methylated were functionally connected. The enriched pathways were strongly correlated to data from published work on protective heterologous immunity to TB. Taken together, our results demonstrate that epigenetic changes related to trained immunity occurs in the pulmonary immune cells of TB-exposed individuals and that a DNA methylation signature can be derived from the DNA methylome.

For this purpose, we collected data from participants through online questionnaires to measure emergency stress, coping strategies, hardiness, and secondary trauma. Other variables analyzed were age, sex, direct contact with COVID-19 patients, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). We performed a correlational analysis, regressions, and a mediation analysis. The results show that nurses and physicians experienced higher levels of emergency stress than emergency workers.

The importance of workplace as a characteristic of interest in population-based studies has become increasingly apparent over time. Most adults spend a majority of their waking hours living in their workplace environment, which serves as a source of unique as well as shared exposures, stressors, and related determinants of health. A rapidly expanding segment of the working population includes those individuals who work in the fields of healthcare. The healthcare workforce, at large, represents an increasingly diverse subset of the population with broad exposures; some exposures are specific to the workplace and others are common to persons living in the community. Importantly, healthcare workers tend to have general interest and willingness to participate in research, in addition to stable employment and easy access to on-site clinical research assessment locations.

The CPP programme aims to develop socially engaged artists who contribute to the world as performance-makers, educators, advocates and active citizens. In these months where there was a palimpsest of crises, all clamouring for our attention, we had to consider what it means to make art and educate artists in the context of a pandemic. When the UK-wide lockdown happened at the end of March our working practices as we knew them ceased and we had to find ways to deliver our curriculum online and encourage our student artists to be responsive, creative and curious about what the move to digital platforms could offer our artforms. Conceived through the conceptualisation of online spaces as utopias/dystopias, this article disseminates the way in which our learning and teaching has adapted to respond to the challenge of social distancing and isolation and how we have found new ways of working, training and being a community of artists in these unprecedented circumstances. CPP is an interdisciplinary performance-making degree focused on the generation of new and original performances that sit outside of traditional theatre and is committed to exploring the ecological and social function of performance and how performance can be an 'act of community.' Here, we reflect on how making art in an emergency is necessarily as much about creating the kinds of spaces and experiences that that are needed as it is about directly engaging with the politics, issues and wider ideas of crises.","Bissell, L.; Gardiner, G.; Hopfinger, S.; O'Neill, R.",Performance Research,169,1

The national lockdown and mobilization of healthcare resources to areas with increased demand has resulted in a historical shift in referral, diagnostic and surgical capabilities in most healthboards. This regional, retrospective study aimed to shed light on the potential consequences of the UK national lockdown, the resultant decrease in referrals and diagnostic capacity on surgical services and patients during the recovery phase.Methods:Urgent referrals for suspected (USC) prostate cancer (N =1430) from primary care in the north-east of Scotland and the number of diagnostic prostate biopsies performed in the region were reviewed to assess trends between January 2018 and December 2020. The data was anonymized and charted to highlight the differences between the period of national lockdown and other times.Results:The number of USC referrals for prostate cancer dropped significantly between March 2020 and June 2020 (a mean of 25 per month from 45 per month in the same period in 2018 and 2019). The number of diagnostic procedures also decreased significantly, with 74 fewer biopsies having been performed during the lockdown period compared with the same period in 2019.Conclusions:The shifts in USC referrals and diagnostics during the lockdown period have led to a backlog which may put patients at risk of cancer stage migration, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. This study indicates that reestablishment of surgical services should take priority during the recovery phase.Level of evidence: 3","Maresca, Gianluca Siddiqui Saad Wardlaw Kevin Royle Justine",Journal of Clinical Urology,169,22

Often outbreak investigations aim to identify who infected whom by reconstructing the outbreak transmission tree, which visualizes transmission between individuals as a network with nodes representing individuals and branches representing transmission from person to person. We compiled a database of 383 published, standardized transmission trees consisting of 16 directly-transmitted diseases ranging in size from 2 to 286 cases. For each tree and disease we calculated several key statistics, such as outbreak size, average number of secondary infections, the dispersion parameter, and the number of superspreaders. We demonstrated the potential utility of the database through short analyses addressing questions about superspreader epidemiology for a variety of diseases, including COVID-19. First, we compared the frequency and contribution of superspreaders to onward transmission across diseases. COVID-19 outbreaks had significantly fewer superspreaders than outbreaks of SARS and MERS and a dispersion parameter between that of SARS and MERS. Across diseases the presence of more superspreaders was associated with greater outbreak size. Second, we further examined how early spread impacts tree size. Generally, trees sparked by a superspreader had larger outbreak sizes than those trees not sparked by a superspreader, and this trend was significant for COVID-19 trees. Third, we investigated patterns in how superspreaders are infected. Across trees with more than one superspreader, we found support for the theory that superspreaders generate other superspreaders, even when controlling for number of secondary infections. In sum, our findings put the role of superspreading to COVID-19 transmission in perspective with that of SARS and MERS and suggest an avenue for further research on the generation of superspreaders. These data have been made openly available to encourage reuse and further scientific inquiry.","Taube, J. C.; Miller, P. B.; Drake, J. M.",,169,25

This study examined glucose management and diabetes-related hospitalizations in YA with T1D during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Surveys were distributed electronically to YA between 17-30 years old and associated with the College Diabetes Network at two timepoints (spring and fall 2020). The survey included questions about hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis and/or severe hypoglycemia and challenges filling prescriptions. Chi-Square statistics were used for analyses. Results: No demographic differences were found between the spring (n=473) and fall (n=375) participants. There was a significant increase in hospitalizations for severe hypoglycemia from 3.4% in the spring to 10.4% in the fall (p<.001). In the spring, 21% of participants reported difficulty filling prescriptions due to COVID-19, compared to 7.3% in the fall. Among those who reported difficulty filling prescriptions, insulin (Spring [n=58], Fall [n=43]) and CGM supplies (Spring [n=41], Fall [n=22]) were most commonly cited. Reported hospitalizations for DKA increased from 6.7% in the spring to 10.1% in the fall and trending towards statistical significance (p=.077). Conclusions: YA with T1D reported increased incidence of severe hypoglycemia hospitalization during COVID-19, with many YA reporting difficulty filling and obtaining insulin and CGM supplies.

Unfortunately, many hermatypic corals in aquaria are not identified to species level, which hinders assessment of their conservation significance. Traditional methods of species identification using morphology can be challenging, especially to non-taxonomists. DNA barcoding is an option for species identification of Scleractinian corals, especially when used in concert with morphology-based assessment. This study uses DNA barcodes to try to identify aquarium specimens of the diverse reef-forming genus Acropora from 127 samples. We identified to our best current knowledge, to species name 44% of the analysed samples and provided provisional identification for 80% of them (101/127, in the form of a list of species names with associate confidence values). We highlighted a sampling bias in public nucleotide sequences repertories (e.g.: GenBank) towards more charismatic and more studied species, even inside a well-studied genus like Acropora. In addition, we showed a potential “single observer” effect with over a quarter of the reference sequences used for these identifications coming from the same study. We propose the use of barcoding and query matching as an additional tool for taxonomic experts and general aquarists, as an additional tool to increase their chances of making high confidence species-level identifications. We produce a standardised and easily repeatable methodology to increase the capacity of aquariums and other facilities to assess non-ascribed species, emphasising the value of integrating this approach with morphological identification optimising usage of authoritative identification guides and expert opinion.","Colin, Luigi; Abed-Navandi, Daniel; Conde, Dalia A.; Craggs, Jamie; da Silva, Rita; Janse, Max; Källström, Björn; Pearce-Kelly, Alexander; yesson, Chris",bioRxiv,169,12

Our institution adopted IT morphine and fentanyl (morphine+fentanyl) as an adjuvant to hyperbaric bupivacaine for CD from 2019 due to supply issues. Given differences in lipid solubility of the two drugs, IT morphine could have prolonged effects, resulting in superior analgesia at 24 h post CD, but at the risk of worse side effects (nausea, pruritus). Given the multidimensional nature of post-CD recovery, IT morphine could result in poorer overall quality of recovery. Methods: We retrospectively analysed audit data for elective CD over six weeks in early 2017 for the IT diamorphine protocol (300–350 [Formula presented]);n = 119, and over 10 weeks from July–Sept 2020 for IT morphine (125–150 [Formula presented]) +fentanyl (15 [Formula presented]);n = 100. Both groups followed the same enhanced recovery (ER) protocol except for IT opioids. Women received IV ondansetron 4mg. At 24 h post-CD, women were interviewed on the ward using the ObsQoR-10 recovery scoring tool (ObsQoR-11 in 2017, data adjusted for comparison), which includes relevant recovery items (pain, nausea).2 Number of nights hospital stay was recorded. Results: Clinical characteristics of women were similar between groups. Morphine+fentanyl was associated with lower ObsQoR-10 scores at 24 h compared to diamorphine, indicating poorer recovery (Table). Greater ObsQoR pain item scores (i.e. less pain) were found with morphine+fentanyl at 24 h. ObsQoR nausea and vomiting item scores were worse (lower score) in the morphine+fentanyl group. Number of nights hospital stay was similar between groups. [Formula presented] Discussion: Our data suggest that IT morphine+fentanyl was associated with improved analgesia at 24 h post-CD compared to diamorphine, but with worse side effects leading to a reduced quality of recovery at 24 h. This did not, however, impact length of stay. Our data are observational and so can suffer from bias. Morphine data were collected during the Covid-19 pandemic, which could be a confounding factor. However, we believe IT diamorphine may have advantages over IT morphine to promote ER, but we require higher quality studies with prospective randomised controlled trials.","Ciechanowicz, S.; Oyewole, M.; Neall, G.; Patel, N.",International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia,169,16

It can also identify the source of the outbreak and provide lessons to improve infection prevention and control strategies. In this manuscript, we outline the obstacles we encountered in order to genotype SARS-CoV-2 in real-time during an urgent outbreak investigation. In this process, we encountered problems with the length of the original genotyping protocol, reagent stockout and sample degradation and storage. However, we managed to set up three different library preparation methods for sequencing in Illumina. We also managed to decrease the hands on library preparation time from twelve to three hours, which allowed us to complete the outbreak investigation in just a few weeks. We also fine-tuned a simple bioinformatics workflow for the assembly of high-quality genomes in real-time. In order to allow other laboratories to learn from our experience, we released all of the library preparation and bioinformatics protocols publicly and distributed them to other laboratories of the South African Network for Genomics Surveillance (SANGS) consortium.","Pillay, Sureshnee; Giandhari, Jennifer; Tegally, Houriiyah; Wilkinson, Eduan; Chimukangara, Benjamin; Lessells, Richard; Moosa, Yunus; Gazy, Inbal; Fish, Maryam; Singh, Lavanya; Khanyile, Khulekani Sedwell; Fonseca, Vagner; Giovanetti, Marta; Alcantara, Luiz Carols; de Oliveira, Tulio",bioRxiv,169,1

Although isolation at any age is harmful, previous studies have shown that isolation during adolescence, correlating with critical periods of brain development, can impair cognitive function and increase the risk for psychiatric illness later in life. In this study, we utilized a mouse model of adolescent social isolation (SI) and compared performance of isolated and group-housed mice on touchscreen-based continuous performance test (CPT) and fixed ratio/progressive ratio (FR/PR) tasks in adulthood. SI increased sensitivity in the CPT in male mice and had no effect in female mice. The increase in sensitivity was consistent across time bins within the 45-minute testing session and there were no SI effects on reaction times or reward retrieval latencies. A possible confound for performance in the CPT would be SI-induced changes in reward-seeking or motivation for the strawberry milk reward. We next compared the SI mice to their group-housed littermate controls on both FR and PR schedules of reinforcement and found that male SI mice earned significantly more reinforcers on FR schedules of reinforcement and had higher breakpoints on PR schedules compared to their group-housed littermates. SI had no effect on FR or PR performance in female mice. These data indicate that SI during adolescence has striking, sex-specific effects on reward-seeking behavior in adult mice and may provide a useful behavioral model for studying the link between SI and risk for neuropsychiatric disorders.","Noback, Michael; Barrow, James C.; Carr, Gregory V.",bioRxiv,169,1

Especially, deep learning algorithms have been adopted in several studies and promising results have been obtained. However, the cross-domain fault diagnostic problem still remains a challenging issue, where the training and testing data are collected from different operating conditions of the machine. To bridge the domain gap in the training and testing data and increase the model generalization ability, a domain adaptation approach is proposed in this paper within the deep learning framework. Multiple convolutional operations are employed for automatic feature extraction. The maximum mean discrepancy is used to optimize the distributions of the learned features for accurate diagnosis. To further enhance the model generalization ability, the health condition labels of the data are injected with additional noise during model training. Experiments on a bearing fault diagnosis dataset are carried out for validation. The results show that, compared with the popular transfer learning algorithms, the proposed method with noisy health labels can successfully improve the cross-domain diagnosis performance on rotating machines.","Ainapure, Abhijeet; Li, Xiang; Singh, Jaskaran; Yang, Qibo; Lee, Jay",Procedia Manufacturing,169,1

As SARS-CoV-2 is a Biosafety level (BSL)-3 pathogen, real world testing of heat as a sanitation method for public and private vehicles becomes a challenge, requiring a surrogate coronavirus that can be handled safely outside of a BSL-3 facility. In this study, we used Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 to test the efficacy of heat-based betacoronavirus inactivation. In vitro, a 30-minute exposure to 56°C completely inactivated BCoV in solution, and a 15-minute exposure reduced recovery of BCoV >1000-fold. When heated to 56°C for 15 minutes, the infectivity of BCoV spotted and dried on typical porous and non-porous automobile interior materials was reduced by 99 - 99.99%. When BCoV was spotted and dried on hard plastic (seat) material placed inside an out of service transit bus, 56°C heat for 30 minutes reduced BCoV infectivity 85 - 99.5%. Thus, 56°C is an accessible, rapid, and effective method to inactivate coronaviruses inside motor vehicles.","Karthigeyan, Krithika P.; Flanigan, Chloe; Machado, Denis Jacob; Kiziltas, Alper A.; Janies, Daniel A.; Chen, Jay; Cooke, David; Lee, Marcia V.; Saif, Linda J.; Henegar, Sonny; Jahnes, Jeff; Mielewski, Deborah F.; Kwiek, Jesse J.",bioRxiv,169,1

To address recent concerns over age-based ICU decision-making we explored patient-assessed quality of life (QoL) in ICU survivors. METHODS We conducted a rapid database search of cohort studies published between January 2000 to April 2020, of elderly patients admitted to ICUs. We extracted data on self-reported QoL (EQ-5D composite score), study characteristics and demographic and clinical variables. Using a random-effects model, we then compared QoL scores at follow-up to scores either before admission, age-matched population controls or younger ICU survivors. Finally, we conducted follow-up quantitative analyses to explore potential moderators of these effects, and a qualitative synthesis of QoL subscores. A study protocol was registered prospectively on PROSPERO, ID: CRD42020181181. FINDINGS Our database search found 2536 studies and from these we reviewed 376 potentially relevant full texts. 21 of these studies met the inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis and 18 were also included in the meta-analysis (N= 2090 elderly adults). The follow-up periods ranged between 3-100 months. There was no significant difference in the elderlys QoL scores between one month before ICU and follow-up, or between follow-up and age-matched community controls. QoL in elderly ICU survivors was significantly worse than younger ICU survivors, with a small-to-medium effect size (d= .33 [.10 to .55]). Mortality rates and length of follow up were possible intermediary factors. The qualitative synthesis suggested that any reductions in QoL were primarily due to reductions in physical health, rather than mental health items. INTERPRETATION Overall, elderly ICU patients did not experience significantly impaired QoL at follow up, compared to before ICU or their healthy peers. Elderly patients who survive ICU can be expected to have slightly worse QoL compared to younger patients, especially in the long-term. The results suggest that the proportionality of age as a determinant of (population level) ICU resource allocation should be kept under close review and that subjective QoL outcomes (not only objective survival data) should inform person-centred decision making in elderly ICU patients.","Ariyo, K.; Canestrini, S.; David, A.; Ruck Keene, A.; Owen, G.

In this process the lipids have to undergo considerable rearrangement. The nature of the intermediates that are formed during this rearrangement has been investigated. Certain fusion proteins facilitate this process. In many cases short segments of these fusion proteins have a particularly important role in accelerating the fusion process. Studies of the interaction of model peptides with membranes have allowed for increased understanding at the molecular level of the mechanism of the promotion of membrane fusion by fusion proteins. There is an increased appreciation of the roles of several independent segments of fusion proteins in promoting the fusion process. Many of the studies of the fusion of biological membranes have been done with the fusion of enveloped viruses with other membranes. One reason for this is that the number of proteins involved in viral fusion is relatively simple, often requiring only a single protein. For many enveloped viruses, the structure of their fusion proteins has certain common elements, suggesting that they all promote fusion by an analogous mechanism. Some aspects of this mechanism also appears to be common to intracellular fusion, although several proteins are involved in that process which is more complex and regulated than is viral fusion.","Epand, R M",Bioscience reports,169,16

Different viruses insert different distributions of guanylates, e.g., Sendai virus inserts a single G, whereas parainfluenza virus type 3 inserts one to six Gs. The sequences conserved at the editing site, as well as the experimental evidence, suggest that the insertions occur by a stuttering process, i.e., by pseudotemplated transcription. The number of times the polymerase ""stutters"" at the editing site before continuing strictly templated elongation is directed by a cis-acting sequence found upstream of the insertions. We have examined the stuttering process during natural virus infections by constructing recombinant Sendai viruses with mutations in their cis-acting sequences. We found that the template stutter site is precisely determined (C1052) and that a relatively short region (approximately 6 nucleotides) just upstream of the AnGn run can modulate the overall frequency of mRNA editing as well as the distribution of the nucleotide insertions. The positions more proximal to the 5' AnGn run are the most important in this respect. We also provide evidence that the stability of the mRNA/template hybrid plays a determining role in the overall frequency and range of mRNA editing. When the template U run is extended all the way to the stutter site, adenylates rather than guanylates are added at the editing site and their distribution begins to resemble the polyadenylation associated with mRNA 3' end formation by the viral polymerase. Our data suggest how paramyxovirus mRNA editing and polyadenylation are related mechanistically and how editing sites may have evolved from poly(A)-termination sites or vice versa.","Hausmann, S; Garcin, D; Delenda, C; Kolakofsky, D",Journal of virology,169,1

Differences in the pathogenicity, antigenicity and tissue tropism have been observed among porcine coronaviruses. Although porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) is antigenically similar but not identical to TGEV isolates, these respiratory coronaviruses differ markedly in pathogenicity and tissue tropism compared to TGEV isolates. Using a reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RT/PCR-RFLP) assay, TGEV and PRCV isolates were assigned to several distinct groups. By RFLP analysis of the 5' region of the S gene, TGEV strains were differentiated into 4 groups using the restriction enzyme Sau3AI. A fifth Sau3AI group contained the PRCV isolates. These 5 groups correlated with antigenic groups previously defined using monoclonal antibodies in our laboratory. Several restriction enzymes could be used to differentiate the TGEV strains into Miller and Purdue types. Analysis of a PCR amplified product in the 3 and 3-1 genes indicated the RT/PCR-RFLP assay results for TGEV Miller strains could be correlated with lower virulence created by passage in cell culture.","Jackwood, D J; Kwon, H M; Saif, L J",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,169,1

We carried out a cost-minimization analysis to compare the two treatment alternatives in Germany. Under base case assumptions the treatment with SCIG is cost saving from the perspective of the German statutory health insurance. The main cost drivers are IVIG and SCIG; the incremental cost of SCIG compared to IVIG is most sensitive to changes in the immunoglobulin price and changes in the body weight of the patient.","Högy, Barbara; Keinecke, Heinz-Otto; Borte, Michael",The European journal of health economics : HEPAC : health economics in prevention and care,169,1

METHODS Patients referred for endovascular management of central venous occlusion during a 42-month period were identified from a regional endovascular database, providing prospective information on techniques and clinical outcome. Corresponding patient records, angiograms, and radiographic reports were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Sixteen patients aged 48 years (range 0.5-76), including 11 females, were included. All patients but 1 had had multiple central venous catheters with a median total indwelling time of 37 months. Eleven patients cannulated for hemodialysis had had significantly fewer individual catheters inserted compared with 5 patients cannulated for nutritional support (mean 3.6 vs. 10.2, p<0.001) before endovascular intervention. Preoperative imaging by magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) in 8 patients, computed tomography (CT) venography in 3, conventional angiography in 6, and/or ultrasonography in 8, verified 15 brachiocephalic, 13 internal jugular, 3 superior caval, and/or 3 subclavian venous occlusions. Patients were subjected to recanalization (n=2), recanalization and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (n=5), or stenting for vena cava superior syndrome (n=1) prior to catheter insertion. The remaining 8 patients were cannulated by avoiding the occluded route. CONCLUSIONS Central venous occlusion occurs particularly in patients under hemodialysis and with a history of multiple central venous catheterizations with large-diameter catheters and/or long total indwelling time periods. Patients with central venous occlusion verified by CT or MRT venography and need for central venous access should be referred for endovascular intervention.","Pikwer, Andreas; Acosta, Stefan; Kölbel, Tilo; Åkeson, Jonas",The journal of vascular access,169,1

However, the pathogenesis and medical treatment of PMs remain largely unelucidated. METHODS Laparoscopically-induced PM xenografted mouse model was conducted by xenografting human uterine myoma fragments into the abdominal cavity of SCID mice and hormonal manipulation was performed using this mouse model to demonstrate the role of oestrogen in the development of implanted PMs. Immunohistochemistry of oestrogen receptor α (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR), vimentin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), microvessel density (MVD) and Ki-67 index was performed and compared. RESULTS In the patient with PMs, ERα, PR, angiogenesis and proliferative property expression were upregulated in PM lesions compared to uterine myomas. In the laparoscopically-induced PM mouse model, implanted myomas had more steroid receptor expressions, angiogenesis and proliferative property compared with pre-xenografted or non-implanted myoma. Depletion of oestrogen in the ovariectomized (OVX) mice decreased laparoscopically-induced PM implantations. In comparison, the implantations of PMs were increased with additional E2 supplement. Hormonal manipulation in the PM mouse model, including AI, GnRHa and SERM groups, were compared and AI significantly decreased the implantations, steroid receptor, angiogenesis, cell density, and proliferative index of PMs compared with control group. Furthermore, GnRHa significantly decreased VEGF and MVD expressions compared with control group. CONCLUSIONS These data highlight the crucial role of oestrogen in the development of laparoscopically-induced PMs and suggest that hormone manipulation may be a potential therapeutic agent.

Our previous studies have shown that a candidate SARS vaccine antigen consisting of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV spike protein can induce potent neutralizing antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV challenge in vaccinated animals. To optimize expression conditions for scale-up production of the RBD vaccine candidate, we hypothesized that this could be potentially achieved by removing glycosylation sites in the RBD protein. In this study, we constructed two RBD protein variants: 1) RBD193-WT (193-aa, residues 318-510) and its deglycosylated forms (RBD193-N1, RBD193-N2, RBD193-N3); 2) RBD219-WT (219-aa, residues 318-536) and its deglycosylated forms (RBD219-N1, RBD219-N2, and RBD219-N3). All constructs were expressed as recombinant proteins in yeast. The purified recombinant proteins of these constructs were compared for their antigenicity, functionality and immunogenicity in mice using alum as the adjuvant. We found that RBD219-N1 exhibited high expression yield, and maintained its antigenicity and functionality. More importantly, RBD219-N1 induced significantly stronger RBD-specific antibody responses and a higher level of neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice than RBD193-WT, RBD193-N1, RBD193-N3, or RBD219-WT. These results suggest that RBD219-N1 could be selected as an optimal SARS vaccine candidate for further development.","Chen, Wen-Hsiang; Du, Lanying; Chag, Shivali M; Ma, Cuiqing; Tricoche, Nancy; Tao, Xinrong; Seid, Christopher A; Hudspeth, Elissa M; Lustigman, Sara; Tseng, Chien-Te K; Bottazzi, Maria Elena; Hotez, Peter J; Zhan, Bin; Jiang, Shibo",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,169,16

Here, we report that neither the transmembrane domain nor the short lumenal domain of IBV E is required for Golgi targeting. However, an N-terminal truncation containing only the cytoplasmic domain (CTE) was efficiently localized to the Golgi complex, and this domain could retain a reporter protein in the Golgi. Thus, the cytoplasmic tail of the E protein is necessary and sufficient for Golgi targeting. The IBV E protein is palmitoylated on one or two cysteine residues adjacent to its transmembrane domain, but palmitoylation was not required for proper Golgi targeting. Using C-terminal truncations, we determined that the IBV E Golgi targeting information is present between tail amino acids 13 and 63. Upon treatment with brefeldin A, both the E and CTE proteins redistributed to punctate structures that colocalized with the Golgi matrix proteins GM130 and p115 instead of being localized to the endoplasmic reticulum like Golgi glycosylation enzymes.

Of 38 specimens, 30 were collected from symptomatic infants and 8 were collected when respiratory symptoms were absent. Overall, one or more respiratory viruses were detected in 94.7% (36/38) of the specimens. Of the 36 PCR-positive specimens, 77.8% (28/36) were positive for more than one virus. Most of these co-infections were double infections (55.6% or 20/36). Of note, co-infections with 4 and 3 viruses were observed in 3 (8.3% or 3/36) and 5 (13.9% or 5/36) specimens, respectively. Of the 8 specimens collected from the 4 infants when apparent respiratory symptoms were absent, 7 (87.5%) were positive for respiratory viruses. Respiratory viral co-infections were also frequent and found in 5 of the specimens (62.5%). However, apparent correlation between disease severity and co-infection was undetectable due to the limit of the number of cases studied. Taken together, this longitudinal study revealed that respiratory viral co-infections were not infrequent in infants aged 0-2 years, regardless of the presence of respiratory symptoms (62.5-77.8%).","Kawabuchi-Kurata, Takako; Misaki, Takako; Suehiro, Yutaka; Komano, Atsushi Jun; Kase, Tetsuo; Takahashi, Kazuo",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,169,32

Univariate analysis was used to assess the success rate of LT placement beyond the duodenojejunal flexure, time required for the procedure, clinical outcomes, and adverse events.The success rate was 100% in both groups. Procedure time was numerically, but not statistically, shorter in the NEWSt group compared with the endoscopy group (24 ± 13 vs 30 ± 13 min; P = 0.174). There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of surgery rate (31% vs 12%; P = 0.225), fasting period (11.3 ± 6.3 vs 9.9 ± 4.5 days; P = 0.482), hospital stay (26.4 ± 22.1 vs 18.7 ± 7.0 days; P = 0.194), and recurrence rate (19% vs 24%; P = 1.0).

METHODS Following the nature of SARS epidemics, an epidemic model of SARS based on SEIR model of infectious disease was built, in which case management group was set up and some parameters related to control measures were included. As an example, data gathered from Beijing was fitted to illustrate its application to quantitatively evaluate the intervention measures. RESULTS In the newly developed model of epidemics, parameters related to control measures could easily be modified. When scenario assumption was used, a model on SARS outbreak under various circumstances of intervention measures could be set. Thus, quantitative evaluation of intervention measures could perfectly be caried out. Pilot study revealed that the fitness existed in modeling the outbreak of SARS in Beijing and the intervention measures implemented around April 20, 2003, had major contribution to the control of SARS. CONCLUSION The model of SARS epidemics seemed to be stable and reliable to be used to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention measures implemented during the SARS outbreak in a quantitative way.","Cai, Quan-cai; Jiang, Qing-wu; Xu, Qin-feng; Cheng, Xiang; Guo, Qiang; Sun, Qing-wen; Zhao, Gen-ming",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,169,33

It is predominantly seen in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on chronic dialysis. There is no definitive standard of care for calciphylaxis, and the overall prognosis for patients, particularly those with ulcerated lesions, is bleak. One important role of wound care clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic is to ensure that the continuity of care of an at-risk population is maintained while limiting the patient's potential exposure to the virus. Innovative therapies paired with alternative treatment sites of service are one such method. CASE REPORT A 56-year-old female with ESRD on at-home peritoneal dialysis (PD) presented to the outpatient wound clinic with a punch biopsy-proven calciphylaxis lesion. Within days, state-wide ""shelter-at-home"" orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic went into effect. To prevent disruption in care and to minimize risk to the patient, the lesion was treated with bi-weekly self-application of a continuous topical oxygen therapy (cTOT) device paired with weekly telemedicine visits. The wound completely resolved after 9 weeks of topical oxygen therapy with no complications or device malfunctions. CONCLUSIONS This case, to the authors' knowledge, is the first to document healing in a calciphylaxis wound with the use of cTOT. Topical oxygen therapy may be a beneficial adjunctive therapy in the treatment of wounds caused by calciphylaxis. Finding creative ways to navigate this current health care crisis is essential to help mitigate risk for vulnerable patients with advanced comorbidities.","Cole, Windy; Yoder, Courtney M; Coe, Stacey",Wounds : a compendium of clinical research and practice,169,22

We review general ethical frameworks and relevant vocabulary for infection control practitioners and hospital epidemiologists. Frameworks for the ethics of infection control resemble those of public health more than those of clinical medicine but embrace elements of both. The optimum framework, we suggest, takes into account a virtue-based communitarianism. The virtue ethics movement stresses the need to consider not only rules and outcomes but also the character of the individual(s) involved. Communitarianism emphasizes the well-being and values of local communities, best determined by shared, democratic decision making among stakeholders.

RESULTS There were 6280 valid questionnaires gathered. In order to control and prevent SARS, strict management was conducted in three universities which providing various social supports. Out of the 6280 students, 460 had SCL-90 positive symptoms with a rate of 7.3%. Risk factors of SCL-90 positive symptom were found as follows: major in arts (OR = 2.00), misconception on the control and prevention of SARS (OR = 1.91), considering measures non-effective (OR = 2.25), and do not believe that SARS can be under control (OR = 3.57). Protective factors of SCL-90 positive symptom would include as: being female (OR = 0.77), being graduate students (OR = 0.38), and being not much influenced on study and daily life during the period of strict management (OR = 0.54).

We conducted a multicenter evaluation of kidney biopsy findings in living patients to identify various kidney disease pathology findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We identified 14 native and 3 transplant kidney biopsies performed for cause in patients with documented recent or concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection treated at 7 large hospital systems in the United States. OBSERVATIONS: Men and women were equally represented in this case series, with a higher proportion of Black (n=8) and Hispanic (n=5) patients. All 17 patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, but only 3 presented with severe COVID-19 symptoms. Acute kidney injury (n=15) and proteinuria (n=11) were the most common indications for biopsy and these symptoms developed concurrently or within 1 week of COVID-19 symptoms in all patients. Acute tubular injury (n=14), collapsing glomerulopathy (n=7), and endothelial injury/thrombotic microangiopathy (n=6) were the most common histologic findings. 2 of the 3 transplant recipients developed active antibody-mediated rejection weeks after COVID-19. 8 patients required dialysis, but others improved with conservative management. LIMITATIONS: Small study size and short clinical follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Cases of even symptomatically mild COVID-19 were accompanied by acute kidney injury and/or heavy proteinuria that prompted a diagnostic kidney biopsy. Although acute tubular injury was seen among most of them, uncommon pathology such as collapsing glomerulopathy and acute endothelial injury were detected, and most of these patients progressed to irreversible kidney injury and dialysis.","Akilesh, Shreeram; Nast, Cynthia C; Yamashita, Michifumi; Henriksen, Kammi; Charu, Vivek; Troxell, Megan L; Kambham, Neeraja; Bracamonte, Erika; Houghton, Donald; Ahmed, Naila I; Chong, Chyi Chyi; Thajudeen, Bijin; Rehman, Shehzad; Khoury, Firas; Zuckerman, Jonathan E; Gitomer, Jeremy; Raguram, Parthassarathy C; Mujeeb, Shanza; Schwarze, Ulrike; Shannon, M Brendan; De Castro, Iris; Alpers, Charles E; Najafian, Behzad; Nicosia, Roberto F; Andeen, Nicole K; Smith, Kelly D",Am J Kidney Dis,169,16

Currently, over 15,000 SARS-CoV-2 single mutations have been recorded, which have a great impact on the development of diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapies, and drugs. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2's evolutionary characteristics and general trend. In this work, we present a comprehensive genotyping analysis of existing SARS-CoV-2 mutations. We reveal that host immune response via APOBEC and ADAR gene editing gives rise to near 65% of recorded mutations. Additionally, we show that children under age five and the elderly may be at high risk from COVID-19 because of their overreaction to the viral infection. Moreover, we uncover that populations of Oceania and Africa react significantly more intensively to SARS-CoV-2 infection than those of Europe and Asia, which may explain why African Americans were shown to be at increased risk of dying from COVID-19, in addition to their high risk of COVID-19 infection caused by systemic health and social inequities. Finally, our study indicates that for two viral genome sequences of the same origin, their evolution order may be determined from the ratio of mutation type, C > T over T > C.","Wang, Rui; Hozumi, Yuta; Zheng, Yong-Hui; Yin, Changchuan; Wei, Guo-Wei",Viruses,169,13

However, the safety and efficacy of extending the window for intervention remains to be definitively established. CASE REPORT A healthy 26-year-old woman presented with headache, left-sided hemiplegia, and rightward gaze palsy 2 days after a minor trauma. Time last known well was approximately 50 hours prior to presentation. Computed tomography angiography revealed dissection of the distal right internal carotid artery and occlusion of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a small area of acute infarct in the right basal ganglia and right insular cortex, but suggested a large ischemic penumbra; this was confirmed with cerebral perfusion analysis. In light of the patient's young age and potential for penumbral salvage, mechanical thrombectomy of an M1 thrombus and stenting of an internal carotid artery dissection were performed nearly 60 hours after the onset of symptoms. The patient demonstrated marked clinical improvement over the following days and was discharged home in excellent condition one week after presentation. Based on our clinical experience and other emerging data, we propose that extension of the 24-hour window for endovascular intervention may improve functional outcomes among select individuals. CONCLUSIONS A 24-hour window for endovascular thrombectomy is appropriate for many patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke. However, in select individuals, extension of the window to 48 hours or beyond may improve functional outcomes.","Beutler, Bryce D; Rangaswamy, Rajesh; King, Richard D; Tabaac, Burton J",Am J Case Rep,169,29

METHODS: The participants were recruited from a Chinese university (n = 195; 58.5% females). The first three-wave surveys were conducted before COVID-19 (during December of Year 1, June of Year 1, and December of Year 2 of their college study; Time 1, Time 2, Time 3), while the fourth survey (Time 4; during June of Year 2 of their college study) was conducted in June 2020 during COVID-19. COVID-19-related factors, including quarantine, lockdown, boredom, emotional loneliness, and social loneliness, were investigated. RESULTS: The results showed a significant increase in the levels of depressive symptoms and prevalence of probable depression during COVID-19 (69.2%) compared to those 18 months, 12 months and 6 months before COVID-19 (41.5, 45.6, 48.2%) but non-significant changes in SPA. Boredom and emotional loneliness were positively associated with both SPA and depressive symptoms during COVID-19. Social loneliness was also positively associated with depressive symptoms during COVID-19. Quarantine and lockdown were not significantly associated with SPA or depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight that the study population may be a high risk group of probable depression. Future studies should continue to track these mental and behavioral status with the progression of the epidemic. The identified emotional factors could be used to reduce depressive symptoms during COVID-19 and prevent the potential risk of SPA.","Yang, Xue; Hu, Huahua; Zhao, Chengjia; Xu, Huihui; Tu, Xiaolian; Zhang, Guohua",BMC Psychiatry,169,14

Cancer comorbidity seems to have no direct relationship with severe events, and the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine may be effective in the prevention and treatment of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NICP).","Zeng, Yong; Zhang, Bo; Zhang, Xufeng; Yi, Cunjian",Chin.

However, interventions developed to expand MOUD access have limited ability to engage opioid users at higher levels of overdose risk, such as those who inject opioids. This paper describes the study protocol for testing STAMINA (Syringe Service Telemedicine Access for Medication-assisted Intervention through NAvigation), an intervention that engages high-risk opioid users at community-based syringe service programs (SSP) and quickly links them to MOUD using a telemedicine platform. METHODS: This randomized control trial will be conducted at three SSP sites in Chicago. All participants will complete an initial assessment with a provider from a Federally Qualified Health Center who can prescribe or refer MOUD services as appropriate. The control arm will receive standard referral to treatment and the intervention arm will receive immediate telemedicine linkage to the provider and (depending on the type of MOUD prescribed) provided transportation to pick up their induction prescription (for buprenorphine or naltrexone) or attend their intake appointment (for methadone). We aim to recruit a total of 273 participants over two years to provide enough power to detect a difference in our primary outcome of MOUD treatment linkage. Secondary outcomes include treatment engagement, treatment retention, and non-MOUD opioid use. Data will be collected using structured interviews and saliva drug tests delivered at baseline, three months, and six months. Fixed and mixed effects generalized linear regression analyses and survival analysis will be conducted to compare the probabilities of a successful treatment linkage between the two arms, days retained in treatment, and post-baseline opioid and other drug use. DISCUSSION: If successful, STAMINA's telemedicine approach will significantly reduce the amount of time between SSP clients' initial indication of interest in the medication and treatment initiation. Facilitating this process will likely lead to stronger additional treatment- and recovery-oriented outcomes. This study is also timely given the need for more rigorous testing of telemedicine interventions in light of temporary regulatory changes that have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The aim of our study is to compare the results between AP patients with and without COVID-19, and to reveal the effects of COVID-19 on the course, intensive care needs and mortality of AP patients. MATERIAL METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective and observational study. Patients over 18 years of age, who were diagnosed with AP during the current pandemic. According to the RT-PCR test result, patients were divided into two groups: COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative. Gender, age, laboratory parameters, intensive care unit admission, length of hospital stay, severity and mortality of AP were compared between these two groups. RESULTS: We reviewed 562 patients presenting to the emergency department who were diagnosed with acute pancreatitis between 10.03.2020 and 31.12.2020 and included 189 patients in our study. Positive patients need for intensive care (7.23%) were higher compared to negative patients (0.94%). 32.53% of positive patients and 14.15% of negative patients had severe AP (p < 0.03). We established that being COVID-19 positive, CCI scores of &#8805;5, presence of COVID-19 compatible pneumonia on CT and BISAP scores had an effect on mortality (p < 0,05). CONCLUSION: The severity and mortality of AP increase in patients with both AP and COVID-19. This rate increases even more in the presence of COVID-19-associated pneumonia. We believe that new strategies should be developed for the follow-up and treatment of patients with both these conditions.","Karaali, Rezan; Topal, Firdes",Am J Emerg Med,169,24

Their work was inspired by the most popular traditional loteria set Don Clemente Gallo, created by Don Clemente Jacques in 1913. Social semiotics was employed in the analysis of the images and text in the two COVID-19 artistic renderings with the objective of discovering the similarities and differences between the artists' works, and the messages they sought to convey. The analysis also attempted to uncover how the artists expressed their Mexican-American identity and connected with their audience. The results reveal the use of English and Spanish in both works, and a focus on the medical and social aspects of the pandemic and mandatory quarantine. Additionally, both loteria sets incorporated linguistic and cultural elements connected to the artists' Mexican-American heritage. The works differ in the way in which they were organized, the use of Spanish and English, and the medical and social topics included. The overall analysis shows that, through a variety of semiotic resources, both artists were able to reflect the different emotions brought about by the COVID-19 situation and to establish a connection with Mexican-American audiences.","Zapata, G.

The aim of this study was to analyze and report the data of transferred refractory ARDS patients managed with venovenous (VV) ECMO at a national referral center over the last 11 years. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Referral center in Italy. PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised 100 patients treated from May 2009-November 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean age was 54 ± 14 years, and 65% of patients were male. Patients were treated throughout the year, with seasonal peaks in the winter months. The majority of patients were referred from hospitals within the Lombardia region (81%), mainly from the city of Milan and surrounding area (36% of the total). The most common etiology of refractory ARDS was H1N1 influenza A (42 patients [42%]), followed by bacterial pneumonia (35 patients [35%]), and severe acute respiratory syndrome due to Sars-CoV-2 infection (five patients [5%]). All patients were severely hypoxic at the time of VV ECMO treatment. No transport-related complication was recorded. The most common configuration used in the authors' clinical practice was a bicaval dual-lumen configuration (61 patients [61%]), followed by a femoro-jugular configuration (38 patients [38%]). The intensive care unit survival rate was 55%. CONCLUSIONS: Referral to a specialized center for VV ECMO treatment should be considered expeditiously in case of refractory ARDS, which often is lethal. Transport of patients with an unstable condition, although challenging, is feasible, and centralization of patient care is associated with good outcomes.","Pieri, Marina; Vettorello, Francesco; Calabrò, Maria Grazia; Zangrillo, Alberto; Scandroglio, Anna Mara",J. cardiothoracic vasc. anest,169,25

I-FABP concentrations in these two populations were significantly lower than in patients with abdominal pain without COVID-19 [344.8 pg/mL (268.9-579.6)]. I-FABP was neither associated with severity nor the duration of symptoms. I-FABP was correlated with polymorphonuclear cell counts. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, we observed a low I-FABP concentration in COVID-19 patients either with or without gastrointestinal symptoms, of which the pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical impact remain to be established. Further explorations on a larger cohort of patients will be needed to unravel the molecular mechanism of such observation, including the effects of malabsorption and/or abnormal lipid metabolism.","Guedj, Kevin; Uzzan, Mathieu; Soudan, Damien; Trichet, Catherine; Nicoletti, Antonino; Weiss, Emmanuel; Manceau, Hana; Nuzzo, Alexandre; Corcos, Olivier; Treton, Xavier; Peoc039,; h, Katell",PLoS One,169,1

Using detailed epidemiological and mobility data available for New York City and comprehensive modelling accounting for under-detection, we reconstruct the COVID-19 transmission dynamics therein during the 2020 spring pandemic wave and estimate the effectiveness of two major non-pharmaceutical interventions-lockdown-like measures that reduce contact rates and universal masking. Lockdown-like measures were associated with greater than 50% transmission reduction for all age groups. Universal masking was associated with an approximately 7% transmission reduction overall and up to 20% reduction for 65+ year olds during the first month of implementation. This result suggests that face covering can substantially reduce transmission when lockdown-like measures are lifted but by itself may be insufficient to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Overall, findings support the need to implement multiple interventions simultaneously to effectively mitigate COVID-19 spread before the majority of population can be protected through mass-vaccination.","Yang, Wan; Shaff, Jaimie; Shaman, Jeffrey",J R Soc Interface,169,24

Several mechanisms regulate the cellular response to oxygen including the prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD)/factor inhibiting HIF (FIH)-hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway, cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol) dioxygenase (ADO) system, and the lysine-specific demethylases (KDM) 5A and KDM6A. Using a systems-based approach we discuss the literature on oxygen sensing pathways in the context of virus replication in different tissues that experience variable oxygen tension. Current information supports a model where the PHD-HIF pathway enhances the replication of viruses infecting tissues under low oxygen, however, the reverse is true for viruses with a selective tropism for higher oxygen environments. Differences in oxygen tension and associated HIF signaling may play an important role in viral tropism and pathogenesis. Thus, pharmaceutical agents that modulate HIF activity could provide novel treatment options for viral infections and associated pathological conditions.","Liu, Peter Jianrui; Balfe, Peter; McKeating, Jane A; Schilling, Mirjam",Viruses,169,16

PURPOSE: A case of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) occurring as a reaction to ustekinumab therapy is reported. SUMMARY: After starting ustekinumab for treatment of psoriatric arthritis, a 46-year-old female presented with flu-like symptoms and cough with blood-tinged sputum that had begun 1 week previously. Her initial computed tomography scan of the chest demonstrated bilateral ground-glass opacities. On bronchoscopy, the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) return became bloodier from sample 1 to samples 2 and 3. Her BAL fluid was more than 90% hemosiderin-laden macrophages, a finding consistent with DAH. We ruled out infectious etiologies and other common vasculitis conditions that can cause DAH. A diagnosis of ustekinumab-induced DAH was made due to a temporal relationship between initiation of the drug and the patient's presentation and the absence of infection and other alternate diagnosis. Prior case reports including ustekinumab-induced pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease with a granulomatous component, and lupus syndrome have been reported, with this being the first case of DAH in a patient undergoing treatment of psoriatic arthritis. CONCLUSION: A 46-year-old woman developed DAH during ustekinumab treatment. Symptoms abated after drug discontinuation and supportive treament. Clinicians must remain mindful of this rare complication of ustekinumab use in order to avoid potential delays in appropriate DAH treatment.","Gunasekaran, Kulothungan; Shukla, Anant; Palanisamy, Nageshwari; Singh Rahi, Mandeep; Wolff, Armand",Am. j. health system pharm,169,20

Currently, RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus is mainly detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based nucleic acid assays, while SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody are identified by immunological assays. Both nucleic acid assays and immunological assays rely on the luminescence signals of specific luminescence probes for qualitative and quantitative detection. The exploration of novel luminescence probes will play a crucial role in improving the detection sensitivity of the assays. As innate probes, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) exhibit negligible luminescence in the free state but enhanced luminescence in the aggregated or restricted states. Moreover, AIEgen-based nanoparticles (AIE dots) offer efficient luminescence, good biocompatibility and water solubility, and superior photostability. Both AIEgens and AIE dots have been widely used for high-performance detection of biomolecules and small molecules, chemical/biological imaging, and medical therapeutics. In this review, the availability of AIEgens and AIE dots in nucleic acid assays and immunological assays are enumerated and discussed. By building a bridge between AIE materials and COVID-19, we hope to inspire researchers to use AIE materials as a powerful weapon against COVID-19.","Liu, Zongwei; Meng, Ting; Tang, Xiaofang; Tian, Ran; Guan, Weijiang",Front Immunol,169,26

Thus, it is important to assess FMS so that children needing additional support can be identified in a timely fashion. There is great potential for universal screening of FMS in schools, but research has established that current assessment tools are not fit for purpose. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate the psychometric properties of a FMS assessment tool designed specifically to meet the demands of universal screening in schools. METHODS: A working group consisting of academics from developmental psychology, public health and behavioural epidemiology developed an assessment tool (FUNMOVES) based on theory and prior evidence. Over three studies, 814 children aged 4 to 11 years were assessed in school using FUNMOVES. Rasch analysis was used to evaluate structural validity and modifications were then made to FUNMOVES activities after each study based on Rasch results and implementation fidelity. RESULTS: The initial Rasch analysis found numerous psychometric problems including multidimensionality, disordered thresholds, local dependency, and misfitting items. Study 2 showed a unidimensional measure, with acceptable internal consistency and no local dependency, but that did not fit the Rasch model. Performance on a jumping task was misfitting, and there were issues with disordered thresholds (for jumping, hopping and balance tasks). Study 3 revealed a unidimensional assessment tool with good fit to the Rasch model, and no further issues, once jumping and hopping scoring were modified. IMPLICATIONS: The finalised version of FUNMOVES (after three iterations) meets standards for accurate measurement, is free and able to assess a whole class in under an hour using resources available in schools. Thus FUNMOVES has the potential to allow schools to efficiently screen FMS to ensure that targeted support can be provided and disability barriers removed.","Eddy, Lucy H; Preston, Nick; Mon-Williams, Mark; Bingham, Daniel D; Atkinson, Jo M C; Ellingham-Khan, Marsha; Otteslev, Ava; Hill, Liam J B",PLoS One,169,3

Therefore, it is paramount to identify the views of the community regarding how to allocate such resources. This study aims to quantify Australian community preferences for ventilation allocation. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was designed and administrated to an adult Australian online panel. Each survey respondent answered 12 choice sets from a total design of 120. Each choice set placed the respondent in the role of hypothetical decision maker, prioritising care between two patients. Conditional logit, mixed logit regression and latent class analysis were used to analyse the data. Additionally, we asked a series of attitudinal questions about different methods of making such decisions in practice, focusing on who should be responsible. RESULTS: A total of 1050 community members completed the survey and responded to each choice. Dimensions considered most important were age, likely effectiveness, smoking status, whether the person has dependents, whether they are a healthcare worker, and whether they have a disability or not. Estimating marginal rates of substitution between patient characteristics and chance of survival if ventilated yielded values of up to 30 percentage points if the patient was 70 years old relative to being 30. However, respondents typically said they would prefer such decisions to be made by medical professionals. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the preferences of the community to allocation of ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of such information should be treated with some caution as the underlying reason for such preferences are unclear, and respondents themselves preferred the decision to be made by others.","Norman, Richard; Robinson, Suzanne; Dickinson, Helen; Williams, Iestyn; Meshcheriakova, Elena; Manipis, Kathleen; Anstey, Matthew",Patient,169,32
260527,260527,260527,Cracking the cell access code for the deadly virus VEEV,12.168311,5.9555883,2020,"A series of cases with rare thromboembolic incidents including cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (some of them fatal) and concomitant thrombocytopenia occurring shortly after vaccination with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine AZD1222 (Vaxzevria) have caused significant concern and led to its temporary suspension in many countries. Immediate laboratory efforts in four of these patients have identified a tentative pathomechanism underlying this syndrome termed initially vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) and renamed recently vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). It encompasses the presence of platelet-activating antibodies to platelet factor-4/heparin complexes, possibly emulated by polyanionic constituents of AZD1222, and thus resembles heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Because these immune complexes bind and activate platelets via FcÎ³ receptor IIA (FcÎ³RIIA), high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin G has been suggested for treatment of VITT in addition to non-heparin anticoagulants. Here we propose inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) approved for B cell malignancies (e.g., ibrutinib) as another therapeutic option in VITT, as they are expected to pleiotropically target multiple pathways downstream of FcÎ³RIIA-mediated Btk activation, for example, as demonstrated for the effective inhibition of platelet aggregation, dense granule secretion, P-selectin expression and platelet-neutrophil aggregate formation stimulated by FcÎ³RIIA cross-linking. Moreover, C-type lectin-like receptor CLEC-2- and GPIb-mediated platelet activation, the interactions and activation of monocytes and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps, as encountered in HIT, could be attenuated by Btk inhibitors. As a paradigm for emergency repurposing of approved drugs in COVID-19, off-label use of Btk inhibitors in a low-dose range not affecting haemostatic functions could thus be considered a sufficiently safe option to treat VITT.","von Hundelshausen, Philipp; Lorenz, Reinhard; Siess, Wolfgang; Weber, Christian",Thromb. haemost,169,24

Case-finding methods: We report a patient from Panama with SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated by ATM and present a comprehensive clinical review of 43 patients with COVID-19-associated ATM from 21 countries published from March 2020 to January 2021. In addition, 3 cases of ATM were reported as serious adverse events during the clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222). Results: All patients had typical features of ATM with acute onset of paralysis, sensory level and sphincter deficits due to spinal cord lesions demonstrated by imaging. There were 23 males (53%) and 20 females (47%) ranging from ages 21- to 73- years-old (mean age, 49 years), with two peaks at 29 and 58 years, excluding 3 pediatric cases. The main clinical manifestations were quadriplegia (58%) and paraplegia (42%). MRI reports were available in 40 patients; localized ATM lesions affected &#8804;3 cord segments (12 cases, 30%) at cervical (5 cases) and thoracic cord levels (7 cases); 28 cases (70%) had longitudinally-extensive ATM (LEATM) involving &#8805;4 spinal cord segments (cervicothoracic in 18 cases and thoracolumbar-sacral in 10 patients). Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) occurred in 8 patients, mainly women (67%) ranging from 27- to 64-years-old. Three ATM patients also had blindness from myeloneuritis optica (MNO) and two more also had acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). Conclusions: We found ATM to be an unexpectedly frequent neurological complication of COVID-19. Most cases (68%) had a latency of 10 days to 6 weeks that may indicate post-infectious neurological complications mediated by the host's response to the virus. In 32% a brief latency (15 hours to 5 days) suggested a direct neurotropic effect of SARS-CoV-2. The occurrence of 3 reported ATM adverse effects among 11,636 participants in the AZD1222 vaccine trials is extremely high considering a worldwide incidence of 0.5/million COVID-19-associated ATM cases found in this report. The pathogenesis of ATM remains unknown, but it is conceivable that SARS-CoV-2 antigens -perhaps also present in the AZD1222 COVID-19 vaccine or its chimpanzee adenovirus adjuvant- may induce immune mechanisms leading to the myelitis.","Román, Gustavo C; Gracia, Fernando; Torres, Antonio; Palacios, Alexis; Gracia, Karla; Harris, Diógenes",Front Immunol,169,1

Recently special attention has been paid to the relationship of the WT1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs16754 with AML risk and outcome, but the conflicting results made it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. In the present study, we systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of existing evidence. We searched Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science, Medline, Cochrane Library, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases using predefined search methodology for relevant studies. We pooled odd ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) to evaluate the association between SNP rs16754 and AML risk. In addition, we analyzed hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI for overall survive, relapse-free survival, and disease-free survival. Q-statistic was used to assess the homogeneity and Egger test was used to evaluate publication bias. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria for analysis. The results of fixed-effect meta-analyses revealed no association between SNP rs16754 and AML risk (AA + GA vs GG: ORâ=â0.92, 95% CI: 0.71-1.19, Pâ=â.518; AA vs GA + GG: ORâ=â1.23, 95% CI: 0.86-1.76, Pâ=â.262; AA vs GG: ORâ=â1.05, 95% CI: 0.68-1.63, Pâ=â.820; AG vs AA: ORâ=â0.77, 95% CI: 0.53-1.13, Pâ=â.186; AG vs GG: ORâ=â0.89, 95% CI: 0.68-1.16, Pâ=â.376). In subgroup analysis by race, age, and disease type, we did not find any significant association. However, the presence of rs16754 GA/GG genotype was associated with improved overall survive (HRâ=â0.48, 95% CI: 0.26-0.91, Pâ=â.024) and relapse-free survival (HRâ=â0.82, 95% CI: 0.68-1.00, Pâ=â.048) compared with the rs16754 AA. In summary, the WT1 SNP rs16754 was not associated with AML risk, but it had a significant impact on clinical outcome in AML patients.","Yu, Xin; Zhang, Yuan; Liu, Shuang; Mu, Yu; Shang, Fengjia; Zhang, Nan",Medicine (Baltimore),169,24

This study aims at evaluating antibiotic prescribing during COVID-19 pandemic from November 2019 to December 2020. Materials and Methods: A systematic review was conducted primarily through the NCBI database, using PRISMA guidelines to identify relevant literature for the period between November 1, 2019 and December 19, 2020, using the keywords: COVID-19 OR SARS-Cov-2 AND antibiotics restricted to the English language excluding nonclinical articles. Five hundred twenty-seven titles were identified; all articles fulfilling the study criteria were included, 133 through the NCBI, and 8 through Google Scholar with a combined total of 141 studies. The patient's spectrum included all ages from neonates to elderly with all associated comorbidities, including immune suppression. Results: Of 28,093 patients included in the combined studies, 58.7% received antibiotics (16,490/28,093), ranging from 1.3% to 100% coverage. Antibiotics coverage was less in children (57%) than in adults with comorbidities (75%). Broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed presumptively without pathogen identifications, which might contribute to adverse outcomes. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant and wide range of antibiotic prescribing in patients affected by the disease, particularly in adults with underlying comorbidities, despite the paucity of evidence of associated bacterial infections. The current practice might increase patients' immediate and long-term risks of adverse events, susceptibility to secondary infections as well as aggravating AMR.","Al-Hadidi, Sara H; Alhussain, Hashim; Abdel Hadi, Hamad; Johar, Alreem; Yassine, Hadi M; Al Thani, Asmaa A; Eltai, Nahla O",Microb. drug resist.

Among these, epidemics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), H1N1 influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome corona virus (MERS-Co V) emerged as very important issues during last three decades as these infections caused quite large number of human deaths worldwide. Coronaviruses are single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses which mainly in past were considered responsible for high percentage of (around 30%) of common cold/flu cases. Viruses causing SARS, MERS and COVID-19 are members of family Coronavirdae. World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the novel Cov-19 virus infection was first diagnosed in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China during December 2019. Initially the virus was named as nCoV-19 and later disease due to this virus was named as COVID-19, and recently named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. This new coronavirus was found to have 86.9 % homology to a bat corona virus and hence it was suspected to have been originated from bats. Till 15th January 2021, the COVID-19 infection has been reported from 219 countries. It has caused over 20 million deaths in humans around the globe. Countries reporting very high death/infection rates include USA (393,948/23,617,815), Brazil (206,009/5,257,459), Mexico (136,917/1,571,901), India (153,000/10,596,442), UK (84,767/3,211,576), France (69,031/2,830,842), Russia (63,940/3,495,816) and Italy (80,326/2,319,036). Worldwide a total of over 96,750,700 COVID-19 cases have so far been reported. As reported earlier this pandemic has hit almost every country worldwide causing exceptionally high morbidity and mortality. Amongst the South Asian countries India is worst hit by this deadly COVID-19. Pakistan?s neighboring Iran is also very badly infected and reported 57,057 deaths of 1,348,316 infected people.

The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for data scientists to model COVID-19, when the epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 are yet to be fully explained. The uncertainty around the COVID-19 with no vaccine and effective medicine available until today create additional pressure on the epidemiologists and policy makers. In such a crucial situation, it is very important to predict infected cases to support prevention of the disease and aid in the preparation of healthcare service. In this paper, we have tried to understand the spreading capability of COVID-19 in India taking into account of the lockdown period. The numbers of confirmed cases are increased in India and states in the past few weeks. A differential equation based simple model has been used to understand the pattern of COVID-19 in India and some states. Our findings suggest that the physical distancing and lockdown strategies implemented in India are successfully reducing the spread and that the tempo of pandemic growth has slowed in recent days.","Singh, Brijesh P; Singh, Gunjan",J Public Aff,169,16

Willing to contribute with this fight to defeat COVID-19, we performed a virtual screening study on a library containing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs, in a search for molecules capable of hitting three main molecular targets of SARS-CoV-2 currently available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Our results were refined with further molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and MM-PBSA calculations and pointed to 7 multi-target hits which we propose here for experimental evaluation and repurposing as potential drugs against COVID-19. Additional rounds of docking, MD simulations and MM-PBSA calculations with remdesivir suggested that this compound can also work as a multi-target drug against SARS-CoV-2.

The aim of this systematic review was to gather all possible cardiovascular manifestations of the coronavirus family in the literature. Adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane and ProQuest which were updated on May 1, 2020 for the last time. Regarding to the novelty and speed of publications on COVID-19, we searched Google Scholar and also references of included studies and review articles in the systematic search results were searched manually. The searched keywords were the combination of the following MeSH terms: ""COVID-19"", ""SARS"", ""MERS""and ""cardiovascular presentation"". The systematic review was registered with ID CRD42020180736 in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). After screening, 28 original articles and ten case studies (five case reports and five case series) were included. Most of the studies were focused on COVID-19 (20 original articles and five case studies) while the only studies about Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was a case report. Almost all the cardiovascular presentations and complications including acute cardiac injury, arrhythmias and the thrombotic complications were more prevalent in COVID-19 than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and MERS. The cardiac injury was the most common cardiovascular presentation and complication in COVID-19 whereas thrombotic complications were commonly reported in SARS. The cardiac injury was the predictor of disease severity and mortality in both COVID-19 and SARS. Coronavirus 2019 may present with cardiovascular manifestations and complications in signs and symptoms, laboratory data and other paraclinical findings. Also, cardiovascular complications in the course of COVID-19 may result in worse outcomes.","Ramandi, M. M. A.; Yarmohammadi, H.; Beikmohammadi, S.; Fahimi, B. H.

The identification of effective laboratory biomarkers able to classify patients based on their risk is imperative in being able to guarantee prompt treatment. The analysis of recently published studies highlights the role of systemic vasculitis and cytokine mediated coagulation disorders as the principal actors of multi organ failure in patients with severe COVID-19 complications. The following biomarkers have been identified: hematological (lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)), inflammatory (C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), procalcitonin (PCT)), immunological (interleukin (IL)-6 and biochemical (D-dimer, troponin, creatine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)), especially those related to coagulation cascades in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected through the administration of paper-based and electronic questionnaires to 400 respondents out of which only 277 were found valid for analysis. Findings: The study showed that by direct relationship, the awareness and knowledge of Islamic social finance instruments have a potentially significant positive contribution to poverty alleviation during the COVID-19 pandemic except for zakat that has an insignificant positive contribution. Ethical oriental has also a significant positive contribution. Contrary to expectation, the moderating effect of ethical orientation has changed zakat and waqf to have significant negative and insignificant positive contributions, respectively. Only Islamic microfinance has endured the moderating effect to continue contributing significantly and positively to the reduction of poverty. Research limitations/implications: The study explored only the potential impact of the awareness and knowledge of Islamic social finance to mitigate the extreme poverty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Practical implications: This study clearly showed the need to create enabling laws and policies to support the operations of zakat and waqf institutions to achieve their objectives effectively and efficiently. These two institutions should be integrated with Islamic microfinance for the possibility of getting better outcomes. Social implications: There should be massive campaigns to restore religious, social and political ethics to enhance the socio-economic development of Nigerians based on the principles of brotherhood.

To describe patient/parent anxiety regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection in this cohort. DESIGN: A prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: 46 centres across the UK between 16 March and 4 July 2020. A weekly online questionnaire based on the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium-WHO Case Report Form was used to collect participant reported data on symptoms, test results, National Health Service attendance, hospital admission and impact on daily life. PARTICIPANTS: 1490 immunocompromised children, defined as those requiring an annual influenza vaccination due to their underlying condition or medication. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of SARS-CoV-2-like symptoms and patient/parent anxiety score. RESULTS: Over 16 weeks during the first wave of the pandemic, no SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed in this large immunocompromised paediatric cohort (median age 11 years, 54.4% female). 110 symptomatic participants underwent a test for SARS-CoV-2; all were negative. 922 (67.4%) participants reported at least one symptom consistent with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection over the study period. 476 (34.8%) reported three or more symptoms. The most frequently reported symptoms included joint pain, fatigue, headache, nausea and muscle pain. SARS-CoV-2 testing during this period was performed on admitted patients only. 137 participants had their medication suspended or changed during the study period due to assumed COVID-19 disease risk. 62% reported high levels of anxiety (scores of 7-10 out of 10) at the start of the study, with anxiety levels remaining high throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Although symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children were common, there were no positive tests in this large immunocompromised cohort. Symptom-based screening to facilitate early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection may not be helpful in these individuals. Patient/parent anxiety about SARS-CoV-2 infection was high.

This study aimed to evaluate anxiety, depression and sleep quality in full-time teleworkers during lockdown imposed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and explore potential relationships between these variables, sociodemographic characteristics, quality of life and perceived productivity. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 143 full-time teleworkers. Participants were assessed for anxiety, depression and sleep quality using validated clinical instruments. RESULTS: This study found a high prevalence of poor sleep quality (74%, N = 106). Participants reported anxiety/depressive symptoms with the predominance of anxiety and very high levels of sleep impairment. Better sleep quality was associated with longer sleep duration and better job satisfaction, whereas the use of hypnotic medication and higher depression/anxiety scores seem to point a correlation with sleep impairment. Anxiety/depression positively correlated with worse sleep quality and negatively associated with quality of life. Male sex was negatively associated with perceived productivity. CONCLUSIONS: A higher prevalence of poor sleep quality was found in comparison with other studies performed during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as high levels of anxiety and depression.

Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the viral key 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease enzyme (3CLPro), which controls 2019-nCoV duplications and manages its life cycle, could be pointed as a drug discovery target. Herein, we theoretically studied the binding ability of 10 structurally different anthocyanins with the catalytic dyad residues of 3CLpro of 2019-nCoV using molecular docking modelling. The results revealed that the polyacylated anthocyanins, including phacelianin, gentiodelphin, cyanodelphin, and tecophilin, were found to authentically bind with the receptor binding site and catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) of 2019-nCoV-3CLpro. Our analyses revealed that the top four hits might serve as potential anti-2019-nCoV leading molecules for further optimization and drug development process to combat COVID-19. This study unleashed that anthocyanins with specific structure could be used as effective anti-COVID-19 natural components.","Khalifa, Ibrahim; Nawaz, Asad; Sobhy, Remah; Althwab, Sami A; Barakat, Hassan",J Mol Graph Model,169,26

In June 1895, the collector of the town of the Canadian town of Amherstburg seized an American scow and tug which were accused of dumping garbage into the Detroit River near Canadian waters. As a transboundary waterbody, both the United States and Canada had access to and interest in the Detroit River;it was an important commercial water as well as fishing ground. The garbage contained all sorts of waste including animal offal, much to the chagrin of Amherstburg's residents and officials. In the trial that followed, local officials and residents argued that the garbage interfered with fish catches and was a general nuisance. The collector had seized the vessels only after he had first tried to get a directive from the Ministry of Agriculture. His telegram asking for direction received a reply telegram which was merely an acknowledgement of receipt. When he did hear back, from another ministry, he was told it was a local matter as there was no contravention of a federal policy. To the American owners of the tug and scow, the garbage trial (as it came to be known) was not merely a local issue. Local officials and residents testified to their growing annoyance and the overall inconvenience caused by the dumping at the trail. To federal officials, this remained a local matter. By following the garbage trial and its aftermath, this paper shows how garbage became a local, federal, and transboundary issue, all at once thus exposing the interstitial space that garbage occupies. In so doing, expands our understanding of garbage, pollution, and their evolution as binational issues between the United States and Canada before the formation of the International Joint Commission.","Swayamprakash, R.",Water History,169,22

Risks of treatment include QT segment prolongation, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and death. This comparative pharmacovigilance analysis evaluated the risk of these events. METHODS: Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) (>13 million total reports) were used. Queries extracted reports based on exposures of HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) alone, azithromycin alone, HCQ/CQ + azithromycin, amoxicillin alone, HCQ/CQ + amoxicillin alone. Amoxicillin served as a control. Events of interest included death and TdP/QT prolongation as well as accidents/injuries and depression as control events. Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where a lower limit of the of 95% CI (Lower95CI) value of &#8805;2.0 is interpreted as a potential safety signal. RESULTS: Lower95CIs for HCQ/CQ alone showed no potential safety signals for TdP/QT prolongation, death, or any of the control events included. The PRRs and 95% CIs for TdP/QT prolongation was 1.43 (1.29-2.59) with HCQ/CQ use alone and 4.10 (3.80-4.42) for azithromycin alone. For the combined HCQ/CQ + azithromycin group, the PRR and 95% CI was 3.77 (1.80-7.87). For the control of amoxicillin, there were no safety signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ. CONCLUSIONS: HCQ/CQ use was not associated with a safety signal in this analysis of FAERS data. However, azithromycin used alone was associated with TdP/QT prolongation events and should be used with caution.","Sarayani, Amir; Cicali, Brian; Henriksen, Carl H; Brown, Joshua D",Res. soc. adm. pharm,169,20

This devastating pandemic has brought together communities across the globe to work on this issue in an unprecedented manner. OBJECTIVE: This case study describes the steps and methods employed in the conduction of a remote online health hackathon centered on challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to deliver a clear implementation road map for other organizations to follow. METHODS: This 4-day hackathon was conducted in April 2020, based on six COVID-19-related challenges defined by frontline clinicians and researchers from various disciplines. An online survey was structured to assess: (1) individual experience satisfaction, (2) level of interprofessional skills exchange, (3) maturity of the projects realized, and (4) overall quality of the event. At the end of the event, participants were invited to take part in an online survey with 17 (+5 optional) items, including multiple-choice and open-ended questions that assessed their experience regarding the remote nature of the event and their individual project, interprofessional skills exchange, and their confidence in working on a digital health project before and after the hackathon. Mentors, who guided the participants through the event, also provided feedback to the organizers through an online survey. RESULTS: A total of 48 participants and 52 mentors based in 8 different countries participated and developed 14 projects. A total of 75 mentorship video sessions were held. Participants reported increased confidence in starting a digital health venture or a research project after successfully participating in the hackathon, and stated that they were likely to continue working on their projects. Of the participants who provided feedback, 60% (n=18) would not have started their project without this particular hackathon and indicated that the hackathon encouraged and enabled them to progress faster, for example, by building interdisciplinary teams, gaining new insights and feedback provided by their mentors, and creating a functional prototype. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into how online hackathons can contribute to solving the challenges and effects of a pandemic in several regions of the world. The online format fosters team diversity, increases cross-regional collaboration, and can be executed much faster and at lower costs compared to in-person events. Results on preparation, organization, and evaluation of this online hackathon are useful for other institutions and initiatives that are willing to introduce similar event formats in the fight against COVID-19.","Braune, Katarina; Rojas, Pablo-David; Hofferbert, Joscha; Valera Sosa, Alvaro; Lebedev, Anastasiya; Balzer, Felix; Thun, Sylvia; Lieber, Sascha; Kirchberger, Valerie; Poncette, Akira-Sebastian",J Med Internet Res,169,16

First, we present a range of potential solutions to challenges in research, resulting from the pandemic, and discuss strategies for preserving ongoing research efforts. We discuss approaches to scaling back existing protocols, share ideas for adapting laboratory-based measures for online administration (e.g., using video chat platforms), and suggest strategies for addressing missing data and reduced sample size due to lower participation rates and funding restrictions. We also discuss the importance of measuring COVID-19 relevant factors to use as controls or explore as moderators of primary hypotheses. Second, we discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic represents a scientifically important context for understanding how families adjust and adapt to change and adversity. Increased stress precipitated by the pandemic, varying from acute stress associated with job loss to more chronic and enduring stress, will undoubtedly take a toll.

There are no approved antiviral therapies to treat this viral disease. Here we examined the antiviral abilities of three broad-spectrum antiviral compounds gemcitabine, lycorine and oxysophoridine against SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. We found that all three tested compounds inhibited viral replication in Vero-E6 cells at noncytotoxic concentrations. The antiviral effect of gemcitabine was suppressed efficiently by the cytidine nucleosides. Additionally, combination of gemcitabine with oxysophoridine had an additive antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. Our results demonstrate that broad-spectrum antiviral compounds may have a priority for the screening of antiviral compounds against newly emerging viruses to control viral infection.","Zhang, Ya-Nan; Zhang, Qiu-Yan; Li, Xiao-Dan; Xiong, Jin; Xiao, Shu-Qi; Wang, Zhen; Zhang, Zhe-Rui; Deng, Cheng-Lin; Yang, Xing-Lou; Wei, Hong-Ping; Yuan, Zhi-Ming; Ye, Han-Qing; Zhang, Bo",Emerg Microbes Infect,169,1

CoV spike (S) protein which is crucial for receptor binding, membrane fusion via conformational changes, internalization of the virus, host tissue tropism and comprises crucial targets for vaccine development, remain largely uncharacterized. Therefore, the present study has been planned to determine the sequence variation, structural and antigenic divergence of S glycoprotein which may be helpful for the management of 2019-nCoV infection. The sequences of spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were used for the comparison. The sequence variations were determined using EMBOSS Needle pairwise sequence alignment tools. The variation in glycosylation sites was predicted by NetNGlyc 1.0 and validated by N-GlyDE server. Antigenicity was predicted by NetCTL 1.2 and validated by IEDB Analysis Resource server. The structural divergence was determined by using SuperPose Version 1.0 based on cryo-EM structure of the SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein. Our data suggests that 2019-nCoV is newly spilled coronavirus into humans in China is closely related to SARS-CoV, which has only 12.8% of difference with SARS-CoV in S protein and has 83.9% similarity in minimal receptor-binding domain with SARS-CoV. Addition of a novel glycosylation sites were observed in 2019-nCoV. In addition, antigenic analysis proposes that great antigenic differences exist between both the viral strains, but some of the epitopes were found to be similar between both the S proteins. In spite of the variation in S protein amino acid composition, we found no significant difference in their structures. Collectively, for the first time our results exhibit the emergence of human 2019-nCoV is closely related to predecessor SARS-CoV and provide the evidence that 2019-nCoV uses various novel glycosylation sites as SARS-CoV and may have a potential to become pandemic owing its antigenic discrepancy. Further, demonstration of novel Cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes may impart opportunities for the development of peptide based vaccine for the prevention of 2019-nCoV.","Kumar, Swatantra; Maurya, Vimal K.; Prasad, Anil K.; Bhatt, Madan L.

Since obesity is a risk factor for COVID-19 in adults, children (including adolescents) with obesity might perceive themselves to be vulnerable. Using a combined quantitative and qualitative approach, we explored COVID-19 related anxiety in paediatric patients with severe obesity in the Netherlands using semi-structured telephone interviews and the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) questionnaire, which had also been completed by the study population at baseline in the year prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. In total, 75 families participated in the semi-structured telephone interviews during the lockdown, April 2020. Characteristics of included patients were: median age 10.5 years (interquartile range = 7.6-15.2); 52% female; mean BMI standard deviation score 3.8 (SD = 1.0). COVID-19 related anxiety was reported for 24/75 (32%) children. The mean decrease in PedsQL score between baseline visit and COVID-19 outbreak did not differ between children for whom anxiety was reported vs those for whom it was not (mean change -10.3 ± 36.5 vs -3.3 ± 24.4, P = .54). Self-imposed strict quarantine measures were taken by 19/75 (25%) families. During follow-up, several families reported that the previous contact alleviated their anxiety. In conclusion, healthcare professionals should address possible COVID-19 related anxiety in children with severe obesity. Addressing COVID-19 related anxiety could mitigate its potential negative effects.","Abawi, Ozair; Welling, Mila S; van den Eynde, Emma; van Rossum, Elisabeth F C; Halberstadt, Jutka; van den Akker, Erica L T; van der Voorn, Bibian",Clin Obes,169,30

Our findings evidenced an increase of parenting stress due to the social isolation and the persistency of gender inequalities in not-paid work division causing a penalty for mothers. Nevertheless, during the lockdown, families rediscovered the values of being together inside the house, improving both their cohesion and expressiveness and their positive parenting. Overall, the study shows that Italian families have been resilient and not overwhelmed by family stress, being able to adjust to cope with lifestyle changes. However, the social changes caused by the emergency requires to plan adequate policies to support especially dual-earner families with younger children in these times, both to reduce parenting stress and to avoid that work-family balance difficulties and gender gap will be exacerbated, increasing the risk to relegating women to the domestic sphere during the next phases of this pandemic. © 2020.

The evidence that the hospital can be a place where one might contract the infection and spread the disease has drastically reduced non-COVID-19 accesses to emergency rooms (ER) and to elective non-COVID-19 hospital activities. If this, on one hand, results in reducing improper access to the ER and hospital, on the other hand it substantiates the risk of underestimating problems not connected to COVID-19, such as an increased delay in the diagnosis and treatment of acute myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular emergencies. In addition, the need to reorganize hospital activities to treat patients suffering from serious COVID-19 disease forms forces us to reflect on how to safely manage patients who stay at home with milder COVID-19 disease forms and the need to keep the most vulnerable subjects, such as patients with chronic heart failure, away from the hospital. The problem is furtherly amplified by the uncertain trend of the epidemic, by the duration of forced isolation and limited mobility measures and by the inadequate integration between hospital and territory, especially in high-risk areas such as residences for the elderly or in socially and economically fragile environments. Our opinion is that a syndemic approach, which considers the complex interplay between social, economic, environmental and clinical problems, can be the most appropriate and achieved by means the contribution of telemedicine and telecardiology, intended as integration and not as an alternative to traditional management. A flexible use of telematic tools, now available for teleconsultation, and/or remote monitoring adapted to the needs of clinical, family and social-health contexts could allow the creation of integrated and personalized management programs that are effective and efficient for the care of patients.","Tarantini, Luigi; Navazio, Alessandro; Cioffi, Giovanni; Turiano, Giovanni; Colivicchi, Furio; Gabrielli, Domenico",G Ital Cardiol (Rome),169,21

The current situation is unprecedented. The Covid 19 s high infectivity rate coupled with a high case fatality rate have created a situation where India could see between 2 and 25 lakh deaths over the next 12 to 18 months. The final number of fatalities will depend a great deal on several factors of which surveillance is a critical one. Surveillance will determine the extent to which the government is able to mount a data driven response. Surveillance will help in identifying hot spots and clusters. This in turn will help in mounting targeted responses. In the words of the WHO director general: ""Test, test, test. A fire cannot be fought blindfolded."" India s response has not been satisfactory. This paper discusses the need for a stronger surveillance system and a higher testing rate. If the avalanche of Covid 19 cases requiring hospitalisation comes, the current infrastructure and manpower will be grossly inadequate for it. If India is able to set up a robust and comprehensive surveillance system across urban-rural divides, that might well be a game changer in the covid 19 battle. Failure could mean lakhs more die.","Kamath, Sagarika; Kamath, Rajesh; Sharma, Zinnia; Salins, Prajwal; Madhusudhana, Kamath; Venkatesh, Pai Divya; Mandal, Rajib; Byndoor, Rajesh",Syst. Rev.

Aiming to ""flatten the curve"" a strict Movement Control Order (MCO) was implemented in Malaysia. Older adults with cognitive frailty are prone to physical, cognitive and psychosocial decline. This study aims to compare physical activity patterns, psychological wellbeing and coping strategies of older persons with cognitive frailty in the ""WE-RISE"" trial (intervention versus control) throughout this period. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted as a sub-analysis of the ongoing ""WE-RISE"" randomized controlled trial. This study included 42 community-dwelling older adults, aged 60 years and above, with cognitive frailty, stratified into intervention (n=21) and control (n=21) groups who are receiving a multi-domain intervention and usual care, respectively, within the Klang Valley, Malaysia. Phone call interviews were conducted during the MCO period. Physical activity patterns were assessed using International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Psychological wellbeing was assessed using Flourishing Scale (FS) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), while the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE) assessed coping strategies. Data were analysed descriptively and with independent samples t-test. Results: The WE-RISE intervention group had significantly higher levels of estimated resting energy expenditure (MET) for ""walking activity"" (I:µ=1723.1±780.7;C:µ=537.4±581.9)(p<0.001), ""moderate activity"" (I:µ=1422.8±1215.1;C:µ=405.7±746.9)(p=0.002) and ""total physical activity"" (I: µ=3625.9±3399.3;C:µ=994.6±1193.9)(p=0.002). The intervention group was also significantly more independent in functional activities (µ=1.76±1.73) as compared to the control group (µ=5.57±8.31) (p<0.05). Moreover, significant higher self-perception of living a meaningful life and feeling respected (p<0.05) was demonstrated in regard to psychological well-being in the intervention group. Regarding coping strategies, the intervention group relied significantly on the domains of religion (I:µ=6.43±0.99;C:µ=6.09±1.09)(p<0.05) and planning (I:µ=4.81±0.75; C:µ=4.04±1.28)(p<0.05) whilst the control group relied on humour (C:µ=3.14±1.19; I:µ=2.38±0.74)(p<0.05). Conclusion: Participants of the WE-RISE intervention group were more physically active, functionally independent and had higher self-perceived social-psychological prosperity regarding living a meaningful life and feeling respected; whilst both groups relied on positive coping strategies during the MCO. These results indicate that it is vital to ensure older persons with cognitive frailty remain physically active and preserve their psychosocial wellbeing to be more resilient in preventing further decline during a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Murukesu, Resshaya Roobini; Singh, Devinder Kaur Ajit; Shahar, Suzana; Subramaniam, Ponnusamy",Clin Interv Aging,169,10

Nine months later more than 1.4 million people have died from COVID 19. In this work, the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic on five nursing homes in Austria, which cared for 889 residents in the first half of 2020, were examined. The research question was whether the measures taken were appropriate to prevent an outbreak within the individual facilities. To detect previously unrecognized infections, the present study evaluated the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in residents and employees of the nursing homes. Following the analysis of blood samples, the prospectively collected data was connected to data from screening examinations and data from contact tracing. The present study demonstrated an overall prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in nursing homes of 3.7%. Whereas the prevalence in those facilities that have never been hit by an outbreak is 0%, the prevalence in those facilities with an outbreak is up to 4.9%. Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 35 persons. A retrospective analysis of all 5 included nursing homes demonstrated that upon regular clinical screening in combination with PCRs an infection with SARS-COV-2 was detected in 66 residents and 24 employees from different professional groups. In only 25 of the 35 persons with neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 an infection was proven in advance. This study suggests that specific measures can prevent transmission within a health care facility. Nevertheless, the results also show that a risk reduction to 0% cannot be achieved. In preparation for further pandemic waves there is still the need to reduce the probability of a transmission in nursing homes with specific test strategies.

METHODS: We have retrospectively searched our electronic database and identified 33 pwMS who had a delay in treatment due to COVID-19 pandemics. The following data were extracted: age, sex, multiple sclerosis (MS) phenotype: relapsing-remitting (RRMS) or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), disease duration, Expanded Disability Status scale (EDSS), previous disease modifying therapy (DMT), number of ocrelizumab cycles prior to the lockdown, dates of first ocrelizumab infusion, last ocrelizumab infusion prior to the lockdown and delayed ocrelizumab infusion after the lockdown. Flow cytometry results, relapses and EDSS progression prior to the delayed ocrelizumab infusion after the lockdown were extracted. RESULTS: The mean time between two ocrelizumab infusion during the lockdown was 7.72±0.64 (range 6.07 to 8.92) months. The mean time between last ocrelizumab infusion and the lymphocyte sampling prior to post COVID infusion was 6.59±0.95 (range 5.18 to 8.49) months. In this period, none of the studied patients had a relapse. In a multivariable linear regression analysis, time from last ocrelizumab infusion to lymphocyte sampling prior to the next infusion was the only significant predictor for CD19+ B cells count, when corrected for the number of previous ocrelizumab cycles and MS phenotype (RRMS or PPMS) (B=7.981, 95% C.I. 3.277-12.686, p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: We have not shown clinical consequences of delaying ocrelizumab due to COVID-19 pandemics. However, the delay in dosing of ocrelizumab was an independent predictor of repopulation of B cells.","Barun, Barbara; Gabelic, Tereza; Adamec, Ivan; Babic, Antonija; Lalic, Hrvoje; Batinic, Drago; Krbot Skoric, Magdalena; Habek, Mario",Mult Scler Relat Disord,169,24

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on trauma-related visits to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: A single tertiary center retrospective study was conducted that compared ED attendance of patients with injury-related morbidity between March 2020 (COVID-19 outbreak) and pre-COVID-19 periods: February 2020 and the same 2 months in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Overall, 6513 patients were included in the study. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the daily number of patients visiting the ED for acute trauma declined by 40% compared to the average in previous months (P < 0.01). A strong negative correlation was found between the number of trauma-related ED visits and the log number of confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Israel (Pearson's r = -0.63, P < 0.01). In the COVID-19 period there was a significant change in the proportion of elderly patients (7% increase, P = 0.002), admissions ratio (12% increase, P < 0.001), and patients brought by emergency medical services (10% increase, P < 0.001). The number of motor vehicle accident related injury declined by 45% (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in the number of trauma patients presenting to the ED occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, yet trauma-related admissions were on the rise.","Cordoba, Mordehay; Anteby, Roi; Zager, Yaniv; Barash, Yiftach; Klang, Eyal; Nadler, Roy; Amiel, Imri; Gutman, Mordechai; Horesh, Nir; Aviran, Nimrod; Klein, Yoram",Isr Med Assoc J,169,16

If most of clinical presentations are benign, fragile patients are at greater risk of developing severe or fatal lung disease. Many therapies have been explored with very low impact on mortality. In this context, Kirkby et Mackenzie have published in April 2020 a report reminding the anti-inflammatory properties of low-dose radiotherapy (delivering less than 1Gy) and its use in the treatment of viral and bacterial pneumopathies before antibiotics era. Large in vivo and in vitro data have demonstrated the biological rationale and anti-inflammatory activity of low-dose radiotherapy in many pathologies. Over the past year, three phase I/II clinical trials have been published, as well as one randomized controlled trial, reporting the feasibility and the clinical and biological improvement of a 0.5 to 1Gy treatment dose to the entire lung. 13 other studies, including a randomized phase III trial, are currently ongoing worldwide. These studies may provide data in the effect of low-dose radiotherapy in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

SETTING: Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Epistemonikos COVID-19 in L·OVE Platform, McMaster COVID-19 Evidence Alerts and websites were searched to 15 June 2020. Eligible studies were conducted in high-income countries and used multivariate analyses. PARTICIPANTS: After piloting, screening, data extraction and quality appraisal were performed by a single experienced reviewer. Of 3740 unique records identified, 34 were included that reported on median 596 (range 44-418 794) participants, aged 42-84 years. 19/34 (56%) were good quality. OUTCOMES: Hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, length of stay in hospital or intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, severe disease, mortality. RESULTS: Authors synthesised findings narratively and appraised the certainty of the evidence for each risk factor-outcome association. There was low or moderate certainty evidence for a large (&#8805;2-fold) magnitude of association between hospitalisation in people with COVID-19, and: obesity class III, heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, dementia, age >45 years, male gender, black race/ethnicity (vs non-Hispanic white), homelessness and low income. Age >60 and >70 years may be associated with large increases in mechanical ventilation and severe disease, respectively. For mortality, a large magnitude of association may exist with liver disease, Bangladeshi ethnicity (vs British white), age >45 years, age >80 years (vs 65-69 years) and male gender among 20-64 years (but not older). Associations with hospitalisation and mortality may be very large (&#8805;5-fold) for those aged &#8805;60 years. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing age (especially >60 years) may be the most important risk factor for severe outcomes.

The role young children play in the dynamics of the transmission was unknown. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study over a period of 12 weeks and two days (18 th of June 2020 to 10 th of September, 2020) to screen attendees and staff from day care centres in the state of Hesse, Germany, for both respiratory and gastrointestinal shedding of SARS-CoV-2. 859 children (age range 3 months to 8 years) and 376 staff members from 50 day care centres, which were chosen representatively from throughout the state, participated in the study. Parents were asked to perform both a buccal mucosa and an anal swab on their children once a week. Staff were asked to self-administer the swabs. RT-PCRs for SARS-CoV-2 were performed in a multiple-swab pooling protocol. RESULTS: 7,366 buccal mucosa swabs and 5,907 anal swabs were analysed. No respiratory or gastrointestinal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in any of the children. Shedding of SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in two staff members from distinct day care centres. One was asymptomatic at the time of testing, and one was symptomatic and did not attend the facility on that day. CONCLUSION: Detection of either respiratory or gastrointestinal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in children and staff members attending day care centres was rare in the context of limited community activity and with infection prevention measures in the facilities in place.","Hoehl, Sebastian; Kreutzer, Emilie; Schenk, Barbara; Westhaus, Sandra; Foppa, Ivo; Herrmann, Eva; Ettrich, India; Leondaraki, Maria; Schaible, Alexander; Rudych, Olga; Rabenau, Holger; Berger, Annemarie; Ciesek, Sandra",Clin. infect. dis,169,16

Methods: The observations of social distancing, daily deaths, infections along with the needed hospital resources for COVID-19 patient hospitalizations including the numbers of all hospital beds, beds needed in ICUs and infection wards, nursing staffs needed in ICUs and infection wards were collected from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) by the University of Washington. The observations of social distancing were based on the reduction in human contact relative to background levels for each location quantified by cell phone mobility data collected from IHME. The weighted data per 100,000 population gathered in a 40-day period of the first wave of the pandemic in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Statistical technique of panel data analysis is used to measure the associations between our social distancing and COVID-19 indicators in long-run. Results: Results of dynamic long-run models confirm that a 1% rise in social distancing by reducing human contacts may decline daily deaths, daily infections, all hospital beds needed, beds/nurses needed in ICUs and beds/nurses needed in infection wards due COVID-19 pandemic by 1.13%, 15.26%, 1.10%, 1.17% and 1.89%, respectively. Moreover, results of error correction models verify that if the equilibriums between these series are disrupted by a sudden change in social distancing, the lengths of restoring back to equilibrium are 67, 62, 40, 22 and 49 days for daily deaths, daily infections, all hospital beds needed, nurses/beds needed in ICUs and nurses/beds needed in infection wards, respectively. Conclusion: Proper social distancing was a successful policy for tackling COVID-19 with falling mortality and infection rates as well as the needed hospital resources for patient hospitalizations in Nordic countries. The results alert governments of the need for continuously implementing social distancing policies while using vaccines to prevent outbreaks and reduce the burden of patient hospitalizations on nursing and medical staff.","Amiri, Arshia",,169,16

Consequently, novel and more efficacious agents are urgently needed. We have developed a bispecific antibody, 2022, consisting of two antibodies, 2F8 and VHH18. 2F8 was isolated from our proprietary fully synthetic human IDEAL (Intelligently Designed and Engineered Antibody Library)-VH/VL library and VHH18 is a single domain antibody isolated from IDEAL-nanobody library. 2022 was constructed by attaching VHH18 to the C-terminal of Fc of 2F8. 2022 binds two non-overlapping epitopes simultaneously on the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and blocks the binding of RBD to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 2022 potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and all of the variants tested in both pseudovirus and live virus assays, including variants carrying mutations known to resist neutralizing antibodies approved under EUA and that reduce the protection efficiency of current effective vaccines. The half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2022 is 270 pM, 30 pM, 20 pM, and 1 pM, for wild-type, alpha, beta, and delta pseudovirus, respectively. In the live virus assay, 2022 has an IC50 of 26.4 pM, 13.3 pM, and 88.6 pM, for wild-type, beta, and delta live virus, respectively. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2, 2022 showed strong prophylactic and therapeutic effects. A single administration of 2022 intranasal (i.n.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) 24 hours before virus challenge completely protected all mice from bodyweight loss, as compared with up to 20% loss of bodyweight in placebo treated mice. In addition, the lung viral titers were undetectable (FRNT assay) in all mice treated with 2022 either prophylactically or therapeutically, as compared with around 1x105 pfu/g lung tissue in placebo treated mice. In summary, bispecific antibody 2022 showed potent binding and neutralizing activity across a variety of SARS-CoV-2 variants and could be an attractive weapon to combat the ongoing waves of the COVID-19 pandemic propagated mainly by variants, especially, the much more contagious delta variant.","Zhang, Hui; Huang, Haohui; Li, Rong; Zhang, Lu; Wang, Zhiwei; Li, Jiaping; Chen, Junyou; Su, Huafei; Zheng, Dandan; Su, Ziqi; Wang, Li; Deng, Chunping; Pei, shujun; Zhu, Shenghua; Li, Chan; Yuan, Yaochang; Yue, Haitao; Wang, Yanqun; Li, Xiaobo; Liu, Cuihua; Yu, Jinchen; Li, Shengfeng; Huang, Xianming",,169,29

This paper describes specific scenarios of IPV reported by women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria to provide insight for policy and programmatic efforts. METHODS: This paper draws on seven de-identified case reports from organisations serving women experiencing IPV as well as media coverage of IPV cases in Nigeria, between April and May, 2020. RESULTS: In most cases, reports identified IPV that was occurring prior to the lockdown, but increased in severity or involved new types of violence during the lockdown. The case scenarios included descriptions of many forms of IPV commonly reported, including physical, economic, psychological and sexual violence, often concurrently. Several women also reported threats of being thrown out of their homes by perpetrators, which threatens women's ability to protect themselves from exposure to COVID-19, but could also leave women stranded with no access to transportation, social services, or other resources during the lockdown. Several women also reported IPV that involved custody of children, as well as IPV that disrupted women's income generation. IPV was also reported in relation to economic stressors associated with the lockdown. Reports highlight how the lockdown disrupted women's social support, hindering accessibility of formal and informal sources of help. CONCLUSION: The lockdowns in Nigeria may have inadvertently placed women already experiencing partner violence at risk for experiencing more severe violence, new challenges to cope with violent experiences, and other forms of violence, including violence that used the lockdown as a way to threaten women's security and ability to protect themselves from the virus. Hence, there is need for innovative approaches to support victims, with emphasis on ways in which perpetrators of IPV may be using the threat of COVID-19 to further gain power and control over partners.","Fawole, Olufunmilayo I; Okedare, Omowumi O; Reed, Elizabeth",BMC Womens Health,169,21

Music can contribute to enhancing wellbeing, but the extent of this effect may be modulated by both personal and context-related variables. This study aimed to analyze the impact of the two types of variables on the perceived efficacy of musical behaviors to fulfill adults' emotional wellbeing-related goals during the lockdown established in Spain. Personal variables included age, gender, musical training, personality, resilience, and perception of music's importance. Contextual variables referred to living in a region with a high COVID-19 impact, perception of belonging to a risk group, being alone, having caring responsibilities during confinement, and amount of time of music listening as compared to prior to the crisis. The study was conducted retrospectively during August-December 2020, when the strict lockdown was over in Spain. An online survey was disseminated among the general population and groups of musicians, and the answers of 507 adults (from 18 years on, 73.9% females, 51.3% musically trained adults) were analyzed. Only personal, but not COVID-19 context-related variables, showed an impact on music's efficacy. The youngest age group of adults and those with musical training reported the highest efficacy of music for wellbeing enhancement, and music's importance was found to be the main significant predictor of music's perceived efficacy. Our findings suggest that the people who have been reported to be emotionally more vulnerable during the lockdown, due to either a strong impact on their daily lives or their lower resilience, perceive a higher benefit from musical behaviors. Being musically trained, even for a small number of years, also leads to a perception of higher efficacy of music for the achievement of emotional wellbeing goals. However, this effect is explained by the musically trained individuals' higher perception of music's importance. Although musical behaviors can be generally considered as important for wellbeing enhancement, our study highlights who are the potential individuals who could benefit the most from music-related activities for obtaining better levels of wellbeing, at least within the current context of the COVID-19 crisis.","Martínez-Castilla, P.; Gutiérrez-Blasco, I.

The leukoerythroblastic reaction or leukoerythroblastosis is defined by the presence in peripheral blood of nucleated erythroid cells and immature myeloids. Among its most frequent causes is medullary invasion by solid tumors and hematological neoplasms, so the recognition and consequent study of this reaction is extremely important. To date, only a single case of COVID-19 disease associated with a leukoerythroblastic reaction has been reported worldwide in adult patients. Methodology: In the following manuscript we describe the presence of leukoerythroblastosis in a male hospitalized for COVID-19, in which multiple causes were ruled out. Results: The patient had resolution of the leukoerythroblatosis as his respiratory symptoms resolved. Conclusion: The COVID-19 disease could be a new known cause of a leukoerythroblastic reaction, although we believe that a greater number of reported cases is necessary to affirm that the association was not random.","Milanesio, Martin; Suasnabar, David Francisco; Giaj-Merlera, Alejandro; Cebreros, Rocío Gabriela; Marucco, Federico Ariel",Rev Fac Cien Med Univ Nac Cordoba,169,27

TRIM56 is a cytoplasmic protein whose expression is stimulated by type I interferon and may function as an antiviral agent. Here, the authors conducted a systematic search on papers that reported antiviral effects of TRIM56. AREAS COVERED: The authors conducted a comprehensive search of the PubMed database without time or language limitation, after using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Database terms. Initially, a structured search and full article review yielded 31 papers. Relevant original and review articles on TRIM56 were included. The reference lists were then reviewed, and the cited articles were added. Expert opinion: TRIM56 has been shown to have direct antiviral actions against positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses from the families Flaviviridae, Coronaviridae, and Retroviridae. Moreover, it may be effective against negative-sense single-strand RNA viruses from the families Paramyxoviridae and Orthomyxoviridae, as well as a DNA virus, Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). These studies could suggest the potential of a TRIM56-based antiviral against COVID-19 from the family Coronaviridae, containing single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. However, its efficacy and antiviral mechanisms need to be further examined.","Heidary, Fatemeh; Gharebaghi, Reza",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,169,16

To date, physiologic descriptions have largely focused on gas exchange and respiratory system compliance, however our anecdotal observations suggested that increased airways resistance also commonly contributed to ARF in C19. Normal inspiratory airways resistance (iRaw) has been reported to be 1 cm H2O/L/sec, while unselected patients with ARDS have been reported to have values closer to 5 cm H2O/L/sec (https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm/139.5.1169). Methods: We measured iRaw in a prospective convenience sample of 55 mechanically ventilated patients with C19 in 3 adult ICUs between March and September 2020. There were no exclusion criteria. We collected baseline demographics, date of first positive C19 test, days from intubation until the first captured waveform (see below), gas exchange parameters, inflammatory biomarkers, and 90-day mortality. All C19 medical care including sedation and neuromuscular blockade was determined by the primary team. During measurements of ventilatory mechanics, patients were placed on volume control ventilation 6 ml/kg/PBW, square flow at 60 L/min, and an end-inspiratory hold time of 0.3 seconds. Screen shots of flow-time and pressure-time scalars were captured for later review. iRaw was calculated as peak airway pressure-plateau airway pressure/flow. Results: Patient characteristics are shown in the table. The median iRaw was 12 cm H2O/L/sec (IQR 10-16). iRaw was not significantly different among patients with asthma or COPD compared to those without a history of obstructive airways disease (median 12.5 vs 12 cm H2O/L/sec, respectively, p=0.66). Survival to 90 days among patients with iRaw above 12 cm H2O/L/sec was 68% compared to 60% for patients below 12 cm H2O/L/sec (p=0.58). iRaw did not correlate with CRP, ferritin, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, or static compliance (Cstat). Conclusion: Waveform analysis using a convenience sample of mechanically ventilated patients with ARF due to C19 showed a significant increase in iRaw compared to prior studies done on unselected ARDS patients without C19. Increased iRaw was independent of a history of obstructive airways disease and did not correlate with biomarkers of disease severity nor did it predict mortality. Additional studies will be needed to determine if increased iRaw prolongs the duration of mechanical ventilation in C19.","Nezami, B.; Tran, H.; Zamora, K.; Lowery, P.; Kantrow, S. P.; Lammi, M.

In response, federal guidance was issued regarding the use of technology to maintain mandated contacts with children in foster care. States had to make decisions about how to handle other contact types. This study reviewed documentation of state child welfare agency practices regarding face-to-face contact between case managers and child-welfare involved families between March 2020 and May 2020. Using a point-in-time search to obtain publicly accessible documents related to caseworker face-to-face contact and COVID-19, data was located for 49 states and the District of Columbia (n = 50). Documents were analyzed in NVIVO 12 using document analysis. Within the context of face-to-face interactions by child welfare case managers, documents were analyzed in six themes based on the types of services provided to children and families: (1) investigations, (2) family preservation, (3) family team meetings, (4) foster care, (5) adoption, and (6) general child welfare. State decisions about how to manage these contacts varied. In several states case managers were directed to document both virtual and in-person contacts during this time as face-to-face; which may impact future evaluations of child welfare systems during COVID-19. Findings highlight a range of strategies used by state child welfare systems. By reviewing previous practice and hearing what other states are doing, child welfare service agencies have the potential to evaluate appropriately, strengthen their plans and address disparate impacts.","Seay, Kristen D; McRell, Amanda Stafford",J Child Fam Stud,169,14

This paper examines the impact that these actions had on emissions and expected health effects through reduced personal vehicle travel and electricity consumption. Using daily cell phone mobility data for each U.S. county, we find that vehicle travel dropped about 40% by mid-April across the nation. States that imposed stay-at-home policies before March 28 decreased travel slightly more than other states, but travel in all states decreased significantly. Using data on hourly electricity consumption by electricity region (e.g., balancing authority), we find that electricity consumption fell about six percent on average by mid-April with substantial heterogeneity. Given these decreases in travel and electricity use, we estimate the county-level expected improvements in air quality, and therefore expected declines in mortality. Overall, we estimate that, for a month of social distancing, the expected premature deaths due to air pollution from personal vehicle travel and electricity consumption declined by approximately 360 deaths, or about 25% of the baseline 1500 deaths. In addition, we estimate that CO2 emissions from these sources fell by 46 million metric tons (a reduction of approximately 19%) over the same time frame.","Cicala, S.; Holland, S. P.; Mansur, E.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the factors associated with psychological distress among medical students during the period of enforced home quarantine from March through May 2020. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: One Japanese medical school. PARTICIPANTS: 571 medical students. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-administered electronic questionnaires including the K-6 scale for psychological distress, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) for self-esteem and the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) for self-efficacy were distributed. To assess the determinant factor for psychological distress, variables such as sex, grade in school, living conditions, and RSES and GSES scores were evaluated in regression analysis. RESULTS: 163 respondents (28.5%) scored &#8805;5 on the K-6 scale, indicating a significant degree of psychological distress. Logistic regression revealed that a higher score on RSES (p<0.001) and GSES (p<0.01) was an independent factor associated with lower levels of psychological distress. Multiple regression analysis focusing on students with a K-6 score &#8805;5 revealed that higher scores on RSES correlated with lower levels of psychological distress. By contrast, those with higher GSES scores also scored higher for indicators of psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified that self-efficacy and self-esteem were both influential factors for predicting psychological distress during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Medical schools should provide support for mental health and educational initiatives directed at enhancing self-esteem and self-efficacy, with a focus on improving personal resilience. In emergency situations, such as that faced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, initial programmes might target students with higher levels of self-efficacy. By contrast, under routine situations, these efforts should be directed towards students with lower self-esteem as primary means to prevent depression.","Arima, Makiko; Takamiya, Yusuke; Furuta, Atsuko; Siriratsivawong, Kris; Tsuchiya, Shizuma; Izumi, Miki",BMJ Open,169,1

Method: Retrospective data were collected from the electronic medical record to describe the rehabilitation course of the first 2 consecutive patients admitted to the rehabilitation facility who were recovering from COVID-19. Both patients were octogenarian men who experienced functional decline while hospitalized for symptoms of COVID-19 and were recommended for further inpatient rehabilitation services. Progress during inpatient rehabilitation was tracked using the following outcome measures: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Quality Indicators (QI), 6-Minute Walk Test, 10-Meter Walk Test, Timed Up and Go, and Berg Balance Scale. Results: Patient 1 had an 18-day acute care stay, a 13-day inpatient rehabilitation facility stay, and was discharged to home. Patient 2 had an interrupted 19-day acute care stay, a 15-day inpatient rehabilitation facility stay, and was discharged to a skilled nursing facility. Patient 1 improved 160.98 m in the 6-Minute Walk Test, 0.08 m/s in self-selected walking speed, and 85 points in the total Quality Indicators score. Patient 2 improved 115.22 m in the 6-Minute Walk Test, 0.14 m/s in self-selected walking speed, and 39 points in the total Quality Indicators score. Conclusion: The patients made clinically meaningful improvements in each outcome measure during their length of stay for inpatient rehabilitation.

The British SmPC for the BNT162b2 vaccine already includes reference to a contraindication for use in individuals who have had an allergic reaction to the vaccine or any of its components. As a precautionary measure, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued interim guidance to the NHS not to vaccinate in principle in ""patients with severe allergies"". Allergic reactions to vaccines are very rare, but vaccine components are known to cause allergic reactions. BNT162b2 is a vaccine based on an mRNA embedded in lipid nanoparticles and blended with other substances to enable its transport into the cells. In the pivotal phase III clinical trial, the BNT162b2 vaccine was generally well tolerated, but this large clinical trial, used to support vaccine approval by the MHRA and US Food and Drug Administration, excluded individuals with a ""history of a severe adverse reaction related to the vaccine and/or a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a component of the study medication"". Vaccines are recognized as one of the most effective public health interventions. This repeated administration of a foreign protein (antigen) necessitates a careful allergological history before each application and diagnostic clarification and a risk-benefit assessment before each injection. Severe allergic reactions to vaccines are rare but can be life-threatening, and it is prudent to raise awareness of this hazard among vaccination teams and to take adequate precautions while more experience is gained with this new vaccine.","Klimek, Ludger; Novak, Natalija; Hamelmann, Eckard; Werfel, Thomas; Wagenmann, Martin; Taube, Christian; Bauer, Andrea; Merk, Hans; Rabe, Uta; Jung, Kirsten; Schlenter, Wolfgang; Ring, Johannes; Chaker, Adam; Wehrmann, Wolfgang; Becker, Sven; Mülleneisen, Norbert; Nemat, Katja; Czech, Wolfgang; Wrede, Holger; Brehler, Randolf; Fuchs, Thomas; Jakob, Thilo; Ankermann, Tobias; Schmidt, Sebastian M; Gerstlauer, Michael; Vogelberg, Christian; Zuberbier, Thomas; Hartmann, Karin; Worm, Margitta",Allergo J Int,169,16

The aim of this study was to assess impacts on air quality in São Paulo - Brazil, during the partial lockdown implemented to provide social distancing required due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have analyzed data from four air quality stations in São Paulo, Brazil to assess air pollutant concentration variations during the partial lockdown. Data were compared to the five-year monthly mean and to the four-week before the partial lockdown. Overall, drastic reductions on NO (up to -77.3%), NO2 (up to -54.3%), and CO (up to -64.8%) concentrations were observed in the urban area during partial lockdown compared to the five-year monthly mean. By contrast, an increase of approximately 30% in ozone concentrations was observed in urban areas highly influenced by vehicle traffic, probably related to nitrogen monoxide decreases. Although the partial lockdown has contributed to a positive impact on air quality, it is important to take into account the negative impacts on social aspects, considering the deaths caused by COVID-19 and also the dramatic economic effects.","Nakada, Liane Yuri Kondo; Urban, Rodrigo Custodio",Sci Total Environ,169,24

The goal was to evaluate the impact of different types of COVID-19 stressors (infection fears, lockdown, and economic stressors) on mental health and cognitive functioning. We used a sample of 262 Turkish adults. We administered an online questionnaire that included measures of COVID-19 traumatic stressors, PTSD, depression, anxiety, executive function deficits, and cumulative stressors and traumas (CST). The analyses included correlations, hierarchical regression, path analysis, and PROCESS mediation analysis. All COVID-19 traumatic stressors types and their cumulative load predicted PTSD, depression, anxiety, and executive function deficits after controlling for previous cumulative stressors and traumas and COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 lockdown's stressors were the strongest predictors, compared to COVID-19 fears and economic stressors. Path analysis and PROCESS mediation results indicated that COVID-19 traumatic stressors had direct effects on working memory deficits, direct and indirect effects on PTSD, depression, and anxiety, and indirect effects on inhibition deficits. Anxiety, depression, and inhibition deficits mediated its indirect effects on PTSD. The results have conceptual and clinical implications. COVID-19 continuous posttraumatic stress syndrome that includes comorbid PTSD, depression, anxiety, and executive function deficits is different and does not fit within the current trauma frameworks. There is a need for a paradigm shift in current stress and trauma frameworks to account for the COVID-19 continuous global stressors and for clinical innovations in intervention to help its victims.

Self-report surveys were administered online to a sample of 760 Australian adolescents aged 12-18 years assessing impact on a range of domains including behaviour, education, relationships, lifestyle factors (exercise, technology use, and sleep), and mental health outcomes (psychological distress, loneliness, health anxiety and well-being). Results showed that three quarters of the sample experienced a worsening in mental health, since the pandemic began, with negative impacts reported on learning, friendships and family relationships. There were also high higher levels of sleep disturbance, psychological distress and health anxiety, relative to normative samples. Effects on mental health were worse among those who reported a previous diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety relative to those without no such history.

Considering the imported cases from a typical neighboring country, we study the impacts of control measures under three different levels of control strategy. The simulations for the provinces with risk are given. The numerical experiments show that the current epidemic prevention policy can control the development of the epidemic well in the areas with less imported population;for the provinces with more imported population from the epidemic area, the effective screening and necessary isolation at immigration ports are crucial for preventing the further outbreak caused by imported cases. © 2021, Science China Press.

The virus further exploits the host cellular machinery to gain access into the cells;its spike protein is cleaved by a host cell surface transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) shortly after binding ACE2 followed by its proteolytic activation at a furin cleavage site. The virus primarily targets the epithelium of the respiratory tract which is covered by a tightly regulated airway surface liquid (ASL) layer that serves as a primary defense mechanism against respiratory pathogens. The volume and viscosity of this fluid layer is regulated and maintained by a coordinated function of different transport pathways in the respiratory epithelium. We argue that SARS-CoV-2 may potentially alter evolutionary conserved second-messenger signaling cascades via activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or by directly modulating G protein signaling. Such signaling may in turn adversely modulate transepithelial transport processes, especially those involving cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), thereby shifting the delicate balance between anion secretion and sodium absorption that controls homeostasis of this fluid layer. As a result, activation of the secretory pathways including CFTR-mediated Cl- transport may overwhelm the absorptive pathways such as ENaC-dependent Na+ uptake and initiate a pathophysiological cascade leading to lung edema, one of the most serious and potentially deadly clinical manifestations of COVID-19.","Abdel Hameid, Reem Tambi Richa Nassir Nasna Begum Ghausia Zehra Binte Akter Hosneara Cormet-Boyaka Estelle Kuebler Wolfgang Uddin Mohammed Berdiev Bakhrom",The FASEB Journal,169,27

METHODS: We conducted an interim analysis of the international, multicentre HOPE COVID-19 registry including patients admitted for a confirmed or highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection until 18 April 2020. Those treated with NIV were considered. The primary endpoint was a composite of death or need for intubation. The components of the composite endpoint were the secondary outcomes. Unadjusted and adjusted predictors of the primary endpoint within those initially treated with NIV were investigated. RESULTS: 1933 patients who were included in the registry during the study period had data on oxygen support type. Among them, 390 patients (20%) were treated with NIV. Compared with those receiving other non-invasive oxygen strategy, patients receiving NIV showed significantly worse clinical and laboratory signs of ARF at presentation. Of the 390 patients treated with NIV, 173 patients (44.4%) met the composite endpoint. In-hospital death was the main determinant (147, 37.7%), while 62 patients (15.9%) needed invasive ventilation. Those requiring invasive ventilation had the lowest survival rate (41.9%). After adjustment, age (adjusted OR (adj(OR)) for 5-year increase: 1.37, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.63, p<0.001), hypertension (adj(OR) 2.95, 95% CI 1.14 to 7.61, p=0.03), room air O2 saturation <92% at presentation (adj(OR) 3.05, 95% CI 1.28 to 7.28, p=0.01), lymphocytopenia (adj(OR) 3.55, 95% CI 1.16 to 10.85, p=0.03) and in-hospital use of antibiotic therapy (adj(OR) 4.91, 95% CI 1.69 to 14.26, p=0.003) were independently associated with the composite endpoint. CONCLUSION: NIV was used in a significant proportion of patients within our cohort, and more than half of these patients survived without the need for intubation. NIV may represent a viable strategy particularly in case of overcrowded and limited intensive care resources, but prompt identification of failure is mandatory to avoid harm. Further studies are required to better clarify our hypothesis.

We aimed to describe the spectrum, histology, management and outcomes of renal IrAE in patients with metastatic melanoma undergoing ICI therapy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 23 patients with a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma treated with ICI between January 2017 and April 2019 who developed a renal IrAE. Baseline demographic data, biochemical and histopathological results, management and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The majority of patients who developed renal irAE were male and received combination immunotherapy. The median time of onset from initiation of ICI therapy to renal IrAE was 4 months. 52% of the treated renal IrAE had histopathologically confirmed renal IrAE. The most common histological pattern of injury was acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis (92%). One patient developed anti-GBM disease with non-dialysis dependent stage 5 CKD. In tubulointerstitial injury, there was no association between peak creatinine, renal recovery and histologically reported inflammation or fibrosis. Patients with renal IrAE demonstrated persisting renal dysfunction at 3, 6 and 12 months with a mean baseline, 3 and 12 month creatinine of 90.0 µmol/L, 127.0 µmol/L and 107.5 µmol/L respectively. CONCLUSION: Renal IrAE is most commonly attributable to steroid responsive acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. The outcome of rarer pathologies such as anti-GBM disease may be adversely affected by a delayed diagnosis. There is persisting renal dysfunction following an episode of renal IrAE that may have impact on future renal and overall survival outcomes.","Hultin, Sebastian; Nahar, Kazi; Menzies, Alexander M; Long, Georgina V; Fernando, Suran L; Atkinson, Victoria; Cebon, Jonathan; Wong, Muh Geot",BMC Nephrol,169,20

While anyone can be infected by the virus, the presence of certain chronic diseases has been shown to exacerbate the severity of the infection. There is a likelihood that knowledge of this information may lead to negative psychological impacts among people with chronic illness. We hypothesized that the pandemic has resulted in increased levels of anxiety and depression symptoms among people with chronic illness. We recruited 540 participants from the ongoing Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study in British Columbia, Canada. Participants were asked to fill out an online survey that included the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) to assess anxiety and depression symptoms. We tested our hypothesis using bivariate and multivariable linear regression models. Out of 540 participants, 15% showed symptoms of anxiety and 17% reported symptoms of depression. We found no significant associations between having a pre-existing chronic illness and reporting higher levels of anxiety or depression symptoms during COVID-19. Our results do not support the hypothesis that having a chronic illness is associated with greater anxiety or depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results were similar to one study but in contrast with other studies that found a positive association between the presence of chronic illness and developing anxiety or depression during this pandemic.","Budu, Michael Owusu; Rugel, Emily J; Nocos, Rochelle; Teo, Koon; Rangarajan, Sumathy; Lear, Scott A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),169,1

METHODS: We conducted an observational, monocentric, prospective study of patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis hospitalized during the 3-month period of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary hospital in Madrid (Spain). We describe the neurological diagnoses that arose after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. These diagnoses could be divided into different groups. RESULTS: Only 71 (2.6%) of 2750 hospitalized patients suffered at least one neurological complication (77 different neurological diagnoses in total) during the timeframe of the study. The most common diagnoses were neuromuscular disorders (33.7%), cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs) (27.3%), acute encephalopathy (19.4%), seizures (7.8%), and miscellanea (11.6%) comprising hiccups, myoclonic tremor, Horner syndrome and transverse myelitis. CVDs and encephalopathy were common in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to neuromuscular disorders, which usually appeared later on (p = 0.005). Cerebrospinal fluid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction was negative in 15/15 samples. The mortality was higher in the CVD group (38.1% vs. 8.9%; p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of neurological complications is low in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Different mechanisms appear to be involved in these complications, and there was no evidence of direct invasion of the nervous system in our cohort. Some of the neurological complications can be classified into early and late neurological complications of COVID-19, as they occurred at different times following the onset of COVID-19 symptoms.","Portela-Sánchez, Sofía; Sánchez-Soblechero, Antonio; Melgarejo Otalora, Pedro José; Rodríguez López, Ángela; Velilla Alonso, Gabriel; Palacios-Mendoza, Michael Armando; Cátedra Caramé, Carlos; Amaya Pascasio, Laura; Mas Serrano, Miguel; Massot-Tarrús, Andreu; De La Casa-Fages, Beatriz; Díaz-Otero, Fernando; Catalina, Irene; García Domínguez, Jose Manuel; Pérez-Sánchez, Javier Ricardo; Muñoz-Blanco, José Luis; Grandas, Francisco",Eur. j. neurol,169,1

This paper attempts to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of published articles, to evaluate the association of inflammatory parameters with the severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A comprehensive systematic literature search of medical electronic databases including Pubmed/Medline, Europe PMC, and Google Scholar was performed for relevant data published from January 1, 2020 to June 26, 2020. Observational studies reporting clear extractable data on inflammatory parameters in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Screening of articles, data extraction and quality assessment were carried out by two authors independently. Standardized mean difference (SMD)/mean difference (MD/WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random or fixed-effects models. Results: A total of 83 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Of which, 54 studies were grouped by severity, 25 studies were grouped by mortality, and 04 studies were grouped by both severity and mortality. Random effect model results demonstrated that patients with severe COVID-19 group had significantly higher levels of C-reaction protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-2R (IL-2R), serum amyloid A (SAA) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) compared to those in the non-severe group. Similarly, the fixed-effect model revealed significant higher ferritin level in the severe group when compared with the non-severe group. Furthermore, the random effect model results demonstrated that the non-survivor group had significantly higher levels of CRP, PCT, IL-6, ferritin, and NLR when compared with the survivor group. Conclusion: In conclusion, the measurement of these inflammatory parameters could help the physicians to rapidly identify severe COVID-19 patients, hence facilitating the early initiation of effective treatment.

Complementing this work, here, we report on the social patterning of self-reported positive changes experienced during COVID-19 national lockdown in Scotland. METHODS: The CATALYST study collected data from 3342 adults in Scotland during weeks 9-12 of a national lockdown. Using a cross-sectional design, participants completed an online questionnaire providing data on key sociodemographic and health variables, and completed a measure of positive change. The positive change measure spanned diverse domains (e.g., more quality time with family, developing new hobbies, more physical activity, and better quality of sleep). We used univariate analysis and stepwise regression to examine the contribution of a range of sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, educational attainment, and employment status) in explaining positive change. RESULTS: There were clear sociodemographic differences across positive change scores. Those reporting higher levels of positive change were female, from younger age groups, married or living with their partner, employed, and in better health. CONCLUSION: Overall our results highlight the social patterning of positive changes during lockdown in Scotland. These findings begin to illuminate the complexity of the unanticipated effects of national lockdown and will be used to support future intervention development work sharing lessons learned from lockdown to increase positive health change amongst those who may benefit.","Williams, Lynn; Rollins, Lesley; Young, David; Fleming, Leanne; Grealy, Madeleine; Janssen, Xanne; Kirk, Alison; MacDonald, Bradley; Flowers, Paul",PLoS One,169,26

There is limited information on MERS-CoV pathogenesis, as data from patients are scarce and the generation of animal models reproducing MERS clinical manifestations has been challenging. Human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 knock-in (hDPP4-KI) mice and a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERSMA-6-1-2) were recently described. hDPP4-KI mice infected with MERSMA-6-1-2 show pathological signs of respiratory disease, high viral titers in the lung, and death. In this work, a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV infectious cDNA was engineered by introducing non-synonymous mutations contained in the MERSMA-6-1-2 genome into a MERS-CoV infectious cDNA, leading to a recombinant mouse-adapted virus (rMERS-MA) that was virulent in hDDP4-KI mice. MERS-CoV adaptation to cell culture or mouse lungs led to mutations and deletions in genus-specific gene 5 that prevented full-length protein expression. In contrast, analysis of 476 MERS-CoV field isolates showed that gene 5 is highly stable in vivo, both in humans and camels. To study the role of protein 5, two additional viruses were engineered expressing a full-length gene 5 (rMERS-MA-5FL), or containing a complete gene 5 deletion (rMERS-MA-&#916;5). rMERS-MA-5FL virus was unstable, as deletions appeared during passage in different tissue culture cells, highlighting MERS-CoV instability. The virulence of rMERS-MA-&#916;5 was analyzed in a sublethal hDPP4-KI mouse model. Unexpectedly, all mice died after infection with rMERS-MA-&#916;5 in contrast to those infected with the parental virus, which contains a 17-nt deletion and a stop codon in protein 5 at position 108. Interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was delayed and dysregulated in the lungs of rMERS-MA-&#916;5 infected mice. Overall, these data indicated that rMERS-MA-&#916;5 virus was more virulent than the parental one and suggest that the residual gene 5 sequence present in the mouse-adapted parental virus had a function in ameliorating severe MERS-CoV pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus causing human infections with high mortality rate (â¼35%). Animal models together with reverse genetics systems are essential to understand MERS-CoV pathogenesis. We developed a reverse genetics system for a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV that reproduces the virus behavior observed in humans. This system is highly useful to investigate the role of specific viral genes in pathogenesis. In addition, we described a virus lacking gene 5 expression that is more virulent than the parental one. The data provide novel functions in IFN modulation for gene 5 in the context of viral infection, and will help to develop novel antiviral strategies.","Gutierrez-Alvarez, Javier; Wang, Li; Fernandez-Delgado, Raul; Li, Kun; McCray, Paul B; Perlman, Stanley; Sola, Isabel; Zuñiga, Sonia; Enjuanes, Luis",J. virol,169,23

The international guidelines for the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19 pandemic have been frequently updated. Such guidelines assist the governmental regulatory bodies in taking optimal measures and safeguarding their citizens against the pandemic. We conducted a short survey with a Saudi cohort to understand the awareness about COVID-19 and estimate the responses for mitigation strategies. Methods: An electronic survey was conducted, and the first 388 responses were analysed for publishing an initial report. The questionnaire comprised 27 items and was divided into three sections, namely demographic, awareness, and response to mitigation strategies and participants' self-perceived behaviours regarding COVID-19. The perceptions of the participants were compared with their responses to mitigation measures. Results: In our study, 89.7% understood the meaning of pandemic, while 82.2% correctly identified that the elderly belonged to a high-risk group for the COVID-19 infection. As many as 96.1% agreed that staying at home was one of the mitigation strategies. Nearly 35% preferred self-medication.

The secondary aims were to assess whether there were clinical factors associated with COVID-19 status, the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19, and the rate of potential COVID-19 in patients not presenting to healthcare services. METHODS: A multicentre retrospective study was conducted of patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (1 March 2020 to 31 March 2020) with a minimum of 60 days follow-up. Patient demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, procedure type, primary or revision, length of stay (LOS), COVID-19 test status, and postoperative mortality were recorded. A subgroup of patients (n = 211) who had not presented to healthcare services after discharge were contacted and questioned as to whether they had symptoms of COVID-19. RESULTS: Five (0.5%) of 1,073 patients who underwent hip or knee arthroplasty tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 postoperatively. When adjusting for confounding factors, increasing LOS (p = 0.022) was the only significant factor associated with developing COVID-19 following surgery and a stay greater than three days was a reliable predictor with an area under the curve of 81% (p = 0.018). There were three (0.3%) deaths in the study cohort and the overall mortality rate attributable to COVID-19 was 0.09% (n = 1/1,073), with one (20%) of the five patients with COVID-19 dying postoperatively. Of the 211 patients contacted, two had symptoms within two to 14 days postoperatively with a positive predictive value of 31% and it was therefore estimated that one patient may have had undiagnosed COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The rate of postoperative COVID-19 was 0.5% and may have been as high as 1% when accounting for those patients not presenting to healthcare services, which was similar to the estimated population prevalence during the study period. The overall mortality rate secondary to COVID-19 was low (0.09%), however the mortality rate for those patients developing COVID-19 was 20%.","Clement, Nicholas D; Hall, Andrew J; Kader, Nardeen; Ollivere, Benjamin; Oussedik, Sam; Kader, Deiary F; Deehan, David J; Duckworth, Andrew D",Bone Joint J,169,24

The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has unleashed a pandemic in record time accompanied by an alarming mortality rate mainly due to pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Since there are no effective preventive or curative therapies currently, MSC therapy (MSCT) has emerged as a possible candidate despite the lack of preclinical data of MSCs for COVID-19. Interestingly, MSCT preclinical data specifically on immune/inflammatory disorders of the lungs were among the earliest to be reported in 2003, with the first clinical use of MSCT for graft-vs-host disease reported in 2004. Since these first reports, preclinical data showing beneficial effects of MSC immunomodulation have accumulated substantially, and as a consequence, over a third of MSCT clinical trials now target immune/inflammatory diseases. There is much preclinical evidence for MSCT in noninfectious-including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-as well as infectious bacterial immune/inflammatory lung disorders, with data generally demonstrating therapeutic effects; however, for infectious viral pulmonary conditions, the preclinical evidence is more scarce with some inconsistent outcomes. In this article, we review the mechanistic evidence for clinical use of MSCs in pulmonary immune/inflammatory disorders, and survey the ongoing clinical trials-including for COVID-19-of MSCT for these diseases, with some perspectives and comment on MSCT for COVID-19.","Yen, B Linju; Yen, Men-Luh; Wang, Li-Tzu; Liu, Ko-Jiunn; Sytwu, Huey-Kang",Stem cells transl. med.

AIMS: In the framework of a telemedicine program, we aimed to validate and implement a telephone-administered version of the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (TELE-MPI) among community-dwelling older outpatients. METHOD: From March 9 to May 11, 2020, 131 older patients (82.1 years; 74% females) were interviewed using a telephone-based survey to calculate the TELE-MPI. The standard MPI was performed face-to-face three months apart. The Bland-Altman methodology measured the agreement between the two tools. Multivariate logistic regression models were built to ascertain the prognostic value of TELE-MPI and TELE-MPI classes (low, moderate, or severe risk) on negative outcomes occurring during the lockdown period. RESULTS: Mean MPI and TELE-MPI values were 0.523 and 0.522, respectively. Lower and upper 95% limits of agreement were - 0.122 and + 0.124, respectively, with only 4.6% of observations outside the limits. Each 0.1 increase of TELE-MPI score was significantly correlated with higher incidence of psychiatric disorders [odd ratio (OR): 1.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27, 1.95] and falls (OR: 1.41; 95% CI 1.08, 1.82) in community-dwelling-older adults. DISCUSSION: TELE-MPI showed a strong agreement with the standard MPI and was able to predict psychiatric disorders and falls during lockdown period. CONCLUSION: TELE-MPI may represent a useful way to follow by remote the health status of older adults.","Custodero, Carlo; Senesi, Barbara; Pinna, Alessandra; Floris, Annarosa; Vigo, Martina; Fama, Marcella; Mastropierro, Valeria; Sabbà, Carlo; Prete, Camilla; Pilotto, Alberto",Aging clin. exp. res,169,1

Cox proportional hazards and competing risks analyses were conducted to analyze the impact of corticosteroids on mortality and SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance, respectively. We performed a propensity score (PS) matching analysis to control confounding factors.RESULTSOf 774 eligible patients, 409 patients received corticosteroids, with a median time from hospitalization to starting corticosteroids of 1.0 day (IQR 0.0-3.0 days) . As compared with usual care, treatment with corticosteroids was associated with increased rate of myocardial (15.6% vs. 10.4%, P = 0.041) and liver injury (18.3% vs. 9.9%, P = 0.001), of shock (22.0% vs. 12.6%, P < 0.001), of need for mechanical ventilation (38.1% vs. 19.5%, P < 0.001), and increased rate of 28-day all-cause mortality (44.3% vs. 31.0%, P < 0.001). After PS matching, corticosteroid therapy was associated with 28-day mortality (adjusted HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01-2.13, P = 0.045). High dose (>200 mg) and early initiation (&#8804;3 days from hospitalization) of corticosteroid therapy were associated with a higher 28-day mortality rate. Corticosteroid use was also associated with a delay in SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA clearance in the competing risk analysis (subhazard ratio 1.59, 95% CI 1.17-2.15, P = 0.003).CONCLUSIONAdministration of corticosteroids in severe COVID-19-related ARDS is associated with increased 28-day mortality and delayed SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA clearance after adjustment for time-varying confounders.FUNDINGNone.","Liu, Jiao; Zhang, Sheng; Dong, Xuan; Li, Zhongyi; Xu, Qianghong; Feng, Huibin; Cai, Jing; Huang, Sisi; Guo, Jun; Zhang, Lidi; Chen, Yizhu; Zhu, Wei; Du, Hangxiang; Liu, Yongan; Wang, Tao; Chen, Limin; Wen, Zhenliang; Annane, Djillali; Qu, Jieming; Chen, Dechang",J Clin Invest,169,1

RESULTS: Of 2440 respondents, most were from a city or suburb (69.7%), elementary or middle school (72.3%), and had Title 1 status (60.4%), an indicator of low socioeconomic status. Most campuses were closed during the COVID-19 pandemic (97.8%). Of the schools closed during the pandemic, only 2.8% had no prior PE requirements and that increased to 21% during the pandemic. In schools that remained open during the pandemic, 7.7% had no prior PE requirements and this increased to 60.5%. Importantly, 79% of respondents reported that students were either ""significantly less"" or ""somewhat less"" physically active during the closure. For closed schools, the most frequently cited challenges included ""student access to online learning"", ""teacher/student communication"" and ""teacher remote work arrangements"". For open schools, the most commonly reported challenges included ""social distancing"", ""access to gymnasium/equipment"", and ""concern for personal health and wellbeing"".

Although most COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic or involve mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, a significant number of patients develop severe or critical disease. Patients with severe COVID-19 commonly present with viral pneumonia that may progress to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients with COVID-19 are also predisposed to venous and arterial thromboses that are associated with a poorer prognosis. The present study identified the emergence of a low-density inflammatory neutrophil (LDN) population expressing intermediate levels of CD16 (CD16Int) in patients with COVID-19. These cells demonstrated proinflammatory gene signatures, activated platelets, spontaneously formed neutrophil extracellular traps, and enhanced phagocytic capacity and cytokine production. Strikingly, CD16Int neutrophils were also the major immune cells within the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, exhibiting increased CXCR3 but loss of CD44 and CD38 expression. The percentage of circulating CD16Int LDNs was associated with D-dimer, ferritin, and systemic IL-6 and TNF-&#945; levels and changed over time with altered disease status. Our data suggest that the CD16Int LDN subset contributes to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, systemic inflammation, and ARDS. The frequency of that LDN subset in the circulation could serve as an adjunct clinical marker to monitor disease status and progression.","Morrissey, Samantha M; Geller, Anne E; Hu, Xiaoling; Tieri, David; Ding, Chuanlin; Klaes, Christopher K; Cooke, Elizabeth A; Woeste, Matthew R; Martin, Zachary C; Chen, Oscar; Bush, Sarah E; Zhang, Huang-Ge; Cavallazzi, Rodrigo; Clifford, Sean P; Chen, James; Ghare, Smita; Barve, Shirish S; Cai, Lu; Kong, Maiying; Rouchka, Eric C; McLeish, Kenneth R; Uriarte, Silvia M; Watson, Corey T; Huang, Jiapeng; Yan, Jun",JCI insight,169,30

Vitamin D is a known risk factor for COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association of prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mean vitamin D level with COVID-19 infection and mortality in Asia, predicting with other confounding factors such as median age, obesity, and diabetes. METHODS: COVID-19 infections and mortalities among the Asian countries were retrieved from the Worldometer website. Information on prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mean vitamin D values in each Asian country was retrieved through literature searching on PubMed® and Google scholar. The associations between COVID-19 infections and mortalities with prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mean vitamin D level were explored with correlation coefficients. As a predictive analysis, multiple linear regression was carried out with all confounders. RESULTS: Positive correlations were observed for prevalence of vitamin D deficiency with COVID-19 infections (r = 0.55; p = 0.01; R2 = 0.31) and mortalities (r = 0.50; p = 0.01; R2 = 0.25). Moreover, the associations for the COVID-19 infections and mortalities improved to r = 0.76 (p = 0.002; R2 = 0.58) and r = 0.65 (p = 0.03; R2 = 0.42), respectively, after predicting with confounding factors. Similarly, mean vitamin D level had a significant negative correlation with COVID-19 infections (r = -0.77; p = 0.04; R2 = 0.59) and mortalities (r = -0.80; p = 0.03; R2 = 0.63) when combining with confounders.

We sought to determine if patients with implantable defibrillators residing in areas with high COVID-19 activity experienced an increase in defibrillator shocks during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods and Results Using the Medtronic (Mounds View, MN) Carelink database from 2019 and 2020, we retrospectively determined the incidence of implantable defibrillator shock episodes among patients residing in New York City, New Orleans, LA, and Boston, MA. A total of 14 665 patients with a Medtronic implantable defibrillator (age, 66±13 years; and 72% men) were included in the analysis. Comparing analysis time periods coinciding with the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 with the same periods in 2019, we observed a larger mean rate of defibrillator shock episodes per 1000 patients in New York City (17.8 versus 11.7, respectively), New Orleans (26.4 versus 13.5, respectively), and Boston (30.9 versus 20.6, respectively) during the COVID-19 surge. Age- and sex-adjusted hurdle model showed that the Poisson distribution rate of defibrillator shocks for patients with &#8805;1 shock was 3.11 times larger (95% CI, 1.08-8.99; P=0.036) in New York City, 3.74 times larger (95% CI, 0.88-15.89; P=0.074) in New Orleans, and 1.97 times larger (95% CI, 0.69-5.61; P=0.202) in Boston in 2020 versus 2019. However, the binomial odds of any given patient having a shock episode was not different in 2020 versus 2019. Conclusions Defibrillator shock episodes increased during the higher COVID-19 activity in New York City, New Orleans, and Boston. These observations may provide insights into COVID-19-related increase in cardiac arrests.","Adabag, Selçuk; Zimmerman, Patrick; Black, Adam; Madjid, Mohammad; Safavi-Naeini, Payam; Cheng, Alan",J Am Heart Assoc,169,2

Currently, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most commonly used method to test for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort analysis, we evaluated whether machine learning could exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection using routinely available laboratory values. A Random Forests algorithm with 1353 unique features was trained to predict the RT-PCR results. RESULTS: Out of 12,848 patients undergoing SARS-CoV-2 testing, routine blood tests were simultaneously performed in 1528 patients. The machine learning model could predict SARS-CoV-2 test results with an accuracy of 86% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90. CONCLUSION: Machine learning methods can reliably predict a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result using standard blood tests.","Tschoellitsch, Thomas; Dünser, Martin; Böck, Carl; Schwarzbauer, Karin; Meier, Jens",,169,26

People living with dementia have faced service curtailment, increased risk for COVID-19, as well as potential heightened deterioration. This study reports the experiences of people living with dementia and their family carers during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in England and the impact on them. METHODS: We recruited and remotely interviewed 30 people living with dementia in their own homes and 31 family carers, via video or telephone call in mid-2020. Data were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: People living with dementia often had a basic understanding of COVID-19 restrictions but could have difficulty translating this into personalised risk-appraisal of their own actions. Managing COVID-19 risks facing people living with dementia at home was largely done by family carers, exemplified by changes to living arrangements, which could strain or sustain caring relationships. Well-established familial caring relationships contributed to the wellbeing of the person living with dementia and their carer, as well as keeping to simple routines that included leaving the home for exercise and stimulation. People living with dementia reported some negative psychological and cognitive effects due to the imposed restrictions, such as increased apathy, irritability, or anxiety, which were fuelled by lack of social engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Structuring routine (remote) social interactions where possible could increase social engagement and improve wellbeing for people living with dementia, especially those with limited familial support in a post-COVID-19 context. As some care relationships had been restructured to manage COVID-19 risks, additional carer strain may emerge as a result of the impact on the independence of the person living with dementia and come to the attention of professionals in health and care services. People living with dementia and their carers highlighted the importance of maintaining or adapting routines which may be useful learning for professionals, although additional support may be necessary for those who are impacted by more severe or worsening symptoms of dementia.","Tuijt, Remco; Frost, Rachael; Wilcock, Jane; Robinson, Louise; Manthorpe, Jill; Rait, Greta; Walters, Kate",BMC Geriatr,169,16

So far novel coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks were associated with SARS-CoV-2 (2019), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2012), and SARS-CoV-1 (2003) events. CoV relates to the enveloped family of Betacoronavirus (ßCoV) with positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA). Knowing well the persistence, transmission, and spread of SARS-CoV-2 through proximity, the fecal-oral route is now emerging as a major environmental concern to community transmission. The replication and persistence of CoV in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and shedding through stools is indicating a potential transmission route to the environment settings. In spite of the evidence, based on fewer reports on SARS-CoV-2 occurrence and persistence in wastewater/sewage/water, the transmission of the infective virus to the community is yet to be established. In this realm, this communication attempted to review the possible influx route of the enteric enveloped viral transmission in the environmental settings with reference to its occurrence, persistence, detection, and inactivation based on the published literature so far. The possibilities of airborne transmission through enteric virus-laden aerosols, environmental factors that may influence the viral transmission, and disinfection methods (convention and emerging) as well as the inactivation mechanism with reference to the enveloped virus were reviewed. The need for wastewater epidemiology studies for surveillance as well as for early warning signal was elaborated. This communication will provide a basis to understand the SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses in the context of the environmental engineering perspective to design effective strategies to counter the enteric virus transmission and also serves as a working paper for researchers, policymakers and regulators.","Venkata Mohan, S; Hemalatha, Manupati; Kopperi, Harishankar; Ranjith, I; Kiran Kumar, A",Chem Eng J,169,24

Although advances in treatment have greatly improved survival rates in young patients, in the elderly population, ~70% of patients present poor prognosis. A pan-cancer analysis on the TCGA cohort showed that AML has the second higher HUWE1 expression in tumor samples among all cancer types. In addition, pathway enrichment analysis pointed to RAS signaling cascade as one of the most important pathways associated to HUWE1 expression in this particular AML cohort. In silico analysis for biological processes enrichment also revealed that HUWE1 expression is correlated with 13 genes involved in myeloid differentiation. Therefore, to understand the role of HUWE1 in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) we constitutively expressed KRASG12V oncogene concomitantly to HUWE1 knockdown in stromal co-cultures. The results showed that, in the context of KRASG12V, HUWE1 significantly reduces cell cumulative growth and changes myeloid differentiation profile of HSPCs. Overall, these observations suggest that HUWE1 might contribute to leukemic cell proliferation and impact myeloid differentiation of human HSCs, thus providing new venues for RAS-driven leukemia targeted therapy approach.","Ruckert, Mariana Tannús; Brouwers-Vos, Annet Z; Nagano, Luis Fernando P; Schuringa, Jan Jacob; Silveira, Vanessa Silva",Cancer gene ther,169,14

We aim to equip local public health decision- and policy-makers with mathematical model-based quantification of implemented public health measures and estimation of the trend of COVID-19 in Ontario to inform future actions in terms of outbreak control and de-escalation of social distancing. Our estimates confirm that (1) social distancing measures have helped mitigate transmission by reducing daily infection contact rate, but the disease transmission probability per contact remains as high as 0.145 and case detection rate was so low that the effective reproduction number remained higher than the threshold for disease control until the closure of non-essential business in the Province; (2) improvement in case detection rate and closure of non-essential business had resulted in further reduction of the effective control number to under the threshold. We predict the number of confirmed cases according to different control efficacies including a combination of reducing further contact rates and transmission probability per contact. We show that improved case detection rate plays a decisive role to reduce the effective reproduction number, and there is still much room in terms of improving personal protection measures to compensate for the strict social distancing measures.","Wu, Jianhong; Tang, Biao; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Nah, Kyeongah; McCarthy, Zachary",J Math Ind,169,0

METHODS: We prospectively collected medical records of 14 health care workers (HCWs) who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, in neurosurgery department of Wuhan Union Hospital, China. RESULTS: Among the 14 HCWs, 12 were conformed cases, the other 2 were suspected cases. Most of them were either exposed to the two index patients or infected coworkers, without knowing they were COVID-19 patients. There were 4 male and 10 female infected HCWs in this cohort, whose mean age was 36 years (SD, 6 years). The main symptoms included myalgia or fatigue (100%), fever (86%) and dry cough (71%). On admission, 79% of infected HCWs showed leucopenia and 43% lymphopenia. Reduced complement C3 could be seen in 57% of the infected HCWs and IL-6 was significantly elevated in 86% of them. The proportion of lymphocytes subsets, concentrations of immunoglobulins, complement C4, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-&#945; and IFN-Î³ were within normal range in these 14 infected HCWs.

Aim: We evaluated two rapid tests (Anhui and Clungene) in comparison with those of real-time PCR tests considered as the gold standard in the detection of infection. Method: Between 16, March and 14, April, 2020, we performed rapid IgM and IgG detecting tests without PCR; PCR without rapid tests; and PCR WITH rapid tests in 4140, 3210 and 1654 patients, respectively. (Out of these 1654 patients, Anhui and Clungene tests were used for testing in 625 and 1029 patients, respectively.) Patients were considered as positive in PCR and rapid tests when PCR positivity and IgM or IgG positivity occurred at any time, respectively. (Note: Clungene test is also marketed as 'Lungene'.) Results: The prevalence of PCR positivity in 4864 patients tested with PCR was 6.3%. The sensitivity and specificity of Anhui and Clungene tests were 33.3% and 72.85%, and 35.48% and 85.02%, respectively. At 6% PCR positivity, the positive and negative predictive values of Anhui and Clungene were 7.28%, 94.48%, 13.13%, and 95.38%, respectively. Conclusion: The low positive predictive values indicate that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting the presence of anti-IgM and anti-IgG against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection are not suitable for screening SARS-CoV-2 vírus infection in the general population.

Compounds 1-7 were isolated for the first time from the plant. The isolated compounds were virtually screened against four critical components of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the main protease (Mpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Stilbene dimers 1-4 showed remarkable binding affinities towards the investigated targets (binding energy &lt;−7.6 kcal/mol). Compounds 1, 3 and 4 interacted with the catalytic dyad (Cys145-His41) at the active pocket of Mpro which is essential for achieving good inhibitory activity. Compounds 1-3 showed molecular interaction with the conserved ubiquitin-specific protease residues of PLpro, responsible for binding ability at different active sites of nsp13, which are crucial for decreasing the resistance caused by viral immune evasion. Compounds 2 and 3 showed the ability to bind at different active sites of nsp13, which is a key binding site for reducing antiviral resistance. Finally, compounds 1-3 showed the ability to bind with RdRp before and after RNA binding. Our findings suggested that the dimeric stilbene skeleton is a promising candidate for developing anti-COVID-19 drugs. Particularly, 1, 2 and 3, showed a promiscuity pattern binding to multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Herein, 20 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding energy calculations were performed to estimate the binding affinity of the most potent three compounds against the viral SARS-CoV-2 targets. MM-GBSA calculations unveiled the outshine potency of compound 1 towards PLpro with a binding energy of −60.7 kcal/mol. Structural and energetic analyses over 20 ns MD simulation displayed the high stability of compound 1 in complex with PLpro. The list of the compounds was considered herein forms a primer for clinical investigation in COVID-19 patients and directing for further antiviral examinations.

Furthermore, the underutilization of mental health services among pregnant women has been widely documented. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify factors that are associated with pregnant women's intentions to seek mental health services. We specifically assessed pregnant women who were at risk of mental health problems in mainland China. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted from February to March, 2020 among 19,515 pregnant women who were recruited from maternal health care centers across various regions of China. A subsample of 6248 pregnant women with probable depression (ie, those with a score of &#8805;10 on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire) or anxiety (ie, those with a score of &#8805;5 on the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder Scale) was included in our analysis. RESULTS: More than half (3292/6248, 52.7%) of the participants reported that they did not need mental health services. Furthermore, 28.3% (1770/6248) of participants felt that they needed mental health services, but had no intentions of seeking help, and only 19% (1186/6248) felt that they needed mental health services and had intentions of seek help. The results from our multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, education level, and gestational age were factors of not seeking help. However, COVID-19-related lockdowns in participants' cities of residence, social support during the COVID-19 pandemic, and trust in health care providers were protective factors of participants' intentions to seek help from mental health services. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that promote seeking help for mental health problems among pregnant women should also promote social support from health care providers and trust between pregnant women and their care providers.","Wang, Qian; Song, Bo; Di, Jiangli; Yang, Xue; Wu, Anise; Lau, Joseph; Xin, Meiqi; Wang, Linhong; Mo, Phoenix Kit-Han",JMIR Ment Health,169,16

The study examined stress, anxiety, and coping in a data-driven, real-time assessment of 122 youth with and without ASD and their parents at the height of the COVID-19 shutdown and three-months later. Standardized measures were administered to ascertain stress and coping explicitly related to the pandemic (RSQ COVID-19-Child [self-report], Adult [self-report from the guardian of youth], Parent [report about child]) and anxiety (STAI-C, STAI-A). Multivariate, univariate analyses of variance and hierarchical regression were used. ASD youth endorsed more Trait anxiety and response to specific stressors (e.g., virus). Caregivers of youth with ASD (Adults) self-reported higher anxiety, yet scores were elevated for both groups. Adults of youth with ASD reported more stress, especially related to the virus, access to healthcare, and concern for the future. In the TD group, youth and adults used more Primary and Secondary Control Coping whereas ASD youth and adults used more Disengagement Coping. Adult stress was the primary predictor of parent perception of child stress as well as Child self-reported stress. While the ASD group was consistently high compared to the TD group, there were no significant changes over time for stress or anxiety. Results reveal striking differences in youth with ASD and their parents regarding stress, anxiety, and coping. Findings highlight the need for essential support, access to services, and strategies to enhance psychological and emotional well-being. LAY SUMMARY: This study examined stress, anxiety, and coping related to the COVID-19 pandemic in 61 youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 61 youth with typical development (TD) and their parents. Results showed that ASD youth reported more anxiety and stress. Adults of youth with ASD indicated higher self-reported anxiety and stress than adults of TD youth. TD youth and their parents reported using more adaptive coping strategies. Findings highlight the need for strategies to enhance psychological and emotional well-being.","Corbett, Blythe A; Muscatello, Rachael A; Klemencic, Mark E; Schwartzman, Jessica M",Autism Res,169,12

Material and methods: From 4 March to 15 July 2020 a total of 11 children meeting KD criteria were hospitalised in the Department of Infectious Diseases and Paediatrics, S. Zeromski Specialist Hospital in Krakow and the Clinic of Children's Diseases, Department of Paediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College in Krakow. This paper analyses the data collected and describes in detail the disease in 2 children with PIMS-TS. Results: None of the 11 children who met the criteria of KD had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test on admission. SARS-CoV-2 IgG test results were positive in 2 patients. All children presented with fever, rash, and conjunctivitis;9 with swollen hands and feet;8 with mucous membrane changes;5 with abdominal symptoms;5 with respiratory symptoms;and 1 with neurological signs. As regards laboratory tests, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, lymphocytes, platelets, All were assessed in all patients, albumin in 10/11, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), fibrinogen in 9/11, troponin and ferritin in 6/11, pro-BNP, D-dimers in 8/11.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional questionnaire study, part of the longitudinal UK Medical Applicant Cohort Study (UKMACS). SETTING: UK medical school admissions in 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 2887 participants completed an online questionnaire from 8 April to 22 April 2020. Eligible participants had registered to take the University Clinical Admissions Test in 2019 and agreed to be invited to take part, or had completed a previous UKMACS questionnaire, had been seriously considering applying to medicine in the UK for entry in 2020, and were UK residents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Views on calculated grades, views on medical school admissions and teaching in 2020 and 2021, reported experiences of education during the national lockdown. RESULTS: Respondents were concerned about the calculated grades that replaced A-level examinations: female and Black Asian and Minority Ethnic applicants felt teachers would find it difficult to grade and rank students accurately, and applicants from non-selective state schools and living in deprived areas had concerns about the standardisation process. Calculated grades were generally not considered fair enough to use in selection, but were considered fair enough to use in combination with other measures including interview and aptitude test scores. Respondents from non-selective state (public) schools reported less access to educational resources compared with private/selective school pupils, less online teaching in real time and less time studying during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has and will have significant and long-term impacts on the selection, education and performance of our medical workforce. It is important that the views and experiences of applicants from diverse backgrounds are considered in decisions affecting their future and the future of the profession.","Woolf, Katherine; Harrison, David; McManus, Chris",BMJ Open,169,24

METHODS: This study was institutional review board approved. Reports for CT studies with findings of newly diagnosed diverticulitis within Henry Ford Health System during the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 were reviewed and compared with the same time period in 2019. Total cases of diverticulitis on CT were compared, as well as the prevalence of an associated abscess. A chi-squared analysis was performed to determine the statistical significance of the percentage of patients presenting with an abscess in each year. RESULTS: During the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, 120 patients were identified with CT findings of newly diagnosed diverticulitis with 11.7% of those patients (14 patients) presenting with an associated abscess. During the same time period in 2019, many more CT studies with newly diagnosed diverticulitis were obtained (339), and, compared to 2020, less than half the percentage of those patients had an associated abscess (4.4% or 15 patients). CONCLUSION: Patients with urgent health concerns avoided appropriate and necessary care during the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic. While non-COVID-19 emergency visits were diminished, patients who did present with diverticulitis were more likely to present with greater disease severity as manifested by an associated abscess. Patients must be encouraged to seek care when appropriate and need reassurance that hospitals and their emergency departments are safe to visit. Furthermore, emergency physicians and radiologists in particular should be vigilant during times when emergency volumes are low, such as a future surge in coronavirus patients, other pandemics, snow storms, and holidays as the patients who do present for care are more likely to present at later stages and with serious complications.","Zintsmaster, Michael P; Myers, Daniel T",Emerg. radiol,169,20

In general, older patients often have atypical symptom presentations during acute illness due to a high level of comorbidity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the presentation of symptoms at hospital admissions in older patients with COVID-19 and evaluate its impact on disease outcome. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients &#8805;80 years of age with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2, who were admitted to one of three medical departments in Denmark from March 1st to June 1st, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 102 patients (47% male) with a mean age of 85 years were included. The most common symptoms at admission were fever (74%), cough (62%), and shortness of breath (54%). Furthermore, atypical symptoms like confusion (29%), difficulty walking (13%), and falls (8%) were also present. In-hospital and 30-day mortality were 31% (n = 32) and 41% (n = 42), respectively. Mortality was highest in patients with confusion (50% vs 38%) or falls (63% vs 39%), and nursing home residency prior to hospital admission was associated with higher mortality (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1-6.7). CONCLUSIONS: Older patients with SARS-Cov-2 displayed classical symptoms of COVID-19 but also geriatric frailty symptoms such as confusion and walking impairments. Additionally, both in-hospital and 30-day mortality was very high. Our study highlights the need for preventive efforts to keep older people from getting COVID-19 and increased awareness of frailty among those with COVID-19.","Karlsson, Linda Katharina; Jakobsen, Lasse Hjort; Hollensberg, Louise; Ryg, Jesper; Midttun, Mette; Frederiksen, Henrik; Glenthøj, Andreas; Kodahl, Anette Raskov; Secher-Johnsen, Joanna; Nielsen, Lene Kongsgaard; Bofill, Nuria Gonzalez; Knudtzen, Fredrikke Christie; Lund, Cecilia Margareta",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,169,16

Control measures, based on isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, can decrease and delay the burden of the ongoing epidemic. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, recent modeling work shows that these interventions may be inadequate to control local outbreaks, even when perfect isolation is assumed. The effect of infectiousness prior to symptom onset combined with asymptomatic infectees further complicates the use of contact tracing. We aim to study whether antivirals, which decrease the viral load and reduce infectiousness, could be integrated into control measures in order to augment the feasibility of controlling the epidemic. METHODS: Using a simulation-based model of viral transmission, we tested the efficacy of different intervention measures to control local COVID-19 outbreaks. For individuals that were identified through contact tracing, we evaluate two procedures: monitoring individuals for symptoms onset and testing of individuals. Additionally, we investigate the implementation of an antiviral compound combined with the contact tracing process. RESULTS: For an infectious disease in which asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections are plausible, an intervention measure based on contact tracing performs better when combined with testing instead of monitoring, provided that the test is able to detect infections during the incubation period. Antiviral drugs, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation, result in a significant decrease of the final size and the peak incidence, and increase the probability that the outbreak will fade out. CONCLUSION: In all tested scenarios, the model highlights the benefits of control measures based on the testing of traced individuals. In addition, the administration of an antiviral drug, together with quarantine, isolation, and contact tracing, is shown to decrease the spread of the epidemic. This control measure could be an effective strategy to control local and re-emerging outbreaks of COVID-19.","Torneri, Andrea; Libin, Pieter; Vanderlocht, Joris; Vandamme, Anne-Mieke; Neyts, Johan; Hens, Niel",BMC Med,169,21

Until now, there is no known safe treatment, hence the immunity system of the individual has a crucial role in recovering from this contagious disease. In general, the aged individuals probably have the highest rate of mortality due to COVID-19. It is well known that this immunity system can be affected by the age of the individual, so it is wise to consider an age-structured SEIR system to model Coronavirus transmission. For the COVID-19 epidemic, the individuals in the incubation stage are capable of infecting the susceptible individuals. All the mentioned points are regarded in building the responsible predictive mathematical model. The investigated model allows us to predict the spread of COID-19 in South Africa, Turkey, and Brazil. The epidemic peak outbreak in these countries is considered, and the estimated time of the end of infection is regarded by the help of some numerical simulations.

In this study, a continent-wide analysis of COVID-19 cases from 31st December 2019 to 14th June 2020 was performed along with socio-economic factors associated with mortality rates as well as a predicted future scenario of COVID-19 cases until the end of 2020. METHODS: Epidemiological and statistical tools such as linear regression, Pearson's correlation analysis, and the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model were used in this study. RESULTS: This study shows that the highest number of cases per million population was recorded in Europe, while the trend of new cases is lowest in Africa. The mortality rates in different continents were as follows: North America 4.57%, Europe 3.74%, South America 3.87%, Africa 3.49%, Oceania and Asia less than 2%. Linear regression analysis showed that hospital beds, GDP, diabetes, and higher average age were the significant risk factors for mortality in different continents. The forecasting analysis since the first case of COVID-19 until 1st January 2021 showed that the worst scenario at the end of 2020 predicts a range from 0 to 300,000 daily new cases and a range from 0 to 16,000 daily new deaths.

ABCB4 is an ATP-dependent transporter that reduces the harsh detergent effect of the bile salts by counteracting self-digestion. To do so ABCB4 provides PC-lipids for extraction into bile. PC-lipids account for 40% of the entire pool of lipids in the canalicular membrane with an unknown distribution over both leaflets. Extracted PC lipids end up in so-called mixed micelles. Mixed micelles are composed of phospholipids, bile salts and cholesterol. 90-95% of the phospholipids are member of the of the PC family, but only a subset of mainly 16.0-18:1 PC and 16:0-18:2 PC variants are present. To elucidate if ABCB4 is the key discriminator in this enrichment of specific PC-lipids, we used in vitro studies to identify crucial determinants substrate selection. We demonstrate PC-lipid moieties alone are insufficient for stimulating ABCB4 ATPase activity, and that at least two acyl chains and the backbone itself are required for a productive interaction. The nature of the fatty acids like length or saturation, has a quantitative impact on the ATPase activity. Our data demonstrate a two-step enrichment and protective function of ABCB4 to mitigate the harsh detergent effect of the bile salts, since ABCB4 can translocate more than just the PC-lipid variants found in bile.","Prescher, Martin; Smits, Sander H J; Schmitt, Lutz",J. lipid. res,169,2

The purpose of this investigation is to understand the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on Dow Jones and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil returns in relation to other crises using the Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model. The results indicate that COVID-19 and the accompanying lockdown have adversely impacted both yields and that the impact on oil prices is more significant than on the Dow Jones index. The variance and squared residuals of oil prices and the Dow Jones reached their highest historical levels during the COVID-19 outbreak, even higher than during the global financial crisis, and especially the VaR of both markets reached their historical peak points during the COVID-19 era. The variance of WTI during COVID-19 is higher than that of DJI, as was also the case during the financial crisis. These findings confirm that COVID-19 has negatively impacted investors’ ability to determine optimal portfolios and thus the sustainability of financial and energy markets more than the global financial crisis of 2007–2009. We, therefore, suggest that policy changes are needed to maintain financial sustainability and help investors deal with future financial and other crises.","Shehzad, Khurram Zaman Umer Liu Xiaoxing Górecki Jarosław Pugnetti Carlo",Sustainability,169,1

While the neurobiology underwriting the perception of emotions is well studied, the mechanisms for detecting a lack of emotional content in social signals remain largely unknown. Here, using cutting-edge analyses of effective brain connectivity, we uncover the brain networks differentiating neutral and emotional body language. The data indicate greater activation of the right amygdala and midline cerebellar vermis to nonemotional as opposed to emotional body language. Most important, the effective connectivity between the amygdala and insula predicts people's ability to recognize the absence of emotion. These conclusions extend substantially current concepts of emotion perception by suggesting engagement of limbic effective connectivity in recognizing the lack of emotion in body language reading. Furthermore, the outcome may advance the understanding of overly emotional interpretation of social signals in depression or schizophrenia by providing the missing link between body language reading and limbic pathways. The study thus opens an avenue for multidisciplinary research on social cognition and the underlying cerebrocerebellar networks, ranging from animal models to patients with neuropsychiatric conditions.","Sokolov, Arseny A; Zeidman, Peter; Erb, Michael; Pollick, Frank E; Fallgatter, Andreas J; Ryvlin, Philippe; Friston, Karl J; Pavlova, Marina A",Proc.

However, understanding a possible future effect of climate, as susceptibility declines and the northern-hemisphere winter approaches, is an important open question. Here we use an epidemiological model, constrained by observations, to assess the sensitivity of future SARS-CoV-2 disease trajectories to local climate conditions. We find this sensitivity depends on both the susceptibility of the population and the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in reducing transmission. Assuming high susceptibility, more stringent NPIs may be required to minimize outbreak risk in the winter months. Our results suggest that the strength of NPIs remain the greatest determinant of future pre-vaccination outbreak size. While we find a small role for meteorological forecasts in projecting outbreak severity, reducing uncertainty in epidemiological parameters will likely have a more substantial impact on generating accurate predictions.","Baker, Rachel E; Yang, Wenchang; Vecchi, Gabriel A; Metcalf, C Jessica E; Grenfell, Bryan T",Nat Commun,169,29

Social Issue Theater program, a one-hour psychodramatic intervention by professional actors;it also measured students' receptiveness to the intervention METHODS: This study was a two-arm cluster randomized control trial with 1:1 allocation that randomized either to the ACT Out! intervention or control (treatment as usual) at the classroom level (n = 76 classrooms in 12 schools across five counties in Indiana, comprised of n = 1,571 students at pretest in 4th, 7th, and 10th grades) The primary outcomes were self-reported social-emotional competence, bullying perpetration, and bullying victimization, and the secondary outcomes were receptiveness to the intervention, implementation fidelity (independent observer observation), and prespecified sub-analyses of social-emotional competence for 7th and 10th grade students All outcomes were collected at baseline and two-week posttest, with planned three-month posttest data collection being prevented by the COVID-19 pandemic RESULTS: Intervention fidelity was uniformly excellent (&gt; 96% adherence), and students were highly receptive to the program However, trial results did not support the hypothesis that the intervention would increase participants' social-emotional competence The intervention's impact on bullying was complicated to interpret and included some evidence of small interaction effects (reduced cyberbullying victimization and increased physical bullying perpetration) Additional, pooled within-group reductions were also observed and discussed, but were not appropriate for causal attribution CONCLUSIONS: This study found no superiority for a one-hour ACT Out! intervention compared to treatment as usual for social-emotional competence or offline bullying, but some evidence of a small effect for cyberbullying On the basis of these results and the within-group effects, as a next step, we encourage research into whether the ACT Out! intervention may engender a bystander effect not amenable to randomization by classroom We therefore recommend a larger trial of the ACT Out! intervention that is focused specifically on cyberbullying, measures bystander behavior, is randomized by school, and is controlled for extant bullying prevention efforts at each school CLINICALTRIAL: This study was prospectively registered with Clinicaltrials gov (NCT04097496), and the study protocol is available at https://doi org/10 2196/17900 International registered report: Rr2-10 2196/17900",,JMIR Mental Health,169,26

METHODS: This study was exempted from review by institutional review board waiver. A flexible fiberoptic endoscopy was placed through stellate openings in the standard face shield and the enhanced face shield. A series of simulated coughs were created with bursts of fluorescein dye through an atomizer tip placed within the test participant's mouth. Ultraviolet lighting illuminated the test area, and areas of dye splatter were noted. RESULTS: Fluorescein dye is easily aerosolized along the lateral inferior aspect of a standard shield with significant contamination of the surrounds. The enhanced face shield maintained a barrier to the aerosolized dye. DISCUSSION: Face shields, rather than face masks, should be considered a preferred alternative for the public and for health care professionals alike, as they address many of the personal protective equipment concerns especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Otolaryngologists are at high risk from aerosol-generating procedures, such as flexible fiberoptic endoscopy, even when wearing personal protective equipment. Here we describe a uniquely designed face shield to be worn by the patient as another layer of protection for the environment and for medical personnel.

We describe the switch from in-person didactic sessions to videoconferencing in a Neurology department. We analyse the opinions and satisfaction of participants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Narrative description of the adopted measures; Online survey among participants. RESULTS: One of the three weekly sessions was cancelled, and two switched to videoconferencing. There were more participants online than in the conference hall. 49 users answered the survey, 51% women, mean age 40.5 years (range 25-65). Satisfaction was higher for previous face-to-face meetings (8.68) than for videoconferencing (8.12) (p=0.006). There was a significant inverse correlation between age and satisfaction with virtual sessions (r=-0.37; p=0.01), that was not found for in-person attendance. Most users (75.5%) would prefer to continue with online sessions when the pandemic is over, and 87.8% support inter-hospital remote meetings, but the safety of web platforms is a concern (53.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The change from in-person to virtual sessions is an easy measure to implement in a neurology department, with a good degree of satisfaction among users.

The following assumptions held to be true: (1) the generation-specific retention needs of Millennials are applicable to educators across generations.;(2) high-quality professional development is a key factor in retaining teachers;(3) to provide high-quality support for teachers, schools must carefully craft an effective holding environment that is differentiated developmentally.The site for the study was a high-poverty urban charter network in the Northeastern United States that struggled to retain teachers. The primary sources of data were interviews with 15 millennial teacher leaders, a focus group of five principals, and a document analysis.The findings were analyzed through the four lenses presented in the conceptual framework: motivation for staying, how they learn, what they learn, and reactions to the pandemic. Each of these lenses directly aligned to the study's four research questions. The analysis served to code the disaggregated data per these four lenses and the synthesis served to reveal teacher perceptions falling into three categories that were then used to further interpret the analysis.The major findings were: (1) A strong majority of participants indicated they were motivated to stay in a high attrition environment because they liked their colleagues;while an equal number cited the positive school culture as a contributing factor to their retention. (2) A slight majority of participants indicated that the Covid-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to be innovative. (3) A majority of participants indicated a desire to develop their capacity for learning and leading. (4) A strong majority of participants described they learned largely in informal ways by dialoguing with others and through observation.The principal recommendation from this study is that in order to retain teachers in a high attrition environment, there must be a positive school culture. Schools that want to retain employees need to 1) provide learning opportunities and support the development of leadership skills and 2) support and provide the resources for informal adult learning to maintain this culture.

Such assumption is created solely from the applicable health protocols and protective measures to avoid COVID-19 transmission in pesantren. As a matter of fact, pesantrens are known to have applied a distinctive way of coping with COVID-19. This study aims to elucidate the theology of health of Quranic pesantren in the face of COVID-19. Research data were generated through observational method on three Quranic pesantrens in Yogyakarta, interviews with caregivers, the COVID-19 task force of the pesantren, santri and documentation related to the handling of COVID-19 in the three pesantrens. The results showed that the Quranic pesantren as a subculture has a distinctive way of dealing with COVID-19 pandemic by integrating modified health protocols in accordance with the actual conditions of the pesantren and by applying rituals of Islamic spirituality by reciting verses of the Qur’an, salawat (prayers for the Prophet), prayers and hizib (prayer for salvation and rejecting calamities). Three pesantrens chose these methods by drawing on the belief that COVID-19 is God’s creature and, thus, it only works on God’s orders and will stop if God wills. In line with this, this study suggests a method for handling COVID-19 by not only emphasising the health protocols and medical procedures but also taking into account the importance of local wisdom. Contribution statement: This article contributes to the strategy of COVID-19 handling by combining the health protocols of COVID-19 and the applicable local wisdom, such as religious ritual as practiced by numerous pesantren in Indonesia. © 2021.

It is also the second common cancer deaths of women in Ethiopia followed by breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the pooled prevalence and associated factors of precancerous cervical lesions among women in Ethiopia. Methods: We systematically searched published and unpublished articles reported from 2010 to 2019 using a comprehensive search of electronic databases including PubMed and Google scholar for grey literature from August 1 to September 1, 2019. The methodological qualities of included studies were evaluated using Joanna Briggs Institute meta-analysis of Statistics Assessment. The pooled prevalence estimate was calculated using MedCalc software-version 19.0.7, and the pooled odd ratios for predictors was calculated using RevMan software version 5.3. Results: The pooled prevalence of precancerous cervical lesions among women in Ethiopia was 13.4% (95% CI:10.63% 16.37%). Statistically significant heterogeneity between studies was detected (I2=83.1%, P < 0.001). Among all measured associated factors: numbers of women life time sexual partners > 1, OR=2.5 (95% CI:3.70,4.76), being HIV positive women, OR=2.4 (95% CI:1.33,4.61) and women having history of STI, OR=2.0 (95% CI:1.02,3.87) had statistically significant association with precancerous cervical lesions among women in Ethiopia. Conclusion: The pooled prevalence of precancerous cervical lesions among women in Ethiopia was high as compared to the 5-year worldwide cervical cancer prevalence.

The recent SARS-CoV-2 presents the main protease (MCoV2pro) with 12 mutations compared to SARS-CoV (MCoV1pro). Recent studies point out that these subtle differences lead to mobility variances at the active site loops with functional implications. We use metadynamics simulations and a sort of computational analysis to probe the dynamic, pharmacophoric and catalytic environment differences between the monomers of both enzymes. So, we verify how much intrinsic distinctions are preserved in the functional dimer of MCoV2pro, as well as its implications for ligand accessibility and optimized drug screening. We find a significantly higher accessibility to open binding conformers in the MCoV2pro monomer compared to MCoV1pro. A higher hydration propensity for the MCoV2pro S2 loop with the A46S substitution seems to exercise a key role. Quantum calculations suggest that the wider conformations for MCoV2pro are less catalytically active in the monomer. However, the statistics for contacts involving the N-finger suggest higher maintenance of this activity at the dimer. Docking analyses suggest that the ability to vary the active site width can be important to improve the access of the ligand to the active site in different ways. So, we carry out a multiconformational virtual screening with different ligand bases. The results point to the importance of taking into account the protein conformational multiplicity for new promissors anti MCoV2pro ligands. We hope these results will be useful in prospecting, repurposing and/or designing new anti SARS-CoV-2 drugs.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Because the virus is transmitted predominantly by inhaling respiratory droplets from infected persons, universal mask use can help reduce transmission (1). Starting in April, 39 states and the District of Columbia (DC) issued mask mandates in 2020. Reducing person-to-person interactions by avoiding nonessential shared spaces, such as restaurants, where interactions are typically unmasked and physical distancing (&#8805;6 ft) is difficult to maintain, can also decrease transmission (2). In March and April 2020, 49 states and DC prohibited any on-premises dining at restaurants, but by mid-June, all states and DC had lifted these restrictions. To examine the association of state-issued mask mandates and allowing on-premises restaurant dining with COVID-19 cases and deaths during March 1-December 31, 2020, county-level data on mask mandates and restaurant reopenings were compared with county-level changes in COVID-19 case and death growth rates relative to the mandate implementation and reopening dates. Mask mandates were associated with decreases in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-80, and 81-100 days after implementation. Allowing any on-premises dining at restaurants was associated with increases in daily COVID-19 case growth rates 41-60, 61-80, and 81-100 days after reopening, and increases in daily COVID-19 death growth rates 61-80 and 81-100 days after reopening. Implementing mask mandates was associated with reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whereas reopening restaurants for on-premises dining was associated with increased transmission. Policies that require universal mask use and restrict any on-premises restaurant dining are important components of a comprehensive strategy to reduce exposure to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (1). Such efforts are increasingly important given the emergence of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States (3,4).","Guy, Gery P; Lee, Florence C; Sunshine, Gregory; McCord, Russell; Howard-Williams, Mara; Kompaniyets, Lyudmyla; Dunphy, Christopher; Gakh, Maxim; Weber, Regen; Sauber-Schatz, Erin; Omura, John D; Massetti, Greta M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,169,2

This immunization protocol elicited significant increases in serum and lachrymal levels of anti-IBV IgG antibodies and upregulated the expression of CMI response genes, such as those encoding CD8β chain and Granzyme homolog A in tracheal and kidney tissues at 3, 7, and 11 days post-infection in the vaccinated chickens. Additionally, vaccinated and challenged chickens showed reduced viral loads and microscopic lesion counts in tracheal and kidney tissues, and their antibody and CMI responses were negatively correlated with viral loads in the trachea and kidney. In conclusion, the combination of live attenuated vaccine containing the Massachusetts strain with a booster dose of an inactivated vaccine, containing a BR-I IBV strain, confers effective protection against infection with nephropathogenic homologous IBV strain because of the induction of consistent memory immune responses mediated by IgG antibodies and TCD8 cells in the mucosal and systemic compartments of chickens submitted to this vaccination regime.","dos SANTOS, Romeu Moreira; FERNANDO, Filipe Santos; MONTASSIER, Maria de Fátima Silva; SILVA, Ketherson Rodrigues; LOPES, Priscila Diniz; PAVANI, Caren; BORZI, Mariana Monezi; OKINO, Cintia Hiromi; MONTASSIER, Helio José",J Vet Med Sci,169,1

AIMS: To describe the features and impact of an assistance model involving an intermediate care mobile medical specialist team (GIROT, Gruppo Intervento Rapido Ospedale Territorio) aimed at delivering “hospital-at-nursing home” care to NH residents with COVID-19 in Florence, Italy. METHODS: The GIROT activity was set-up during the first wave of the pandemic (W1, March–April 2020) and became a structured healthcare model during the second (W2, October 2020–January 2021). The activity involved (1) infection transmission control among NHs residents and staff, (2) comprehensive geriatric assessment including prognostication and geriatric syndromes management, (3) on-site diagnostic assessment and protocol-based treatment of COVID-19, (4) supply of nursing personnel to understaffed NHs. To estimate the impact of the GIROT intervention, we reported hospitalization and infection lethality rates recorded in SARS-CoV-2-positive NH residents during W1 and W2. RESULTS: The GIROT activity involved 21 NHs (1159 residents) and 43 NHs (2448 residents) during W1 and W2, respectively. The percentage of infected residents was higher in W2 than in W1 (64.5% vs. 38.8%), while both hospitalization and lethality rates significantly decreased in W2 compared to W1 (10.1% vs 58.2% and 23.4% vs 31.1%, respectively). DISCUSSION: Potentiating on-site care in the NHs paralleled a decrease of hospital admissions with no increase of lethality. CONCLUSIONS: An innovative “hospital-at-nursing home” patient-centred care model based on comprehensive geriatric assessment may provide a valuable contribution in fighting COVID-19 in NH residents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patient and pathway characteristics including prioritization strategies at the Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer located at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust (RFH) before and during the surge of COVID‐19. RESULTS: On 18 March 2020 all elective surgery was halted at RFH to redeploy resources and staff for the COVID‐19 surge. Prioritizing of patients according to European Association of Urology guidance was introduced. Clinics and the specialist multidisciplinary team (SMDT) meetings were maintained with physical distancing, kidney surgery was moved to a COVID‐protected site, and infection prevention measurements were enforced. During the 7 weeks of lockdown (23 March to 10 May 2020), 234 cases were discussed at the SMDT meetings, 53% compared to the 446 cases discussed in the 7 weeks pre‐lockdown.

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed among 758 'frontline' health care workers who cared for SARS patients at the Second Affiliated Hospital and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The HCWs with IgG against SARS and those without IgG against SARS were respectively defined as the ""case group"" and the ""control group"", and logistic regression was conducted to explore the risk factors for SARS infection in HCWs. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, gender, marital status, educational level, professional title, and the department in which an individual worked, the results of a multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that incidence of SARS among HCWs was significantly and positively associated with: performing tracheal intubations for SARS patients, methods used for air ventilation in wards, avoiding face-to-face interaction with SARS patients, the number of pairs of gloves worn by HCWs, and caring for serious SARS cases. CONCLUSION: Some measures, particularly good air ventilation in SARS wards, may be effective in minimizing or preventing SARS transmission among HCWs in hospitals.","Chen, Wei-Qing; Ling, Wen-Hua; Lu, Ci-Yong; Hao, Yuan-Tao; Lin, Zhong-Ning; Ling, Li; Huang, Jian; Li, Gang; Yan, Guang-Mei",BMC Public Health,169,22

In case of COVID-19 this spreading behaviour is quantitatively better described with a mobility-driven SIR-SEIR model [2] rather than the homogenous mixing models. Lockdown has dramatically slowed down the spread of COVID-19 in UK, and even more significantly, has changed the growth in the total number of infected from exponential to quadratic. This significant change is due to a transition from a mobility-driven epidemic spreading to a spatial epidemic which is dominated by slow growth of spatially isolated clusters of infected population. Our results strongly indicate that, to avoid a return to exponential growth of COVID-19 (also known as second wave), mobility restrictions should not be prematurely lifted. Instead mobility should be kept restricted while new measures, such as wearing of masks and contact tracing, get implemented in order to prevent health services becoming overwhelmed due to a resurgence of exponential growth.","Nekovee, Maziar",,169,18

We evaluated patient satisfaction with AVD in the setting of conscious RA for limb surgery using patient reported experience measures (PREMs). Service evaluation using PREMs, via standardised post-operative patient questionnaire, in a single tertiary referral centre for orthopaedic and plastic surgery over an 18-month period. Outcome measures included impact of AVD on peri-operative anxiety, comfort, satisfaction and comparison with previous general anaesthesia (GA) experiences. 50 adult patients undergoing elective limb surgery under RA ± sedation were provided with a wifi-enabled tablet device peri-operatively and completed a post-operative questionnaire regarding their AVD experience. 100% were satisfied with AVD and would recommend to others. 78% were anxious before or during the procedure, of which 97% felt that AVD improved their anxiety levels. Of the 94% with previous experience of GA, 89% reported a 'better' experience with RA + AVD. PREMs regarding AVD were encouraging and lay a foundation for further clinical service development and research into incorporation of this technique for appropriate RA patient groups. Our findings are particularly relevant in the COVID-affected era of anaesthesia as RA benefits and strategies to minimise anxiety are reappraised.","McMahon, Orlaith; Athanassoglou, Vassilis; Galitzine, Svetlana",J Vis Commun Med,169,22

To meet that need, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), the nation’s largest hospital surveillance system, launched a module for collecting hospital coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) data. We present time-series estimates of the critical hospital capacity indicators from April 1 to July 14, 2020. DESIGN: From March 27 to July 14, 2020, the NHSN collected daily data on hospital bed occupancy, number of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and the availability and/or use of mechanical ventilators. Time series were constructed using multiple imputation and survey weighting to allow near–real-time daily national and state estimates to be computed. RESULTS: During the pandemic’s April peak in the United States, among an estimated 431,000 total inpatients, 84,000 (19%) had COVID-19. Although the number of inpatients with COVID-19 decreased from April to July, the proportion of occupied inpatient beds increased steadily. COVID-19 hospitalizations increased from mid-June in the South and Southwest regions after stay-at-home restrictions were eased. The proportion of inpatients with COVID-19 on ventilators decreased from April to July. CONCLUSIONS: The NHSN hospital capacity estimates served as important, near–real-time indicators of the pandemic’s magnitude, spread, and impact, providing quantitative guidance for the public health response. Use of the estimates detected the rise of hospitalizations in specific geographic regions in June after they declined from a peak in April. Patient outcomes appeared to improve from early April to mid-July.","Sapiano, Mathew R.

The rate of infected healthcare workers is > 10% in Italy. Within this dramatic scenario, the development of new personal protective equipment (PPE) devices is mandatory. This study focuses on validation of modified full-face snorkel masks (MFFSM) as safe and protective equipment against SARS-CoV-2 infection during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures on the upper aerodigestive tract. METHODS: Five different MFFSM were tested during otolaryngological surgery and in anaesthesia procedures. Data were collected through an online survey to assess the feedback of operators. pO(2) and pCO(2) monitoring values during procedures were recorded in selected cases. RESULTS: All five MFFSM tested were easy to use and gave all operators a sound “feeling” of protection. All clinicians involved had common agreement regarding safety and the user-friendly format. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, specific development of different type of masks for protection in the operating room, intensive care units and/or office will be possible as a joint venture between clinicians and developers. Goals for clinicians include better definition of needs and priorities, while developers can devote their expertise to produce devices that meet medical requirements.","Vicini, Claudio; Cammaroto, Giovanni; Meccariello, Giuseppe; Iannella, Giannicola; Fragale, Marco; Cacco, Tommaso; Sampieri, Claudio; Guastini, Luca; Castello, Eolo; Parrinello, Giampiero; De Vito, Andrea; Gulotta, Giampiero; Visconti, Irene Claudia; Abita, Pietro; Pelucchi, Stefano; Bianchi, Giulia; Melegatti, Michela Nicole; Garulli, Gianluca; Bosco, Filippo; Gennaiotti, Alessandro; Berrettini, Stefano; Magnani, Massimo; Troncossi, Marco; Peretti, Giorgio",Acta Otorhinolaryngol Ital,169,26

While increased CXCL17 expression is associated with disease progression in pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung/hepatic cancer, it is thought to play a protective role in pancreatic cancer, autoimmune encephalomyelitis and viral infections. Thus, there is emerging evidence pointing to both a harmful and protective role for CXCL17 in human health and disease, with therapeutic potential for translational applications.

Lesions affecting the neurological, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and reproductive systems are most often observed. The control of ND must include strict biosecurity that prevents virulent NDV from contacting poultry, and also proper administration of efficacious vaccines. When administered correctly to healthy birds, ND vaccines formulated with NDV of low virulence or viral-vectored vaccines that express the NDV fusion protein are able to prevent clinical disease and mortality in chickens upon infection with virulent NDV. Live and inactivated vaccines have been widely used since the 1950’s. Recombinant and antigenically matched vaccines have been adopted recently in some countries, and many other vaccine approaches have been only evaluated experimentally. Despite decades of research and development towards formulation of an optimal ND vaccine, improvements are still needed. Impediments to prevent outbreaks include uneven vaccine application when using mass administration techniques in larger commercial settings, the difficulties associated with vaccinating free-roaming, multi-age birds of village flocks, and difficulties maintaining the cold chain to preserve the thermo-labile antigens in the vaccines. Incomplete or improper immunization often results in the disease and death of poultry after infection with virulent NDV. Another cause of decreased vaccine efficacy is the existence of antibodies (including maternal) in birds, which can neutralize the vaccine and thereby reduce the effectiveness of ND vaccines. In this review, a historical perspective, summary of the current situation for ND and NDV strains, and a review of traditional and experimental ND vaccines are presented.","Dimitrov, Kiril M.; Afonso, Claudio L.; Yu, Qingzhong; Miller, Patti J.",Vet Microbiol,169,5

Here, we attempted to compare thiol, total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), and oxidative stress index (OSI) levels between COVID-19 patients who need and do not need intensive care unit (ICU) support, and determine whether these markers could be used as predictors of ICU admission. METHODS: We recruited 86 patients with COVID-19 infection and classified them into two groups according to the level of care: ICU group (n = 40) and non-ICU group (n = 46). Thiol, TAS, TOS, and OSI levels were determined and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The levels of thiol and TAS in serum were markedly lower in ICU patients than in the non-ICU patients. On the contrary, TOS and OSI levels were markedly higher. Inflammatory markers, including white blood cell, neutrophil, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and ferritin, were negatively correlated with the thiol and TAS, and positively correlated with the TOS and OSI. We determined that areas under the ROC curve for thiol, TAS, TOS, and OSI were 0.799, 0.778, 0.713, and 0.780, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that the increase in oxidative stress and decrease in antioxidant levels in COVID-19-infected patients were associated with worsening of disease. Thiol, TAS, TOS, and OSI parameters can be used to distinguish between ICU patients and those who do not, among which thiol was the best predictor of ICU requirement.","Çakırca, Gökhan; Çakırca, Tuba Damar; Üstünel, Murat; Torun, Ayşe; Koyuncu, İsmail",Ir J Med Sci,169,14

Traditionally, immunoscreenings of expression libraries via polyclonal sera on nitrocellulose membranes or screenings of whole proteome lysates in 2-D gel electrophoresis are performed. However, these methods feature some rather inconvenient disadvantages. Screening of expression libraries to expose novel antigens from bacteria often lead to an abundance of false positive signals owing to the high cross reactivity of polyclonal antibodies towards the proteins of the expression host. A method is presented that overcomes many disadvantages of the old procedures. RESULTS: Four proteins that have previously been described as immunogenic have successfully been assessed immunogenic abilities with our method. One protein with no known immunogenic behaviour before suggested potential immunogenicity. We incorporated a fusion tag prior to our genes of interest and attached the expressed fusion proteins covalently on microarrays. This enhances the specific binding of the proteins compared to nitrocellulose. Thus, it helps to reduce the number of false positives significantly. It enables us to screen for immunogenic proteins in a shorter time, with more samples and statistical reliability. We validated our method by employing several known genes from Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168. CONCLUSIONS: The method presented offers a new approach for screening of bacterial expression libraries to illuminate novel proteins with immunogenic features. It could provide a powerful and attractive alternative to existing methods and help to detect and identify vaccine candidates, biomarkers and potential virulence-associated factors with immunogenic behaviour furthering the knowledge of virulence and pathogenicity of studied bacteria.","Hoppe, Sebastian; Bier, Frank F; von Nickisch-Rosenegk, Markus",J Nanobiotechnology,169,33

In retrospective cohort studies, use of famotidine, a specific oral H2 receptor antagonist (antihistamine), has been associated with reduced risk of intubation and death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. In a case series, non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 experienced rapid symptom resolution after taking famotidine, but the molecular basis of these observations remains elusive. Here we show using biochemical, cellular, and functional assays that famotidine has no effect on viral replication or viral protease activity. However, famotidine can affect histamine-induced signaling processes in infected Caco2 cells. Specifically, famotidine treatment inhibits histamine-induced expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and can reduce TLR3-dependent signaling processes that culminate in activation of IRF3 and the NF-κB pathway, subsequently controlling anti-viral and inflammatory responses. SARS-CoV-2-infected cells treated with famotidine demonstrate reduced expression levels of the inflammatory mediators CCL-2 and IL6, drivers of the cytokine release syndrome that precipitates poor outcome for patients with COVID-19. Given that pharmacokinetic studies indicate that famotidine can reach concentrations in blood that suffice to antagonize histamine H2 receptors expressed in mast cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils these observations explain how famotidine may contribute to the reduced histamine-induced inflammation and cytokine release, thereby improving the outcome for patients with COVID-19.","Mukherjee, Rukmini; Bhattacharya, Anshu; Bojkova, Denisa; Mehdipour, Ahmad Reza; Shin, Donghyuk; Khan, Khadija Shahed; Hei-Yin Cheung, Hayley; Wong, Kam-Bo; Ng, WaiLung; Cinatl, Jindrich; Geurink, Paul P.; van der Heden van Noort, Gerbrand J.; Rajalingam, Krishnaraj; Ciesek, Sandra; Hummer, Gerhard; Dikic, Ivan",J Biol Chem,169,10

However, there is a dearth of literature exploring family experiences of—or concerns related to—childhood vaccinations that gives voice to vaccine hesitant caregivers (VHCs) of small children. Here, we present insights from VHCs from the Philippines. METHODS: This research draws on in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 44 VHCs who had previously delayed or refused vaccination for their children in rural and urban communities in Cavite Province, the Philippines. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted IDIs via an online platform of the respondents’ choosing (ie, Facebook messenger call, Skype and Zoom). All interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated and analysed drawing from the tenets of constructivist grounded theory. We use the social ecological model to structure our results. RESULTS: Among the reasons for delay or refusal of childhood vaccinations, a fear of side effects emerged as the most salient concern, exacerbated by previous negative experiences (including trauma) from a dengue vaccine controversy in 2017. Respondents cited the dengue vaccine controversy as they expressed reluctance (regarding any new vaccines) and suspicion (towards school-based vaccination, the distribution channel used for the dengue vaccine). Heads of households opposing vaccines, perceptions that vaccines are non-essential and influences from the social and traditional media or neighbours contributed to further refusal and delay. Upon probing, VHCs recounted health system concerns particularly with regards to healthcare workers who are sometimes unable to answer their questions and can be dismissive or disrespectful regarding caregivers’ concerns. CONCLUSION: Understanding VH from the lens of VHCs highlights pathways for interventions to regain trust and bolster confidence towards vaccines. Our findings may serve as linchpins in the development of VH interventions aiming at changing behaviour on a population scale.","Landicho-Guevarra, Jhoys; Reñosa, Mark Donald C; Wachinger, Jonas; Endoma, Vivienne; Aligato, Mila F; Bravo, Thea Andrea; Landicho, Jeniffer; Bärnighausen, Kate; McMahon, Shannon A",BMJ Glob Health,169,16

The assessment was carried out by conducting a geospatial analysis of tourism establishments at risk using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We combined the geospatial analysis with publicly available databases to assess the integrated climate-related impacts pertaining to a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) economy. Our study estimated that many tourism properties currently lie in a storm surge zone and the extent of properties at risk increases with a future scenario of a 1 m rise in sea level. While sea level rise (SLR) by itself only threatens a small number of properties, when combined with weak (Category 1), moderate (Category 3) and strong (Category 5) storms the resulting coastal flooding impacts 34%, 69%, and 83% of the tourism infrastructure (hotels and resorts), respectively. In addition to flooding, properties are also susceptible to coastal erosion with 28% of the total hotels and resorts on the two islands being situated within 0–50 m and 60% of the tourism infrastructure within 0–100 m of the coastline. Considering the economic importance of the sector, the potential impacts on the tourism infrastructure will cause significant losses in revenue and employment for the two islands. Furthermore, the majority of the tourism on these islands is beach-based and visitor expenditures will decline due to their vulnerability. These losses will have far-reaching social-economic consequences for the Bahamas.

Information on the school opening delay and re-opening policies were achieved from the press release from Korean Ministry of Education. Findings The school openings were delayed three times in March 2020. Online classes started from April 9, and off-line classes started from May 20 to June 8 at four steps in different grades of students. There was no sudden increase in pediatric cases after the school opening, and the proportion of pediatric cases remained around 7.0% to 7.1%. As of July 11, 45 children from 40 schools and kindergartens were diagnosed with COVID-19 after off-line classes started.

These emerging infectious diseases threaten global public health and raise urgent studies on unraveling the underlying mechanisms of their transmission from animals to humans. Although numerous works have intensively discussed the cross-species and endemic barriers to the occurrence and spread of emerging infectious diseases, both types of barriers play synergistic roles in wildlife habitats. Thus far, there is still a lack of a complete understanding of viral diffusion, migration, and transmission in ecosystems from a macro perspective. In this review, we conceptualize the ecological barrier that represents the combined effects of cross-species and endemic barriers for either the natural or intermediate hosts of viruses. We comprehensively discuss the key influential factors affecting the ecological barrier against viral transmission from virus hosts in their natural habitats into human society, including transmission routes, contact probability, contact frequency, and viral characteristics. Considering the significant impacts of human activities and global industrialization on the strength of the ecological barrier, ecological barrier deterioration driven by human activities is critically analyzed for potential mechanisms. Global climate change can trigger and expand the range of emerging infectious diseases, and human disturbances promote higher contact frequency and greater transmission possibility. In addition, globalization drives more transmission routes and produces new high-risk regions in city areas. This review aims to provide a new concept for and comprehensive evidence of the ecological barrier blocking the transmission and spread of emerging infectious diseases. It also offers new insights into potential strategies to protect the ecological barrier and reduce the wide-ranging risks of emerging infectious diseases to public health.","Zhang, Dayi; Yang, Yunfeng; Li, Miao; Lu, Yun; Liu, Yi; Jiang, Jingkun; Liu, Ruiping; Liu, Jianguo; Huang, Xia; Li, Guanghe; Qu, Jiuhui",Engineering (Beijing),169,1

To investigate whether cyclophilin A (CypA) can up-regulate the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in monocytes/macrophages and whether CD147 facilitates this regulation in RA. Methods. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from RA patients and differentiated into macrophages by M-CSF (15 ng/ml). Under CypA stimulation (200 ng/ml), the protein release and activation of MMPs were detected by gelatin zymography and invasion assay. Human monocyte cell line THP-1 cells were selected for the advanced searching for potential interaction between CypA and CD147 in production of MMPs and cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM). Results. CypA significantly increased production and activation of MMP-9, not MMP-2, in the monocytes/macrophages derived from RA SF. CSA and HAb18G/CD147 antagonistic peptide AP-9 against CD147, respectively, dramatically decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression, both in the absence or presence of CypA. Similar effects of CypA on MMP-9 production and cell invasion were observed in THP-1 cells. CypA-induced nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity for MMP-9 transcription were strongly blocked by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun amino terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitors (U0126 and SP600125, respectively), but not by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors (SB203580). CypA also induced calcium mobilization and increased the adhesion of THP-1 cells to ECM. Conclusions. These findings suggest that in RA, the abundant CypA, by its direct binding to CD147, up-regulates MMP-9 expression and adhesion of monocytes/macrophages to ECM, and the cyclophilin-CD147 interactions might contribute to the destruction of cartilage and bone.","Yang, Y.; Lu, N.; Zhou, J.; Chen, Z.-n.; Zhu, P.",Rheumatology (Oxford),169,5

METHODS: During the early months of the pandemic, we undertook a rapid review, asking: what are the principles adopted by professional ethical guidance in England and Wales for dealing with COVID-19? We undertook thematic content analysis of the 29 documents that met our inclusion criteria. RESULTS: The 29 documents captured 13 overlapping principles: respect, fairness, minimising harm, reciprocity, proportionality, flexibility, working together, inclusiveness, communication, transparency, reasonableness, responsibility, and accountability. CONCLUSIONS: We intend this attempt to collate and outline the prominent principles to be helpful, particularly, for healthcare practice during the COVID-19 pandemic and, hopefully, for future pandemic planning. We also offer some reflections on the guidance and the principles therein. After describing the principles, we reflect on some of the similarities and differences in the guidance, and the challenges associated not only with the specific guidance reviewed, but also with the nature and import of “professional ethical guidance”.","Smith, Helen; Coulson-Smith, Peta; Kennedy, Mari-Rose; Birchley, Giles; Ives, Jonathan; Huxtable, Richard",BMC Med Ethics,169,1

Additionally, the protection efficacy of several commercially available masks from such aerosols was assessed in a pilot study. METHODS: Twenty-six subjects were debonded during aerosol sampling, by using an innovative collection system to harvest bonding dust liberated during debonding. Dark-field microscopy, gram-stain microscopy, and chemical identification were used to determine speciation of the collected aerosol from 23 subjects. Three additional subjects were used to test 3 commercial dental or protective masks to determine whether they provide effective protection from the aerosol. RESULTS: Twenty-one species of oral bacteria were identified by the new sampling technique. Two of the 3 masks that were tested offered no protection against the aerosolized bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: A new and effective method for collecting airborne bacteria is presented. Some conventional dental masks offer no protection from aerosolized organisms liberated during debonding procedures. Further assessment of mask efficacy is ongoing.","Greco, Peter M.; Lai, Chern-Hsiung",Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop,169,16

These airway teams were implemented in various hospitals around the world to respond to the acute increase of critical ill patients requiring ventilatory support. We created a financial model to estimate the costs for staffing and maintaining a dedicated COVID-19 airway response team based on the experience at an urban academic hospital in the Northeastern United States between March and June of 2020. Methods: The institutional review board at Brigham and Women's Hospital approved this protocol and the requirement for informed consent was waived. The average reimbursement for 125 COVID-19 airway consultations was measured. Our team estimated the costs of consumable items for each airway based on previously published recommendations for equipment and personal protective equipment. A sensitivity analyses was performed for variable numbers of monthly airway consults and different staffing patterns based on a literature review of available COVID-19 airway team structures. Results: Based on the average reimbursements and estimates of the consumable costs, each airway procedure represented a net loss of $34 to the institution. The overall estimated cost of staffing a dedicated airway team was between $109,472 and $204,575 per month. Conclusions: Development and implementation of a dedicated COVID-19 airway response teams represents a significant institutional expense. Institutions should establish necessary cost sharing, consider volume and team structure, and identify reimbursement opportunities that mitigate the necessary expense associated with airway response programs.","Stone, Alexander B.; Grant, Michael C.; Dasani, Serena S.; Nascimben, Luigino",Perioper Care Oper Room Manag,169,29

Pediatric populations are less impacted than adults, and critical respiratory diseases seem rare (1, 2). We report the case of an infant, who presented with life-threatening apneas at home requiring basic life support. SARS-CoV-2 was subsequently identified in the patient's nasopharyngeal aspirate. He did not present with bronchiolitis or hypoxic failure as described in severe forms of COVID−19. The outcome was favorable in a few hours. The occurrence of apneas is not uncommon during viral respiratory infections in early infancy; however, there are very few descriptions related to a documented SARS-CoV-2 respiratory tract infection. In light of this clinical case, it seems necessary to quickly bring up a potential COVID-19 contamination in infants admitted for life-threatening apnea, in order to properly report and isolate these patients to avoid further nosocomial dissemination of SARS-CoV-2.","Loron, Gauthier; Tromeur, Thibault; Venot, Perrine; Beck, Jonathan; Andreoletti, Laurent; Mauran, Pierre; Bednarek, Nathalie",Front Pediatr,169,20

It often results in subpar living conditions for a patient as they have to go through expensive and painful treatments to fight this cancer. One in eight women all over the world is affected by this disease. Almost half a million women annually do not survive this fight and die from this disease. Machine learning algorithms have proven to outperform all existing solutions for the prediction of breast cancer using models built on the previously available data. In this paper, a novel approach named BCD-WERT is proposed that utilizes the Extremely Randomized Tree and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) for efficient feature selection and classification. WOA reduces the dimensionality of the dataset and extracts the relevant features for accurate classification. Experimental results on state-of-the-art comprehensive dataset demonstrated improved performance in comparison with eight other machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Kernel Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gaussian Naive Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbor. BCD-WERT outperformed all with the highest accuracy rate of 99.30% followed by SVM achieving 98.60% accuracy.

Two consecutively negative SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA test ( interval ≥ 24 hours), improved respiratory symptoms and obvious absorption of inflammation in pulmonary imaging are the discharge criteria for COVID-19 patients. The clearance profile of viral RNA in the upper respiratory tract specimens, including nasopharyngeal swab and/or oropharyngeal swabs, is related to innate immune cells such as Natural Killer cells. A total of 168 patients were included for the study. In this cohort, non-severe and severe groups showed significant differences in white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, basophils and platelets counts, as well as in infection related parameters such as CRP and serum cytokine IL-6. For lymphocyte subsets tests at admission, the severe group displayed significantly lower cell counts than the non-severe group. Higher counts of total T cells, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, and NK cells in peripheral blood showed a significant correlation with the shorter time taken to obtain the first negative viral RNA test and first positive IgM/ IgG antibody test. The number of B cells was only correlated with time to achieve the first positive IgM/IgG test. The count of NK cells was also correlated with a higher level of IgG antibody (p = 0.025). The lymphocytopenia group had a significantly worse survival rate (p = 0.022) and a longer duration (p = 0.023) of viral shedding than the normal lymphocyte count group. A lower NK cell count correlates the most with the worse survival rate (p<0.001) and a longer duration (p<0.001) of viral shedding. This study suggests the potential value of allo-Natural Killer cell therapy as an universal COVID-19 treatment strategy.","Bao, Changqian; Tao, Xiandong; Cui, Wei; Hao, Yuanyuan; Zheng, Shuaike; Yi, Bin; Pan, Tiewen; Young, Ken H.; Qian, Wenbin",Exp Hematol Oncol,169,24

We developed a spatially-explicit agent-based model for simulating indoor respiratory pathogen transmission, and used it to compare effects of four interventions on reducing individual-level SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk by simulating a well-known case study. We found that imposing movement restrictions and efficacious mask usage appear to have the greatest effects on reducing infection risk, but multiple concurrent interventions are required to minimize the proportion of susceptible individuals infected. Social distancing had little effect on reducing transmission if individuals move during the gathering. Furthermore, our results suggest that there is potential for ventilation airflow to expose susceptible people to aerosolized pathogens even if they are relatively far from infectious individuals. Maximizing rates of aerosol removal is the key to successful transmission-risk reduction when using ventilation systems as intervention tools.","Farthing, Trevor S.; Lanzas, Cristina",medRxiv,169,6

AIMS: We aimed to characterize the adverse skin reactions occurring after hand hygiene and glove use in HCWs in a tertiary university hospital to determine the possible causative factors and whether the use of these measures is affected. METHODS: Between 15 April and 1 May 2020, a cross‐sectional survey was conducted, using on‐line questionnaire, answered by HCWs in a tertiary university hospital. RESULTS: The increase in general hand skin problems during the pandemic period was statistically significant (p = 0.004). The most common symptom was dryness. During the pandemic period, 67 (24.3%) HCWs thought that the conditions were caused by glove use, 197 (71.4%) thought that they were due to alcohol‐based hand antiseptics. The incidence of other hand‐skin conditions except for vesicles was statistically higher in women than in men (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increased number of hand‐skin conditions during the pandemic should not be ignored, since hand hygiene and glove use are expected to increase.","Altunisik Toplu, Sibel; Altunisik, Nihal; Turkmen, Dursun; Ersoy, Yasemin",J Cosmet Dermatol,169,1

First, the accumulation of environmentally significant levels of feces-associated and monodispersed poliovirus by oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) was investigated. The results of this study suggested that virus accumulation by mollusks may not be significant when water column concentrations are below ⋍0.01 plaque-forming units (PFU) per milliliter. The second study focused on the relative contributions of undisturbed sediments versus those in the water column in the accumulation of viruses by epifaunal and infaunal shellfish (C. virginica and M. mercenaria). Viruses were found to be most efficiently accumulated when suspended in the water column.","Vaughn, James M.; Landry, Edward F.",Aquaculture,169,27

This study aimed to determine the effect of ACEI/ARB use in patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was done in two Saudi public specialty hospitals designated as COVID-19 referral facilities. We included 354 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between April and June 2020, of which 146 were ACEI/ARB users and 208 were non-ACEI/ARB users. Controlling for confounders, we conducted multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses using propensity score matching (PSM) and Inverse propensity score weighting (IPSW) for high-risk patient subsets. RESULTS: Compared to non-ACEI/ARB users, ACEI/ARB users had an eight-fold higher risk of developing critical or severe COVID-19 (OR = 8.25, 95%CI = 3.32-20.53); a nearly 7-fold higher risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR = 6.76, 95%CI = 2.88-15.89) and a nearly 5-fold higher risk of requiring noninvasive ventilation (OR = 4.77,95%CI = 2.15-10.55).

However, no cross‐neutralization is observed in polyclonal antibody responses raised after virus infection or immunization with purified F proteins. Based on crystal structures of hRSV F and hMPV F, we designed chimeric F proteins in which certain residues of well‐characterized antigenic sites were swapped between the two antigens. The antigenic changes were monitored by ELISA with virus‐specific monoclonal antibodies. Inoculation of mice with these chimeras induced polyclonal cross‐neutralizing antibody responses, and mice were protected against challenge with the virus used for grafting of the heterologous antigenic site.

Findings The post-vaccine levels of spike-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 wild type and all three variants of concern were similar or higher in participants receiving a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine post SARS-CoV-2 infection (both < 11 months post infection (n=37) and [≥] 11 months infection (n=46)) compared to participants who received two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine (n=149). Interpretation Our data support that a single dose ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine serves as an effective immune booster after priming with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection up to at least 11 months post infection.","Havervall, S.; Marking, U.; Greilert-Norin, N.; Ng, H.; Salomonsson, A.-C.; Hellstrom, C.; Pin, E.; Blom, K.; Mangsbo, S.; Phillipson, M.; Klingstrom, J.; Aberg, M.; Hober, S.; Nilsson, P.; Thalin, C.",,169,20

To evaluate the DES of doctors and nurses worked at front-line hospitals with protective glasses for a mean time of 4 to 6 hours, a questionnaire developed by the researchers with the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) was used. These data were evaluated using descriptive statistics and correlation test with SPSS 22.0. The study included 13 doctors and 40 nurses, among which 16 were male and 37 were female, and the mean age of the participants was 32.43 ± 5.15 years old. According to the OSDI scores, 64.15, 24.52, 7.54, and 3.77% of the participants experienced occasional, mild, moderate, and severe DES, respectively. The factors significantly correlated with OSDI scores were age and duration of wearing protective glasses, while the duration of wearing protective glasses may be a protective factor of dry eye symptoms. Our study showed that most of the doctors and nurses worked at the front-line of combating COVID-19 did not experience DES, while the symptoms of those who experienced DES might be improved by wearing protective glasses.","Long, Yan; Wang, XiaWei; Tong, Qian; Xia, JianHua; Shen, Ye",Medicine (Baltimore),169,1

Telemedicine has been proposed to improve access. Introduction: The objective of this study was to identify predictors of telemedicine use for chronic disease specialty care in the Alaska Tribal Health System. Materials and Methods: We collected data from patients and providers about benefits, barriers, and deciding factors for or against telemedicine use. Participants were recruited from three regional tribal health organizations in Alaska during 2019. Data were collected using a patient survey, a provider survey, and patient focus groups. Results: Of the 153 patients surveyed, 104 had never used telemedicine, and 71 (68% of never users) were open to it if offered. Of the 29 providers surveyed, 27 (93%) stated a preference for using telemedicine in the follow-up phase of care. In the focus groups conducted with telemedicine ever users (n = 23) and never users (n = 14), the identified barriers and benefits were similar, but never users were more likely to emphasize patient preference as a deciding factor, whereas ever users described clinic-related deciding factors more commonly. Relationship building before telemedicine visits was identified as important by some focus group participants. Discussion: This study adds to the literature on patient and provider views of benefits, barriers, and deciding factors for or against the use of telemedicine before the COVID-19 pandemic. These views may evolve over time. Conclusions: Patients and providers identify benefits of telemedicine that may outweigh the barriers in many settings.","Ferucci, Elizabeth D; Choromanski, Tammy L; Arnold, Rabecca I; Richards, Jaclynne K; Jessen, Cornelia M",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,169,26

The present study retrospectively evaluated the prevalence and distribution of lung perfusion defects in early post-COVID-19 patients with hypoxia and was aimed to identify the risk factors for mismatched perfusion defects. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) of 54 early post-COVID-19 patients (male: 44). Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk. Results: The mean age of the study population was 55.4 years (range: 34 to 76). All received prophylactic anticoagulation from the day of hospitalization to the date of perfusion scan. The median interval between COVID-19 positive report and lung perfusion scan was 22 days. Perfusion defects in lungs (of any type) were observed in 47 subjects (87%). Twenty-three subjects (42.6%) had mismatched perfusion defects. Mismatched defects were segmental in 14 (25.9%) and subsegmental in 11 (20.4%) subjects. Older age is at a higher risk for mismatched perfusion defects (Odds ratio: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.99-1.13, P = 0.06). The subjects' serum D-dimer ≥2500 ng/ml before the scan was not at higher risk for mismatched perfusion defects (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.34-3.9, P = 0.83). Conclusion: Despite prophylactic anticoagulation, the mismatched defects, suggestive of pulmonary thromboembolism were observed. Serum D-dimer in early post-COVID-19 is a poor predictor of mismatched perfusion defects. Confirmed evidence of pulmonary embolism by imaging studies should support the decision to extend anticoagulant prophylaxis.","De, Sajal; Ravina, Mudalsha; Lukose, Tinu; G, Ranganath T; Sahu, Dibakar",Journal of nuclear medicine technology,169,16

The objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of telemedicine-based palliative interventions in cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary care centre with 547 follow-up patients who used palliative medicine teleconsultation services. The following data were retrieved from the records: Patient’s reason for the call, the main barriers to a hospital visit, the assistance given to them by the physician on the call and the patients’ satisfaction with the service on a 4-point scale. The data were analysed using percentages for categorical variables and mean/standard deviation for quantitative variables. RESULTS: Out of the 547 patients, 462 (84.46%) utilised voice calling service, and the major reason for not visiting the hospital were cited to be fear of contracting COVID-19 (37.3%), inability to attend due to health constraints (7.13%) and issues with transportation (48.8%). The majority of the calls (63.62%) calls were regarding uncontrolled symptoms of the primary diseases. A total of 402 (73.49%) patients were very satisfied, and a total of 399 (72.94%) decided to continue to use this medium in the future as well. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine is a good modality for the assessment of chronic pain and providing symptomatic supportive care in patients with cancer in the COIVD-19 pandemic.","Adhikari, Shreya Das; Biswas, Swagata; Mishra, Seema; Kumar, Vinod; Bharti, Sachidanand Jee; Gupta, Nishkarsh; Garg, Rakesh; Bhatnagar, Sushma",Indian J Palliat Care,169,9

The correct position of the marker was documented by mammography after its placement and by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Migration of the marker to the nipple was evident only by mammography on the day of surgery. We hypothesized that an intraductal path was the route of marker migration in this patient. Marked ductal ectasia evident on MRI and histopathologic examination supported this hypothesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published case of intraductal migration of a breast tissue marker.","Andrade, Gisela; Pereira, André; Gonçalves, Lucília; Videira, Cláudia",J Breast Cancer,169,29

Drawing on the regulatory loop model of loneliness, the notions of Internet Paradox, the Time Displacement hypothesis and previous literature on WeChat use intensity, we propose that lockdown loneliness (partially) mediates the relationship between lockdown WeChat use intensity and well-being (i.e., lockdown stress and lockdown life satisfaction). Moreover, we assume that lockdown WeChat use intensity moderates the relationship between lockdown social isolation and well-being (i.e., lockdown stress and lockdown life satisfaction) in both a direct and in an indirect way, that is through lockdown loneliness. The results from our Structural Equation Modeling analyses, using a sample of 1,805 Chinese respondents, indicate that all of our research hypotheses are confirmed. From this empirical work, it becomes clear that online social interactions, which are believed by many people to be able to compensate for the lack of offline social interactions during the COVID-19 lockdown period, in fact are endangering their mental health and life satisfaction instead.

Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) by nucleotide analogs provides a promising antiviral strategy. One common group of RdRp inhibitors, 2'-modified nucleotides, are reported to exhibit different behaviors in the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp transcription assay. Three of these analogs, 2'-O-methyl UTP, Sofosbuvir, and 2'-methyl CTP, act as effective inhibitors in previous biochemical experiments, while Gemcitabine and ara-UTP show no inhibitory activity. To understand the impact of the 2'-modification on their inhibitory effects, we conducted extensive molecular dynamics simulations and relative binding free energy calculations using the free energy perturbation method on SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex (RTC) with these five nucleotide analogs. Our results reveal that the five nucleotide analogs display comparable binding affinities to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and they can all be added to the nascent RNA chain. Moreover, we examine how the incorporation of these nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) analogs will impact the addition of the next nucleotide. Our results indicate that 2'-O-methyl UTP can weaken the binding of the subsequent NTP and consequently lead to partial chain termination. Additionally, Sofosbuvir and 2'-methyl CTP can cause immediate termination due to the strong steric hindrance introduced by their bulky 2'-methyl groups. In contrast, nucleotide analogs with smaller substitutions, such as the fluorine atoms and the ara-hydroxyl group in Gemcitabine and ara-UTP, have a marginal impact on the polymerization process. Our findings are consistent with experimental observations, and more importantly, shed light on the detailed molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibition by 2'-substituted nucleotide analogs, and may facilitate the rational design of antiviral agents to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.","Yuan, Congmin; Goonetilleke, Eshani C; Unarta, Ilona Christy; Huang, Xuhui",Phys Chem Chem Phys,169,12

To date, however, no effective treatments or enough vaccines for COVID-19 are available. The roles of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and spike protein in the treatment of COVID-19 are major areas of research. In this study, we explored the potential of ACE2 and spike protein as targets for the development of antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed clinical data, genetic data, and receptor binding capability. Clinical data revealed that COVID-19 patients with comorbidities related to an abnormal renin-angiotensin system exhibited more early symptoms and poorer prognoses. However, the relationship between ACE2 expression and COVID-19 progression is still not clear. Furthermore, if ACE2 is not a good targetable protein, it would not be applicable across a wide range of populations. The spike-S1 receptor-binding domain that interacts with ACE2 showed various amino acid mutations based on sequence analysis. We identified two spike-S1 point mutations (V354F and V470A) by receptor-ligand docking and binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. These variants enhanced the binding of the spike protein to ACE2 receptors and were potentially associated with increased infectivity. Importantly, the number of patients infected with the V354F and V470A mutants has increased with the development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These results suggest that ACE2 and spike-S1 are likely not ideal targets for the design of peptide drugs to treat COVID-19 in different populations.","Shu, Chuan-Jun; Huang, Xuan; Tang, Hui-Hao; Mo, Ding-Ding; Zhou, Jian-Wei; Deng, Cheng",Zool Res,169,6

We recently showed that this platform is highly inflammatory due to the LNPs’ ionizable lipid component. The inflammatory property is key to support the development of potent humoral immune responses. However, the mechanism by which this platform drives T follicular helper cells (Tfh) and humoral immune responses remains unknown. Here we show that lack of Langerhans cells or cDC1s neither significantly affected the induction of PR8 HA and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific Tfh cells and humoral immune responses, nor susceptibility towards the lethal challenge of influenza and SARS-CoV-2. However, the combined deletion of these two DC subsets led to a significant decrease in the induction of PR8 HA and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific Tfh cell and humoral immune responses. Despite these observed defects, the still high antibody titers were sufficient to confer protection towards lethal viral challenges. We further found that IL-6, but not neutrophils, was required to generate Tfh cells and antibody responses. In summary, here we bring evidence that the mRNA-LNP platform can support protective adaptive immune responses in the absence of specific DC subsets through an IL-6 dependent and neutrophil independent mechanism.","Ndeupen, Sonia; Bouteau, Aurélie; Herbst, Christopher; Qin, Zhen; Hutchins, Zachary; Kurup, Drishya; Diba, Leila Zabihi; Igyártó, Botond Z.",bioRxiv,169,1

Tissue factor (TF) is the primary cellular initiator of coagulation. Most of the TF expressed on cell surfaces remains cryptic. Sphingomyelin (SM) is responsible for maintaining TF in the encrypted state, and hydrolysis of SM by acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) increases TF activity. ASMase was shown to play a role in virus infection biology. In the present study, we investigated the role of ASMase in SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced TF procoagulant activity. Infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) with SARs-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus (SARS-CoV-2-SP-PV) markedly increased TF procoagulant activity at the cell surface and released TF+ extracellular vesicles (EVs). The pseudovirus infection did not increase either TF protein expression or phosphatidylserine externalization. SARS-CoV-2-SP-PV infection induced the translocation of ASMase to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, which led to the hydrolysis of SM in the membrane. Pharmacological inhibitors or genetic silencing of ASMase attenuated SARS-CoV-2-SP-PV-induced increased TF activity. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, attenuated SARS-CoV-2-SP-PV-induced increased TF activity. Overall, our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection activates the coagulation by decrypting TF through activation of ASMase.

DESIGN: Observational study with retrospective analysis of data. METHODS: Participants were trained in the correct use of the app (Alleye, Oculocare, Zurich, Switzerland) in person or by using video and telephone consultations. Automated threshold-based alerts were communicated based on a traffic light system. A ‘threshold alarm’ was defined as three consecutive ‘red’ scores, and turned into a ‘persistent alarm’ if present for greater than a 7-day period. Changes of VA and CMT, and the requirement for intravitreal therapy after an alarm were examined. RESULTS: 245 patients performing a total of 11 592 tests (mean 46.9 tests per user) were included and 85 eyes (164 alarms) examined. Mean drop in VA from baseline was −4.23 letters (95% CI: −6.24 to −2.22; p<0.001) and mean increase in CMT was 29.5 µm (95% CI: −0.08 to 59.13; p=0.051).

This study developed a Markov chain model for quickly obtaining the information on the basis of a steady-state flow field calculated by computational fluid dynamics. When solving the particle transport equations, the Markov chain model does not require iterations in each time step, and thus it can significantly reduce the computing cost. This study used two sets of experimental data for transient particle transport to validate the model. In general, the trends in the particle concentration distributions predicted by the Markov chain model agreed reasonably well with the experimental data. This investigation also applied the model to the calculation of person-to-person particle transport in a ventilated room. The Markov chain model produced similar results to those of the Lagrangian and Eulerian models, while the speed of calculation increased by 8.0 and 6.3 times, respectively, in comparison to the latter two models.","Chen, Chun; Liu, Wei; Lin, Chao-Hsin; Chen, Qingyan",Build Environ,169,20

We aimed to investigate the prevalence rate of insomnia and to confirm the related social psychological factors among medical staff in hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: Medical staff members in China were recruited, including frontline medical workers. The questionnaire, administered through the WeChat program, obtained demographic data and asked self-design questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, insomnia/depressive/anxiety symptoms, and stress-related symptoms. We used a logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors and insomnia symptoms. RESULT: There were a total of 1,563 participants in our study. Five-hundred-and-sixty-four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score ≥ 8). A multiple binary logistic regression model revealed that insomnia symptoms were associated with an education level of high school or below (OR = 2.69, p = 0.042, 95% CI = 1.0–7.0), being a doctor (OR = 0.44, p = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.2–0.8), currently working in an isolation unit (OR = 1.71, p = 0.038, 95% CI = 1.0–2.8), is worried about being infected (OR = 2.30, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 1.6–3.4), perceived lack of helpfulness in terms of psychological support from news or social media with regard to COVID-19 (OR = 2.10, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.3–3.3), and having very strong uncertainty regarding effective disease control (OR = 3.30, p = 0.013, 95% CI = 1.3–8.5). CONCLUSION: Our study found that more than one-third of the medical staff suffered insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. The related factors included education level, an isolation environment, psychological worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, and being a doctor. Interventions for insomnia among medical staff are needed considering the various sociopsychological factors at play in this situation.","Zhang, Chenxi; Yang, Lulu; Liu, Shuai; Ma, Simeng; Wang, Ying; Cai, Zhongxiang; Du, Hui; Li, Ruiting; Kang, Lijun; Su, Meilei; Zhang, Jihui; Liu, Zhongchun; Zhang, Bin",Front Psychiatry,169,1

However, the function of the (G)-G-G-D and K-D-K-E motifs in the NNS RNA virus Newcastle disease virus (NDV) remains unclear. We observed G-G-D and K-D-K-E motifs in all NDV genotypes. By using the infection cloning system of NDV rSG10 strain, recombinant NDVs with a single amino acid mutated to alanine in one motif (G-G-D or K-D-K-E) were rescued. The intracerebral pathogenicity index and mean death time assay results revealed that the G-G-D motif and K-D-K-E motif attenuate the virulence of NDV to various degrees. The replication, transcription, and translation levels of the K-D-K-E motif-mutant strains were significantly higher than those of wild-type virus owing to their altered regulation of the affinity between nucleocapsid protein and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E. When the infection dose was changed from a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 to an MOI of 0.01, the cell-to-cell spread abilities of G-G-D- and K-D-K-E-mutant strains were reduced, according to plaque assay and dynamic indirect immunofluorescence assay results. Finally, we found that NDV strains with G-G-D or K-D-K-E motif mutations had less pathogenicity in 3-week-old specific-pathogen-free chickens than wild-type NDV. Therefore, these methyltransferase motifs can affect virulence by regulating the translation and cell-to-cell spread abilities of NDV. This work provides a feasible approach for generating vaccine candidates for viruses with methyltransferase motifs. IMPORTANCE Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is an important pathogen that is widespread globally. Research on its pathogenic mechanism is an important means of improving prevention and control efforts. Our study found that a deficiency in its methyltransferase motifs (G-G-D and K-D-K-E motifs) can attenuate NDV and revealed the molecular mechanism by which these motifs affect pathogenicity, which provides a new direction for the development of NDV vaccines. In addition to the (G)-G-G-D and K-D-K-E motifs of many nonsegmented, negative-stranded RNA viruses, similar motifs have been found in dengue virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This suggests that such motifs may be present in more viruses. Our finding also provides a molecular basis for the discovery and functional study of (G)-G-G-D and K-D-K-E motifs of other viruses.","Li, Xiao; Sun, Lu; Zhao, Jing; Tu, Kaihang; Xue, Jia; Guo, Xin; Zhang, Guozhong",Microbiol Spectr,169,12

METHODS: The patients’ demographic information, cancer history, treatment pattern, information about MERS-coronavirus (CoV) infection, history of travel, clinical symptoms, test results, and outcome were collected and analyzed as part of a quality improvement project to improve the care and safety of our patients. Only patients with confirmed infection were included. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients were identified, with a median age of 66 years (range, 16-88 years), and 12 patients (63%) were males. The most common underlying disease was hematologic malignancies (47.4%), followed by colorectal cancer (21%) and lung cancer (15.8%). Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common comorbidities (57.9% and 52.6%, respectively). Infection was diagnosed by nasopharyngeal swab in all patients. All patients contracted the infection during their hospitalization for other reasons. Sixteen patients (80%) were admitted to the intensive care unit; 13 patients (81%) had acute respiratory distress syndrome, 11 were intubated (68.75%), 9 had acute renal injury (56.25%), and 3 required dialysis (18.75%). Only 3 patients (15.8%) with early-stage cancers survived. Patients with hematologic malignancies and advanced solid tumors had a 100% case fatality rate. The majority of the causes of death were due to multi-organ failure and septic shock. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV infection resulted in a high case fatality rate in patients with malignancy. Therefore, it is critical to implement effective primary preventive measures to avoid exposure of patients with cancer to the virus.","Jazieh, Abdul-Rahman; Alenazi, Thamer H.; Alhejazi, Ayman; Al Safi, Faisal; Al Olayan, Ashwaq",JCO Glob Oncol,169,30

One approach to ensure relevancy and comprehensiveness of the criteria underpinning the decision is a broad societal discourse and participatory decision-making process. However, this often was not feasible within the time constraints imposed on by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While not able or intended to replace stakeholder participation, evidence-to-decision frameworks can serve as a tool to approach relevancy and comprehensiveness of the criteria considered, even if not all voices of affected stakeholders could be heard in the process. Objective: The objective of this research project was to develop a decision-making framework adapted to the challenges decision-makers face when deliberating on national and sub-national level on non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) measures to address the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: We used the WHO-INTEGRATE framework Version 1.0 as a starting point. In phase I, we adapted the framework through brainstorming exercises and application to exemplary case studies. In phase II, we used the best-fit framework synthesis technique with the output of phase I serving as a priori framework. We conducted a content analysis of comprehensive strategy documents intended to guide the policy makers on the phasing out of the lockdown measures in Germany. Based on factors and criteria identified in this process, we adapted previous versions into the WHO-INTEGRATE COVID framework (WICID framework) Version 1.0. Results: Twelve comprehensive strategy documents were included in the content analysis. The revised WICID framework consists of eleven criteria, which are expanded on through 49 aspects contained within them, and the metacriterion quality of evidence. The criteria cover implications for the health of individuals and populations due to and beyond COVID-19, infringement on liberties and fundamental rights, acceptability considerations, societal, environmental, and economic implications, as well as resource and feasibility considerations. Discussion: In a third phase, the framework will be expanded through a comprehensive document analysis focusing on key-stakeholder groups across the society. The WICID framework V1.0 can be a tool to support comprehensive evidence-informed decision-making processes.","Stratil, J. M.; Arnold, L.",,169,1

To assess the extent to which these effects are perceived as detrimental. Non-directional Hypothesis - the perception of physical and mental health will change over the duration of the eight weeks, due to the effects of the lockdown, as a result of COVID-19. DESIGN: This was a prospective longitudinal study evaluating the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown in the UK over the eight week period, against the political timeline during which the study was conducted (April 08, 2020–June 04, 2020). SETTING: Participants were all in secondary education, ranging from years 10–13 (ages 15–18). PARTICIPANTS: 55 volunteers have taken part in the study, the group of participants was mixed-sex and of different ethnic groups. Participants were chosen via an opportunity sampling method. All participants stem from a middle to high socioeconomic background. The target demographic of the study was teenagers in secondary education, so participants have been selected from a volunteer sample that is representative of this population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physical health and Mental health. RESULTS: Data obtained was synchronised with the political timeline over the eight week period, in order to provide specific interpretations for the findings of the study. Measures of physical health: Sleep with a median length of 8 ​h in comparison to seven before lockdown (SD between 1.236 and 1.835); 70.00% of participants experienced a decline in their physical health; Productivity amongst participants slightly decreased (76.70%–62.90%). The measures of mental health: Length of screen time, with a median length of 6 ​h in comparison to four before lockdown (SD between 1.48 and 3.3), however, it remained stagnant over the study period and participants did not experience a further increase; The number of hours spent on social media also increased, with an increasing number of participants spending over 4 ​h on social media; Conflicts increased in their family environment (from 25.60% to 37.10% of participants reporting more conflicts). During virtual school, conflict was at its lowest point (18.40%) and harmony in the family environment was at its highest peak (65.80%). 51.00% of participants relayed a decline in their mental health. A statistically significant correlation was found between exercise and creativity, both of which decreased over the study period (r(s) ​= ​0.42 is bigger than the critical value ​= ​0.22 when p ​= ​0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite certain positive effects, the overall impact of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic has been negative, regarding both physical and mental health, for this cohort of young people.","Jester, Noemi; Kang, Premjeet",Public Health Pract (Oxf),169,27

Such inflammatory responses coordinate host defense and pathogen elimination but induce significant tissue damage if sustained, so macrophages are initially activated to induce inflammatory responses but then shift to a tolerant state to suppress inflammatory responses. Macrophage tolerance is regulated by induction of negative regulators of TLR signaling, but its metabolic basis was not known. Here, we review recent studies that indicate that macrophage metabolism changes dynamically over the course of microbial exposure to influence a shift in the inflammatory response. In particular, an initial increase in oxidative metabolism boosts the induction of inflammatory responses, but is followed by a shutdown of oxidative metabolism that contributes to suppression of inflammatory responses. We propose a unifying model for how dynamic changes to oxidative metabolism influences regulation of macrophage inflammatory responses during microbial exposure.","Luan, Haoming; Horng, Tiffany",Curr Opin Immunol,169,22

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of delirium and coma, and risk factors for delirium in critically ill patients with COVID-19, to aid the development of strategies to mitigate delirium and associated sequelae. METHODS: This multicentre cohort study included 69 adult intensive care units (ICUs), across 14 countries. We included all patients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to participating ICUs with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection before April 28, 2020. Patients who were moribund or had life-support measures withdrawn within 24 h of ICU admission, prisoners, patients with pre-existing mental illness, neurodegenerative disorders, congenital or acquired brain damage, hepatic coma, drug overdose, suicide attempt, or those who were blind or deaf were excluded. We collected de-identified data from electronic health records on patient demographics, delirium and coma assessments, and management strategies for a 21-day period. Additional data on ventilator support, ICU length of stay, and vital status was collected for a 28-day period. The primary outcome was to determine the prevalence of delirium and coma and to investigate any associated risk factors associated with development of delirium the next day. We also investigated predictors of number of days alive without delirium or coma. These outcomes were investigated using multivariable regression. FINDINGS: Between Jan 20 and April 28, 2020, 4530 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to 69 ICUs, of whom 2088 patients were included in the study cohort. The median age of patients was 64 years (IQR 54 to 71) with a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II of 40·0 (30·0 to 53·0). 1397 (66·9%) of 2088 patients were invasively mechanically ventilated on the day of ICU admission and 1827 (87·5%) were invasively mechanical ventilated at some point during hospitalisation. Infusion with sedatives while on mechanical ventilation was common: 1337 (64·0%) of 2088 patients were given benzodiazepines for a median of 7·0 days (4·0 to 12·0) and 1481 (70·9%) were given propofol for a median of 7·0 days (4·0 to 11·0). Median Richmond Agitation–Sedation Scale score while on invasive mechanical ventilation was –4 (–5 to –3). 1704 (81·6%) of 2088 patients were comatose for a median of 10·0 days (6·0 to 15·0) and 1147 (54·9%) were delirious for a median of 3·0 days (2·0 to 6·0). Mechanical ventilation, use of restraints, and benzodiazepine, opioid, and vasopressor infusions, and antipsychotics were each associated with a higher risk of delirium the next day (all p≤0·04), whereas family visitation (in person or virtual) was associated with a lower risk of delirium (p<0·0001). During the 21-day study period, patients were alive without delirium or coma for a median of 5·0 days (0·0 to 14·0). At baseline, older age, higher SAPS II scores, male sex, smoking or alcohol abuse, use of vasopressors on day 1, and invasive mechanical ventilation on day 1 were independently associated with fewer days alive and free of delirium and coma (all p<0·01). 601 (28·8%) of 2088 patients died within 28 days of admission, with most of those deaths occurring in the ICU. INTERPRETATION: Acute brain dysfunction was highly prevalent and prolonged in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Benzodiazepine use and lack of family visitation were identified as modifiable risk factors for delirium, and thus these data present an opportunity to reduce acute brain dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.

Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) is considered the optimal sample for SARS-CoV2 diagnosis and sputum (SPT) has been proposed as an economic alternative. However, the temporal concordance of diagnosis in NPS and SPT has not been addressed. Methods: Through a longitudinal study we compared the shedding dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA evaluated by RT-qPCR in serially collected SPT and NPS obtained from 82 ambulatory and hospitalized patients during acute infection and convalescence. The concordance during the follow-up and cost analysis between both collected specimens was evaluated. Findings: We analyzed 379 samples, 177 NPS and 202 SPT. The highest proportion of positive samples was detected within the first 15 days after the symptoms onset. The median time of positivity was higher for NPS (median= 25 days) than SPT (median= 21 days). There was no significant difference in the median RT-qPCR CT values between both sample types. The temporal categorization of matched-paired samples indicated substantial correlation (r=0.6023) and substantial agreement (87.23%) during the first ten days since symptoms onset (kappa = 0.697). A cost analysis demonstrated a significant saving when the SPT specimen was used.

Recently, it was demonstrated that initiation of protein 3c is dependent on the upstream sequence. Monte Carlo simulations of RNA folding in this tricistronic mRNA3 indicate that a highly significant folding region occurs prior to the initiator AUG of 3c. The unusual folding region (UFR) of 265 nucleotides (nt) contains the coding sequences of proteins 3a and 3b. Details of the structural analyses show that five highly significant RNA stem-loops in the UFR can be modeled into a compact superstructure by the interaction of two predicted pseudoknot structures. The folded superstructure comprising nt 44 to 330, with additional 22 nt downstream from this UFR, is suggested to serve as a ribosome landing pad (or an internal ribosomal entry site) in the cap-independent translation of the 3c of IBV. Intriguingly, the proposed structural motif of this coronavirus shares structural features similar to those proposed in a number of picornavirus mRNAs. Based on the common structural features, a plausible base pairing model between mRNA3 and 18 S rRNA is suggested, which is consistent with a general mechanism for regulation of internal initiation described in many picornaviruses.","Le, Shu-Yun; Sonenberg, Nahum; Maizel, Jacob V.",Virology,169,17

During the so-called ‘first wave’, infection rates among this population group have ranged between 10% and 20%, raising as high as one in every four COVID-19 patients in Spain at the peak of the crisis. Now that many countries are already dealing with new waves of COVID-19 cases, a potential competition between HCW and non-HCW patients for scarce resources can still be a likely clinical scenario. In this paper, we address the question of whether HCW who become ill with COVID-19 should be prioritised in diagnostic, treatment or resource allocation protocols. We will evaluate some of the proposed arguments both in favour and against the prioritisation of HCW and also consider which clinical circumstances might warrant prioritising HCW and why could it be ethically appropriate to do so. We conclude that prioritising HCW’s access to protective equipment, diagnostic tests or even prophylactic or therapeutic drug regimes and vaccines might be ethically defensible. However, prioritising HCWs to receive intensive care unit (ICU) beds or ventilators is a much more nuanced decision, in which arguments such as instrumental value or reciprocity might not be enough, and economic and systemic values will need to be considered.","Real de Asua, Diego; Fins, Joseph J",J Med Ethics,169,24

Structural and biophysical studies have recently characterized the conformational landscapes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins in the prefusion form, revealing a spectrum of stable and more dynamic states. By employing molecular simulations and network modeling approaches, this study systematically examined functional dynamics and identified the regulatory centers of allosteric interactions for distinct functional states of the wild-type and mutant variants of the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion spike trimer. This study presents evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can function as an allosteric regulatory engine that fluctuates between dynamically distinct functional states. Perturbation-based modeling of the interaction networks revealed a key role of the cross-talk between the effector hotspots in the receptor binding domain and the fusion peptide proximal region of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The results have shown that the allosteric hotspots of the interaction networks in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can control the dynamic switching between functional conformational states that are associated with virus entry to the host receptor. This study offers a useful and novel perspective on the underlying mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein through the lens of allosteric signaling as a regulatory apparatus of virus transmission that could open up opportunities for targeted allosteric drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2 proteins and contribute to the rapid response to the current and potential future pandemic scenarios.","Verkhivker, Gennady M.",J Proteome Res,169,6

Actively calling patients to postpone appointments is a labour-intensive process. We were the first ophthalmic clinics in Hong Kong to use short message service (SMS) to dispatch messages simultaneously to a large number of patients to offer postponement of appointments. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether SMS is an effective method to reduce outpatient attendance during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is an observational study reviewing data on SMS messages sent to all patients attending ophthalmology clinics of a tertiary eye centre in Hong Kong. All SMS were sent at least 5 days before the scheduled appointments. The text message included an enquiry hotline for postponement of appointments and offered drug refill. The study included data from February to April 2020. Two hundred patients were invited to take part in a questionnaire on satisfaction level and reason(s) for appointment rescheduling. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 17,028 SMS were sent. The overall response rate was 23.6%. 14.3% postponed their appointments. This led to an overall 13.9% reduction of clinic attendance. The overall satisfaction was high (96%). The main reason for postponing appointment was worries about infection risk (93.1%). CONCLUSION: SMS was an efficient and cost-effective flow-control method which was well accepted by patients and can reduce outpatient attendance. The time saved can potentially allow healthcare workers to conduct other infection control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lai, Tracy H. T.; Lee, Monica; Au, Alvin K. H.; Tang, Heather H.

634410,634410,634410,May we overcome the current serious limitations for distributing reconstituted mRNA vaccines?,12.55784,5.8347363,2021-03-12,"As a representative drug for the treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia and sepsis, Xuebijing (XBJ) injection is also one of the recommended drugs for the prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but its treatment mechanism for COVID-19 is still unclear. Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential mechanism of XBJ injection in the treatment of COVID-19 employing network pharmacology and molecular docking methods. The corresponding target genes of 45 main active ingredients in XBJ injection and COVID-19 were obtained by using multiple database retrieval and literature mining. 102 overlapping targets of them were screened as the core targets for analysis. Then built the PPI network, TCM-compound-target-disease, and disease-target-pathway networks with the help of Cytoscape 3.6.1 software. After that, utilized DAVID to perform gene ontology (GO) function enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis to predict the action mechanism of overlapping targets. Finally, by applying molecular docking technology, all compounds were docked with COVID-19 3 CL protease(3CLpro), spike protein (S protein), and angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). The results indicated that quercetin, luteolin, apigenin and other compounds in XBJ injection could affect TNF, MAPK1, IL6 and other overlapping targets. Meanwhile, anhydrosafflor yellow B (AHSYB), salvianolic acid B (SAB), and rutin could combine with COVID-19 crucial proteins, and then played the role of anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immune response to treat COVID-19. This study revealed the multiple active components, multiple targets, and multiple pathways of XBJ injection in the treatment of COVID-19, which provided a new perspective for the study of the mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the treatment of COVID-19.","XING, Yan; HUA, Ying-Rong; SHANG, Jing; GE, Wei-Hong; LIAO, Jun",Chinese Journal of Natural Medicines,169,1

The objective of this study was to establish the long-term effects of Covid-19 following hospitalisation and the impact these may have on patient reported outcome measures. Design: A multicentre, prospective cohort study with at least 3 months follow-up of participants admitted to hospital between 5th February 2020 and 5th October 2020. Setting: 31 hospitals in the United Kingdom. Participants: 327 hospitalised participants discharged alive from hospital with confirmed/high likelihood SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main outcome measures and comparisons: The primary outcome was self-reported recovery at least ninety days after initial Covid-19 symptom onset. Secondary outcomes included new symptoms, new or increased disability (Washington group short scale), breathlessness (MRC Dyspnoea scale) and quality of life (EQ5D-5L). We compared these outcome measures across age, comorbidity status and in-hospital Covid-19 severity to identify groups at highest risk of developing long-term difficulties. Multilevel logistic and linear regression models were built to adjust for the effects of patient and centre level risk factors on these outcomes. Results: In total 53.7% (443/824) contacted participants responded, yielding 73.8% (327/443) responses with follow-up of 90 days or more from symptom onset. The median time between symptom onset of initial illness and completing the participant questionnaire was 222 days (Interquartile range (IQR) 189 to 269 days). In total, 54.7% (179/327) of participants reported they did not feel fully recovered. Persistent symptoms were reported by 93.3% (305/325) of participants, with fatigue the most common (82.8%, 255/308), followed by breathlessness (53.5%, 175/327). 46.8% (153/327) reported an increase in MRC dyspnoea scale of at least one grade. New or worse disability was reported by 24.2% (79/327) of participants. Overall (EQ5D-5L) summary index was significantly worse at the time of follow-up (median difference 0.1 points on a scale of 0 to 1, IQR: -0.2 to 0.0). Females under the age of 50 years were five times less likely to report feeling recovered (adjusted OR 5.09, 95% CI 1.64 to 15.74), were more likely to have greater disability (adjusted OR 4.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 15.94), twice as likely to report worse fatigue (adjusted OR 2.06, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.31) and seven times more likely to become more breathless (adjusted OR 7.15, 95% CI 2.24 to 22.83) than men of the same age. Conclusions: Survivors of Covid-19 experienced long-term symptoms, new disability, increased breathlessness, and reduced quality of life. These findings were present even in young, previously healthy working age adults, and were most common in younger females. Policymakers should fund further research to identify effective treatments for long-Covid and ensure healthcare, social care and welfare support is available for individuals with long-Covid.","Sigfrid, L.; Drake, T.

To improve the knowledge of the heritage of plant genetic resources in this Middle Income Country, this study had three main goals: (i) to provide a checklist of food legumes; (ii) to investigate which species are traded in local markets and, based on field surveys, to compare species for their chemical, phenolic, antioxidant, and nutritional composition; and (iii) to discuss the agronomic value and contribution to food security in this archipelago. Our results revealed that 15 species are used as food and 5 of them are locally traded (Cajanus cajan, Lablab purpureus, Phaseolus lunatus, Phaseolus vulgaris, and Vigna unguiculata). The role of these species as sources of important minerals, antioxidants, and nutritional components for food security is highlighted, and the native ones (Lablab purpureus and Vigna unguiculata) stand-out as particularly well-adapted to the climate of these islands, which are already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change. We conclude that the sustainable use of these genetic resources can contribute to the reduction of hunger and poverty, thus meeting some challenges of the Sustainable Development Goals.","Brilhante, Miguel; Varela, Eromise; P.

The purified lectin has a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa in reducing as well as in non-reducing SDS-PAGE. In hydrodynamic studies by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) showed that purified lectin was monomeric in nature with a molecular size of 2.38 ± 0.03 nm. Agglutination activity of purified lectin was confirmed by rabbit erythrocytes and its agglutination activity was inhibited by d-mannose and a glycoprotein (ovalbumin). Glycoprotein nature of purified lectin was confirmed by Periodic Acid Schiff’s (PAS) stain. Purified lectin showed moderate pH and thermal stability by retaining hemagglutination activity from pH 6–8 and temperature up to 60 °C. It also suppressed the growth of human colon cancer cells (Caco-2) and cervical cancer cells (HeLa) with IC(50) values of 127 μg/mL and 158 μg/mL respectively, after 24-h treatment. Morphological studies of treated cells (Caco-2 and HeLa) with hyacinth lectin by AO/EB dual staining indicated that purified lectin is capable of inducing apoptosis.","Naik, Sanjay; Rawat, Ravindra Singh; Khandai, Santripti; Kumar, Mukesh; Jena, Sidhartha S.; Vijayalakshmi, Mookambeswaran A.; Kumar, Sanjit",Int J Biol Macromol,169,1

However, what happened just before the Italian index case has not yet been investigated. To answer this question, we evaluated the potential impact of COVID-19 on the clinical features of a cohort of neurological inpatients admitted right before the Italian index case, as compared to the same period of the previous year. Demographic, clinical, treatment and laboratory data were extracted from medical records. The data collected included all inpatients who had been admitted to the Neurology and Stroke Units of the Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy, from December 15, 2018 to February 20, 2019 and from December 15, 2019 to February 20, 2020. Of the 248 patients, 97 subjects (39.1%) were admitted for an acute cerebrovascular event: 46 in the 2018/2019 period (mean [SD] age, 72.3 [15.6] years; 22 men [47.8%]), and 51 in the 2019/2020 interval (mean [SD] age, 72.8 [12.4] years; 24 men [47.1%]). The number of cryptogenic strokes has increased during the 2019–2020 year, as compared to the previous year (30 [58.8%] vs. 18 [39.1%], p = 0.05). These patients had a longer hospitalization (mean [SD] day, 15.7 [10.5] days vs. mean [SD] day, 11.7 [7.2] days, p = 0.03) and more frequent cerebrovascular complications (9 [30.0%] vs. 2 [11.1%]), but presented a lower incidence of cardiocerebral risk factors (18 [60.0%] vs. 14 [77.8%]). Right before the Italian index case, an increase in cryptogenic strokes has occurred, possibly due to the concomitant COVID-19.","Pietroboni, Anna M.; Lanfranconi, Silvia; Novella, Alessio; Carandini, Tiziana; Arighi, Andrea; Abati, Elena; Brusa, Roberta; Costamagna, Gianluca; Lazzeri, Giulia; Mauri, Eleonora; Pozzato, Mattia; Sacchi, Luca; Valcamonica, Gloria; Villa, Davide; Bonato, Sara; Comi, Giacomo P.; Bresolin, Nereo; Galimberti, Daniela; Scarpini, Elio; Nobili, Alessandro",Intern Emerg Med,169,22

This paper mainly focuses on the transfer learning process to detect breast cancer. Modified VGG (MVGG) is proposed and implemented on datasets of 2D and 3D images of mammograms. Experimental results showed that the proposed hybrid transfer learning model (a fusion of MVGG and ImageNet) provides an accuracy of 94.3%. On the other hand, only the proposed MVGG architecture provides an accuracy of 89.8%. So, it is precisely stated that the proposed hybrid pre-trained network outperforms other compared Convolutional Neural Networks. The proposed architecture can be considered as an effective tool for radiologists to decrease the false negative and false positive rates. Therefore, the efficiency of mammography analysis will be improved.","Khamparia, Aditya; Bharati, Subrato; Podder, Prajoy; Gupta, Deepak; Khanna, Ashish; Phung, Thai Kim; Thanh, Dang N.

Although novel determination protocols have been developed and legislation has been implemented within Europe, the side effects of mycotoxins on the homeostatic mechanisms of the animals have not been extensively considered. Feed mycotoxin contamination and the effects on the antioxidant status of livestock (poultry, swine, and ruminants) are presented. The findings support the idea that the antioxidant systems in both monogastrics and ruminants are challenged under the detrimental effect of mycotoxins by increasing the toxic lipid peroxidation by-product malondialdehyde (MDA) and inhibiting the activity of antioxidant defense mechanisms. The degree of oxidative stress is related to the duration of contamination, co-contamination, the synergetic effects, toxin levels, animal age, species, and productive stage. Since the damaging effects of MDA and other by-products derived by lipid peroxidation as well as reactive oxygen species have been extensively studied on human health, a more integrated monitoring mechanism (which will take into account the oxidative stability) is urgently required to be implemented in animal products.","Mavrommatis, Alexandros; Giamouri, Elisavet; Tavrizelou, Savvina; Zacharioudaki, Maria; Danezis, George; Simitzis, Panagiotis E.; Zoidis, Evangelos; Tsiplakou, Eleni; Pappas, Athanasios C.; Georgiou, Constantinos A.; Feggeros, Kostas",Antioxidants (Basel),169,20

He did not develop an immune response after the first episode of COVID-19; however, immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected after the second episode. CONCLUSIONS: Through this case, we discuss the concept of reactivation and reinfection in the post-COVID period. We suggest that standard guidelines should be established to check for viral shedding and immune response among cured cases of COVID-19 after discharge via serial real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and IgG antibody detection. Further, strict hygiene practices should be stressed to these patients with possibility of COVID-19 recurrence.","Garg, Jaya; Agarwal, Jyotsna; Das, Anupam; Sen, Manodeep",J Med Case Rep,169,29

Methods: The T21RS COVID-19 Initiative launched an international survey for clinicians or caregivers/family members on patients with COVID-19 and DS (N=1046). De-identified survey data collected between April and October 2020 were analysed and compared with the UK ISARIC4C survey of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without DS. COVID-19 patients with DS from the ISARIC4C survey (ISARIC4C DS cases=100) were matched to a random set of patients without DS (ISARIC4C controls=400) and hospitalized DS cases in the T21RS survey (T21RS DS cases=100) based on age, gender, and ethnicity. Findings: The mean age in the T21RS survey was 29 years (SD=18), 73% lived with their family. Similar to the general population, the most frequent signs and symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Pain and nausea were reported less frequently (p<0.01), whereas altered consciousness/confusion were reported more frequently (p<0.01). Risk factors for hospitalization and mortality were similar to the general population (age, male gender, diabetes, obesity, dementia) with the addition of congenital heart defects as a risk factor for hospitalization. Mortality rates showed a rapid increase from age 40 and were higher than for controls (T21RS DS versus controls: risk ratio (RR)=3.5 (95%-CI=2.6;4.4), ISARIC4C DS versus controls: RR=2.9 (95%-CI=2.1;3.8)) even after adjusting for known risk factors for COVID-19 mortality. Interpretation: Leading signs/symptoms of COVID-19 and risk factors for severe disease course are similar to the general population. However, individuals with DS present significantly higher rates of mortality, especially from age 40.

We report the effect of temperature on R(t) is likely to be negative but not of statistical significance, which holds for most of included regions except for those in North China. CONCLUSIONS: We found little statistical evidence for that the higher temperature may reduce the transmissibility of COVID-19. Since intensive control measures against the COVID-19 epidemics were implemented in China, we acknowledge this may impact the underlying effect size estimation, and thus cautiousness should be taken when interpreting our findings.","Wang, Qingan; Zhao, Yu; Zhang, Yajuan; Qiu, Jiangwei; Li, Juan; Yan, Ni; Li, Nan; Zhang, Jiaxing; Tian, Di; Sha, Xiaolan; Jing, Jinyun; Yang, Chan; Wang, Kairong; Xu, Rongbin; Zhang, Yuhong; Yang, Huifang; Zhao, Shi; Zhao, Yi",Environ Res,169,16

Enlargement of the injection site&rsquo;s draining lymph nodes is increasingly reported, but is not yet widely recognised as being possibly associated with recent vaccination. As patients at risk of a severe course of COVID-19, indicated by their medical history such as a previous diagnosis of malignancy, receive priority vaccination, newly palpable lymph nodes raise concerns of disease progression. In this case series, we report on five patients who presented with enlarged lymph nodes after COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: Sonography guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed in five patients presenting with PET-positive and/or enlarged lymph nodes after COVID-19 vaccination with either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. RESULTS: COVID-19 vaccination had been carried out in all cases, with an interval of between 3 and 33 days prior to FNA. Three of five patients had a history of neoplasms. The vaccine was administered into the deltoid muscle, with subsequent enlargement of either the cervical, supra-, infra- or retroclavicular, or axillary lymph nodes, in four out of five cases ipsilaterally. In all cases, cytology and additional analyses showed a reactive lymphadenopathy without any sign of malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of newly enlarged lymph nodes after recent COVID-19 vaccination should be considered reactive in the first instance, occurring owing to stimulation of the immune system. A clinical follow-up according to the patient&rsquo;s risk profile without further diagnostic measures is justified. In the case of preexisting unilateral cancer, vaccination should be given contralaterally whenever possible. Persistently enlarged lymph nodes should be re-evaluated (2 to) 6 weeks after the second dose, with additional diagnostic tests tailored to the clinical context. Fine needle aspiration is a well established, safe, rapid and cost-effective method to investigate an underlying malignancy, especially metastasis. Recording vaccination history, including date of injection, site and vaccine type, as well as communicating this information to treating physicians of different specialties is paramount for properly handling COVID-19 vaccine-associated lymphadenopathy.","Hagen, Cristina; Nowack, Miriam; Messerli, Michael; Saro, Francesca; Mangold, Felix; Bode, Peter Karl",Swiss Med Wkly,169,28

We sought to determine the prevalence and predictors of medication-related emergency department admissions, among patients with cardiovascular diseases at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, Uganda. METHODS: Institutional research ethics approval was secured to conduct a cross-sectional study at the Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital emergency department, between February and September, 2020. All eligible and consenting patients were enrolled in a consecutive manner after a preliminary diagnosis was made by the attending physician. Structured questionnaire interview and comprehensive medication history reviews were used to identify medication therapy problems, in collaboration with a resident physician present on duty. We used sequential categorization for medication therapy problem(s). Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were used to determine prevalence and predictors of medication-related emergency department admissions. RESULTS: Out of the 128 patients interviewed, 105 (82%) patient admissions were associated with a medication therapy problem: ineffectiveness of drug therapy (53.3%, 56), medication non-adherence (42.9%, 45), and adverse drug reactions (3.8%, 4). Out of a total of 90 incidences of medication non-adherence, 34.4% (31/90) were due to lack of understanding of patient medication regimen, and 27.8% (25/90) due to unaffordable cost of medicines. Female gender (AOR = 4.31 [1.43, 13.03 at 95% CI]; P-value = 0.010]) and a history of tobacco use (AOR = 9.58 [1.14, 80.28 at 95% CI]; P-value = 0.037) were statistically significant predictors of medication-related emergency department admissions in adjusted analysis. CONCLUSION: Four in five emergency department admissions were associated with medication-related causes, majorly due to ineffectiveness of drug therapy. Knowledge gap on patient medication regimens was the most prevalent cause for medication non-adherence. Female gender and previous or current tobacco use was an independent risk factor for medication-related admissions.","Kiptoo, Joshua; Yadesa, Tadele Mekuriya; Muzoora, Conrad; Namugambe, Juliet Sanyu; Tamukong, Robert",Open Access Emerg Med,169,16

METHODS: We systematically reviewed the published studies to assess the association of RAS inhibitors with mortality as well as disease severity in COVID-19 patients. A systematic literature search was performed to retrieve relevant original studies investigating mortality and severity (severe/critical disease) in COVID-19 patients with and without exposure to RAS inhibitors. RESULTS: A total of 59 original studies were included for qualitative synthesis. Twenty-four studies that reported adjusted effect sizes (24 studies reported mortality outcomes and 16 studies reported disease severity outcomes), conducted in RAS inhibitor–exposed and unexposed groups, were pooled in random-effects models to estimate overall risk. Quality assessment of studies revealed that most of the studies included were of fair quality. The use of an ACEI/ARB in COVID-19 patients was significantly associated with lower odds (odds ratio [OR] = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56–0.95; n = 18,749) or hazard (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.75, 95% CI 0.60–0.95; n = 26,598) of mortality compared with non-use of ACEI/ARB. However, the use of an ACEI/ARB was non-significantly associated with lower odds (OR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.75–1.10; n = 7446) or hazard (HR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.33–1.66; n = 6325) of developing severe/critical disease compared with non-use of an ACEI/ARB. DISCUSSION: Since there was no increased risk of harm, the use of RAS inhibitors for hypertension and other established clinical indications can be maintained in COVID-19 patients.

This paper zooms in on business shutdowns and investigates their effectiveness in reducing mortality. We leverage upon highly granular death registry data for over 4,000 Italian municipalities in a diff-in-diff approach that allows us to credibly mitigate endogeneity concerns. Our results, which are robust to controlling for a host of co-factors, offer strong evidence that business shutdowns are very effective in reducing mortality. We calculate that the death toll from the first wave of COVID-19 in Italy would have been twice as high in their absence. Our findings also highlight that timeliness is key: by acting one week earlier, the government could have reduced the death toll by an additional 25%. Finally, our estimates suggest that shutdowns should be targeted: closing shops, bars and restaurants saves the most lives, while shutting down manufacturing and construction activities has only mild effects.","Ciminelli, G.; Garcia-Mandico, S.",,169,16

A narrative review was conducted, overviewing items of the Infectious Disease Committee and the Tuberculosis Committee of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare between 2010 and 2019. The mean value of items discussed in each meeting were 9.7 items. Among these items, these committees have discussed about countermeasures in terms of reduced burden of indigenous infectious diseases such as measles, rubella and pertussis, and increased risk of imported infectious diseases such as Ebola virus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, plague, avian influenza, pandemic influenza and tuberculosis. These changes regarding infectious diseases lead to loss of target population, difficulty of early detection, and market failure in old and new antibiotics and others, which requires challenge to scattered at-risk targets, effort to training and awareness, and creation of novel public health policy for research and development as well as production and supply. Over the past decade, public health policy regarding global infectious diseases have been one of the key targets under the triangle of global infectious disease, and recent experience of Coronavirus disease 2019 will further prioritize it in Japan. However, the principles of public health policy are globally vulnerable in the Post-Corona era, which can lead to the collapse of democratic way. To combat global infectious diseases without going off the road, we need to learn about the past history of public health policy.","Noda, Hiroyuki",J Infect Chemother,169,22

This preliminary report investigates the prevalence and features of protracted symptoms in non-hospitalized university students who experienced mild-to-moderate acute illness. METHODS: 148 students completed an online study to earn research credit for class. Data from COVID-19 positive participants with symptoms ≥28 days (N=22) were compared to those who fully recovered (N=21) and those not diagnosed with COVID-19 (N=58). RESULTS: 51% of participants who contracted COVID-19 (N=43) experienced symptoms ≥28 days and were classified as having post-COVID syndrome; all but one (96%) were female. During acute illness the post-COVID group, compared to those who fully recovered, experienced significantly more chest pain (64% vs 14%; P=.002), fatigue (86% vs 48%; P=.009), fever (82% vs 48%; P=.02), olfactory impairment (82% vs 52%; P=.04), headaches (32% vs 5%; P<.05), and diarrhea (32% vs 5%; P<.05). Compared to those not diagnosed with COVID-19, the post-COVID syndrome group more frequently experienced exercise intolerance (43% vs. 0%; P<.001), dyspnea (43% vs. 0%; P<.001), chest pain (31% vs 7%; P=.002), olfactory impairment (19% vs 0%; P=.004), lymphadenopathy (19% vs 0%; P=.004), gustatory impairment (14% vs 0%; P=.02), and appetite loss (36% vs 14%; P=.02). INTERPRETATION: Our results contradict the perception that this “yet to be defined” post-COVID syndrome predominantly affects middle-aged adults and suggest that exercise intolerance, dyspnea, chest pain, chemosensory impairment, lymphadenopathy, rhinitis, and appetite loss may differentiate post-COVID syndrome from general symptoms of pandemic, age, and academic related stress. These findings are also consistent with previous reports that females are more vulnerable to this post viral syndrome. Large-scale population-based studies are essential to discerning the magnitude and characterization of post-COVID syndrome in young adults as well as more diverse populations.","Walsh-Messinger, Julie; Manis, Hannah; Vrabec, Alison; Sizemore, Jenna; Bishof, Karyn; Debidda, Marcella; Malaspina, Dolores; Greenspan, Noah",medRxiv,169,21

This study investigated the change in QOL, measured by the CFQ-R, in adult pwcf prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The CFQ-R scores of 88 adult pwcf completed at two routine clinic appointments (one prior to first COVID-19 case in Wales 28/2/20 and one post) were retrospectively reviewed. Any change in CFTR modulator therapy between these dates was recorded along with demographics, FEV1% and BMI. Results: 88 (52 male, 36 female) with mean age, FEV1% and BMI of 32.2 years, 61.6% and 22.7 kg/m2 respectively had two consecutive CFQ-R results in the above time frame. Overall, mean social domain scores significantly declined (60.4 to 54.2 p < 0.001) and mean emotion scores fell from 69.3 to 65.9 (p = 0.07). Results did not vary between males and females. 59/88 had a change in modulator status during this period, mainly commencing Symkevi® or triple modulator therapy, and this group experienced a significant increase in FEV1% (p < 0.01) and BMI (p = 0.02) and a statistically significant improvement in every domain of the CFQ-R except emotion, eating, digestion and social. Their mean social score dropped significantly 59.5 to 54.2 (p = 0.018). Of the 29 pwcf with no change in modulator status, there was no significant change in FEV1% or BMI. Mean emotion domain scores, which assesses feelings of being sad, useless, lonely and difficulty making future plans, significantly worsened from 78.1 to 70.6 (p = 0.018). Mean social scores decreased from 62.1 to 54.2 (p = 0.037). Conclusion: This is the first study looking at QOL during COVID-19 in pwcf. During the COVID-19 pandemic there have been developments in access to highly effective modulators, but despite improvements in FEV1%, BMI and many CFQ-R domains suggesting improved health, emotion and social domain scores fell. This is likely to reflect the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Birkin, E.; Speight, L.; Smith, A.; Oleary, C.; Duckers, J.",Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,169,16

Background The Covid-19 pandemic is one of the most serious global public health threats in recent times. Understanding transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is of utmost importance to be able to respond to outbreaks and take action against the spread of the disease. Viral load is generally thought to correlate with transmission risk. Methods We used comprehensive administrative register data from Denmark, comprising the full population and all SARS-CoV-2 tests (August 25, 2020 to February 10, 2021), to estimate household transmission risk. Results We found that the transmission risk was negatively associated--approximately linear--with the Ct values of the tested primary cases. Also, we found that even for relatively high Ct values, the risk of transmission was not negligible; e.g., for primary cases with a Ct value of 38, we found a transmission risk of 8%. This implies that there is no obvious cut-off for Ct values for risk of transmission. We estimated the transmission risk according to age and found an almost linearly increasing transmission risk with the age of the primary cases for adults ([≥]20 years) and negatively for children (<20 years). Age had a higher impact than Ct value on the risk of transmission. Conclusions Lower Ct values (indicating higher viral load) are associated with higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, even at high Ct values, transmission occurs. In addition, we found a strong association between age and transmission risk, and this dominated the Ct value association.","Lyngse, F.

At any level, the role of health care providers has been rapidly revisited and eventually modified to face the pandemic. The search of the balance between the provision of the most appropriate health-related services and safety of both patients and health care providers has become an indisputable necessity. The consequently increased work load, along with a widespread feeling of intellectual isolation, emotional overload, sense of inadequacy for involvement in tasks and disciplines which are not always familiar have all been proposed as factors related to the onset and/or worsening of the burnout phenomenon. This latter is sadly renown among care givers and is particularly common among medical oncologists. We herein share our perspectives on the burnout phenomenon over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, with a specific focus on medical oncologists. Results from the most recent and inherent studies are presented and commented in light of hints provided by the experience matured by a quite restricted, still potentially representative, number of professionals figures from the medical oncologists' category. Reasons are proposed to explain the sense of inadequacy currently perceived in relation to the limits imposed by the current pandemic.

One measure included closing all non-food shops, including vape shops. METHODS: A retrospective online questionnaire was used to investigate the impact of closing the vape shops on the vaping and/or smoking behavior of current vapers. RESULTS: The sample (n = 202) reached consisted of 70% exclusive vapers, 29% dual users and 1% no-product users. Over half (55%, 112/202) of participants needed to buy e-liquid during the lockdown, with a small majority being able to buy e-liquids – mostly with their usual nicotine concentrations, flavor or brand –, but as much as 39% (44/112) of them ran out of e-liquid. Those buying e-liquid mainly did so by making purchases via foreign online webshops. A similar pattern was observed with respect to purchasing hardware, with about half (47%, 95/202) of participants reporting hardware availability and with a small majority (53%, 107/202) reporting hardware unavailability. Of those indicating that hardware was not available, 38% (41/107) ran out of a properly functioning e-cigarette. A non-trivial minority had to consume e-liquids with another nicotine concentration, flavor or brand than usual. One seventh of exclusive vapers before lockdown relapsed partly or completely to smoking during the lockdown. The main reasons for changing vaping and/or smoking behavior included the unavailability of e-liquid with nicotine, the unavailability of hardware, and stress/worries about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of vapers succeeded in maintaining their vaping behavior as usual, highly likely due to (illegally) buying consumables online. Nevertheless, for a minority the lockdown period resulted in unintended consequences and these vapers relapsed (completely) to smoking. Even during periods of lockdown, smokers and vapers should be able to purchase low(er)-risk alternatives to smoking, for example e-cigarettes.

The effect of anti-COVID-19 agent remdesivir on kidneys is currently unknown. We aimed to determine the effect of remdesivir on renal fibrosis and its downstream mechanisms. Methods: Remdesivir and its active nucleoside metabolite GS-441524 were used to treat TGF-β stimulated renal fibroblasts (NRK-49F) and human renal epithelial (HK2) cells. Vehicle or remdesivir were given by intraperitoneal injection or renal injection through the left ureter in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice. Serum and kidneys were harvested. The concentrations of remdesivir and GS-441524 were measured using LC-MS/MS. Renal and liver function were assessed. Renal fibrosis was evaluated by Masson’s trichrome staining and Western blotting. Results: Remdesivir and GS-441524 inhibited the expression of fibrotic markers (fibronectin and aSMA) in NRK-49F and HK2 cells. Intraperitoneal injection or renal injection of remdesivir attenuated renal fibrosis in UUO kidneys. Renal and liver function were unchanged in remdesivir treated UUO mice. Two remdesivir metabolites were detected after injection. Phosphorylation of Smad3 that was enhanced in cell and animal models for renal fibrosis was attenuated by remdesivir. In addition, the expression of Smad7, an anti-fibrotic factor, was increased after remdesivir treatment in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, knockdown of Smad7 blocked the antifibrotic effect of GS and RDV on renal cells.

The scope of the present cross-sectional study was to assess the prevalence of food insecurity among older adults and evaluate the association between food insecurity, malnutrition, chronic disease, multimorbidity and healthcare utilization. A total of 121 older adults (mean (standard deviation) age: 72.6 (8.1)) were recruited from a Primary Care Health Center from 10 August 2019 to 10 September 2019. Food insecurity and malnutrition status were assessed by the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale and Mini Nutritional Assessment tool, respectively. Recorded variables included financial, family data and comorbidities. The prevalence of food insecurity in the sample reached 50.4%, with men and older adults malnourished or at risk for malnutrition, exhibiting high risk for food insecurity. Multimorbidity, frequency of health care utilization and medication adherence were not associated with food insecurity, possibly due to the free health services and remunerated medications offered by the Greek government. However, male gender and malnutrition risk were significant predictors of food insecurity in the multiple logistic analyses. This study highlights the need for mainstreaming food insecurity assessment among older adults with comorbidities, especially those at risk for malnutrition.","Gkiouras, Konstantinos; Cheristanidis, Stavros; Papailia, Theopoula D.; Grammatikopoulou, Maria G.; Karamitsios, Nikolaos; Goulis, Dimitrios G.; Papamitsou, Theodora",Nutrients,169,8

Cyclic sulfonamide derivative was identified as a successful compound and showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. In this study, the structure and activity relationships of 35 cyclic sulfonamide compound inhibitors were investigated by using three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) and holographic quantitative structure-activity relationship (HQSAR).Two models with good statistical parameters and reliable predictive ability were obtained from the same training set, including Topomer CoMFA ( q 2 = 0.623, r 2 = 0.938, r p r e d 2 = 0.893) model and HQSAR ( q 2 = 0.704, r 2 = 0.958, r p r e d 2 = 0.779 ) model, the established models not only have good stability, but also show good external prediction ability for the test set. The contour and color code maps of the models provide a lot of useful information for determining the structural requirements affecting the activity; this information paved the way for the design of four novel cyclic sulfonamide compounds, and predicted their pIC50 values. We explore the interaction between the newly designed molecule and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro by molecular docking. The docking results showed that GLU166, GLN192, ALA194, and VAL186 may be the potential active residues of the SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor evaluated in this study. Finally, the oral bioavailability and toxicity of the newly designed cyclic sulfonamide compounds were evaluated and the results showed that the four newly designed cyclic sulfonamide compounds have major ADMET properties and can be used as reliable inhibitors against COVID-19. These results may provide useful insights for the design of effective SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.","Tong, Jianbo; Zhang, Xing; Luo, Ding; Bian, Shuai",Chinese Journal of Analytical Chemistry,169,19

In addition to the physical health, economic, and social implications, the psychological impacts of this pandemic are increasingly being reported in the scientific literature. This narrative review reflected on scholarly articles on the epidemiology of mental health problems in COVID-19. The current literature suggests that people affected by COVID-19 may have a high burden of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety disorders, stress, panic attack, irrational anger, impulsivity, somatization disorder, sleep disorders, emotional disturbance, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and suicidal behavior. Moreover, several factors associated with mental health problems in COVID-19 are found, which include age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, income, place of living, close contact with people with COVID-19, comorbid physical and mental health problems, exposure to COVID-19 related news and social media, coping styles, stigma, psychosocial support, health communication, confidence in health services, personal protective measures, risk of contracting COVID-19, and perceived likelihood of survival. Furthermore, the epidemiological distribution of mental health problems and associated factors were heterogeneous among the general public, COVID-19 patients, and healthcare providers. The current evidence suggests that a psychiatric epidemic is cooccurring with the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitates the attention of the global health community. Future epidemiological studies should emphasize on psychopathological variations and temporality of mental health problems in different populations. Nonetheless, multipronged interventions should be developed and adopted to address the existing psychosocial challenges and promote mental health amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hossain, Md Mahbub; Tasnim, Samia; Sultana, Abida; Faizah, Farah; Mazumder, Hoimonty; Zou, Liye; McKyer, E.

Wuhan used to be the epicenter of China and finally controlled the outbreak through city lockdown and many other policies. However, the pandemic and the prevention strategies had a huge impact on the medical care procedures for breast cancer patients, leading to the delay or interruption of anticancer therapies. To better serve breast cancer patients under the premise of epidemic control, many strategies have been proposed and optimized in our center. One of the most important parts of these strategies is the promotion of telemedicine, including online consultation, online prescription, and drug mailing services. In keeping with the city and hospital policies, we have also introduced stricter ward management policies and more precise care. Here, we collected the diagnosis and treatment process of breast cancer patients in our center during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was found to be correlated to a reduction in chemotherapy-related myelosuppression and hepatic dysfunction, hoping to provide a reference for other cancer centers that may suffer from the similar situation.

This observational study reports current infection control behaviours in the home in UK and international users of the website, and examine how they might be improved to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Method: 28,285 users sought advice from four website pathways (to protect themselves generally, to protect others if the user was showing symptoms, to protect themselves if household members were showing symptoms, and to protect a household member who is at high risk) and completed outcome measures of current infection control behaviours within the home (self-isolation, social distancing, putting shopping/packages aside, wearing face-covering, cleaning and disinfecting, handwashing), and intentions to change these behaviours. Results: Current user behaviours mean scores varied across all infection control measures but were between 'sometimes' and 'quite often', except handwashing ('very often'). Behaviours were similar regardless of the website pathway used. After using Germ Defence, users recorded intentions to improve infection control behaviour across all website pathways and for all behaviours. Conclusions: Self-reported infection control behaviours other than handwashing are lower than is optimal for infection prevention, although reported handwashing is much higher. The advice using behaviour change techniques in Germ Defence led to intentions to improve these behaviours. This has been shown previously to reduce the incidence, severity and transmission of infections. These findings suggest that promoting Germ Defence within national and local public health guidance could reduce COVID-19 transmission.","Ainsworth, B.; Miller, S.; Denison-Day, J.; Stuart, B.; Groot, J.; Rice, C.; Bostock, J.; Hu, X.-Y.; Morton, K.; Towler, L.; Moore, M.; Willcox, M.

The current disease-induced immunity level î in a region approximately equals the cumulative fraction infected, which primarily depends on two factors: (i) the initial potential for COVID-19 in the region (R(0)), and (ii) the preventive measures put in place. Using a mathematical model including heterogeneities owing to age, social activity and susceptibility, and allowing for time-varying preventive measures, the risk for a new epidemic wave and its doubling time are investigated. Focus lies on quantifying the minimal overall effect of preventive measures p(Min) needed to prevent a future outbreak. It is shown that î plays a more influential roll than when immunity is obtained from vaccination. Secondly, by comparing regions with different R(0) and î it is shown that regions with lower R(0) and low î may need higher preventive measures (p(Min)) compared with regions having higher R(0) but also higher î, even when such immunity levels are far from herd immunity. Our results are illustrated on different regions but these comparisons contain lots of uncertainty due to simplistic model assumptions and insufficient data fitting, and should accordingly be interpreted with caution.","Britton, Tom; Trapman, Pieter; Ball, Frank",Royal Society open science,169,24

In this context, emerging shreds of evidence in lung biology indicated the meticulous role of lung epithelia in provoking a plethora of lung diseases in contrast to earlier beliefs. As lung epithelia are ceaselessly exposed to the environment, they need to have multiple protective mechanisms to maintain the integrity of lung structure and function. As ciliated airway epithelium and type 2 alveolar epithelia require intense energy for executing their key functions like ciliary beating and surfactant production, it is no surprise that defects in mitochondrial function in these cells could perturb lung homeostasis and engage in the pathophysiology of lung diseases. On one hand, intracellular calcium plays a central role in executing key functions of lung epithelia, and on the other hand maintenance of intracellular calcium needs the buffering role of mitochondria. Thus, the regulation of mitochondrial calcium in lung epithelia seems to be critical in lung homeostasis and could be decisive in the pathogenesis of various lung diseases.","Ray, Archita; Jaiswal, Ashish; Dutta, Joytri; Singh, Sabita; Mabalirajan, Ulaganathan",Mitochondrion,169,20

We found that a mutation at amino acid position 90 in the H5N1 HA, outside the receptor-binding domain (RBD), could simultaneously induce changes in the RBD conformation to escape from nAb binding and alter the receptor preference through long-range regulation. This mutation was deemed a “key event” for interspecies transmission. It is likely a result of positive selection caused by antibodies, allowing the original invasion by new species-specific variants. A mutation at amino acid position 160 in the RBD only induced a change in receptor preference. This mutation was deemed a “maintaining adaptation”, which ensured that influenza virus variants would be able to infect new organisms of a different species successfully. The mutation is the result of adaptation caused by the receptor. Our results suggest that continuing occurrence of these two types of mutations made the variants persist in the new host species.

Understanding the potential sources of bias and methods to alleviate biases in these studies is important for informing their design and analysis. Confounding by individual-level risk factors in observational studies like these is relatively well appreciated. Here, we show how geographic structure and the underlying, natural dynamics of epidemics can also induce noncausal associations. We take the approach of simulating serologic studies in the context of an uncontrolled or a controlled epidemic, under different assumptions about whether prior infection does or does not protect an individual against subsequent infection, and using various designs and analytic approaches to analyze the simulated data. We find that in studies assessing whether seropositivity confers protection against future infection, comparing seropositive individuals to seronegative individuals with similar time-dependent patterns of exposure to infection, by stratifying or matching on geographic location and time of enrollment, is essential to prevent bias.","Kahn, Rebecca; Kennedy-Shaffer, Lee; Grad, Yonatan H; Robins, James M; Lipsitch, Marc",Am J Epidemiol,169,19

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study. Two reviewed consecutive RRD patients cohorts of the same length were treated during two different periods: the COVID-19 pandemic and the pre-COVID-19 group. The characteristics of patients, surgery, anesthesia methods, length of hospital stay, and the latest follow-up were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: There were 79 patients in the COVID-19 pandemic group with a 55.9% reduction (179). Compared to patients in the pre-COVID-19, patients in the COVID-19 pandemic had a longer presurgical waiting times (28days, 3days, p<0.001), a higher percentage of patients with presurgical poor (less than 0.02) visual acuity (55.7%, 32.4%, p = 0.009), and a higher percentage of patients with presurgical choroidal detachment (34.2%, 19.6%, p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in the severity of presurgical proliferative vitreoretinopathy between the two groups (p = 0.64). Surgeries on pathological myopia patients with macular hole retinal detachment were postponed in the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a lower percentage of scleral buckling (27.8%, 41.3%, p = 0.02) and a lower rate of subretinal fluid drainage (45.4%, 75.7%, p = 0.01) in the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study's objective is to evaluate 25 natural compounds from Citrus limon (CL) used by comprehensive molecular docking, density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics analysis against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Among all the experimental compounds, diosmetin has shown the best docking values against the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the standard antiviral drug. In DFT calculations, the order associated with biochemical reactivity is as follows: eriodictoyl > quercetin > spinacetin > diosmetin > luteolin > apigenin, whereas the regions of oxygen and hydrogen atoms from the selected isolated compounds are appropriate for electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks, respectively. Also, HOMO-LUMO and global descriptors values indicated a promising result of these compounds. Moreover, a molecular dynamics simulation study revealed the stable conformation and binding pattern in a stimulating environment of natural compounds CL.

Previous interventions with foods high in flavonoids have demonstrated beneficial acute and chronic mood effects in healthy child, adolescent and adult populations. It is unclear whether mood effects persist in populations who are potentially at-risk of developing mood disorders, such as postnatal mothers. This exploratory study investigated the effects of a 2-week daily dietary flavonoid intervention on mood (PANAS-NOW), anxiety (STAI), depressive symptoms (PHQ-8) and perceived quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF) in forty-one new mothers in the 0–12-month postnatal period, before and after flavonoid intervention. Mothers either added high flavonoid foods to their daily diet, or did not include additions following a randomised, between-groups, controlled design. Significant effects were observed in the flavonoid group with mothers reporting lower state anxiety and higher perceived quality of physical health at the 2-week timepoint. These findings suggest that regular dietary consumption of flavonoids may benefit mothers’ anxiety and perceived quality of life in the postnatal period.

Hand search for additional articles continued through September 24, 2020. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched on October 21, 2020. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: The inclusion criteria were publications that compared at least 20 cases of both pregnant patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on admission to labor and delivery and those who tested negative. Exclusion criteria were publications with fewer than 20 individuals in either category or those lacking data on primary outcomes. A systematic search of the selected databases was performed, with co-primary outcomes being rates of intrauterine fetal death and neonatal death. Secondary outcomes included rates of maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Of the 941 articles and completed trials identified, six studies met criteria. Our analysis included 728 deliveries to patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 3,836 contemporaneous deliveries to patients who tested negative. Intrauterine fetal death occurred in 8 of 728 (1.1%) patients who tested positive and 44 of 3,836 (1.1%) who tested negative (P=.60).

Mutual trust between the state and civil society, strong accountability of the government, and civic participation are essential components of cooperative disaster governance.","Choi, Hongjo; Kim, Seong-Yi; Kim, Jung-Woo; Park, Yukyung; Kim, Myoung-Hee",J Prev Med Public Health,169,24

Descriptive survey method was applied to investigate the intended variables. Data for this study was collected via an internet of 420 students (245 females and 175 males) from those whose email addresses were randomly accessed. Data was collect through questionnaires. Mean, standard deviation and t-test were used to analysis the collected data. The findings revealed that the psychological impacts of covid-19 on both male and female students were high. The results also showed that there was statistically significant difference between males and females in terms of every mean item. Therefore, it is recommended to engage actively in different activities, and relying on reliable sources of information, taking rests and the like are some of the mentioned coping strategies of the students. Finally, besides the transmitting of educational programs through TV, motivational speech, mass consultation/education through mass media like radio and television to reach those students who were dispersed to different parts of the country incorporates additional dimension of combating the psychological pressure of COVID-19.","Adefris, Dereje; Moges, Birhanu",Curr Psychol,169,3

Les principales voies de contamination sont l’inhalation de gouttelettes ou la transmission à la suite d’un contact avec des surfaces contaminées. Bien que la transmission par gouttelettes semble prédominer au niveau communautaire, l’exposition des personnels soignants dans les établissements de soins reste mal connue. Notre étude visait à évaluer les différents risques de transmission pour le personnel hospitalier prenant en charge des patients atteints d’une forme aiguë de COVID-19. Matériels et méthodes Cette étude observationnelle prospective a inclus des patients atteints par le SARS-CoV-2 et hospitalisés dans les 14 jours suivant l’apparition des symptômes. Plusieurs écouvillons ont été prélevés dans leur environnement : rebord de fenêtre, poignée de porte, ligne de perfusion, barrières de lit, dessus de table amovible, téléphone du patient, masque à oxygène ou canule nasale. Les masques portés par les agents de santé auprès des patients, soit pendant une procédure spécifique médicale ou paramédicale soit portés en continu à l’intérieur du service ont été collectés. Les masques ont été trempés dans un milieu de transport viral. La recherche de SARS-CoV-2 a été effectuée par RT-qPCR. Résultats Des écouvillons de surface ont été prélevés pour 43 patients (durée moyenne des symptômes : 8 jours). L’ARN du SARS-CoV-2 a été détecté sur toutes sortes de surfaces : barrières de lit (40%), masque à oxygène ou canule nasale (29 %), poignée de porte (28 %), dessus de table (24 %), bouton de réglage de perfusion ou pousse-seringue (10 %). Le téléphone du patient était positif dans 36 % des cas. Le rebord de la fenêtre, qui n’était pas inclus dans les procédures de bio-nettoyage, avait le taux de positivité le plus élevé : 41 %. Au total, 40 masques ont été portés par les personnels soignants après un seul geste de soin (utilisation moyenne de 8 minutes) et 40 masques portés en continu (utilisation moyenne de 211 minutes). Tous les 80 masques ont été testés négatifs pour l’ARN du SARS-COV-2, alors qu’un masque témoin porté par un patient infecté était positif. Conclusion Aucun masque de personnel soignant n’a été contaminé, même après des soins avec un risque élevé de transmission chez des patients hautement contaminants. Les surfaces les plus fréquemment touchées par les patients et les moins bio-nettoyées étaient les plus contaminées. Le principal risque de transmission à l’hôpital semble être le risque de contact. Bien que les masques semblent être correctement portés, les personnels soignants sous-estiment le risque de transmission contact, bien que majeur. Une attention particulière doit donc être portée au lavage des mains et au bio-nettoyage des surfaces.","Lomont, A.; Hassold, N.; Delagreverie, H.; Oubbea, S.; Nagle, S.; Alloui, C.; Zahar, J.; Cordel, H.",Infectious Diseases Now,169,7

A wide range of data is collected within healthcare settings; however, the extent to which this information is used to understand HCAI dynamics has not been quantified. AIM: To examine the use of spatiotemporal analyses to identify and prevent HCAI transmission in healthcare settings, and to provide recommendations for expanding the use of these techniques. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was undertaken, focusing on spatiotemporal examination of infectious diseases in healthcare settings. Abstracts and full-text articles were reviewed independently by two authors to determine inclusion. FINDINGS: In total, 146 studies met the inclusion criteria. There was considerable variation in the use of data, with surprisingly few studies (N = 22) using spatiotemporal-specific analyses to extend knowledge of HCAI transmission dynamics. The remaining 124 studies were descriptive. A modest increase in the application of statistical analyses has occurred in recent years. CONCLUSION: The incorporation of spatiotemporal analysis has been limited in healthcare settings, with only 15% of studies including any such analysis. Analytical studies provided greater data on transmission dynamics and effective control interventions than studies without spatiotemporal analyses. This indicates the need for greater integration of spatiotemporal techniques into HCAI investigations, as even simple analyses provide significant improvements in the understanding of prevention over simple descriptive summaries.","Davis, G.S.; Sevdalis, N.; Drumright, L.N.",J Hosp Infect,169,1

More recently, it was proposed that they could play a role in the antigen presentation to T lymphocytes but contradictory results have been published both concerning their surface expressed molecules and the T lymphocyte responses in mixed lymphocyte cultures. The use of either AECII cell line or fresh cells could explain the observed discrepancies. Thus, this study aimed at defining the most relevant model of accessory antigen presenting cells by carefully comparing the two models for their expression of surface molecules necessary for efficient antigen presentation. METHODS: We have compared by flow cytometry the surface expression of the major markers involved in the immunological synapse on the A549 cell line, the most popular model of type II alveolar epithelial cells, and freshly isolated cells. HLA-DR, CD80, CD86, ICOS-L, CD54, CD58 surface expression were studied in resting conditions as well as after IFN-γ/TNF-α treatment, two inflammatory cytokines, known to modulate some of these markers. RESULTS: The major difference found between the two cells types was the very low surface expression of HLA-DR on the A549 cell line compared to its constitutive expression on freshly isolated AECII. The surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules from the B7 family was very low for the CD86 (B7-2) and ICOS-L (B7-H2) and absent for CD80 (B7-1) on both freshly isolated cells and A549 cell line. Neither IFN-γ nor TNF-α could increase the expression of these classical co-stimulatory molecules. However CD54 (ICAM-1) and CD58 (LFA-3) adhesion molecules, known to be implicated in B7 independent co-stimulatory signals, were well expressed on the two cell types. CONCLUSIONS: Constitutive expression of MHC class I and II molecules as well as alternative co-stimulatory molecules by freshly isolated AECII render these cells a good model to study antigen presentation.","Corbière, Véronique; Dirix, Violette; Norrenberg, Sarah; Cappello, Mattéo; Remmelink, Myriam; Mascart, Françoise",Respir Res,169,1

Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Norway, UK, USA, and Australia during April/May 2020. Participants (n = 3810) were recruited via social media postings by the researchers and the involved universities. Differences between those with and without infection in the family were investigated with chi-square tests and independent t-tests. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess associations between sociodemographic variables and psychological outcomes (worry, loneliness, and mental health) in both groups. Results: Compared to their counterparts, participants with infection in the family reported higher levels of worries about themselves (p < 0.05) and their family members (p < 0.001) and had poorer mental health (p < 0.05). However, the effect sizes related to the differences were small. The largest effect (d = 0.24) concerned worries about their immediate family. Poorer psychological outcomes were observed in those who were younger, female, unemployed, living alone and had lower levels of education, yet with small effect sizes. Conclusions: In view of the small differences between those with and without infection, we generally conclude that the mental health effects of the COVID-19 situation are not limited to those who have been infected or have had an infection within the family but extend to the wider population.","Bonsaksen, Tore; Leung, Janni; Schoultz, Mariyana; Thygesen, Hilde; Price, Daicia; Ruffolo, Mary; Geirdal, Amy Østertun",Healthcare (Basel),169,13

ACE2R methylation across three CpG sites (cg04013915, cg08559914, cg03536816) determines the host cell’s entry. It regulates ACE2 expression by controlling the SIRT1 and KDM5B activity. Further, it regulates Type I and III IFN response by modulating H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 histone mark. SARS-CoV-2 protein with bromodomain and protein E mimics bromodomain histones and evades from host immune response. The 2′-O MTases mimics the host’s cap1 structure and plays a vital role in immune evasion through Hsp90-mediated epigenetic process to hijack the infected cells.

We developed data-driven susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-recovered (SEIQR) models to simulate the epidemic with the interventions of social distancing and epicenter lockdown. Population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters, and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size. As of Jan 01, 2020, the estimated initial number of latently infected individuals was 380.1 (95%-CI: 379.8~381.0). With 30 days of substantial social distancing, the reproductive number in Wuhan and Hubei was reduced from 2.2 (95%-CI: 1.4~3.9) to 1.58 (95%-CI: 1.34~2.07), and in other provinces from 2.56 (95%-CI: 2.43~2.63) to 1.65 (95%-CI: 1.56~1.76). We found that earlier intervention of social distancing could significantly limit the epidemic in mainland China. The number of infections could be reduced up to 98.9%, and the number of deaths could be reduced by up to 99.3% as of Feb 23, 2020. However, earlier epicenter lockdown would partially neutralize this favorable effect. Because it would cause in situ deteriorating, which overwhelms the improvement out of the epicenter. To minimize the epidemic size and death, stepwise implementation of social distancing in the epicenter city first, then in the province, and later the whole nation without the epicenter lockdown would be practical and cost-effective.","Zhang, Yuzhen; Jiang, Bin; Yuan, Jiamin; Tao, Yanyun",,169,16

The main organ affected in this infection is the lung and the virus uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the target cells. In this context, a controversy raised regarding the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAAS) blockers, as these drugs might increase ACE2 expression in some tissues and potentially increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is specially concerning in diabetic patients as diabetes is a risk factor for COVID-19. METHODS: 12-week old diabetic mice (db/db) were treated with ramipril, or vehicle control for 8 weeks. Non-diabetic db/m mice were included as controls. ACE2 expression and activity were studied in lung, kidney and heart of these animals. RESULTS: Kidney ACE2 activity was increased in the db/db mice as compared to the db/m (143.2% ± 23 vs 100% ± 22.3% %, p=0.004), whereas ramipril had no significant effect. In the lung, no differences were found in ACE2 when comparing db/db mice to db/m and Ramipril also had no significant effect. In the heart, diabetes decreased ACE2 activity (83% ± 16.8%, vs 100% ± 23.1% p=0.02), and ramipril increased ACE2 significantly (83% ± 16.8% vs 98.2% ± 15%, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: In a mouse model of type 2 diabetes, ramipril had no significant effect on ACE2 activity in either kidneys or in the lungs. Therefore, it is unlikely that RAAS blockers or at least angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection through increasing ACE2.","Vergara, Ander; Jacobs-Cachá, Conxita; Molina-Van den Bosch, Mireia; Domínguez-Báez, Pamela; Benito, Begoña; García-Carro, Clara; Serón, Daniel; Soler, María José",Mol Cell Endocrinol,169,1

General surgeons often excise these lesions as day-surgery. Balancing individual complexities of these cancers with trainee supervision and health expenditure is key to deliver efficacious care and maintain day-surgery volume for patients during a pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective, cross-sectional study was performed, examining 414 procedures from January 2019 to December 2020. Pathology was reviewed, and benign lesions excluded. Complete excision was based on 5 mm margins for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 0.5 mm microscopic margins for low-risk basal cell carcinoma (BCC) subtypes, and 3 mm for high-risk. Results of trainee-performed local anesthetic (LA) excision and general anesthetic (GA) excision (consultant scrubbed) were compared. RESULTS: 288 excisions were reviewed for completeness, location, and reconstruction modality. 69% were BCC (199), and 31% were SCC (89). These were excised under GA (72.5%) and LA (27.5%). 25.6% of BCC excisions were “close,” and 22.6% were “positive” under GA, whilst 31% were “close” and 15.5% were “positive” under LA. 52.8% of SCC excisions were “close,” and 7.8% were “positive” under GA, compared with 42.8% “close” and 9.5% “positive” under LA. Complex reconstruction (skin graft, flap) was more common under GA (38% SCC and 36.1% BCC), but occurred at a modest rate under LA (22% BCC and 28.5% SCC). CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm that comparable margins and reconstruction options are achievable when excising keratinocyte cancers under LA by surgical trainees. This is fundamental in cost and timesaving, as well as reducing risk of aerosolisation of virus during GA, in a pandemic.","McSweeney, William; Leaning, Matthew; Dastouri, Darius",J Skin Cancer,169,1

These include higher rates of comorbid illness and more limited health care access, higher rates of disadvantageous labor market positioning and community and housing conditions, greater exposure to long-term care residence, and higher incarceration rates. COVID-19 also exposes African Americans’ greater vulnerability to recession, and possibly greater susceptibility to accompanying behavioral health problems. If they are left unaddressed, the very vulnerabilities COVID-19 exploits may perpetuate themselves. However, continuing and supplementing health and economic COVID mitigation policies can disproportionately benefit African Americans and reduce short- and long-term adverse effects.

Thus, this study aimed to explore whether Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) are associated with increased risk of adverse birth complications and outcomes. A total of 76,799 deliveries between 2003 and 2013 in the Korean National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) were analyzed. Women with an AUD diagnosis preceding delivery were identified as individuals with alcohol dependence. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio of adverse birth complications and outcomes associated with alcohol dependence. Diagnosis of an AUD was associated with increased risk of adverse birth complications (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01–1.31, p = 0.0302). This was especially the case for women whose AUD diagnosis was in the same year as their delivery (HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.24–1.88, p < 0.0001). AUDs were associated with increased risk of adverse birth outcomes, especially when prevalent in the same year as a woman’s delivery.

Each of the 10 dsRNA genome segments of ObRV was sequenced and shown to contain a single open reading frame (ORF). Conserved motifs ([+ve] 5′-AAATAAA … (G)/(T)AGGTT-3′) were found at the termini of each segment, with the exception of Seg-6 and Seg-8, where the 5′ termini were 5′-AACAAA…-3′. The putative proteins encoded by each segment were compared with those of other members of the family Reoviridae. Phylogenetic comparisons to published sequences for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes from other reoviruses indicated that ObRV is most closely related to members of the genus Cypovirus. However, unlike the cypoviruses, ObRV has a double-layered capsid structure. When the protein encoded by ObRV Seg-10 was expressed (by inserting the open reading frame into a baculovirus expression vector) no ‘occlusion bodies’ were observed in the recombinant baculovirus infected insect cell cultures. This suggests that unlike the cypoviruses, Seg-10 of ObRV does not contain a polyhedrin gene. Further phylogenetic comparisons also identified relationships between Seg-2 and Seg-10 of ObRV, and genes of Diadromus pulchellus Idnoreovirus 1 (DpIRV1), suggesting that ObRV represents a new species from the genus Idnoreovirus.","Graham, Robert I.; Rao, Shujing; Sait, Steven M.; Attoui, Houssam; Mertens, Peter P.C.; Hails, Rosemary S.; Possee, Robert D.",Virus Res,169,10

And investigate the relationship between serum 25(OH)D and clinical outcomes of patients. Result 205 patients with a mean age of 59.71 years were enrolled. Our findings did not reveal a significant difference in mean levels of vitamin between improved (34.09) and deceased patients (34.54). However, in patients with severe disease, there was a considerable difference in levels of vitamin D in improved and deceased patients (P.value: 0.021). According to our results, the mortality rate was slightly higher in men (odds ratio:2.2). Furthermore, the mean age (64.20 vs. 58.51) and the presence of at least two comorbidities (odds ratio: 2.40) were significantly higher in deceased patients. Conclusion In this study, we did not reveal a statistical difference in mean levels of vitamin D and the outcome of patients with COVID-19. We concluded that in patients with severe disease, vitamin D deficiency could affect the course of the disease and mortality, especially in comorbidity and older people.","Tehrani, Shabnam; Khabiri, Neda; Moradi, Hamideh; mosavat, mina sadat; khabiri, seyyed saeed",Clin Nutr ESPEN,169,1

There are particular considerations for involving children and young people in research in potentially sensitive and emotional subject areas such as palliative care. AIM: To evaluate the experiences of young people of Patient and Public Involvement for a paediatric palliative care research study. DESIGN: Anonymous written feedback was collected from group members about their experiences of Patient and Public Involvement in a paediatric palliative care research study. An inductive thematic analysis of the feedback was conducted using NVivo. SETTING / PARTICIPANTS: Young people aged 12–22 years who were members of existing advisory groups at a children’s hospital, hospice and the clinical research network in the West Midlands, UK. RESULTS: Feedback was provided by 30 young people at three meetings, held between December 2016 and February 2017. Three themes emerged: (1) Involvement: Young people have a desire to be involved in palliative care research, and recognise the importance of the subject area. (2) Impact: Researchers should demonstrate the impact of the involvement work on the research, by regularly providing feedback. (3) Learning: Opportunities to learn both about the topic and about research more widely were valued. CONCLUSIONS: Young people want to be involved in palliative care research, and recognise its importance. A continuous relationship with the researcher throughout the study, with clear demonstration of the impact that their input has on the research plans, are important.","Mitchell, Sarah J; Slowther, Anne-Marie; Coad, Jane; Khan, Dena; Samani, Mohini; Dale, Jeremy",Palliat Med,169,16

They state what is important in a profession. The aims of this study were to determine whether European countries have already developed (or are developing) documents on core values in family medicine; to gather the lists of core values already developed in countries; and to gather the opinions of participants on what the core family values in their countries are. Methods: This was a qualitative study. The questionnaire was distributed as an e-survey via email to present and former members of the European Society for Quality and Safety in Family Practice (EQuiP), and other family medicine experts in Europe. The questionnaire included six items concerning core values in family medicine in the respondent's country: the process of defining core values, present core values, the respondents' suggestions for core values, and current challenges of core values. Results: Core values in family medicine were defined or in a process of being defined in several European countries. The most common core values already defined were the doctor-patient relationship, continuity, comprehensiveness and holistic care, community orientation, and professionalism. Some countries expressed the need for an update of the current core values' list. Most respondents felt the core values of their discipline were challenged in today's world. The main values challenged were continuity, patient-centered care/the doctor-patient relationship and comprehensive and holistic care, but also prioritization, equity, and community orientation and cooperation. These were challenged by digital health, workload/lack of family physicians, fragmentation of care, interdisciplinary care, and societal trends and commercial interests. Conclusion: We managed to identify suggestions for core values of family medicine at the European level. There is a clear need to adopt a definition of a value and tailor the discussion and actions on the family medicine core values accordingly. There is also a need to identify the core values of family medicine in European countries. This could strengthen the profession, promote its development and research, improve education, and help European countries to advocate for the profession.","Arvidsson, Eva; Švab, Igor; Klemenc-Ketiš, Zalika",Front Med (Lausanne),169,32

Design: Parametric and non-parametric correlation coefficients are calculated to quantify the relationship between humidity and influenza, using five years of weekly data. Bayesian spatio-temporal models-with a Poisson and a Gaussian likelihood-are estimated to find the relationship between regional humidity and the daily cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the municipalities and provinces of the Netherlands. Results: An inverse (negative) relationship is observed between specific humidity and the incidence of influenza between 2015 and 2019. The space-time analysis indicates that an increase of specific humidity of one gram of water vapor per kilogram of air (1 g/kg) is related to a reduction of approximately 5% in the risk of COVID-19 infections. Conclusion: The increase in humidity during the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands helped to reduce the risk of regional COVID-19 infections. Public policies that promote higher levels of specific humidification-above 6 g/Kg-can lead to significant reductions in the spread of respiratory viruses, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2.","Ravelli, E.; Gonzales Martinez, R.",,169,20

However, false alarms may pose a significant burden to both patients and healthcare professionals alike. PURPOSE: To assess the false alarm rate and positive predictive value of smartphone-based home monitoring of nvAMD and DMO. METHODS: Patients treated with anti-angiogenic therapy in a pro re nata scheme for nvAMD or DMO at the Medical Retina service (Lucerne, Switzerland) between March and June 2016 were included in this prospective cohort study. The home monitoring test Alleye (Oculocare Ltd, Switzerland) provided a session score from 0–100 in addition to a traffic-light system feedback via the smartphone application. Three consecutive “red” scores were considered as a positive test or alarm signal. Specificity, 1-specificity (false alarm rate) and the predictive value for optical coherence tomography-based disease progression were analysed. RESULTS: 73 eyes of 56 patients performed 2258 tests in 222 “follow-up periods”. Progression was observed in 141 periods (63.5%). The specificity of the test was 93.8% (95% CI: 86.2–98.0%), the false alarm rate 6.1% (95% CI: 2.0–13.8%), and the positive predictive value 80.0% (95% CI: 59.3–93.2%) for the detection of progression. CONCLUSION: False alarm rates for the detection of progression in macular disease via home monitoring is low. These findings suggest that home monitoring may be a useful adjunct for remote management of nvAMD and DMO.","Faes, Livia; Islam, Meriam; Bachmann, Lucas M.; Lienhard, Kenny R.; Schmid, Martin K.; Sim, Dawn A.",Eye (Lond),169,20

The chapter tests the sensitivity and the selectivity of the SARS genosensor using complementary strands of SARS virus and three-base mismatch strands. Genosensor construction include following steps: a drop of 5 mL of 1.02 mM thiolated probe deposited on the gold film and maintain at 37°C for 20 min or at 41°C for 12 h; it is cleaned with 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer; further a15 mL drop of a 2% 1-hexanethiol solution is deposited on the gold film and maintained for 10 min and again cleaned with a 2×SSC buffer solution pH 7. From the results of hybridization assay and recording of the analytical signal no significant difference found between the analytical signal obtained for a 3.03nM solution of the complementary target strand and three-base mismatch strand. The limit of detection, calculated as the concentration corresponding to a signal which is three times the standard deviation of the intercept, results to be 5 pM. This means an improvement of various orders of magnitude when compared with limits of detection reported in the bibliography for DNA assays.","Abad-Valle, Patricia; Fernández-Abedul, María Teresa; Costa-García, Agustín",Comprehensive Analytical Chemistry,169,20

In addition to other potential explanations for the few cases and deaths of COVID-19 such as the population socio-demographics, early lockdown measures and the possibility of under reporting, we hypothesize in this mini review that individuals with a recent history of malaria infection may be protected against infection or severe form of COVID-19. Given that both the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) merozoites bind to the cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) immunoglobulin, we hypothesize that the immunological memory against P. falciparum merozoites primes SARS-CoV-2 infected cells for early phagocytosis, hence protecting individuals with a recent P. falciparum infection against COVID-19 infection or severity. This mini review therefore discusses the potential biological link between P. falciparum infection and COVID-19 infection or severity and further highlights the importance of CD147 immunoglobulin as an entry point for both SARS-CoV-2 and P. falciparum into host cells.","Kalungi, Allan; Kinyanda, Eugene; Akena, Dickens Howard; Kaleebu, Pontiano; Bisangwa, Innocent M.",Front Immunol,169,1

We have therefore investigated the safety and efficacy of megadose sodium ascorbate in sepsis. DESIGN: Interventional study. SETTING: Research Institute. SUBJECTS: Adult Merino ewes. INTERVENTIONS: Sheep were instrumented with pulmonary and renal artery flow-probes, and laser-Doppler and oxygen-sensing probes in the kidney. Conscious sheep received an infusion of live Escherichia coli for 31 hours. At 23.5 hours of sepsis, sheep received fluid resuscitation (30 mL/kg, Hartmann solution) and were randomized to IV sodium ascorbate (0.5 g/kg over 0.5 hr + 0.5 g/kg/hr for 6.5 hr; n = 5) or vehicle (n = 5). Norepinephrine was titrated to restore mean arterial pressure to baseline values (~80 mm Hg). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sepsis-induced fever (41.4 ± 0.2°C; mean ± se), tachycardia (141 ± 2 beats/min), and a marked deterioration in clinical condition in all cases. Mean arterial pressure (86 ± 1 to 67 ± 2 mm Hg), arterial Po(2) (102.1 ± 3.3 to 80.5 ± 3.4 mm Hg), and renal medullary tissue Po(2) (41 ± 5 to 24 ± 2 mm Hg) decreased, and plasma creatinine doubled (71 ± 2 to 144 ± 15 µmol/L) (all p < 0.01). Direct observation indicated that in all animals, sodium ascorbate dramatically improved the clinical state, from malaise and lethargy to a responsive, alert state within 3 hours. Body temperature (39.3 ± 0.3°C), heart rate (99.7 ± 3 beats/min), and plasma creatinine (32.6 ± 5.8 µmol/L) all decreased. Arterial (96.5 ± 2.5 mm Hg) and renal medullary Po(2) (48 ± 5 mm Hg) increased. The norepinephrine dose was decreased, to zero in four of five sheep, whereas mean arterial pressure increased (to 83 ± 2 mm Hg). We confirmed these physiologic findings in a coronavirus disease 2019 patient with shock by compassionate use of 60 g of sodium ascorbate over 7 hours.

Such a seemingly innocent question evokes concerns of type I and II errors among those who believe that certainty can be the product of uncertainty and among researchers who have been told that they need to carefully calculate sample sizes, consider multiplicity, and not spend P values on interim analyses. However, the endeavor to dichotomize evidence into significant and nonsignificant has led to the basic driving force of science, namely uncertainty, to take a back seat. In this viewpoint we discuss that if testing the null hypothesis is the ultimate goal of science, then we need not worry about writing protocols, consider ethics, apply for funding, or run any experiments at all—all null hypotheses will be rejected at some point—everything has an effect. The job of science should be to unearth the uncertainties of the effects of treatments, not to test their difference from zero. We also show the fickleness of P values, how they may one day point to statistically significant results; and after a few more participants have been recruited, the once statistically significant effect suddenly disappears. We show plots which we hope would intuitively highlight that all assessments of evidence will fluctuate over time. Finally, we discuss the remedy in the form of Bayesian methods, where uncertainty leads; and which allows for continuous decision making to stop or continue recruitment, as new data from a trial is accumulated.","Bendtsen, Marcus",J Med Internet Res,169,23

In the United States and Europe the mortality rate of elderly patients with COVID-19 is greater than 30%. Our aim is to determine predictors of COVID-19 related hospitalization and severity of disease among elderly Medicare patients in the United States. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including elderly Medicare COVID-19 patients across eight states. We collected data from the inpatient and outpatient electronic health record, demographic, clinical and echocardiographic predictors. Our primary outcomes were hospitalization and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our secondary outcome was mortality. RESULTS: We identified 400 COVID-19 positive patients (incidence 5.2; (95% CI 4.7-5.7) per 1000 patients). The mean age of our patients was 72+/-8, 60% were female, 82% were minorities and had a mean Charlson score of 2.9+/-1.4. Two-hundred and forty-four patients were hospitalized due to COVID-19 (63%) and the mortality rate was 18%; 95% CI 14-22 with 1 patient still in the hospital. Age, socioeconomic status, Charlson score, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, grade 2 or 3 diastolic dysfunction, moderate or severe left ventricular hypertrophy were significant predictors of hospitalization and ARDS (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports a lower incidence on a COVID-19 cohort than previously reported. Predictors of poor outcomes included socio-economic, cardiovascular risk and echocardiographic measures. High touch care with early cardiovascular risk factor modification could explain the low risk of events in our population.","Ghany, Reyan; Palacio, Ana; Chen, Gordon; Dawkins, Elissa; McCarter, Daniel; Forbes, Emancia; Chung, Brian; Tamariz, Leonardo",Am J Prev Cardiol,169,32

Design We used a large national multi-payer claims dataset from January 2019 through October 2020 to examine trends in post-hospital-discharge location and spending Setting and participants We identified and included 975,179 hospital discharges who were 65 years or older. Methods We summarized post-discharge utilization and spending in each month of the study: (1) the percentage of patients discharged from the hospital to home for selfcare and to the three common post-acute care locations: home with home health, skilled nursing facility (SNF) and inpatient rehabilitation; (2) the rate of discharge to each location per 100,000 insured members in our cohort; (3) the total amount spent per month in each post-acute care location; and (4) the percentage of spending in each post-acute care location out of the total spending across the three post-acute care settings. Results The percentage of patients discharged from the hospital to home or to inpatient rehabilitation did not meaningfully change during the pandemic while the percentage discharged to SNF declined from 19% of discharges in 2019 to 14% by October 2020. Total monthly spending declined in each of the three post-acute care locations, with the largest relative decline in SNFs of 55%, from an average of $42 million per month in 2019 to $19 million in October 2020. Declines in total monthly spending were smaller in home health (a 41% decline) and inpatient rehabilitation (a 32% decline).

Transmission of SARS occurred through direct and indirect contact and large droplet nuclei. The World Health Organization recommended the use of household disinfectants, which have not been previously tested against SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), to disinfect potentially contaminated environmental surfaces. There is a need for a surrogate test system given the limited availability of the SARS-CoV for testing and biosafety requirements necessary to safely handle it. In this study, the antiviral activity of standard household products was assayed against murine hepatitis virus (MHV), as a potential surrogate for SARS-CoV. METHODS: A surface test method, which involves drying an amount of virus on a surface and then applying the product for a specific contact time, was used to determine the virucidal activity. The virus titers and log reductions were determined by the Reed and Muench tissue culture infective dose (TCID)(50) end point method. RESULTS: When tested as directed, common household disinfectants or antiseptics, containing either 0.050% of triclosan, 0.12% of PCMX, 0.21% of sodium hypochlorite, 0.23% of pine oil, or 0.10% of a quaternary compound with 79% of ethanol, demonstrated a 3-log reduction or better against MHV without any virus recovered in a 30-second contact time. CONCLUSION: Common household disinfectants and antiseptics were effective at inactivating MHV, a possible surrogate for SARS-CoV, from surfaces when used as directed. In an outbreak caused by novel agents, it is important to know the effectiveness of disinfectants and antiseptics to prevent or reduce the possibility of human-to-human transmission via surfaces.","Dellanno, Christine; Vega, Quinn; Boesenberg, Diane",Am J Infect Control,169,26

The goal of this study is to project the number of COVID19 infections and resulting severe outcomes, and the need for hospital capacity under social distancing, particularly, shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine for the State of Georgia. We developed an agent-based simulation model to project the infection spread. The model utilizes COVID19-specific parameters and data from Georgia on population interactions and demographics. The simulation study covered a seven and a half-month period, testing different social distancing scenarios, including baselines (no-intervention or school closure only) and combinations of shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine with different timelines and compliance levels. The following outcomes are compared at the state and community levels: the number and percentage of cumulative and daily new symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths; COVID19-related demand for hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. The results suggest that shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine reduced peak infections from approximately 180K under no intervention and 113K under school closure, respectively, to below 53K, and delayed the peak from April to July or later. Increasing shelter-in-place duration from four to five weeks yielded 2-9% and 3-11% decrease in cumulative infection and deaths, respectively. Regardless of the shelter-in-place duration, increasing voluntary quarantine compliance decreased daily new infections from almost 53K to 25K, and decreased cumulative infections by about 50%. The cumulative number of deaths ranged from 6,660 to 19,430 under different scenarios. Peak infection date varied across scenarios and counties; on average, increasing shelter-in-place duration delayed the peak day by 6 days. Overall, shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine substantially reduced COVID19 infections, healthcare resource needs, and severe outcomes.","Keskinocak, Pinar; Aglar, Buse Eylul Oruc; Baxter, Arden; Asplund, John; Serban, Nicoleta",,169,16

This study aimed to evaluate the persistence of symptoms, lung function, and pulmonary diffusion for carbon monoxide (DLCO) in patients between 15 and 30 days after hospital discharge after admission for severe COVID-19. METHODS: The evaluation consisted of 1) comparative analysis between the initial symptoms and symptoms still present at the post-discharge evaluation 2) analysis of the chest images obtained during hospitalization, and 3) conducting spirometry, plethysmography, and DLCO assessment. RESULTS: Forty-one patients who were hospitalized for 16±8 days with severe COVID-19 were included. Patients were predominantly men (73%) and had a mean age of 51±14 years. The most frequent comorbidities were arterial hypertension (51%) and diabetes mellitus (37%). Pulmonary evaluation was performed a mean of 36 days after the onset of symptoms, with the most frequent persistent symptoms being dyspnea (83%) and coughing (54%). Approximately 93% of patients still had at least one symptom, and 20% had more than five symptoms. Chest imaging revealed a typical pattern of COVID-19 on X-ray (93%) and computer tomography (95%). Lung function test results showed a restrictive pattern with a reduction in forced vital capacity (FVC) in 54% of individuals, with an average FVC of 78±14%. A reduction in DLCO was observed in 79% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a high prevalence of symptoms, in addition to a significant change in lung function and DLCO, in the post-discharge assessment of patients requiring hospitalization after admission for COVID-19.","Polese, Jessica; Sant’Ana, Larissa; Moulaz, Isac Ribeiro; Lara, Izabella Cardoso; Bernardi, Julia Muniz; de Lima, Marina Deorce; Turini, Elaína Aparecida Silva; Silveira, Gabriel Carnieli; Duarte, Silvana; Mill, José Geraldo",Clinics (Sao Paulo),169,1

CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old man with a 19-year history of ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation presented with fever and arthralgia. Although the RT-PCR result was negative, a focal slit glass shadow in the left upper lobe on computed tomography (CT) suggested COVID-19 pneumonia.

LRRK2-linked PD is clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic PD and inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with reduced penetrance and variable expressivity that differ across ethnicities and geographic regions. Objective: To systematically assess clinical signs and symptoms including non-motor features, comorbidities, medication and environmental factors in PD patients, unaffected LRRK2 pathogenic variant carriers, and controls. A further focus is to enable the investigation of modifiers of penetrance and expressivity of LRRK2 pathogenic variants using genetic and environmental data. Methods: Eligible participants are invited for a personal or online examination which comprises completion of a detailed eCRF and collection of blood samples (to obtain DNA, RNA, serum/plasma, immune cells), urine as well as household dust. We plan to enroll 1,000 participants internationally: 300 with LRRK2-linked PD, 200 with LRRK2 pathogenic variants but without PD, 100 PD patients with pathogenic variants in the GBA or PRKN genes, 200 patients with idiopathic PD, and 200 healthy persons without pathogenic variants. Results: The eCRF consists of an investigator-rated (1 h) and a self-rated (1.5 h) part. The first part includes the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating, Hoehn &Yahr, and Schwab & England Scales, the Brief Smell Identification Test, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The self-rating part consists of a PD risk factor, food frequency, autonomic dysfunction, and quality of life questionnaires, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory, and the Epworth Sleepiness as well as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales. The first 15 centers have been initiated and the first 150 participants enrolled (as of March 25th, 2021). Conclusions: LIPAD is a large-scale international scientific effort focusing on deep phenotyping of LRRK2-linked PD and healthy pathogenic variant carriers, including the comparison with additional relatively frequent genetic forms of PD, with a future perspective to identify genetic and environmental modifiers of penetrance and expressivity Clinical Trial Registration:ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04214509.","Usnich, Tatiana; Vollstedt, Eva-Juliane; Schell, Nathalie; Skrahina, Volha; Bogdanovic, Xenia; Gaber, Hanaa; Förster, Toni M.; Heuer, Andreas; Koleva-Alazeh, Natalia; Csoti, Ilona; Basak, Ayse Nazli; Ertan, Sibel; Genc, Gencer; Bauer, Peter; Lohmann, Katja; Grünewald, Anne; Schymanski, Emma L.; Trinh, Joanne; Schaake, Susen; Berg, Daniela; Gruber, Doreen; Isaacson, Stuart H.; Kühn, Andrea A.; Mollenhauer, Brit; Pedrosa, David J.; Reetz, Kathrin; Sammler, Esther M.; Valente, Enza Maria; Valzania, Franco; Volkmann, Jens; Zittel, Simone; Brüggemann, Norbert; Kasten, Meike; Rolfs, Arndt; Klein, Christine",Front Neurol,169,28

Our unit is one of the departments in the region, at the forefront in treating head and neck cancers in Pakistan. We have continued treating these patients in the COVID-19 pandemic with certain modified protocols. The objective of this study is to share our experience and approach towards head and neck reconstruction during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: There were a total of 31 patients, 20 (64.5%) were males and 11 (35.4%) patients were females. The mean age of patients was 52 years. Patients presented with different pathologies, i.e. Squamous cell carcinoma n = 26 (83.8%), mucoepidermoid carcinoma n = 2 (6.4%), adenoid cystic carcinoma n = 2 (6.4%) and mucormycosis n = 1 (3%). The reconstruction was done with loco-regional flaps like temporalis muscle flap n = 12 (38.7%), Pectoralis major myocutaneous flap n = 8 (25.8%), supraclavicular artery flap n = 10 (32.2%) and combination of fore-head, temporalis major and cheek rotation flaps n = 1 (3%).

Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that “bidirectional” tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (R(eff)) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.","Bradshaw, William J.; Alley, Ethan C.; Huggins, Jonathan H.; Lloyd, Alun L.; Esvelt, Kevin M.",Nat Commun,169,1

This is best achieved with integrated care, which is based on the chronic care model of disease management, proactively addressing the patient’s unique medical, social, psychological, and cognitive needs along the trajectory of the disease. While conceptually appealing, integrated care requires not only a different approach to disease management, but considerably more health care resources. One potential way to reduce this burden of care is telemedicine: technology that allows for the bidirectional transfer of important clinical information between the patient and health care providers across distances. This not only makes medical services more accessible; it may also enhance the efficiency of delivery and quality of care. Telemedicine includes distinct, often overlapping interventions, including telecommunication (enhancing lines of communication), telemonitoring (symptom reporting or the transfer of physiological data to health care providers), physical activity monitoring and feedback to the patient and provider, remote decision support systems (identifying “red flags,” such as the onset of an exacerbation), tele-consultation (directing assessment and care from a distance), tele-education (through web-based educational or self-management platforms), tele-coaching, and tele-rehabilitation (providing educational material, exercise training, or even total pulmonary rehabilitation at a distance when standard, center-based rehabilitation is not feasible). While the above components of telemedicine are conceptually appealing, many have had inconsistent results in scientific trials. Interventions with more consistently favorable results include those potentially modifying physical activity, non-invasive ventilator management, and tele-rehabilitation. More inconsistent results in other telemedicine interventions do not necessarily mean they are ineffective; rather, more data on refining the techniques may be necessary. Until more outcome data are available clinicians should resist being caught up in novel technologies simply because they are new.","Donner, Claudio F.; ZuWallack, Richard; Nici, Linda",Medicina (Kaunas),169,16

If intraviral networks seem to behave similarly, they are clearly different from the human interactome. Viral proteins target highly central human proteins, which are precisely the Achilles' heel of the human interactome. The intrinsic structural disorder is a distinctive feature of viral hubs in virus-host interactomes. Overlaps between virus-host data sets identify a core of human proteins involved in the cellular response to viral infection and in the viral capacity to hijack the cell machinery for viral replication. Host proteins that are strongly targeted by a virus seem to be particularly attractive for other viruses.

Taken together, these data show that in HRV-1A infection, the 3A protein plays a role in fragmenting the Golgi complex and generating vesicles that are used as the site of viral RNA replication.","Quiner, Claire A.; Jackson, William T.",Virology,169,2

The reallocation of workforce and resources necessitated the postponement of elective operations in this cohort of high-risk patients. We investigated the impact of this outbreak on the aortic valve surgery activity at a single two-site centre in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Data were extracted from the local surgical database, including the demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of patients operated on from March 2020 to May 2020 with only one of the two sites resuming operative activity and compared with the respective 2019 period. A similar comparison was conducted with the period between June 2020 and August 2020, when operative activity was restored at both institutional sites. The experience of centres world-wide was invoked to assess the efficiency of our services. RESULTS: There was an initial 38.2% reduction in the total number of operations with a 70% reduction in elective cases, compared with a 159% increase in urgent and emergency operations. The attendant surgical risk was significantly higher [median Euroscore II was 2.7 [1.9–5.2] in 2020 versus 2.1 [0.9–3.7] in 2019 (p = 0.005)] but neither 30-day survival nor freedom from major post-operative complications (re-sternotomy for bleeding/tamponade, transient ischemic attack/stroke, renal replacement therapy) was compromised (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Recommencement of activity at both institutional sites conferred a surgical volume within 17% of the pre-COVID-19 era. CONCLUSIONS: Our institution managed to offer a considerable volume of aortic valve surgical activity over the first COVID-19 outbreak to a cohort of higher-risk patients, without compromising post-operative outcomes. A backlog of elective cases is expected to develop, the accommodation of which after surgical activity normalisation will be crucial to monitor.","Vlastos, Dimitrios; Chauhan, Ishaansinh; Mensah, Kwabena; Cannoletta, Maria; Asonitis, Athanasios; Elfadil, Ahmed; Petrou, Mario; De Souza, Anthony; Quarto, Cesare; Bhudia, Sunil K.; Rosendahl, Ulrich; Pepper, John; Asimakopoulos, George",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,169,20

In 2011, there was an ADHD diagnosis prevalence of around 8% among children (4-17 years) in the US. ADHD-affected children are more prone to physical injuries such as physical trauma, accidental poisoning, burns, etc. This study was aimed to evaluate the association of ADHD with severe injuries, the influence of age and gender on this association, and the impact of ADHD medications on the frequency of such injuries. Methodology This study was conducted in three governmental and three private settings in Aseer region. The files of children who were diagnosed with ADHD in the study settings were reviewed for a 12-month time period. Data were extracted from the medical files using a pre-structured data extraction sheet to avoid errors and inter-rater bias. The extracted data included child gender, age, duration of disease, and injury-related data. A brief questionnaire had been applied to mothers regarding mothers' attitudes towards injuries among their children, adherence to medications, as well as the reasons for non-adherence to medications and clinical visits in a non-adherent group during the clinic visit. Results One hundred and sixty-three children with a diagnosis of ADHD completed the study. The affected children were aged between two and 15 years (mean: 7.8 ± 2.9 years). An exact of 116 (71.2%) children were males. An exact of 70 (42.9%) affected children had trauma. The most-reported traumas were superficial injuries (84.3%), burns (48.6%), fractures (37.1%), deep injuries (31.4%), and broken or lost teeth (28.6%). About 52% of the children were adherent to medications and their clinical visits. Among the non-adherent group, the most reported reasons were parents’ care and attention (20.5%), followed by the COVID-19 pandemic and delay in visits times (16.7%). Regarding mothers' attitudes towards injuries among children with ADHD, 49.1% of the mothers agreed that there is an association between a child with ADHD and being traumatized while 22.7% said there was no relation. Conclusions In our cohort, the majority of the children with ADHD were boys at primary school age. Association of the history of the disease with trauma was not uncommon, and most injuries were not severe, but burns and deep injuries were reported among considered portions.","Alqarni, Mahdi M; Shati, Ayed A; Alassiry, Mohammed Z; Asiri, Waddah M.

DC.,12.210147,5.9218616,2021-07-20,"In the past few weeks, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has dramatically expanded across the world. To limit the spread of COVID-19 and its negative consequences, many countries have applied strict social distancing rules. In this dramatic situation, people with eating disorders are at risk of their disorder becoming more severe or relapsing. The risk comes from multiple sources including fears of infection and the effects of social isolation, as well as the limited availability of adequate psychological and psychiatric treatments. A potential practical solution to address some of these problems is to deliver enhanced cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT-E), an evidence-based treatment for all eating disorders, remotely. In this guidance we address three main topics. First, we suggest that CBT-E is suitable for remote delivery and we consider the challenges and advantages of delivering it in this way. Second, we discuss new problems that patients with eating disorders may face in this period. We also highlight potential opportunities for adapting some aspects of CBT-E to address them. Finally, we provide guidelines about how to adapt the various stages, strategies and procedures of CBT-E for teletherapy use in the particular circumstances of COVID-19. KEY LEARNING AIMS: (1).. To appreciate that CBT-E is suitable for remote delivery, and to consider the main challenges and potential advantages of this way of working. (2).. To identify and discuss the additional eating disorder-related problems that may arise as a result of COVID-19, as well as potential opportunities for adapting some aspects of CBT-E to address them. (3).. To learn how to adapt CBT-E for remote delivery to address the consequences of COVID-19. Specifically, to consider adaptations to the assessment and preparation phase, the four stages of treatment and its use with underweight patients and adolescents.","Murphy, Rebecca; Calugi, Simona; Cooper, Zafra; Dalle Grave, Riccardo",Cogn Behav Therap,169,24

Infection with M. tuberculosis (MTB), the pathogen that causes TB and latently infects ~25% of the global population, may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Objective: To determine if latent or active TB increase susceptibility to SARS-COV-19 infection and disease severity, and lead to more rapid development of COVID-19 pneumonia. Design: An observational case-control study of 36 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Shenyang, China, conducted in Feb 2020. Final date of follow-up: Feb 29, 2020. Cases were grouped according to COVID-19 pneumonia severity (mild/moderate, severe/critical), and MTB infection status compared. Comparisons were made with MTB infection data from another case-control study on bacterial/viral pneumonia at Shenyang Chest Hospital. Setting: Multi-center study involving three primary care hospitals in Shenyang, China. Participants: 86 suspected COVID-19 cases from participating primary-care hospitals in Shenyang. All 36 SARS-CoV-2 +ve cases (based on RT-PCR assay) were included. Disease severity was assessed using the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines of the National Health Commission of China (v6). Mean age, 47 years (range: 25-79), gender ratio, 1:1. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Interferon-gamma Release Assays (IGRA) were performed using peripheral blood to determine MTB infection. Main Outcome and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were collected. Comparison of MTB infection status between patients with mild/moderate and severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: Mean age of 36 COVID-19 patients: 47 (range: 25-79); M/F: 18/18; Wuhan/Hubei connection: 42%. Mild/moderate cases: 27 (75%); severe/critical: 9 (25%). MTB infection (IGRA+ve): 13 cases (36.11%), including 7 of 9 severe/critical cases. MTB infection rate: higher in COVID-19 (36.11%) than bacterial pneumonia (20%; p=0.0047) and viral pneumonia patients (16.13%; p=0.024). MTB infection more common than other co-morbidities (36.11% vs diabetes: 25%; hypertension: 22.2%; coronary heart disease: 8.33%; COPD: 5.56%). MTB co-infection linked with disease severity (severe/critical 78% vs mild/moderate cases 22%; p=0.0049), and rate of disease progression: infection to development of symptoms (MTB+SARS-CoV-2: 6.5+/-4.2 days vs SARS-COV-2: 8.9+/-5.2 days; p=0.073); from symptom development to diagnosed as severe (MTB+SARS-CoV-2: 3.4+/-2.0 days vs SARS-COV-2: 7.5+/-0.5 days; p=0.075). Conclusions and Relevance: MTB infection likely increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, and increases COVID-19 severity, but this requires validation in a larger study. MTB infection status of COVID-19 patients should be checked routinely at hospital admission.","Liu, Yongyu; Bi, Lijun; Chen, Yu; Wang, Yaguo; Fleming, Joy; Yu, Yanhong; Gu, Ye; Liu, Chang; Fan, Lichao; Wang, Xiaodan; Cheng, Moxin",,169,8

Diagnosis is central and is the first step in recognizing and fighting any infectious agent. Instrumental to that is the quality of the data, relying on serological and molecular surveys in addition to trustworthy clinical records. However, the fast spread of a virus adapted for human-to-human respiratory transmission raised a demand for millions of molecular tests that are simply not available. Several candidate drugs are under evaluation in clinical trials. Those with an already recognized safety profile are more auspicious, since, if proven effective, can cut several steps of production and phase 2 and 3 trials.

While systematic reviews of befriending have indicated positive benefits of befriending for people in a range of ages and settings, there have been no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of befriending for older people living in residential aged care with depression and no studies of the cost effectiveness of befriending in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) in Australia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are conducting a single blind pragmatic RCT comparing two groups of older people living in RACFs, one receiving an intervention consisting of weekly befriending for 4 months from a trained volunteer and the other receiving treatment as usual. Participants undergo eligibility screening for depression (GDS-15 ≥ 4) and cognitive impairment (GPCog ≥ 4) and assessments at three measurement time points: baseline prior to randomisation, 2 months post-baseline and 4 months post-baseline. The primary outcome measure is depression, and secondary outcome measures are anxiety, loneliness, social isolation and quality of life. The economic evaluation will take the form of a cost-utility analysis based on the outcome of quality of life. The primary and secondary outcomes will be analysed using negative binomial and logistic regressions utilizing the Generalised Estimating Equations approach. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first RCT evaluating the effectiveness of befriending on older people with depression living in residential aged care. It is expected that the befriending intervention will reduce the severity of depression symptoms experienced by older people living in residential aged care. If the intervention proves effective it may be incorporated into volunteer training programs and adopted as a way of supporting older people’s mental health.

Nonetheless, little is known about the host genetic contribution to the observed inter-individual phenotypic variability. Here, we report the first host genetic study in China by deeply sequencing and analyzing the 332 COVID-19 patients categorized by varying levels of severity from the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital. Based on a total of 22.2 million genetic variants, we conducted both single-variant and gene-based association tests among the five severity groups including asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe and critical ill patients after the correction of potential confounding factors. The most significant gene loci associated with severity is located in TMEM189-UBE2V1 involved in the IL-1 signaling pathway. The p.Val197Met missense variant that affects the stability of the TMPRSS2 protein displays a decreasing allele frequency among the severe patients compared to the mild and the general population. We also identified that the HLA-A*11:01, B*51:01 and C*14:02 alleles significantly predispose the worst outcome of the patients.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pandemic‐related factors on the severity and course of chronic urticaria (CU). A total of 194 CU patients who were on regular follow‐up, were enrolled in the study. The disease activity was assessed by means of the weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7) and urticaria control test (UCT). Patients were divided into two subgroups according to their disease aggravation as “aggravated” and “non‐aggravated”. Two groups were compared in terms of demographic, clinical, COVID‐19‐associated parameters, and parameters related with the effect of COVID‐19 pandemic on CU management. The omalizumab use was statistically higher (P = .017), and the systemic corticosteroid use was statistically lower (P = .025) in the “aggravated” group.

These differences reflect longstanding disparities in income, housing, air quality, preexisting health status, legal protections, and access to health care. The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences have made these ancient disparities plainly visible. METHODOLOGY: As scholars in Catholic research universities committed to advancing both scientific knowledge and social justice, we examined these disparities through the lenses of both epidemiology and ethics. FINDINGS: We see these widening disparities as not only as threats to human health, societal stability, and planetary health, but also as moral wrongs - outward manifestations of unrecognized privilege and greed. They are the concrete consequences of policies that promote structural violence and institutionalize racism. RECOMMENDATIONS: We encourage governments to take the following three scientific and ethical justified actions to reduce disparities, prevent future pandemics, and advance the common good: (1) Invest in public health systems; (2) Reduce economic inequities by making health care affordable to all; providing education, including early education, to all children; strengthening environmental and occupational safeguards; and creating more just tax structures; and (3) Preserve our Common Home, the small blue planet on which we all live.","Landrigan, Philip J.; Ferrer, Lilian; Keenan, James",Annals of global health,169,20

Cancer cells also change genetically, and current therapeutic techniques may be (or may become) ineffective in many cases. The pathology of many neurological diseases remains an enigma, and the exact etiology and underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. Viral infections spread and develop much more quickly than does the corresponding research needed to prevent and combat these infections; the present and most relevant outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, which originated in Wuhan, China, illustrates the critical and immediate need to improve drug design and development techniques. Modern day drug discovery is a time-consuming, expensive process. Each new drug takes in excess of 10 years to develop and costs on average more than a billion US dollars. This demonstrates the need of a complete redesign or novel strategies. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) has played a critical role in drug discovery ever since its introduction several decades ago. In just three decades, NMR has become a “gold standard” platform technology in medical and pharmacology studies. In this review, we present the major applications of NMR spectroscopy in medical drug discovery and development.

The main aim of this study was to use narrative medicine, a validated approach promoting quality of care to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the quality of care, quality of life, psychological factors and social factors of people affected by COPD and their caregivers and healthcare professionals (HCPs). A secondary aim was to explore the role of telemedicine in combating isolation and providing access to care. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational narrative medicine study was conducted between July and November 2020 across Italy. An online semi-structured questionnaire with a narrative plot was completed by 146 participants (79 COPD patients, 24 caregivers, and 43 HCPs). Narrations were analyzed with descriptive statistics and evaluated using NVivo 11 software to break down the text and identify recurring themes and major semantic clusters. RESULTS: During the first lockdown, 58.22% of responses from COPD patients indicated terror, fear and/or apprehension; at reopening, this figure was 35.44%. Among caregivers, these figures were 100% at first lockdown and 45.83% at reopening. The metaphors most commonly used by patients to describe COPD and COVID-19 were monster and murderer, respectively. Patients described their homes more often as clean and lonely than as offering no shelter. The narratives of 42 COPD patients (45.2%) described coping. Only 12.6% of COPD patients reported regular access to medical visits during lockdown, while 59.1% of general practitioners and pulmonologists reported using telemedicine, which was perceived as satisfactory by both patients and caregivers.

Female reproductive tract organs express coronavirus-associated receptors and factors (SCARFs); suggesting they may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection however the susceptibility of ovary/follicle/oocyte to the same is still elusive. Co-morbidities like obesity, type-2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease etc. increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These features are common in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), warranting further scope to study SCARFs expression in ovary of these women. Materials and methods: SCARFs expression in ovary and ovarian tissues of women with PCOS and healthy women was explored by analyzing publically available microarray datasets. Transcript expression of SCARFs were investigated in mural and cumulus granulosa cells (MGCs and CGCs) from control and PCOS women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Results: Microarray data revealed that ovary expresses all genes necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection. PCOS women mostly showed down-regulated/unchanged levels of SCARFs. MGCs and CGCs from PCOS women showed lower expression of receptors ACE2, BSG and DPP4 and protease CTSB than in controls. MGCs showed lower expression of protease CTSL in PCOS than in controls. Expression of TMPRSS2 was not detected in both cell types. Conclusions: Human ovarian follicle may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lower expression of SCARFs in PCOS indicate that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the ovary may be lesser in these women than controls. This knowledge may help in safe practices at IVF settings in the current pandemic. Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, Ovarian granulosa cells, Oocyte, PCOS, IVF","Naigaonkar, A. A.; Patil, K.

Initial data suggest that the virus has low mutation rates, but its large genome could facilitate recombination, insertions, and deletions, as has been described in other coronaviruses. Here, we deep-sequenced the complete SARS-CoV-2 S gene from 18 patients (10 with mild and 8 with severe COVID-19), and found that the virus accumulates deletions upstream and very close to the S1/S2 cleavage site, generating a frameshift with appearance of a stop codon. These deletions were found in a small percentage of the viral quasispecies (2.2%) in samples from all the mild and only half the severe COVID-19 patients. Our results suggest that the virus may generate free S1 protein released to the circulation. We propose that natural selection has favored a “Don’t burn down the house” strategy, in which free S1 protein may compete with viral particles for the ACE2 receptor, thus reducing the severity of the infection and tissue damage without losing transmission capability.","Andres, Cristina; Garcia-Cehic, Damir; Gregori, Josep; Piñana, Maria; Rodriguez-Frias, Francisco; Guerrero-Murillo, Mercedes; Esperalba, Juliana; Rando, Ariadna; Goterris, Lidia; Codina, Maria Gema; Quer, Susanna; Martín, Maria Carmen; Campins, Magda; Ferrer, Ricard; Almirante, Benito; Esteban, Juan Ignacio; Pumarola, Tomás; Antón, Andrés; Quer, Josep",bioRxiv,169,32

A still-debated percentage of patients develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after infection, whose symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue. Acute and life-threatening respiratory symptoms are experienced by 10-20% of symptomatic patients, particularly those with underlying medical conditions that includes diabetes, COPD and pregnancy. One of the main challenges in the containment of COVID-19 is the identification and isolation of asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic individuals. As communities re-open, large numbers of people will need to be tested and contact-tracing of positive patients will be required to prevent additional waves of infections and enable the continuous monitoring of the viral loads COVID-19 positive patients. A number of molecular assays are currently in clinical use to detect SARS-CoV-2. Many of them can accurately test hundreds or even thousands of patients every day. However, there are presently no testing platforms that enable more than 10,000 tests per day. Here, we describe the foundation for the REcombinase Mediated BaRcoding and AmplificatioN Diagnostic Tool (REMBRANDT), a high-throughput Next Generation Sequencing-based approach for the simultaneous screening of over 100,000 samples per day. The REMBRANDT protocol includes direct two-barcoded amplification of SARS-CoV-2 and control amplicons using an isothermal reaction, and the downstream library preparation for Illumina sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. This protocol represents a potentially powerful approach for community screening, a major bottleneck for testing samples from a large patient population for COVID-19.","Palmieri, Dario; Siddiqui, Jalal; Gardner, Anne; Fishel, Richard; Miles, Wayne O.",bioRxiv,169,1

Herein, we assessed the impact of COVID-19 on subthreshold depressive symptoms and identified potential mitigating factors. METHODS: Participants were from Depression Cohort in China (ChiCTR registry number 1900022145). Adults (n = 1722) with subthreshold depressive symptoms were enrolled between March and October 2019 in a 6-month, community-based interventional study that aimed to prevent clinical depression using psychoeducation. A total of 1506 participants completed the study in Shenzhen, China: 726 participants, who completed the study between March 2019 and January 2020 (i.e. before COVID-19), comprised the ‘wave 1’ group; 780 participants, who were enrolled before COVID-19 and completed the 6-month endpoint assessment during COVID-19, comprised ‘wave 2’. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia were assessed at baseline and endpoint (i.e. 6-month follow-up) using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), respectively. Measures of resilience and regular exercise were assessed at baseline. We compared the mental health outcomes between wave 1 and wave 2 groups. We additionally investigated how mental health outcomes changed across disparate stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, i.e. peak (7–13 February), post-peak (14–27 February), remission plateau (28 February−present). RESULTS: COVID-19 increased the risk for three mental outcomes: (1) depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04–1.62); (2) anxiety (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.16–1.88) and (3) insomnia (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07–1.77). The highest proportion of probable depression and anxiety was observed post-peak, with 52.9% and 41.4%, respectively. Greater baseline resilience scores had a protective effect on the three main outcomes (depression: OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.19–0.37; anxiety: OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.14–0.33 and insomnia: OR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.11–0.28). Furthermore, regular physical activity mitigated the risk for depression (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.79–0.99). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic exerted a highly significant and negative impact on symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia. Mental health outcomes fluctuated as a function of the duration of the pandemic and were alleviated to some extent with the observed decline in community-based transmission. Augmenting resiliency and regular exercise provide an opportunity to mitigate the risk for mental health symptoms during this severe public health crisis.","Liao, Y. H.; Fan, B. F.; Zhang, H.

The article reviews various neural network architectures applied to the gap-filling problem in motion capture sequences within the FBM framework providing a representation of body kinematic structure. The results are compared with interpolation and matrix completion methods. We found out that, for longer sequences, simple linear feedforward neural networks can outperform the other, sophisticated architectures, but these outcomes might be affected by the small amount of data availabe for training. We were also able to identify that the acceleration and monotonicity of input sequence are the parameters that have a notable impact on the obtained results.","Skurowski, Przemysław; Pawlyta, Magdalena",Sensors (Basel),169,6

Assessment of speech performance using picture naming tasks is a key method for both diagnosis and monitoring of responses to treatment interventions by people with aphasia (PWA). Currently, this assessment is conducted manually by speech and language therapists (SLT). Surprisingly, despite advancements in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and artificial intelligence with technologies like deep learning, research on developing automated systems for this task has been scarce. Here we present NUVA, an utterance verification system incorporating a deep learning element that classifies 'correct' versus' incorrect' naming attempts from aphasic stroke patients. When tested on eight native British-English speaking PWA the system's performance accuracy ranged between 83.6% to 93.6%, with a 10-fold cross-validation mean of 89.5%. This performance was not only significantly better than a baseline created for this study using one of the leading commercially available ASRs (Google speech-to-text service) but also comparable in some instances with two independent SLT ratings for the same dataset.","Barbera, David S.; Huckvale, Mark; Fleming, Victoria; Upton, Emily; Coley-Fisher, Henry; Doogan, Catherine; Shaw, Ian; Latham, William; Leff, Alexander P.; Crinion, Jenny",Comput Speech Lang,169,27
