13420,Association of Infectious Disease Physician Approval of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter With Appropriateness and Complications,2020-10-21,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a human pathogen of global concern, while a high diversity of viruses related to HBV have been discovered in other animals during the last decade. Recently, the novel mammalian hepadnavirus, tentatively named domestic cat hepadnavirus (DCH), was detected in an immunocompromised cat. Herein, a collection of 209 cat sera and 15 hepato-diseased cats were screened for DCH using PCR, resulting in 12.4% and 20% positivity in the tested sera and necropsied cats, respectively. Among the DCH-positive sera, a significantly high level of co-detection with retroviral infection was found, with the highest proportion being co-detection with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Full-length genome characterization of DCH revealed the genetic diversity between the nine Thai DCH sequences obtained, and that they phylogenetically formed three distinct monophyletic clades. A putative DCH recombinant strain was found, suggesting a possible role of recombination in DCH evolution. Additionally, quantitative PCR was used to determine the viral copy number in various organs of the DCH-moribund cats, while the pathological findings were compared to the viral localization in hepatocytes, adjacent to areas of hepatic fibrosis, by immunohistochemical (IHC) and western blot analysis. In addition to the liver, positive-DCH immunoreactivity was found in various other organs, including kidneys, lung, heart, intestine, brain, and lymph nodes, providing evidence of systemic infection. Ultrastructure of infected cells revealed electron-dense particles in the nucleus and cytoplasm of hepatocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. We propose the intracellular development mechanism of this virus. Although the definitive roles of pathogenicity of DCH remains undetermined, a contributory role of the virus associated with systemic diseases is possible.","Piewbang, Chutchai; Wardhani, Sabrina Wahyu; Chaiyasak, Surangkanang; Yostawonkul, Jakarwan; Chai-in, Poowadon; Boonrungsiman, Suwimon; Kasantikul, Tanit; Techangamsuwan, Somporn",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7584178/,647
14283,Resident Physician Experiences With and Responses to Biased Patients,2020-11-23,"Inhibiting cell survival and inducing cell death are the main approaches of tumor therapy. Autophagy plays an important role on intracellular metabolic homeostasis by eliminating dysfunctional or unnecessary proteins and damaged or aged cellular organelles to recycle their constituent metabolites that enable the maintenance of cell survival and genetic stability and even promotes the drug resistance, which severely limits the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs. Currently, targeting autophagy has a seemingly contradictory effect to suppress and promote tumor survival, which makes the effect of targeting autophagy on drug resistance more confusing and fuzzier. In the review, we summarize the regulation of autophagy by emerging ways, the action of targeting autophagy on drug resistance and some of the new therapeutic approaches to treat tumor drug resistance by interfering with autophagy-related pathways. The full-scale understanding of the tumor-associated signaling pathways and physiological functions of autophagy will hopefully open new possibilities for the treatment of tumor drug resistance and the improvement in clinical outcomes.","Chang, Haocai; Zou, Zhengzhi",J Hematol Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7687716/,647
14331,Association of Job Expectations Among High School Students With Early Death During Adulthood,2020-12-01,"Zika virus (ZIKV) can cause pregnancy loss and congenital Zika syndrome, among other poor health outcomes. The ZIKV epidemic in 2015–2017 disproportionately affected pregnant women in poor-resource settings. We aimed to understand perceptions and attitudes towards a hypothetical ZIKV vaccine, women’s willingness to be vaccinated, and potential barriers and facilitators for vaccine acceptance in 1) migrant women living in Spain who travelled to their countries of origin and were diagnosed with ZIKV infection during pregnancy, and their healthcare providers, and 2) women living in Colombia who delivered a child with microcephaly. An exploratory qualitative study based on phenomenology and grounded theory was conducted. Data were collected through in-depth, paired and semi-structured interviews. Overall, women from both sites were willing to receive a hypothetical ZIKV vaccine. However, some expressed concerns of being vaccinated during pregnancy, yet they would accept it if the vaccine was recommended by a healthcare professional they trust. Main fears towards vaccination were related to vaccine safety and potential adverse effects on child’s health. Women reported feeling hesitant to participate in a ZIKV vaccine trial. These results may contribute to guiding the effective delivery of future ZIKV vaccines among populations most at risk and particularly vulnerable.","Marbán-Castro, Elena; Villén-Gonzalvo, Ana; Enguita-Fernàndez, Cristina; Romero-Acosta, Kelly Carolina; Marín-Cos, Anna; Arrieta, Germán J.; Mattar, Salim; Menéndez, Clara; Maixenchs, Maria; Bardají, Azucena",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7711833/,647
14439,Perceptions of Parenting Challenges and Career Progression Among Physician Faculty at an Academic Hospital,2020-12-10,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the optimal vaccination strategies for the control of porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) caused by Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in case of early mycoplasmal infection. METHODS: A total of 120 pigs were randomly divided into 6 groups (20 pigs per group). Four separate vaccine regimen groups were selected. Pigs from the four vaccinated groups were challenged with M. hyopneumoniae at 28 days old followed by a challenge of PRRSV or PCV2 at 49 days old. RESULTS: Regardless of PRRSV or PCV2 vaccination, pigs vaccinated with one of the M. hyopneumoniae vaccines at 7 days old had a significantly better growth performance over the whole length of the study compared to pigs vaccinated with a second M. hyopneumoniae vaccine at 21 days old. Vaccination of pigs with M. hyopneumoniae at 7 days and PRRSV at either 7, 14 or 21 days old resulted in significantly reduced PRRSV viremia and lung lesions compared to vaccination of pigs with M. hyopneumoniae and PRRSV at 21 days old. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of the PRRSV MLV vaccine is influenced by the different timing of M. hyopneumoniae vaccination whereas the efficacy of the PCV2 vaccine is not. This experiment study demonstrated that early vaccination with a M. hyopneumoniae vaccine should be the highest priority in order to control M. hyopneumoniae and PRRSV infection in cases of early M. hyopneumoniae infection.","Yang, Siyeon; Oh, Taehwan; Mago, Josuke; Iwakuma, Akihiro; Chae, Chanhee",Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7738734/,647

15351,Association of Summer College Academic Enrichment Program Participation With Medical Student Diversity and Intent to Practice in Underserved Areas,2021-02-05,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has a history of nonhuman primate (NHP) consumption and exposure to simian retroviruses yet little is known about the extent of zoonotic simian retroviral infections in DRC. We examined the prevalence of human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV), a retrovirus group of simian origin, in a large population of persons with frequent NHP exposures and a history of simian foamy virus infection. We screened plasma from 3,051 persons living in rural villages in central DRC using HTLV EIA and western blot (WB). PCR amplification of HTLV tax and LTR sequences from buffy coat DNA was used to confirm infection and to measure proviral loads (pVLs). We used phylogenetic analyses of LTR sequences to infer evolutionary histories and potential transmission clusters. Questionnaire data was analyzed in conjunction with serological and molecular data. A relatively high proportion of the study population (5.4%, n = 165) were WB seropositive: 128 HTLV-1-like, 3 HTLV-2-like, and 34 HTLV-positive but untypeable profiles. 85 persons had HTLV indeterminate WB profiles. HTLV seroreactivity was higher in females, wives, heads of households, and increased with age. HTLV-1 LTR sequences from 109 persons clustered strongly with HTLV-1 and STLV-1 subtype B from humans and simians from DRC, with most sequences more closely related to STLV-1 from Allenopithecus nigroviridis (Allen’s swamp monkey). While 18 potential transmission clusters were identified, most were in different households, villages, and health zones. Three HTLV-1-infected persons were co-infected with simian foamy virus. The mean and median percentage of HTLV-1 pVLs were 5.72% and 1.53%, respectively, but were not associated with age, NHP exposure, village, or gender. We document high HTLV prevalence in DRC likely originating from STLV-1. We demonstrate regional spread of HTLV-1 in DRC with pVLs reported to be associated with HTLV disease, supporting local and national public health measures to prevent spread and morbidity.","Halbrook, Megan; Gadoth, Adva; Shankar, Anupama; Zheng, HaoQiang; Campbell, Ellsworth M.; Hoff, Nicole A.; Muyembe, Jean-Jacques; Wemakoy, Emile Okitolonda; Rimoin, Anne W.; Switzer, William M.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7872225/,647

15482,Association Between Caregiver Strain and Self-Care Among Caregivers With Diabetes,2021-02-11,"Purpose: Pneumonia is a respiratory disease with an increasing incidence in recent years. More and more studies have revealed that lncRNAs can regulate the transcriptional expression of target genes at different stage. Herein, we aimed to explore the effect of lncRNA MIAT in LPS-induced pneumonia, and further illuminate the possible underlying mechanisms. Method and results: Mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS, and the lung inflammation was evaluated. Microarray showed lncRNA MIAT was up-regulated in LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation. And qRT-PCR and FISH assay indicated that MIAT was increased in mice with LPS injection. Functional analysis showed sh-MIAT inhibited LPS-induced inflammation response, inhibited apoptosis level and protected lung function. As well, si-MIAT removed the injury of LPS on mouse lung epithelial TC-1 cells, and inhibited the activation of NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, MIAT acted as a sponge of miR-147a, and miR-147a directly targeted NKAP. Functionally, AMO-147a or NKAP remitted the beneficial effects of si-MIAT on LPS-induced inflammation response of TC-1 cells. Conclusion: Deletion of MIAT protected against LPS-induced lung inflammation via regulating miR-147a/NKAP, which might provide new insight for pneumonia treatment.","Liu, Min; Li, Weixin; Song, Fuxing; Zhang, Ling; Sun, Xianjun",Aging (Albany NY),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7880384/,647
16500,Evaluation of State Cannabis Laws and Rates of Self-harm and Assault,2021-03-18,"Ebola virus (EBOV) is one of the most virulent pathogens that causes hemorrhagic fever and displays high mortality rates and low prognosis rates in both humans and nonhuman primates. The post-exposure antibody therapies to prevent EBOV infection are considered effective as of yet. However, owing to the poor thermal stability of mammalian antibodies, their application in the tropics has remained limited. Therefore, a thermostable therapeutic antibody against EBOV was developed modelled on the poultry(chicken) immunoglobulin Y (IgY). The IgY antibodies retaining their neutralising activity at 25°C for one year, displayed excellent thermal stability, opposed to conventional polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Laying hens were immunised with a variety of EBOV vaccine candidates and it was confirmed that VSVΔG/EBOVGP encoding the EBOV glycoprotein could induce high titer neutralising antibodies against EBOV. The therapeutic efficacy of immune IgY antibodies in vivo was evaluated in the newborn Balb/c mice who have been challenged with the VSVΔG/EBOVGP model. Mice that have been challenged with a lethal dose of the pseudovirus were treated 2 or 24 h post-infection with different doses of anti-EBOV IgY. The group receiving a high dose of 10(6) NAU/kg (neutralising antibody units/kilogram) showed complete protection with no symptoms of a disease, while the low-dose group was only partially protected. Conversely, all mice receiving naive IgY died within 10 days. In conclusion, the anti-EBOV IgY exhibits excellent thermostability and protective efficacy. Anti-EBOV IgY shows a lot of promise in entering the realm of efficient Ebola virus treatment regimens.","Zhang, Yuan; Wei, Yanqiu; Li, Yunlong; Wang, Xuan; Liu, Yang; Tian, Deyu; Jia, Xiaojuan; Gong, Rui; Liu, Wenjun; Yang, Limin",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7990235/,647
16817,Prevalence of Medical Journal Websites That Deny Access to Users Who Block Browser Cookies,2021-03-26,"Neuralgic amyotrophy (NA) is markedly underdiagnosed in clinical practice, and its actual incidence rate is about 1 per 1000 per year. In the current article, we provide an overview of essential information about NA, including the etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic investigations, differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. The causes of NA are multifactorial and include immunological, mechanical, or genetic factors. Typical clinical findings are a sudden onset of pain in the shoulder region, followed by patchy flaccid paralysis of muscles in the shoulder and/or arm. A diagnosis of NA is based on a patient’s clinical history and physical examination. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography are useful for confirming the diagnosis and choosing the appropriate treatment. However, before a diagnosis of NA is confirmed, other disorders with similar symptoms, such as cervical radiculopathy or rotator cuff tear, need to be ruled out. The prognosis of NA depends on the degree of axonal damage. In conclusion, many patients with motor weakness and pain are encountered in clinical practice, and some of these patients will exhibit NA. It is important that clinicians understand the key features of this disorder to avoid misdiagnosis.","Kim, Tae Uk; Chang, Min Cheol",J Int Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8033465/,647
17209,Comparison of General Surgical Practice Size and Setting in 2017 vs 2013 in the US,2021-04-28,"Determining sensitive drugs for a patient is one of the most critical problems in precision medicine. Using genomic profiles of the tumor and drug information can help in tailoring the most efficient treatment for a patient. In this paper, we proposed a classification machine learning approach that predicts the sensitive/resistant drugs for a cell line. It can be performed by using both drug and cell line similarities, one of the cell line or drug similarities, or even not using any similarity information. This paper investigates the influence of using previously defined as well as two newly introduced similarities on predicting anti-cancer drug sensitivity. The proposed method uses max concentration thresholds for assigning drug responses to class labels. Its performance was evaluated using stratified five-fold cross-validation on cell line-drug pairs in two datasets. Assessing the predictive powers of the proposed model and three sets of methods, including state-of-the-art classification methods, state-of-the-art regression methods, and off-the-shelf classification machine learning approaches shows that the proposed method outperforms other methods. Moreover, The efficiency of the model is evaluated in tissue-specific conditions. Besides, the novel sensitive associations predicted by this model were verified by several supportive evidence in the literature and reliable database. Therefore, the proposed model can efficiently be used in predicting anti-cancer drug sensitivity.

17232,Association of Cigarette Type Initially Smoked With Suicidal Behaviors Among Adolescents in Korea From 2015 to 2018,2021-04-30,"ABSTRACT: N-linked glycosylation plays critical roles in folding, receptor binding, and immunomodulating of hemagglutinin (HA), the main antigen in influenza vaccines. Chicken embryos are the predominant production host for influenza vaccines, but Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells have emerged as an important alternative host. In this study, we compared glycosylation patterns, including the occupancy of potential glycosylation sites and the distribution of different glycans, on the HAs of three strains of influenza viruses for the production a trivalent seasonal flu vaccine for the 2015-2016 Northern Hemisphere season (i.e., A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) X179A, A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2) NIB-88, and B/Brisbane/60/2008 NYMC BX-35###). Of the 8, 12, and 11 potential glycosylation sites on the HAs of H1N1, H3N2, and B strains, respectively, most were highly occupied. For the H3N2 and B strains, MDCK-derived HAs contained more sites being partially occupied (<95%) than embryo-derived HAs. A highly sensitive glycan assay was developed where 50 different glycans were identified, which was more than what has been reported previously, and their relative abundance was quantified. In general, MDCK-derived HAs contain more glycans of higher molecular weight. High-mannose species account for the most abundant group of glycans, but at a lower level as compared to those reported in previous studies, presumably due to that lower abundance, complex structure glycans were accounted for in this study. The different glycosylation patterns between MDCK- and chicken embryo-derived HAs may help elucidate the role of glycosylation on the function of influenza vaccines. KEY POINTS: • For the H3N2 and B strains, MDCK-derived HAs contained more partially (<95%) occupied glycosylation sites. • MDCK-derived HAs contained more glycans of higher molecular weight. • A systematic comparison of glycosylation on HAs used for trivalent seasonal flu vaccines was conducted.

18159,"Characteristics of e-Cigarette Use Behaviors Among US Youth, 2020",2021-06-07,"IMPORTANCE: Physicians are exposed to traumatic events during their work, but the impact and outcomes of these exposures are understudied. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and associations of work-related trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among a cohort of resident physicians in their internship year of training. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study involved physicians entering internship at US residency programs nationwide in 2018. Participants completed a baseline survey 1 to 2 months before commencing internship, as well as follow-up surveys at 4 time points during internship. Statistical analysis was performed from April 2020 to January 2021. EXPOSURES: Twelve months of internship. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of work-related trauma and prevalence of PTSD among those who experienced work-related trauma. Trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Primary Care PTSD Screen for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) (PC-PTSD-5). Risk factors assessed included depression, anxiety, early family environment, stressful life experiences, medical specialty, hours worked, and concern about medical errors. RESULTS: Among 1134 interns who completed the PC-PTSD-5 at month 12 of internship, 665 (58.6%) were female and 695 (61.6%) were non-Hispanic White; the mean (SD) age was 27.52 (2.50) years. There were 640 interns (56.4%) who reported work-related trauma exposure; among these interns with trauma exposure, 123 (19.0%) screened positive for PTSD. Overall, 123 of 1134 training physicians (10.8%) screened positive for PTSD by the end of internship year, as compared with a 12-month PTSD prevalence rate of 3.6% in the general population. Multivariable logistic regression analyses, adjusting for demographic characteristics, indicated that risk factors associated with trauma exposure included non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity (odds ratio [OR], 1.51 [95% CI, 1.14-2.01]; P = .004), more hours worked (OR, 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00-1.03]; P = .03), early family environment (OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.01-1.05]; P < .001), and stressful life experiences at baseline (OR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.06-2.01]; P = .02). Risk factors associated with PTSD were being unmarried (OR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.07-3.73]; P = .03) and non-Hispanic White (OR, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.01-3.11]; P = .05), concern about medical errors (OR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.00-1.46]; P = .05), stressful life experiences during internship (OR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.14-1.81]; P = .002), depression at month 12 of internship (OR, 2.52 [95% CI = 1.36-4.65], P = .003), and anxiety at month 12 of internship (OR, 2.14, [95% CI, 1.13-4.04]; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that work-related PTSD was 3 times more prevalent among intern physicians than the general population. These findings suggest that effective interventions to reduce trauma exposure and mitigate the effects of trauma are needed.","Vance, Mary C.; Mash, Holly B.

Therefore, learning more about their posts and activities is instrumental in effectively reacting and responding to the false information they publish, which is aimed at discouraging people from taking vaccines. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to gather, assess, and synthesize evidence related to the current state of knowledge about antivaccine social media users’ web-based activities. METHODS: We systematically reviewed English-language papers from 3 databases (Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed). A data extraction form was established, which included authors, year of publication, specific objectives, study design, comparison, and outcomes of significance. We performed an aggregative narrative synthesis of the included studies. RESULTS: The search strategy retrieved 731 records in total. After screening for duplicates and eligibility, 18 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. Although most of the authors analyzed text messages, some of them studied images or videos. In addition, although most of the studies examined vaccines in general, 5 focused specifically on human papillomavirus vaccines, 2 on measles vaccines, and 1 on influenza vaccines. The synthesized studies dealt with the popularity of provaccination and antivaccination content, the style and manner in which messages about vaccines were formulated for the users, a range of topics concerning vaccines (harmful action, limited freedom of choice, and conspiracy theories), and the role and activity of bots in the dissemination of these messages in social media. CONCLUSIONS: Proponents of the antivaccine movement use a limited number of arguments in their messages; therefore, it is possible to prepare publications clarifying doubts and debunking the most common lies. Public health authorities should continuously monitor social media to quickly find new antivaccine arguments and then create information campaigns for both health professionals and other users.","Wawrzuta, Dominik; Jaworski, Mariusz; Gotlib, Joanna; Panczyk, Mariusz",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8214178/,647
19017,"Adherence to Follow-up Testing Recommendations in US Veterans Screened for Lung Cancer, 2015-2019",2021-07-08,"Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) isoforms exert intricate effects on cellular physiology beyond lipid transport and metabolism. ApoEs influence the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in an isoform-dependent manner: ApoE4 increases AD risk, while ApoE2 decreases it. Previously we demonstrated that syndecans, a transmembrane proteoglycan family with increased expression in AD, trigger the aggregation and modulate the cellular uptake of amyloid beta (Aβ). Utilizing our previously established syndecan-overexpressing cellular assays, we now explore how the interplay of ApoEs with syndecans contributes to key events, namely uptake and aggregation, in Aβ pathology. The interaction of ApoEs with syndecans indicates isoform-specific characteristics arising beyond the frequently studied ApoE–heparan sulfate interactions. Syndecans, and among them the neuronal syndecan-3, increased the cellular uptake of ApoEs, especially ApoE2 and ApoE3, while ApoEs exerted opposing effects on syndecan-3-mediated Aβ uptake and aggregation. ApoE2 increased the cellular internalization of monomeric Aβ, hence preventing its extracellular aggregation, while ApoE4 decreased it, thus helping the buildup of extracellular plaques. The contrary effects of ApoE2 and ApoE4 remained once Aβ aggregated: while ApoE2 reduced the uptake of Aβ aggregates, ApoE4 facilitated it. Fibrillation studies also revealed ApoE4′s tendency to form fibrillar aggregates. Our results uncover yet unknown details of ApoE cellular biology and deepen our molecular understanding of the ApoE-dependent mechanism of Aβ pathology.","Hudák, Anett; Jósvay, Katalin; Domonkos, Ildikó; Letoha, Annamária; Szilák, László; Letoha, Tamás",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8268055/,647

METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional study. Children with syndromic and non-syndromic craniosynostosis 0 to 18 years of age were recruited between February 13, 2020, and October 1, 2020. Main outcome measures included feasibility (patient recruitment and handheld OCT success rates) and repeatability, which were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) where repeated images of the optic nerve head (ONH) within the same visit were available. ONH parameters used for repeatability analysis included cup depth, width, and area; disc width; rim height; retinal thickness; retinal nerve fiber layer thickness; and Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width. RESULTS: Fifty children were approached, and all 50 (100%) were successfully recruited. Median age was 51.1 months (range, 1.9–156.9; interquartile range, 37.0–74.2), and 33 of the children (66%) were male. At least one ONH image was obtained in 43 children (86%), and bilateral ONH imaging was successful in 38 children (76%). Factors boosting the likelihood of success included good understanding and cooperation of the child and parent/guardian and availability of an assistant. Repeatability analysis was performed in 20 children, demonstrating good repeatability (ICC range, 0.77–0.99; the majority exceeded 0.90). OCT correctly identified two cases of intracranial hypertension, one of which was undetected by prior fundoscopy.

However, the immunological basis for the adjuvant effects of DEP in allergic rhinitis (AR) remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of DEP exposure on AR using a mouse model. BALB/c mice sensitized to house dust mite (HDM) were intranasally challenged with HDM in the presence and absence of DEP. Allergic symptom scores, serum total and HDM-specific immunoglobulins (Igs), eosinophil infiltration in the nasal mucosa, cytological profiles in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and cytokine levels in the nasal mucosa and spleen cell culture were analyzed. Mice co-exposed to HDM and DEP showed increased allergic symptom scores compared with mice exposed to HDM alone. Reduced total IgE and HDM-specific IgE and IgG1 levels, decreased eosinophil infiltration in the nasal mucosa, and increased proportion of neutrophils in BALF were found in mice co-exposed to HDM and DEP. Interleukin (IL)-17A level was found to be increased in the nasal mucosa of the co-exposure group compared with that in the HDM-exposed group.

20024,Association of a Fruit and Vegetable Subsidy Program With Food Purchases by Individuals With Low Income in the US,2021-08-11,"Purpose: Our objective is to identify the predictive factors and predict hospital length of stay (LOS) in dengue patients, for efficient utilization of hospital resources. Methods: We collected 1360 medical patient records of confirmed dengue infection from 2012 to 2017 at Max group of hospitals in India. We applied two different data mining algorithms, logistic regression (LR) with elastic-net, and random forest to extract predictive factors and predict the LOS. We used an area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity to evaluate the performance of the classifiers. Results: The classifiers performed well, with logistic regression (LR) with elastic-net providing an AUC score of 0.75 and random forest providing a score of 0.72. Out of 1148 patients, 364 (32%) patients had prolonged length of stay (LOS) (> 5 days) and overall hospitalization mean was 4.03 ± 2.44 days (median ± IQR). The highest number of dengue cases belonged to the age group of 10-20 years (21.1%) with a male predominance. Moreover, the study showed that blood transfusion, emergency admission, assisted ventilation, low haemoglobin, high total leucocyte count (TLC), low or high haematocrit, and low lymphocytes have a significant correlation with prolonged LOS. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that the logistic regression with elastic-net was the best fit with an AUC of 0.75 and there is a significant association between LOS greater than five days and identified patient-specific variables. This method can identify the patients at highest risks and help focus time and resources.

20044,Clinician Conceptualization of the Benefits of Treatments for Individual Patients,2021-07-21,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is a pandemic, being one of the top 10 causes of death and the main cause of death from a single source of infection. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the most common and serious side effect during the treatment of TB. OBJECTIVE: We aim to predict the status of liver injury in patients with TB at the clinical treatment stage. METHODS: We designed an interpretable prediction model based on the XGBoost algorithm and identified the most robust and meaningful predictors of the risk of TB-DILI on the basis of clinical data extracted from the Hospital Information System of Shenzhen Nanshan Center for Chronic Disease Control from 2014 to 2019. RESULTS: In total, 757 patients were included, and 287 (38%) had developed TB-DILI. Based on values of relative importance and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, machine learning tools selected patients’ most recent alanine transaminase levels, average rate of change of patients’ last 2 measures of alanine transaminase levels, cumulative dose of pyrazinamide, and cumulative dose of ethambutol as the best predictors for assessing the risk of TB-DILI. In the validation data set, the model had a precision of 90%, recall of 74%, classification accuracy of 76%, and balanced error rate of 77% in predicting cases of TB-DILI. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score upon 10-fold cross-validation was 0.912 (95% CI 0.890-0.935). In addition, the model provided warnings of high risk for patients in advance of DILI onset for a median of 15 (IQR 7.3-27.5) days. CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows high accuracy and interpretability in predicting cases of TB-DILI, which can provide useful information to clinicians to adjust the medication regimen and avoid more serious liver injury in patients.","Zhong, Tao; Zhuang, Zian; Dong, Xiaoli; Wong, Ka Hing; Wong, Wing Tak; Wang, Jian; He, Daihai; Liu, Shengyuan",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8335604/,647

Increasing the genetic diversity of crop species is essential to improve their yield and enhance food security. Synthetic directed evolution (SDE) employs localized sequence diversification (LSD) of gene sequence and selection pressure to evolve gene variants with better fitness, improved properties and desired phenotypes. Recently, CRISPR–Cas-dependent and -independent technologies have been applied for LSD to mediate synthetic evolution in diverse species, including plants. SDE holds excellent promise to discover, accelerate and expand the range of traits of the value in crop species. Here, we highlight the efficient SDE approaches for the LSD of plant genes, selection strategies and critical traits for targeted improvement. We discuss the potential of emerging technologies, including CRISPR–Cas base editing, retron editing, EvolvR and prime editing, to establish efficient SDE in plants. Moreover, we cover CRISPR–Cas-independent technologies, including T7 polymerase editor for continuous evolution.

This study aimed to review studies in Iran on resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax to drugs, and to reveal the mechanisms and molecular markers of resistance of these two species. METHODS: The databases of PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Magiran, and reputable Iranian journals were searched to find published studies on the resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax to antimalarial drugs in Iran. RESULTS: There is a significant relationship between resistance to chloroquine in P. falciparum and the emergence of K76T mutation in the P. falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter gene in Iran. Resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in P. falciparum is also significantly associated with the development of mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase genes. Resistance to chloroquine in P. vivax has not been reported in Iran and it is used as a first-line treatment for P. vivax malaria. CONCLUSION: P. falciparum has become resistant to chloroquine in different regions of Iran and is not currently used to treat malaria. Besides, cases have emerged of P. falciparum resistance to SP in different parts of southern Iran, and SP is not administered alone for treating P. falciparum.","Heidari, Aliehsan; Keshavarz, Hossein",Iran J Parasitol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8418652/,647

Here, we determined the progression of the plasma lipidome among Gambian children (n = 409) and assessed its association with growth faltering during the first 2 years of life using the panel vector autoregression method. We further investigated temporal associations among lipid clusters. We observed that measures of stunting, wasting, and underweight are dynamically associated with each other and that lipid groups containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and phosphatidylcholines consistently predict future growth outcomes. Linear growth was dynamically associated with the majority of lipids, indicating a higher nutritional demand to improve height compared to weight among growth-restricted children. Our results indicate a critical role for PUFAs and choline in early life dietary interventions to combat the child growth faltering still so prevalent in low-income settings.","Gonzales, Gerard Bryan; Brals, Daniella; Sonko, Bakary; Sosseh, Fatou; Prentice, Andrew M.; Moore, Sophie E.; Koulman, Albert",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8448443/,647
21912,Association of Online Risk Factors With Subsequent Youth Suicide-Related Behaviors in the US,2021-09-20,"INTRODUCTION: For people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who require an antidiabetic drug as an add-on to metformin, there is controversy about whether newer drug classes such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) or sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce the risk of long-term complications compared with sulfonylureas (SU). There is widespread variation across National Health Service Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in drug choice for second-line treatment in part because National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines do not specify a single preferred drug class, either overall or within specific patient subgroups. This study will evaluate the relative effectiveness of the three most common second-line treatments in the UK (SU, DPP4i and SGLT2i as add-ons to metformin) and help target treatments according to individual risk profiles. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study includes people with T2DM prescribed one of the second-line treatments-of-interest between 2014 and 2020 within the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked with Hospital Episode Statistics and Office of National Statistics. We will use an instrumental variable (IV) method to estimate short-term and long-term relative effectiveness of second-line treatments according to individuals’ risk profiles. This method minimises bias from unmeasured confounders by exploiting the natural variation in second-line prescribing across CCGs as an IV for the choice of prescribed treatment. The primary outcome to assess short-term effectiveness will be change in haemoglobin A1c (%) 12 months after treatment initiation. Outcome measures to assess longer-term effectiveness (maximum ~6 years) will include microvascular and macrovascular complications, all-cause mortality and hospital admissions during follow-up.

Many find end‐of‐life care decisions particularly difficult. The aim of this article is to present an evidence‐ and theoretical‐based process for developing a decision aid to support family carers of people with dementia towards the end‐of‐life. METHODS: Following a systematic process, we developed a decision aid using coproduction methods and matrices to synthesize data from a systematic review and qualitative interviews with people living with dementia and family carers. Data were presented to coproduction workshops of people living with dementia, family carers, practitioners and professionals. Development was guided by the Ottawa Decision Support Framework and a modified Interprofessional Shared Decision‐Making model. RESULTS: The decision aid covers four decision areas: (1) changes in care; (2) eating and drinking difficulties; (3) everyday well‐being; and (4) healthcare, tests and medication. We present an interactive decision aid, using a variety of approaches including written text, Frequently Asked Questions, top tips and illustrative quotes from people living with dementia and family carers. CONCLUSION: This is the first decision aid that focusses on multiple decisions towards the end‐of‐life in dementia care. The process offers a template for others to develop decision aids or similar interventions, and how to include people living with dementia in coproduction.

PATIENTS AND METHODS 164 COVID-19 suspected patients were from the Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University. Oropharyngeal swab specimens were acquired by respiratory doctors under standardized conditions. Specific nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, along with pneumonic mycoplasma were detected by real-time fluorescence PCR. Symptomatic, epidemiologic, laboratory and radiological data of the patients were obtained from the electronic medical record system of our hospital. RESULTS Among the 164 patients, 3 were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 15 were positive for other respiratory viruses and 16 were positive for pneumonic mycoplasma. Of the positive patients above, 1 patient was co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 and adenovirus, and 1 was co-infected with influenza B and pneumonic mycoplasma. The 3 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were clinically diagnosed as COVID-19 because they meet the diagnostic criteria listed in ""Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia diagnosis and treatment"", including epidemic history, symptom and pathogenic detection, as well as abnormalities of the laboratory and radiological data. However, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients were non-specific compared to those of the patients infected with other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS The endemic common respiratory pathogens are more prevalent than SARS-CoV-2 in the SARS-CoV-2 non-epidemic areas of this research.

Yet, after decades of research on the occurrence and the toxicity of Alternaria toxins in academia, no regulation has been implemented yet, thus leaving these potential food contaminants in the status of so-called ""emerging mycotoxins"". However, research on this topic has been far from static, leading to the European Food Safety Authority repeatedly calling for more data on the occurrence and toxicity of genotoxic metabolites such as alternariol (AOH) and its monomethyl ether (AME). To give an overview on recent developments in the field, this comprehensive review summarizes published data and addresses current challenges arising from the chemical complexity of Alternaria's metabolome, mixture effects and the emergence of novel biological targets like cell membranes or the interaction with different receptors. Besides toxicodynamics, we review recent research on toxicokinetics, including the first in vivo studies which incorporated the rarely investigated-but highly genotoxic-perylene quinones. Furthermore, a particular focus lies on the advances of liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based analytical tools for determining a broader spectrum of Alternaria toxins including modified/masked forms and assessing exposure via human biomonitoring (HBM).","Aichinger, Georg; Del Favero, Giorgia; Warth, Benedikt; Marko, Doris",Comprehensive reviews in food science and food safety,https://doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.12803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323368/,647

We aimed to evaluate whether aerobic exercise (i.e., walking combined with jogging) improves objective sleep parameters among female nurses who met eligibility criterion as poor sleepers at the end of an 8-week exercise program and 4 weeks after study completion. This single-blinded, parallel-design, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a classroom of a hospital in northern Taiwan. Sixty eligible female nurses were randomly assigned to either the aerobic exercise (n = 30) or usual activity status (n = 30) group. A moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program was administered over 5 days (60 min per day) a week for 8 weeks after the nurses' day shifts. Objective sleep outcomes including total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE) were retrieved using an actigraph device. A generalized estimating equation model was used for data analysis. The aerobic exercise group exhibited improvements in TST and SE at 4 and 8 weeks compared with the baseline evaluation (TST: B = 70.49 and 55.96; SE: B = 5.21 and 3.98). Between-group differences were observed in SOL and WASO at 4 weeks but not 8 weeks compared with the baseline evaluation (SOL: B = -7.18; WASO: B = -11.38).

At New York Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, we needed to develop an innovative system of how to safely discharge the massive influx of patients. Inundation of patient care with limited manpower and resources forced us to align with a third-party vendor, around-the-clock alert, to make remote patient monitoring (RPM) possible. Each patient was prescribed a pulse oximeter and nurses were assigned to monitor vital signs, speak to patients, and escalate to physicians if required. Results: We enrolled 50 patients, of whom 13 were escalated resulting in 3 emergency room visits and 1 readmission. We had a high compliance rate with high patient satisfaction in postsurveys. Discussion: Our program was unique in that it utilized telemedicine for regular patient follow-up, along with RPM through a third-party vendor. Patients were able to be safely discharged home with close follow-up through regularly obtained vitals with access to a 24/7 hotline for any emergencies, possibly preventing readmissions. Limitations include a small sample size population. Conclusions: Our experience shows that in a short period despite lack of resources, telehealth and RPM's concurrent use with a third-party vendor could be successfully utilized for safe discharges with high patient satisfaction.","Kodama, Rich; Arora, Sunny; Anand, Swati; Choudhary, Abu; Weingarten, Jeremy; Francesco, Notar; Chiricolo, Gerardo; Silber, Steven; Mehta, Parag H",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33320031/,647

The immediate effects of a nationwide lockdown were investigated by comparing matched samples of New Zealanders assessed before (Nprelockdown = 1,003) and during the first 18 days of lockdown (Nlockdown = 1,003). Two categories of outcomes were examined: (a) institutional trust and attitudes toward the nation and government and (b) health and well-being. Applying propensity score matching to approximate the conditions of a randomized controlled experiment, the study found that people in the pandemic/lockdown group reported higher trust in science, politicians, and police, higher levels of patriotism, and higher rates of mental distress compared to people in the prelockdown prepandemic group. Results were confirmed in within-subjects analyses.

77387,Ultrastructural Evidence of Direct Viral Damage to the Olfactory Complex in Patients Testing Positive for SARS-CoV-2.,2020-08-13,"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic in Northern Italy has slowed down the clinical surgical activity. A system of hub and spoke hospitals was set up to take care of oncological patients with the consequent almost complete abolition of the elective surgical activity for non-oncological pathologies. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the surgical volumes of 4 different non academic general hospitals in Lombardy belonging to 4 different provinces. The quarter March April May 2019 was compared with the same period of 2020. All different procedures were listed. The cost analysis was performed using the DRG system. Results: In the four hospitals involved the surgical procedures reduced from 1903 to 350 with a drop of the 81.6%. Procedures for cancer from 403 to 161 with a drop of 60.1%. Procedures for benign disease from 1310 to 118 with a drop of the 91%. Emergencies from 190 to 71 with a drop of the 62.6%. State refund for the procedures performed from 6.708.023 to 1.678.154 with a drop of 75%. Conclusions: Elective surgery was dramatically impaired by the Covid-19 pandemic. Above all procedures for non oncological and non urgent patients were particularly affected. In view of a possible second wave of the pandemic, the surgical planning must select patients not only on onco logical criteria but rather on clinical ones. An ad hoc hub and spoke hospitals pathway has to be implemented for benign surgical diseases by whoever is facing the Covid pandemic at its spike.","Mari, Giulio; Giordano, Rosario; Uccelli, Matteo; Cesana, Giovanni; Olmi, Stefano; Ferrari, Giovanni Carlo; Origi, Matteo; Maggioni, Dario; Colletti, Gaia; Costanzi, Andrea",Chirurgia,https://doi.org/10.21614/chirurgia.115.4.469; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32876020/,647

METHODS In this single institution, prospective analysis, we analyzed six patients who had undergone single-site robotic surgery between December 2013 and August 2014. Surgery was performed using the da Vinci Si Surgical System. Patient characteristics and surgical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Single-site robotic surgery was performed successfully in all six cases. The median patient age was 48 years, and the median body mass index was 25.5 kg/m² (range, 22 to 33 kg/m²). The median total operative time was 211 minutes, and the median duration of intracorporeal vaginal cuff suturing was 32 minutes (range, 22 to 47 minutes). The median duration of pelvic lymph node dissection was 31 minutes on one side and 27 minutes on the other side. Patients' postoperative courses were uneventful. The median postoperative hospital stay was 4 days. No postoperative complications occurred. CONCLUSION When used to treat benign gynecologic tumors and early stage gynecologic cancers, the single-site da Vinci robotic surgery is feasible, safe, and produces favorable surgical outcomes.","Yoo, Ha Na; Kim, Tae Joong; Lee, Yoo Young; Choi, Chel Hun; Lee, Jeong Won; Bae, Duk Soo; Kim, Byoung Gie",Journal of gynecologic oncology,https://doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2015.26.1.62; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25609162/,647

As the population of patients recovering from COVID-19 grows, it is paramount to establish an understanding of the healthcare issues surrounding them. COVID-19 is now recognized as a multi-organ disease with a broad spectrum of manifestations. Similarly to post-acute viral syndromes described in survivors of other virulent coronavirus epidemics, there are increasing reports of persistent and prolonged effects after acute COVID-19. Patient advocacy groups, many members of which identify themselves as long haulers, have helped contribute to the recognition of post-acute COVID-19, a syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms and/or delayed or long-term complications beyond 4 weeks from the onset of symptoms. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the current literature on post-acute COVID-19, its pathophysiology and its organ-specific sequelae. Finally, we discuss relevant considerations for the multidisciplinary care of COVID-19 survivors and propose a framework for the identification of those at high risk for post-acute COVID-19 and their coordinated management through dedicated COVID-19 clinics.","Nalbandian, Ani; Sehgal, Kartik; Gupta, Aakriti; Madhavan, Mahesh V; McGroder, Claire; Stevens, Jacob S; Cook, Joshua R; Nordvig, Anna S; Shalev, Daniel; Sehrawat, Tejasav S; Ahluwalia, Neha; Bikdeli, Behnood; Dietz, Donald; Der-Nigoghossian, Caroline; Liyanage-Don, Nadia; Rosner, Gregg F; Bernstein, Elana J; Mohan, Sumit; Beckley, Akinpelumi A; Seres, David S; Choueiri, Toni K; Uriel, Nir; Ausiello, John C; Accili, Domenico; Freedberg, Daniel E; Baldwin, Matthew; Schwartz, Allan; Brodie, Daniel; Garcia, Christine Kim; Elkind, Mitchell S V; Connors, Jean M; Bilezikian, John P; Landry, Donald W; Wan, Elaine Y",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01283-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33753937/,647

98990,Pediatric cough: what the otolaryngologist needs to know.,2011,"BACKGROUND One of the provisions implemented to contain the spread of Covid-19 infections in Italy was the lockdown. Effects of the lockdown on childbirth outcomes and on the well-being of both the mother and the child have not yet been defined. An inadequate diet during pregnancy and a reduced physical activity can predispose women to become overweight or obese and trigger the development of various complications and maternal-fetal adverse outcomes. METHODS This is a retrospective study including all consecutive patients who delivered at University Hospital Maggiore della Carità in Novara, Italy, in April-May 2017 (group 1, n=294), a period prior to the pandemic, and during the same months in 2020 (group 2, n=256) during and immediately after lockdown. Clinical data were extracted from The Report ""Childbirth Assistance Certificate (CedAP) - Birth Event Analysis"". RESULTS Demographic characteristics were similar between the two study groups, except for a decreased number of married couples in group 2 (p-value 0.018) and an increased percentage of patients with clinical checkups at Family Planning facilities in 2020 (p-value 0.04). The number of hospitalizations during pregnancy was 26 (8.9%) vs 10 (3.9%) with a significative reduction during 2020 (p-value 0.004). Regarding obstetric outcomes, we observed a significant increase in induction of labour in 2020 (23.9% vs 35.9%; p-value 0. 002), a reduction of amniorrhexis (11.3% vs 5.5% p-value 0.015), a reduction of supine positions with an increase of vertical and all fours positions in 2020 (49.3% vs 61.9% and 9.5% vs 12.4% respectively, p 0.023), and a reduction of left occipito-anterior presented part (63.2% vs 55.4%) in favor of right occipito-anterior (34.7% vs 41.2%, p-value 0.019). CONCLUSIONS There were no significant differences either for antepartum or intrapartum complications.

The CNHN was prepared via a convenient calcining routine using the bimetallic CuNi-MOFs as a coprecursor. The unique chemical structure of hollow CNHN with high specific surface area and abundant terminal amino groups effectively avoid the aggregation of AuNPs and facilitate the subsequent adsorption of nitrite. The Au/CNHN exhibited high electrocatalytic activity towards nitrite oxidation due to the synergetic catalytic effect of AuNPs and CNHN. Chronoamperometric detection of nitrite at the Au/CNHN/GCE achieved a lower linear calibration range of 0.05 to 1.15 mM, with an LOD of 0.017 μM compared with previous reports. The proposed method obtained satisfactory recoveries for nitrite determination in practical applications, which was verified by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The prepared sensor based on Au/CNHN featured favorable selectivity and stability, which provides a promising approach for real sample analysis.

Stent deployment was complicated by thrombotic occlusion of the basilar artery, which was successfully reopened. The patient recovered completely, and follow-up angiography at 4 months and 1 year showed patent vertebral artery with gradual shrinkage of the aneurysm. CONCLUSIONS This report contributes to the literature on treatment of large ruptured aneurysms localized in stenotic arteries and in areas of the endocranium where a mass of embolic material in the aneurysm (coils) might compromise the circulation in the parent blood vessel or compress vital brain structures.","Borota, Ljubisa; Gál, Gyula; Jonasson, Per; Ridderheim, Per-Åke",Journal of medical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-1947-8-172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886040/,647

One surprisingly effective platform for healthcare professionals (HCPs) to share knowledge and experiences from the front lines has been social media (for example, the ""#medtwitter"" community on Twitter). However, identifying clinically-relevant content in social media without manual labeling is a challenge because of the sheer volume of irrelevant data. We present an unsupervised, iterative approach to mine clinically relevant information from social media data, which begins by heuristically filtering for HCP-authored texts and incorporates topic modeling and concept extraction with MetaMap. This approach identifies granular topics and tweets with high clinical relevance from a set of about 52 million COVID-19-related tweets from January to mid-June 2020. We also show that because the technique does not require manual labeling, it can be used to identify emerging topics on a week-to-week basis. Our method can aid in future public-health emergencies by facilitating knowledge transfer among healthcare workers in a rapidly-changing information environment, and by providing an efficient and unsupervised way of highlighting potential areas for clinical research.","Wu, Julia; Sivaraman, Venkatesh; Kumar, Dheekshita; Banda, Juan M; Sontag, David",Journal of biomedical informatics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34153432/,647

Data were drawn from a population-level study with the Middle Years Development Instrument (MDI) with grade 7 students in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The research was implemented in public school districts between 2014 and 2018. We found that adolescents who participated in extracurricular activities (e.g., sports, arts programs, community programs) were significantly less likely to engage in recreational screen-based activities (e.g., watching programs, browsing the internet, playing computer games) for 2 or more hours after school. Findings from Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling analyses showed that extracurricular participation was associated with higher levels of satisfaction with life and optimism, and lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. In contrast, longer screen time (≥2 h/day) was associated with lower levels of satisfaction with life and optimism, and higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms; shorter screen time (<2 h/day) was associated with favorable mental health and wellbeing. For screen time, the effect was moderated by gender; the association between longer screen time and poorer mental health and wellbeing was significantly more pronounced for girls than boys. For both boys and girls, mental health and wellbeing were most favorable if they participated in extracurricular activities and reported less than 2 h of recreational screen time per day.","Oberle, Eva; Ji, Xuejun Ryan; Kerai, Salima; Guhn, Martin; Schonert-Reichl, Kimberly A; Gadermann, Anne M",Preventive medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069689/,647

METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal procedures from 1991 to 2005 were analyzed from a longitudinal prospectively collected database. All patients referred to the four surgeons involved in this study were offered a minimally invasive approach. Patient characteristics, perioperative variables, and surgeon experience data were analyzed and compared. RESULTS A total of 991 consecutive laparoscopic colorectal procedures were studied. The majority of operations were performed for malignant disease (n=526, 53%), and most frequently consisted of segmental colonic resections (n=718, 72%). A total of 85 patients (8.6%) had an IOC. Patients experiencing an IOC had a significantly higher median body weight (75 versus 68 kg, p=0.0047) and had a higher proportion of previous abdominal surgery (31% versus 20%, p=0.029). Only 39% of patients suffering an IOC required conversion to open surgery. A total of 126 (13%) cases were converted to open surgery. On multivariable analysis, previous abdominal surgery [odds ratio (OR) 3.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-8.35, p=0.0076] was independently associated with having an IOC and a conversion to open within the same procedure. With increasing experience, individual surgeons were found to operate on heavier patients (p=0.025), and on patients who had a higher rate of previous intra-abdominal surgery (p<0.0001). Despite these risk factors, the early and late experience demonstrated no significant difference in terms of IOCs (p=0.54) and conversion to open surgery (p=0.40). CONCLUSIONS The majority of IOCs can be managed laparoscopically. With increasing experience surgeons can perform laparoscopic colorectal surgery on a patient population with a greater proportion of previous abdominal surgery and a higher mean body weight without adversely affecting their rates of intraoperative complications or conversion.","Bouchard, Alexandre; Martel, Guillaume; Sabri, Elham; Schlachta, Christopher M; Poulin, Eric C; Mamazza, Joseph; Boushey, Robin P",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-008-0087-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18649096/,647

Here, two well-preserved specimens of Champsosaurus (CMN 8920 and CMN 8919) are CT scanned to describe their neurosensory structures and infer sensory capability. The anterior portion of the braincase was poorly ossified and thus does not permit visualization of a complete endocast; however, impressions of the olfactory stalks indicate that they were elongate and likely facilitated good olfaction. The posterior portion of the braincase is ossified and morphologically similar to that of other extinct diapsids. The absence of an otic notch and an expansion of the pars inferior of the inner ear suggests Champsosaurus was limited to detecting low frequency sounds. Comparison of the shapes of semicircular canals with lepidosaurs and archosauromorphs demonstrates that the semicircular canals of Champsosaurus are most similar to those of aquatic reptiles, suggesting that Champsosaurus was well adapted for sensing movement in an aquatic environment. This analysis also demonstrates that birds, non-avian archosauromorphs, and lepidosaurs possess significantly different canal morphologies, and represents the first morphometric analysis of semicircular canals across Diapsida.","Dudgeon, Thomas W; Maddin, Hillary C; Evans, David C; Mallon, Jordan C",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63956-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346021/,647

Herein, we report the behavior of carbohydrate-decorated amphiphilic nanoparticles in a plasma environment with regard to the formation and biological consequences of the protein corona. Naked amphiphilic nanoparticles were produced through the self-assembly of azido-PEO900-docosanoate molecules, and the coupling of N-acetylglucosamine via click chemistry enabled the fabrication of the corresponding bioactive glyco-nanostructures. Light scattering measurements, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the Pierce BCA protein assay all confirmed the presence of protein coronas around the self-assembled nanoparticles, regardless of the presence of the sugar residues, although it reduces the amount of adsorbed proteins. The protein coronas were formed mainly by human serum albumin, complement proteins, apolipoproteins, immunoglobulins, and proteins involved in the coagulation cascade (fibrinogen and prothrombin). While the presence of these protein coronas significantly reduced cellular uptake of the amphiphilic assemblies, they also notably reduced the cytotoxic and hemolytic effects that result from the contact of the nanoparticles with living cells. Accordingly, we highlight that protein coronas should not always be treated as artifacts that have to be avoided because they can also provide beneficial effects.","de Castro, Carlos E; Panico, Karine; Stangherlin, Lucas M; Ribeiro, Caroline A S; da Silva, Maria C C; Carneiro-Ramos, Marcela S; Dal-Bó, Alexandre G; Giacomelli, Fernando C",Bioconjugate chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.0c00564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33169610/,647

Homozygosity for haplotype rs3849266*C_rs2274567*A (CA/CA genotype) was associated with susceptibility to AD (OR = 2.94, p = 0.018). Patients presented higher sCR1 levels in plasma than controls (p = 0.038). Furthermore, patients that carry the rs2274567*G allele (p.1208Arg) presented higher sCR1 levels than A/A (p.1208His/His) homozygotes (p = 0.036). This is the first study to validate the association of CR1 polymorphisms with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, as well as to evaluate sCR1 levels in a Latin American population. SNPs present in the regulatory and coding regions of this gene may be playing a key role in the observed association, probably by interfering in Aβ plaques clearance. Inhibition may be due to the increase in local sCR1 levels observed in patients, which may result from polymorphisms leading to larger isoforms of CR1 and/or structural alterations of the protein that makes it less functional, as well as increased vesiculation of the molecules.","Kretzschmar, Gabriela Canalli; Antoniazzi, Angela Adriane Hanel; Oliveira, Luana Caroline; Nisihara, Renato Mitsunori; Petzl-Erler, Maria Luiza; de Souza, Ricardo Lehtonen R; Boldt, Angelica Beate Winter",Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12031-020-01547-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388800/,647
134801,Effect of Heliox on Respiratory Outcomes during Rigid Bronchoscopy in Term Lambs.,2018,"BACKGROUND Diatoms are of great significance to primary productivity in oceans, yet little is known about their biogeographic distribution in oligotrophic rivers. RESULTS With the help of metabarcoding analysis of 279 samples from the Yangtze River, we provided the first integral biogeographic pattern of planktonic and benthic diatoms over a 6030 km continuum along the world's third largest river. Our study revealed spatial dissimilarity of diatoms under varying landforms, including plateau, mountain, foothill, basin, foothill-mountain, and plain regions, from the river source to the estuary. Environmental drivers of diatom communities were interpreted in terms of photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, channel slope and nutrients, and human interference. Typical benthic diatoms, such as Pinnularia, Paralia, and Aulacoseira, experienced considerable reduction in relative abundance downstream of the Three Gorges Dam and the Xiluodu Dam, two of the world's largest dams. CONCLUSIONS Our study revealed that benthic diatoms are of particular significance in characterizing motile guild in riverine environments, which provides insights into diatom biogeography and biogeochemical cycles in large river ecosystems.","Wang, Jiawen; Liu, Qingxiang; Zhao, Xianfu; Borthwick, Alistair G L; Liu, Yuxin; Chen, Qian; Ni, Jinren",Microbiome,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-019-0771-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31806016/,647
135924,Radiofrequency Ablation vs Electrocautery Blinded Randomized Trial: Impact on Clinically Meaningful Outcomes.,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been implicated in the modulation of pain. Under normal conditions, NPY is found in interneurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and in sympathetic postganglionic neurons but is absent from the cell bodies of sensory neurons. Following peripheral nerve injury NPY is dramatically upregulated in the sensory ganglia. How NPY expression is altered in the peripheral nervous system, distal to a site of nerve lesion, remains unknown. To address this question, NPY expression was investigated using immunohistochemistry at the level of the trigeminal ganglion, the mental nerve and in the skin of the lower lip in relation to markers of sensory and sympathetic fibers in a rat model of trigeminal neuropathic pain. RESULTS At 2 and 6 weeks after chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the mental nerve, de novo expression of NPY was seen in the trigeminal ganglia, in axons in the mental nerve, and in fibers in the upper dermis of the skin. In lesioned animals, NPY immunoreactivity was expressed primarily by large diameter mental nerve sensory neurons retrogradely labelled with Fluorogold. Many axons transported this de novo NPY to the periphery as NPY-immunoreactive (IR) fibers were seen in the mental nerve both proximal and distal to the CCI. Some of these NPY-IR axons co-expressed Neurofilament 200 (NF200), a marker for myelinated sensory fibers, and occasionally colocalization was seen in their terminals in the skin. Peptidergic and non-peptidergic C fibers expressing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or binding isolectin B4 (IB4), respectively, never expressed NPY. CCI caused a significant de novo sprouting of sympathetic fibers into the upper dermis of the skin, and most, but not all of these fibers, expressed NPY. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to provide a comprehensive description of changes in NPY expression in the periphery after nerve injury. Novel expression of NPY in the skin comes mostly from sprouted sympathetic fibers. This information is fundamental in order to understand where endogenous NPY is expressed, and how it might be acting to modulate pain in the periphery.","Magnussen, Claire; Hung, Shih-Ping; Ribeiro-da-Silva, Alfredo",Molecular pain,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12990-015-0029-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26012590/,647

A new antibiotic-eluting mesh has been manufactured on pre-existing polypropylene prostheses using an airbrush spraying technology. Among the degradable polymers tested as coating agents and drug reservoirs, poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), which is deposited after heating, provides a homogeneous, regular and smooth shell around the polypropylene filaments of the mesh without dramatically altering the biomechanical properties of the new modified mesh. An anti-infective drug (e.g. ofloxacin) is incorporated into this polymeric coating giving a limited burst effect followed by sustained drug diffusion for several days. An ofloxacin-eluting mesh has demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity in vitro on Escherichia coli adherence, biofilm formation and inhibitory diameter, even with low drug loads. Although further in vivo investigations are required to draw conclusions on the anti-infective effectiveness of the coated mesh, the airbrush coating of ofloxacin-PCL on existing prostheses is already potentially appealing in an effort to decrease post-operative infection.","Guillaume, Olivier; Lavigne, Jean-Philippe; Lefranc, Olivier; Nottelet, Benjamin; Coudane, Jean; Garric, Xavier",Acta biomaterialia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2011.05.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21621016/,647

The COVID-19 pandemic urged us to reorganize many of our daily clinical processes. In this regard, the protection of vulnerable patient populations is of particular importance, since any visit to the outpatient clinic implies the risk of exposure to and infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Nevertheless, patients with a pacemaker, an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) or an implantable cardiac monitor need regular follow-up to assure proper functionality of these devices. Remote monitoring is the ideal solution to meet the requirements of patient protection and device safety during pandemics. Besides, remote monitoring has already proved its value in normal times.

The purification efficiency of each technique was compared by analyzing the composition ratio of the processed compounds. The effects of the purification techniques on the dynamic metabolic activity of adipose tissue were evaluated in vitro using the glucose transfer assay. We found that the cotton pad adsorption technique displayed the greatest ability to remove aqueous and oil fractions, followed by centrifugation and sedimentation techniques (P < 0.01). The in vitro metabolic activity of adipose tissue peaked at 4 hours. The glucose transfer rates in the cotton pad group and the sedimentation group were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the centrifugation group, and the centrifugation method exerted the greatest effect on the metabolic activity of adipose tissue. To sum up, the optimal processing parameters were the following: sedimentation technique, 30 minutes of sedimentation; centrifugation technique, 3 to 5 minutes of centrifugation and centrifugation force of 200 g; and cotton pad adsorption technique, contact area of 5 cm/mL and contact time of 5 minutes. The cotton pad adsorption technique yielded the best purification of the aqueous and oil fractions, followed by the centrifugation technique, whereas the sedimentation technique exhibited the lowest efficiency.

From a medical perspective alone, these originate from a desire for better clinical management and rational use of medications. Diagnosis can be at the individual-level, at close to patient settings in testing a clinical suspicion or at the community-level, perhaps in front of a computer screen, in classification of endemic areas and devising appropriate control interventions. Thus diagnostics for parasitic diseases has a broad remit as parasites are not only tied with their definitive hosts but also in some cases with their vectors/intermediate hosts. Application of current diagnostic tools and decision algorithms in sustaining control programmes, or in elimination settings, can be problematic and even ill-fitting. For example in resource-limited settings, are current diagnostic tools sufficiently robust for operational use at scale or are they confounded by on-the-ground realities; are the diagnostic algorithms underlying public health interventions always understood and well-received within communities which are targeted for control? Within this Special Issue (SI) covering a variety of diseases and diagnostic settings some answers are forthcoming. An important theme, however, throughout the SI is to acknowledge that cross-talk and continuous feedback between development and application of diagnostic tests is crucial if they are to be used effectively and appropriately.","Stothard, J Russell; Adams, Emily",Parasitology,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0031182014001309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25415359/,647

Objective To define hOPV, hMPV and hORUV geographical distribution and circulation patterns. Method An observational, prospective cross-sectional pilot study was carried out. Two-hundred viral strains obtained from pediatric patients were genotyped by endpoint reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results One-hundred and eighty-six positive samples were typed: 84 hOPV, 43 hMPV, two hORUV and 57 co-infection specimens. Geographical distribution was plotted. hMPV, hOPV, and hORUV cumulative incidences were 0.215, 0.42, and 0.01, respectively. Cumulative incidence of hMPV-hORUV and hMPV-hOPV coinfection was 0.015 and 0.23; for hOPV-hMPV-hORUV, 0.035; and for hORUV-hOPV, 0.005.

The effects of COVID-19 on patients presenting to the hospital with surgical complaints remain uncertain. Methods: A single tertiary center retrospective study analysis compared the ED attendance rate and severity of patients with surgical complaints between March 2020 (COVID-19 outbreak) and pre-COVID-19 periods: February 2020 and the same 2 months in 2019 and 2018. Results: Overall, 6,017 patients were included. The mean daily ED visits of patients with nontrauma surgical complaints in the COVID-19 outbreak period declined by 27%-32% (P value <.01) compared with pre-COVID-19 periods. The log number of confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases in Israel in March 2020 was negatively correlated with the number of ED visits (Pearson's r = -0.59, P < .01). The proportion of patients requiring hospitalization increased by up to 8% during the outbreak period (P < .01), and there was a higher proportion of tachycardic patients (20% versus 15.5%, P = .01). The percentage of visits to the ED by men declined by 5% (P < .01). The ED diagnosis distribution significantly changed during COVID-19 (P = .013), with an 84% decrease in the number of patients hospitalized for diverticular disease (P < .05). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 outbreak, the overall number of patients presenting at the ED with surgical complaints decreased significantly, and there was a higher admissions ratio. The extent to which the pandemic affects hospital ED attendance can help health care professionals prepare for future such events.

ART cannot, however, eliminate HIV from an infected individual. The primary barrier to cure HIV infection is the multiple reservoir sites, including adipose tissue, bone marrow, CNS, liver, lung, male and female reproductive system, secondary lymph nodes and gut-associated lymphoid tissue, established one to two weeks after acquisition of HIV. Additional challenges include understanding the mechanism(s) by which HIV is maintained at low or undetectable levels and developing treatments that will eradicate or produce a sustained suppression of virus without ART. To date, the most extensive clinical investigations of cure strategies have been the shock-and-kill approach employing histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) to induce reactivation of latent HIV. Despite evidence for HIV latency reversal, HDACi alone have not decreased the size of the latent reservoir. Clinical pharmacologic explanations for these results include a low inhibitory quotient (i.e., low potency) within the reservoir sites and intrinsic (e.g., sex differences, reservoir size) and extrinsic (physiochemical and pharmacokinetic drug characteristics) factors. We offer an outline of desired clinical pharmacologic attributes for therapeutics intended for clinical HIV cure research and call for research teams to have early and ongoing involvement of clinical pharmacologists.

Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership.,2000,"The unexpected blast of the COVID has been found everywhere in the world, and everyone has been shocked unusually. In this critical situation, the number of online activities increases, whether related to online education, research, business meetings, virtual conferences, or virtual court. Under this pandemic situation, digital images are the only source of information that can be generally shared and visualized in virtual conferences and social media, and it's challenging to share the document for forgery detection. Today, it's straight forward to forge these images using image-editing software, and it's essential to detect image forgery for such images. In this paper, an efficient novel Discrete-Time Cosine Wavelet and Spatial (DTCWS) Markov feature-based algorithm has been designed for the detection of such forgery, especially for this pandemic situation. For this work, high-dimensional Markov features have been extracted in the DTCWS domain, and the dimensionality of these Markov features has been reduced with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Furthermore, the co-occurrence matrix has increased the correlation among coefficients. For classification, an optimized ensemble classifier is used for evaluating the results instead of using a support vector machine classifier. Due to the time constraint in online activities, the proposed algorithm shows the best accuracy of 99.9% without taking too much time and fewer complexes compared to the current work.","Mehta, Rachna Aggarwal Karan Koundal Deepika Alhudhaif Adi Polat Kemal",Expert Systems with Applications,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115630,647
199068,Early Data From Case Series of Tracheostomy in Patients With SARS-CoV-2,2020,"OBJECTIVE The wide-ranging manipulations to the cardiovascular system that frequently occur during cardiac surgery can expose the brain to variations in its blood supply that could prove deleterious. As a first step to developing a resource suitable for monitoring such changes, we detected the hemodynamic events induced in the brain of a primate model, using high-density near-infrared spectroscopy combined with tomographic reconstruction methods and validated the findings using established radiologic and histologic techniques. METHODS Continuous monitoring of the relative changes in the components of the cerebral hemoglobin signal was performed using high-density near-infrared spectroscopy (270 source-detector channel array) in anesthetized bonnet macaques with the brain exposed to induced ischemia and other acute events. A comparative analysis (exact binomial test) applied to reconstructed 3-dimensional images before and after the events and between cerebral hemispheres, combined with postprocedure magnetic resonance imaging, and postmortem histopathologic examination of the macaques' brains was performed to document and validate the spatial features revealed by the optical findings. RESULTS Relative changes in the measured and calculated components of the hemoglobin signal, in response to the performed manipulations, revealed substantial concurrence among the reconstructed 3-dimensional images, magnetic resonance imaging of the macaques' brains, and postmortem histopathologic examination findings. Concurrence was seen when the manipulated hemoglobin concentration and associated oxygenation levels were either increased or decreased, and whether they were bilateral or restricted to a specified hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS Continuous near-infrared spectroscopy tomography has been shown to accurately capture and localize cerebral ischemia, vasodilatation, and hemorrhage in primates in real time. These findings are directly applicable to clinical intraoperative functional cerebral monitoring.","Lee, Daniel C; Gevorgyan, Tigran; Graber, Harry L; Pfeil, Douglas S; Xu, Yong; Mangla, Sundeep; Barone, Frank C; Libien, Jenny; Charchaflieh, Jean; Kral, John G; Ramirez, Sergio A; Simpson, LeRone; Barbour, Randall L",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25439529/,647
200278,Incorrect Reporting of Statistical Tests,2020,"B cells from nonimmune mice mediate the cytolysis of fibroblasts infected with the coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), strain A59. In this investigation, we report that splenic B cells and a B cell hybridoma induced the fragmentation of MHV-infected target cell DNA into a nucleosomal ladder pattern, characteristic of apoptosis. To determine the mechanism by which B cells mediated this killing event, we used criteria previously established for the killing of target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and compared this B-cell-mediated killing to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-specific CTL killing of LCMV-infected target cells. Unlike CTL-mediated cytotoxicity, B cells efficiently lysed and induced the fragmentation of the DNA in their target cells in the presence of EGTA, arguing against a Ca(2+)-dependent granule exocytosis model for killing. In addition, paraformaldehyde-fixed B cells were able to kill MHV-infected targets. We were unable to detect TNF-alpha-associated cytotoxicity via bioassay with nonimmune effector B cells against the TNF-sensitive cell line, LM, or the TNF-alpha-resistant subline, L929.w, infected with MHV. Serine esterase inhibitors (benzamidine hydrochloride and N alpha-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester) blocked CTL-induced 51Cr release and DNA fragmentation. In contrast, the inhibitors did not block the B-cell-induced 51Cr release, but did cause an inhibition in the fragmentation of the DNA of the target cell. These data indicate that B cells are capable of inducing the lysis and DNA fragmentation of MHV-infected target cells similar to CTL-induced apoptosis. However, we show that the mechanism(s) by which these processes are induced by B cells is distinct from CTL-mediated cytotoxicity.","Nishioka, W K; Welsh, R M",Natural immunity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8392406/,647

METHODS Cohort study of medical charts of patients older than 12 years admitted to 11 intensive care units in 6 cities in the state of Parana, Brazil, during a period of 45 days, with diagnosis of swine influenza. The diagnosis of infection with A (H1N1) was made by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal secretion, or strong clinical suspicion when other causes had been ruled out (even with negative RT-PCR). Descriptive statistics were performed, analysis by the Chi square test was used to compare percentages and the Student's t test for continuous variables with univariate analysis, assuming a significance level of p <0.05. RESULTS There were 63 adult patients admitted with a diagnosis of H1N1, 37 (58.7%) being RT-PCR positive. Most patients were young adults (65% under 40 years of age) with no gender predominance and high incidence of obesity (27.0% with Body Mass Index > 30). Mean of the Acute Physiologic Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score was 15.0 + 8.1. Mortality in the intensive care unit was 39.7%. The main factors associated with mortality were: positive RT-PCR, low levels of initial PaO2/FiO2, high initial levels of urea and lactate dehydrogenase, required level of positive end expiratory pressure, need for the prone position and vasopressors. CONCLUSIONS Adult patients with A (H1N1) virus infection admitted to intensive care units had a high risk of death, particularly due to respiratory impairment. Positive RT-PCR, urea and lactic dehydrogenase, low initial PaO2/FiO2 and high levels of PEEP were correlated with higher mortality.","Duarte, Péricles Almeida Delfino; Venazzi, Alisson; Youssef, Nazah Cherif Mohamad; Oliveira, Mirella Cristine de; Tannous, Luana Alves; Duarte, César Barros; Grion, Cíntia Magalhães Carvalho; Germano, Almir; Schiavetto, Paulo Marcelo; Lins, Alexandre Luiz de Gonzaga Pinho; Campos, Marcos Menezes Freitas; Miúra, Cecília Keiko; Bredt, Carla Sakuma de Oliveira; Toso, Luiz Carlos; Réa-Neto, Alvaro",Revista Brasileira de terapia intensiva,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25303543/,647

The underlying mechanisms are multiple: alteration of the respiratory performance, presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension or obstructive sleep apnea, finally inadequate and excessive immunological responses, possibly aggravated by ectopic intrathoracic fat depots. Thus, COVID-19 may challenge the so-called « obesity paradox » commonly reported by intensivists in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. These findings require reinforced preventive and curative measures among obese patients to limit the risk of progression towards an unfavorable outcome in case of COVID-19.","Scheen, André J",Revue medicale suisse,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32462841/,647

A common issue in all of these crises seems to be the issue of ""trust."" Official authorities, including the Iranian President, ministers, and the judiciary system, tried to gain people's trust by either changing policies or developing new ones. In August 2019, the new law on crisis management in Iran went into effect and the issue of public donation has been considered, too. Also, in their response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Iranian officials ordered all sectors to cooperate with the Ministry of Health and provide it with all necessary facilities. Therefore, it seems that new policies are still needed to overcome mistrust in Iran at times of emergency. Developing a policy on donation management was the first step, and there are several factors that could have contributed to the perception of the mistrust and failure in emergency missions. Mistrust can be the result of different causes, including but not limited to lack of knowledge on capabilities and efficiencies of humanitarian organizations, engagement of a wide range of organizations from different categories, extension of mistrust of an organization to other emergency organizations in the area or all of operation, lack of unity in emergency response, and poor public relations.","Seddighi, Hamed",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,647

As SARS-CoV-2 initially infects the upper respiratory tract, its first interactions with the immune system must occur predominantly at the respiratory mucosal surfaces, during both inductive and effector phases of the response. However, almost all studies of the immune response in COVID-19 have focused exclusively on serum antibodies and systemic cell-mediated immunity including innate responses. This article proposes that there is a significant role for mucosal immunity and for secretory as well as circulating IgA antibodies in COVID-19, and that it is important to elucidate this in order to comprehend especially the asymptomatic and mild states of the infection, which appear to account for the majority of cases. Moreover, it is possible that mucosal immunity can be exploited for beneficial diagnostic, therapeutic, or prophylactic purposes.","Russell, Michael W; Moldoveanu, Zina; Ogra, Pearay L; Mestecky, Jiri",Front Immunol,,647

Objective: To describe the presentation of acute myocardial inflammation in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who recovered from the influenzalike syndrome and developed fatigue and signs and symptoms of heart failure a week after upper respiratory tract symptoms. Design, Setting, and Participant: This case report describes an otherwise healthy 53-year-old woman who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the cardiac care unit in March 2020 for acute myopericarditis with systolic dysfunction, confirmed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the week after onset of fever and dry cough due to COVID-19. The patient did not show any respiratory involvement during the clinical course. Exposure: Cardiac involvement with COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Detection of cardiac involvement with an increase in levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin T, echocardiography changes, and diffuse biventricular myocardial edema and late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Results: An otherwise healthy 53-year-old white woman presented to the emergency department with severe fatigue. She described fever and dry cough the week before. She was afebrile but hypotensive; electrocardiography showed diffuse ST elevation, and elevated high-sensitivity troponin T and NT-proBNP levels were detected. Findings on chest radiography were normal. There was no evidence of obstructive coronary disease on coronary angiography. Based on the COVID-19 outbreak, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed, with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed increased wall thickness with diffuse biventricular hypokinesis, especially in the apical segments, and severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%). Short tau inversion recovery and T2-mapping sequences showed marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema, and there was also diffuse late gadolinium enhancement involving the entire biventricular wall. There was a circumferential pericardial effusion that was most notable around the right cardiac chambers. These findings were all consistent with acute myopericarditis. She was treated with dobutamine, antiviral drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir), steroids, chloroquine, and medical treatment for heart failure, with progressive clinical and instrumental stabilization. Conclusions and Relevance: This case highlights cardiac involvement as a complication associated with COVID-19, even without symptoms and signs of interstitial pneumonia.","Inciardi, Riccardo M; Lupi, Laura; Zaccone, Gregorio; Italia, Leonardo; Raffo, Michela; Tomasoni, Daniela; Cani, Dario S; Cerini, Manuel; Farina, Davide; Gavazzi, Emanuele; Maroldi, Roberto; Adamo, Marianna; Ammirati, Enrico; Sinagra, Gianfranco; Lombardi, Carlo M; Metra, Marco",JAMA Cardiol,,647

320364,Comparison of 2 Triage Scoring Guidelines for Allocation of Mechanical Ventilators,2020,"Abrupt changes in food preferences and eating habits have induced an overlooked health risk during the coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19). Indeed, emerging evidence points to a major shift to consumption of high-sodium foods during the pandemic lockdowns in the population from different countries and cultures. High-sodium foods have sodium contents exceeding 500 mg per 100 g, and many processed and preserved foods fall into this category. Excessive dietary sodium intake is associated with chronic diseases including hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and kidney diseases, and thus poses confounding risks during the pandemic. Here, we review food categories in consumers' shopping lists and food parcels delivered to people who needed assistance during the pandemic, when frozen meals, canned foods, instant foods, snacks, and other high-sodium foods gained substantial popularity. Such change in consumers' behavior is driven by several factors: the perceived risk of viral infection in grocery shopping trips, limited supplies and inflated prices of fresh produce, preference on foods with long shelf lives, and emotional eating. Moreover, the general low awareness of sodium contents in food has contributed to the increased consumption of high-sodium foods during the pandemic. We also discuss the possible effects on COVID-19 infection and severity caused by excessive sodium intake. We conclude that the public should be educated to maintain a healthy sodium intake during the pandemic, and measures should be adopted by governments and private donors in procuring food parcels with more balanced sodium contents to lower the risks of prolonged and excessive sodium intakes in the vulnerable population.","Zhang, Xue; Chen, Bo; Jia, Puqi; Han, Jie",Environ Chem Lett,,647

322177,Regarding Use of Topical Steroids in Patients With COVID-19-Associated Olfactory Loss-Reply,2020,"KEY POINTS: Exercising at different times of day elicits different effects on exercise performance and metabolic health. However, the specific signals driving the observed time-of-day specific effects of exercise have not been fully identified. Exercise influences the skeletal muscle circadian clock, although the relative contribution of muscle contraction and extracellular signals is unknown. Here, we show that contraction acutely increases the expression of the core circadian clock gene Period Circadian Regulator 2 (Per2) and phase-shifts Per2 rhythmicity in muscle cells. This contraction effect on core clock genes is mediated through a calcium-dependant mechanism; The results obtained in the present study suggest that a proportion of the ability of exercise to entrain the skeletal muscle clock is driven directly by muscle contraction. Contraction interventions may be used to mimic some time-of-day specific effects of exercise on metabolism and muscle performance. ABSTRACT: Exercise entrains the central and peripheral circadian clocks, although the mechanism by which exercise modulates expression of skeletal muscle clock genes is unclear. The present study aimed to determine whether skeletal muscle contraction alone could directly influence circadian rhythmicity and uncover the underlying mechanism by which contraction modulates clock gene expression. We investigated the expression of core clock genes in human skeletal muscle after acute exercise, as well as following in vitro contraction in mouse soleus muscle and cultured C2C12 skeletal muscle myotubes. Additionally, we interrogated the molecular pathways by which skeletal muscle contraction could influence clock gene expression. Contraction acutely increased the expression of the core circadian clock gene Period Circadian Regulator 2 (Per2) and phase-shifted Per2 rhythmicity in C2C12 myotubes in vitro. Further investigation revealed that pharmacologically increasing cytosolic calcium concentrations by ionomycin treatment mimicked the effect of contraction on Per2 expression. Similarly, treatment with a calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, blocked the effect of electric pulse stimulation-induced contraction on Per2 expression. Increased calcium influx from contraction lead to binding of the phosphorylated form of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) to the Per2 promoter, suggesting a role of CREB in contraction-induced Per2 transcription. Thus, by dissociating the effect of muscle contraction alone from the whole effect of exercise, our investigations indicate that a proportion of the ability of exercise to entrain the skeletal muscle clock is driven directly by contraction.","Small, Lewin; Altintas, Ali; Laker, Rhianna C; Ehrlich, Amy; Pattamaprapanont, Pattarawan; Villarroel, Julia; Pillon, Nicolas J; Zierath, Juleen R; Barrès, Romain",J. physiol,,647

We use a novel dataset that we collected to monitor the three countries during the crisis. As outcome variables, we used expectations (e.g., economic outlook, labour market situation, recovery), fear (e.g., scenario of new outburst, economic depression, restriction to individual rights and freedom), and behavioural change across the following dimensions: savings, cultural consumption, social capital, and risky behaviour. We provide descriptive evidence that is representative of the population of interest, and we estimate the impact of exposure to shock occurred during the crisis on the same outcome variables, using matching techniques. Our main findings are the following: we detected systematically negative expectations regarding the future and the recovery, majoritarian fears of an economic depression, a new outbreak, and a permanent restriction on freedom, a reduction in saving and in social capital. Exposure to shocks decreased expected job prospects, increased withdrawal from accumulated savings, and reduced contacts with the network relevant to job advancement, whereas it had inconclusive effects over fears.

In this review we summarize the last years findings of our intense screenings and characterization of the six CaV2.2 interaction partners, tetraspanin-13 (TSPAN-13), reticulon 1 (RTN1), member 1 of solute carrier family 38 (SLC38), prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS), transmembrane protein 223 (TMEM223) and transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif 3 (Grina/TMBIM3) containing protein. Each protein shows a unique way of channel modulation as shown by extensive electrophysiological studies. Amongst the newly identified interactors, Grina/TMBIM3 is most striking due to its modulatory effect which is rather comparable to G-protein regulation.","Lacinova, Lubica; Mallmann, Robert Theodor; Jurkovicová-Tarabová, Bohumila; Klugbauer, Norbert",,,647

To determine the impacts of adjuvant corticosteroid administrated to patients with non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHOD: A retrospective cohort study based on propensity score analysis was designed to explore the effects of corticosteroid on several clinical outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two patients satisfied the inclusion criteria and 35 pairs were generated according to propensity score matching. Compared to non-corticosteroid group, the CT score on day 7 was significantly higher in corticosteroid group (8.6 (interquartile range [IQR], 2.8-11.5) versus 12.0 (IQR, 5.0-19.3), Pâ=â0.046). In corticosteroid group, more patients progressed to severe cases (11.4% versus 2.9%, Pâ=â0.353), hospital stay (23.5 days (IQR, 19-29 d) versus 20.2 days (IQR, 14-25.3 d), Pâ=â0.079) and duration of viral shedding (20.3 days (IQR, 15.2-24.8 d) versus 19.4 days (IQR, 11.5-28.3 d), Pâ=â0.669) were prolonged, while fever time (9.5 days (IQR, 6.5-12.2 d) versus 10.2 days (IQR, 6.8-14 d), Pâ=â0.28) was shortened; however, all these data revealed no statistically significant differences. CONCLUSION: Corticosteroid might have a negative effect on lung injury recovery in non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients; however, the results of this study must be interpreted with caution because of confounding factors.","Yuan, Mingli; Xu, Xiaoxiao; Xia, Dongping; Tao, Zhaowu; Yin, Wen; Tan, Weijun; Hu, Yi; Song, Cheng",Shock,,647
371524,Surgery after SARS-CoV-2 infection: Wait 7 weeks!!!,2021,"BACKGROUND: Millions of people have been infected worldwide in the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we aim to propose fourteen prediction models based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the COVID-19 outbreak for policy makers. METHODS: The ANN-based models were utilized to estimate the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, Japan, Singapore, Iran, Italy, South Africa and United States of America. These models exploit historical records of confirmed cases, while their main difference is the number of days that they assume to have impact on the estimation process. The COVID-19 data were divided into a train part and a test part. The former was used to train the ANN models, while the latter was utilized to compare the purposes. The data analysis shows not only significant fluctuations in the daily confirmed cases but also different ranges of total confirmed cases observed in the time interval considered. RESULTS: Based on the obtained results, the ANN-based model that takes into account the previous 14 days outperforms the other ones. This comparison reveals the importance of considering the maximum incubation period in predicting the COVID-19 outbreak. Comparing the ranges of determination coefficients indicates that the estimated results for Italy are the best one. Moreover, the predicted results for Iran achieved the ranges of [0.09, 0.15] and [0.21, 0.36] for the mean absolute relative errors and normalized root mean square errors, respectively, which were the best ranges obtained for these criteria among different countries. CONCLUSION: Based on the achieved results, the ANN-based model that takes into account the previous fourteen days for prediction is suggested to predict daily confirmed cases, particularly in countries that have experienced the first peak of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study has not only proved the applicability of ANN-based model for prediction of the COVID-19 outbreak, but also showed that considering incubation period of SARS-COV-2 in prediction models may generate more accurate estimations.","Niazkar, Hamid Reza; Niazkar, Majid",Glob Health Res Policy,,647

While severe insulin resistance is most frequently seen in the setting of medication side effects or rare genetic conditions, this report of two cases highlights the presence of severe insulin resistance in the setting of severe COVID-19 and explores how this may contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with diabetes who become infected with SARS-CoV-2. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present the cases of two African-American women with pre-existing type 2 diabetes who developed severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation and concurrent severe insulin resistance with total daily insulin dose requirements of greater than 5 unit/kg. Both patients received aggressive insulin infusion and subcutaneous insulin therapy to obtain adequate glucose management. As their COVID-19 clinical course improved, their severe insulin resistance improved as well. CONCLUSIONS: The association between critical illness and hyperglycemia is well documented in the literature, however severe insulin resistance is not commonly identified and may represent a unique clinical feature of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection and type 2 diabetes.","Affinati, A.

The EV71 is a major causative disease for hand, foot, and mouth disease; sometimes it is associated with severe central nervous system diseases. Treatment for enteroviral infection is mainly supportive; treatment for aseptic meningitis caused by enteroviruses is also generally symptomatic. Upon the urgent request of new anti-enterovirus drugs, a series of hinged aromatic compounds with polynulei were synthesized through two different chemical pathways. Among these morpholine-furan/thiophene/pyrrole-benzene-pyrazole conjugates, three new agents exhibited inhibitory activity with EC50 = 2.29-6.16 µM toward EV71 strain BrCr in RD cells. Their selectivity index values were reached as high as 33.4. Their structure-activity relationship was deduced that a thiophene derivative with morpholine and trifluorobenzene rings showed the greatest antiviral activity, with EC50 = 2.29 µM.","Hwu, Jih Ru; Panja, Avijit; Jayakumar, Srinivasan; Tsay, Shwu-Chen; Tan, Kui-Thong; Huang, Wen-Chieh; Hu, Yu-Chen; Leyssen, Pieter; Neyts, Johan",Molecules (Basel),,647

Para tal, utiliza-se dados da Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde de 2013. Para caracterizar os grupos de risco, ajustou-se um modelo de regressão logística binária múltipla tendo como variável a resposta à existência ou não de pelo menos uma condição associada à COVID-19 e como variáveis explicativas a idade, sexo, grande região, cor ou raça, nível de escolaridade e condição em relação à força de trabalho dos moradores entrevistados pela pesquisa. Os resultados mostram que a idade é o principal fator de risco para comorbidades associadas à COVID-19, mas há também maior risco para pessoas em categorias mais vulneráveis, como os menos escolarizados e pretos e pardos. Estima-se que 68,7% dos brasileiros viviam com pelo menos uma pessoa no grupo de risco - 30,3% viviam com pelo menos um idoso e outros 38,4% não tinham idosos em seus domicílios, mas havia pelo menos um morador adulto com condições médicas preexistentes. A proporção de pessoas vivendo em domicílios com pelo menos um morador no grupo de risco era maior ou igual a 50% para todas as idades, sendo crescente a partir dos 35 anos, mas havia também um alto número de pessoas com idades entre 10 e 25 anos convivendo com pessoas no grupo de risco. Tais resultados sugerem que, em função das dificuldades em se evitar contato próximo intradomiciliar, o isolamento exclusivo de grupos populacionais específicos não se configura uma estratégia possível no contexto brasileiro, devendo ser combinado com o isolamento do conjunto da população.","Borges, Gabriel Mendes; Crespo, Claudio Dutra",Cad.

METHODS: We designed a discrete-choice experiment to administer 10 choice questions to each respondent representing experimentally controlled pairs of scenarios defined by when nonessential businesses could reopen (May, July, or October 2020), cumulative percentage of Americans contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through 2020 (2% to 20%), time for economic recovery (2 to 5 years), and the percentage of US households falling below the poverty threshold (16% to 25%). Respondents were recruited by SurveyHealthcareGlobus. RESULTS: A total of 5953 adults across all 50 states completed the survey between May 8 and 20, 2020. Latent-class analysis supported a 4-class model. The largest class (36%) represented COVID-19 risk-minimizers, reluctant to accept any increases in COVID-19 risks. About 26% were waiters, strongly preferring to delay reopening nonessential businesses, independent of COVID-19 risk levels. Another 25% represented recovery-supporters, primarily concerned about time required for economic recovery. This group would accept COVID-19 risks as high as 16% (95% CI: 13%-19%) to shorten economic recovery from 3 to 2 years. The final openers class prioritized lifting social distancing restrictions, accepting of COVID-19 risks greater than 20% to open in May rather than July or October. Political affiliation, race, household income, and employment status were all associated with class membership (P<.01). CONCLUSION: Americans have diverse preferences pertaining to social-distancing restrictions, infection risks, and economic outcomes. These findings can assist elected and public-health officials in making difficult policy decisions related to the pandemic.","Reed, Shelby; Gonzalez, Juan Marcos; Johnson, F Reed",Value Health,,647

Preliminary samples were collected from a hospital and a local municipal wastewater treatment plant. Molecular diagnostic methods were compared side-by-side to assess feasibility, performance and sensitivity. Refined sample collection and processing protocols were then used to monitor two occupied dormitory complexes (n = 105 and 66) over eight weeks. Wastewater results were validated using known case counts from external clinical testing of building occupants. Results confirm that ultracentrifugation from a 24 hour composite collection had a sensitivity of 96.2% and a specificity of 100%. However, the method could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. If the detection of convalescent shedding is considered a false positive, then the sensitivity is 100% and specificity drops to 45%. It was determined that the proposed approach constitutes a highly sensitive wastewater surveillance method for detecting SARS-CoV-2, but it could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding. Future work must focus on approaches to distinguish new infections from convalescent shedding to fully realize the potential of building wastewater as a surveillance tool for congregate living.ImportanceSome of the most severe outbreaks of COVID-19 have taken place in places where persons live together, such as a nursing homes. Wastewater testing from individual buildings could be used for frequent pooled surveillance of virus from all occupants, including those who are contagious with or without symptoms. This work provides a sensitive practical method for detecting infected individuals, as validated in two building complexes housing occupants who underwent frequent clinical testing performed by external entities. Although this sensitive method could be deployed now for pooled surveillance as an early warning system to limit outbreaks, the study shows that the approach will require further refinement to differentiate between contagious newly infected individuals from persons who have persistent viral fragments shedding in their stool outside the contagious period.","Colosi, Lisa M; Barry, Katie E; Kotay, Shireen M; Porter, Michael D; Poulter, Melinda D; Ratliff, Cameron; Simmons, William; Steinberg, Limor I; Wilson, D Derek; Morse, Rena; Zmick, Paul; Mathers, Amy J",,,647

As an important part of public services, rail transit requires effective response countermeasures to control the spread of COVID-19. Considering the current development of the epidemic situation, this article discusses the characteristics of COVID-19 transmission and identifies vulnerable areas to target in order to prevent and control the spread of the epidemic in the rail transit system. Countermeasures adopted to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are analyzed in terms of external and internal categories, which were classified into six groups: passenger service, case care, information, staff, equipment and operation management. An evaluation architecture was also constructed, which was established from the perspective of effectiveness, economic efficiency, acceptability, privacy and so on. The effect of implementing the measures was evaluated by a social survey, and their advantages and shortcomings were analyzed, which can be used to guide future epidemic prevention and control for rail transit systems around the world. It is important to formulate a reasonable work schedule according to local conditions, providing a reference for rapid response to future public health emergencies of international concern.","Yin, Yonghao; Li, Dewei; Zhang, Songliang; Wu, Lifu",Urban Rail Transit,,647

However, often ignored complexities have generated confusion around use of the metric. This is particularly apparent with the emergent pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We address some misconceptions about the predictive ability of the reproductive number, focusing on how it changes over time, varies over space, and relates to epidemic size by referencing the mathematical definition of R and examples from the current pandemic. We hope that a better appreciation of the uses, nuances, and limitations of R and R0 facilitates a better understanding of epidemic spread, epidemic severity, and the effects of interventions in the context of SARS-CoV-2.","Shaw, Clara L; Kennedy, David A",Theor Popul Biol,,647

About 700 teachers from the four countries participated in this study. They were given an online questionnaire that involved 22 open-ended items, in which they were requested to complete the items that were structured taking into account the relationships between teacher, students, mathematics and resources. The qualitative analysis of teachers' answers was carried out, referring to both the meta-didactical transposition model and Bishop's framework on values to investigate teachers' teaching-learning activities and the reasons underlying their choices. The empirical analysis suggests four tasks corresponding to the main challenges that teachers had to face during the time of lockdown: (a) managing distance learning to support students' learning through specific methodologies;(b) managing distance learning to develop assessment;(c) managing distance learning to support those students that face difficulties and/or are living a difficult situation/developing inclusive teaching;and (d) managing distance learning to exploit its potentialities for fostering typical mathematical processes. The values that motivated the teachers to change their teaching-learning activities are discussed, conclusions of how the time of lockdown affects the mathematics teaching is drawn, and finally, recommendations and insights from this study are shared.","Aldon, Gilles Cusi Annalisa Schacht Florian Swidan Osama",Education Sciences,,647

METHODS: This study emulates a (hypothetical) target trial using observational data from a cohort of United States Veterans admitted to a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility between May 1 and November 17, 2020 with non-severe COVID-19. The intervention was convalescent plasma initiated within 2 days of eligibility. Thirty-day mortality was compared using cumulative incidence curves, risk differences, and hazard ratios estimated from pooled logistic models with inverse probability weighting to adjust for confounding. RESULTS: Of 11,269 eligible person-trials contributed by 4,755 patients, 402 trials were assigned to the convalescent plasma group. Forty and 671 deaths occurred within the plasma and non-plasma groups, respectively. The estimated 30-day mortality risk was 6.5% (95% CI: 4.0, 9.7) in the plasma group and 6.2% (95% CI: 5.6, 7.0) in the non-plasma group. The associated risk difference was 0.30% (95% CI -2.30, 3.60) and the hazard ratio was 1.04 (95% CI 0.64,1.62).

Improved methods to predict host specificity of coronaviruses will be valuable for identifying and controlling future outbreaks. The coronavirus S protein plays a key role in host specificity by attaching the virus to receptors on the cell membrane. We analyzed 1238 spike sequences for their host specificity. Spike sequences readily segregate in t-SNE embeddings into clusters of similar hosts and/or virus species. Machine learning with SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest gave high average accuracies, [Formula: see text] scores, sensitivities and specificities of 0.95–0.99.

Laboratory research using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models has been accelerated to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, such experimental research involving SARS-CoV-2 is restricted to biocontainment/safety level-3 (BSL-3) settings, due to the high pathogenicity of this virus. Since many of the downstream analyses of SARS-CoV-2-infected biological samples need to be conducted in a non-BSL3 setting, it is important to ensure that the samples are fully decontaminated and safe for subsequent analysis. Here, we report the effectiveness of standard procedures used to fix cells and tissues for pathological analysis, including 2% or 4% paraformaldehyde, 50%–70% ethanol, 10% neutral buffered formalin and ultrafiltration using membranes with a molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) ranging from 3 to 30 kDa, for inactivating or eliminating SARS-CoV-2. We validated these methods in experimental laboratory samples, such as viral inoculum in cell culture media, SARS-CoV-2 infected host cells and animal tissue lysates. We found that 15 minutes’ treatment of viral inoculum (10(5) plaque-forming units; PFU) or SARS-CoV-2 infected cells with paraformaldehyde or 70% ethanol resulted in complete inactivation of the virus. The treatment of infected hamster lung tissues with 10% neutral buffered formalin also fully inactivated the virus. However, only 3 kDa ultracentrifuge filter was effective in eliminating the virus to an undetectable limit in the filtrate. Our validated methods are useful for decontaminating biological samples to reduce infection risk and safe handling in BSL2 facilities.","Kumar, Ranjeet; Kolloli, Afsal; Subbian, Selvakumar",Methods Protoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33673589/; https://doi.org/10.3390/mps4010018,647

Schools provide an ideal setting for physical activity interventions to help children move more. Instead of targeting in-service teachers, this study embedded an evidence-based active pedagogy program called Transform-Ed! into pre-service teacher education. Pre/post surveys and post-program interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with key stakeholders (n = 5), lecturers (n = 6), and pre-service teachers (n = 274) involved with the 12-week program. The design, implementation, and evaluation of the study were systematically guided by all five dimensions of Glasgow and colleagues’ RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. Linear mixed models, descriptive analysis and a framework approach were used to analyse the data. Significant improvements were observed in pre-service teachers’ willingness, confidence, and competence to implement physically active pedagogic strategies following the intervention. Pre-service teacher perceived effectiveness of such strategies on student outcomes also significantly increased and perceived barriers decreased. High adherence was consistently reported and the program was maintained after completion of the implementation trial by all lecturers. Four key themes spanning multiple dimensions and participant levels informed recommendations for program scalability: an “inter-systemic approach”, a “co-design” approach, “embedded in professional practice”, and “evidence of impact” on teacher practice. Anchored in real-world settings and tethered by implementation science, Transform-Ed! could have the potential to advance the teaching capability of teachers, and transform the learning experience and physical and academic outcomes of primary school students.","Lander, Natalie; Mazzoli, Emiliano; Cassar, Samuel; Symington, Naomi; Salmon, Jo",Children (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33147706/; https://doi.org/10.3390/children7110207,647

COVID-19 amplified those concerns, and an examination of recommendations to manage COVID-19 may shed light on the future of AL. This review summarizes recommendations from six key organizations related to preparation for and response to COVID-19 in assisted living (AL) in relation to resident health and quality of life; compares recommendations for AL with those for nursing homes (NH); and assesses implications for the future of AL. Design Nonsystematic review involving search of gray literature. Setting and Participants Recommendations from key governmental bodies and professional societies regarding COVID-19 in AL, long-term care facilities (LTCF) in general, and NHs. Measures We collected, categorized, and summarized these recommendations as they pertained to quality of life and health care. Results Many recommendations for AL and NHs were similar, but differences provided insight into ways the pandemic has recognized and challenged AL communities in particular: recommending more flexible visitation and group activities for AL, providing screening by AL staff or an outside provider, and suggesting that AL staff should access resources to facilitate advance care planning discussions. Recommendations were that AL integrate health care into offered services, including working with consulting clinicians who know both resident and LTC community. Conclusions and Implications Long-term care providers and policy makers have recognized the need to modify current long-term care options. Because COVID-19 recommendations suggest AL communities would benefit from the services and expertise of social workers, licensed nurses, and physicians, it may accelerate the integration and closer coordination of psychosocial and medical care into AL.

Having identified the RNA extraction step as one of the key bottlenecks, we tested several alternatives that avoid the use of commercial kits for this step. The analysis showed that 2-propanol precipitation of the viral RNA, followed by one-step RT-qPCR results in a sensitivity and specificity comparable to that provided currently by automatized systems such as the COBAS 6800 system. Therefore, this simple protocol allows SARS-CoV-2 testing independently of commercial kit providers in a time and cost-effective manner. It can be readily implemented in research and/or diagnostic laboratories worldwide, provided that patient confidentiality and researcher safety are ensured.

METHODS: We performed a systematic review to evaluate the effects of COVID‐19 on pregnancy, perinatal and neonatal outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database and Wan Fang Data until 20 April 2020 (studies were identified through PubMed alert after that date). For the research strategy, combinations of the following keywords and MeSH terms were used: SARS‐CoV‐2, COVID‐19, coronavirus disease 2019, pregnancy, gestation, maternal, mothers, vertical transmission, maternal‐fetal transmission, intrauterine transmission, neonates, infant, delivery. Eligibility criteria included laboratory‐confirmed and/or clinically diagnosed COVID‐19, patient being pregnant on admission and availability of clinical characteristics, including at least one maternal, perinatal or neonatal outcome. Exclusion criteria were non‐peer‐reviewed or unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study, suspicion of duplicate reporting, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes. No language restrictions were applied. RESULTS: We identified a high number of relevant case reports and case series, but only 24 studies, including a total of 324 pregnant women with COVID‐19, met the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review. These comprised nine case series (eight consecutive) and 15 case reports. A total of 20 pregnant patients with laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19 were included in the case reports. In the combined data from the eight consecutive case series, including 211 (71.5%) cases of laboratory‐confirmed and 84 (28.5%) of clinically diagnosed COVID‐19, the maternal age ranged from 20 to 44 years and the gestational age on admission ranged from 5 to 41 weeks. The most common symptoms at presentation were fever, cough, dyspnea/shortness of breath, fatigue and myalgia. The rate of severe pneumonia reported amongst the case series ranged from 0 to 14%, with the majority of the cases requiring admission to the intensive care unit. Almost all cases from the case series had positive computer tomography chest findings. All six and 22 cases that had nucleic‐acid testing in vaginal mucus and breast milk samples, respectively, were negative for SARS‐CoV‐2. Only four cases of spontaneous miscarriage or abortion were reported. In the consecutive case series, 219/295 women had delivered at the time of reporting, and the majority of these had Cesarean section. The gestational age at delivery ranged from 28 to 41 weeks. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min ranged from 7 to 10 and 7 to 10, respectively. Only eight neonates had birth weight <2500 g and nearly one‐third of cases were transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. There was one case each of neonatal asphyxia and neonatal death. In 155 neonates that had nucleic‐acid testing in throat swab, all, except three cases, were negative for SARS‐CoV‐2. There were seven maternal deaths, four intrauterine fetal deaths (one with twin pregnancy) and two neonatal deaths (twin pregnancy) reported in a non‐consecutive case series of nine cases with severe COVID‐19. From the case reports, two maternal deaths, one neonatal death and two cases of neonatal SARS‐CoV‐2 infection were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increasing number of published studies on COVID‐19 in pregnancy, there are insufficient good‐quality data to draw unbiased conclusions with regard to the severity of the disease or specific complications of COVID‐19 in pregnant women, as well as vertical transmission, perinatal and neonatal complications. In order to answer specific questions in relation to the impact of COVID‐19 on pregnant women and their fetuses through meaningful good‐quality research, we urge researchers and investigators to present complete outcome data and reference previously published cases in their publications, and to record such reporting when the data of a case are entered into a registry or several registries.

Hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with azithromycin, is being widely used in Covid-19 therapy based on anecdotal and limited observational evidence. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in all United States Veterans Health Administration medical centers until April 11, 2020. Patients were categorized based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone (HC) or with azithromycin (HC+AZ) as treatments in addition to standard supportive management for Covid-19. The two primary outcomes were death and the need for mechanical ventilation. We determined the association between treatment and the primary outcomes using competing risk hazard regression adjusting for clinical characteristics via propensity scores. Discharge and death were taken into account as competing risks and subdistribution hazard ratios are presented. RESULTS: A total of 368 patients were evaluated (HC, n=97; HC+AZ, n=113; no HC, n=158). Rates of death in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 27.8%, 22.1%, 11.4%, respectively. Rates of ventilation in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 13.3%, 6.9%, 14.1%, respectively. Compared to the no HC group, the risk of death from any cause was higher in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.10 to 6.17; P=0.03) but not in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.56 to 2.32; P=0.72). The risk of ventilation was similar in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.53 to 3.79; P=0.48) and in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.16 to 1.12; P=0.09), compared to the no HC group. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone. These findings highlight the importance of awaiting the results of ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread adoption of these drugs.","Magagnoli, Joseph; Narendran, Siddharth; Pereira, Felipe; Cummings, Tammy; Hardin, James W.; Sutton, S.

643265,Receipt of Posthospitalization Care Training Among Medicare Beneficiaries’ Family Caregivers,2021-03-16,"The role of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy (V-V ECMO) in severe COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is still under debate and conclusive data from large cohorts are scarce. Furthermore, criteria for the selection of patients that benefit most from this highly invasive and resource-demanding therapy are yet to be defined. In this study, we assess survival in an international multicenter cohort of COVID-19 patients treated with V-V ECMO and evaluate the performance of several clinical scores to predict 30-day survival. Methods: This is an investigator-initiated retrospective non-interventional international multicenter registry study (NCT04405973, first registered 28 May 2020). In 127 patients treated with V-V ECMO at 15 centers in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, and the United States, we calculated the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) Score, Respiratory Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Survival Prediction (RESP) Score, Predicting Death for Severe ARDS on V-V ECMO (PRESERVE) Score, and 30-day survival. Results: In our study cohort which enrolled 127 patients, overall 30-day survival was 54%. Median SOFA, SAPS II, APACHE II, RESP, and PRESERVE were 9, 36, 17, 1, and 4, respectively. The prognostic accuracy for all these scores (area under the receiver operating characteristic—AUROC) ranged between 0.548 and 0.605. Conclusions: The use of scores for the prediction of mortality cannot be recommended for treatment decisions in severe COVID-19 ARDS undergoing V-V ECMO; nevertheless, scoring results below or above a specific cut-off value may be considered as an additional tool in the evaluation of prognosis. Survival rates in this cohort of COVID-19 patients treated with V-V ECMO were slightly lower than those reported in non-COVID-19 ARDS patients treated with V-V ECMO.","Supady, Alexander; DellaVolpe, Jeff; Taccone, Fabio Silvio; Scharpf, Dominik; Ulmer, Matthias; Lepper, Philipp M.; Halbe, Maximilian; Ziegeler, Stephan; Vogt, Alexander; Ramanan, Raj; Boldt, David; Stecher, Stephanie-Susanne; Montisci, Andrea; Spangenberg, Tobias; Marggraf, Olivier; Kunavarapu, Chandra; Peluso, Lorenzo; Muenz, Sebastian; Buerle, Monica; Nagaraj, Naveen G.; Nuding, Sebastian; Toma, Catalin; Gudzenko, Vadim; Stemmler, Hans Joachim; Pappalardo, Federico; Trummer, Georg; Benk, Christoph; Michels, Guido; Duerschmied, Daniel; von zur Muehlen, Constantin; Bode, Christoph; Kaier, Klaus; Brodie, Daniel; Wengenmayer, Tobias; Staudacher, Dawid L.",Membranes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33673615/; https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes11030170,647
646774,Computational Errors and Incorrect Analysis in Study on Primary School Closures,2021-01-08,"A unified treatment of the renewable portfolio standards is given concerning direct methanol fuel. The current mechanism of electrocatalysis of methanol oxidation on platinum and non-platinum-containing alloys is summarized for the systematic improvement of the rate of electro-oxidation of methanol are discussed. Policy realignment under the five-year plan is discussed in length to demonstrate how policy, markets, and engineering designs contribute towards the development of model direct methanol fuel cells operational enhancement, and factors that affect critical performance parameters for commercial exploitation are summarized for catalytic formulations and cell design within the context of why this investment in technology, education, and finances is required within the global context of sustainable energy and energy independence as exposed by thirteenth the five-year plan. The prolog focuses on the way, whereas the section on methanol fuel cells on the how and the post log on what is expected post-COVID-19 era in science and technology as China pivots to a post-fossil fuel economy. China's industrial growth has been through internal market reforms and supplies side economics from the Chinese markets for fossil fuels except for petroleum. The latest renewable portfolio standards adopted have common elements as adopted from North American and the United Kingdom in terms of adaptation of obligation in terms of renewable portfolio standards as well as a realization that the necessity for renewables standards for the thirteen five year plan (from 2016 to 2020) need to less rigorously implemented due to performance targets that were met during the eleventh (06–10) and twelfth five-year plans (11–15) in terms of utilization of small coal-ire power plants, development of newer standards, led to an improvement of energy efficiency of 15 %, reduction of SO(x)/NO(x) by an average of 90 % and PM2.5 by 96 % over the last two five-year plans. The current phase of the plan has a focus on energy generation from coal and a slowing down of renewables or Renewable energy curtailment of approximately 400 T Wh renewables including 300 T Wh of non-hydro power, principally from Guangdong, and Jiangsu for transfer of hydropower and Zhejiang, Tianjin, Henan for non-hydro power transfer with Beijing and Shanghai playing important roles in renewables energy curtailment and realignment using an integrated approach to optimize each provinces energy portfolio. The realignment of the renewable energy portfolio indicates that the newly installed capacity in Sichuan, Yunnan, Inner Mongolia, and Zhejiang will account for less than 20 % of the current renewable energy portfolio but with the NO(x) SO(x) and PM(2.5) savings already accrued. The catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to methanol (70 / 110 million metric tons from all sources in 2019 for China/world) is one technological approach to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions and suggests that catalytic methanol synthesis by CO(2) hydrogenation may be a plausible approach, even if it is more expensive economically than methanol synthesis by the syngas approach. This is because the CO(2) emissions of the synthesis are lower than other synthesis methodologies. The Chinese government has placed a premium on cleaner air and water and may view such an approach as solving the dual issues of fuel substitution and reduction of CO(2). Thus, the coupling of hydrogen generation from sustainable energies sources (Solar 175 / 509 GW) or wind (211/591.5 GW in 2019) may be an attractive approach, as this requires slightly less water than coal gasification. Due to the thermodynamic requirement of lower operating pressure and higher operating pressure, currently, there is no single operational approach, although some practice approaches (220 °C at 48 atm using copper) and zinc oxide/alumina are suggested for optimal performance.","Yongjun, Gao; Liu, Jingbo; Bashir, Sajid",Catal Today,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0920586120306763; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920586120306763?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2020.10.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100579/,647

However, these pills were designed for female administration rather than males. This study was designed to investigate patterns of OCPs use and abuse among Jordanian males, according to the community pharmacists’ observations. METHOD: A mixed-method explanatory sequential study was conducted using an online self-administered survey, followed by semi-structured in-depth interviews for registered pharmacists, assistant pharmacists and pharmacy interns. The interviews were utilized using a conceptual framework. Inductive thematic analysis and descriptive/regression analyses were completed using Nvivo and SPSS, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 158 questionnaire responses and 22 interviews were included in our analysis. Around half (48.4%) of the questionnaire responses confirmed that males could use OCPs for hair growth enhancement, muscle gain and acne treatment 12.7%, 31.7% and 4.4%, respectively. Through the interviews, the participating pharmacists highlighted that males use OCPs mostly for bodybuilding purposes, according to recommendations by their coaches at the gym. The most abused OCPs containing estrogen (Ethinyl estradiol) and progestins (Drospirenone or Levonorgestrel). CONCLUSION: This study provided insight into unexpected uses of OCPs by males in Jordan. Community pharmacists have a crucial role in the management of OCPs use and abuse. However, restricted regulations and monitoring must be released and implemented on the community to limit such practices.","Barakat, Muna; Al-Qudah, Raja’a; Akour, Amal; Abu-Asal, Mona; Thiab, Samar; Dallal Bashi, Yahya H.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33961665/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251302,647

654106,Assessment of a Risk-Based Approach for Triaging Mammography Examinations During Periods of Reduced Capacity,2021-03-25,"BACKGROUND: Erectile dysfunction (ED), as the hallmark of endothelial dysfunction, could be a short‐ or long‐term complication of COVID‐19. Additionally, being ED a clinical marker and predictor of non‐communicable chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular, subjects with ED could potentially have a higher risk of contracting COVID‐19. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of ED among subjects with a reported diagnosis of COVID‐19 and to measure the association of COVID‐19 and ED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed data from the Sex@COVID online survey (performed between April 7 and May 4, 2020, in Italy) to retrieve a sample of Italian male sexually active subjects with reported SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. A matching sample of COVID‐19‐negative male sexually active subjects was also retrieved using propensity score matching in a 3:1 ratio. The survey used different standardized psychometric tools to measure effects of lockdown and social distancing on the intrapsychic, relational, and sexual health of Italian subjects. RESULTS: One hundred subjects were included in the analysis (25 COVID‐positive; 75 COVID‐negative). The prevalence of ED, measured with the Sexual Health Inventory for Men, was significantly higher in the COVID+ group (28% vs. 9.33%; p = 0.027). Logistic regression models confirmed a significant effect of COVID‐19 on the development of ED, independently of other variables affecting erectile function, such as psychological status, age, and BMI [OR 5.66, 95% CI: 1.50–24.01]. Likewise, subjects with ED were more likely to have COVID‐19, once corrected for age and BMI [OR 5.27, 95% CI: 1.49–20.09]. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: On top of well‐described pathophysiological mechanisms, there is preliminary evidence in a real‐life population of ED as a risk factor of developing COVID‐19 and possibly occurring as a consequence of COVID‐19. Universal vaccination against the COVID‐19 and the personal protective equipment could possibly have the added benefit of preventing sexual dysfunctions.","Sansone, Andrea; Mollaioli, Daniele; Ciocca, Giacomo; Colonnello, Elena; Limoncin, Erika; Balercia, Giancarlo; Jannini, Emmanuele A.",Andrology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33742540/; https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.13003,647

Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptor of human to initiate host invasion. Plethora of studies demonstrate the inhibition of Spike-ACE2 interactions to impair infection. The ancient Indian traditional medicine has been of great interest of Virologists worldwide to decipher potential antivirals. Hence, in this study, phytochemicals (1,952 compounds) from eight potential medicinal plants used in Indian traditional medicine were meticulously collated, based on their usage in respiratory disorders, along with immunomodulatory and anti-viral potential from contemporary literature. Further, these compounds were virtually screened against Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of Spike protein. The potential compounds from each plant were prioritized based on the binding affinity, key hotspot interactions at ACE2 binding region and glycosylation sites. Finally, the potential hits in complex with spike protein were subjected to Molecular Dynamics simulation (450 ns), to infer the stability of complex formation. Among the compounds screened, Tellimagrandin-II (binding energy of −8.2 kcal/mol and binding free energy of −32.08 kcal/mol) from Syzygium aromaticum L. and O-Demethyl-demethoxy-curcumin (binding energy of −8.0 kcal/mol and binding free energy of −12.48 kcal/mol) from Curcuma longa L. were found to be highly potential due to their higher binding affinity and significant binding free energy (MM-PBSA), along with favorable ADMET properties and stable intermolecular interactions with hotspots (including the ASN343 glycosylation site). The proposed hits are highly promising, as these are resultant of stringent in silico checkpoints, traditionally used, and are documented through contemporary literature. Hence, could serve as promising leads for subsequent experimental validations.","Umashankar, V.; Deshpande, Sanjay H.; Hegde, Harsha V.; Singh, Ishwar; Chattopadhyay, Debprasad",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34026798/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.672629,647
