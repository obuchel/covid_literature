183340,[Analysis of relation between the usage of corticosteroid in treatment and arthralgia as a sequela of SARS patients].,2004,"Study Objectives: During COVID-19, emergency medicine (EM) providers have labored to protect the health of their patients, often at the expense of their own well-being. Increased demands imposed on providers without intentional efforts to evaluate and improve wellness can lead to burnout, attrition, and compromise patient care. Practices that promote mindfulness, reflection and gratitude have been shown to reduce burnout. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Framework for Improving Joy In Work provides an approach to restore joy and engagement by first identifying elements that ""matter most” to health care workers. The objective of this study was to identify common themes and associations that contribute to EM provider and staff (1) joy in work, (2) gratitude, and (3) personal wellness. Methods: A descriptive study used an electronic survey tool with open-ended questions adapted from the IHI framework to assess what matters most. Q1: What brings you joy in your work? Q2: Thinking back to what matters most, what are you grateful for? Q3: What do you do to maintain your personal wellness? In Nov. 2020, email listservs were used to recruit a voluntary sample of emergency physicians, advanced practice providers APPs, residents, fellows, nurses and staff from 10 academic and community hospitals. Data were managed in Qualtrics and Excel. Qualitative analysis used inductive thematic coding by two authors independently, with verification by a third. Information redundancy signaled saturation for common themes. Pivot tables examined themes across demographics. Associations were analyzed using chi-square, Fisher’s exact test, and odds rations (95% CI). Results: Of 254 respondents, 63% were female and 89% identified as White. Roles were 32% physicians, 8% APPs, 16% residents/fellows, and 44% nurses/staff. Response rates were 39-54% for providers. Common themes for joy in work were patient care (47%) and teamwork/camaraderie (43%), followed by feeling valued/appreciated (13%), making a difference (13%), and teaching/mentoring (9%). EM providers at academic sites were more likely to find joy in teaching/mentoring than those in the community (p=0.01;OR 10.5, 95% CI 1.3-82.6). For gratitude, themes were teamwork/camaraderie (13%), family (12%), health (7%), and supportive work environment (7%). Themes for maintaining personal wellness were physical exercise (46%), time with family and friends (32%), hobbies (15%), and self-care (13%). Conclusions: Results of this study reveal common themes for EM providers and staff surrounding joy, gratitude, and wellness. By identifying elements that matter most, systems can take next steps in rejuvenating their health care team. Implications from our findings suggest that practices and future research to remove barriers and encourage meaningful provider-patient interactions, team camaraderie, teaching/mentoring, physical activity, and time with family/friends could increase joy and fulfillment for frontline health care workers.","Kelker, H.; Cushman, E.; Munson, C.; Yoder, K.; Musey, P.; Reed, K.; Henderson, B.; Vynas, P.; Johnson, O.; Welch, J.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.07.101,936
183429,[Prospective 2-year clinical study of patients with positive IgG-antibodies after recovering from severe acute respiratory syndrome].,2005,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an important pillar to prevent HIV transmission. Because of experimental and clinical shortcomings, mathematical models that integrate pharmacological, viral- and host factors are frequently used to quantify clinical efficacy of PrEP. Stochastic simulations of these models provides sample statistics from which the clinical efficacy is approximated. However, many stochastic simulations are needed to reduce the associated sampling error. To remedy the shortcomings of stochastic simulation, we developed three numerical methods that allow predicting the efficacy of arbitrary prophylactic regimen directly from a viral dynamics model, without sampling. We apply the methods to various hypothetical dolutegravir (DTG) prophylaxis scenarios. The approaches are verified against one another, as well as state-of-the-art stochastic simulation. While the methods are more accurate than stochastic simulation, they are superior in terms of computational performance. For example, a continuous 6-month prophylactic profile is computed within a few seconds on a laptop computer. The methods’ computational performance, therefore, substantially expands the horizon of feasible analysis in the context of PrEP, and possibly other applications. Author summary Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an important tool to prevent HIV transmission. However, experimental identification of parameters that determine prophylactic efficacy is extremely difficult. Clues about these parameters could prove essential for the design of next-generation PrEP compounds. Integrative mathematical models can fill this void: Based on stochastic simulation, a sample statistic can be generated, from which the prophylactic efficacy is estimated. However, for this sample statistic to be accurate, many simulations need to be performed. Here, we introduce three numerical methods to directly compute the prophylactic efficacy from a viral dynamics model, without the need for sampling. Based on several examples with dolutegravir (DTG) -based short- and long-term PrEP, as well as post-exposure prophylaxis we demonstrate the correctness of the new methods and their outstanding computational performance. Due to the methods’ computational performance, a number of analysis, including formal sensitivity analysis are becoming feasible with the proposed methods.","Zhang, Lanxin; Wang, Junyu; von Kleist, Max",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.22.453374,936

Araştırma amacı doğrultusunda, Airbnb listelerinin fiziksel ve mekansal özelliklerinin tahmin aracı olarak kullanıldığı sağkalım analizini yapmak için Cox’un Orantılı Tehlike Modeli kullanılmıştır. Araştırma bulgularına göre, fiziksel özellikler COVÍD öncesi bulgularla benzerlik gösterirken, mekansal özellikler COVÍD öncesi ve COVÍD sonrası karşılaştırmasında önemli farklılıklar göstermektedir. Çalışmanın alana iki yönlü katkısı vardır. Teorik olarak, araştırmanın bulguları, COVÍD-19 salgını sırasında değişen tüketici tercihlerinin daha iyi anlaşılması ve Airbnb listelerinin hayatta kalma oranlarını etkileyen faktörlerin belirlenmesinde mevcut literatüre katkı sağlamaktadır. Ayrıca bulgular, ev sahiplerine, özellikle COVÍD ile birlikte değişen mekansal müşteri tercihlerinin daha iyi anlaşılmasına yardımcı olabilicektir. Ayrıca, müşteri geri bildirimlerinin kalitesi ve miktarı, Airbnb ev sahiplerinin hizmet kalitelerini iyileştirmelerine, daha fazla müşteri çekmelerine ve değişen koşullara göre daha dirençli olmalarına yardımcı olabilecektir.Alternate abstract: This research investigates the survival probability of listings in the Airbnb platform during the COVID-19 period between January-October 2020 in Istanbul. In line with the research aim, Cox's Proportional Hazard Model is adopted to conduct survival analysis, where the physical and spatial attributes of Airbnb listings are used as predictors. Our findings show that while physical attributes show similarity to previous findings, spatial attributes show substantial differences in the Pre-COVID and Post-COVID comparison. The contributions of the study have two facets. Theoretically, this research's findings contribute to the current literature by understanding the changing consumer preferences and identifying the factors that affect Airbnb listings' survival rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings may also help practitioners understand changing customers' preferences during COVID, especially in terms of locational choices. Moreover, customer feedback's quality and quantity might help the Airbnb hosts to improve their service quality, attract more customers, and be more resilient under the changing conditions.","Türk, Umut Sap Serap",Business & Management Studies: An International Journal,https://doi.org/10.15295/bmij.v9i1.1752,936
184400,[Effect of SARS-associated coronavirus on peripheral blood picture and liver function].,2004,"With increasing frequency, people are using social media sites to obtain timely information about the world's grand challenges and this phenomenon is amplified during crises. However, little research has been conducted to determine how people participate and how their involvement can be promoted on social media sites, although the critical role played by those sites has been well documented. Based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study develops and tests a theoretical model to establish the effect of several factors with survey data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, in Saudi Arabia. The relationship was verified on a sample of 213 respondents active on Twitter, using Partial Least Square (PLS). The study found that attitude, perceived behavioural control and subjective norm affect Twitter users' active participation significantly within the context of a time of crisis. It also found a positive effect of utilitarian and hedonic values and trust. These results will provide a more comprehensive evaluation of Twitter users in grand challenges (and more specifically during a crisis) and furnish academics and managers with instructive guidance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Mohammed, A.; Ferraris, A.",Technology in Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101651,936
184893,[Comparison of serum biochemical features between SARS and other viral pneumonias].,2004,"Background: Sarcoma pts often receive aggressive, highly immunosuppressive therapy and may be at high risk for severe COVID-19. Demographics, outcomes and risk factors for pts with sarcoma and COVID-19 are unknown. We aimed to describe the course of COVID-19 in sarcoma pts and to identify factors associated with adverse outcomes. Methods: The COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (NCT04354701) is an international registry of pts with cancer and COVID-19. Adult pts (≥18 years old) with a diagnosis of sarcoma and laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included from 50 participating institutions. Data including demographics, sarcoma diagnosis and treatment, and course of COVID-19 infection were analyzed. Primary outcome was the composite rate of hospitalization or death at 30 days from COVID-19 diagnosis. Secondary outcomes were 30 day all-cause mortality, rate of hospitalization, O2 need, and ICU admission. Descriptive statistics and univariate Fisher tests are reported. Results: From March 17, 2020 to February 6, 2021, N=204 pts were included. Median follow up was 42 days. Median age was 58 years (IQR 43-67). 97 (48%) were male. 30 (15%) had ECOG performance status ≥2. 104 (51%) received cancer treatment, including surgery or radiation, within 3 months of COVID-19 diagnosis. 153 (75%) had active cancer, of whom 34 (22%) had lung metastases. 100 (49%) pts met the composite primary endpoint;96 (47%) were hospitalized and 18 (9%) died within 30 days from COVID-19 diagnosis. 64 (31%) required oxygen, and 16 (8%) required ICU admission. Primary endpoint rates were similar for pts who received cytotoxic chemotherapy (38/58, 66%) or targeted therapy (16/28, 57%). Pts with higher rates of the primary endpoint included patients ≥60 years old (59% vs 40%, OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.12-3.74, p=0.016), pts with ECOG PS ≥2 vs 0-1 (90% vs 41%, OR 12.2, 95% CI 3.44-66.8, p&lt;0.001), pts receiving any systemic therapy within 3 months of COVID-19 diagnosis (62% vs 39%, OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.43-4.97, p=0.001), and pts with lung metastases (68% vs 42%, OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.19- 6.79, p=0.013). Primary endpoint rates were similar across sarcoma subtypes (Table). Conclusions: This is the largest cohort study of pts with sarcoma and COVID-19 to date. Sarcoma pts have high rates of complications from COVID-19. Older patients, those with poor performance status, those recently receiving systemic cancer therapy, and those with lung metastases appear to have worse outcomes.","Wagner, M.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory factors in patients with methanol poisoning to determine the prognosis and outcome. Methods In this retrospective cross-sectional study, all patients with methanol poisoning, who had presented to the emergency department of Tohid Hospital, Sanandaj, Iran from 2011 to 2019 (8 years) were enrolled using census method. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to find the independent predictive factors of poor outcome in the mentioned patients. Result Methanol poisoning was diagnosed in 52 (11.55%) of the 450 cases admitted to hospital for alcohol intoxication. In multivariate analysis, time interval from methanol intake to hospital admission (OR=1.06; 95% CI= 1.00-1.11; p=0.04), respiratory arrest (OR=25.59; 95% CI= 1.37-478.13; p=0.03), and higher concentration of blood glucose (OR=1.03; 95% CI= 1.00-1.09; p=0.03) had a significant correlation with Poor outcomes. Conclusions Based on the findings of this study, delayed admission to hospital, respiratory arrest and hyperglycemia were identified as independent risk factors of poor outcome in methanol poisoning.","Yousefinejad, Vahid; Moradi, Badia; Mohammadi Baneh, Anvar; Sheikhesmaeili, Farshad; Babahajian, Asrin",Archives of academic emergency medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134965/,936

OBJECTIVE This article aims to provide an overview of the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). DISCUSSION SARS is caused by a new coronavirus thought to be of animal origin. The virus induces symptoms of atypical pneumonia, clinically indistinguishable from similar syndromes. The severity is such that a 15% mortality rate has been reported. No treatment has yet been identified as reliably successful. Transmission is by droplet spread, requiring close contact. Stringent infection control precautions in health care institutions, broad isolation measures in affected communities and international surveillance with barrier restrictions to travel have led to termination of the epidemic. As of July 11, 2003, 8437 people in 32 countries have been affected, with 813 deaths reported.","Whitby, Noela; Whitby, Michael",Australian family physician,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14596069/,936

190642,[Evaluation of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in treatment for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome].,2003,"Tumour cells of undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) consistently harbour Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genes. Expression of mRNA transcripts associated with EBV latency has been demonstrated in such cells. However, expression of EBV lytic genes has not been well elucidated, although various lines of evidence have suggested that there is EBV replication in NPC tumour cells. We have studied mRNA expression of representative EBV lytic genes by RT-PCR in nasopharynx biopsies obtained from NPC and control individuals. In both NPC and control biopsies, EBV lytic genes BZLF1, BALF2 and BCLF1 were detected readily. However, BRLF1 was detected in NPC biopsies only. The BRLF1 gene was then cloned and expressed in vitro, and the protein product, Rta, was used as an antigen to detect specific antibodies by immunoprecipitation in plasma samples obtained from NPC patients and healthy controls. IgG antibodies directed against Rta were detected in 44 of 53 NPC plasma samples (83.0%), but only in 1 of 53 control samples (1.9%). Furthermore, the antibody binding regions were found in the C-terminal two-thirds of Rta. This serological result confirms indirectly that BRLF1 is specifically expressed in NPC tumour cells. Rta might play an important role in NPC pathogenesis, considering its multiple functions in EBV replication and cell cycles. Moreover, the detection of IgG antibodies directed against Rta could be developed into a diagnostic parameter for NPC.","Feng, P; Ren, E C; Liu, D; Chan, S H; Hu, H",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10993929/,936

192275,[Clinical investigation of outbreak of nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome].,2003,"In the era of COVID19, research has been conducted at an extraordinary pace, eliminating the time from submission to publication to unprecedented levels. This is facilitated by preprint platforms and social media which can spread, reproduce and promote new knowledge with enormous speed. However, there are many concerns regarding the risk of potential deflection from the peer review process that some journals might have adopted, in order to manage the overwhelming wave of COVID19-related submissions. Another dimension of this problem, is the inequity and the publication hurdles that many non-COVID19 scientists might face, since review process of non-COVID19 papers is delayed and journal space is limited to serve the COVID19 literature. Besides the access to publishing, some scientists have redirected their scholarly activity towards coronavirus publications, either permanently or temporarily or even opportunistically. The latter might be attributed to the ease that COVID19 related articles are getting published and cited. This epidemiologic and potentially academic crisis might also be an opportunity for editors, journals and reviewers to create a new journalistic landscape where rapid, transparent and thorough review process can be offered to the authors based on the lessons learned from the current ongoing crisis.","Moris, Dimitrios",Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33455093/,936
192889,[Study on the damage of liver in patients with SARS].,2004,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a life-threatening and highly contagious disease caused by the novel SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Immunohistochemical staining for SARS-CoV in the tissue sections of SARS patients is helpful in investigations of the biologic behavior of this virus in human tissue, and to determine the target cells of this virus in different organs. METHODS We studied the pathologic specimens from 6 SARS patients by immunohistochemical staining using a specific antibody against SARS-CoV. RESULTS Positive viral staining was only found in the lung tissue taken from the patients who died in the early stage of the disease, usually less than 10 days after symptom onset. No positive staining was found in the lung tissue specimens collected in the mid-to-late stage of the disease. The SARS-CoV-infected cells had a patchy distribution and tended to be present in the periphery of the lung. Immunohistochemically, these viral-infected cells were located mainly along the alveolar space, had a cuboidal appearance, and were reactive to cytokeratin and surfactant protein C. This suggested that type II pneumocytes are the main target cell of SARS-CoV in the lung. Occasional intra-alveolar macrophages were also weakly reactive to SARS-CoV antibody. In addition to the lung, positive viral staining was also found in the mucosal epithelium of the large intestine in another patient who had the clinical symptom of diarrhea. No evidence of viral staining was found in other organs including kidney, liver, lymph node and spleen. The skeletal muscle specimens of 2 patients who had rhabdomyolysis were also negative for SARS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV is mainly present in the cytoplasm of type II pneumocytes and can only be detected in the lung tissue during the early stage of the disease. In the patient who had symptoms of diarrhea, SARS-CoV staining was also identified in the mucosal epithelium of the colon.","Hsiao, Cheng-Hsiang; Chang, Ming-Fu; Hsueh, Po-Ren; Su, Ih-Jen",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15818427/,936

OBJECTIVE SLEs influence the TRH and DEX/CRH tests in major depressive disorder when administered at the time of admission and improvement. METHODS The TRH and DEX/CRH tests were administered to patients hospitalized for major depressive disorders - on the 4th through the 7th hospital day and at the time of improvement. We measured DeltaMAX TSH, DeltaMAX ACTH, ACTH AUC, DeltaMAX cortisol, cortisol AUC, DeltaMAX ACTH/DeltaMAX TSH and DeltaMAX cortisol/DeltaMAX TSH. RESULTS SLEs were significantly negatively associated with DeltaMAX ACTH, ACTH AUC and cortisol AUC at the time of admission. However, these relationships lost significance at the time of improvement. The sample (41 patients at the time of admission, 18 patients at the time of improvement) was relatively small, which may have contributed to false-negative results. CONCLUSION SLEs may be negatively associated with the outcome of the DEX/CRH tests in major depressive disorder.

194384,[Analysis of mortal risk factors in 12 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome].,2003,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Recently, several previously unrecognized respiratory viral pathogens have been identified and several influenza A virus subtypes, previously known to infect poultry and wild birds, were transmitted to humans. Here we review the recent literature on these respiratory viruses. RECENT FINDINGS Human metapneumovirus has now been detected worldwide, causing severe respiratory tract illnesses primarily in very young, elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Animal models and reverse genetic techniques were designed for human metapneumovirus, and the first vaccine candidates have been developed. Considerable genetic and antigenic diversity was observed for human metapneumovirus, but the implication of this diversity for vaccine development and virus epidemiology requires further study. Two previously unrecognized human coronaviruses were discovered in 2004 in The Netherlands and Hong Kong. Their clinical impact and epidemiology are largely unknown and warrant further investigation. Several influenza A virus subtypes were transmitted from birds to humans, and these viruses continue to constitute a pandemic threat. The clinical symptoms associated with these zoonotic transmissions range from mild respiratory illnesses and conjunctivitis to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, sometimes resulting in death. More basic research into virus ecology and evolution and development of effective vaccines and antiviral strategies are required to limit the impact of influenza A virus zoonoses and the threat of an influenza pandemic. SUMMARY Previously unknown and emerging respiratory viruses are an important threat to human health. Development of virus diagnostic tests, antiviral strategies, and vaccines for each of these pathogens is crucial to limit their impact.","Fouchier, Ron Am; Rimmelzwaan, Guus F; Kuiken, Thijs; Osterhaus, Albert Dme",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15735418/,936

METHODS Between February 2016 and December 2019, 44 patients with in-field recurrence after prior irradiation of brain gliomas were irradiated with intensity-modulated proton therapy. Seven patients (15.9%) originally had low-grade (WHO grade I-II) gliomas, nine patients (20.4%) had anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III), and 28 patients (63.7%) had glioblastoma (WHO grade IV). All tumors were unresectable due to their localization. After a median time from the prior irradiation of 28.0 months [range, 12 to 173], patients received PT with 2.0 and 3.0 GyRBE per fraction, with median proton EQD2 (/=10) to a tumor of 55.0 GyRBE [range, 46.0 to 61.75]. Adjuvant chemotherapy (Temozolomide, or Procarbazine, Lomustine and vincristine, or Bevacizumab with Irinotecan) received 86.9% of the patients (n=40). Treatment-related toxicity was reported following CTCAE. RESULTS The median survival time was 12 months, with 1-year and 2-years overall survival (OS) amounting to 49.6% and 35.1%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9 months, with 1- and 2-years PFS of 30.5% and 10.2%, respectively. Twenty-six patients died by the time of analysis; among them were 5 non-cancer deaths (19.2%), and 4 patients (15.4%) died of chemotherapy-associated severe toxicity. The incidence rate of radiation-induced necrosis was 6.8% (3 events). CONCLUSIONS Based on our results, we suggest re-irradiation of recurrent brain gliomas with proton therapy is able to achieve reasonable tumor control. Low adverse events rate and promising outcomes make it a safe treatment option with curative intent, even in unresectable cases.","Gulidov, Igor; Kaprin, Konstantin Gordon Alexey Semenov Danil Gogolin Olga Lepilina Olga Golovanova Sergey Dujenko Kira Medvedeva Sergey Koryakin Sergey Ivanov Andrey",Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34268961/,936

MEASUREMENTS Percentage of infected hospital workers according to job category. RESULTS The cumulative incidence was highest among health care assistants, followed by physicians and nurses (8%, 5%, and 4%, respectively). Most hospital workers were infected from direct contact with patients with SARS, who primarily were in general wards and had unsuspected infection. At the time of contact, all hospital workers had used masks but not necessarily other protective devices. Affected hospital workers did not infect their families. CONCLUSION Before isolation of all patients with clinically confirmed or suspected SARS, routine use of several protective devices, and training of staff in infection control, many health care workers were infected with SARS from patients with unsuspected cases.","Ho, Alice S; Sung, Joseph J Y; Chan-Yeung, Moira",Annals of internal medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14530227/,936

COVID-19 was strongly suspected for 151 (48%) patients and suspicion was low for the remaining 92 (29%) patients. The percentage of patients with positive PCR results and the percentage of patients with abnormal laboratory test results increased as the CO-RADS score increased. Among patients with a CO-RADS score of 4 or 5, this percentage increased further when they also had lymphopenia or elevated LDH levels. We have adjusted the flowchart based on our findings. CONCLUSION In case of patients who have been referred to an emergency department for suspected COVID-19, a good COVID-19 risk assessment can be made on the basis of clinical signs, laboratory abnormalities and low-dose CT scans. Even before the results of the PCR test are known and even if the results are negative, patients can be classified as 'proven COVID-19 patients' using the algorithm.","Dofferhoff, A S M; Swinkels, A; Sprong, T; Berk, Y; Spanbroek, M; Nabuurs-Franssen, M H; Vermaat, M; van de Kerkhof, B; Willekens, M H C; Voss, A",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32406638/,936

We showed that niclosamide, an existing antihelminthic drug, was able to inhibit replication of a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV; viral antigen synthesis was totally abolished at a niclosamide concentration of 1.56 microM, as revealed by immunoblot analysis. Thus, niclosamide represents a promising drug candidate for the effective treatment of SARS-CoV infection.","Wu, Chang-Jer; Jan, Jia-Tsrong; Chen, Chi-Min; Hsieh, Hsing-Pang; Hwang, Der-Ren; Liu, Hwan-Wun; Liu, Chiu-Yi; Huang, Hui-Wen; Chen, Su-Chin; Hong, Cheng-Fong; Lin, Ren-Kuo; Chao, Yu-Sheng; Hsu, John T A",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15215127/,936
196728,[Organism distribution and drug resistance in 7 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome death patients with secondary bacteria infection].,2003,"Legionnaires' disease (LD) is caused by Legionella species, most of which live in water. The Mid-Atlantic region experienced a sharp rise in LD in 2003 coinciding with a period of record-breaking rainfall. To investigate a possible relationship, we analysed the association between monthly legionellosis incidence and monthly rainfall totals from January 1990 to December 2003 in five Mid-Atlantic states. Using negative binomial model a 1-cm increase in rainfall was associated with a 2.6% (RR 1.026, 95% CI 1.012-1.040) increase in legionellosis incidence. The average monthly rainfall from May to September 1990-2002 was 10.4 cm compared to 15.7 cm from May to September 2003. This change in rainfall corresponds to an increased risk for legionellosis of approximately 14.6% (RR 1.146, 95% CI 1.067-1.231). Legionellosis incidence increased during periods of increased rainfall; identification of mechanisms that increase exposure and transmission of Legionella during rainfall might lead to opportunities for prevention.","Hicks, L A; Rose, C E; Fields, B S; Drees, M L; Engel, J P; Jenkins, P R; Rouse, B S; Blythe, D; Khalifah, A P; Feikin, D R; Whitney, C G",Epidemiology and infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17121693/,936
196787,[Retrospective analysis on clinical features of 35 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome].,2003,"Respiratory infections are the third highest cause of death worldwide and influenza has the highest mortality rate among lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Diagnosis of LRTIs relies mostly on clinical symptoms and is not fully satisfactory. Influenza laboratory diagnosis improves the efficiency of prophylaxis or treatment of influenza by antiviral molecules and has a strong impact on the cost-effectiveness of curative treatment. Inappropriate treatment of patients may result in spreading of resistant strains. Molecular diagnostics play a central role in the surveillance and response of pandemic influenza due to highly pathogenic strains. Real-time assays can be used for diagnosis or surveillance purposes in humans and animals, and microarrays can be used to identify and monitor the spread of dangerous variants. Molecular assays are also useful to identify and distinguish influenza, other respiratory viruses and bacteria, although their cost-effectiveness must be proven on a large scale. As new antiviral options will be available to clinicians, a better treatment choice will benefit the patient and community. Recent progress in molecular techniques will be reviewed. Examples of real-time assays for the detection of influenza viruses, including the highly pathogenic influenza A strains H5N1 and H7N7, will be discussed. Promising new techniques that allow detailed genotyping of viruses or multiplex detection of several respiratory pathogens from a unique specimen will also be discussed. These techniques will, in the near future, significantly improve the quality of diagnosis and surveillance of respiratory pathogens.","Vernet, Guy",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17266457/,936

Antiviral drug development always remains a challenge to the scientists. Remdesivir has emerged as a promising molecule, based on results of clinical trials and observational studies and has receieved marketing approval for COVID-19 treatment under ""emergency use authorization"" in countries such as United States. Remdesivir is a newer antiviral drug that acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor targeting the viral genome replication process. Therapeutic efficacy was first demonstrated by suppressing viral replication in Ebola-infected rhesus monkeys. It is available for parenteral use with reasonable safety and tolerability profile. Multiple clinical trials are going on in many countries to evaluate its safety, efficacy and tolerability. Positive outcome will make the drug capable of meeting the demand generated by both the current pandemic and future outbreak.
