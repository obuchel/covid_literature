HAP2/GCS1, a TBV candidate, is critical for fertilization in Plasmodium. Here, the genetic diversity of PvHAP2 was studied in Plasmodium vivax parasite populations from the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). METHODS: Plasmodium vivax clinical isolates were collected in clinics from the China-Myanmar border region (135 samples), western Thailand (41 samples) and western Myanmar (51 samples). Near full-length Pvhap2 (nucleotides 13–2574) was amplified and sequenced from these isolates. Molecular evolution studies were conducted to evaluate the genetic diversity, selection and population differentiation. RESULTS: Sequencing of the pvhap2 gene for a total of 227 samples from the three P. vivax populations revealed limited genetic diversity of this gene in the GMS (π = 0.00036 ± 0.00003), with the highest π value observed in Myanmar (0.00053 ± 0.00009). Y133S was the dominant mutation in the China-Myanmar border (99.26%), Myanmar (100%) and Thailand (95.12%). Results of all neutrality tests were negative for all the three populations, suggesting the possible action of purifying selection. Codon-based tests identified specific codons which are under purifying or positive selections. Wright’s fixation index showed low to moderate genetic differentiation of P. vivax populations in the GMS, with F(ST) ranging from 0.04077 to 0.24833, whereas high levels of genetic differentiation were detected between the China-Myanmar border and Iran populations (F(ST) = 0.60266), and between Thailand and Iran populations (F(ST) = 0.44161). A total of 20 haplotypes were identified, with H2 being the abundant haplotype in China-Myanmar border, Myanmar and Thailand populations. Epitope mapping prediction of Pvhap2 antigen showed that high-score B-cell epitopes are located in the S307-G324, L429-P453 and V623-D637 regions. The E317K and D637N mutations located within S307-G324 and V623-D637 epitopes slightly reduced the predicted score for potential epitopes. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed a very low level of genetic diversity of pvhap2 gene among P. vivax populations in the Greater Mekong Subregion. The relative conservation of pvhap2 supports further evaluation of a Pvhap2-based TBV.

This chapter presents an evaluation framework that was designed to span school and university BL, including Initial Teacher Eduction (ITE). An appropriate evaluation framework must show how effective each BL design and implementation is, at the level of a term or semester of study, and at the larger scale, such as across primary, middle, or secondary school, or programmes of study such as an ITE bachelor or master’s. This chapter first identifies eight features from the literature that are necessary for a BL evaluation framework, and shows that existing models do not satisfy these requirements. Next, the chapter introduces the Blended and Engaged Learning Zones (BELZ), designed specifically for BL across schooling and university studies, and that satisfies these eight features. An example follows of a version of BELZ used to evaluate BL in the years prior to a substantial three-term long inquiry task. BELZ addresses the imbalance in the literature, as well as the needs in teaching practice, for an evaluation framework for BL across schooling and university study.","Willison, John","Critical Perspectives on Teaching, Learning and Leadership",500,7

With the aim to design α-glucosidase inhibitors with novel chemical scaffolds, three folds ligand and structure based virtual screening was applied. Initially linear quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) model was developed by a molecular operating environment (MOE) using a training set of thirty-two known inhibitors, which showed good correlation coefficient (r(2) = 0.88), low root mean square error (RMSE = 0.23), and cross-validated correlation coefficient r(2) (q(2) = 0.71 and RMSE = 0.31). The model was validated by predicting the biological activities of the test set which depicted r(2) value of 0.82, indicating the robustness of the model. For virtual screening, compounds were retrieved from zinc is not commercial (ZINC) database and screened by molecular docking. The best docked compounds were chosen to assess their pharmacokinetic behavior. Later, the α-glucosidase inhibitory potential of the selected compounds was predicted by their mode of binding interactions. The predicted pharmacokinetic profile, docking scores and protein-ligand interactions revealed that eight compounds preferentially target the catalytic site of α-glucosidase thus exhibit potential α-glucosidase inhibition in silico. The α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of those Hits were predicted by QSAR model, which reflect good inhibitory activities of these compounds. These results serve as a guidelines for the rational drug design and development of potential novel anti-diabetic agents.","Halim, Sobia Ahsan; Jabeen, Sumaira; Khan, Ajmal; Al-Harrasi, Ahmed",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),500,1

EV71 infection continues to cause serious problems in areas with outbreaks, because vaccines and antiviral therapies are not available. Lymphocytes are present in the brains of infected patients and mice, and they protect mice from infection by decreasing the viral burden. The chemokines responsible for recruiting lymphocytes to infected organs are yet to be identified. Among the lymphocyte chemokines detected, high levels of interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) are found in the plasma and cerebral spinal fluid of patients with brainstem encephalitis as compared with the levels of a monokine induced by gamma interferon (Mig). Using a murine model to investigate the induction of IP-10 by EV71 infection, we observed that EV71 infection significantly enhanced IP-10 protein expression in the serum and brain, with kinetics similar to viral titres in the blood and brain. Brain neurons of infected mice expressed IP-10. Using wild-type mice and IP-10 gene knockout mice to investigate the role of IP-10 in EV71 infection, we found that IP-10 deficiency significantly reduced levels of Mig in serum, and levels of gamma interferon and the number of CD8 T cells in the mouse brain. Absence of IP-10 significantly increased the mortality of infected mice by 45%, with slow virus clearance in several vital tissues. Our observations are consistent with a model where EV71 infection boosts IP-10 expression to increase gamma interferon and Mig levels, infiltration of CD8 T cells, virus clearance in tissues and the survival of mice.","Shen, Fang-Hsiu; Tsai, Chia-Chun; Wang, Li-Chiu; Chang, Kung-Chao; Tung, Yuk-Ying; Su, Ih-Jen; Chen, Shun-Hua",The Journal of general virology,500,1

METHODS Individuals with documented FKRP mutations were evaluated annually with a battery of established motor outcome measures including limited quantitative myometry and timed function measures. Results were analyzed using random coefficient regression to determine annual change in each measure. Due to the non-linear progression through the lifespan of the study participants, pediatric (<19 years) and adult (>19 years) cohorts were analyzed separately. Effect of genotype was evaluated in each cohort. RESULTS Sixty-nine participants (30 pediatric, 44 adult) with at least two evaluations were included. There was a small but statistically significant decline in timed motor function measures in both pediatric and adult cohorts. Genotype significantly affected rate of decline in the pediatric but not the adult cohort. Some pediatric patients who are homozygous for the c.826C>A mutation showed improving motor performance in adolescence. Performance on the 10-meter walk/run was highly correlated with other timed function tests. CONCLUSIONS There is a slow annual decline in motor function in adults with FKRP mutations that can be detected with standard motor outcome measures, while the results in the pediatric population were more variable and affected by genotype.

The purpose of this study was to compare downstream medical utilization-based outcomes (costs, visits, recurrent episodes) after an initial diagnosis of patellofemoral pain based on pre-injury utilization of opioids. METHOD A total of 85,7880 consecutive patients were followed for a full 12 months before and 24 months after an initial diagnosis of patellofemoral pain (January 2009 to December 2013). Data were sourced from the Military Health System Data Repository, a single-payer closed government system. Opioid prescription fills were identified, and medical visits and costs were calculated for all knee-related medical care, to include recurrence rates in the 2-year surveillance period. RESULTS A relatively small number of individuals filled an opioid prescription in the year prior (n = 1746; 2.0%); however, these individuals had almost twice the mean costs of knee-related medical care ($1557 versus %802) and medical visits (8.4 versus 4.0). Patients with prior opioid use were more likely to have at least 1 recurrent episode of knee pain (relative risk 1.58, 95% CI 1.51, 1.65) with a higher mean number of episodes of knee pain (1.5 vs 1.8). The use of opioids with higher risk of misuse or dependency (Schedule II or III) resulted in greater medical costs (for any reason) and recurrent episodes of knee pain compared to the use of opioids in a lower risk category (Schedule IV). CONCLUSIONS Prior opioid utilization was associated with a greater number of recurrent episodes of knee pain and higher downstream medical costs compared with individuals without prior opioid use. For individuals with prior opioid utilization, opioids with higher risk of misuse or dependency (Schedule II or III) resulted in greater medical costs (for any reason) and recurrent episodes compared to the use of lower-risk opioids (Schedule IV). Key Points • Patients with prior opioid use had much greater knee-related medical costs compared to patients without prior opioid use. • Patients with prior opioid use were more likely to have additional episodes of knee pain in the following 2 years compared to patients without prior opioid use. • Prior opioid use has predicted higher costs and poor outcomes after surgery, but this is the first study to confirm similar findings in non-surgical patients.","Rhon, Daniel I; Cook, Chad E; Cleland, Joshua A; Snodgrass, Suzanne J",Clinical rheumatology,500,16

At the same time, dengue outbreaks were occurring in two of the Federated States of Micronesia's other three states. The cause of AFI was suspected to be dengue; however, by the end of October, only one of 39 samples was positive for dengue. The objective of the investigation was to establish the cause of the outbreak. METHODS A line list was created and data analysed by time, place, person and clinical features. Reported symptoms were compared with the published symptoms of several diagnoses and laboratory testing undertaken. RESULTS Of the 168 suspected cases, 62% were less than 20 years of age and 60% were male. The clinical features of the cases were not typical for dengue but suggestive of respiratory illness. Nasopharyngeal swabs were subsequently collected and found to be positive for influenza. Public health measures were undertaken and the AFI returned to expected levels. DISCUSSION Clinical diagnosis of acute febrile illness (AFI) can often be difficult and misleading. This can mean that opportunities for preventive measures early on in an outbreak are missed. In any outbreak, descriptive epidemiological analyses are valuable in helping to ascertain the cause of the outbreak.","Hoy, Damian; Yichiro, Yoster; Otoko, Kasian; Heldart, Helden; Meyshine, Andita; Assito, Prisca; Pretrick, Moses; Souares, Yvan; Hancock, Thane; Durand, Mark; Roth, Adam",Western Pacific surveillance and response journal : WPSAR,500,1

METHODS This is a retrospective observational study of prospectively collected data on all consecutive purely LDN surgeries performed at a tertiary academic medical center (n = 1325), performed between March 2000 and October 2013. RESULTS Over time, LDN was performed on older patients, changing from a mean of 35.7 years in 2000 to 41.2 years in 2013 (P <.001). Additionally, mean blood loss decreased from 75 mL in 2000 to 21.6 mL in 2013 (P <.001). However, body mass index, operative time, and length of stay remained similar. Overall, there were 105 (7.9%) complications: Clavien grade 1 (n = 81, 6.1%) and grade 2 or higher (n = 23, 1.8%). Procedure duration, blood loss, surgeon, year of procedure, laterality, body mass index, age, and gender did not significantly predict complications. There was no significant difference for Clavien complication rates between the early learning period (first 150 cases) and the rest of the series. CONCLUSION With continual refinement with LDN techniques based on intraoperative observations and technological advances, complication rates remain consistently low, despite increasing donor age.","Treat, Eric G; Schulam, Peter G; Gritsch, Hans A; Liu, Chia-Hung; Xiong, Siwei; Passos, Felipe; Chuang, Ryan; Hu, Jim C",Urology,500,7

The length of the staple line and serosal laceration was also determined. RESULTS There was a moderate negative correlation between tissue thickness and secure staple formation. Tri-staple reloads (purple, black) offered more secure staple formation compared with Universal green reload. Although slow firing enhanced secure staple formation, its effect was greater when using green reload, compared with Tri-staple reloads. Significantly shorter staple line length and longer serosal laceration was observed in the thick tissue. Although the cartridge type did not influence lengths of the staple line or serosal laceration, both were better in the slow-firing group.

However, clinical translation of MSC-based therapies is hindered due to loss of MSC regenerative properties during large-scale expansion and low survival/retention post-delivery. These limitations might be overcome by designing hydrogel culture platforms to modulate the MSC microenvironment. Hydrogel systems could be engineered to i) promote MSC proliferation and maintain regenerative properties (i.e., stemness and secretion) during ex vivo expansion, ii) improve MSC survival, retention, and engraftment in vivo, and/or iii) direct the MSC secretory profile using tailored biochemical and biophysical cues. Herein, it is reviewed how hydrogel material properties (i.e., matrix modulus, viscoelasticity, dimensionality, cell adhesion, and porosity) influence MSC secretion, mediated through cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. In addition, it is highlighted how biochemical cues (i.e., small molecules, peptides, and proteins) can improve and direct the MSC secretory profile. Last, the authors' perspective is provided on future work toward the understanding of how microenvironmental cues influence the MSC secretome, and designing the next generation of biomaterials, with optimized biophysical and biochemical cues, to direct the MSC secretory profile for improved clinical translation outcomes.","Wechsler, Marissa E; Rao, Varsha V; Borelli, Alexandra N; Anseth, Kristi S",Advanced healthcare materials,500,17

We included studies that reported sufficient data to estimate the effect of any form of eye protection including face shields and variants, goggles, and glasses, on subsequent confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2. Findings: We screened 898 articles and included 6 reports of 5 observational studies from 4 countries (USA, India, Columbia, and United Kingdom) that tested face shields, googles and wraparound eyewear on 7567 healthcare workers. The three before-and-after and one retrospective cohort studies showed statistically significant and substantial reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infections favouring eye protection with odds ratios ranging from 0.04 to 0.6, corresponding to relative risk reductions of 96% to 40%. These reductions were not explained by changes in the community rates. However, the one case-control study reported odds ratio favouring no eye protection (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.99, 3.0). The high heterogeneity between studies precluded any meaningful meta-analysis. None of the studies adjusted for potential confounders such as other protective behaviours, thus increasing the risk of bias, and decreasing the certainty of evidence to very low. Interpretation: Current studies suggest that eye protection may play a role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers. However, robust comparative trials are needed to clearly determine effectiveness of eye protections and wearability issues in both healthcare and general populations.","Byambasuren, O.; Beller, E.; Clark, J.; Collignon, P.; Glasziou, P.",,500,20

Deep generative models have demonstrated their ability to find such molecules by exploring a huge chemical space efficiently. An effective way to obtain molecules with desired target properties is the preservation of critical scaffolds in the generation process. To this end, we propose a domain aware generative framework called 3D-Scaffold that takes 3D coordinates of the desired scaffold as an input and generates 3D coordinates of novel therapeutic candidates as an output while always preserving the desired scaffolds in generated structures. We show that our framework generates predominantly valid, unique, novel, and experimentally synthesizable molecules that have drug-like properties similar to the molecules in the training set. Using domain specific datasets, we generate covalent and non-covalent antiviral inhibitors. To measure the success of our framework in generating therapeutic candidates, generated structures were subjected to high throughput virtual screening via docking simulations, which shows favorable interaction against SARS-CoV-2 main protease and non-structural protein endoribonuclease (NSP15) targets. Most importantly, our model performs well with relatively small volumes of training data and generalizes to new scaffolds, making it applicable to other domains.","Joshi, Rajendra P.; Gebauer, Niklas W.

By phylogenetic analysis, SARS-CoV is distinct from known CoVs and most closely related to group 2 CoVs. However, no antigenic cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and known CoVs was conclusively and consistently demonstrated except for group 1 animal CoVs. We analyzed this cross-reactivity by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot analysis using specific antisera to animal CoVs and SARS-CoV and SARS patient convalescent-phase or negative sera. Moderate two-way cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and porcine CoVs (transmissible gastroenteritis CoV [TGEV] and porcine respiratory CoV [PRCV]) was mediated through the N but not the spike protein, whereas weaker cross-reactivity occurred with feline (feline infectious peritonitis virus) and canine CoVs. Using Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant SARS-CoV N protein and fragments, the cross-reactive region was localized between amino acids (aa) 120 to 208. The N-protein fragments comprising aa 360 to 412 and aa 1 to 213 reacted specifically with SARS convalescent-phase sera but not with negative human sera in ELISA; the fragment comprising aa 1 to 213 cross-reacted with antisera to animal CoVs, whereas the fragment comprising aa 360 to 412 did not cross-react and could be a potential candidate for SARS diagnosis. Particularly noteworthy, a single substitution at aa 120 of PRCV N protein diminished the cross-reactivity. We also demonstrated that the cross-reactivity is not universal for all group 1 CoVs, because HCoV-NL63 did not cross-react with SARS-CoV. One-way cross-reactivity of HCoV-NL63 with group 1 CoVs was localized to aa 1 to 39 and at least one other antigenic site in the N-protein C terminus, differing from the cross-reactive region identified in SARS-CoV N protein. The observed cross-reactivity is not a consequence of a higher level of amino acid identity between SARS-CoV and porcine CoV nucleoproteins, because sequence comparisons indicated that SARS-CoV N protein has amino acid identity similar to that of infectious bronchitis virus N protein and shares a higher level of identity with bovine CoV N protein within the cross-reactive region. The TGEV and SARS-CoV N proteins are RNA chaperons with long disordered regions. We speculate that during natural infection, antibodies target similar short antigenic sites within the N proteins of SARS-CoV and porcine group 1 CoVs that are exposed to an immune response. Identification of the cross-reactive and non-cross-reactive N-protein regions allows development of SARS-CoV-specific antibody assays for screening animal and human sera.","Vlasova, Anastasia N; Zhang, Xinsheng; Hasoksuz, Mustafa; Nagesha, Hadya S; Haynes, Lia M; Fang, Ying; Lu, Shan; Saif, Linda J",Journal of virology,500,1

Rigorous risk assessment is particularly challenging in a context where surveillance may be subject to under-ascertainment and a selection bias towards more severe cases. We would like to assess whether the virus is capable of causing widespread human epidemics, and whether self-sustaining transmission is already under way. Here we review possible transmission scenarios for MERS-CoV and their implications for risk assessment and control. We discuss how existing data, future investigations and analyses may help in reducing uncertainty and refining the public health risk assessment and present analytical approaches that allow robust assessment of epidemiological characteristics, even from partial and biased surveillance data. Finally, we urge that adequate data be collected on future cases to permit rigorous assessment of the transmission characteristics and severity of MERS-CoV, and the public health threat it may pose. Going beyond minimal case reporting, open international collaboration, under the guidance of the World Health Organization and the International Health Regulations, will impact on how this potential epidemic unfolds and prospects for control.","Cauchemez, S; Van Kerkhove, M D; Riley, S; Donnelly, C A; Fraser, C; Ferguson, N M",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,500,33

Synthetic peptides M1-31 derived from the N-terminal epitope and M132-161 derived from the C-terminal epitope were highly reactive with all of the convalescent-phase sera from 40 SARS patients but not with 30 control serum samples from healthy blood donors, suggesting their potential application for serologic diagnosis of SARS. We showed that both peptides (M1-31 and M132-161) were able to induce high titers of antibody responses in the immunized rabbits, highlighting their antigenicity and immunogenicity. These findings provide important information for developing SARS diagnostics and vaccines.","He, Yuxian; Zhou, Yusen; Siddiqui, Pamela; Niu, Jinkui; Jiang, Shibo",Journal of clinical microbiology,500,2

OBJECTIVE To determine the 'isolation prevalence' of NTM in 2007 and compare it with previously published research that examined the increasing rates of isolation of NTM from clinical pulmonary specimens between 1997 and 2003. METHODS Isolation prevalence was investigated retrospectively by reviewing a cohort of all positive pulmonary NTM culture results from the Tuberculosis and Mycobacteriology Laboratory, Public Health Laboratory (Toronto, Ontario) in 2007, which identifies at least 95% of NTM isolates in Ontario. Isolation prevalence was calculated as the number of persons with a pulmonary isolate in a calendar year divided by the contemporary population and expressed per 100,000 population. Changes in isolation prevalence from previous years were assessed for statistical significance using generalized linear models with a negative binomial distribution. RESULTS In 2007, 4160 pulmonary isolates of NTM were collected from 2463 patients. The isolation prevalence of all species (excluding Mycobacterium gordonae) was 19 per 100,000 population in 2007 - an increase from previous observations reported for Ontario - corresponding to an average annual increase of 8.5% from 1997 to 2007 (P<0.0001). Average annual increases in isolation prevalence of Mycobacterium avium complex (8.8%, P<0.0001) and Mycobacterium xenopi (7.3%, P=0.0005) were largely responsible for the overall increase, while prevalence rates of rapidly growing mycobacteria remained relatively stable. CONCLUSION The isolation prevalence of pulmonary NTM continues to increase significantly in Ontario, supporting the belief that pulmonary NTM disease is increasingly common.","Al Houqani, Mohammed; Jamieson, Frances; Chedore, Pamela; Mehta, Mauli; May, Kevin; Marras, Theodore K",Canadian respiratory journal,500,11

Previously, mutations in the equine arteritis virus (EAV) nsp10 ZBD were shown to block arterivirus reproduction by disrupting RNA synthesis and possibly virion biogenesis. Here, we characterized the ATPase and helicase activities of bacterially expressed mutant forms of nsp10 and its human coronavirus 229E ortholog, nsp13, and correlated these in vitro activities with specific virus phenotypes. Replacement of conserved Cys or His residues with Ala proved to be more deleterious than Cys-for-His or His-for-Cys replacements. Furthermore, denaturation-renaturation experiments revealed that, during protein refolding, Zn2+ is essential for the rescue of the enzymatic activities of nidovirus helicases. Taken together, the data strongly support the zinc-binding function of the N-terminal domain of nidovirus helicases. nsp10 ATPase/helicase deficiency resulting from single-residue substitutions in the ZBD or deletion of the entire domain could not be complemented in trans by wild-type ZBD, suggesting a critical function of the ZBD in cis. Consistently, no viral RNA synthesis was detected after transfection of EAV full-length RNAs encoding ATPase/helicase-deficient nsp10 into susceptible cells. In contrast, diverse phenotypes were observed for mutants with enzymatically active nsp10, which in a number of cases correlated with the activities measured in vitro. Collectively, our data suggest that the ZBD is critically involved in nidovirus replication and transcription by modulating the enzymatic activities of the helicase domain and other, yet unknown, mechanisms.","Seybert, Anja; Posthuma, Clara C; van Dinten, Leonie C; Snijder, Eric J; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Ziebuhr, John",Journal of virology,500,1

At the same time, probabilistic shaping (PS) technology is used to further optimize the system that has effectively improved the bit error performance by about 1 dB. The proposed encryption technique for OFDM-PON has been demonstrated successfully with the help of experiments. The generated OFDM signal is modulated by the quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) technique, which transmitted 16 Gb/s data rate across a 25 km fiber span of standard single-mode fiber. The values of bit error rate (BER) and peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) are analyzed during the experiments, and the obtained results show that the proposed security-enhanced OFDM-PON has high sensitivity and security and can be well compatible with PS and OFDM technologies. The proposed scheme has very reliable security performance and also has excellent benefit improvement, which is very promising in the future PS-OFDM-PON.","Zhao, Jianye; Liu, Bo; Mao, Yaya; Ullah, Rahat; Ren, Jianxin; Chen, Shuaidong; Jiang, Lei; Han, Shun; Zhang, Jingyi; Shen, Jiajia",Opt Express,500,22

The purpose of this study is to report our experience on management of these aspirated foreign body (FB) with rigid bronchoscopy during the COVID 19 pandemic. This is a retrospective study which included 100 children less than 17 years of age, diagnosed with suspected FBA and underwent rigid bronchoscopy for its removal between March 2020 and March 2021. Guardians of all female children with history of FBA, had to go through medicolegal enquiry considering the possibility of female infanticide. Analysis of data was made of the demographic details, characteristics and location of the aspirated FB, treatment modalities and difficulties encountered. Among the 100 patients included in the study, 67% were under 3 years of age. The male to female ratio was 2.23:1. 69% of the FB’s were most frequently found in the right main bronchus. 63 cases of the removed FB were organic materials such as nuts. Tracheobronchial FB’s should be suspected in children who have sudden onset of cough and respiratory distress, even when physical and radiographic evidence is absent. Mortality due to FBA is preventable by early intervention with bronchoscopy. During the Covid 19 pandemic before performing any emergency procedure, prior preoperative planning and use of personal protective equipment is important, considering the very high risk of transmission of the virus due to aerosol generation.","Hameed, Shaul Reddy Y Mounika",Indian journal of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery : official publication of the Association of Otolaryngologists of India,500,20

Second, the findings presented that this miRNA had a considerable role in PI3K/Act, endocytosis, and type 2 diabetes, moreover, it may play a critical role in the prevention of GRP78 production and the virus entering, proliferation and development. Third, nearly 1033 medicinal herbal compounds were collected and docked with ACE2, TMPRSS2, GRP78, and AT1R receptors, which were the most noticeable receptors in causing the COVID-19. Among them, there were three common compounds including berbamine, hypericin, and hesperidin, which were more effective and appropriate to prevent the COVID-19 infection. Also, it was revealed some of these chemical compounds which had a greater affinity for AT1R receptor inhibitors can be suitable therapeutic targets for inhibiting AT1R and preventing the adverse side effects of this receptor. According to the result, clinical assessment of these three herbal compounds and hsa-miR-1307-3p may have significant outcomes for the prevention, control, and treatment of COVID-19 infection.","Balmeh, Negar; Mahmoudi, Samira; Mohammadi, Niloofar; Karabedianhajiabadi, Anasik",Inform.

To clarify that, we have assessed the values of several inflammatory biomarkers and hemocytometry variables in a cohort of obstetric patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and we have correlated the values at admission with the need of oxygen supplementation during the hospitalization. Overall, among 62 (27.3%) pregnant women and 165 (72.7%) postpartum women, 21 (9.2%) patients received oxygen supplementation and 2 (0.9%) required admission to intensive care unit but none died. During hospitalization leukocytes (p < 0.001), neutrophils (p < 0.001), neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (p < 0.001) and C reactive protein (p < 0.001) decreased significantly, whereas lymphocytes (p < 0.001), platelets (p < 0.001) and ferritin (p = 0.001) increased. Lymphocyte values at admission were correlated with oxygen need, with a 26% higher risk of oxygen supplementation for each 1000 cells decreases. Overall, in obstetric patients hospitalized with COVID-19, C reactive protein is the inflammatory biomarker that better mirrors the course of the disease whereas D-dimer or ferritin are not reliable predictors of poor outcome.

Chromatin remodelling was observed in both innate and adaptive immune cells in the individuals convalescing from COVID-19. Compared with healthy donors, recovered individuals contained abundant TBET-enriched CD16+ and IRF1-enriched CD14+ monocytes with sequential trained and activated epigenomic states. The B-cell lineage in recovered individuals exhibited an accelerated developmental programme from immature B cells to antibody-producing plasma cells. Finally, an integrated analysis of single-cell T cell-receptor clonality with the chromatin accessibility landscape revealed the expansion of putative SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells with epigenomic profiles that promote the differentiation of effector or memory cells. Overall, our data suggest that immune cells of individuals convalescing from COVID-19 exhibit global remodelling of the chromatin accessibility landscape, indicative of the establishment of immunological memory.","You, Maojun; Chen, Liang; Zhang, Dawei; Zhao, Peng; Chen, Zhu; Qin, En-Qiang; Gao, Yanan; Davis, Mark M; Yang, Pengyuan",Nat Cell Biol,500,2

Utilising semi-structured interviews with project managers, this paper examined the barriers to project delivery using virtual teams in Nigeria. The findings indicated that barriers to project delivery using virtual teams usually emerge from organisations and their project teams. The present study validates the position that project delivery in virtual teams requires additional efforts to attain their objectives through effective communications and the adoption of appropriate technology. It concluded by reiterating the need for project managers to develop strategies for fostering trust and constantly clarifying project goals and guidelines in virtual teams. © 2021 The Authors.

The need to maintain social distance poses a significant challenge to the international communities particularly between populations, educators and students. Though elicited by COVID-19 pandemic, the focal point of this challenge remains how to offer learning opportunities to students while stakeholders make efforts to contain an awfully virulent pandemic. In Europe and elsewhere, technology has helped with distance learning;assisting individuals on the margins of society and those in formal economy to achieve learning objectives despite a compulsory social distance regime. In other areas of the world such as Africa, correlation between technology and affordability has become a new frontier for continuing education. Encumbrances brought about by COVID-19 have deeply subverted education, state security, sociopolitical stability and economic development, which in turn create or preserve untoward anomaly. In this light, Africa has become the ground zero of disorientation where disorganized criminal groups fester due to poor education and fewer opportunities. The article examines the effect of COVID-19 in the continuing tertiary education relations and concludes that while blended learning is conceivable in Nigeria, rural schools might not benefit from the programme due to truncated development in communication and low level of technology.

The phylogeny analyses of whole genome stated that four proteins reflected the close ancestral relation of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-COV-1 and bat coronavirus. Numerous immunogenic epitopes (both T cell and B cell) were generated from the common fragments which were further ranked on the basis of antigenicity, transmembrane topology, conservancy level, toxicity and allergenicity pattern and population coverage analysis. Top putative epitopes were combined with appropriate adjuvants and linkers to construct a novel multiepitope subunit vaccine against COVID-19. The designed constructs were characterized based on physicochemical properties, allergenicity, antigenicity and solubility which revealed the superiority of construct V3 in terms safety and efficacy. Essential molecular dynamics and normal mode analysis confirmed minimal deformability of the refined model at molecular level. In addition, disulfide engineering was investigated to accelerate the stability of the protein.

Improving the tabulation of direct and indirect deaths on death certificates will require concerted efforts and consensus across medical institutions and public health agencies. In addition, actionable estimates of excess mortality will require timely access to standardized and structured vital registry data, which should be shared directly at the state level to ensure rapid response for local governments. Correct attribution of direct and indirect deaths and estimation of excess mortality are complementary goals that are critical to our understanding of the pandemic and its effect on human life.","Kiang, Mathew V; Irizarry, Rafael A; Buckee, Caroline O; Balsari, Satchit",Ann. intern. med,500,20

This demonstrates collusion between epidemiology and racial capitalism because it obscures structural influences, absolving industries of responsibility for worker safety. In an empirical example, we analyzed economic implications of race-based metrics widely used in occupational epidemiology. In the United States, White adults have better average lung function and worse hearing than Black adults. Impaired lung function and impaired hearing are both criteria for workers' compensation claims, which are ultimately paid by industry. Compensation for respiratory injury is determined using a race-specific algorithm. For hearing, there is no race adjustment. Selective use of race-specific algorithms for workers' compensation reduces industries' liability for worker health, illustrating racial capitalism operating within public health. Widespread and unexamined belief in inherent physiological inferiority of Black Americans perpetuates systems that limit industry payouts for workplace injuries. We see a parallel in the epidemiology of COVID-19 disparities. We tell stories of industries implicated in the outbreak and review how they exemplify racial capitalism.

SARS-CoV-2 remains dormant in the CNS leading to neurological complications. The wide expression of ACE2 in the brain raises concern for its involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Though, the mechanistic insights about blood-brain barriers (BBB) crossing by SARS-CoV-2 and further brain infection are still not clear. Moreover, the mechanism behind dormant SARS-CoV-2 infections leading to chronic neurological disorders needs to be unveiled. There is an urgent need to find out the risk factor involved in COVID-19-associated neurological disease. Therefore, the role of immune-associated genes in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 associated neurological diseases is presented which could contribute to finding associated genetic risk factors. METHOD: The search utilizing multiple databases, specifically, EMBASE, PubMed (Medline), and Google Scholar was performed. Moreover, the literature survey on the involvement of COVID-19, neuropathogenesis, and its consequences was done. DESCRIPTION: Persistent inflammatory stimuli may promote the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. An increased expression level of cytokine, chemokine, and decreased expression level of immune cells has been associated with the COVID-19 patient. Cytokine storm was observed in severe COVID-19 patients. The nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be neuroinflammatory. Genes of immune response could be associated with neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: The present review will provide a useful framework and help in understanding COVID-19-associated neuropathogenesis. Experimental studies on immune-associated genes in COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations could be helpful to establish its neuropathogenesis.","Singh, HariOm; Singh, Amita; Khan, Abdul Arif; Gupta, Vivek",Microb Pathog,500,1

METHODS: We undertook secondary analysis of 248 care homes in Norfolk, UK. The dataset counted nurses, care workers and non-care workers, their status (available, absent due to leave or sickness and extra staff needed to address the coronavirus pandemic) and residents (if any) with suspected COVID-19 in the period 6 April to 6 May 2020. Concurrent descriptions of access by the home to personal protection equipment (PPE: gloves, masks, eye protection, aprons and sanitizer) were in the data. PPE access was categorized as (most to least) green, amber or red. We undertook two-stage modelling, first for suspected COVID-19 cases amongst residents and second relating any increases in case counts after introduction to staffing or PPE levels. RESULTS: Counts of non-care workers had strongest relationships (P < 0.05) to introduction of suspected SARS-CoV-2 to the homes. Higher staff levels and more severe PPE shortages were linked to higher case counts (P < 0.05) during the monitoring period. CONCLUSION: Managing aspects of staff interaction with residents and some working practices might reduce ingression to and spread of COVID-19-like illness within care homes.","Brainard, Julii; Rushton, Steven; Winters, Tim; Hunter, Paul R",J. public health (Oxf),500,1

This study was conducted via a web-based survey using quota sampling to ensure representativeness of the Japanese population aged 20-64 years. A cross-sectional study of 11,342 participants (5,734 males and 5,608 females) was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire that included the Japanese version of the Kessler 6 Psychological Distress Scale (K6) and questions related to the pandemic, SES, and lifestyle. The prevalence of psychological distress, represented by a K6 score of 5 or more, was 50.3% among males and 52.6% among females. Both males and females with annual household incomes less than 2 million yen and males aged in their twenties had significantly higher K6 scores than those with annual household incomes above 2 million yen and males aged over 30 years. Binary logistic regression analyses found pandemic-related factors such as medical history, inability to undergo clinical tests immediately, having trouble in daily life, unavailability of groceries, new work style, and vague anxiety; SES-related factors such as lesser income; and lifestyle-related factors such as insufficient rest, sleep, and nutritious meals to be significantly related to psychological distress. Psychological distress was more prevalent among people with low income and in younger generations than among other groups.

Quantification of complex non-intuitive dynamics and transport of pathogen laden respiratory particles in indoor flows has been of specific interest. Here we present a Lagrangian computational approach towards quantification of human-to-human exposure quantifiers, and identification of pathways by which flow organizes transmission. We develop a Lagrangian viral exposure index in a parametric form, accounting for key parameters such as building and layout, ventilation, occupancy, biological variables. We also employ a Lagrangian computation of the Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent field to identify hidden patterns of transport. A systematic parametric study comprising a set of 120 simulations, yielding a total of 1,320 different exposure index computations are presented. Results from these simulations enable: (a) understanding the otherwise hidden ways in which air flow organizes the long-range transport of such particles; and (b) translating the micro-particle transport data into a quantifier for understanding infection exposure risks.","Wilson, Joseph; Miller, Shelly L; Mukherjee, Debanjan",,500,4

These include the membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that, among other functions, downregulate cell surface proteins involved in adaptive immunity. The RING-CH domain of MARCH proteins is thought to function by catalyzing the ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tails (CTs) of target proteins, leading to their degradation. MARCH proteins have recently been reported to target retroviral envelope glycoproteins (Env) and vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G). However, the mechanism of antiviral activity remains poorly defined. Here we show that MARCH8 antagonizes the full-length forms of HIV-1 Env, VSV-G, Ebola virus glycoprotein (EboV-GP), and the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), thereby impairing the infectivity of virions pseudotyped with these viral glycoproteins. This MARCH8-mediated targeting of viral glycoproteins requires the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the RING-CH domain. We observe that MARCH8 protein antagonism of VSV-G is CT dependent. In contrast, MARCH8-mediated targeting of HIV-1 Env, EboV-GP, and SARS-CoV-2 S protein by MARCH8 does not require the CT, suggesting a novel mechanism of MARCH-mediated antagonism of these viral glycoproteins. Confocal microscopy data demonstrate that MARCH8 traps the viral glycoproteins in an intracellular compartment. We observe that the endogenous expression of MARCH8 in several relevant human cell types is rapidly inducible by type I interferon. These results help to inform the mechanism by which MARCH proteins exert their antiviral activity and provide insights into the role of cellular inhibitory factors in antagonizing the biogenesis, trafficking, and virion incorporation of viral glycoproteins.IMPORTANCE Viral envelope glycoproteins are an important structural component on the surfaces of enveloped viruses that direct virus binding and entry and also serve as targets for the host adaptive immune response. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of action of the MARCH family of cellular proteins that disrupt the trafficking and virion incorporation of viral glycoproteins across several virus families. This research provides novel insights into how host cell factors antagonize viral replication, perhaps opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention in the replication of a diverse group of highly pathogenic enveloped viruses.","Lun, Cheng Man; Waheed, Abdul A; Majadly, Ahlam; Powell, Nicole; Freed, Eric O",mBio (Online),500,26

METHODS: We used linked health data from hospitalisation, mortality records and primary care consultations to follow-up 563,151 Welsh residents from their 60 th birthday to estimate dementia rate and associated risk factors. Dementia, epilepsy and covariates (medication, smoking, comorbidities) were classified using previously validated code lists. We studied rate of dementia and dementia subtypes in people with epilepsy (PWE) and without using (stratified) Kaplan-Meier plots and flexible parametric survival models. RESULTS: PWE had a 2.5 (95% CI 2.3 to 2.6) times higher hazard of incident dementia, a 1.6 (95% CI 1.4 to 1.8) times higher hazard of incident Alzheimers disease (AD), and a 3.1 (95% CI 2.8 to 3.4) times higher hazard of incident Vascular dementia (VaD). A history of stroke modified the increased incidence in PWE. PWE who were first diagnosed at age 25 years or younger had a similar dementia rate compared to those diagnosed later in life.

HYPOTHESIS: COVID-19 infection may result in cardiovascular manifestations leading to worse clinical outcome. METHODS: Fifty four severe and critical patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. Risk factors predicting the severity of COVID-19 were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 54 patients (56.1 ± 13.5 years old, 66.7% male) with COVID-19, 39 were diagnosed as severe and 15 as critical cases. The occurrence of diabetes, the level of D-dimer, inflammatory and cardiac markers in critical cases were significantly higher. Troponin I (TnI) elevation occurred in 42.6% of all the severe and critical patients. Three patients experienced hypotension at admission and were all diagnosed as critical cases consequently. Hypotension was found in one severe case and seven critical cases during hospitalization. Sinus tachycardia is the most common type of arrythmia and was observed in 23 severe patients and all the critical patients. Atrioventricular block and ventricular tachycardia were observed in critical patients at end stage while bradycardia and atrial fibrillation were less common. Mild pericardial effusion was observed in one severe case and five critical cases. Three critical cases suffered new onset of heart failure. Hypotension during treatment, severe myocardial injury and pericardial effusion were independent risk factors predicting the critical status of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: This study has systemically observed the impact of COVID-19 on cardiovascular system, including myocardial injury, blood pressure, arrythmia and cardiac function in severe and critical cases. Monitoring of vital signs and cardiac function of COVID-19 patients and applying potential interventions especially for those with hypotension during treatment, severe myocardial injury or pericardial effusion, is of vital importance.","Chen, Qingxing; Xu, Lili; Dai, Yongbin; Ling, Yunlong; Mao, Jiahao; Qian, Juying; Zhu, Wenqing; Di, Wencheng; Ge, Junbo",Clin Cardiol,500,5

This study proposes a fully automatic technique to design a face specific mask. Through the use of stereophotogrammetry, computer-assisted design and three-dimensional (3D) printing, we describe a protocol for manufacturing facemasks perfectly adapted to the individual face characteristics. The face specific mask was compared to a universal design of facemask and different filter container's designs were merged with the mask body. Subjective assessment of the face specific mask demonstrated tight closure at the nose, mouth and chin area, and permits the normal wearing of glasses. A screw-drive locking system is advised for easy assembly of the filter components. Automation of the process enables high volume production but still allows sufficient designer interaction to answer specific requirements. The suggested protocol can be used to provide more comfortable, effective and sustainable solution compared to a single use, standardized mask. Subsequent research on printing materials, sterilization technique and compliance with international regulations will facilitate the introduction of the face specific mask in clinical practice as well as for general use.","Shaheen, Eman; Willaert, Robin; Miclotte, Isabel; Coropciuc, Ruxandra; Bila, Michel; Politis, Constantinus",PLoS One,500,1

Our main modification is to use the Gillespie algorithm with a reaction time t max, exponentially distributed with mean inversely proportional to the node population in order to model the individuals' interactions. Our simulation results of the modified model on Barabasi-Albert networks are compatible with a continuous absorbing-active phase transition when increasing the average concentration. The transition obeys the mean-field critical exponents β = 1, γ′ = 0 and ν ⊥ = 1/2. In addition, the system presents logarithmic corrections with pseudo-exponents on the order parameter and its fluctuations, respectively.

We evaluated the association of BCG vaccination on morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV2, adjusted for country-specific responses to the epidemic, demographics and health. SARS-CoV2 cases and deaths as reported by 31 May 2020 in the World Health Organization situation reports were used. Countries with at least 28 days following the first 100 cases, and available information on BCG were included. We used log-linear regression models to explore associations of cases and deaths with the BCG vaccination policy in each country, adjusted for population size, gross domestic product, proportion aged over 65 years, stringency level measures, testing levels, smoking proportion, and the time difference from date of reporting the 100th case to 31 May 2020. We further looked at the association that might have been found if the analyses were done at earlier time points. The study included 97 countries with 73 having a policy of current BCG vaccination, 13 having previously had BCG vaccination, and 11 having never had BCG vaccination. In a log-linear regression model there was no effect of country-level BCG status on SARS-CoV2 cases or deaths. Univariable log-linear regression models showed a trend towards a weakening of the association over time. We found no statistical evidence for an association between BCG vaccination policy and either SARS-CoV2 morbidity or mortality. We urge countries to rather consider alternative tools with evidence supporting their effectiveness for controlling SARS-CoV2 morbidity and mortality.","Chimoyi, Lucy; Velen, Kavindhran; Churchyard, Gavin J; Wallis, Robert; Lewis, James J; Charalambous, Salome",PLoS One,500,24

However, in light of the pandemic, schools require customized schedules that can address the health concerns and safety of the students considering classroom sizes, air conditioning equipment, classroom systems, e.g., self-contained or compartmentalized. To solve this issue, we developed the School-Virus-Infection-Simulator (SVIS) for teachers and education policymakers. SVIS simulates the spread of infection at a school considering the students' lesson schedules, classroom volume, air circulation rates in classrooms, and infectability of the students. Thus, teachers and education policymakers can simulate how their school schedules can impact current health concerns. We then demonstrate the impact of several school schedules in self-contained and departmentalized classrooms and evaluate them in terms of the maximum number of students infected simultaneously and the percentage of face-to-face lessons. The results show that increasing classroom ventilation rate is effective, however, the impact is not stable compared to customizing school schedules, in addition, school schedules can differently impact the maximum number of students infected depending on whether classrooms are self-contained or compartmentalized. It was found that one of school schedules had a higher maximum number of students infected, compared to schedules with a higher percentage of face-to-face lessons. SVIS and the simulation results can help teachers and education policymakers plan school schedules appropriately in order to reduce the maximum number of students infected, while also maintaining a certain percentage of face-to-face lessons.","Takahashi, Satoshi; Kitazawa, Masaki; Yoshikawa, Atsushi",,500,5

A new research direction is attracting a significant amount of attention in the academic community of environmental sciences and engineering, in which rapid community-level monitoring could be achieved by applying the methodology of wastewater based epidemiology (WBE). Given the fact that the development of a mass balance on the total number of viral RNA copies in wastewater samples and the infected stool specimens is the heart of WBE, the result of the quantitative RNA detection in wastewater has to be highly sensitive, accurate, and reliable. Thus, applying effective concentration methods before the subsequent RNA extraction and RT-qPCR detection is a must-have procedure for the WBE. This review provides new insights into the primary concentration methods that have been adopted by the eighteen recently reported COVID-19 wastewater detection studies, along with a brief discussion of the mechanisms of the most commonly used virus concentration methods, including the PEG-based separation, electrostatically charged membrane filtration, and ultrafiltration. In the end, two easy and well-proven concentration strategies are recommended as below, aiming to maximize the practical significance and operational effectiveness of the SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration from wastewater samples.","Lu, Dingnan; Huang, Zhuangrong; Luo, Jiayue; Zhang, Xiaoqi; Sha, Sha",Sci Total Environ,500,13

The first macrodomain, Mac1, is conserved throughout CoVs, and binds to and hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) from target proteins. Mac1 likely counters host-mediated anti-viral ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification that is part of the host response to viral infections. Mac1 is essential for pathogenesis in multiple animal models of CoV infection, implicating it as a virulence factor and potential therapeutic target. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 exhibit similar structural folds and all 3 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with low µM affinities. Importantly, using ADP-ribose detecting binding reagents in both a gel-based assay and novel ELISA assays, we demonstrated de-MARylating activity for all 3 CoV Mac1 proteins, with the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein leading to a more rapid loss of substrate compared to the others. In addition, none of these enzymes could hydrolyze poly-ADP-ribose. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV Mac1 proteins are MAR-hydrolases with similar functions, indicating that compounds targeting CoV Mac1 proteins may have broad anti-CoV activity.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged into the human population and has led to a worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 that has caused greater than 1.2 million deaths worldwide. With, no currently approved treatments, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. All coronaviruses encode for a highly conserved macrodomain (Mac1) that binds to and removes ADP-ribose adducts from proteins in a dynamic post-translational process increasingly recognized as an important factor that regulates viral infection. The macrodomain is essential for CoV pathogenesis and may be a novel therapeutic target. Thus, understanding its biochemistry and enzyme activity are critical first steps for these efforts. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose, and describe its ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis activities in direct comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins. These results are an important first step for the design and testing of potential therapies targeting this unique protein domain.","Alhammad, Yousef M O; Kashipathy, Maithri M; Roy, Anuradha; Gagné, Jean-Philippe; McDonald, Peter; Gao, Philip; Nonfoux, Louis; Battaile, Kevin P; Johnson, David K; Holmstrom, Erik D; Poirier, Guy G; Lovell, Scott; Fehr, Anthony R",J. virol,500,29

AIM: The objective of this review was to synthesize existing data on the effectiveness and safety of using chemical disinfectants to decontaminate N95 FFRs. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted on disinfectants to decontaminate N95 FFRs using Embase, Medline, Global Health, Google Scholar, WHO feed, and MedRxiv. Two reviewers independently determined study eligibility and extracted predefined data fields. Original research reporting on N95 FFR function, decontamination, safety, or FFR fit following decontamination with a disinfectant was included. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION: A single cycle of vaporized hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) successfully removes viral pathogens without affecting airflow resistance or fit, and maintains an initial filter penetration of <5%, with little change in FFR appearance. Residual hydrogen peroxide levels following decontamination were within safe limits. More than one decontamination cycle of vaporized H2O2 may be possible but further information is required on how multiple cycles would affect FFR fit in a real-world setting before the upper limit can be established. Although immersion in liquid H2O2 does not appear to adversely affect FFR function, there is no available data on its ability to remove infectious pathogens from FFRs or its impact on FFR fit. Sodium hypochlorite, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and ethylene oxide are not recommended due to safety concerns or negative effects on FFR function.","O039,; Hearn, K; Gertsman, S; Webster, R; Tsampalieros, A; Ng, R; Gibson, J; Sampson, M; Sikora, L; McNally, J D",J Hosp Infect,500,4

This has important implications for the risk of patient-to-staff, staff-to-staff and staff-to-patient transmission among health professionals in maternity units. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of previously undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection in health professionals from two tertiary-level maternity units in London, UK, and to determine associations between healthcare workers' characteristics, reported symptoms and serological evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 200 anaesthetists, midwives and obstetricians, with no previously confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, were tested for immune seroconversion using laboratory IgG assays. Comprehensive symptom and medical histories were also collected. Five out of 40 (12.5%; 95%CI 4.2-26.8%) anaesthetists, 7/52 (13.5%; 95%CI 5.6-25.8%) obstetricians and 17/108 (15.7%; 95%CI 9.5-24.0%) midwives were seropositive, with an overall total of 29/200 (14.5%; 95%CI 9.9-20.1%) of maternity healthcare workers testing positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Of those who had seroconverted, 10/29 (35.5%) were completely asymptomatic. Fever or cough were only present in 6/29 (21%) and 10/29 (35%) respectively. Anosmia was the most common symptom occurring in 15/29 (52%) seropositive participants and was the only symptom that was predictive of positive seroconversion (OR 18; 95%CI 6-55). Of those who were seropositive, 59% had not self-isolated at any point and continued to provide patient care in the hospital setting. This is the largest study of baseline immune seroconversion in maternity healthcare workers conducted to date and reveals that one out of six were seropositive, of whom one out of three were asymptomatic. This has significant implications for the risk of occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for both staff and patients in maternity units. Regular testing of staff, including asymptomatic staff should be considered to reduce transmission risk.","Bampoe, S; Lucas, D N; Neall, G; Sceales, P; Aggarwal, R; Caulfield, K; Siassakos, D; Odor, P M",Anaesthesia,500,20

Several epidemiological studies suggested cross-protection between influenza vaccination and COVID-19. In a large academic Dutch hospital, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was less common among employees who had received a previous influenza vaccination: relative risk reductions of 37% and 49% were observed following influenza vaccination during the first and second COVID-19 waves, respectively. The quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine induced a trained immunity program that boosted innate immune responses against various viral stimuli and fine-tuned the anti-SARS-CoV-2 response, which may result in better protection against COVID-19. Influenza vaccination led to transcriptional reprogramming of monocytes and reduced systemic inflammation. These epidemiological and immunological data argue for potential benefits of influenza vaccination against COVID-19, and future randomized trials are warranted to test this possibility.","Debisarun, Priya A.; Gössling, Katharina L.; Bulut, Ozlem; Kilic, Gizem; Zoodsma, Martijn; Liu, Zhaoli; Oldenburg, Marina; Rüchel, Nadine; Zhang, Bowen; Xu, Cheng-Jian; Struycken, Patrick; Koeken, Valerie A.C.M.; Domínguez-Andrés, Jorge; Moorlag, Simone J.C.F.M.; Taks, Esther; Ostermann, Philipp N.; Müller, Lisa; Schaal, Heiner; Adams, Ortwin; Borkhardt, Arndt; Oever, Jaap ten; Crevel, Reinout van; Li, Yang; Netea, Mihai",,500,21

We determined the levels of inflammatory cytokines in patients with COVID-19 and their relationships with ARDS and extrapulmonary MOD. METHODS: The clinical and laboratory data of 94 COVID-19 patients with and without ARDS were analyzed. The levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor &#945; [TNF-&#945;]) were measured on days 1, 3, and 5 following admission. Seventeen healthy volunteers were recruited as controls. Correlations in the levels of inflammatory cytokines with clinical and laboratory variables were analyzed, furthermore, we also explored the relationships of different cytokines with ARDS and extrapulmonary MOD. RESULTS: The ARDS group had higher serum levels of all 4 inflammatory cytokines than the controls, and these levels steadily increased after admission. The ARDS group also had higher levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 than the non-ARDS group, and the levels of these cytokines correlated significantly with coagulation parameters and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The levels of IL-6 and TNF-&#945; correlated with the levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen, and were also higher in ARDS patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). All 4 inflammatory cytokines had negative correlations with PaO2/FiO2. IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-&#945; had positive correlations with the APACHE-II score. Relative to survivors, non-survivors had higher levels of IL-6 and IL-10 at admission, and increasing levels over time. CONCLUSIONS: The cytokine storm apparently contributed to the development of ARDS and extrapulmonary MOD in COVID-19 patients. The levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 correlated with DIC, and the levels of IL-6 and TNF-&#945; were associated with AKI. Relative to survivors, patients who died within 28 days had increased levels of IL-6 and IL-10.","Wang, Jiajia; Yang, Xinjing; Li, Yongsheng; Huang, Jian-An; Jiang, Junhong; Su, Nan",Virol J,500,20

We present a retrospective cohort study of cEEG monitoring in COVID-19 patients to better explore this knowledge gap. METHODS: Among 22 COVID-19 patients, 19 underwent cEEGs, and 3 underwent routine EEGs (<1 h). Demographic and clinical variables, including comorbid conditions, discharge disposition, survival and cEEG findings, were collected. RESULTS: cEEG was performed for evaluation of altered mental status (n = 17) or seizure-like events (n = 5). Five patients, including 2 with epilepsy, had epileptiform abnormalities on cEEG. Two patients had electrographic seizures without a prior epilepsy history. There were no acute neuroimaging findings. Periodic discharges were noted in one-third of patients and encephalopathic EEG findings were not associated with IV anesthetic use. CONCLUSIONS: Interictal epileptiform abnormalities in the absence of prior epilepsy history were rare. However, the discovery of asymptomatic seizures in two of twenty-two patients was higher than previously reported and is therefore of concern. SIGNIFICANCE: cEEG monitoring in COVID-19 patients may aid in better understanding an epileptogenic potential of SARS-CoV2 infection. Nevertheless, larger studies utilizing cEEG are required to better examine acute epileptic risk in COVID-19 patients.","Louis, Shreya; Dhawan, Andrew; Newey, Christopher; Nair, Dileep; Jehi, Lara; Hantus, Stephen; Punia, Vineet",Clin Neurophysiol,500,16

During the COVID-19 pandemic, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech-language therapists and their patients experienced restrictions regarding the usual face-to-face therapy. Teletherapy has become a highly discussed medium for providing therapy services. This study aimed at assessing Austrian therapists' attitudes towards teletherapy, including perceived barriers, during and before the COVID-19 lockdown. Further interest referred to therapists' technical affinity and experiences with the application of teletherapy. METHODS: Therapists (n = 325) completed an online survey amid the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. Retrospective indications referred to the time prior to the lockdown. Ratings were opposed across the three therapeutic professions. Subgroup analyses investigated the role of gender and age regarding technical affinity. Measures included custom-made attitudinal statements towards teletherapy and the standardized TA-EG survey. RESULTS: The COVID-19 lockdown caused attitude changes towards teletherapy - for example, in terms of interest (r = 0.57, p > 0.01), perceived skills for performance of teletherapy (r = 0.33, p > 0.01) and perceived need for physical contact with patients (r = 0.35, p > 0.01). Regarding technical affinity, women reported significantly higher values than men did (r = 0.32, p > 0.01). Nearly half of the participants already applied teletherapy, with mainly positive ratings regarding perceived skills and feasibility. Barriers identified were missing or unstable reimbursement policies by insurance companies and therapeutic software with guaranteed data security. DISCUSSION: Austrian therapists indicate a relatively high level of telehealth positivity, with an improvement in the course of the COVID-19 lockdown.

However, the titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies varied in each individual, and the precise factors that might govern such variation have not been elucidated. Objectives: To assess the factors associated with high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody among COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Saiful Anwar General Hospital, Malang, Indonesia. Information of interest including demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory findings, and the titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody among COVID-19 CCP donors were collected. The correlation was assessed using multiple logistic regression. Results: A total of 50 COVID-19 CCP donors with the titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody of more than 1:320 and 33 donors with the titers of less than 1:320 were analyzed. Our analysis revealed that CCP donors with history of cough, fever, dyspnea, and pneumonia significantly had higher titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody compared to asymptomatic donors. Moreover, CCP donors with elevated levels of eosinophils and immature granulocytes and low levels of albumins had higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. The titer of antibody was not affected by comorbidities of donors. Conclusions: CPP donors who had experience of symptomatic COVID-19 with high eosinophils level, high immature granulocytes and low albumin level have higher titers of anti-SARS-COV-2 antibody than those who experienced asymptomatic COVID-19. Our current findings may be used as the additional baseline criteria for selecting the donors of CCP for the management of COVID-19.","Wardhani, Shinta Oktya; Fajar, Jonny Karunia; Nurarifah, Nina; Hermanto, Djoko Heri; Fatonah, Siti; Djajalaksana, Susanthy; Fatoni, Arie Zainul; Arsana, Putu Moda; Wulandari, Laksmi; Soegiarto, Gatot; Dhama, Kuldeep; Harapan, Harapan",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,500,21

We tested integration of inhibitory synaptic inputs onto SNc neurons from genetically defined populations in dorsal striatum (striosome and matrix) and external globus pallidus (GPe; parvalbumin- and Lhx6-positive), and examined their contribution to pause-rebound firing. Activation of striosome projections, which target ""dendron bouquets"" in the pars reticulata (SNr), consistently quiets firing and relief from striosome inhibition triggers rebound activity. Striosomal inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) display a prominent GABA-B receptor-mediated component that strengthens the impact of SNr dendrite synapses on somatic excitability and enables rebounding. By contrast, GPe projections activate GABA-A receptors on the soma and proximal dendrites but do not result in rebounding. Lastly, optical mapping shows that dorsal striatum selectively inhibits the ventral population of SNc neurons, which are intrinsically capable of rebounding. Therefore, we define a distinct striatonigral circuit for generating dopamine rebound.","Evans, Rebekah C; Twedell, Emily L; Zhu, Manhua; Ascencio, Jefferson; Zhang, Renshu; Khaliq, Zayd M",Cell Rep,500,1

Glucocorticoid use has been in debate for treating COVID-19-infected patient. Methods Twenty-nine critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this report are defined as patients are intubated and admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). Chart review was conducted on those patients, their demographic characteristics, baseline comorbidities, hospital course, clinical management, and laboratory/imagine reports were summarized. Thirty-day survival probability after ICU admission was analyzed for comparing the steroid group and nonsteroid group. Survival curve and analysis were performed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. P value less than 0.05 is defined as significant different. Results Among the 29 critical COVID-19 cases, 12 are survived beyond day 30 of ICU admission, 9 of the 12 are successfully extubated and discharged home, 3 remained on ventilator support in ICU after 30 days. In the 12 survived patients, 10 (83%) received glucocorticoid treatment, whereas in the 17 patients who died, only 8 (44%) were treated with steroid. The baseline characteristics between the steroid and nonsteroid group are similar. The 30-day survival rate is lower in the steroid group comparing to the nonsteroid group (P = 0.0405). Conclusions Proper use of glucocorticoids offers considerable mortality benefit to the outcome of critical ill COVID-19 patient. This observational descriptive study might be helpful to other similar small community hospital facing a surge of COVID-19 patients, when other clinical trials or supports are hardly available.","Wang, T.; Guerra, A.

These findings raise the question of the role of cell factors associated with early stages of the viral infection in host selectivity. The cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE2). Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been shown to prime the viral spike for its interaction with its receptor. GRP78 has also been proposed as a possible co-receptor. In this study, we used several bioinformatics approaches to bring clues in the interaction of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and GRP78 with SARS-CoV-2. We selected several mammalian hosts that could play a key role in viral spread by acting as secondary hosts (cats, dogs, pigs, mice, and ferrets) and evaluated their predicted permissiveness by in silico analysis. Results showed that ionic pairs (salt bridges, N-O pair, and long-range interactions) produced between ACE2 and the viral spike has an essential function in the host interaction. On the other hand, TMPRSS2 and GRP78 are proteins with high homology in all the evaluated hosts. Thus, these proteins do not seem to play a role in host selectivity, suggesting that other factors may play a role in the non-permissivity in some of these hosts. These proteins represent however interesting cell targets that could be explored in order to control the virus replication in humans and in the intermediary hosts.","Rangel, H R; Ortega, J T; Maksoud, S; Pujol, F H; Serrano, M L",Virus Res,500,1

COVID-19 is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of the study is to contribute to the surveillance of the pandemic by bringing new knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers. It seeks to evaluate whether certain job functions are associated with a higher risk of being infected and to clarify if such association is mediated by the number of individuals that employees meet during a workday. In addition, we investigate regional and national differences in seroprevalence. METHODS: This research involved a bi-national prospective observational cohort study including 3272 adults employed at Falck in Sweden and Denmark. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies every second week for a period of 8 weeks from 22 June 2020 until 10 August 2020. Descriptive statistics as well as multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied. RESULTS: Of the 3272 Falck employees participating in this study, 159 (4.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was lower among Danish Falck employees than among those from Sweden (2.8% in Denmark and 8.3% in Sweden). We also found that the number of customer or patient contacts during a workday was the most prominent predictor for seropositivity and that ambulance staff was the most vulnerable staff group. CONCLUSION: Our study presents geographical variations in seroprevalence within the Falck organization and shows evidence that social interaction is one of the biggest risk factors for becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Laursen, Jannie; Petersen, Janne; Didriksen, Maria; Iversen, Kasper; Ullum, Henrik",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),500,22

Initial assumptions against a laboratory origin, by contrast, have remained unsubstantiated. Furthermore, over a year after the initial outbreak in Wuhan, there is still no clear evidence of zoonotic transfer from a bat or intermediate species.

Based on bariatric surgery data in humans it has been suggested that the gut-brain axis is also involved in this process, however the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. DESIGN: We therefore compared the effect of fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) donors versus oral butyrate supplementation on (123I-FP-CIT determined) brain dopamine transporter (DAT) and serotonin transporter (SERT) binding as well as stable isotope determined insulin sensitivity at baseline and after 4 weeks in 24 male and female treatment-naïve metabolic syndrome subjects. Also, plasma metabolites and fecal microbiota were determined at these timepoints. RESULTS: We observed an increase in brain DAT upon donor FMT compared to oral butyrate that reduced this binding. However, no effect on body weight and insulin sensitivity was seen upon post-RYGB donor feces transfer in either humans with metabolic syndrome. In line, increases in fecal levels of Bacteroides uniformis were significantly associated with an increase in DAT whereas increases in Prevotella spp. showed an inverse association. Furthermore, changes in the plasma metabolites glycine, betaine, methionine and lysine (associated with the S-adenosylmethionine cycle) were also associated with altered striatal DAT expression. CONCLUSION: Although more and larger studies are needed, our data suggest a potential gut microbiota-driven modulation of brain dopamine and serotonin transporters in human obese metabolic syndrome subjects.

At the healthcare level there is the risk that nosocomial outbreaks can be local amplifiers. Adequate infection control practices are of critical importance, which include proper use of personal protective equipment. This equipment must be appropriate to the pathogen transmission route that, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, occurs through droplet and contact routes. The infected individual, when talking, coughing or sneezing, spreads droplets containing the virus, directly contaminating other individuals within one to two meters of distance, as well as the surrounding environment. Airborne transmission may occur when aerosol-generating procedures are performed. Concerning respiratory protection, there is currently weak evidence that the use of respirators provides better protection than surgical masks for SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses (with the exception of aerosol-generating procedures, in which case the use of a respirator is recommended). Eye protection should be guaranteed whenever there is a risk of splashes, droplets or aerosols. The use of different, or higher than necessary, level of personal protective equipment, for the transmission route of the agent, is a form of misuse and can affect its supply for situations when it is clearly indicated.

Given the novelty and scale of the disease, information surrounding COVID-19 has been marked by considerable uncertainty and confusion. Although various factors have been associated with COVID-19 distress, little is known about the relations between levels of intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and anxiety symptoms and behaviors. This cross-sectional study sought to examine potential correlates and pathways between anxiety and precautionary behaviors with the two levels of IU: prospective and inhibitory. Individuals from NYC (N = 99) completed an online survey through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Findings revealed that fear of COVID-19 accounts for associations between prospective IU and greater anxiety symptoms and behaviors, whereas precaution adherence accounts for associations between prospective IU and reduced anxiety symptoms and behaviors. In addition, precaution adherence accounts for associations between inhibitory IU and greater anxiety symptoms and behaviors. The results shed light on ways in which variations in IU may be associated with anxiety symptoms and behaviors in the context of COVID-19 and future pandemic scenarios.","Jiwani, Zishan; Cadwell, Olivia G; Parnes, McKenna; Brown, Adam D",J Nerv Ment Dis,500,16

Though a number of vaccines have recently been approved against the virus, availability remains a big challenge, and also acceptance by most people has become a big debate. This review discusses possible/ proposed natural product remedies and some major conventional treatment options used to manage the infection and, safety concerns on the use of unproven or unapproved health products against COVID-19. An extensive literature review indicated that the influx of unproven and unapproved health products in the global market are on the rise, leading to various forms of self- medication. To this effect, there have been warnings by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organisation against the use of such products. Conventional drugs such as remdesivir, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and dexamethasone are the major proposed drugs that are currently undergoing clinical trials for the management of this disease. Efforts are being made globally in the search for possible therapeutics which may be the best way to eradicating this disease. Some countries have approved the use of natural products in the management of COVID-19, despite little or no clinical evidence on their efficacy and safety. Natural products may hold a great potential in the fight against COVID-19 but without detailed clinical trials, their potency against the virus and their safe use cannot be established. To attain this goal, extensive research followed by clinical studies are needed. Collaborative efforts between researchers, clinicians, governments and traditional medicinal practitioners in the search and development of safe and effective therapeutics from natural products for the treatment of COVID-19 could be a potential option.","Omokhua-Uyi, Aitebiremen Gift; Van Staden, Johannes",,500,24

Earlier studies have shown that the prevalence of this inappropriate treatment ranges from 45% to 83%. Multifaceted interventions based on international guidelines and antimicrobial stewardship can decrease overtreatment of ASB. We have designed a study protocol with the main objective of reducing overtreatment of ASB by 50% through use of a deimplementation strategy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use a stepped-wedge cluster randomised design, comparing outcomes before and after introduction of our intervention in the emergency department (ED) of five hospitals (clusters) in the Netherlands. All patients (&#8805;18 years old) who have a urine test performed in the ED will be screened for eligibility. The deimplementation strategy consists of a combination of interventions, including education, audit and feedback. The primary endpoint is overtreatment of ASB in patients without risk factors (eg, pregnancy, planned invasive urological procedures and neutropenia). Secondary endpoints are the duration of antimicrobial treatment for ASB, the number of urine cultures and urinalysis per 1000 patients, and overtreatment of positive urinalysis in asymptomatic patients. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the medical ethics research committee of the Academic Medical Centre (Amsterdam, the Netherlands) with a waiver for informed consent. Local feasibility was obtained by the local institutional review boards of all participating hospitals. Our study aims to reduce inappropriate screening and treatment of ASB in EDs, improve healthcare quality, lower the increase in antimicrobial resistance and save costs. If proven (cost)-effective, this study provides a well-suited strategy for a nationwide approach to reduce overtreatment of ASB. Relevant results of our study will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at relevant (scientific) conferences.

Several epidemiology models require simulation-based inference such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to fit their parameters to observations. ABC inference is highly amenable to efficient hardware acceleration. In this work, we develop parallel ABC inference of a stochastic epidemiology model for COVID-19. The statistical inference framework is implemented and compared on Intel Xeon CPU, NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU and the Graphcore Mk1 IPU, and the results are discussed in the context of their computational architectures. Results show that GPUs are 4x and IPUs are 30x faster than Xeon CPUs. Extensive performance analysis indicates that the difference between IPU and GPU can be attributed to higher communication bandwidth, closeness of memory to compute, and higher compute power in the IPU. The proposed framework scales across 16 IPUs, with scaling overhead not exceeding 8% for the experiments performed. We present an example of our framework in practice, performing inference on the epidemiology model across three countries, and giving a brief overview of the results.","Kulkarni, Sourabh; Krell, Mario Michael; Nabarro, Seth; Moritz, Csaba Andras",,500,23

The ICPs used in this work were comprised of two components, i.e. a supramolecular Ln-ICP host formed by the coordination between the GMP ligand and central metal ion Tb3+, and guest GQDs with abundant functional groups, which were utilized as antenna ligands to further sensitize the fluorescence of Tb/GMP. Upon excitation at 300 nm, the obtained GQD@Tb/GMP ICP nanoparticles exhibited enhanced green fluorescence from Tb/GMP. With the addition of Cu2+, the competitive coordination between Cu2+ and GQDs weakened the antenna effect, leading to a decrease in the fluorescence of GQD@Tb/GMP ICPs. However, in the presence of thiocholine (TCh), a thiol-containing compound hydrolyzed from acetylthiocholine (ATCh) by AChE, a stronger coordination interaction between Cu2+ and TCh occurred, resulting in the restoration of the fluorescence of GQD@Tb/GMP ICPs. Using the method established herein, the cerebrospinal AChE fluctuation of rats with acute organophosphorus pesticide (OP) poisoning or chronic Alzheimer's disease (AD) could be monitored. This study essentially provides a novel approach to realize the direct monitoring of a biomarker for brain dysfunction by regulating the competitive coordination interaction reversibly, which is critical in the early diagnosis and therapy of brain diseases.","Liu, Chang; Huang, Chunyu; Ma, Ruixue; Zhai, Wanying; Deng, Jingjing; Zhou, Tianshu",Analyst,500,16

Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is a recently discovered human coronavirus found to cause respiratory illness in children and adults that is distinct from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and human coronaviruses 229E (HCoV-229E) and OC43 (HCoV-OC43). Methods. We investigated the role that HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E played in children hospitalized with fever and acute respiratory symptoms in Hong Kong during the period from August 2001 through August 2002. Results. Coronavirus infections were detected in 26 (4.4%) of 587 children studied; 15 (2.6%) were positive for HCoV-NL63, 9 (1.5%) were positive for HCoV-OC43, and 2 (0.3%) were positive for HCoV-229E. In addition to causing upper respiratory disease, we found that HCoV-NL63 can present as croup, asthma exacerbation, febrile seizures, and high fever. The mean age (± standard deviation [SD]) of the infected children was 30.7 ± 19.8 months (range, 6–57 months). The mean maximum temperature (±SD) for the 12 children who were febrile was 39.3°C ± 0.9°C, and the mean total duration of fever (±SD) for all children was 2.6 ± 1.2 days (range, 1–5 days). HCoV-NL63 infections were noted in the spring and summer months of 2002, whereas HCoV-OC43 infection mainly occurred in the fall and winter months of 2001. HCoV-NL63 viruses appeared to cluster into 2 evolutionary lineages, and viruses from both lineages cocirculated in the same season. Conclusions. HCoV-NL63 is a significant pathogen that contributes to the hospitalization of children, and it was estimated to have caused 224 hospital admissions per 100,000 population aged ⩽6 years each year in Hong Kong.","Chiu, Susan S.; Hung Chan, Kwok; Wing Chu, Ka; Kwan, See Wai; Guan, Yi; Man Poon, Leo Lit; Peiris, J.

This study aims to estimate the risk of disease progression of patients who have been confirmed with COVID-19. Methods: Meta-analysis was performed in existing literatures to identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 pneumonia progression. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to hospitals in Wuhan or Hangzhou were retrospectively enrolled. The risk prediction model and nomogram were developed from Wuhan cohort through logistic regression algorithm, and then validated in Hangzhou and Yinchuan cohorts. Results: A total of 270 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 30, 2019, and Mar 30, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled (Table 1). The development cohort (Wuhan cohort) included 87 (43%) men and 115 (57%) women, and the median age was 53 years old. Hangzhou validation cohort included 20 (48%) men and 22 (52%) women, and the median age was 59 years old. Yinchuan validation cohort included 12 (46%) men and 14 (54%) women, and the median age was 44 years old. The meta-analysis along with univariate logistic analysis in development cohort have shown that age, fever, diabetes, hypertension, CREA, BUN, CK, LDH, and neutrophil count were significantly associated with disease progression of COVID-19 pneumonia. The model and nomogram derived from development cohort show good performance in both development and validation cohorts. Conclusion: The severe COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with various types of risk factors including age, fever, comorbidities, and some laboratory examination indexes. The model integrated with these factors can help to evaluate the disease progression of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Cao, Guodong; Li, Pengping; Chen, Yuanyuan; Fang, Kun; Chen, Bo; Wang, Shuyue; Feng, Xudong; Wang, Zhenyu; Xiong, Maoming; Zheng, Ruiying; Guo, Mengzhe; Sun, Qiang",Front Med (Lausanne),500,20

Saliva droplets or aerosols expelled by sneezing, coughing, breathing, and talking may carry this virus. People in close distance may be exposed directly to these droplets or indirectly when touching the droplets that fall on surrounding surfaces and ending up contracting COVID-19 after touching the mucosa tissue of their faces. It is of great interest to quickly and effectively detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in an environment, but the existing methods only work in laboratory settings, to the best of our knowledge. However, it may be possible to detect the presence of saliva in the environment and proceed with prevention measures. However, detecting saliva itself has not been documented in the literature. On the other hand, many sensors that detect different organic components in saliva to monitor a person’s health and diagnose different diseases, ranging from diabetes to dental health, have been proposed and they may be used to detect the presence of saliva. This paper surveys sensors that detect organic and inorganic components of human saliva. Humidity sensors are also considered in the detection of saliva because a large portion of saliva is water. Moreover, sensors that detect infectious viruses are also included as they may also be embedded into saliva sensors for a confirmation of the presence of the virus. A classification of sensors by their working principles and the substances they detect is presented, including the sensors’ specifications, sample size, and sensitivity. Indications of which sensors are portable and suitable for field application are presented. This paper also discusses future research and challenges that must be resolved to realize practical saliva sensors. Such sensors may help minimize the spread of not only COVID-19 but also other infectious diseases.","Dave, Priya Kishor; Rojas-Cessa, Roberto; Dong, Ziqian; Umpaichitra, Vatcharapan",Biosensors (Basel),500,1

Current interventions on RTW lack evidence regarding effectiveness, while interventions for work retention are missing. Partners of cancer survivors may also experience work- and health-related outcomes; yet, these consequences are not well understood. Here, the protocol of the STEPS study is described. The study aims are to: 1) evaluate the (cost-)effectiveness of a rehabilitation program for RTW and work retention in cancer survivors, and 2) assess health- and work-related outcomes among cancer survivors’ partners. METHODS: In a multicentre Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), 236 working-age cancer survivors with an employment contract will be randomly allocated to a usual care group or an intervention group receiving a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program, combining occupational therapy facilitating work retention (e.g., energy management and self-efficacy training) and reintegration consultation addressing work-related issues (e.g., RTW planning and discussing workplace or task modifications with the supervisor). Alongside the RCT, a prospective cohort study will be conducted among cancer survivors’ partners (n = 267). Participants in the RCT and cohort study will be asked to complete questionnaires at baseline, and after six and 12 months, assessing work- and health-related outcomes. Generalized estimating equations will be used to assess intervention’s effectiveness, compared to usual care, regarding primary (i.e., working hours per week) and secondary outcomes. Also economic and process evaluations will be performed. For the cohort study, logistic or linear regression modelling will be applied assessing work- and health-related outcomes (primary outcome: working hours) of cancer survivors’ partners, and what factors predict these outcomes. RESULTS: The study is planned to start in September 2021; results are expected in 2023. CONCLUSION: Compared to usual care, the STEPS intervention is hypothesized to be (cost-)effective and the intervention could be a valuable addition to standard care helping cancer survivors to sustain employment. Further, it is expected that living with a cancer survivor has a substantial impact on work and health of partners, while specific groups of partners that are at particular risk for this impact are likely to be identified.

This communication analyses how hospitalisations due to COVID-19 changed in the age groups 18–49 years and ≥70 years. Study design Longitudinal study based on secondary data. Methods Data from SIVEP-Gripe, a public and open-access database of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness records (including COVID-19 notifications), were used in this study. Statistical control charts examined changes in the magnitude and variation of younger (18–49 years) and older (≥70 years) adults who were hospitalised between 15 March 2020 and 19 June 2021. Results During the few first weeks of the pandemic in Brazil, the number of COVID-19 hospitalisations increased in older adults, but decreased in younger adults. Subsequently, hospitalisations reached statistical control zones in epidemiological weeks (EW) 19–48 of 2020 (EW 19-48/2020) and EW 03-05/2021 (18–49 y, mean = 26.1%; ≥70 y, mean = 32.8%). Between EW 49/2020 and EW 02/2021, the number of hospitalisations of younger adults dropped to levels below the lower control limit. In contrast, the number of hospitalisations of older adults surpassed the upper limit of the corresponding statistical control zones. However, from EW 06/2021, numbers of hospitalisations changed from statistical control zones, with hospitalisations of younger adults increasing and reaching 44.9% in EW 24/2021 and hospitalisations of older adults decreasing until EW 19/2021 (14.1%) and reaching 17.3% in EW 24/2021. Conclusions An increasing number of COVID-19 hospitalisations were observed in younger adults from EW 06/2021. This could be a result of the successful vaccination programme in older adults, who were initially prioritised, and possibly an increased exposure to highly transmissible variants of COVID-19 in younger adults who had to go to work in the absence of social protection (i.e. government financial support). Potential consequences of COVID-19 hospitalisations in younger adults could include a reduced life expectancy of the population and an increased number of people unable to perform daily activities due to post-COVID-19 conditions.","Guimarães, Raphael; Villela, Daniel Antunes Maciel; Xavier, Diego Ricardo; Saldanha, Raphael; Barcellos, Christovam; Machado de Freitas, Carlos; Portela, Margareth Crisóstomo",Public Health,500,20

However, because endogenous bovine immunoglobulin light chain loci are still intact, the light chains are produced both from the hIGK and hIGL genomic loci on the HAC and from the endogenous bovine kappa-chain (bIGK) and lambda-chain (bIGL) genomic loci, resulting in the production of fully hIgGs (both Ig heavy-chains and light-chains are of human origin: hIgG/hIgκ or hIgG/hIgλ) and chimeric hIgGs (Ig heavy-chains are of human origin while the Ig light-chains are of bovine origin: hIgG/bIgκ or hIgG/bIgλ).

Belonging to the betacoronavirus family, it primarily spreads through human contact via symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. Despite several attempts since it emerged, there is no known treatment in the form of drugs or vaccines. Hence, work on developing a potential multi-subunit vaccine is the need of the hour. In this study, attempts have been made to find globally conserved epitopes from the entire set of SARS-CoV-2 proteins as there is as yet, no clear information on the immunogenicity of these proteins. Using diverse computational tools, a ranked list of probable immunogenic, promiscuous epitopes generated through all the three main stages of antigen processing and presentation pathways has been prioritized. Moreover, several useful insights were gleaned during these analyses. One of the most important insights is that all of the proteins in this pathogen present unique epitopes, so that the targeting of a few specific viral proteins is not likely to result in an effective immune response in humans. Due to the presence of these unique epitopes in all of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, stronger immune responses generated by T cell hyperactivation may lead to cytokine storm and immunopathology and consequently, remote chances of human survival. These epitopes, after due validation in vitro, may thus need to be presented to the human body in that form of multi-subunit epitope-based vaccine that avoids such immunopathologies.","Mishra, Seema",R Soc Open Sci,500,24

Available data are often aggregated or lagged in availability, thus limiting insights into consumer behavior. Using household-level data from continuous consumer tracking in the Meat Demand Monitor project, we extend understanding of consumer behavior during the pandemic. This provides a timely example of the improved insights that follow from refined and ongoing data collection to generate valuable information. ABSTRACT: Meat products represent a significant share of US consumer food expenditures. The COVID-19 pandemic directly impacted both demand and supply of US beef and pork products for a prolonged period, resulting in a myriad of economic impacts. The complex disruptions create significant challenges in isolating and inferring consumer-demand changes from lagged secondary data. Thus, we turn to novel household-level data from a continuous consumer tracking survey, the Meat Demand Monitor, launched in February 2020, just before the US pandemic. We find diverse impacts across US households related to “hoarding” behavior and financial confidence over the course of the pandemic. Combined, these insights extend our understanding of pandemic impacts on US consumers and provide a timely example of knowledge enabled by ongoing and targeted household-level data collection and analysis.","Tonsor, Glynn T.; Lusk, Jayson L.; Tonsor, Shauna L.",Animals (Basel),500,16

Physical activity (PA) behaviors need to be examined to inform interventions and improve health. Responses to the C-EAT (COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time) survey (N = 720; age = 24.7 ± 2.0 yrs) were analyzed. This mixed-methods study quantitatively examined changes in self-reported PA (hours/week of mild PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), and total PA) from 2018 to 2020. Qualitative responses on how COVID-19 impacted PA were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Hours of PA were lower on average for all intensity levels during COVID-19 than in 2018 (p’s < 0.0001). Over half of the sample reported a decrease in MVPA (53.8%) and total PA (55.6%); 42.6% reported a decrease in mild PA. High SES were more likely to report an increase in total PA (p = 0.001) compared to those of lower SES. Most (83.6%) participants perceived that COVID-19 had influenced their PA. The most common explanations were decreased gym access, effects on outdoor PA, and increased dependence on at-home PA. Results suggest that emerging adults would benefit from behavioral interventions and health promotion efforts in response to the pandemic, with a focus on activities that can be easily performed in the home or in safe neighborhood spaces.","Folk, Amanda L.; Wagner, Brooke E.; Hahn, Samantha L.; Larson, Nicole; Barr-Anderson, Daheia J.; Neumark-Sztainer, Dianne",Int J Environ Res Public Health,500,1

This limits large-scale population testing and hinders the effort to identify and isolate infected individuals. OBJECTIVE: Herein, we developed and evaluated multi-stage group testing schemes that test samples in groups of various pool sizes in multiple stages. Through this approach, groups of negative samples can be eliminated with a single test, avoiding the need for individual testing and achieving considerable savings of resources. STUDY DESIGN: We designed and parameterized various multi-stage testing schemes and compared their efficiency at different prevalence rates using computer simulations. RESULTS: We found that three-stage testing schemes with pool sizes of maximum 16 samples can test up to three and seven times as many individuals with the same number of test kits for prevalence rates of around 5% and 1%, respectively. We propose an adaptive approach, where the optimal testing scheme is selected based on the expected prevalence rate. CONCLUSION: These group testing schemes could lead to a major reduction in the number of testing kits required and help improve large-scale population testing in general and in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Eberhardt, J.N.; Breuckmann, N.P.; Eberhardt, C.S.",J Clin Virol,500,26

METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, observational study was conducted across 11 hospitals. Pharmacist-intercepted prescribing errors were collected during inpatient order verification over 6 consecutive weeks utilizing a standardized documentation process. The potential harm of each error was evaluated using a modified National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC-MERP) index with physician validation, and errors were stratified into those with potentially low, serious, or life-threatening harm. Endpoints included the median error rate per 1,000 patient days, error type, and potential harm with correlating cost avoidance. RESULTS: Pharmacists intervened on 7,187 errors, resulting in a mean error rate of 39 errors per 1,000 patient days. Among the errors, 46.6% (n = 3,349) were determined to have potentially serious consequences and 2.4% (n = 175) could have been life-threatening if not intercepted. This equates to $874,000 in avoided cost.

Compared with never-smokers, current smokers had higher risks of hospitalisation (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.29) and mortality (smoking 1–9/day: OR 2.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 5.24; 10–19/day: OR 5.91, 95% CI 3.66 to 9.54; 20+/day: OR 6.11, 95% CI 3.59 to 10.42). In MR analyses of 281 105 White British participants, genetically predicted propensity to initiate smoking was associated with higher risks of infection (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.91) and hospitalisation (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.27). Genetically predicted higher number of cigarettes smoked per day was associated with higher risks of all outcomes (infection OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.20 to 5.24; hospitalisation OR 5.08, 95% CI 2.04 to 12.66; and death OR 10.02, 95% CI 2.53 to 39.72). INTERPRETATION: Congruent results from two analytical approaches support a causal effect of smoking on risk of severe COVID-19.","Clift, Ashley K; von Ende, Adam; Tan, Pui San; Sallis, Hannah M; Lindson, Nicola; Coupland, Carol A C; Munafò, Marcus R; Aveyard, Paul; Hippisley-Cox, Julia; Hopewell, Jemma C",Thorax,500,32

We aimed to examine whether serum YKL-40 and growth factors could be markers for PIBO exacerbation. Thirty-seven children admitted with acute exacerbation of PIBO were enrolled and studied retrospectively. Diagnosis of PIBO was based on clinical history of acute respiratory infection followed by persistent airway obstruction and characteristic findings in high-resolution computed tomography. Serum levels of YKL-40, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB were measured on admission. The biomarkers were also examined in children admitted with acute bronchiolitis serving as positive controls (N = 30) and in age-matched controls (N = 20). Only YKL-40 levels were found to be significantly higher in PIBO patients with exacerbation compared with that in bronchiolitis patients and showed a positive correlation with the severity of disease before diagnosis of PIBO. Conclusion: Our results suggest that measuring serum YKL-40 levels might help distinguish exacerbation of PIBO from acute bronchiolitis in young children.","Jang, Yoon Young; Park, Hye Jin; Chung, Hai Lee",Eur J Pediatr,500,20

While great global efforts are underway to develop vaccines and to discover or repurpose therapeutic agents for this disease, as of this writing only the nucleoside drug remdesivir has been approved under Emergency Use Authorization to treat COVID-19. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), a viral enzyme for viral RNA replication in host cells, is one of the most intriguing and promising drug targets for SARS-CoV-2 drug development. Because RdRP is a viral enzyme with no host cell homologs, selective SARS-CoV-2 RdRP inhibitors can be developed that have improved potency and fewer off-target effects against human host proteins and thus are safer and more effective therapeutics for treating COVID-19. This review focuses on biochemical enzyme and cell-based assays for RdRPs that could be used in high-throughput screening to discover new and repurposed drugs against SARS-CoV-2.","Zhu, Wei; Chen, Catherine Z.; Gorshkov, Kirill; Xu, Miao; Lo, Donald C.; Zheng, Wei",SLAS Discov,500,26

The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of COVID-19 on DDH-USS, in two paediatric orthopaedic centres in one of the most critical areas of the western World. METHODS: An academic teaching hospital and paediatric trauma centre (T) and a University hospital and DDH referral centre (H), classified as national COVID-19 hubs, were involved. Graf’s method was applied in both centres. In T, paediatricians directly referred only patients with delayed DDH-USS or suspicious unstable hips; in H, paediatricians or parents could directly refer to the screening service. RESULTS: The mean age of the 95 patients (190 hips) who were referred for DDH-USS in T, was 3.85 months (0.1 to 7.4); 175 were type I, nine were type IIa (+ and -), five type D and one type IV. In H, the screened patients in 2020 were only 78% of the same period in 2019. A total of 28 patients with 32 hips (8 IIb, 5 IIc, 8 D, 11 III) had late diagnosis at a mean age of 114 days (96 to 146). In the same period in 2019 only eight patients with 11 hips (8 IIb, 1 D, 1 III, 1 IV) at a mean age of 142 days (92 to 305) had late diagnosis. CONCLUSION: DDH-USS was the only screening in newborns which halted during lockdown. Few centres, which still performed diagnosis and treatment, were overloaded causing a delay in DDH management.

This lack of knowledge impedes the ability of the profession to prepare and support physiotherapists in all world regions in their ethical practice. The purpose of the study was to answer the following research questions: What types of ethical issues are experienced by physiotherapists internationally? How frequently are ethical issues experienced by physiotherapists internationally? Can the frequency and type of ethical issue experienced by physiotherapists be predicted by sociodemographic, educational or vocational variables? METHODS: An observational study was conducted in English using an online survey from October 2018 to May 2019. Participants were 1212 physiotherapists and physiotherapy students located internationally which represented less than 1% of estimated number of physiotherapists worldwide at that time. The survey questionnaire contained 13 items requesting demographic detail and knowledge of ethical codes and decision-making, and 46 items asking what frequency participants experienced specific ethical issues in four categories: (A) Physiotherapist and patient interaction (19 items), (B) Physiotherapist and other health professionals including other physiotherapists (10 items), (C) Physiotherapists and the system (5 items) and (D) Professional and economic ethical situations (12 items). RESULTS: The two most frequently experienced ethical issues were ‘Scarce resources and time affecting quality of physiotherapy treatment’ and ‘Physiotherapy not accessible to all people in society who need it’. These items were experienced, on average, more often than monthly. Interprofessional practice also presented frequent ethical issues for participants. Ethical issues related to the context of ‘Physiotherapists and the system’ were most frequently experienced for all world regions. Working longer years in physiotherapy and learning about ethics in basic physiotherapy education was associated with participants reporting lower frequencies of ethical issues across all contexts. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first global profile of ethical issues experienced by physiotherapists. Societal and cultural systems are key influences on physiotherapists’ ethical practice. Physiotherapists globally need support from their work organisations, academic institutions and professional associations, and robust ethical training, to assist them to be active moral agents in their practice.

This is because of their high potency, high specificity and desirable safety profile. The majority of biological drugs are peptide- and protein-based therapeutics with poor oral bioavailability. They are normally administered by parenteral injection (with a very few exceptions). Pulmonary delivery is an attractive non-invasive alternative route of administration for local and systemic delivery of biologics with immense potential to treat various diseases, including diabetes, cystic fibrosis, respiratory viral infection and asthma, etc. The massive surface area and extensive vascularisation in the lungs enable rapid absorption and fast onset of action. Despite the benefits of pulmonary delivery, development of inhalable biological drug is a challenging task. There are various anatomical, physiological and immunological barriers that affect the therapeutic efficacy of inhaled formulations. This review assesses the characteristics of biological drugs and the barriers to pulmonary drug delivery. The main challenges in the formulation and inhalation devices are discussed, together with the possible strategies that can be applied to address these challenges. Current clinical developments in inhaled biological drugs for both local and systemic applications are also discussed to provide an insight for further research.","Liang, Wanling; Pan, Harry W.; Vllasaliu, Driton; Lam, Jenny K.

An understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease is necessary for an effective treatment. Laboratory investigations play an important role in the diagnosis as well as treatment of this infectious disease. Hematological parameters demonstrate alterations during the progression of nCOVID-19 infection. Of these, many are indicative of extremely poor clinical outcome. Hematological findings like leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and coagulation-related abnormalities are the most common manifestations. The aim of this study was to assess the dynamic profile and clinical implications of hematological and immunological parameters among nCOVID-19 infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was designed after categorizing patients suffering from COVID-19 into three groups: (a) Group I; (b) Group II and (c) Group III or severe critical patients. Hematological and immunological parameters of neutrophilic and white blood cell counts, d-dimer levels, hemoglobin levels, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) levels and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were assessed. Statistical analysis using Kruskal–Wallis test was used. RESULTS: Normal white blood cell and neutrophil count among COVID-19 patients was seen. However, median values in Group II (P < 0.01) and Group III (P < 0.0001) were found to show significantly higher values when compared to Group I. A significant (P < 0.01) decrease in lymphocytic counts was found among severe and critical patients. Hemoglobin level was found to demonstrate higher decrease (P < 0.01) among severe and critical patients. Platelet count was found in normal range in all COVID-19 patients. Routine coagulation tests revealed increased fibrinogen (P < 0.01) and d-dimer levels (P < 0.0001) in severe and critical patients. Normal proportions of total CD3+ and CD4 + T lymphocytes were observed in COVID-19. However, CD8 + T lymphocytes proportion was found to be decreased (P-value < 0.05). Immunoglobulin G levels among Groups II and III patients were found to be lower when compared with Group I (P < 0.001). No statistical significance was observed between the groups in IgM levels. Plasma IL-6 levels were found to show progressive rise among Groups II and III patients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Analysis of hematological and immunological parameters profiles in COVID-19 patients may help in deciphering the clinical progression of patients suffering from COVID-19 disease. Thus, regular monitoring of the hospitalized patients may help in planning the management of these cases.","Suryawanshi, Shekhar Yashwant; Priya, Shrishtee; Sinha, Sandarbh Saumya; Soni, Srinath; Haidry, Naqoosh; Verma, Shilpi; Singh, Supriya",J Family Med Prim Care,500,20

There is a need to combine diverse, multi-omic data in order to evaluate and substantiate the most robust evidence and inform development of future therapies. We conducted a systematic review of experiments identifying host factors involved in human betacoronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, seasonal coronaviruses). Gene lists from these diverse sources were integrated using Meta-Analysis by Information Content (MAIC). This previously described algorithm uses data-driven gene list weightings to produce a comprehensive ranked list of implicated host genes. 5,418 genes implicated in human betacoronavirus infection were identified from 32 datasets. The top ranked gene was *PPIA*, encoding cyclophilin A. Pharmacological inhibition with cyclosporine in vitro exerts antiviral activity against several coronaviruses including SARS-CoV. Other highly-ranked genes included proposed prognostic factors (*CXCL10*, *CD4*, *CD3E*) and investigational therapeutic targets (*IL1A*) for COVID-19, but also previously overlooked genes with potential as therapeutic targets. Gene rankings also inform the interpretation of COVID-19 GWAS results, implicating *FYCO1* over other nearby genes in a disease-associated locus on chromosome 3. Pathways enriched in gene rankings included T-cell receptor signalling, protein processing, and viral infections. We identified limited overlap of our gene list with host genes implicated in ARDS (innate immune and inflammation genes) and Influenza A virus infection (RNA-binding and ribosome-associated genes). We will continue to update this dynamic ranked list of host genes as the field develops, as a resource to inform and prioritise future studies.

Severe presentation of COVID-19 is characterized by cytokine storm and chronic inflammation resulting in multi-organ dysfunction. Currently, it is unclear whether extrapulmonary tissues contribute to the cytokine storm mediated-disease exacerbation. In this study, we applied systems immunology analysis to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung, liver, kidney, and heart tissues and the potential contribution of these tissues to cytokines production. Notably, genes associated with neutrophil-mediated immune response (e.g. CXCL1) were particularly upregulated in lung, whereas genes associated with eosinophil-mediated immune response (e.g. CCL11) were particularly upregulated in heart tissue. In contrast, immune responses mediated by monocytes, dendritic cells, T-cells and B-cells were almost similarly dysregulated in all tissue types. Focused analysis of 14 cytokines classically upregulated in COVID-19 patients revealed that only some of these cytokines are dysregulated in lung tissue, whereas the other cytokines are upregulated in extrapulmonary tissues (e.g. IL6 and IL2RA). Investigations of potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 modulates the immune response and cytokine production revealed a marked dysregulation of NF-κB signaling particularly CBM complex and the NF-κB inhibitor BCL3. Moreover, overexpression of mucin family genes (e.g. MUC3A, MUC4, MUC5B, MUC16, and MUC17) and HSP90AB1 suggest that the exacerbated inflammation activated pulmonary and extrapulmonary tissues remodeling. In addition, we identified multiple sets of immune response associated genes upregulated in a tissue-specific manner (DCLRE1C, CHI3L1, and PARP14 in lung; APOA4, NFASC, WIPF3, and CD34 in liver; LILRA5, ISG20, S100A12, and HLX in kidney; and ASS1 and PTPN1 in heart). Altogether, these findings suggest that the cytokines storm triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection is potentially the result of dysregulated cytokine production by inflamed pulmonary and extrapulmonary (e.g. liver, kidney, and heart) tissues.","Hammoudeh, Sarah Musa; Hammoudeh, Arabella Musa; Bhamidimarri, Poorna Manasa; Al Safar, Habiba; Mahboub, Bassam; Künstner, Axel; Busch, Hauke; Halwani, Rabih; Hamid, Qutayba; Rahmani, Mohamed; Hamoudi, Rifat",Front Immunol,500,16

Our proposals for regulatory flexibility in these areas seek to satisfy the goals of protecting participants and promoting the development of high-quality evidence to improve patient care. These recommendations may have relevance beyond the COVID-19 pandemic to enhance the efficiency of research oversight and participant protection more broadly. Clinical research to understand, treat, and prevent COVID-19 is both crucial and highly regulated.

Here we show that passage of this mutant in the presence of high ribavirin concentrations resulted in selection of viruses with the additional replacement I248T in 2C. This 2C substitution alone (even in the absence of replacements in 3D) increased FMDV fitness mainly in the presence of ribavirin, prevented an incorporation bias in favor of A and U associated with ribavirin mutagenesis, and conferred the ATPase activity of 2C decreased sensitivity to ribavirin-triphosphate. Since in previous studies we described that 2C with I248T was selected under different selective pressures, this replacement qualifies as a joker substitution in FMDV evolution. The results have identified a role of 2C in nucleotide incorporation, and have unveiled a new polymerase-independent mechanism of virus escape to lethal mutagenesis.","Agudo, Rubén; de la Higuera, Ignacio; Arias, Armando; Grande-Pérez, Ana; Domingo, Esteban",Virology,500,16

Here, our objective is to model the influence of social behaviour on the competition between pathogen strains with differing virulence. We couple a compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model for a resident pathogen strain and a mutant strain with higher virulence, with a differential equation of a population where individuals learn to adopt protective behaviour from others according to the prevalence of infection of the two strains and the perceived severity of the respective strains in the population. We perform invasion analysis, time series analysis and phase plane analysis to show that perceived severities of pathogen strains and the efficacy of infection control against them can greatly impact the invasion of more virulent strain. We demonstrate that adaptive social behaviour enables invasion of the mutant strain under plausible epidemiological scenarios, even when the mutant strain has a lower basic reproductive number than the resident strain. Surprisingly, in some situations, increasing the perceived severity of the resident strain can facilitate invasion of the more virulent mutant strain. Our results demonstrate that for certain applications, it may be necessary to include adaptive social behaviour in models of the emergence of virulent pathogens, so that the models can better assist public health efforts to control infectious diseases.","Pharaon, Joe; Bauch, Chris T.",J Theor Biol,500,19

A quantitative study aimed to better understand heat perception and coping strategies of elderly people during heat waves to inform heat-health action plans. We conducted a representative quantitative survey via structured interviews with 258 randomly chosen people over 65 years old, living in their own homes in four areas of Cologne, Germany. These areas varied, both in terms of social status and heat strain. Data regarding demographics, health status, coping strategies, and heat perception were collected in personal interviews from August to October 2019. The majority of the participants perceived heat strain as moderate to very challenging. Women, people with a lower monthly income, and those with a lower health status found the heat more challenging. We found that participants adapted to heat with a number of body-related, home-protective, and activity-related coping strategies. The number of coping strategies was associated with perceived personal heat strain. There is a definite underuse of water-related heat adaption strategies among the elderly. This is of increasing relevance, as rising heat impact will lead to more heat-related geriatric morbidity. Our results are seminal to inform elderly-specific, socio-adapted local heat-health action plans.","Kemen, Juliane; Schäffer-Gemein, Silvia; Grünewald, Johanna; Kistemann, Thomas",Int J Environ Res Public Health,500,1

Recently, the importance of online social networks as sources of health information and social support has been brought into focus with the emergence and widespread societal impacts of COVID-19. Although online communities exist for older adults, little is known about the specific health and self-care topics that older people discuss in such environments and how these relate to users’ support needs and outcomes. A better understanding of users’ needs and peer-to-peer communication in these communities is necessary to inform the design of information and communication technology (ICT) interventions that are relevant to older people and their peer supporters. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to use a two-phase, web-based ethnographic (netnography) and co-design approach to explore specific health care and self-care topics that older adults discuss in a UK-based online community and how peer supporters respond to these queries with informational and/or social support and engage with stakeholders to define the needs and requirements for new ICT-based interventions capable of reducing social isolation and facilitating LTC self-management support. METHODS: The first phase of the research will involve a qualitative netnographic analysis of posts in discussion forums in a publicly accessible online community. The second phase will involve co-design workshops with health care consumers (ie, older adults and carers) and service providers to determine the needs and requirements for new ICT-based interventions and digital innovations. Constructivist grounded theory will be used in the first phase; in the second phase, the co-design workshops will be audiorecorded and analyzed thematically. RESULTS: This research project is in progress. Permission was obtained from the website administrator to use materials from the social media forum; data collection for the first phase began in April 2020. The second phase of the study is expected to begin in late 2020. This study is due to be completed by the end of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to combine qualitative netnography with an iterative co-design framework to specify the needs and requirements for new ICT-based interventions. The findings from this study will inform the next phase of the multiphase knowledge translation project and will provide insights into the potential of online peer health communities to reduce social isolation and facilitate chronic illness self-management support and self-care.

People with less money are not only forced to spend it on food, but have so limited options for avoiding purchase of foods with high levels of fat, salt, and sugar. A review of the literature shows that very little is known about how mobile food trucks can increase availability and affordability of healthy foods in low-income neighborhoods in the United States. We compared municipal codes regulating mobile food truck operators and evaluated the impact on cities in the Midwest for encouraging a ‘culture of health.’ We analyzed six Midwest metropolitan areas with the highest proportion of minorities who lived below the poverty level and had mobile food trucks selling provisions in their neighborhoods. We found that developing more incentives for mobile food truck operators to sell healthier food options can contribute to improving health outcomes in low-income neighborhoods.","Wallace, Edward V.",J Public Health Policy,500,30

Its limitation or suspension, recursively extended over time, could be associated with a significant increase in the number of blind people worldwide. Indeed, cataract causes more than half of all cases of visual impairment in those countries with limited availability of means for performing eye operations (e.g., Africa or India). In this scenario, the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly resulted in the suspension or sharp reduction of various ophthalmic activities considered non-urgent, including lens replacement surgery or some intraocular injections. Despite the imperative need to continuously practice eye operations to avoid the abovementioned problems, there are currently little-shared and vague recommendations among the various countries on safety in operating rooms (for health care workers and patients) and poor legal protection for surgeons (potentially transmitting the COVID-19 infectious agent). Herein, we individuated and discussed some critical points in safety recommendations and medical liability. A paradigm shift for ocular surgery during the COVID-19 era is now mandatory. While telemedicine has been able to solve some problems in clinical ophthalmology, the lack of adequate health and legal protection for surgeons and patients may result in an excessive reduction in the volume of surgical interventions during a pandemic era and the immediately following period, thus determining inability to ensure health care to all patients.","Napoli, Pietro Emanuele; Nioi, Matteo; d’Aloja, Ernesto; Fossarello, Maurizio",J Clin Med,500,20

Touching contaminated surfaces followed by hand to facial transfer has been identified as a potential infection route. As humans involuntarily touch their faces over 20 times per hour a hand washing with soap and water is recommended to avoid hands to face transmission. To date however, there is no clear explanation how the viruses arrive form the face into the nose and the lung. Our hypothesis is that during the physiological nasal air inspiration the virion particles attached on the face close to the nose are resuspended in the air and then are inhaled into the nose.

For these reasons, they are receiving more and more attention in recent years, especially future food or feed development. EPA and DHA come mainly from marine sources like fish or seaweed. Unfortunately, due to global warming, these compounds are becoming scarce for humans because of overfishing and stock reduction. Although increasing in recent years, aquaculture appears insufficient to meet the increasing requirements of these healthy molecules for humans. One alternative resides in the cultivation of microalgae, the initial producers of EPA and DHA. They are also rich in biochemicals with interesting properties.

The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and its pathology of associated acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, coagulopathy and multiorgan failure is not known. SARS-CoV-2 is an envelope virus with S (spike), M (membrane), N (nucleocapsid) and E (envelop) proteins. In a closely related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the transmembrane E protein exerts an important role in membrane-ionic transport through viroporins, deletion of which reduced levels of IL-1β and a remarkably reduced lung edema compared to wild type. IL-1β is generated by macrophages upon activation of intracellular NLRP3 (NOD-like, leucine rich repeat domains, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3), part of the functional NLRP3 inflammasome complex that detects pathogenic microorganisms and stressors, while neutrophils are enhanced by increasing levels of IL-1β. Expiring neutrophils undergo “NETosis”, producing thread-like extracellular structures termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which protect against mild infections and microbes. However, uncontrolled NET production can cause acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coagulopathy, multiple organ failure, and autoimmune disease. Herein, we present arguments underlying our hypothesis that IL-1β and NETs, mediated via NLRP3 inflammasomes, form a feed-forward loop leading to the excessive alveolar and endothelial damage observed in severe cases of COVID-19. Considering such assertions, we propose potential drug candidates that could be used to alleviate such pathologies.

CONCLUSION: Parkinson's patients with poor visual function show increased white matter damage over time, providing further evidence for visual function as a marker of imminent cognitive decline. © 2021 The Authors.

Methods: This clinical trial was conducted at Polk County Fire Rescue (PCFR), one of the largest EMS systems in the state of Florida. PCFR responds to over 115,000 calls per year and covers a geographic area of over 2000 square miles. The study assessed COVID-19 antibody status in PCFR medics and correlated antibody status to 1) symptomatology, 2) amount of patient contact and 3) individual co-morbidities. For symptoms survey, medics were given a QR code to a survey prior to antibody testing. Results: The median age was 43 years (IQR 33-52). 41% were female. 83% were White, 9% were Black, 1% were Asian, and 6% were other. 12% were Hispanic. 33% had the following co-morbidities: 5% diabetes, 6% asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 17% had hypertension. Forty five percent had received their influenza vaccine. The median BMI was 19.8 (IQR 25.9-34.8 ). 19% were symptomatic. The most common symptoms were cough, fatigue and headache. Almost 40% had direct patient contact. 15% had less than 5 hours per week;27% had 5-20 hours per week, and 57% had more than 20 hours per week of direct patient contact. A total of 7% had a positive COVID-19 antibody test. The only univariate analysis that was statistically significant for antibody status was race. Blacks had 3.94 times the odds of having a positive COVID-19 antibody compared to Whites. (P=0.0012 Pearson correlation, 95% CI 0.0560 – 0.2248). Black race remained a statistically significant predictor in a multivariate model that included the age, sex, BMI, number of hours of direct patient contact, whether the medic was symptomatic, presence of co-morbidities and whether or not the medic had received a flu shot prior was symptomatic (P=0.0008, 95% CI 0.0621-0.2354). Conclusion: In a cohort of paramedics actively managing patients, the COVID-19 positivity rate was significantly higher in Blacks compared to Whites. Symptomatology did not correlate with the presence of antibodies. [Formula presented]","Banerjee, P.; Ganti, L.; Stead, T.; Campion, B.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,500,27

It has raised questions about recognizing and differentiating coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from COPD given the similarity of the symptoms. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Science Committee used established methods for literature review to present an overview of the management of patients with COPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear whether patients with COPD are at increased risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. During periods of high community prevalence of COVID-19, spirometry should only be used when it is essential for COPD diagnosis and/or to assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery. Patients with COPD should follow basic infection control measures, including social distancing, hand washing, and wearing a mask or face covering. Patients should remain up to date with appropriate vaccinations, particularly annual influenza vaccination. Although data are limited, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators, roflumilast, or chronic macrolides should continue to be used as indicated for stable COPD management. Systemic steroids and antibiotics should be used in COPD exacerbations according to the usual indications. Differentiating symptoms of COVID-19 infection from chronic underlying symptoms or those of an acute COPD exacerbation may be challenging. If there is suspicion for COVID-19, testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered. Patients who developed moderate-to-severe COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia, should be treated with evolving pharmacotherapeutic approaches as appropriate, including remdesivir, dexamethasone, and anticoagulation. Managing acute respiratory failure should include appropriate oxygen supplementation, prone positioning, noninvasive ventilation, and protective lung strategy in patients with COPD and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients who developed asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 should be followed with the usual COPD protocols. Patients who developed moderate or worse COVID-19 should be monitored more frequently and accurately than the usual patients with COPD, with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.","Halpin, David M.

During the SARS epidemic, Toronto was included as a travel location in the SARS definition. The lack of preparedness at our facility became evident in June 2003, when a patient was admitted with a fever, infiltrates, and recent travel to Toronto. This admission revealed many failure modes in our system for identifying and containing SARS. Twenty-one healthcare workers (HCWs) had unprotected exposure to the suspected case. As a result, the HCWs were screened prior to reporting to work for the 10 days following their exposure. Improper handling of lab specimens delayed testing. The case eventually was ruled out as a SARS case. PROJECT: A multidisciplinary team was formed to conduct a root-cause analysis (RCA) of the potential SARS exposure. Several process failures were identified, from admission through specimen handling. The team recognized that the frequency of admitting a SARS patient was low; however, the potential health threat was high. Rather than conduct additional educational sessions, a SARS Toolkit was developed for the hospital units. The kit contained step-by-step instructions, visuals, and a notification list. The kit's built-in forcing functions were designed to move the process along, but not to rely on HCWs memory. The new process was tested in a mock SARS admission drill. Only administration and the RCA team knew about the drill. The drill was completed in 3 hours. RESULTS: The kit was activated immediately and key departments, including infection control, were notified. Personal protective equipment was obtained and the patient was placed in the proper isolation. Laboratory specimens were processed and handled appropriately. HCW exposure did not occur. The kit assisted in preventing exposures while allowing for patient care. A debriefing followed the drill and included all HCWs involved, administration, and the RCA team. The mock patient was able to provide additional information regarding objects with potential fomite contamination that were brought out of the room. LESSONS LEARNED: Preparedness for events that may or may not occur challenged us to create a process that would succeed. Overall, the kit proved its worth with well-defined instructions for communication. At any time, it could easily be updated. It was identified that some signage needed clarification, and changes were made to the kit. The kit has since been adopted by our system hospitals.","Berriel-Cass∗, D.; Gorczyca, J.; Roth, L.

We aim to review the various aspects of patient-centered care via diabetes self-management education based on available literature. METHODS: This is a narrative review using Pubmed, EMBASE and Google Scholar search till March 29, 2020. Search terms were “COVID-19”, “diabetes self-care”, “diabetes self-management education”, “DSME”, “diabetes self-management in India”, “diabetes self-care in India” and “DSME in India”. RESULTS: We have discussed an educational plan on diabetes self-management that can be adopted for people with diabetes mellitus in our country amid the ongoing pandemic. We have also identified the barriers to diabetes self-management in the current scenario and suggested possible solutions to overcome those. CONCLUSIONS: We have reemphasized the need for a simultaneous patient-centered approach in routine diabetes care that has to be coordinated by a multidisciplinary team amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Banerjee, Mainak; Chakraborty, Soumen; Pal, Rimesh",Diabetes Metab Syndr,500,1
