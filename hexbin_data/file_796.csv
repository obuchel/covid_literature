Ultrametrics on a set of individuals is introduced based on their hierarchical clustering relative to the average time of infection contact. The general equations of the ultrametric SIR model are written down and their particular implementation using the [Formula: see text]-adic parametrization is presented. A numerical analysis of the [Formula: see text]-adic SIR model and a comparison of its behavior with the classical SIR model are performed. The concept of hierarchical isolation and the scenario of its management in order to reduce the level of epidemic spread is considered.,"Volov, V. T.; Zubarev, A.

Among some analysts, observations have been made that the lockdown represents a new opportunity to revitalize rural livelihoods and smallholder agriculture. This paper evaluates these claims by exploring the impact of COVID‐19 on household food security and smallholder food production in Chimborazo, a highland province that is known for extremely high rates of poverty and the highest concentration of Kichwa‐speaking Indigenous people in Ecuador. Drawing upon original empirical research, it makes the case that the prospects for revitalizing smallholder production remain structurally constrained by a legacy of land inequality and failed agrarian reform. According to our findings, the only sectors that thrived during the lockdown were ones that served local markets. For those requiring significant shipping and storage, merchants and traders were able to drive down farmgate prices, squeezing local producers. At the same time, new government legislation made it easier for employers to terminate wage labourers, undermining a vital source of income and employment for low‐income households. Far from revitalizing smallholder agriculture, the pandemic appears to have further entrenched an economic model of supporting agribusiness at the expense of family farms and migrant labour.","McBurney, Matthew; Tuaza, Luis Alberto; Ayol, Carlos; Johnson, Craig A.",,796,16

It enables users to verify key aspects of their applications, systematically compare and validate the simulation outputs against observational or benchmark data, and run simulations conveniently on any platform from the desktop to current multi-petascale computers. In this sequel to our paper on VECMAtk which we presented last year [1] we focus on a range of functional and performance improvements that we have introduced, cover newly introduced components, and applications examples from seven different domains such as conflict modelling and environmental sciences. We also present several implemented patterns for UQ/SA and V&V, and guide the reader through one example concerning COVID-19 modelling in detail.

Whether PCT can detect secondary bacterial infections or reflect target tissue injury in this setting is still unclear. Here we performed a meta-analysis to review the prognostic value of PCT for severe disease and adverse outcome events in COVID-19.Methods: We searched relevant publications in online databases. Studies were included if they reported categorical data according to disease severity and/or outcomes. We analysed extracted data using fixed or random-effects meta-analysis models, as appropriate, depending on the presence of significant heterogeneity. Results: Data from 14 studies (3492 patients) were included in the analysis. Overall, 163 of 256 patients with elevated PCT had severe disease (63.7%) compared with 553 of 2047 with negative PCT (27.0%) (OR: 5.92; 95% CI: 3.20 to 10.94). Elevated PCT was also associated with adverse outcomes (OR: 13.1; 95% CI: 7.37 to 23.1). PCT was increased in 22.8% and 30.6% of patients with the severe course and adverse outcome, respectively. Rates of secondary bacterial infections ranged from 4.7% to 19.5% and were associated with increased risk of severe course or fatal outcomes (OR: 20.8; 95% CI: 11.6 to 37.4). Conclusions: Elevated PCT levels could identify a subset of COVID-19 patients at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcome. Its limitations include low sensitivity and undefined cost-utility ratio. Whether PCT may be used for detecting secondary bacterial infections and guiding antibiotic therapy in COVID-19 is still undefined.","Vazzana, Natale; Dipaola, Francesco; Ognibene, Silvia",Acta Clin Belg,796,5

Kondisi ini membuat sebagian orang cemas dan bahkan panik. Potensi panik ini dapat menyerang siapapun tidak terkecuali mahasiswa. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk melihat kepanikan dan resiliensi mahasiswa pascasarjana Aceh-Yogyakarta dalam menghadapi pandemi COVID-19. Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian lapangan (Field Research) dengan menggunakan pendekatan kualitatif. Metode penelitian menggunakan metode deskriptif analitis. Pengumpulan data dilakukan dengan observasi partisipan dan wawancara dengan menggunakan Whatsapp. Teknik pengambilan sampel dalam penelitian ini menggunakan Purposive sampling yaitu pengambilan sampel berdasarkan kriteria yang telah ditentukan oleh peneliti. Analisis data dilakukan dengan cara reduksi, penyajian dan pengambilan kesimpulan. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa mahasiswa pasca sarjana tidak menunjukkan gejala kepanikan melainkan rasa kekhawatiran terhadap pandemi COVID-19. Mahasiswa pascasarjana Aceh-Yogyakarta juga memiliki resiliensi dalam menghadapi pandemi COVID-19. Hal ini terlihat dari kemampuan mahasiswa dalam menghadapi situasi dengan tenang dan menentukan langkah yang rasional dalam berbagai tindakan serta memiliki pandangan positif dalam menghadapi tantangan yang sedang dihadapi. Adapun bentuk-bentuk resiliensinya meliputi mengikuti instruksi dari pemerintah, meningkatkan daya tahan atau imun, mengurangi akses terhadap informasi COVID-19, mengambil hikmah dari COVID-19, menyerahkan segalanya kepada Allah SWT.","Saputra, Teuku Amnar",Jurnal Bimbingan Dan Konseling Ar-Rahman,796,1
