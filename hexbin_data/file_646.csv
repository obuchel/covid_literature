26121,"Hazards, Disasters, and Risks",2019-06-05,"Next-generation sequencing has the ability to revolutionize almost all fields of biological science. It has drastically reduced the cost of sequencing. This allows us to study the whole genome or part of the genome to understand how the cellular functions are governed by the genetic code. The data obtained in huge quantity from sequencing upon analysis gives an insight to understand the mechanism of pathogen biology, virulence, and phenomenon of bacterial resistance, which helps in investigating the outbreak. This ultimately helps in the development of therapies for public health welfare against human pathogen and diagnostic reagents for the screening. This chapter includes the basic of Sanger’s method of DNA sequencing and next-generation sequencing, different available platforms for sequencing with their advantages, and limitations and their chemistry with an overview of downstream data analysis. Furthermore, the breadth of applications of high-throughput NGS technology for human health has been discussed.","Gupta, Nidhi; Verma, Vijay K.",Microbial Technology for the Welfare of Society,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122948/,646

30111,The Travel and Tourism Industry and PR's Role in It,2009-11-16,"Innate immune responses to pathogens are evolutionarily ancient and are found in the most primitive organisms. These are highly conserved and are not pathogen-specific, but are in response to classes of molecular structures. Infections can be perceived both extracellularly and intracellularly by Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) and their host cell ligands, Pathogen Recognition Receptors (PRRs), among them, Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs). The innate immune response to infection includes the release of soluble preformed mediators, or synthesis of cytoplasmic enzymes, cytokines, chemokines, interferons (IFNs), lipid mediators, proteins of the complement cascade, neurotransmitters, nucleotides, and components of transcription factors (High Mobility Group B1, receptors for sex hormones/steroids). Directed cellular migration of parenchymal astrocytes and microglia, as well as recruitment across the blood brain barrier (BBB) of circulating neutrophils, natural killer, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and ultimately T lymphocytes to the site of infection are also hallmarks of innate responses to infections. These responding cells contribute their own secreted effector molecules and effector activities (such as phagocytosis). Distinct viruses are capable of infecting every cell type (endothelial cells, ependymal cells, perivascular macrophages and pericytes, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells, and neurons) in the central nervous system (CNS). These CNS infections challenge the host with a different set of problems than do peripheral viral infections. Among the complications are (a) neurons that rarely express Class I or Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules and are thus not suitable targets for either CD4(+) or CD8(+) MHC-restricted T cells, (b) an enclosed volume that is constrained from swelling during inflammation, as well as poorly developed lymphatic drainage, and (c) the immunologic privilege of the CNS which leads to extremely limited immune surveillance for pathogens. Therefore, the role of innate immunity, both from CNS-resident cells and their products, and from circulating inflammatory cells and molecules which traverse the BBB are essential to “buy time,” inhibiting viral replication and dissemination, until the host can marshal an adaptive immune response. The immune responses are crucial for host survival from the infection. Consequently, successful pathogens, especially those that persist, have developed a wide variety of evasive approaches to limit the inhibition of replication. Many of these pathways are highlighted in individual chapters that precede this one. These evasive measures range from neutralizing host secreted molecules (cytokines and chemokines) with soluble receptors, encoding anti-inflammatory proteins in their genome, preventing signal transduction, blocking inhibition of protein synthesis, degradation of essential antiviral molecules, preventing apoptosis, and blockade of the nuclear pore complex. In this chapter, I will attempt to cover the breadth of the innate immune response to viral infection, but will also devote more space to generally under-considered aspects than to the well-known components. There are some caveats to consider, as most experiments have been performed in the murine model and not in man; further, conclusions from experiments using in vitro cultured cells (whether primary or established lines) may not reflect physiological conditions in an undisturbed CNS. Lastly, we now appreciate the complexities imposed on hosts by polymorphisms in genes of critical pathways, leading to increased susceptibility or resistance of that individual but not others.","Reiss, Carol Shoshkes",Neurotropic Viral Infections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153449/,646
34511,Designing Authentic Assessments: Engaging Business Students in Flow Experience with Digital Technologies,2020-05-11,"The COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased demand for medical and protective equipment by frontline health workers, as well as the general community, causing the supply chain to stretch beyond capacity, an issue further heightened by geographical and political lockdowns. Various 3D printing technologies were quickly utilised by businesses, institutions and individuals to manufacture a range of products on-demand, close to where they were needed. This study gathered data about 91 3D printed projects initiated prior to April 1, 2020, as the virus spread globally. It found that 60% of products were for personal protective equipment, of which 62% were 3D printed face shields. Fused filament fabrication was the most common 3D print technology used, and websites were the most popular means of centralising project information. The project data provides objective, quantitative insight balanced with qualitative critical review of the broad trends, opportunities and challenges that could be used by governments, health and medical bodies, manufacturing organisations and the 3D printing community to streamline the current response, as well as plan for future crises using a distributed, flexible manufacturing approach.","Novak, James I.; Loy, Jennifer",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7292530/,646
35403,"Regime Change: Education to Work Transitions in England, 1980s–2020s",2020-06-25,"As a fairly frequent form of the Axiom of Choice about relatively simple structures (posets), Hausdorff’s Maximal Chain Principle appears to be little amenable to computational interpretation. This received view, however, requires revision. When attempting to convert Hausdorff’s principle into a conservation theorem, we have indeed found out that maximal chains are more reminiscent of maximal ideals than it might seem at first glance. The latter live in richer algebraic structures (rings), and thus are readier to be put under computational scrutiny. Exploiting the newly discovered analogy between maximal chains and ideals, we can carry over the concept of Jacobson radical from a ring to an arbitrary set with an irreflexive symmetric relation. This achievement enables us to present a generalisation of Hausdorff’s principle first as a semantic and then as a syntactical conservation theorem. We obtain the latter, which is nothing but the desired computational core of Hausdorff’s principle, by passing from maximal chains to paths of finite binary trees of an adequate inductively generated class. In addition to Hausdorff’s principle, applications include the Maximal Clique Principle for undirected graphs. Throughout the paper we work within constructive set theory.","Schuster, Peter; Wessel, Daniel",Beyond the Horizon of Computability,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7309501/,646

Diseases that spreads through the vineyard has a huge economic impact, therefore it is considered as a challenge for viticulture. Automatic detection and mapping of vine disease in earlier stage can help to limit its impact and reduces the use of chemicals. This study deals with the problem of locating symptomatic areas in images from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using the visible and infrared domains. This paper, proposes a new method, based on segmentation by a convolutional neuron network SegNet and a depth map (DM), to delineate the asymptomatic regions in the vine canopy. The results obtained showed that SegNet combined with the depth information give better accuracy than a SegNet segmentation alone.","Kerkech, Mohamed; Hafiane, Adel; Canals, Raphael; Ros, Frederic",Image and Signal Processing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7340882/,646

37935,"Inclusion, Measurement and Relevance… and Covid-19",2020-08-17,"Model management is a central activity in Software Engineering. The most challenging aspect of model management is to keep models consistent with each other while they evolve. As a consequence, there has been increasing activity in this area, which has produced a number of approaches to address this synchronization challenge. The majority of these approaches, however, is limited to a binary setting; i.e. the synchronization of exactly two models with each other. A recent Dagstuhl seminar on multidirectional transformations made it clear that there is a need for further investigations in the domain of general multiple model synchronization simply because not every multiary consistency relation can be factored into binary ones. However, with the help of an auxiliary artifact, which provides a global view over all models, multiary synchronization can be achieved by existing binary model synchronization means. In this paper, we propose a novel comprehensive system construction to produce such an artifact using the same underlying base modelling language as the one used to define the models. Our approach is based on the definition of partial commonalities among a set of aligned models. Comprehensive systems can be shown to generalize the underlying categories of graph diagrams and triple graph grammars and can efficiently be implemented in existing tools.","Stünkel, Patrick; König, Harald; Lamo, Yngve; Rutle, Adrian",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7418120/,646
37936,Embodied Social Justice Pedagogy in a Time of ‘No Touch’,2020-08-17,"Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) is an important method for testing of programs. An important system on DSE is KLEE [1] which inputs a C/C++ program annotated with symbolic variables, compiles it into LLVM, and then emulates the execution paths of LLVM using a specified backtracking strategy. The major challenge in symbolic execution is path explosion. The method of abstraction learning [7] has been used to address this. The key step here is the computation of an interpolant to represent the learned abstraction. TracerX, our tool, is built on top of KLEE and it implements and utilizes abstraction learning. The core feature in abstraction learning is subsumption of paths whose traversals are deemed to no longer be necessary due to similarity with already-traversed paths. Despite the overhead of computing interpolants, the pruning of the symbolic execution tree that interpolants provide often brings significant overall benefits. In particular, TracerX can fully explore many programs that would be impossible for any non-pruning system like KLEE to do so.","Jaffar, Joxan; Maghareh, Rasool; Godboley, Sangharatna; Ha, Xuan-Linh",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7418121/,646

39082,Hotel managers’ perceptions towards the use of robots: a mixed-methods approach,2020-09-12,"Recent advances in identification and characterization of human-specific regulatory DNA sequences set the stage for the assessment of their global impact on physiology and pathology of modern humans. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of 8405 genes linked with 35,074 human-specific neuro-regulatory single-nucleotide changes (hsSNCs) revealed numerous significant associations with morphological structures, physiological processes, and pathological conditions of modern humans. Significantly enriched traits include more than 1000 anatomically distinct regions of the adult human brain, many different types of cells and tissues, more than 200 common human disorders, and more than 1000 records of rare diseases. Thousands of genes connected with neuro-regulatory hsSNCs have been identified, which represent essential genetic elements of the autosomal inheritance and offspring survival phenotypes. A total of 1494 hsSNC-linked genes are associated with either autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance, and 2273 hsSNC-linked genes have been associated with premature death, embryonic lethality, as well as pre-, peri-, neo-, and post-natal lethality phenotypes of both complete and incomplete penetrance. Differential GSEA implemented on hsSNC-linked loci and associated genes identify a set of 7990 hsSNC-target genes linked to evolutionary distinct classes of human-specific regulatory sequences (HSRS). Notably, the expression of a majority of these genes (5389 genes; 67%) is regulated by stem cell–associated retroviral sequences (SCARS) and SCARS-regulated genes captured a dominant fraction (91%) of significant phenotypic associations linked with hsSNCs. Interrogations of the MGI database revealed readily available mouse models tailored for precise experimental definitions of functional effects of hsSNCs and SCARS on genes causally affecting thousands of mammalian phenotypes and implicated in hundreds of common and rare human disorders. These observations suggest that a preponderance of human-specific traits evolved under a combinatorial regulatory control of distinct classes of HSRS and neuro-regulatory loci harboring hsSNCs that are fixed in humans, distinct from other primates, and located in differentially accessible chromatin regions during brain development.

The aim of this work was to evaluate a PCR and RT-PCR techniques as rapid methods for detecting V. parahaemolyticus AHPND-positive P. monodon using genetic markers. Healthy and diseased shrimp (P. monodon) samples were collected from three monitoring stations. The samples were enriched in TCBS plates and DNA extraction from the cultured bacteria. DNA quantifications, PCR amplification, RT-PCR, and gene sequencing were done for the detection of V. parahaemolyticus AHPND-positive P. monodon. The sequence of PCR amplicons showed 100% identity and significant alignment with V. parahaemolyticus. The primers used provided high specificity for V. parahaemolyticus in PCR detection compared with another Vibrio species. In the PCR, amplification resulted positive amplicons, whereas, non-AHPND isolates showed no amplicons. Neighbor-joining methods indicated that all genes evolved from a common ancestor and clades have different traits with very low genetic distance and low variability. The pairwise alignment scores of atpA, tox, blaCARB, 16S rRNA, and pirA genes were 100.0, 98.90, 98.89, 95.53, and 41.42, respectively. The RT-qPCR exposed variable expression levels for all genes in the AHPND-positive strain. Homology analysis and distance matrix exhibited all genes to have the lowest similarity and most divergence, offering the highest specificity. In this study, the expression and variability of target genes confirmed the presence of V. parahaemolyticus in all sampling sites. The results suggested that PCR amplification, RT-qPCR, and gene sequencing can be used for the rapid detection of V. parahaemolyticus in AHPND-positive P. monodon that may lead to subsequent prevention and treatment research in the future for managing this disease.","Hossain, Md.

Then, in the second part, the most effective parameters on PPV were selected to be applied in hybrid artificial neural network (ANN)-based models i.e., genetic algorithm (GA)-ANN, particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ANN, imperialism competitive algorithm (ICA)-ANN, artificial bee colony (ABC)-ANN and firefly algorithm (FA)-ANN for the prediction of PPV. Many hybrid ANN-based models were constructed according to the most influential parameters of GA, PSO, ICA, ABC and FA optimization techniques and 5 hybrid ANN-based models were proposed to predict PPVs induced by blasting. Through simple ranking technique, the best hybrid model was selected. The obtained results revealed that the FA-ANN model is able to offer higher accuracy level for PPV prediction compared to other implemented hybrid models.

42226,Consider technology that helps promote social distancing,2020-10-14,"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA authorized emergency use of nucleic acid amplification (NAA) testing. Accurate and rapid testing identifies infected persons, especially among at-risk populations. In our institution, the InGenius platform detects three gene targets of SARS-Coronavirus-2: envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Nonconcordance of these components present accuracy or precision errors or may correspond to varying expression of viral genes with disease progression. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the result components from 93 nasopharyngeal swabs from 50 patients older than 60 years and positive for SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The symptom onset date was determined by chart review. RESULTS: We found a significant 26% nonconcordance rate, with a predominant pattern demonstrating positive N with negative RdRp and E (χ2 = 27.25, P < 0.0005). This nonconcordant pattern was more prevalent at longer symptom durations. In 7 patients with serial testing, the transition from concordant to nonconcordant results occurred 12 days (95% CI 3.5 – 20.3 days) after symptom onset. CONCLUSION: This may be caused by several mechanisms. Possibilities include decreased expression of E and RdRp over time, inhibition of expression by treatments or host immune response, or lower viral titers by clearance or migration to the lower respiratory tract. Presence of a different viral strain or systematic processing errors are less likely causes of nonconcordance. Future directions of study would determine whether a similar decline in RdRp and E detection is seen in tracheal samples or if this correlates with changes in symptom severity.","Caulkins, H; Rand, K; Harris, N; Beal, S",Am J Clin Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7665298/,646

As of April 9, 2020, New York State had become the single largest global epicenter of COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of the first 33 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted from the emergency department to a general medicine unit in a single academic hospital in New York City between March 11th to March 27th, 2020. Patient’s demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiographic investigations, treatments and clinical outcomes were retrospectively extracted from the electronic medical record and followed until April 10th, 2020. Patients were divided into severe and nonsevere sub-cohorts. Statistics were descriptive in nature. RESULTS: The study cohort (median age 68 yr, 67% male) presented with subjective fevers (82%), cough (88%), and dyspnea (76%). The median incubation period was 3 days. Most cases met SIRS criteria upon admission (76%). Patients had elevated inflammatory markers. Patients were treated with antimicrobials, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, and varying levels of supplemental oxygen. Mortality was 15% and 18% of the cohort required intensive care services. CONCLUSION: Patient age, presenting clinical symptoms, comorbidity profile, laboratory biomarkers, and radiographic features are consistent with findings published from China. Severe patients had peaks in inflammatory biomarkers later in the hospitalization, which may be useful to trend.

Using data on rating changes from S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch, we find a more modest price reaction to rating downgrades than documented elsewhere and show that stock prices respond to changes in long-term issuer ratings but not to changes in ratings of a single instrument or a subset of instruments. Most interestingly, we find that prices start moving before a downgrade announcement, controlling for other news and investor anticipation. These pre-announcement movements are concentrated among observations where credit analysts are motivated to disclose private information to advance their careers. The beneficiaries of these disclosures appear to be institutional investors.","Even-Tov, Omri; Ozel, Naim Bugra",Rev Account Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7788283/,646

It is thus necessary to ensure that it is well-connected, efficient, robust, and secure. Despite extensive research on its topology, the temporal evolution of the network’s robustness remains largely unexplored. In the present paper, a methodology is proposed to identify long-term trends in the evolution of the network’s topology and robustness over time. The study of the U.S. domestic ATN’s robustness was performed based on annual flight data from 1996 to 2016 and network analytics were used to examine the effects of restructuring that followed the 9/11 events. Centrality measures were computed and a node deletion method was applied to assess the network’s tolerance to a targeted attack scenario. The outcome of this study indicated that the 9/11 terrorist attacks triggered vast restructuring of the network, in terms of efficiency and security. Air traffic expanded, as new airports and air routes were introduced, allowing the network to recover rapidly and become more efficient. Security concerns resulted in significant improvement of the network’s robustness. Since 2001, the global traffic and topological properties of the U.S. ATN have displayed continuous growth, due to the network’s expansion. On the other hand, the results suggest that although the system’s ability to sustain its operational level under extreme circumstances has lately improved, its tolerance to targeted attacks has deteriorated. The presented methodology has shown its potential to be applied on different network levels or different transportation networks, in order to provide a general perspective of the system’s vulnerabilities.","Siozos-Rousoulis, Leonidas; Robert, Dimitri; Verbeke, Wouter",J Transp Secur,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7790598/,646

45928,Understanding the Development of Chinese EFL Student–Teachers’ Pedagogical Content Knowledge,2021-02-05,"Amid growing concern regarding the potential added burden of care due to population aging, we have very little understanding of what is the burden of care in aging populations. To answer this question, we introduce a novel metric that encompasses demographic complexity and social context to summarize unpaid family care work provided to children, elderly, and other family members across the life cycle at a population level. The measure (Care Life Expectancy), an application of the Sullivan method, estimates the number of years and proportion of adult life that people spend in an unpaid caregiving role. We demonstrate the value of the metric by using it to describe gender differences in unpaid care work in 23 European aging countries. We find that at age 15, women and men are expected to be in an unpaid caregiving role for over half of their remaining life. For women in most of the countries, over half of those years will involve high-level caregiving for a family member. We also find that men lag in caregiving across most countries, even when using the lowest threshold of caregiving. As we show here, demographic techniques can be used to enhance our understanding of the gendered implications of population aging, particularly as they relate to policy research and public debate.

In the field of arterial hypertension the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic also determined major parts of the scientific debate. Arterial hypertension is associated with a severe course of COVID-19, whereas risk of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) does not appear to be increased in hypertensive individuals. According to current data, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers is not associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV‑2 infection or with a more severe course of COVID-19. A study on antihypertensive chronotherapy determined the scientific discourse on the medication treatment of hypertension. The HYGIA study concluded that bedtime medication reduces the cardiovascular risk in patients with arterial hypertension. Due to some study limitations, routine administration of bedtime antihypertensive medication cannot be recommended. Some of the reasons are discussed herein. Another scientific focus was on new renal denervation studies. Here, one can summarize that according to novel evidence, catheter-based renal denervation is an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of arterial hypertension, which could become established as an alternative to pharmaceutical blood pressure reduction in the near future.","Mahfoud, Felix; Böhm, Michael; Dörr, Oliver; Halbach, Marcel; Kintscher, Ulrich",Kardiologe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7943936/,646

However, the implementation of these norms and agreements remain uneven at best and non-existent at worst. Moreover, the trend of countries pursuing “nation first” policies that threaten multilateralism and global governance is likely to further impair the UN’s operational role.

Building upon the role of maritime informatics to achieve transparency, control, mitigate risks, and reduce the costs within each of these categories, different opportunities are acknowledged and associated with different shipping segments. Consideration is also given to economic advantage, resilience, compliance, and sustainability emerging from transparency in financial processes that comes with digital data sharing.

Yet misunderstanding and underrepresentation of vocational education persists in the UK and elsewhere. Vocational education is widely and publicly applauded as being a ‘good thing’. However, the academic pathway continues to hold a higher status, receive greater public recognition as well as benefiting from privileged access to funding. While a public consensus appears to exist that vocational education is a good thing in private many people prefer their children to follow an academic education. In other words, vocational education is a good thing, ‘as long as it’s for other people’s children’ (Coughlan, Vocational Education’s Global Gap. BBC News, December 16. Retrieved from http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35061496, 2015). This chapter is written from the perspective of a UK policy professional. It argues that vocational education matters deeply not only for the sake of the economy but also for the good of education. Through analysis of government policy and other publications, statistical data and a review of the literature, this chapter offers insights into the complexities of the Further, Adult and Vocational Education (FAVE) policy landscape in England.

52549,COVID-19 cases prediction in multiple areas via shapelet learning,2021-05-07,"Introduction: Diabetes is a disease of persistent hyperglycemia with a devastating complication and even death if left untreated. Morbidity and mortality often increased for any condition among patients with diabetes. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute and life-threatening complication of diabetes. It can occur to type 2 diabetes (T2DM) under severe stress. Since the pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei China, in December 2019, more than 47 million infected cases reported leading to more than 1.2 million deaths reported worldwide. The presence of diabetes in COVID19 patients had a higher odd of severity and mortality of the COVID19 compared to patients without diabetes. Our study aims to identify the incidence rate of DKA in T2DM admitted with COVID19 in a tertiary care center. Evidence showed those populations at considerable risk for morbidity and mortality and no available data in Saudi Arabia. Method: A retrospective cohort of adult patients admitted for COVID19, with a diagnosis of T2DM or clinical evidence of DKA in a tertiary care center named King Fahad Medical City located in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. The study involved a chart review. Data collected from the beginning of March 2020 till the end of June 2020. Results: Of 244 patients with T2DM admitted for COVID19, 190 patients were male, and 55 patients were female. The mean age was 59-year-old. out of 244 patients collected, 20 had developed DKA. The incidence rate of DKA was 8%. Number and percentage of male was 15 (71.4%) and female 6 (28.6%). Out of 20 patients admitted with DKA and COVID-19, two patients were not known to have diabetes prior to the presentation. Mortality resulted in 5 out of 20 during admission stay, represent 25% of all patients with DKA. Discussion: Here we report the first study in S.A. about DKA incidence in T2DM with COVID19 pneumonia. In the present study, an alarming observation of a higher incidence of DKA in a patient with type 2 diabetes and COVID19 infection as incidence reaches 8% over a short period of time while incidence worldwide area range was less than 2 per 1000 person-year for DKA in type 2 diabetes without COVID19. A study reported 20 % of patients who have diabetes and COVID19 presented ketosis developed DKA. We report the incidence of DKA in selected group. The mortality rate was not far from different evidence in the world. The mortality rate was 25% in the present study. In the USA, it reaches 30% of inpatient with hyperglycemia at presentation. Conclusion: DKA is a life-threatening complication, and it became worse when it is related to COVID19. The incidence of DKA and mortality related to COVID19 increased when DKA occurs for T2DM subjects. A more prospective study is warranted and a longer duration of the study to establish the accurate incidence and mortality rate.","Almistehi, Wael Mohammad; Alturki, Abdulrahman Mohammed; Bukhari, Bashear Adnan",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090118/,646

It was speculated that this population could be a risk group. The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of SARS-CoV2 infection, the impact of initiation/change of IBD therapy and its morbidity and mortality, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal. METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study. Patients with IBD followed at a Gastroenterology Department in an area with a high incidence rate of SARS-CoV2 were included, from 01/03/2020 to 31/08/2020. Data was obtained through telephonic appointments, hospital inpatients admissions, Emergency Department Service and Day Hospital episodes. RESULTS: 335 patients were included, 194 female, with a mean age of 47.4 years (18–88). 200 had Crohn’s disease (CD), 132 Ulcerative Colitis, 3 unclassified colitis. 320 were on therapy (95.5%): salicylates n=230 (71.9%), systemic corticosteroids n=34 (10.6%) (18 started during the pandemic), thiopurines/methotrexate n=117 (36.6%) (8 started in this period), biological n=148 (46.3%) (14 started in this period). 7 patients (2.2%) triple immunosuppressed. 75 patients had disease in remission, 232 mild/moderate, 28 severe disease (requiring hospitalization). SARS-CoV2 infection was observed in 3 patients (incidence rate: 0.89%), treated as an outpatient basis. 2 male, mean age 58 years, 2 with CD. Comorbidities: 0: n = 1; 2: n = 1; 4: n = 1. 2 patients were on salicylates and one on adalimumab (monotherapy, before the pandemic). There were no deaths. CONCLUSION: All patients started or maintained their IBD therapy according to current international guidelines. A significantly higher incidence of COVID-19 infection than that of the local and Portuguese population in general has not been documented. According to our preliminary results, the population with IBD does not appear to be a risk group for acquiring infection or having a severe course of the disease.","Martins Figueiredo, L; Correia, F; Rafael, M A; Lourenço, L; Oliveira, A M; Branco, J C; Santos, L; Martins, A",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194635/,646

The second proposal outlines the wider management requirements of a funding body for the ethical review and monitoring of funded projects to ensure adherence to the proposed ethical strategies in the applicants Trustworthy AI Statement. The anticipated outcome for such proposals being employed would be to create a ‘stop and think’ section during the project planning and application procedure requiring applicants to implement the methods for the ethically aligned design of AI.

55049,Development of an In‐Person Dissection Based Learning Environment for Medical and Dental Gross Anatomy Students during a Pandemic,2021-05-14,"Biofilms not only protect bacteria and Candida species from antibiotics, but they also promote the emergence of drug-resistant strains, making eradication more challenging. As a result, novel antimicrobial agents to counteract biofilm formation are desperately needed. In this study, Terminalia catappa leaf extract (TCE) was used to optimize the TCE-capped silver nanoparticles (TCE-AgNPs) via a one-pot single-step method. Varied concentrations of TCE have yielded different sized AgNPs. The physico-chemical characterization of TCE-AgNPs using UV-Vis, SEM, TEM, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy have confirmed the formation of nanostructures, their shape and size and plausible role of TCE bio-active compounds, most likely involved in the synthesis as well as stabilization of NPs, respectively. TCE-AgNPs have been tested for antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Candida albicans using various microbiological protocols. TCE-Ag-NPs−3 significantly inhibits biofilm formation of MDR-PA, MRSA, and C. albicans by 73.7, 69.56, and 63.63%, respectively, at a concentration of 7.8 µg/mL, as determined by crystal violet microtiter assay. Furthermore, SEM micrograph shows that TCE-AgNPs significantly inhibit the colonization and adherence of biofilm forming cells; individual cells with loss of cell wall and membrane integrity were also observed, suggesting that the biofilm architecture and EPS matrix were severely damaged. Moreover, TEM and SEM images showed that TCE-AgNPs brutally damaged the cell wall and membranes of MDR-PA, MRSA, and C. albicans. Additionally, extreme ultrastructural changes such as deformation, disintegration, and separation of cell wall and membrane from the cells, have also been observed, indicating significant loss of membrane and cell wall integrity, which eventually led to cell death. Overall, the research revealed a simple, environmentally friendly, and low-cost method for producing colloidal TCE-AgNPs with promising applications in advanced clinical settings against broad-spectrum biofilm-forming antibiotic-resistant bacteria and candida strains.","Ansari, Mohammad Azam; Kalam, Abul; Al-Sehemi, Abdullah G.; Alomary, Mohammad N.; AlYahya, Sami; Aziz, Mohammad Kashif; Srivastava, Shekhar; Alghamdi, Saad; Akhtar, Sultan; Almalki, Hussain D.; Adil, Syed F.; Khan, Mujeeb; Hatshan, Mohammad R.",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8234839/,646
55335,Conceptualising SEL in the Cross-Cultural Spaces of Primary Schools in Aotearoa New Zealand,2021-07-02,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a highly severe and virulent viral disease of zoonotic origin, caused by a tick-born CCHF virus (CCHFV). The virus is endemic in many countries and has a mortality rate between 10% and 40%. As there is no licensed vaccine or therapeutic options available to treat CCHF, the present study was designed to focus on application of modern computational approaches to propose a multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) expressing antigenic determinants prioritized from the CCHFV genome. Integrated computational analyses revealed the presence of 9 immunodominant epitopes from Nucleoprotein (N), RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Glycoprotein N (Gn/G2), and Glycoprotein C (Gc/G1). Together these epitopes were observed to cover 99.74% of the world populations. The epitopes demonstrated excellent binding affinity for the B- and T-cell reference set of alleles, the high antigenic potential, non-allergenic nature, excellent solubility, zero percent toxicity and interferon-gamma induction potential. The epitopes were engineered into an MEV through suitable linkers and adjuvating with an appropriate adjuvant molecule. The recombinant vaccine sequence revealed all favorable physicochemical properties allowing the ease of experimental analysis in vivo and in vitro. The vaccine 3D structure was established ab initio. Furthermore, the vaccine displayed excellent binding affinity for critical innate immune receptors: TLR2 (−14.33 kcal/mol) and TLR3 (−6.95 kcal/mol). Vaccine binding with these receptors was dynamically analyzed in terms of complex stability and interaction energetics. Finally, we speculate the vaccine sequence reported here has excellent potential to evoke protective and specific immune responses subject to evaluation of downstream experimental analysis.","Tahir Ul Qamar, Muhammad; Ismail, Saba; Ahmad, Sajjad; Mirza, Muhammad Usman; Abbasi, Sumra Wajid; Ashfaq, Usman Ali; Chen, Ling-Ling",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8242340/,646
55431,Civic education as an antidote to inequalities in political participation? New evidence from English secondary education,2021-07-03,"Die Chemo-Immuntherapie ist der Standard in der Erstlinienbehandlung von CLL-Patienten ohne del17p- oder TP 53-Mutation; körperlich fitte Patienten werden mit Fludarabin, Cyclophosphamid und Rituximab (FCR)1 behandelt. Aufgrund des hohen Risikos von schweren Neutropenien und Infektionen mit FCR muss bei Patienten im Alter von >65 Jahren Bendamustin und Rituximab (BR) in Betracht gezogen werden. Diese konventionellen Chemo-Immuntherapien sind jedoch mit Nebenwirkungen verbunden, die durch die eher unspezifische Wirkungsweise der Chemotherapie verursacht werden. Es besteht daher ein dringender Bedarf an Alternativen, insbesondere an chemotherapiefreien Regimen. In der Erstlinienbehandlung von älteren Patienten mit CLL und Begleiterkrankungen ist der Anti-CD20-Antikörper Obinutuzumab die neue Standardtherapie. In der CLL11-Studie erwies sich die Kombination von Obinutuzumab mit Chlorambucil als sicher und führte zu deutlich verbesserten Ansprechraten und PFS-Zeiten im Vergleich zu Chlorambucil allein oder kombiniert mit Rituximab. Der BCL2-Antagonist Venetoclax (GDC-0199/ABT-199) zeigte bei Patienten mit rezidivierter und refraktärer CLL eine auffällige Aktivität mit Tumorlysesyndrom als dosislimitierender Toxizität. 400mg Venetoclax wurde als eine sichere und wirksame Dosis ermittelt. Mehrere Patienten, die mit der Kombination aus Venetoclax und Rituximab bei rezidivierter refraktärer CLL behandelt wurden, erreichten sogar MRD-Negativität. Die FDA hat Venetoclax am 12. April 2016 für die Behandlung der rezidivierten CLL mit 17p/TP53 zugelassen. Daher haben Venetoclax plus CD20-Antikörper-basierte Kombinationen das Potenzial, in der Erstlinientherapie der CLL höhere Raten an MRD-Negativität zu erzielen und gleichzeitig niedrigere Raten an Toxizitäten zu induzieren, sodass eine Chemotherapie ersetzt werden könnte. Darüber hinaus zeigten Venetoclax und Obinutuzumab in einer präklinischen Studie an einem murinen Non-Hodgkin-Lymphom-Xenograft-Modell eine synergistische Aktivität und in einem CLL-Lymphknotenmodell eine additive Aktivität. Die Kombination scheint in der Erstlinienbehandlung von CLL-Patienten mit koexistierenden Erkrankungen verträglich zu sein, während das Toxizitätsprofil beider Medikamente mit dem der derzeit in der Behandlung der CLL eingesetzten Chemotherapien vergleichbar ist. Daher sollte in der GAIA/CLL13-Studie geprüft werden, ob Rituximab durch Obinutuzumab in Kombination mit Venetoclax ersetzt werden kann. Ibrutinib, ein selektiver, irreversibler, niedermolekularer Inhibitor der Bruton-Tyrosinkinase (BTK), zeigte ein hervorragendes Ansprechen und ein sicheres Toxizitätsprofil auch in Kombination mit BR. Ibrutinib ist sowohl für die Behandlung der rezidivierten CLL als auch für die Erstlinientherapie der CLL von der FDA und EMA zugelassen (29. April 2016). Die Kombination von Ibrutinib und Venetoclax zeigte Synergie in primären CLL-Zellen. Folglich ist das Ziel der aktuellen Studie zu evaluieren, ob die Chemo-Immuntherapie in der Erstlinienbehandlung von körperlich fitten Patienten bei CLL durch Kombinationen dieser zielgerichteten Medikamente mit Anti-CD20-Antikörpern ersetzt werden kann.

Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have been identified as the two major types of IBD. Currently, most of the drugs for IBD used commonly in the clinic have adverse reactions, and only a few drugs present long-lasting treatment effects. Moreover, issues of drug resistance and disease recurrence are frequent and difficult to resolve. Together, these issues cause difficulties in treating patients with IBD. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of IBD is of significance. In this context, research on natural compounds exhibiting anti-inflammatory activity could be a novel approach to developing effective therapeutic strategies for IBD. Phytochemicals such as astragalus polysaccharide (APS), quercetin, limonin, ginsenoside Rd, luteolin, kaempferol, and icariin are reported to be effective in IBD treatment. In brief, natural compounds with anti-inflammatory activities are considered important candidate drugs for IBD treatment. The present review discusses the potential of certain natural compounds and their synthetic derivatives in the prevention and treatment of IBD.","Duan, Linshan; Cheng, Shuyu; Li, Long; Liu, Yanling; Wang, Dan; Liu, Guoyan",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8316996/,646

The overarching aim of the project was to facilitate a re-energising of adult religious education and faith development in Ireland. Working amongst local faith communities with an academic research focus, an area of interest that has emerged is how the insights gained from AREFD project can contribute to initial teacher education, particularly involving students preparing for employment as post-primary religious educators. This paper will outline some of the key themes that emerged from the data gathered in phase two of the AREFD project as it pertains to the initial teacher education (ITE) of religious educators. In phase two, a total of fourteen semi-structured interviews/focus groups were conducted between December 2019 and April 2021, featuring twenty-two people from across the island of Ireland who have a wealth of experience in AREFD across diverse contexts. The purpose of these interviews was to gather together the rich insights from the depth of experience of the interviewees on practicalities and possibilities central to adult religious education. The contexts in which they have worked are all pertinent to both the post-primary Religious Education curriculum in the Republic of Ireland and wider related learning experiences, in Ireland and beyond. Four key findings from this phase of the AREFD project are reported upon in this paper: the specific realm of AREFD as distinct from school-based religious education and catechesis; the need for intentional investment in AREFD; the physicality of religion; collaboration, communication and connection. These findings may contribute to the reflections of and course development by initial teacher education providers as they seek to offer the highest quality opportunities to their students, in the understanding that their students are adults themselves and that education is a lifelong endeavour.","Sweetman, Bernadette",j,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8475302/,646

A new metal artifacts reduction prototype algorithm has been used to minimize these artifacts. The application of this new metal artifacts reduction algorithm was evaluated for flat panel detector CT imaging performed in a routine clinical setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS Flat panel detector CT images were obtained from 59 patients immediately following cerebral endovascular procedures or as surveillance imaging for cerebral endovascular or surgical procedures previously performed. The images were independently evaluated by 7 physicians for metal artifacts reduction on a 3-point scale at 2 locations: immediately adjacent to the metallic implant and 3 cm away from it. The number of visible vessels before and after metal artifacts reduction correction was also evaluated within a 3-cm radius around the metallic implant. RESULTS The metal artifacts reduction algorithm was applied to the 59 flat panel detector CT datasets without complications. The metal artifacts in the reduction-corrected flat panel detector CT images were significantly reduced in the area immediately adjacent to the implanted metal object (P = .05) and in the area 3 cm away from the metal object (P = .03). The average number of visible vessel segments increased from 4.07 to 5.29 (P = .1235) after application of the metal artifacts reduction algorithm to the flat panel detector CT images. CONCLUSIONS Metal artifacts reduction is an effective method to improve flat panel detector CT images degraded by metal artifacts. Metal artifacts are significantly decreased by the metal artifacts reduction algorithm, and there was a trend toward increased vessel-segment visualization.","Stidd, D A; Theessen, H; Deng, Y; Li, Y; Scholz, B; Rohkohl, C; Jhaveri, M D; Moftakhar, R; Chen, M; Lopes, D K",AJNR.

We screened 693 European and African shrews for hepatitis B virus (HBV) homologs to elucidate the enigmatic genealogy of HBV. Shrews host HBVs at low prevalence (2.5%) across a broad geographic and host range. The phylogenetically divergent shrew HBVs comprise separate species termed crowned shrew HBV (CSHBV) and musk shrew HBV (MSHBV), each containing distinct genotypes. Recombination events across host orders, evolutionary reconstructions, and antigenic divergence of shrew HBVs corroborated ancient origins of mammalian HBVs dating back about 80 million years. Resurrected CSHBV replicated in human hepatoma cells, but human- and tupaia-derived primary hepatocytes were resistant to hepatitis D viruses pseudotyped with CSHBV surface proteins. Functional characterization of the shrew sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp), CSHBV/MSHBV surface peptide binding patterns, and infection experiments revealed lack of Ntcp-mediated entry of shrew HBV. Contrastingly, HBV entry was enabled by the shrew Ntcp. Shrew HBVs universally showed mutations in their genomic preCore domains impeding hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) production and resembling those observed in HBeAg-negative human HBV. Deep sequencing and in situ hybridization suggest that HBeAg-negative shrew HBVs cause intense hepatotropic monoinfections and low within-host genomic heterogeneity. Geographical clustering and low MSHBV/CSHBV-specific seroprevalence suggest focal transmission and high virulence of shrew HBVs. HBeAg negativity is thus an ancient HBV infection pattern, whereas Ntcp usage for entry is not evolutionarily conserved. Shrew infection models relying on CSHBV/MSHBV revertants and human HBV will allow comparative assessments of HBeAg-mediated HBV pathogenesis, entry, and species barriers.","Rasche, Andrea; Lehmann, Felix; König, Alexander; Goldmann, Nora; Corman, Victor M; Moreira-Soto, Andres; Geipel, Andreas; van Riel, Debby; Vakulenko, Yulia A; Sander, Anna-Lena; Niekamp, Hauke; Kepper, Ramona; Schlegel, Mathias; Akoua-Koffi, Chantal; Souza, Breno F C D; Sahr, Foday; Olayemi, Ayodeji; Schulze, Vanessa; Petraityte-Burneikiene, Rasa; Kazaks, Andris; Lowjaga, Kira A A T; Geyer, Joachim; Kuiken, Thijs; Drosten, Christian; Lukashev, Alexander N; Fichet-Calvet, Elisabeth; Ulrich, Rainer G; Glebe, Dieter; Drexler, Jan Felix",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1908072116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31371507/,646

Unlike other coronaviruses, this novel pathogen may cause unusual contagious pain which results in viral pneumonia, serious heart problems, and even death. Researchers worldwide are continuously striving to develop a cure for this highly infective disease, yet there are no well-defined absolute treatments available at present. Several vaccination drives with emergency use authorisation vaccines are being done across many countries, however, their long term efficacy and side-effects study are yet to be done. The research community is analysing the situation by collecting the datasets from various sources. Healthcare professionals must thoroughly analyse the situation, devise preventive measures for this pandemic, and even develop possible drug combinations. Various analytical and statistical models have been developed, however, their outcome rate is prolonged. Thus, modern science stresses on the application of state-of-the-art methods in this combat against COVID-19. The application of Artificial intelligence (AI), and AI-driven tools are emerging as effective tools, especially with X-Ray and CT-Scan imaging data of infected subjects, infection trend predictions etc. The high efficacy of these AI systems can be observed in terms of highly accurate results, i.e. >95%, as reported in various studies. AI-driven tools are being used in COVID diagnostic, therapeutics, trend prediction, drug design and prevention to help fight against this pandemic. This paper aims to provide a deep insight into the comprehensive literature about AI and AI-driven tools in this battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.

How we can re-design the concept of Public Health in relation to the built environment and the contemporary cities? METHODS According to the previous statements and scenario, aim of this paper is to integrate the Urban Health strategic objectives, focusing the possible responses, both immediate and medium-long term, to the current environmental, social, and economic aspects of the ""period"" of physical distancing. Results. Immediate Actions are 01. program the flexibility of city schedules; 02. plan a smart and sustainable mobility network; 03. define a neighborhood services' plan; 04. develop a digitization of the urban context, promoting the smart communities; 05. re-think the accessibility to the places of culture and tourism. Medium-long term Actions are 06. design the indoor flexibility of domestic living spaces; 07. re-think building typologies, fostering the presence of semi-private or collective spaces; 08. renovate the basic care services' network; 09. integrate the existing environmental emergency plans, with those related to the health emergencies; 10. improve stakeholders' awareness of the factors affecting Public Health in the cities.

76685,Universal Masking in Hospitals in the Covid-19 Era.,2020-04-01,"Most emerging pathogens of humans can infect multiple host species (Woolhouse & Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005). This simple fact has motivated multiple large-scale, comparative analyses of the drivers of pathogen sharing and zoonotic pathogen richness among hosts as well as the factors determining the zoonotic potential of pathogens themselves. However, most of this work focuses on viruses, limiting a broader understanding of how host range varies within and between pathogen groups. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Shaw et al. (2020) compile a comprehensive data set of host-pathogen associations across viruses and bacteria and test whether previous patterns observed in the former occur in the latter. They find most viruses and bacteria are specialists, and viruses are more likely to be generalists; however, generalist bacteria encompass multiple host orders, whereas viral sharing occurs more within host orders. Lastly, the authors demonstrate that many factors previously identified as predictors of zoonotic richness for viruses occur for bacteria and that host phylogenetic similarity is a primary determinant of cross-species transmission. However, pathogen sharing with humans was more common and more weakly related to phylogenetic distance to Homo sapiens for bacteria compared to viruses, suggesting the former could pose greater spillover risks across host orders. This work represents a key advance in our understanding of host specificity and pathogen sharing beyond viruses.","Becker, Daniel J; Albery, Gregory F",Molecular ecology,https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803760/,646

81050,ISNO Position Statement on Treatment Guidance in Neuro-oncology During Pandemics.,2020,"Aims Many experimental studies have reported that intra-arrest cooling during cardiac arrest is a promising treatment to mitigate brain injury. However, there is no clinically established method for cooling the brain during cardiac arrest. We hypothesized that, as blood flow in the lungs must be very slow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the blood could be cooled by ventilating the lungs with cooled oxygen like a radiator, and that this cooled blood would in turn cool the brain. The aim of this study was to develop equipment to cool oxygen for this purpose and to confirm its safety on a group of volunteers. Methods We developed new equipment that cools oxygen by running it through a vinyl chloride coil submerged in a bottle of water and frozen at -80°C. Using this equipment, seven volunteers were given oxygen by mask, and their blood pressure, heart rate, and peripheral saturation of oxygen were measured. The temperature in the mask was also measured. Results This equipment was able to decrease the temperature in the mask to -5°C at the Jackson Rees circuit for an oxygen flow of 10 L/min. Among the volunteer group, vital signs were unchanged and the temperature in the mask decreased from 30.1 ± 2.6°C (mean ± standard deviation) to 15.9 ± 9.6°C.

92101,Learning environments for interprofessional education: A micro-ethnography of sociomaterial assemblages in team-based learning.,2020-09-05,"BACKGROUND Emergency physicians and anesthesiologists need accurate estimates of stroke volume when massive unexpected hemorrhage occurs. Using an animal model of hemorrhagic shock under general anesthesia, we hypothesized that the pulse pressure-heart rate ratio (PP/HR) would be an accurate marker of stroke volume changes during hemorrhage and resuscitation. METHODS In 16 swine under bispectral index-controlled, intravenous propofol-remifentanil anesthesia, pressure-controlled hemorrhagic shock was induced to achieve 30 mm Hg of mean arterial pressure, after which treatment was randomized to fluid (HES, n = 4), norepinephrine (NE, n = 4), both (HES + NE, n = 4), or neither (control, n = 4). Pulmonary artery thermodilution continuous cardiac output, stroke volume, and central arterial pressures were recorded at baseline (T0), after 30 minutes (T30) and 60 (T60) minutes of hemorrhage, during treatment (T90 and T120) and after blood retransfusion (T180). RESULTS At T60, blood withdrawal was 995 (301) mL (38 [8] mL/kg), resulting in a 70% decrease in stroke volume and a 3.3-fold decrease in PP/HR (each p < 0.01). When stroke volume data pointed at T0, T30 and T60 were plotted against the various hemodynamic variables under study, the PP/HR ratio exhibited the strongest relationship to stroke volume (r = 0.72). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve set to detect a 15% stroke volume decrease was larger for PP/HR (0.95 [0.94-0.97]) than for mean arterial pressure (0.91 [0.89-0.93]) (p < 0.013). During resuscitation in the HES and NE groups, correlation coefficients were significantly higher between stroke volume and PP/HR (0.75 [0.63-0.84] and 0.79 [0.67-0.86]) than between stroke volume and mean arterial pressure (0.52 [0.32-0.67], p = 0.042, and 0.49 [0.28-0.65], p = 0.0018, respectively). CONCLUSION The PP/HR ratio was strongly related to stroke volume during hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation in anesthetized swine.","Pottecher, Julien; Chemla, Denis; Xavier, Lorenço; Liu, Ngai; Chazot, Thierry; Marescaux, Jacques; Fischler, Marc; Diemunsch, Pierre; Duranteau, Jacques",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/ta.0b013e31828c3565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23694870/,646

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of a modified PEI method combined with MWA for the treatment of symptomatic, predominantly cystic and benign thyroid nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study included 201 patients who underwent treatment in our department between April 2015 and August 2018. Predominantly cystic thyroid nodules were treated by the modified PEI procedure, which included short-term boiling ethanol ablation (STBEA) and was combined with MWA. Complications, the volume reduction ratio (VRR), symptoms and cosmetic scores were recorded at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment and every 6 months thereafter. RESULTS No major complications were observed during or after the treatment. Ten patients (4.8%) experienced temporary voice change, which resolved within 3 months. Of 200 (97.6%) out of 205 nodules showed significant volume reduction at the final follow-up. Recurrence occurred for only 5 (2.4%) nodules. The mean thyroid nodule volume decreased from 17.40 ± 3.21 mL at baseline to 1.17 ± 0.37 mL at 12 months. The greatest VRR was observed within the first 3 months after treatment. CONCLUSIONS The modified PEI method combined with MWA is safe and effective for the treatment of predominantly cystic benign thyroid nodules and provides a shorter operating time and lower recurrence rate than traditional treatments.","Su, Chen; Liu, Yu-Jiang; Qian, Lin-Xue","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2021.1924407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180768/,646

The safety and efficacy of using flow-diverting stents for vertebral artery (VA) aneurysms is not well defined. OBJECTIVE To examine the fate of covering the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) in patients undergoing placement of a flow-diverting stent for VA aneurysm. METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent placement of a Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) for treatment of an aneurysm of the V4 segment of the VA between April 2012 and June 2015 at our institution were retrospectively evaluated. Angiograms were reviewed to determine the patency of the PICA when the vessel origin was covered by the PED. RESULTS 11 patients with VA aneurysms who underwent treatment with the PED were identified. In each case the device covered the origin of the PICA. Follow-up angiography in eight patients demonstrated thrombosis of the aneurysm with patency of the PICA. CONCLUSIONS Flow-diverting stents can be used for the treatment of VA aneurysms. When appropriately sized to the vessel wall and positioned in the VA, the device may cover the origin of the PICA without impairing flow through the branching artery.","Mazur, Marcus D; Kilburg, Craig; Wang, Victor; Taussky, Philipp",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-012040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26491041/,646

To investigate the potential of RIT with lutetium 177 (177Lu)-labeled G250, we conducted a protein dose escalation study and subsequently an RIT study in mice with intraperitoneally growing ccRCC lesions. Mice with intraperitoneal xenografts were injected with 1, 3, 10, 30, or 100 μg of G250 labeled with 10 MBq indium 111 (111In) to determine the optimal protein dose. The optimal protein dose determined with imaging and biodistribution studies was used in a subsequent RIT experiment in three groups of 10 mice with intraperitoneal SK-RC-52 tumors. One group received 13 MBq 177LU-DOTA-G250, a control group received 13 MBq nonspecific 177LU-MOPC21, and the second control group was not treated and received 20 MBq 111In-DOTA-G250. The optimal G250 protein dose to target ccRCC in this model was 10 μg G250. Treatment with 13 MBq 177LU-DOTA-G250 was well tolerated and resulted in significantly prolonged median survival (139 days) compared to controls (49-53 days, p = .015), indicating that RIT has potential in this metastatic ccRCC model.","Muselaers, Constantijn H J; Oosterwijk, Egbert; Bos, Desirée L; Oyen, Wim J G; Mulders, Peter F A; Boerman, Otto C",Molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.2310/7290.2014.00008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28650289/,646

Preoperative three-dimensional computed tomography showed that the A2 is composed of descending A2 and ascending A2, branch of V6 coursed to V2 and B1a originated from B2 and B1b from B3. Two separate segmentectomies were subsequently scheduled. Pulmonary vessel division was performed with VSS after proximal ligation. Intersegmental division by VSS and electrocautery was performed with the use of inflation-deflation demarcation line and the pulmonary veins along the intersegmental plane (V2a and V2c for segment 2 and V6b and V6c for segment 6) as guides to confirm the intersegmental plane after pulmonary artery and bronchial divisions. The intraoperative frozen-section examinations revealed adenocarcinoma in situ. Two separate segmentectomies were successfully completed, with a total operative time of 240 min and blood loss of 30 ml.

As of April 31st, the reported cases of COVID-19 are three million in 186 countries. Reported case fatality has crossed 200 thousand among which more than fifty thousand has been in the USA. Most patients present with symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath following exposure to other COVID-19 patients. Respiratory manifestations predominate in patients with mild, moderate, severe illness. Imaging of patients with COVID-19 consistently reports various pulmonary parenchymal involvement. In this article we wanted to reinforce and review the various reported imaging patterns of cardiac and mediastinal involvement in COVID-19 patients. Among patients with COVID 19 who underwent various imaging of chest various cardiac findings including pericardial effusion, myocarditis, cardiomegaly has been reported. Most of these findings have been consistently reported in patients with significant acute myocardial injury, and fulminant myocarditis. Acute biventricular dysfunction has also been reported with subsequent improvement of the same following clinical improvement. Details of cardiac MRI is rather limited. In a patient with clinical presentation of acute myocarditis, biventricular myocardial interstitial edema, diffuse biventricular hypokinesia, increased ventricular wall thickness, and severe LV dysfunction has been reported. Among patients with significant clinical improvement in LV structure and function has also been documented. With increasing number of clinical cases, future imaging studies will be instrumental in identifying the various cardiac manifestations, and their relation to clinical outcome.","Mishra, Ajay Kumar; Lal, Amos; Sahu, Kamal Kant; Kranis, Mark; Sargent, Jennifer",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2020.1394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33169595/,646

Hepatectomy has become a standard treatment for patients with colorectal cancer with resectable liver metastases. The resection of liver tumors can now be done partly by laparoscopic surgery. However, metastatic tumors in the right lobe are often difficult to resect laparoscopically. Furthermore, simultaneous resection of the colorectum and liver may also be difficult. In this study, we evaluated a new method to resect both colorectal cancer and liver metastases in the right lobe by laparoscopic surgery. Two cases are presented that underwent total laparoscopic resection of a right lobe tumor, associated with laparoscopic colorectal resection. The metastatic tumor in the right lobe was first resected in the left hemi-prone position. Then, the colorectal cancer was resected in the lithotomy position. The method for resecting the right lobe liver tumor and colorectal cancer was safe and feasible. The mean duration of surgery was 443.5 min, and the mean blood loss was 158 mL. The postoperative course was uneventful. In selected patients, laparoscopic hepatectomy for right lobe synchronous metastatic tumors can be safely performed simultaneously with colorectal surgery.","Ando, Koji; Oki, Eiji; Ikeda, Tetsuo; Saeki, Hiroshi; Ida, Satoshi; Kimura, Yasue; Soejima, Yuuji; Morita, Masaru; Shirabe, Ken; Kusumoto, Tetuya; Maehara, Yoshihiko",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-013-0801-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24343172/,646

METHODS Between November 2006 and November 2009, 41 patients with a mean age of 69.6 years (range 51-86) underwent 51 bicompartmental knee arthroplasties with the Journey-Deuce knee prosthesis. All patients presented with symptomatic medial and patellofemoral compartment osteoarthritis, with intact cruciate ligaments and a preserved lateral compartment on plain radiographs and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Clinical assessment was undertaken pre-surgery and at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years post-surgery using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), EuroQol Group 5-Dimension self-reported questionnaire (EQ-5D) and maximal active range of motion (ROM). RESULTS 30 patients (37 knees) were followed-up at a mean time of 11.4 years (SD 1.1; range 10.5-14.0). Eight patients (ten knees) were deceased and three could not be contacted at final review. No major component revision was performed. Pre-operative OKS 25.4 (SD 5.2; range 15-40), knee flexion 116.4° (SD 10.3°; range 100°-140°) and EQ-5D 70.5 (SD 19.9; range 25-95). 10-year OKS 43.5 (SD 4.1; range 32-48), knee flexion 127.3° (SD 11.1°; range 105°-144°) and EQ-5D 77.4 (SD 9.3; range 60-100). The OKS (p < 0.0001), EQ-5D (p = 0.024) and active knee flexion ROM (p < 0.0001) all significantly improved from pre-surgery to 1-year post-surgery, with no further significant changes in these scores between any post-operative time period up until 10 years. 32% (7/22) of tibial and 45% (10/22) of femoral components showed progressive radiolucencies between 2 and 5-year and 10-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS This is the largest cohort of patients having undergone BCKA (with the Journey-Deuce prosthesis) with longest follow-up described in the literature. At 10 years, patients presented with significantly improved clinical outcomes, comparable to other surgical arthroplasty options. No major component revision was performed. Progressive radiolucencies were noted in 32% of tibial and 45% of femoral components without corresponding clinical signs of loosening.

Post-operative chronic pain remains an ongoing concern in about 10% of patients. Parietex ProGrip™, a polyester self-gripping mesh, has a theoretical benefit of avoiding tacks for mesh-fixation. This case series reflects our long-term experience of this technique. METHODS We conducted a retrospective case series from November 2011 to December 2017. Patients were identified through an operative Medicare Benefits Schedule item number search. Clinical documentation was reviewed with length of stay, mesh infection, chronic pain, recurrence and re-operation as primary data points. RESULTS A total of 514 patients underwent 780 laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs with self-gripping polyester mesh during this period. There were 53 female (10.3%) and 461 male patients (89.7%). Unilateral hernia repair was performed in 248 patients (48.2%) and bilateral repair in 266 patients (51.8%). Almost all repairs (779, 99.8%) were primary hernias. There were no mesh infections. Four recurrences were noted (0.51%) and three of these subsequently underwent open redo-hernia repairs (0.38%). Post-operative follow-up was up to 4.4 years. CONCLUSIONS Our series of laparoscopic groin hernia repair with self-gripping mesh demonstrate this is a safe and reliable mesh and effective technique with low recurrence rates.","Stavert, Bethany; Chan, Daniel L; Ozmen, John; Loi, Ken",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.15378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31452324/,646

There are studies demonstrating that the Brazilian ginseng (BGE) possibly increases the serum levels of testosterone and nitric oxide in mice and rats. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of its extract on male fertility and sperm quality. Male Swiss mice (n = 60) were divided into six groups. The control animals were provided 0.5 mL of water, and 0.5 mL of water containing 7 mg/kg per day (d) sildenafil citrate. Other animals were treated with BGE at 100 mg/kg/d, 200 mg/kg/d, and 400 mg/kg/d by gavage for 42 days. Finally, animals from the last group received 200 mg/kg BGE every 3 days (3-3d) by gavage for 42 days. The results showed a reduction in the number of resistant spermatids in the testis and damage to daily sperm production, culminating in a reduction in the number of epididymal spermatozoa. Although the sperm quality decreased in all experimental animals, only males treated with BGE 100 mg/kg/d showed pre and post implantation embryo losses. We concluded that BGE alters sperm viability compromising the embryonic development after implantation.","Dias, F C R; Machado-Neves, M; Lima, G D A; Martins, A L P; Menezes, T P; Melo, F C S A; Gomes, M L M; Cupertino, M C; Otoni, W C; Matta, S L P",Histology and histopathology,https://doi.org/10.14670/hh-18-244; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735026/,646

Rationally designed bacteriophage therapy can circumvent and direct evolution of AR and virulence. Vaccines and monoclonal antibodies are highlighted as immune-based treatments targeting specific P. aeruginosa antigens.

MATERIAL AND METHODS All studies that were performed to compare PETD with PEID to treat LDH and published until 31 August 2017 were acquired through a comprehensive search in various databases. A meta-analysis was performed using the Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS A total of 13 trials with 974 cases consisting of 3 randomized controlled trials, 3 prospective studies and 7 retrospective studies were included. The results suggest that patients treated with PEID experienced more significant advantages with shorter operation time, less intraoperative blood loss and less intraoperative fluoroscopy times but more complications than those treated with PETD; however, the two operative approaches did not significantly differ in terms of LDH recurrence, hospital stay, Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores and MacNab criteria at the final follow-up. CONCLUSION Based on the results of this study, although PEID may be superior to PETD in certain ways, some of its advantages have yet to be verified and the two interventions were not significantly different in terms of relief of symptoms and functional recovery. Therefore, PEID would be recommended for treating LDH especially at L5/S1 under certain conditions but a prudent attitude is necessary to choose between the two operative approaches before a large sample and high quality randomized controlled trials have been performed.","Huang, Yongjing; Yin, Jianjian; Sun, Zhenzhong; Song, Sheng; Zhuang, Yin; Liu, Xueguang; Du, Shihao; Rui, Yongjun",Der Orthopade,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00132-019-03710-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30989258/,646

The decision to choose specific equipment should be based on the protection factors and also on the overall analysis of given conditions. International scientific databases, such as Web of Science, PubMed and MedLine, were searched on May 5, 2020, with the following key words: COVID-19, respiratory protection, surgical masks, filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and disposable respirators. The differences between various respiratory protective equipment, i.e., surgical masks, respirators such as FFRs, elastomeric half-facepiece respirators, elastomeric full-facepiece respirators and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), were compared. Reusable elastomeric respirators (RERs) may provide a better adaptation to the face and may be more stable when used by healthcare providers (HCPs). Protection factors were found to be higher in FFRs compared to surgical masks. While FFRs provide a one-tenth decrease in the inhaled aerosol concentration, PAPRs diminish the inhaled aerosol up to one-twenty-fifth. Even with some full-face PAPRs and helmets, the protection factor assigned by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration can reach a value up to 1000. For HCPs, the evidence shown in this article provides an additional support for the utilization of RERs. Such equipment might be less prone to leakages, can provide a better fit, and indicates a better stability compared to disposable FFRs (N95 and similar). By providing higher protection factors, reusable elastomeric respirators are recommended to be used by HCPs under controlled cleaning and disinfection protocols.","Sozkes, Sarkis; Sozkes, Serda",International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,https://doi.org/10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33231204/,646

During viral CNS infections, however, an indiscriminate maintenance of CNS immune privilege through Treg-mediated negative regulation could prevent autoimmune sequelae but impair the control of viral replication. We analyzed in this study the impact of Tregs on the development of acute viral encephalomyelitis, T cell-mediated antiviral protection, and prevention of CNS autoimmunity following intranasal infection with the gliatropic mouse hepatitis virus strain A59. To assess the contribution of Tregs in vivo, we specifically depleted CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T cells in a diphtheria toxin-dependent manner. We found that depletion of Tregs had no impact on viral distribution and clearance and did not significantly alter virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses. However, Treg depletion led to a more severe CNS inflammation associated with neuronal damage. Dissection of the underlying immunopathological mechanisms revealed the elaborate Treg-dependent regulation of self-reactive CD4(+) T cell proliferation within the CNS-draining lymph node and downtuning of CXCR3 expression on T cells. Taken together, these results suggest that Tregs preserve CNS immune privilege through selective control of CNS-specific Th cells while keeping protective antiviral immunity fully operative.","Cervantes-Barragán, Luisa; Firner, Sonja; Bechmann, Ingo; Waisman, Ari; Lahl, Katharina; Sparwasser, Tim; Thiel, Volker; Ludewig, Burkhard",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1102422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22407917/,646

The aim of this study was to obtain patients' evaluation of their telemedicine experience. METHODS Patients who were candidates for telemedicine consultations were recruited based on their urological ailment, necessity for follow-up and comorbidity. New referrals including patients with suspicion of cancer were not candidates for telemedicine. In total, 548 patients had their appointment altered during the period from 13 March to 30 April 2020. Postal questionnaires were sent to 548 patients and 300 (54.7%) replied. RESULTS In total, 280 patient answered, 224 (80%) men and 56 (20%) women, mean age 69 years (range 18-91) of whom 180 (64.3%) had a benign and 100 (35.7%) a malignant diagnosis. Twenty (6.7%) respondents did not remember their telephone consultation and were therefore excluded. Telephone consultation satisfaction was reported by 230 (85.0%) patients, but they would not prefer video consultations over telephone consultations, and only 102 (36.4%) would prefer telephone consultations in the future. Patients' age, sex and distance to the hospital did not seem to be associated with telephone consultation satisfaction (age p = 0.17; sex p = 0.99; distance p = 0.27, respectively). In total, 226 (80.7%) were medically assessed as being at risk for COVID, but 74 (26.4%) subjectively evaluated themselves as being at risk.

144638,World leaders in covid-19 control.,2020-06-16,"Viral infection compromises specific organelles of the cell and readdresses its functional resources to satisfy the needs of the invading body. Around 70% of the coronavirus positive-sense single-stranded RNA encodes proteins involved in replication, and these viruses essentially take over the biosynthetic and transport mechanisms to ensure the efficient replication of their genome and trafficking of their virions. Some coronaviruses encode genes for ion-channel proteins - the envelope protein E (orf4a), orf3a and orf8 - which they successfully employ to take control of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex intermediate compartment or ERGIC. The E protein, which is one of the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, assembles its transmembrane protomers into homopentameric channels with mild cationic selectivity. Orf3a forms homodimers and homotetramers. Both carry a PDZ-binding domain, lending them the versatility to interact with more than 400 target proteins in infected host cells. Orf8 is a very short 29-amino-acid single-passage transmembrane peptide that forms cation-selective channels when assembled in lipid bilayers. This review addresses the contribution of biophysical and structural biology approaches that unravel different facets of coronavirus ion channels, their effects on the cellular machinery of infected cells and some structure-functional correlations with ion channels of higher organisms.","Barrantes, Francisco J","Acta crystallographica.

The validity and usability of this system in the uncontrolled real-life working environment of physically active workers are still unknown. The objective of this study was to test the discriminant validity of an artificial neural network-based method for load assessment during actual work. Nine physically active workers performed work-related tasks while wearing the sensor system. The main measure representing lumbar load was the net moment around the L5/S1 intervertebral body, estimated using a method that was based on artificial neural network and perceived workload. The mean differences (MDs) were tested using a paired t-test. During heavy tasks, the net moment (MD = 64.3 ± 13.5%, p = 0.028) and the perceived workload (MD = 5.1 ± 2.1, p < 0.001) observed were significantly higher than during the light tasks. The lumbar load had significantly higher variances during the dynamic tasks (MD = 33.5 ± 36.8%, p = 0.026) and the perceived workload was significantly higher (MD = 2.2 ± 1.5, p = 0.002) than during static tasks. It was concluded that the validity of this sensor-based system was supported because the differences in the lumbar load were consistent with the perceived intensity levels and character of the work tasks.","Roossien, Charlotte Christina; Baten, Christian Theodoor Maria; van der Waard, Mitchel Willem Pieter; Reneman, Michiel Felix; Verkerke, Gijsbertus Jacob",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s21072476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33918394/,646

What is the impact of the 2008 financial recession and the COVID-19 recession on fertility treatments and cumulative live births? DESIGN The study examined annual US natality, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention IVF cycle activity and live birth data from 1999 to 2018 encompassing 3,286,349 treatment cycles, to estimate the age-stratified reduction in IVF cycles undertaken after the 2008 financial recession, with forward quantitative modelling of IVF cycle activity and cumulative live births for 2020 to 2023. RESULTS The financial recession of 2008 caused a 4-year plateau in fertility treatments with a predicted 53,026 (95% confidence interval [CI] 49,581 to 56,471) fewer IVF cycles and 16,872 (95% CI 16,713 to 17,031) fewer live births. A similar scale of economic recession would cause 67,386 (95% CI 61,686 to 73,086) fewer IVF cycles between 2020 and 2023, with women younger than 35 years overall undertaking 22,504 (95% CI 14,320 to 30,690) fewer cycles, compared with 4445 (95% CI 3144 to 5749) fewer cycles in women over the age of 40 years. This equates to overall 25,143 (95% CI 22,408 to 27,877) fewer predicted live births from IVF, of which only 490 (95% CI 381 to 601) are anticipated to occur in women over the age of 40 years.

149500,Ventilator-associated pneumonia: current status and future recommendations.,2010,"INTRODUCTION A point prevalence study was conducted to study the epidemiology of common infections among residents in Residential Care Homes for the Elderly in Hong Kong and their associated factors. METHODS Residential Care Homes for the Elderly in Hong Kong were selected by stratified single-stage cluster random sampling. All residents aged 65 years or above from the recruited homes were surveyed. Infections were identified using standardised definitions. Demographic and health information-including medical history, immunisation record, antibiotic use, and activities of daily living (as measured by Barthel Index)-was collected by a survey team to determine any associated factors. RESULTS Data were collected from 3857 residents in 46 Residential Care Homes for the Elderly from February to May 2014. A total of 105 residents had at least one type of infection based on the survey definition. The overall prevalence of all infections was 2.7% (95% confidence interval, 2.2%-3.4%). The three most common infections were of the respiratory tract (1.3%; 95% confidence interval, 0.9%-1.9%), skin and soft tissue (0.7%; 95% confidence interval, 0.5%-1.0%), and urinary tract (0.5%; 95% confidence interval, 0.3%-0.9%). Total dependence in activities of daily living, as indicated by low Barthel Index score of 0 to 20 (odds ratio=3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-6.2), and presence of a wound or stoma (odds ratio=2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.9) were significantly associated with presence of infection. CONCLUSIONS This survey provides information about infections among residents in Residential Care Homes for the Elderly in the territory.

The present study investigated the effects of RDN on end organ damage (EOD). DESIGN The present study was a prospective cohort study (registered as NCT01427049). METHODS Uncontrolled hypertensive patients underwent a work-up prior to and one year after RDN. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was used to determine left ventricular (LV)-mass; pulse wave analysis and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were used for evaluation of central blood pressure (BP) and arterial stiffness and 24-hour urine was collected for assessment of urinary albumin excretion. The 24-hour ambulatory BP measurement (ABPM) was used to evaluate the effect of RDN on BP. RESULTS Fifty-four patients gave informed consent for study participation. Mean age was 58 ± 10 years, 50% were male. One year after RDN, mean ABPM decreased by 7 ± 18/5 ± 11 mm Hg (p = 0.01/p < 0.01). In the patients followed-up in a standardised fashion ABPM decreased by 5 ± 18/4 ± 12 mm Hg (n = 34; p = 0.11/p = 0.09). Mean body surface area indexed LV-mass decreased by 3.3 ± 11.5 g/m(2) (corresponding to a 3 ± 11% reduction; p = 0.09). PWV increased by 2.9 (-2.2 to +6.1) m/s (p = 0.04). Augmentation index corrected for 75 beats per min did not change (median increase 3.0 (-7 to +17) mm Hg; p = 0.89). Urinary albumin excretion did not change during follow-up (mean decrease 10 ± 117 mg/24 hour; p = 0.61). CONCLUSION In the current study, we observed a modest effect from renal denervation. Moreover, RDN did not result in a statistical significant effect on end organ damage 12 months after treatment.","Verloop, Willemien L; Vink, Eva E; Spiering, Wilko; Blankestijn, Peter J; Doevendans, Pieter A; Bots, Michiel L; Vonken, Evert-jan; Voskuil, Michiel; Leiner, Tim",European journal of preventive cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487314556003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25326543/,646

This research investigated whether and when an employee's perceived COVID-19 crisis strength affected his or her work engagement and taking charge at work. In a time-lagged field study of health workers on the coronavirus frontline (Study 1), we found that when work meaningfulness was lower, a health worker's perceived COVID-19 crisis strength exerted a more negative effect on his or her work engagement and taking charge at work. In a longitudinal field experiment (Study 2), we collaborated with a hospital to carry out two organizational interventions based on event system theory and work meaningfulness r esearch. The interventions significantly decreased perceived COVID-19 crisis strength and increased work meaningfulness for medical staff in an intensive care unit (ICU), who were tasked with caring for COVID-19 patients in critical condition.

163152,Student opinions regarding microsoft teams app used as an educational online learning environment during pandemic process,2021,"Background High-dimensional omics datasets provide valuable resources to determine the causal role of molecular traits in mediating the path from genotype to phenotype. Making use of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) summary statistics, we developed a multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) framework to quantify the connectivity between three omics layers (DNA methylome (DNAm), transcriptome and proteome) and their cascading causal impact on complex traits and diseases. Results Evaluating 50 complex traits, we found that on average 37.8% (95% CI: [36.0%-39.5%]) of DNAm-to-trait effects were mediated through transcripts in the cis-region, while only 15.8% (95% CI: [11.9%-19.6%]) are mediated through proteins in cis. DNAm sites typically regulate multiple transcripts, and while found to predominantly decrease gene expression, this was only the case for 53.4% across ≈ 47,000 significant DNAm-transcript pairs. The average mediation proportion for transcript-to-trait effects through proteins (encoded for by the assessed transcript or located in trans) was estimated to be 5.27% (95%CI: [4.11%-6.43%]). Notable differences in the transcript and protein QTL architectures were detected with only 22% of protein levels being causally driven by their corresponding transcript levels. Several regulatory mechanisms were hypothesized including an example where cg10385390 (chr1:8’022’505) increases the risk of irritable bowel disease by reducing PARK7 transcript and protein expression. Conclusions The proposed integrative framework identified putative causal chains through omics layers providing a powerful tool to map GWAS signals. Quantification of causal effects between successive layers indicated that molecular mechanisms can be more complex than what the central dogma of biology would suggest.","Sadler, Marie C.; Auwerx, Chiara; Porcu, Eleonora; Kutalik, Zoltán",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.462396,646

The confinement of populations, the blocking of logistics chains, the stoppage of economic activity imposed by this COVID-19 health crisis, have highlighted the vulnerability of value chains. Nowadays, the limits of the ""just in time"" strategy can be observed. To remedy this, it is necessary to understand the characteristics of this economic crisis in its current context. In addition, the pandemic with its effect in prolonged waves caused a more or less severe recession depending on the country, which led to a drop in global energy demand by 6% and an 8% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. Also, the forecasts are not optimistic for the water sector, which is no exception. Climate change models indicate that precipitation could decrease by more than 20% by 2050. The challenge for Algeria in the years to come is to adapt to a decrease in renewable water resources. The country must mobilize unconventional water resources (desalination and reuse of wastewater) which will be a strategic component in water management. In addition, the development of unconventional resources leads to an increase in electrical energy demand of 12% by year, which must count in the national energy balance.

The acceptability to patients of continuing such interventions beyond the pandemic as a measure to prevent exacerbations is not known. Method: An online survey of people living with respiratory disease was created by the Asthma UK British Lung Foundation Partnership. People were asked what infection control measures they expected to continue themselves, and what they thought should be policy for the population more generally in the future, once the COVID19 pandemic had subsided. Results: 4442 people completed the survey: 3627 with asthma, 258 with bronchiectasis and 557 with COPD. Regarding personal behaviour, 79.5% would continue increased handwashing, 68.6% social distancing indoors, 46.9% would continue to wear a face covering in indoor public places (45.7% on public transport), and 59.3% would avoid friends and family who were unwell with a respiratory infection. 45.6% wanted healthcare professionals to continue wearing a mask when seeing patients. 60.7% thought that face coverings should continue to be worn by everyone in indoor public spaces during the flu season. Women and older people were, in general, more cautious. Conclusion: People living with airways diseases are supportive of infection control measures to reduce the risk of exacerbations and such measures should be considered for inclusion in guidelines.

This situation requires medical personnel to work extraordinarily to treat COVID-19 patients with very high risk of transmission. For this reason, this study aimed to helping medical personnel handle COVID-19 patients through robotic technology. The development method in this study is proposed as a way to develop robots to serve patients in isolation rooms controlled at a distance away from other rooms. From technical testing, the movement of the robot with a load of 12.59 kg only experienced a speed slowdown which was not too significant, namely at 0.43s with an average percentage of slowdown of 8.96%. The accuracy of the proximity sensor testing is close to perfect with an accuracy percentage of 99.62%. The robot control distance was monitored and running well. Also, the increase in motor temperature is not too large, supported by measurement results of 32.13%. From non-technical testing, based on the test results of the feasibility test of all respondents with 25 indicators reached a feasibility level of 91.46%. In other words, healthcare mobile robots developed for helping medical personnel in dealing with COVID-19 patients are very feasible to be applied in hospitals. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

(Special Issue: The impact of COVID-19 on hospitality and tourism education.),2021,"IntroductionIn pandemic conditions, obsessive rituals such as hygiene can be considered adaptive together with the extreme measures that must be followed to avoid contagion by Covid-19, we suggest that the stress the pandemic has caused may result in an increase in the percentage of OCD symptom and severity in the Chilean population at Santiago.ObjectivesStudy OCD symptoms and their severity during a contamination pandemic such as COVID and quarentine, and compare them to national reports of OCD prevalence in Chile. We hypothesize that OCD symptoms would be higher in these stressfull situations.MethodsAn online voluntary and annonymous survey was carried out asking about sociodemographic variables and the Y-BOCKS scale, an OCD symptom severity scale version already validated in Chile.Results497 completed the survey and Y-BOCKS scale. 241 people which is equivalent to 48% of the sample presented scores that classified them as having OCD.Off these 30% had mild, 12% moderate and 7% severe symptoms. 85% of them were inquarantine for more than 2 months.ConclusionsThese results are above the 2% of OCD reported at the national level. These percentages may be due to a smaller sample size, but even so, the high percentages of people with symptoms during COVID and those who were in quarentine or lockdown for 2 months or more, stand out. Future analysis and research needs to be made. We ask ourselves wether is Covid, quarentine, or both and of so, how much each pf these contribute to these high percentages of OCD symptoms observed.","Zarate, C.; Binder, P.; Valdivia, V.; Stappung, H.; Arce, J.

The NIOSH test certifying the N95 rating, however, poorly simulates aerosols in healthcare settings, limiting our understanding of the exposure risk for healthcare workers wearing these masks, especially reprocessed ones. We used experimental conditions that simulated the sizes, densities and airflow properties of infectious aerosols in healthcare settings. We analyzed the penetration and leakage of aerosols through pristine and reprocessed N95 respirators. Seven reprocessing methods were investigated. Our findings suggest that pristine and properly reprocessed N95 respirators effectively limit exposure to infectious aerosols, but that care must be taken to avoid the elucidated degradation mechanisms and limit noncompliant wear.","Chen, Paul Z; Ngan, Aldrich; Manson, Niclas; Maynes, Jason T; Borschel, Gregory H; Rotstein, Ori D; Gu, Frank X",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.20094821,646

So far, due to a scarcity of data and methodological shortcomings, these efforts have lacked the system-level view of treating sidewalks as a network. Here, we leverage sidewalk data from ten cities in three continents, to first analyse the distribution of sidewalk and roadbed geometries, and find that cities present an unbalanced distribution of public space, favouring automobiles at the expense of pedestrians. Next, we connect these geometries to build a sidewalk network –adjacent, but irreducible to the road network. Finally, we compare a no-intervention scenario with a shared-effort heuristic, in relation to the performance of sidewalk infrastructures to guarantee physical distancing. The heuristic prevents the sidewalk connectivity breakdown, while preserving the road network's functionality. While public space is traditionally shared by pedestrian and cars, the distancing measures imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic have underlined the need for wider pedestrian spaces. Here, the authors take a complex network approach to analyze sidewalk data from cities across the world to evidence a strong unbalance in the space distribution between cars and pedestrian, and propose a strategy to improve urban walkability within a socially distancing context and without compromising road traffic.

Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database. Materials and Methods: We conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FAERS database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model. Results: We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited. There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation. Conclusion: Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.","Sato, K.; Mano, T.; Iwata, A.; Toda, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.10.20061358v1?rss=1,646

In this scenario, the approach to oncological diseases becomes a challenge, considering the risk of progression of cancer disease and death due to delay in diagnosis and treatment. Faced with this exceptional situation, coloproctology services have been forced to change their routine to adapt to the new reality, considering risks and benefits in the conduct of these patients. Thus, the experience of the coloproctology service at the Santa Casa de São Paulo, São Paulo, state of São Paulo, Brazil, during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic is described, evaluating the possibility of maintaining elective oncological surgeries through selection by directed anamnesis. Method Retrospective cohort study with prospective collection comparing colorectal surgery for cancer before and during the pandemic from December 2019 to July 2020. Results In total, 81 patients were included. During the pandemic, 41 patients were operated on with 2 perioperative contaminations by COVID-19. Both length of stay and complications were not different between groups. Conclusion Since there was no increase in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in elective oncology surgeries with patients screened for guided anamnesis, it is worth considering this method for maintaining surgical procedures even in the event of apandemic.","Vicente, Aline Celeghini Rosa; Marinho, Mariana Souza; Silva, Poliana Graciele de Souza; Molina, Raissa Oliveira; Manzione, Thiago da Silveira; Godoy, Louisie Galantini Lana de; Formiga, Fernanda Bellotti; Bin, Fang Chia","J. coloproctol.

Safety and efficacy of Tocilizumab (TCZ) in Covid-19 pneumonia is uncertain yet. In this study, we aimed to determine clinical outcomes in patients treated with TCZ. Objectives: In this study we aimed to share our retrospective results which we had obtained from patients with COVID-19 diagnosis received TCZ. Methods: We performed a retrospective case control study between May and August 2020 in Turkey. We compared outcomes in patients who received TCZ with those who did not. Death in hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) requirements were evaluated as endpoints. Demographic data, comorbidities, additional treatment, treatment side effects, laboratory and clinical results were retrospectively assessed. There are no significant differences between groups according to age, gender and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Results: 12 (27.3%) patients died in standard group and eight (18.6%) patients died in TCZ group (p=0.150).Days of staying in the hospital were eight days in standard treatment group and 12 days in TCZ group (p=0.03). 10 of 43 patients in TCZ group were admitted to ICU. MV support was needed in 8 of these patients. 18 of 44 patients (40.9%) within the standard group were admitted to ICU and 12 patients (27.3%) were intubated (p=0.125,p=0.480). Significant IL-6 decrease was not observed post treatment in TCZ group according to pretreatment period (p=0.60). Significant decreases were examined in CRP and ferritin values through TCZ treatment. However, D-dimer and thrombocyte values increased. Conclusion: TCZ may not be an effective treatment for reducing ICU requirement, to prevent intubation or death, for shortening period for staying in hospital. The patients should be followed up closely for possible thrombosis because of increased D-dimer and thrombocytes with TCZ treatment.","Öztürk, Z.; Türk, S.

Design Cross-sectional validation study. Setting Two study centres in urban and rural German outpatient hospital settings. Participants In total N=83 community-dwelling older adults were recruited (n=40 from urban and n=43 from rural areas; mean age was 78.5 (SD=5.4); 49% male). Primary and secondary outcome measures The final version of the translated LSA-D was related with questions about activities and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL/iADL; primary hypothesis), Timed-Up&Go-Test (TUG), self-rated health, balance confidence and history of falls, use of transportation, and sociodemographic factors to obtain construct validity. Secondary outcome measures of health included handgrip strength, screening of cognitive function and comorbidities. To assess conduct construct validity, correlations between LSA-D and all health measures were examined for total sample, urban and rural subsamples using bivariate regression and multiple adjusted regression models. Posthoc analyses included different LSA-D scoring methods for each region. All parameters were estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping procedure.

170930,Corporate Tax Integrity and the Market Reactions to Covid-19: Evidence from China,2021,"Background: Adults with rheumatic diseases are a COVID-19 vulnerable population with potential increased risk for severe infection. COVID-19 vaccines are a key strategy to ending the pandemic. Unfortunately, fears about vaccines, some of which are propagated by misinformation, are common and may prevent or inappropriately delay vaccination. Refusal or uncertainty to get a vaccine despite its availability is known as vaccine hesitancy. Objectives: This study aims at defining causes of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among rheumatology patients. Methods: Between November and December 2020, a cross-sectional survey was completed by rheumatology patients presenting to a large Canadian tertiary-care center for influenza immunization. COVID-19 risk factors, previous COVID-19 infection, the likelihood of getting a future COVID-19 vaccine (scale 0-10), and contextual, individual, and vaccine-specific potential determinants of vaccine hesitancy were assessed. Patients were classified into 5 groups based on how likely they were to get a future COVID-19 vaccine (0= not likely at all;2.5= unlikely;5= intermediate;7.5= likely;10= highly likely). A machine learning approach (XgBoost) was used to fit univariate models for a multi-class correlation. Results: 157 rheumatology patients completed the survey. Most were females (n=112, 71%) with a mean age of 54.6 (standard deviation 17.9). The majority (73%) had tertiary-education, and 46% were employed at the time of the survey. The most common rheumatology diagnoses were rheumatoid arthritis (n=90, 58%), systemic lupus erythematosus/vasculitis (n=41, 26%) and spondyloarthropathies (n=39, 25%). Most patients were on immunosuppressors (n=93, 59%). Only half (n=85, 54%) were highly likely to accept a future COVID vaccine, 17% (n=26) likely, 19% (n=30) intermediate, 6% (n=10) unlikely, and 4% (n=6) not likely at all. One hundred thirty-five patients (86%) previously received the flu vaccine, whereas 6% (n=10) previously rejected it. Only three patients were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 (2%) one of whom was hospitalized. Eighty-seven patients (56%) considered that the COVID-19 vaccine should be mandatory, and 101 (65%) that they should receive it. Most respondents were somewhat concerned about receiving a future COVID-19 vaccine (n=116, 76%) despite that 65% believed that vaccines benefits outweighed their risks. Almost all, (n=145, 96%) believed that governmental decisions about vaccines are in the best interest of the population, while less than half (n=70, 45%) were confident that pharmaceutical companies would provide safe and effective vaccines. One hundred participants (65%) denied feeling social pressure to get the vaccine, and 55% (n=81) were willing to pay for the vaccine. Feeling social pressure about getting a COVID-19 vaccine, having severe concerns about receiving a future COVID-19 vaccine, distrust in pharmaceutical companies, lower education, and doubts of whether vaccines benefits outweigh their risks, were negatively associated with COVID vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: Forty six percent of rheumatology patients being immunized against influenza showed at least some hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccination. Multiple contextual, individual, and vaccine-related factors may contribute. Targeted educational strategies, including producing and communicating data on vaccine safety, may help promote vaccine uptake in this potentially vulnerable population.","Valerio, V.; Shen, H.

170932,"Impact of COVID-19 on tourism sector: a case study of Rajasthan, India",2021,"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of life. Integra Connect sought to assess its impact on new visits for cancer care by querying its Electronic Medical Record and Claims database as a surrogate for understanding Covid's impact on cancer care in the larger United States population. Methods: Using Real World Data (RWD) from over 1200 oncology providers in 14 large practice settings, comprising 250 plus care sites in the ICD, we measured new patient (Pt) and established Pt visits from 2018 through 2020. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) codes for new and established Pt's were applied to define cohorts. Disease states were defined using CMS Oncology Care Model (OCM) mapping to diagnosis codes. Because the ICD is heavily based in the Eastern US, we conducted a geographic analysis by segmenting providers by Northeast (NE) with 506 providers from NY, NJ, PA, and VA and Southeast (SE) with 578 providers from FL, GA, SC, and AL. We looked at visits across all tumor types and identified breast cancer (BC) and colorectal cancer (CC) as likely to be most affected by decreased screening, and multiple myeloma (MM) and advanced prostate cancer (APC) as likely to be vulnerable to delay in initiation of first treatment since treatment often trails diagnosis. Results: We found a decline in new patient volume (NPV) in '20 of -1% compared to '19;this compared to an anticipated increase of +7% based on growth in NPV in the ICD from '18 to '19. In the NE we saw NPV decrease in '20 by -7% vs. '19 but increase by +6% in the SE compared to '19. In comparing NPV '20 to '19 and '19 to '18, we saw a smaller increase for BC of +4% vs. +6% and for CC of +5% vs. +7%, respectively. Whereas in MM it was -7% vs. +3% and APC -6% vs. +8%. (See Table). Conclusions: Covid-19 has negatively impacted cancer care access. This RWD shows the number of both newly diagnosed Pts and those with initial oncologic intervention in established Pts, where symptoms traditionally have determined initiation of treatment, has declined year-overyear. The American Cancer Society projected new Pt cases to increase +2% in '20 to 1.806 million (ACS, Cancer Facts and Figures 2020), whereas in the ICD, that figure was projected +7% but resulted in -1%. This suggests a major expected reduction of new Pt cases in the US at large. The drop in cases during Covid-19 in our data was greater in the NE compared to the SE. In addition, the drop in the NE in our data was earlier and more prolonged than SE. While recovery occurred in both regions, after an initial overshoot following lockdowns, volumes plateaued at levels lower than pre-pandemic.","Gart, M.; Varughese, P.; Gordan, L.

Using ribosome profiling, we identify multiple mechanisms including frameshifting, tRNA dysregulation and alternate translation initiation sites that regulate viral protein synthesis. A significant fraction (~ 40%) of ribosomes undergo frameshifting on NS1 coding sequence leading to early termination, translation of NS1′ protein and modulation of viral protein stoichiometry. Separately, a tRNA subset (glutamate, serine, leucine and histidine) was found to be associated in high levels with the ribosomes upon JEV infection. We also report a previously uncharacterised translational initiation event from an upstream UUG initiation codon in JEV 5′ UTR. A silent mutation at this start site in the vaccine strain has been shown to abrogate neuroinvasiveness suggesting the potential role of translation from this region. Together, our study sheds light on distinct mechanisms that modulate JEV translation with likely consequences for viral pathogenesis.","Rizvi, Vaseef A.; Sarkar, Maharnob; Roy, Rahul",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.16.206920,646
171070,Qualitative content analysis of teachers’ perceptions and experiences in using blended learning during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Background Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are a leading cause of under-5 mortality in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and interventions to reduce mortality are needed. Non-invasive ventilation has been shown to reduce mortality for neonates; however, data for children >1 month of age in LMICs are lacking. The objective of this study was to systematically review the available literature to determine if non-invasive ventilation as the primary modality of respiratory support is efficacious and safe for the management of respiratory distress in non-neonatal pediatric patients in LMICs. Methods We systematically reviewed all studies assessing the endpoints of efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of non-invasive ventilation for pediatric LRTIs in LMICs. A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, LILACS, Web of Science, and Scopus was performed on April 7, 2020. Included studies assessed the safety, efficacy or effectiveness of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in the hospital setting for pediatric patients with respiratory distress from 1 month - 15 years of age in LMICs. All study types, including case reports and case series were included. Studies focusing exclusively on neonates (<28 days old) were excluded. Mortality and rates of adverse events were extracted using Covidence by two independent reviewers. Risk of bias was assessed using GRADE criteria for randomized control trials and a standardized risk of bias assessment tool for observational studies. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018084278). Findings A total of 2174 papers were screened and 20 met criteria for inclusion. There were 5 randomized control trials (RCTs), including 3 large, well-designed RCTs. The first RCT, the ""Bangladesh trial,"" found that children who received bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) compared to low-flow oxygen had a significantly lower risk of failure (6% in CPAP and 24% in low-flow oxygen, p=0.0026) and mortality (4% in CPAP and 15% in low-flow oxygen, p=0.022). A second RCT, the ""Ghana trial,"" found no decrease in all-cause mortality between the CPAP and control arms (3% and 4% respectively, p=0.11); however, an adjusted secondary analysis demonstrated decreased mortality for children under 1 year of age (3% in CPAP and 7% in control group, p=0.01). The third RCT, the ""Malawi trial,"" compared bCPAP to low flow oxygen and found higher mortality in the bCPAP arm (17% and 11% respectively, p=0.036). Among the non-RCT studies, mortality rates ranged from 0-55%. Interpretation The evidence of efficacy, effectiveness, and safety is mixed regarding the use of NIV in children with respiratory failure in LMICs. Our review of the literature suggests that CPAP for non-neonatal pediatric patients should be considered only in well-controlled, high acuity units with high provider-to-patient ratios and direct physician supervision. Until further data are available, CPAP use in LMICs should be limited to children less than 1 year of age. Further research is needed to determine best practices for CPAP prior to wide-spread implementation. Funding There was no funding source for this study.","Sessions, K. L.; Smith, A. G.; Holmberg, P.

This move towards digital citizen participation aligns well with the United Nations’ agenda to encourage the use of digital tools to enable data-driven, direct democracy. From data capture to information generation, and knowledge co-creation, every stage of the data lifecycle bears important considerations to inform policy and practice. Drawing on evidence of participatory policy and practice during COVID-19, we outline a framework for citizen ‘e-participation’ in knowledge co-creation across every stage of the policy cycle. We explore how coupling the generation of information with that of social capital can provide opportunities to collectively build trust in institutions, accelerate recovery and facilitate the ‘e-society’. We outline the key aspects of realising this vision of data-driven direct democracy by discussing several examples. Sustaining participatory knowledge co-creation beyond COVID-19 requires that local organisations and institutions (e.g. academia, health and welfare, government, business) incorporate adaptive learning mechanisms into their operational and governance structures, their integrated service models, as well as employing emerging social innovations.","Godinho, Myron A.; Borda, Ann Kariotis Timothy Molnar Andreea Kostkova Patty Siaw-Teng Liaw",Big Data &amp; Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517211019430,646

Therefore, developing accurate forecasting models to improve epidemic prediction towards better prevention and capabilities management is a complex task. Here, we describe an exploratory analysis to identify non-health risk factors that could improve the forecast and events risk signals using a feasible and practical approach by combining surveillance report data with non-health data from open data sources. Methods: A line listing was developed using information from the World Health Organization Disease Outbreaks News from 2016-2018. A database was created merging the line listing data with non-health indicators from the World Bank. Poisson regression models employing forward imputations were used to establish relationships and predict values over the dependent variable (health event frequency); which are the health events reported by each country to WHO during 2016-2018. Findings: The resulting regression model provided evidence that changes in non-health factors important to community experiences impact the risk of the number of major health events that a country could experience. Three non-health indicators (extrinsic factors) were associated significantly to event frequency (population urban change, gross domestic product change per capita -a novel factor, and average forest area). An exploratory analysis of the current COVID-19 pandemic suggested similar associations, but confounding by global disease burden is likely. Conclusion: Continued development of forecasting approaches capturing available whole-of-society extrinsic factors (non-health factors); could improve the risk management process through earlier hazard identification, and as importantly inform strategic decision processes in multisectoral strategies to preventing, detecting, and responding to pandemic-threat events.","Lugo-Robles, R.

The authors present the case that the interconnected developments of the testing industry and the Assessment Industrial Complex (AIC) have effectively anchored American schooling to testing. Using an antiracist lens, the authors deconstruct the AIC, exposing the neoliberal agenda of education reformers and how proponents utilize the rhetoric of testing, and the data extracted from them, to normalize the reliance on AIC systems. This critique further exposes education reformers’ ideological agenda, their hypocrisy, and how they grossly profit from the AIC at the expense of society’s marginalized and most vulnerable students. The COVID-19 pandemic, society’s racial unrest, and anti-testing movements have aligned to underscore the need to examine systemic oppression and the impact it has on society through our education system.

171590,Remote Assessment in Higher Education during COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Herpes Simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) encode up to 16 envelope proteins, four of which are essential for entry. However, whether these four proteins alone are sufficient to dictate the broad cellular tropism of HSV-1 and the selection of different cell-type dependent entry routes is unknown. To begin addressing this, we previously pseudotyped VSV, lacking its native glycoprotein G, with only the four essential entry glycoproteins of HSV-1: gB, gH, gL, and gD. This novel VSVΔG-BHLD pseudotype recapitulated several important features of HSV-1 entry: the requirement for gB, gH, gL, gD, a cellular receptor, and sensitivity to anti-gB and anti-gH/gL neutralizing antibodies. However, due to the use of a single cell type in that study, the tropism of the VSVΔG-BHLD pseudotype was not investigated. Here, we show that the cellular tropism of the pseudotype is severely limited compared to wild-type HSV-1 and that its entry pathways differ from the native HSV-1 entry pathways. To test the hypothesis that other HSV-1 envelope proteins may contribute to HSV-1 tropism, we generated a derivative pseudotype containing the HSV-1 glycoprotein gC (VSVΔG-BHLD-gC) and observed a gC-dependent increase in entry efficiency in two cell types. We propose that the pseudotyping platform developed here has the potential to uncover functional contributions of HSV-1 envelope proteins to entry in a gain-of-function manner. Importance Herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) contain up to 16 different proteins in their envelopes. Four of these, glycoproteins gB, gD, gH, and gL, are termed essential with regard to entry whereas the rest are typically referred to as non-essential based on the entry phenotypes of the respective single genetic deletions. However, the single-gene deletion approach, which relies on robust loss-of-function phenotypes, may be confounded by functional redundancies among the many HSV-1 envelope proteins. We have developed a pseudotyping platform, in which the essential four entry glycoproteins are isolated from the rest, which can be added back individually for systematic gain-of-function entry experiments. Here, we show the utility of this platform for dissecting the contributions of HSV envelope proteins, both the essential four and the remaining dozen (using gC as an example), to HSV entry.","Hilterbrand, Adam T.; Daly, Raecliffe E.; Heldwein, Ekaterina E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.985325,646

To be sustainable, inclusive and less unequal, urban policy and policies must therefore take these differences into account. In this moving film, the female component represents a fundamental aspect. For a heavy cultural question, in Italy there has been a delay in society with respect to the idea of equal opportunities between men and women. Italy remains far from the watchword - mainstreaming - which Europe, on the other hand, has begun to develop and disseminate. And it is a European document that for the first time introduces the theme of the “right to the city for women”. There is certainly no shortage of innovative cases also promoted by female figures in Italian local administrations. In practice, however, a systematic overview is lacking. Apart from the issue of sustainable mobility, temporal policies are particularly important for a gender sensitive territorial planning. The interesting and innovative aspect is the transversality of the temporal dimension, both in the lives of individuals and in the social organization of urban space. The lockdown canceled the diversification of the times of daily life and the use of urban space: “time” considered a certain fact, never questioned, has become a precious, quality asset;through new rhythms for a new urban livability and mostly for a better life of women. For this to happen, however, the city must change its skin, it must change its thinking and above all its rhythms.

172190,Face-to-face interventions to encourage enrolment in cardiac rehabilitation; a scoping review protocol,2021-02-22,"This study examines how social determinants associated with COVID-19 mortality change over time. Using US county-level data from July 5 and December 28, 2020, the effect of 19 high-risk factors on COVID-19 mortality rate was quantified at each time point with negative binomial mixed models. Then, these high-risk factors were used as controls in two association studies between 40 social determinants and COVID-19 mortality rates using data from the same time points. The results indicate that counties with certain ethnic minorities and age groups, immigrants, prevalence of diseases like pediatric asthma and diabetes and cardiovascular disease, socioeconomic inequalities, and higher social association are associated with increased COVID-19 mortality rates. Meanwhile, more mental health providers, access to exercise, higher income, chronic lung disease in adults, suicide, and excessive drinking are associated with decreased mortality. Our temporal analysis also reveals a possible decreasing impact of socioeconomic disadvantage and air quality, and an increasing effect of factors like age, which suggests that public health policies may have been effective in protecting disadvantaged populations over time or that analysis utilizing earlier data may have exaggerated certain effects. Overall, we continue to recognize that social inequality still places disadvantaged groups at risk, and we identify possible relationships between lung disease, mental health, and COVID-19 that need to be explored on a clinical level. © 2021 ACM.","Debopadhaya, S.; Erickson, J.

Sociological experiments studying animal charisma have relied on stated preferences to find correlations between hypothetical “willingness to pay” or “empathy” for a species’ conservation and species’ size, color, and aesthetic appeal (51; 13; 16). Recognizing the increasing availability of digital records of public engagement with animals that reveal preferences, an emerging field of “culturomics” uses Google search results, Wikipedia article activities, and other digital modes of engagement to identify charismatic species and traits (46; 31; 10; 41). In this study, we take advantage of community science efforts as another form of digital data that can reveal observer preferences. We apply a multi-stage analysis to ask whether opportunistic birders contributing to iNaturalist engage more with larger, more colorful, and rarer birds relative to a baseline, from eBird contributors, approximating unbiased detection. We find that body mass, color contrast, and range size all predict over-representation in the opportunistic dataset. We also find evidence that, across 473 modeled species, 52 species are significantly overreported and 158 are significantly underreported, indicating a wide variety of species-specific effects. Understanding which birds are charismatic can aid conservationists in creating impactful outreach materials and engaging new naturalists.

To better understand how protein abundances are maintained across varying genetic backgrounds, we analyzed liver proteomes of three genetically diverse mouse populations. We observe strong concordance of genetic and sex effects across populations. Differences between the populations arise from the contributions of additive, dominance, and epistatic components of heritable variation. We find that the influence of genetic variation on proteins that form complexes relates to their co-abundance. We identify effects on protein abundance from mutations that arose and became fixed during breeding and can lead to unique regulatory responses and disease states.

In turn, the immune systems of infected populations get updated, chasing viruses even further away. Quantitatively understanding how these dynamics result in observed patterns of rapid pathogen and immune adaptation is instrumental to epidemiological and evolutionary forecasting. Here we present a mathematical theory of co-evolution between immune systems and viruses in a finite-dimensional antigenic space, which describes the cross-reactivity of viral strains and immune systems primed by previous infections. We show the emergence of an antigenic wave that is pushed forward and canalized by cross-reactivity. We obtain analytical results for shape, speed, and angular diffusion of the wave. In particular, we show that viral-immune co-evolution generates a new emergent timescale, the persistence time of the wave’s direction in antigenic space, which can be much longer than the coalescence time of the viral population. We compare these dynamics to the observed antigenic turnover of influenza strains, and we discuss how the dimensionality of antigenic space impacts on the predictability of the evolutionary dynamics.

This analysis examines the relationship between risk communication, especially where information comes from, and receptivity to individual-level and community-level health interventions in an emerging threat using evidence from the 2016 rise of Zika. Data comes from a repeat cross-sectional survey conducted three times in 2016, representative of the United States population. Drawing on leading theories of risk communication, a structural model (SEM) is used to measure the relationships of interest. Two distinct SEMs are used to compare and contrast the relationship between source of information and individual health behavior change and community-level health interventions while also exploring the role of knowledge, perceived risk, and demographics. Results of both direct and indirect SEM pathways show different sources of information may be more effective in promoting particular interventions. Promoting community-level interventions can be accomplished through dissemination of information in print news to increase knowledge and ultimately receptivity. However, there is a far more complex relationship between risk communication and personal intervention receptivity.

How each module contributes to gene activation in specific biological contexts is not well understood. Here we analyzed the role of the non-enzymatic core module during Drosophila oogenesis. We show that depletion of several SAGA-specific subunits belonging to the core module blocked egg chamber development during mid-oogenesis stages, resulting in stronger phenotypes than those obtained after depletion of SAGA’s histone acetyltransferase module or deubiquitination module. These results, as well as additional genetic analyses pointing to an interaction with TBP, suggested a differential role of SAGA modules at different promoter types. However, SAGA subunits co-occupied all promoter types of active genes in ChIP-seq and ChIP-nexus experiments. Thus, the SAGA complex appears to occupy promoters in its entirety, consistent with the strong biochemical integrity of the complex. The high-resolution genomic binding profiles are congruent with SAGA recruitment by activators upstream of the start site, and retention on chromatin by interactions with modified histones downstream of the start site. The stronger genetic requirement of the core module during oogenesis may therefore be explained through its interaction with TBP or its role in recruiting the enzymatic modules to the promoter. We propose the handyman principle, which posits that a distinct genetic requirement for specific components may conceal the fact that the entire complex is physically present. Author Summary Embryonic development critically relies on the differential expression of genes in different tissues. This involves the dynamic interplay between DNA, sequence-specific transcription factors, coactivators and chromatin remodelers which guide the transcription machinery to the appropriate promoters for productive transcription. To understand how this happens at the molecular level, we need to understand when and how coactivator complexes such as SAGA function. SAGA consists of multiple modules with well characterized enzymatic functions. This study shows that the non-enzymatic core module of SAGA is required for Drosophila oogenesis, while the enzymatic functions are largely dispensable. Despite this differential requirement, SAGA subunits appear to be broadly recruited to all promoter types, consistent with the biochemical integrity of the complex. These results suggest that genetic requirements and physical organization do not always go hand in hand.","Soffers, Jelly H.M.; Alcantara, Sergio Garcia-Moreno; Li, Xuanying; Shao, Wanqing; Seidel, Christopher W.; Li, Hua; Zeitlinger, Julia; Abmayr, Susan M.; Workman, Jerry L.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.18.448946,646
174981,Journal Club,2021,"Purpose This study aims to explore worldwide innovative solutions that have been proposed to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on people's mental health. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative methodology is adopted, which performs an exploratory study considering the innovative projects identified by the Observatory for Public Sector Innovation framework. Additionally, the analysis of the relevance and characteristics of these projects are explored considering a multidimensional framework composed of five dimensions: novelty level;social need;improvement of society;sector neutrality;and level of emergence. Findings The findings reveal that the number of projects in the field of mental health is low, despite their strong relevance to their communities. These projects arise from a strong social need to protect especially the most vulnerable groups in this pandemic and involve a large number of partners in the public sector, business and civil society. The role of volunteering in the revitalization and growth of these initiatives is also recognized. Originality/value This study is relevant in both the theoretical and practical dimensions. It allows the exploration of these projects considering the dimensions of social innovation and offers practical implications that allow these projects to be replicated in other countries and regions.","Rocha, A.; Almeida, F.",Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/jstpm-11-2020-0165,646
175154,Flipped classrooms and COVID-19 disruption: Empirical results,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic introduced new challenges for medical education. In particular, student assessment posed some of the most urging questions. How do we evaluate practical skills when our universities are on lockdown and our hospitals are working on a shortage of personnel? Is it possible to evaluate these skills via online means, mitigating the effects in students' career development? This paper presents an online evaluation experience implemented at Instituto Oncológico Henry Moore-Universidad Del Salvador, Buenos Aires in the postgraduate program of Clinical Oncology. The Virtual Observational Standard Clinical Examination (VOSCE) is a technology-based adaptation of the Observational Standard Clinical Examination (OSCE) (JCO 34 (15), Abstract e18150, 2017) implemented in previous years. Methods: The VOSCE took place in November 14, 2020 and consisted on a half-day evaluation during which students rotated through 8 stations (Table). The exam ran on three platforms: Blackboard Collaborate for the interactive elements of all stations;University online campus (Moodle platform) for student questionnaires, and Google Forms for the evaluators' assessment of each student. Students and evaluators participated in various training sessions, and were given a month to practice before the exam. All interactions were recorded and an anonymous survey on students' experience and opinions was conducted after the exam. Results: A total of 25 postgraduate Oncology students participated in the V-OSCE. 24 students (96%) completed all stations on time with minimum or no network connection issues. Student opinions: 24 students completed the exam experience anonymous survey;23 found the exam tech-friendly and valued the practice time provided. When asked to score the exam in a scale of 1 to 10: 80% of the students ranked the exam with 9 or 10;and 20%, with 7 or 8. Conclusions: A) It is feasible to design new ways to assess medical students via online means. B) The experience of an OSCE can be translated to an online environment with minimum technological requirements. C) The COVID-19 pandemic effects are extensive, with serious implications in medical education. However, it has proved to be an opportunity to rethink our educational practices, design innovative formative experiences, and assess new skills that will remain significant even long after the pandemic has ended.","Abal, M.; Deza, L.

Limited data exist beyond registration trials. We sought to explore the use of adjuvant immunotherapy in routine clinical practice. Methods: Patients (pts) from 11 Australian centres who received adjuvant nivolumab (nivo) for resected stage III/IV melanoma were included in this study. Efficacy, toxicity, surveillance, recurrence characteristics, management and further treatment outcomes were examined. Results:471 pts received adjuvant nivo between 8/2018 to 3/2020. 318 (68%) were male, median age 64y (range 17-94), 28 (6%) were AJCC v8 IIIA, 194 (41%) IIIB, 175 (37%) IIIC, 11 (2%) IIID, and 63 (13%) IV. 65 (14%) pts had intransit only disease, 152 (37%) pts were sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB+) and only 9 (6%) of these had CLND. 128 (27%) had BRAF mutant (BRAFmt) melanoma. Median time from resection to start of adjuvant nivo was 1.8 months (mo) (range 0.2-4.0). Median FU was 17.5 mo. 256 (54%) pts completed 12 months of nivo, 86 (18%) ceased early for toxicity, 76 (16%) for disease recurrence, 25 (5%) other reasons (COVID-19 8, co-morbidities 7, pt choice 10);28 (6%) pts were still receiving nivo at data cut. Median duration of treatment was 10.4 mo (range 0-16.8). 117 (25%) pts recurred;76 (65%) while ON nivo and 41 (35%) OFF nivo ( &gt; 1 month after last dose, including 20 pts who stopped early for toxicity). 24 mo RFS was 69%. Median time to recurrence was 6.0 mo (95% CI 5.1, 7.5). 56 (48%) had first recurrence with locoregional (LR) disease only and 61 (52%) had distant +/- LR recurrence. Of those who recurred with LR disease only, 46/56 (82%) underwent surgery, 15/46 (33%) then had adjuvant radiotherapy, and 15/46 (33%) had 'second adjuvant' therapy with BRAF/MEK inhibitors (15/21, 71% BRAFmt pts). 10/56 (37%) pts who recurred with LR disease subsequently recurred distantly. 58/80 (73%) pts received systemic therapy at either 1st or subsequent unresectable recurrence. For recurrences ON nivo, 18 pts received combination ipilimumab (ipi) and nivo (ORR 44%), 4 pts had ipi monotherapy (ORR 0%), 7 pts had anti-PD1 + investigational agent (ORR 57%), 11 pts had BRAF/MEK inhibitors (ORR 82%). 1 pt had PD with ongoing PD1 monotherapy. For recurrences OFF nivo, no patients responded to PD1 alone (n = 1) or with an investigational agent (n = 1), ipi+nivo (n = 3), ipi monotherapy (n = 4) or chemotherapy (n = 2);6 pts received BRAF/MEK inhibitors (ORR 50%). 2-year OS was 92%. Conclusions: Despite higher rates of discontinuation due to toxicity compared with clinical trial cohorts, the efficacy data appear similar. Most early recurrences are distant, and many with LR recurrence soon recur distantly thereafter. Second line adjuvant BRAF/MEK inhibitors are frequently used for resected LR recurrence. Both ipi+nivo and BRAF/MEK inhibitors appear to have activity after distant recurrence.","Johnson, R.; Atkinson, V.; Bhave, P.; Weppler, A. M.; Peters, G. D.; Abed, A.; Lyle, M.; Khattak, M.

Treatment practices may have changed based on data from this recent trial which suggested that the risk of AVM treatment is greater than medical management in unruptured AVMs. To assess the ‘real world’ experience with interventional AVM outcomes, we compared outcomes of ARUBA eligible patients from the NVQI-QOD registry database to the ARUBA trial results.MethodsIn an IRB approved study, the NVQI-QOD AVM registry database was queried for treated patients between 2017 to present with the following inclusion criteria: age > 18 years, baseline mRS> 1, unruptured AVMs. 174/364 patients were ARUBA eligible and were included in the analysis. Patients were divided into embolization alone, microsurgery with or without embolization, and gamma knife radiation therapy with or without embolization. Primary outcomes of ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke or death were analyzed with a mean follow up time of 5.8 months (range 1 to 128 months).ResultsA total of 14 (8.0%) of patients that underwent any type of intervention suffered stroke or mortality. The risk of stroke or death was 6.8% (5 of 74) for microsurgery, 5.4% (2 of 37) for gamma knife, and 10.9% (7 of 64) for embolization alone. Annual stroke or death rates for all treatments were 7.5% (13 of 174) at one year and 0.57% (1 of 174) at 2 years.ConclusionARUBA eligible patients from the NVQI-QOD registry demonstrate a significantly lower risk of stroke or death with intervention of 8.0% (N=174) compared to the 30.7% (N=114) ARUBA trial interventional risk, and is nearly equivalent to the ARUBA trial medical management risk of 10.1% (N=109) over 33 months.DisclosuresN.

Objective: To examine the health practices of the Indonesian citizens and their correlations with knowledge and health belief model (perceived susceptibility, barriers, benefits, severity, and self-efficacy) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A community-based online cross-sectional design was employed. The study was conducted from 10 July to 30 August 2020 among 552 citizens selected using convenience sampling. Sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge, health belief model, and health practices, including wearing a mask, social distancing, and washing hands, were measured using validated questionnaires. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and logistic regression were employed for data analysis. Results: The adjusted AORs (95% CIs) of a good level of health practices-wearing the mask, social distancing, and washing hands-were 3.24 (1.52 similar to 6.89), 2.54 (1.47 similar to 4.39), and 2.11 (1.19 similar to 3.75), respectively, in citizens with the high level of knowledge. Interestingly, respondents with positively perceived susceptibility exhibited significantly good practice in wearing the mask (4.91;2.34 similar to 10.31), social distancing (1.95;1.08 similar to 3.52), and washing hands (3.99;2.26 similar to 7.05) compared to those with negatively perceived susceptibility. In addition, perceived barriers, benefits, severity, and self-efficacy also exhibited a significantly good all variables of health practice regarding COVID-19 pandemic after adjusting for confounding variables. Conclusion: Citizens with high levels of knowledge and positive levels of the health belief model had good practice of wearing masks, social distancing, and washing hands.

176566,Corporate Social Responsibility and Business Performance in Takaful Agencies: The Moderating Role of Objective Environment,2020,"Background Nursing Home (NH) residents are at high risk of serious illness and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), especially with the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns (VOC). It is unknown as to whether a history of Covid-19 prior to the vaccine and post-vaccine RBD-IgG levels are predictors of BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against VOC-delta in nursing home residents. Methods We analyzed the data from two NHs that faced a VOC-delta outbreak in July-August 2021. These NHs had suffered prior Covid-19 outbreaks in 2020 and 2021. In many of the residents, RBD-IgG levels were measured 6 weeks after the second vaccine dose, i.e. 3 to 5 months before the VOC-delta outbreak onset, and again during the outbreak (SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay, Abbott Diagnostics). We compared residents with vs without prior Covid-19 for (i) VOC-delta incidence, (ii) the correlation between post-vaccine RBD-IgG levels and VOC-delta incidence, and (iii) the time-related change in RBD-IgG levels. Results Among the 140 analyzed residents (58 to 101 years; 94 females, 46 men, mean age (SD): 84.6 yr (9.5 yr), one resident among the 44 with prior Covid-19 before vaccination developed a VOC-delta infection during the outbreak (1.3%) vs 55 of the 96 without Covid-19 prior to vaccination (57.3 %)(p<0.0001). The median value for RBD-IgG after the vaccine and during the outbreak was higher in residents with prior Covid-19 (31553 AU/mL and 22880 AU/mL) than in those without (1050 AU/mL and 260 AU/mL)(p<0.0001). In residents without Covid-19 prior to vaccination, post-vaccination RDB-IgG levels did not predict protection against VOC-delta infection. Conclusions In contrary to residents with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, those without a history of Covid-19 before two BNT162b2 doses are not protected against VOC-delta infection and their RBD-Ig-G levels are low 3 to 5 months after vaccination. This suggests that a booster vaccine dose should be considered in this group of residents for a better protection against VOC-delta infection.","Blain, H.; TUAILLON, E.; Pisoni, A.; Soriteau, L.; Million, E.; Leglise, M.-S.; Bussereau, I.; Miot, S.; Rolland, Y.; Picot, M.-C.; Bousquet, J.

176640,Investing in a better future: Higher education and post-COVID Canada,2021,"Introduction: A study examining the impact of social determinants of health on COVID-19 outcomes is necessary to identify which aspects of a vulnerable population make it more susceptible. We describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of a patient population disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 and situate the findings within the broader context of health determinants. Materials and Methods: A descriptive study of 527 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized from March 12 to April 13, 2020, evaluated patient demographics, comorbidities, presentation, and outcomes. The study took place at an academic medical center serving a low-income, Black community (predominantly Caribbean-born) in Brooklyn, New York. Results: Compared to previous studies, we report a higher median age of 70 (interquartile range 59-80), a higher percentage of Blacks (91%), a higher prevalence of comorbidities (hypertension [83%], diabetes [53%], and obesity [42%]), a higher prevalence of abnormal findings on presentation (altered mental status [30%], Quick sequential organ failure assessment score ≥2 [27%], elevated random-glucose [77%], elevated creatinine [57%]), and a higher incidence of negative in-hospital outcomes (intensive care unit admission [21%], mechanical ventilation [21%], acute kidney injury [31%], acute respiratory distress syndrome [17%] and acute cardiac injury [18%], and age-adjusted fatality rate [40%.]). Conclusions: This study shows the characteristics of a patient population disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. The intersectionality of the Black race, older age, a high prevalence of comorbidities, and residency in a locale severely affected by COVID-19, deserves further consideration to better address health outcomes in vulnerable patient groups.

176656,"Digital stories, material transformations: reflections of education students in a pre-teacher program",2021,"Introduction Rapid outbreak response vaccination is a strategy for measles control and elimination. Measles vaccines must be stored and transported within a specified temperature range, but this can present significant challenges when targeting remote populations. Measles vaccine licensure for delivery outside cold chain (OCC) could provide more vaccine transport/storage space without ice packs, and a solution to shorten response times. However, due to vaccine safety and wastage considerations, the OCC strategy will require other operational changes, potentially including the use of 1-dose (monodose) instead of 10-dose vials, requiring larger transport/storage equipment currently achieved with 10-dose vials. These trade-offs require quantitative comparisons of vaccine delivery options to evaluate their relative benefits. Methods We developed a modelling framework combining elements of the vaccine supply chain - cold chain, vial, team, and transport equipment types - with a measles transmission dynamics model to compare vaccine delivery options. We compared 10 strategies resulting from combinations of the vaccine supply elements and grouped into three main classes: OCC, partial cold chain (PCC), and full cold chain (FCC). For each strategy, we explored a campaign with 20 teams sequentially targeting 5 locations with 100,000 individuals each. We characterised the time needed to freeze ice packs and complete the campaign (campaign duration), vaccination coverage, and cases averted, assuming a fixed pre-deployment delay before campaign commencement. We performed sensitivity analyses of the pre-deployment delay, population sizes, and two team allocation schemes. Results The OCC, PCC, and FCC strategies achieve campaign durations of 50, 51, and 52 days, respectively. Nine of the ten strategies can achieve a vaccination coverage of 80%, and OCC averts the most cases. Discussion The OCC strategy, therefore, presents improved operational and epidemiological outcomes relative to current practice and the other options considered.","Azam, J.

176667,Faculty experiences on emergency remote teaching during COVID-19: a multicentre qualitative analysis,2021,"Missing (MP) and functionally uncharacterized proteins (uPE1) comprise less than 5% of the total number of human Chr18 genes. Within half a year, since the January 2020 version of NextProt, the number of entries in the MP+uPE1 datasets has changed, mainly due to the achievements of antibody-based proteomics. Assuming that the proteome is closely related to the transcriptome scaffold, quantitative PCR, Illumina HiSeq, and Oxford Nanopore Technology were applied to characterize the liver samples of three male donors compared with the HepG2 cell line. The data mining of Expression Atlas (EMBL-EBI) and the profiling of our biospecimens using orthogonal methods of transcriptome analysis have shown that in HepG2 cells and the liver, the genes encoding functionally uncharacterized proteins (uPE1) are expressed as low as for the missing proteins (less than 1 copy per cell), except for selected cases of HSBP1L1, TMEM241, C18orf21, and KLHL14. The initial expectation that uPE1 genes might be expressed at higher levels than MP genes, was compromised by severe discrepancies in our semi-quantitative gene expression data and in public databanks. Such discrepancy forced us to revisit the transcriptome of Chr18, the target of Russian C-HPP Consortia. Tanglegram of highly expressed genes and further correlation analysis have shown the severe dependencies on the mRNA extraction method and analytical platform. Targeted gene expression analysis by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and high-throughput transcriptome profiling (Illumina HiSeq and ONT MinION) for the same set of samples from normal liver tissue and HepG2 cells revealed the detectable expression of 250+ (92%) protein-coding genes of Chr18 (at least one method). The expression of slightly more than 50% protein-coding genes was detected simultaneously by all three methods. Correlation analysis of the gene expression profiles showed that the grouping of the datasets depended almost equally on both the type of biological material and the experimental method, particularly cDNA/mRNA isolation and library preparation. The dependence on the choice of bioinformatics analysis pipeline was also noticeable but significantly less. Furthermore, the combination of Illumina HiSeq and ONT MinION sequencing to validate proteotypic peptides of missing and uPE1 proteins was performed for the heat-shock factor binding protein HSBP1L1 (missing protein, recently transferred to PE1 category) and uncharacterized protein C18orf21 (uPE1). We observed that a nonsynonymous SNP led to the loss of the site of trypsinolysis in HSBP1L1. The modified version of HSBP1L1 was included in the sequence database and searched against the MS/MS dataset from Kulak, Geyer & Mann (2017), but delivered no significant identification. Thus, HSBP1L1 is still missing for the MS-pillar of C-HPP, although its existence at the protein level has been confirmed.","Krasnov, George S.; Radko, Sergey P.; Ptitsyn, Konstantin G.; Shapovalova, Valeriya V.; Timoshenko, Olga S.; Khmeleva, Svetlana A.; Kurbatov, Leonid K.; Kiseleva, Yana Y.; Ilgisonis, Ekaterina V.; Pyatnitskiy, Mikhail A.; Poverennaya, Ekaterina V.; Kiseleva, Olga I.; Vakhrushev, Igor V.; Tsvetkova, Anastasia V.; Buromski, Ivan V.; Markin, Sergey S.; Zgoda, Victor G.; Archakov, Alexander I.; Lisitsa, Andrey V.; Ponomarenko, Elena A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.04.358739,646

However, e-commerce can be a better option to stop the spread of COVID-19 due to its real benefits and usefulness in solving the challenges faced. The methodology used in this paper is the collection of primary data from an online survey questionnaire, and secondary data from several databases,e.g.,the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Johns Hop-kins Centre websites. The results show the negative impact of COVID-19 on society and the economy, as well as the positive and significant effects ofthe growth of e-commerce during COVID-19, where most of the goods being purchased are medical supplies: masks, medicines, and food. This has been made possibleby the rise of e-commerce platforms as a link in sustainable e-commerce after the significant disruption to the worldwide supply chain due to total lockdown. E-commerce has shown growth during the COVID-19 pandemic period as a sustainable platform. In conclusion, this study proposes policies that support e-commerce in developing countries during and after COVID-19. Furthermore, theoretical, and managerial implications are proposed in the study. It is high time to warn businesses to adopt information and communications technology (ICT) to flourish and thrive during times of financial and economic hardship, such as the use of e-commerce with the right policies enacted to support sustainable e-commerce. © 2021, WSB University.

Por ello, las inflamaciones sistémicas son consideradas un factor importante en el agravamiento y la evolución de estas enfermedades neurodegenerativas. Las citocinas proinflamatorias periféricas pueden inducir la síntesis de citocinas dentro del sistema nervioso centra, siendo responsables tanto de los cambios patológicos como de los comportamentales. Recientemente, la enfermedad causada por el coronavirus 19, originada por la infección del virus SARS-CoV-2, caracterizada por la denominada «tormenta de citocinas» en sangre periférica, ha sido asociada a varias alteraciones neurológicas. En el presente trabajo describiremos los principales aspectos de la comunicación entre la periferia y el cerebro y los mecanismos involucrados en la misma. Peripheral inflammation flares up the ongoing damage within the central nervous system with neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Therefore, systemic inflammation is considered a key feature in aggravation and evolution of the neurodegenerative diseases. Pro-inflammatory cytokines induce the synthesis of cytokines within the brain, being responsible of both pathological and behavioural changes. Recently, the coronavirus disease-2019, induced by the infection of the SARS-CoV-2, characterized by the peripheral “cytokine storm”, is associated to neurological disorders. In the present article we will summarize the main aspects related to the relationship between periphery and brain and its associated mechanisms.","Ferrari, Carina Cintia",Neurología Argentina,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuarg.2021.05.008,646

177223,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on tourism: recovery proposal for future tourism,2020,"Neurological diseases are prevalent in the populations from the developed nations including Europe and North America, while South America also shows a high prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although. PD is among the most prevalent neurodegenerative conditions, its cause remains largely unknown. Changing age structure and marked demographic shifts, with progressively larger percentage of their populations entering old age, has been seen in many countries. Females have been found to have a higher life expectancy and longevity than males at any age. We compiled the freely available data on COVID-19, and statistics on life expectancy, and ageing population from the United Nations. The XY-scatter plots with regression analysis were used to assess the correlation between case fatality rate (CFR)/deaths and life expectancy of various countries. We infer that the SARS-00V-2 mediated infections mostly affected the elderly people of age 60+years, who accounted for approximately 50% (20-88.45%) of the total deaths by COVID-19. However, females were found to be 1.66 times less prone to COVID-19-induced deaths compared to the males. The X Y-scatter plot showed no correlation between life expectancy and CFR or deaths due to COVID-19. Similar patterns of CFR/deaths by COVID-19 and PD prevalence were also observed in Europe and America. All the factual data including increased susceptibility of males to COVID-19 and PD, along with relatively less life expectancy than females, indicate that the world may virtually be heading towards a predominantly female older population. However, caution may be exercised in interpreting the results of this preliminary study that may be affected by incorrect or biased reporting on COVID-19 data, regional variations in the infectivity by new mutant strains of SARC-COV-2, and the prevalence and epidemiology of PD and COVID-19 might also affect the associated risk factors for PD in certain population.","Alshahrani, A.

In addition, those who have recovered from COVID-19 are at higher risk of lasting medical complications postdischarge. Importantly, many of these physical complications are likely to cause, and in turn be exacerbated by, psychological complications experienced as a function of illness, extended hospitalization, ventilation, and rigorous quarantine measures. At this time, little is known about the nature and prevalence of these complications, or treatment approaches psychologists may use in providing intervention. Nevertheless, it is possible to identify some of the most likely psychological concerns based on the literature of similar disease states and on psychological sequelae that typically occur following extended intensive care unit (ICU) stays in general. In this article, we characterize psychological presentations likely to be experienced by patients recently discharged from COVID treatment in the ICU based on the review of relevant literature. Specifically, we focus on the domains of: (a) medical trauma, acute stress reaction and posttraumatic stress, (b) cognitive deficits, (c) fatigue and depression, (d) social stress and readjustment, and (e) illness anxiety.

However, this is different from the food industry, which is required to continue producing to meet food needs during the Covid-19 pandemic. This is not in line with the production system that is being implemented because there are several obstacles related to the supply of raw materials for production and ensuring that the health level of workers is maintained during a pandemic. This is a challenge for the food industry, because on the one hand they have to meet the needs of consumers while the production system is hampered because it can be caused by an unusual division of working hours.

Most clinics offered a mix of telehealth and face-to-face consultations for asymptomatic MSM (n=11), asymptomatic transgender persons (n=12), post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) prescription (n=13) or to initiate pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) (n=14). People who were symptomatic for STIs and contacts of STIs were offered face-to-face and telehealth consultations across all clinics. Seven clinics suspended STI test-of-cure consultations and four clinics suspended hepatitis vaccinations for people not living with HIV. Nineteen clinics reported delays in testing and 13 reported limitations in testing during lockdown. Most clinics changed to phone consultations for HIV medication refill (n=15) with faxed (n=14) or mailed (n=13) prescriptions. Fourteen clinics had staff redeployed to assist the COVID-19 response;14 clinics reported a reduction in total number of full-time equivalent (FTE) clinical nurses from 74.4 to 45.6 FTE collectively and three clinics reported reduction in FTE clinical doctors, from 20.1 to 17.1 FTE collectively.ConclusionAustralian public sexual health clinics rapidly pivoted service delivery to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in their clinical settings, managed staffing reductions and delays in molecular testing, released staff to support the COVID-19 response, and maintained a focus on urgent and symptomatic STI presentations and those at higher risk of HIV/STI acquisition.","Phillips, T.; Fairley, C.; Donovan, B.; Ong, J.; McNulty, A.; Marshall, L.; Templeton, D.; Owen, L.; Ward, A.; Gunathilake, M.; Russell, D.; Langton-Lockton, J.; Bourne, C.; Martin, S.; Chow, E.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-sti.342,646

Design: Cross-sectional investigation. Data Sources: Original clinical-trial research articles published in NEJM (n = 206) or JAMA (n = 188) from January 1 to December 31, 2017; self-reported COI disclosure forms submitted to NEJM or JAMA with the authors published articles; Open Payments website (from database inception; latest search: August 2019). Main outcome measures: Financial data reported to Open Payments from 2014 to 2016 (time period that included all subjects requisite disclosure windows) were compared to self-reported disclosure forms submitted to the journals. Payments were defined as those not associated with a research study or formal research funding. Payment types were categorized as disclosed, undisclosed, indeterminate, or unrelated. Results: Thirty-one articles from NEJM and 31 articles from JAMA met inclusion criteria. The physician-authors (n = 118) received a combined total of $7.48 million. Of the 106 authors (89.8%) who received payments, 86 (81.1%) received undisclosed payments. The top 23 most highly compensated received $6.32 million, of which $3.00 million (47.6%) was undisclosed. Disclosure rates were the equivalent between the top 23 and the entire sample. Conclusions: High payment amounts, as well as high proportions of undisclosed financial compensation, regardless of amount received, comprised potential COIs for two influential US medical journals.

As a result, worldwide cities face the need to integrate data from different transportation modes to dynamically respond to changing conditions. This article combines statistical views with machine learning advances to comprehensively explore changing urban mobility dynamics within multimodal public transportation systems from user trip records. In particular, we retrieve discriminative traffic patterns with order-preserving coherence to model disruptions to demand expectations across geographies and show their utility to describe changing mobility dynamics with strict guarantees of statistical significance, interpretability and actionability. This methodology is applied to comprehensively trace the changes to the urban mobility patterns in the Lisbon city brought by the current COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, we consider passenger trip data gathered from the three major public transportation modes: subway, bus, and tramways. The gathered results comprehensively reveal novel travel patterns within the city, such as imbalanced demand distribution towards the city peripheries, going far beyond simplistic localized changes to the magnitude of traffic demand. This work offers a novel methodological contribution with a solid statistical ground for the spatiotemporal assessment of actionable mobility changes and provides essential insights for other cities and public transport operators facing mobility challenges alike.","Aparicio, Joao T.; Arsenio, Elisabete Henriques Rui",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158342,646

Guided by computational alanine scanning and molecular-dynamics simulations, we tune nanobody/target binding affinity to eliminate binding before uncaging. Upon photo-activation, binding is restored. We use this approach to generate improved photocaged variants of two anti-GFP nanobodies. These variants exhibit photo-activatable binding triggered by illumination with 365nm light. We demonstrate that the photocaged nanobodies we have created are highly robust and function in a complex cellular environment. We apply them to control subcellular protein localisation in the nematode worm C. elegans.

The control of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics currently relies on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, teleworking, mouth masks and contact tracing. However, as pre-symptomatic transmission remains an important driver of the epidemic, contact tracing efforts struggle to fully control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Therefore, in this work, we investigate to what extent the use of universal testing, i.e., an approach in which we screen the entire population, can be utilized to mitigate this epidemic. To this end, we rely on PCR test pooling of individuals that belong to the same households, to allow for a universal testing procedure that is feasible with the current testing capacity. We evaluate two isolation strategies: on the one hand pool isolation, where we isolate all individuals that belong to a positive PCR test pool, and on the other hand individual isolation, where we determine which of the individuals that belong to the positive PCR pool are positive, through an additional testing step. We evaluate this universal testing approach in the STRIDE individual-based epidemiological model in the context of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic. As the organisation of universal testing will be challenging, we discuss the different aspects related to sample extraction and PCR testing, to demonstrate the feasibility of universal testing when a decentralized testing approach is used. We show through simulation, that weekly universal testing is able to control the epidemic, even when many of the contact reductions are relieved. Finally, our model shows that the use of universal testing in combination with stringent contact reductions could be considered as a strategy to eradicate the virus.","Libin, Pieter Jules Karel; Willem, Lander; Verstraeten, Timothy; Torneri, Andrea; Vanderlocht, Joris; Hens, Niel",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.03.20205765,646

No studies have examined the influence of various factors on adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures. Among individuals with co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and residing in rural communities, adherence is essential as they are at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection and increased disease severity. Objective: This study aims to explore factors influencing adherence to evidence-based recommendations for preventing COVID-19 among patients/family caregivers with CVD in rural Central Appalachia. Methods: During March-April 2020, 102 CVD Stakeholders-patients/family caregivers, community leaders, and providers from six states across Appalachia participated in a survey administered through RED Cap. This study used a subsample (n=73) that excluded providers. Adherence score was defined as the rate of compliance with health authorities' guidelines, including hand washing, physical distancing, staying home if sick, wearing a face mask, disinfecting and cleaning daily, and cough and sneezing etiquette. Simple and multiple linear regressions were performed to examine associations between adherence scores and variables of interest. Results: Over half (53.42%) of participants complied with all guidelines. Gender, employmentstatus, hypertension, smoking, no insurance, getting information about COVID-19 from Government/CDC website, and getting information about COVID-19 from worship place/club were significantly associated with adherence to CDC recommendations (p&lt;0.05). Compared to lowpersonal perception of threat (PPT), having no and high PPT were associated with lower and higheradherence scores, respectively (β=-2.32, 1.42;p=0.001). Compared to low perception of COVID-19threat towards family/friends, having moderate or high perception of COVID-19 threat to wardfamily/friends was associated with improved adherence (β= 1.3, 1.57;p&lt;0.05 for both), whereashaving no perception was negatively associated with adherence (β=-2.08, p=0.003).

Due to the constantly evolving nature of the coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2-mediated alterations on post-transcriptional gene regulations across human tissues remain elusive. In this study, we analyzed publicly available genomic datasets to systematically dissect the crosstalk and dysregulation of the human post-transcriptional regulatory networks governed by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and micro-RNAs (miRs) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We uncovered that 13 out of 29 SARS-CoV-2-encoded proteins directly interacted with 51 human RBPs, of which the majority of them were abundantly expressed in gonadal tissues and immune cells. We further performed a functional analysis of differentially expressed genes in mock-treated versus SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells that revealed enrichment for the immune response, cytokine-mediated signaling, and metabolism-associated genes. This study also characterized the alternative splicing events in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells compared to the control, demonstrating that skipped exons and mutually exclusive exons were the most abundant events that potentially contributed to differential outcomes in response to the viral infection. A motif enrichment analysis on the RNA genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 clearly revealed the enrichment for RBPs such as SRSFs, PCBPs, ELAVs, and HNRNPs, suggesting the sponging of RBPs by the SARS-CoV-2 genome. A similar analysis to study the interactions of miRs with SARS-CoV-2 revealed functionally important miRs that were highly expressed in immune cells, suggesting that these interactions may contribute to the progression of the viral infection and modulate the host immune response across other human tissues. Given the need to understand the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with key post-transcriptional regulators in the human genome, this study provided a systematic computational analysis to dissect the role of dysregulated post-transcriptional regulatory networks controlled by RBPs and miRs across tissue types during a SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Srivastava, R.; Daulatabad, S.

Pada prosesnya, pembelajaran jarak jauh masih dianggap kurang efisien dalam pelaksanaannya terutama pada proses transfer materi ajar. Akibatnya banyak peserta didik yang mengabaikan pembelajaran. Salah satu upaya mengatasi permasalahan tersebut adalah dengan dilakukan pemilihan model dan metode pembelajaran yang sesuai dengan kondisi saat ini, sehingga perangkat pembelajaran yang digunakan perlu dilakukan pengembangan sebelum digunakan. Penelitian ini menggunakan jenis penelitian Research and Development (R&D) dengan model 4D yang terdiri dari empat tahapan yaitu Define, Design, Develop, dan Disseminate. Perangkat yang dikembangkan pada penelitian ini adalah silabus, RPP, LKPD, dan instrumen tes kemampuan generik sains. Kevalidan perangkat yang dikembangkan diperoleh berdasarkan validitas dari enam validator yaitu tiga validator ahli dan tiga validator praktisi, kemudian kevalidan perangkat dianalisis dengan menggunakan skala Likert. Selanjutnya, keefisienan perangkat ditentukan dari respon peserta didik dan respon guru. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian yang telah dilakukan, diperoleh nilai rata-rata validitas diatas 3.26 dengan kategori sangat baik. Pembelajaran daring yang dilakukan berdasarkan respon peserta didik menunjukkan bahwa peserta didik kurang puas sehingga pembelajaran daring yang dilakukan kurang efisien hal tersebut dikarenakan adanya beberapa kendala salah satunya adalah keterbatasan kuota internet peserta didik. Maka dapat disimpulkan perangkat pembelajaran fisika model berbasis masalah pada materi elastisitas valid tetapi kurang efisien untuk digunakan dalam pembelajaran daring. Kata kunci: perangkat pembelajaran, pembelajaran berbasis masalah, generik sains.","Devi, Via Monica; Susilawati, Susilawati; Gunada, I Wayan; id,","Orbita: Jurnal Kajian, Inovasi Dan Aplikasi Pendidikan Fisika",https://doi.org/10.31764/orbita.v7i1.3822,646

It discusses pertinent questions identifying instances possible to replace and displace managerial functions by AI. The chapter focuses on managerial work and practical intelligence. It explores how distinctive activities are aligned with Soft Skills in human centered leadership. The chapter provides arguments and details justifying why identified Soft Skills may not be replaced or displaced by technology. All leadership actions include two functions: making decisions and executing them. Leadership is always a moral concern that leaders live and express out of virtues. As AI advances applications across disciplines and fields of human activity, it is increasingly subject to an increasing number of myths. To date, AI mainly relies on processes and algorithms executed by machine learning systems using databases and classifying according to instructions created by specialist designers.

Using McQuail's historical storytelling method, I specifically look at the challenge for the field in the context of a global pandemic alongside an infodemic, at a time when the whole world faces the consequences of recurrent lockdowns, social distancing measures, and institutional pressures to stay at home. Media studies and (mass) communication research, while having a distinct narrative, as a field has only just begun to articulate its relevance to society - we have only just started to tell our story. Using developments in understanding the self as a research tool, the implementation of integrative research designs, and calls for engaged and public scholarship, the paper outlines challenges and opportunities for what we can do with our field.","Deuze, M.",Central European Journal of Communication,https://doi.org/10.51480/1899-5101.14.1(28).1,646

Transforming traditional classroom-based learning and paper work-based assessment are limited due to the lack of interaction between students and instructor when blended learning system is promoted. As a results, there is a concern raised on the effectiveness of achieving learning outcomes. Furthermore, with the closure of schools and universities campus, conversion of traditional face-to face learning to e-learning is necessary to avoid the spread of COVID-19 virus. This paper shares the experience of using web-based assignment from the instructor's view and students' perspective on the usage experience. Qualitative and quantitative methods were employed in data collection and analysis. It was found that the time for instructor used to conduct the course is reduced and average 58.5% of students showed positive feedback towards the implementation of the web-based assignment as compared to traditional method. However, there are limitations in the technical context that required enhancement in the systems.","Yu, L. J.; Lai, N. Y. G.; Liew, C.

181743,Continuation of Teaching and Learning during the Covid-19: A Case Study on the Geographical Education Department,2021,"The severity of viral infections can vary widely, from asymptomatic cases to complications leading to hospitalizations and death. Milder cases, despite being more prevalent, often go undocumented and their public health impact unaccounted for. We estimated the burden of influenza-like-illness (ILI) by leveraging the widespread use of commercial activity trackers. Analysing data from 15,382 US participants who reported ILI symptoms during the 2018-2019 flu season (before the COVID-19 pandemic) and who had high-density wearable sensor data at symptom onset, we estimated an overall nationwide reduction in mobility equivalent to 257 billion steps lost due to ILI symptoms. This finding reflects significant changes in routines, mobility, and employment and is equivalent to 15% of the active US population becoming completely immobilized for 1 day. Moreover, ~60% of this impact occurred among individuals who sought no medical care, who would otherwise be invisible to healthcare and public health reporting systems. We validated our measure against self-reported measures of disease severity. We believe this method has applications for public health, healthcare, and clinical research, from estimating costs of lost productivity at population scale, to measuring effectiveness of anti-ILI treatments, to monitoring recovery after acute viral syndromes, such as during long COVID.","Mezlini, A.; Shapiro, A.; Daza, E.

Non-clinical evaluation of candidate drug combinations via the relapsing mouse model (RMM) is an important step in regimen development, through which candidate regimens that provide the greatest decrease in probability of relapse following treatment in mice may be identified for further development. Although RMM studies are a critical tool to evaluate regimen efficacy, making comprehensive “apples to apples” comparisons of regimen performance in the RMM has been a challenge, in large part due to the need to evaluate and adjust for variability across studies arising from differences in design and execution. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a model-based meta-analysis on data for 17 unique regimens obtained from a total of 1592 mice across 28 RMM studies. Specifically, a mixed-effects logistic regression model was developed that described the treatment duration-dependent probability of relapse for each regimen and identified relevant covariates contributing to inter-study variability. Using the model, covariate-normalized metrics of interest, namely treatment duration required to reach 50% and 10% relapse probability, were derived and used to compare relative regimen performance. Overall, the model-based meta-analysis approach presented herein enables cross-study comparison of efficacy in the RMM, and provides a framework whereby data from emerging studies may be analyzed in the context of historical data to aid in selecting candidate drug combinations for clinical evaluation as TB drug regimens.","Berg, Alexander; Clary, James; Hanna, Debra; Nuermberger, Eric; Lenaerts, Anne; Ammerman, Nicole; Ramey, Michelle; Hartley, Dan; Hermann, David",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.13.460195,646
181948,The Use of Hypermedia Technologies in Higher Education Institutions during Covid Lockdown,2021,"Achieving food security for all citizens is an important policy issue in India. While the existing data based on socio-economic surveys provide accurate estimates of food insecurity indicators at state and national level, due to small sample sizes, the surveys cannot be used directly to produce reliable estimates at the district or lower administrative levels. The availability of reliable and representative disaggregated measures of food insecurity is necessary for effective policy planning and monitoring, as food insecurity is often distributed unevenly within relatively small areas. This article explores a small area estimation (SAE) approach to derive reliable and representative estimates of food insecurity prevalence (FIP), gap (FIG), and severity (FIS) among people in different districts of the rural areas of the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain (EIGP) region by linking the latest round of available data from the Household Consumer Expenditure Survey collected by the National Sample Survey Office of India as well as the latest available Indian Population Census data. District-specific food insecurity indicators such as FIP, FIG, and FIS were estimated based on a recommended threshold of per capita caloric intake of 2400 kilocalories per day, as defined by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Spatial maps showing district-level inequality in the distribution of the indicators of food insecurity among the population in the EIGP region are also produced. Our disaggregated estimates can provide district-specific focused insights into food insecurity to policy analysts and decision-makers, and could thereby prove to be useful and relevant to the U.N.

182363,Italian reception policies and pandemic: From exclusion to abandonment,2021,"To improve future decisions, people should seek information based on the value of information (VOI), which depends on the current evidence and the reward structure of the upcoming decision. When additional evidence is supplied, people should update VOI to adjust subsequent information seeking, but the neurocognitive mechanisms of this updating process remain unknown. We used a modified beads task to examine how the VOI is represented and updated in the human brain. We theoretically derived, and empirically verified, a normative prediction that the VOI depends on decision evidence and is biased by reward asymmetry. Using fMRI, we found that the subjective VOI is represented in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Critically, this VOI representation was updated when additional evidence was supplied, showing that DLPFC dynamically tracks the up-to-date VOI over time. These results provide new insights into how humans adaptively seek information in the service of decision making.","Kobayashi, Kenji; Lee, Sangil; Filipowicz, Alexandre L.

Despite enormous efforts, it is not clear how SARS-CoV2 adapts and evolves in a clonal background. Laboratory research is hindered by high biosafety demands. How-ever, the rapid sequence availability opened doors for bioinformatics. Using different bioinformatics programs, we investigated 6305 sequences for clonality, expressions strategies, and evolutionary dynamics. Results showed high nucleotide identity of 99.9% among SARS-CoV2 indicating clonal evolution and genome. High sequence identity and phylogenetic tree concordance were obtained with isolates from different regions. In any given tree topology, ~50% of isolates in a country formed country-specific sub-clusters. However, abundances of subtle overexpression strategies were found including transversions, signature-sequences and slippery-structures. Five different short tracks dominated with identical location patterns in all genomes where Slippery-4 AAGAA was the most abundant. Interestingly, transversion and transition substitutions mostly affected the same amino acid residues implying compensatory changes. To ensure these strategies were independent of sequence clonality, we simultaneously examined sequence homology indicators;tandem-repeats, restriction-site, and 3′ UTR, 5′ UTR-caps and stem-loop locations in addition to stringent alignment parameters for 100% identity which all confirmed stability. Nevertheless, two rare events;a rearrange-ment in two SARS-CoV2 isolates against betacoronavirus ancestor and a polymorphism in S gene, were detected. Thus, we report on abundance of transversions, slippery sequences, and ON/OFF molecular structures, implying adaptive expressions had occurred, despite clonal evolution and genome stability. Furthermore, functional validation of the point mutations would provide insights into mechanisms of SARS-CoV2 virulence and adaptation.","Said, K.

189206,[Myositis].,1955,"Elevated serum uric acid level has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients. Several angiotensin II receptor blockers exhibit differential effects on regulation of serum uric acid level in humans. We have demonstrated that some angiotensin II receptor blockers trans-stimulate the uptake of uric acid by human URAT1 and others inhibit the transport of uric acid mediated by human URAT1, OAT1, OAT3 and MRP4 in vitro. This study investigated the effects of candesartan, pratosartan and telmisartan on renal handling of uric acid in rats in vivo and in vitro. Candesartan (0.1 mg/kg) significantly decreased the urinary excretion of uric acid and increased the plasma uric acid concentration. The kidney candesartan level after low-dose treatment is close to that required to trans-stimulate uric acid uptake in vitro. Pratosartan exhibited dose-dependent hypouricemic and uricosuric effects, while telmisartan showed no effects on plasma uric acid level. Furthermore, we confirmed the effects of the tested drugs on uric acid transport by rat renal brush border membrane transporter(s) and basolateral Oat1 and Oat3. Effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers in rats may be mainly determined by their intrinsic effects (cis-inhibition and trans-stimulation) on uric acid reabsorption transporter(s) and their pharmacokinetic properties in rats.","Li, Yan; Sato, Masanobu; Yanagisawa, Yuichi; Mamada, Hideaki; Fukushi, Akimasa; Mikami, Kentaro; Shirasaka, Yoshiyuki; Tamai, Ikumi",Drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18762713/,646

The aneurysms predominantly involved the M1 segment in two cases, bifurcation in four cases, and M2 in five cases. Four M2 fusiform aneurysms were treated with parent artery sacrifice after balloon occlusion test. The seven unruptured aneurysms and one ruptured one were treated with stent-assisted coiling. The post-operation and long-term follow-up angiographic and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Endovascular coiling was performed successfully in all 11 cases. All four M2 fusiform cases using parent artery occlusion strategy achieved complete occlusion of aneurysms. In the seven cases with stent-assisted coiling, four were completely occluded, two were partially occluded and one remained small residue. Mild perioperative complications occurred in six patients. The follow-up angiography taken at a mean of 13.5 months of eight patients showed that seven aneurysms remained stable or improved and one M1 aneurysms relapsed and needed further treatment.

We have therefore examined the plasma macromolecules on the nasal mucosa at different time points. The study comprised 20 subjects who had been inoculated (day 0) with coronavirus intranasally. Ten subjects remained healthy and 10 developed common cold with significant symptoms from day 2 to day 6. Starting on day 3 at 8.00 h and repeated at 4 h intervals until 4.00 h on day 4, nasal lavages were carried out by employment of a nasal pool-device which fills the entire unilateral nasal cavity and gently but effectively irrigates its surface. Lavage fluid levels of albumin (Mw 69,000 D) and fibrinogen (Mw 340,000 D) were determined. In the healthy subjects the levels of albumin and fibrinogen remained low throughout the experiment, however, with mean peak values of the two proteins occurring at 4.00 h (p < 0.05 compared to daytime nadir at 16.00 h). In subjects with common cold both albumin (p < 0.05) and fibrinogen (p < 0.01) exhibited marked variation with individual and mean peak levels recorded at 8.00 h day 3, and 4.00 h day 4. These mean peak values were 5-20 times higher (p < 0.01 - p < 0.05) than the mean levels recorded in these subjects at the other time periods. The present data indicate a marked day-night difference in the occurrence of plasma proteins on the airway surface in common cold, whereas in health the difference is much less. We conclude that different-sized plasma proteins may accumulate on the mucosa in healthy airways during late night hours and that in common cold this nocturnal accumulation may be considerably increased.","Greiff, L; Akerlund, A; Andersson, M; Svensson, C; Alkner, U; Persson, C G",Acta oto-laryngologica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8820357/,646

A true measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is unusual, and how estimation formulae (EstForm) perform in such individuals is unclear. We characterized renal function and hemodynamics in severely obese individuals, assessing the reliability of EstForm. METHODS We measured GFR (mGFR) by iohexol plasma clearance, renal plasma flow (RPF) by 123I-ortho-iodo-hippurate, basal and stimulated vascular renal indices, endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation using flow-mediated dilation (FMD) as well as metabolic and hormonal profile in morbid, otherwise healthy, obese subjects. RESULTS Compared with mGFR, the better performing EstForm was CKD-EPI (5.3 ml/min/1.73 m2 bias by Bland-Altman analysis). mGFR was directly related with RPF, total and incremental glucose AUC, and inversely with PTH and h8 cortisol. Patients with mGFR below the median shown significantly higher PTH and lower vitamin D3. Basal or dynamic renal resistive index, FMD, pulse wave velocity were not related with mGFR. In an adjusted regression model, renal diameter and plasma flow remained related with mGFR (R2 = 0.67), accounting for 15% and 21% of mGFR variance, respectively. CONCLUSIONS CKD-EPI formula should be preferred in morbid obesity; glucose increments during oral glucose tolerance test correlate with hyperfiltration; RPF and diameter are independent determinants of mGFR; slightly high PTH values, frequent in obesity, might influence mGFR.","Vitolo, Edoardo; Santini, Eleonora; Salvati, Antonio; Volterrani, Duccio; Duce, Valerio; Bruno, Rosa Maria; Solini, Anna",Obesity facts,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27701167/,646

Multiple case series managed by a single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) have been published. The objective of this study is to describe the short-term outcomes of SILC in our institution. METHODS A retrospective review was done for 51 patients who underwent SILC between 2009-2012. The operative time, surgical technique, conversion rate, and postoperative complications were reported. RESULTS SILC was performed for 51 patients, all women, with a mean age of 35.6 years (range=19-62). Their body mass index(BMI) ranged from 16.8-35.6 kg m2 with a mean of 20.4. Twelve patients (23.52 %) had acute cholecystitis. The mean operating time was 58.6 minutes (range=45-95 min). Incidents were encountered in 6 patients (11.76%) and were related to intraoperative bleeding. There was a single conversion to the standard laparoscopic procedure (1.9%) and in 5 cases an accessory needle grasp was used (9.8%). Two patients (3.9%)presented postoperative complications (wound infections) and the mean hospital stay was 1.6 days. CONCLUSIONS SILC is feasible and provides a promising alternative to natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery for scarless laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, routine application of this novel technique requires an evaluation of its safety and cost effectiveness in larger studies.","Cotirlet, A; Nedelcu, M; Popa, E; Anghel, R; Rau, S; Motoc, I; Tincu, E",Chirurgia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25560499/,646

METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of the patients treated at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital between January 2010 and September 2014, who underwent FDS placement for intracranial aneurysm. The patients received dual-antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin) 5 days before and 3-6 months after the procedure and then aspirin alone for 6-9 months. An ischemic complication was defined as a sudden focal neurological deficit documented on diffusion-weighted images. RESULTS Eighty-six consecutive patients were included. Three (3.5%) patients treated with the Pipeline embolization device experienced a delayed acute ischemic stroke (2 cases of perforator/side-wall branch infarction and 1 case of thromboembolic stroke) with an average delay of 384 days (4 months, 20 months, and 13 months, respectively). The aneurysm locations were the left superior cerebellar artery, the right anterior choroid artery, and the left internal carotid artery (paraclinoid segment), respectively. The complications occurred after the patients had completed the antiaggregation protocol, except for Patient 1, who was receiving aspirin alone because of a spontaneous hematoma. At the acute phase, no in-stent thromboses were found on digital subtraction angiography. In Patient 2, the treated anterior choroid artery was occluded 20 months after the procedure. In Patient 3, a focal stenosis (approximately 40%) of the distal aspect of the FDS, probably caused by intimal hyperplasia, was seen. CONCLUSIONS Very late ischemic complications after FDS treatment were observed in 3.5% of the cases in the authors' series, some of which occurred as late as more than 1 year after placement.","Guédon, Alexis; Clarençon, Frédéric; Di Maria, Federico; Rosso, Charlotte; Biondi, Alessandra; Gabrieli, Joseph; Rojas, Patricia; Chiras, Jacques; Sourour, Nader",Journal of neurosurgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26824382/,646
200952,Becket’s Cap and the Broken Sword. Jacques de Vitry’s English Mitre in Context,2020,"OBJECTIVE Workforce recruitment and retention challenges are being experienced in public health as in other Canadian health sectors. While there are many nurses working in public health, little research has been done about their job satisfaction. Job satisfaction is linked to recruitment, retention and positive client outcomes. The purpose of this research was to examine the relationships between three modifiable work environment factors (autonomy, control-over-practice, and workload) and Canadian public health nurses' (PHNs) job satisfaction. METHODS Data were from the 2005 National Survey of the Work and Health of Nurses (response rate, 79.7%; 18,676 nurses). Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used for this secondary analysis. Findings were discussed with practicing PHNs, policy-makers and researchers from across Canada at a knowledge translation (KT) 'Think-Tank'. RESULTS Among the 271 PHNs, 53.5% reported being 'very satisfied' with their jobs. The interaction between autonomy and workload was a significant predictor of PHNs' job satisfaction, (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.99, p < 0.01) as was the interaction between age and workload (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.01, p < 0.01). Think-Tank participants selected priority areas for application to public health practice, management and research. CONCLUSION Despite being an important practice factor, this is the first study to reveal the negative influence of PHNs' autonomy when in interaction with an excessive workload. Significant workload findings and the presence of generational differences suggest the need for development of workload measurement tools and public health human resource strategies tailored to a multi-generational workforce.","Graham, Karen R; Davies, Barbara L; Woodend, A Kirsten; Simpson, Jane; Mantha, Shannon L",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22164552/,646

In parallel to the international collaborative study led by WHO and United States, a retrospective study on the cohort of German persons staying at Hotel 'M' was conducted. The inclusion criteria covered a period from 21 February to 3 March 2003 to allow the detection of cases possibly due to environmental contamination. In the twenty-one German guests traced as having stayed at Hotel ""M"" during this period, one case of laboratory confirmed SARS was found. The case history suggests that close vicinity to the index patient may have played a role in transmission.

These three subsets are identical in these two gene populations and have five important properties: (i) the property of maximal (20 trinucleotides) circular code for X0 (resp. X1, X2) allowing to retrieve automatically the frame 0 (resp. 1, 2) in any region of the gene without start codon; (ii) the DNA complementarity property C (e.g. C(AAC) = GTT): C(T0) = T0, C(T1) = T2 and C(T2) = T1 allowing the two paired reading frames of a DNA double helix simultaneously to code for amino acids; (iii) the circular permutation property P (e.g. P(AAC) = ACA): P(X0) = X1 and P(X1) = X2 implying that the two subsets X1 and X2 can be deduced from X0; (iv) the rarity property with an occurrence probability of X0 = 6 x 10(-8); and (v) the concatenation properties in favour of an evolutionary code: a high frequency (27.5%) of misplaced trinucleotides in the shifted frames, a maximum (13 nucleotides) length of the minimal window to retrieve automatically the frame and an occurrence of the four types of nucleotides in the three trinucleotide sites. In Discussion, a simulation based on an independent mixing of the trinucleotides of T0 allows to retrieve the two subsets T1 and T2. Then, the identified subsets T0, T1 and T2 replaced in the 2-letter genetic alphabet {R, Y} (R = purine = A or G, Y = pyrimidine = C or T) allow to retrieve the RNY model (N = R or Y) and to explain previous works in the alphabet {R, Y}. Then, these three subsets are related to the genetic code. The trinucleotides of T0 code for 13 amino acids: Ala, Asn, Asp, Gln, Glu, Gly, Ile, Leu, Lys, Phe, Thr, Tyr and Val. Finally, a strong correlation between the usage of the trinucleotides of T0 in protein genes and the amino acid frequencies in proteins is observed as six among seven amino acids not coded by T0, have as expected the lowest frequencies in proteins of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.","Arquès, D G; Michel, C J",Bio Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9429747/,646

201923,COVID-19 Lockdown Education: The Importance of Structure in a Suddenly Changed Learning Environment,2021,"The pathway of West Nile flavivirus early internalization events was mapped in detail in this study. Overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of Eps15 strongly inhibits West Nile virus (WNV) internalization, and pharmacological drugs that blocks clathrin also caused a marked reduction in virus entry but not caveola-dependent endocytosis inhibitory agent, filipin. Using immunocryoelectron microscopy, WNV particles were seen within clathrin-coated pits after 2 min postinfection. Double-labeling immunofluorescence assays and immunoelectron microscopy performed with anti-WNV envelope or capsid proteins and cellular markers (EEA1 and LAMP1) revealed the trafficking pathway of internalized virus particles from early endosomes to lysosomes and finally the uncoating of the virus particles. Disruption of host cell cytoskeleton (actin filaments and microtubules) with cytochalasin D and nocodazole showed significant reduction in virus infectivity. Actin filaments are shown to be essential during the initial penetration of the virus across the plasma membrane, whereas microtubules are involved in the trafficking of internalized virus from early endosomes to lysosomes for uncoating. Cells treated with lysosomotropic agents were largely resistant to infection, indicating that a low-pH-dependent step is required for WNV infection. In situ hybridization of DNA probes specific for viral RNA demonstrated the trafficking of uncoated viral RNA genomes to the endoplasmic reticulum.","Chu, J J H; Ng, M L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15367621/,646

204649,Turn crisis into opportunity in response to COVID-19: experience from a Chinese University and future prospects,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of adverse events (AE) in chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine users. METHODS: We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), using MEDLINE (2010-2020) and EMBASE (2010-2020) databases, reporting AE in chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine users during treatment for lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, malaria and COVID-19. The protocol for this systematic review is registered at the PROSPERO database (CRD42020197938). The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-Bias tool and relevant data were extracted though a customized data collection form, independently, by two authors. The IRR of AE was estimated using a random-effect model meta-analysis and heterogeneity was evaluated by T2 and I2. Subgroup analysis was performed, and publication bias was assessed by funnel-plot. RESULTS: Forty-six RCTs met our eligibility criteria and were included in our analysis (23132 patients). There was not a single death attributed to chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine use in the included RCTs. The IRR of general AE during antimalarial use was 1.15 [CI 95% 1.01-1.31]. COVID-19 patients treated with either antimalarial presented an 83% and 165% higher risk of developing general and gastrointestinal AE, respectively, in comparison with controls. The use of antimalarial increased the risk of developing dermatological AE by 92% in malarial studies and reduced by 65% in lupus studies. We did not find a significatively higher risk of cardiovascular nor ophthalmological AE in antimalarial users. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reinforces that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have a good safety profile though caution is advised when using higher than usual doses in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Edington, Fernando Luiz Barros; Gadellha, Sandra Rocha; Santiago, Mittermayer Barreto",Eur J Intern Med,,646

Hospitalization days, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid positive days, minimal lymphocyte count, and occurrence time were collected and comparatively analyzed. Correlations between minimal lymphocyte count and hospitalization days as well as SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positive days were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were included in the study, with 16 in the diabetic group and 47 in the non-diabetic group. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, we observed lower minimal lymphocyte count (0.67 ± 0.36 * 109/L vs. 1.30 ± 0.54 * 109/L, adjusted P = 0.001), earlier occurrence of the minimal lymphocyte count (2.68 ± 2.33 days vs. 5.29 ± 4.95 days, adjusted P = 0.042), and longer hospitalization time (20.44 ± 5.24 days vs. 17.11 ± 4.78 days, adjusted P = 0.047) in the diabetic group than in the non-diabetic group. There was a negative correlation between minimal lymphocyte count and hospitalization days (R = -0.600, P < 0.05) as well as SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positive days (R = -0.420, P < 0.05).

To assess whether emergency general surgeons (EGS) could provide a 'Hot Gall Bladder Service' (HGS) with an acceptable outcome. Patients and Methods: This was a prospective HGS observational study that was protocol driven with strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and secure online data collection in a district general hospital between July 2018 and June 2019. A weekly dedicated theatre slot was allocated for this list. Results: Of the 143 referred for HGS, 86 (60%) underwent ELC which included 60 (70%) women. Age, ASA and body mass index was 54* (18-85) years, II* (I-III) and 27* (20-54), respectively. 86 included 46 (53%), 19 (22%), 19 (22%) and 2 (3%) patients presenting with acute calculus cholecystitis, gallstone pancreatitis, biliary colic, and acalculus cholecystitis, respectively. 85 (99%) underwent LC with a single conversion. Grade of surgical difficulty, duration of surgery and post-operative stay was 2* (1-4) 68* (30-240) min and 0* (0-13) day, respectively. Eight (9%) required senior surgical input with no intra-operative complications and 2 (2%) 30-day readmissions. One was post-operative subhepatic collection that recovered uneventfully and the second was pancreatitis, imaging was clear requiring no further intervention. Conclusion: In the current climate of NHS financial crunch, COVID pandemic and significant pressure on inpatient beds: Safe and cost-effective HGS can be provided by the EGS with input from upper GI/HPB surgeons (when required) with acceptable morbidity and a satisfactory outcome. *Median.","Imtiaz, Mohammad; Prakash, Samip; Iqbal, Sara; Fernandes, Roland; Shah, Ankur; Shrestha, Ashish K; Basu, Sanjoy",Journal of minimal access surgery,,646

OBJECTIVE: To develop a clinical instrument for evaluating symptoms of COVID-19 mild-to-moderate forms. METHODS: COVID-19 patients were recruited from EpiCURA Hospital (Belgium). They completed the COVID-19 Symptom Index (CSI) twice to assess the test-retest reliability. The internal consistency was evaluated with Cronbach's alpha. CSI was completed by healthy subjects to assess the internal validity. Patients completed CSI 6 weeks after the COVID-19 resolution to evaluate the responsiveness to change. RESULTS: Ninety-four COVID-19 patients and 55 healthy individuals completed the evaluations. Symptoms associated with the higher severity score were fatigue, headache and myalgia. The Cronbach's alpha value was 0.801, indicating high internal consistency. The test-retest reliability was adequate (rs = 0.535, p = .001). The correlation between CSI total score and SNOT-22 was high (rs = 0.782; p < .001), supporting a high external validity. COVID-19 patients reported significant higher CSI score than healthy individuals, suggesting an adequate internal validity.

211959,Pandemic control: getting to the heart of unintended consequences,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 induces a marked prothrombotic state with varied clinical presentations, including acute coronary artery occlusions leading to ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, while STEMI on electrocardiogram (ECG) is not always associated with acute coronary occlusion, this diagnostic uncertainty should not delay cardiac catheterization. CASE REPORTS: We present 2 cases of patients with COVID-19 that presented with STEMI on ECG. While both patients underwent cardiac catheterization, a delay in time to intervention in the patient found to have acute coronary artery occlusion may have contributed to a poor outcome. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: These cases highlight the fact that while not all COVID-19 patients with STEMI on ECG will have acute coronary artery occlusions, there is continued need for prompt percutaneous coronary intervention during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic.","Ehrman, Robert R; Brennan, Erin E; Creighton, Terrence; Ottenhoff, Jakob; Favot, Mark J",J. emerg. med,,646

We develop a comprehensive, non-Markovian state transition model, which is validated through accurate prediction of the daily death toll for two epicenters: Wuhan, China and Lombardy, Italy. The model enables prediction of COVID-19 deaths in various scenarios. For example, if treatment priorities had been given to younger patients, the death toll in Wuhan and Lombardy would have been reduced by 10.4\% and 6.7\%, respectively. The strategy depends on the epidemic scale and is more effective in countries with a younger population structure. Analyses of data from China, South Korea, Italy, and Spain suggest that countries with less per capita ICU medical resources should implement this strategy in the early stage of the pandemic to reduce mortalities.","Zeng, Ying-Qi; Zeng, Lang; Tang, Ming; Liu, Ying; Liu, Zong-Hua; Lai, Ying-Cheng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13953v1.pdf,646
215269,How the coronavirus pandemic affects the digital resilience of employees,2020,"In contemporary societies, computer use by children is a necessity and thus highly prevalent. Using computers for long hours is related to a higher risk of computer-related muscular disorders like forward head posture (FHP) and neck pain (NP). Deep cervical flexor (DCF) muscles are important head-on-neck posture stabilizers; thus, their training may lead to an improvement in FHP and NP. The aim of this study was to determine if 4 weeks of DCF training is effective in alleviating NP, improving FHP, and functional status in adolescent children using computers regularly, a pretest-posttest experimental group design was used. Subjects were randomly assigned into the experimental group (receiving DCF training and postural education) and the control group (receiving postural education only). 30 subjects with a mean age of 15.7 ± 1.725 years with NP and FHP using computers regularly participated in the study. Dependent variables were measured on day 1 (at baseline) and after 4 weeks of training. Photographic analysis was used for measuring FHP, visual analog scale for NP intensity, and neck disability index for functional status. Data analysis showed that in both groups, no significant improvement occurred in FHP. In both groups, there was a significant improvement in functional status and NP. There was no significant difference between both groups for FHP and NP. There was a significant improvement in functional status in the experimental group in comparison to the control group. Four weeks of DCF training does not cause a significant improvement in FHP in 13 to 18 years old adolescent children using computers regularly.","Sikka, Isha; Chawla, Chandan; Seth, Shveta; Alghadir, Ahmad H; Khan, Masood",Biomed Res Int,,646

The susceptible-exposed-asymptomatic but infectious-symptomatic and infectious (severe infected population + mild infected population)-recovered-deceased (SEAI(I1+I2)RD) physical model for unsupervised learning and two types of supervised learning, namely, fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and wavelet neural-network PID learning, are used to build a predictive-control system model that enables self-learning artificial intelligence (AI)-based control. After parameter setting, the data entering the model are predicted, and the value of the data set at a future moment is calculated. PID controllers are added to ensure that the system does not diverge at the beginning of iterative learning. To adapt to complex system conditions and afford excellent control, a wavelet neural-network PID control strategy is developed that can be adjusted and corrected in real time, according to the output error.","Liu, Xian-Xian; Hu, Shimin; Fong, Simon James; Crespo, Rubén González; Herrera-Viedma, Enrique",Phys. biol,,646

As of December 3, 2020, the total number of cases reported are around 65,527,000 contagions worldwide, and 1,524,000 deaths affecting 218 countries and territories. In this scenario, Spain is one of the countries that has suffered in a hard way, the ongoing epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, namely COVID-19 disease. In this paper, we present the utilization of phenomenological epidemic models to characterize the two first outbreak waves of COVID-19 in Spain. The study is driven using a two-step phenomenological epidemic approach. First, we use a simple generalized growth model to fit the main parameters at the early epidemic phase; later, we apply our previous finding over a logistic growth model to that characterize both waves completely. The results show that even in the absence of accurate data series, it is possible to characterize the curves of case incidence, and construct a short-term forecast of 60 days in the near time horizon, in relation to the expected total duration of the pandemic.","López, Miguel; Peinado, Alberto; Ortiz, Andrés",PLoS One,,646
218007,Menstimulasi Praktik Gereja Rumah Di Tengah Pandemi COVID-19,2020,"Understanding the relationship between infection and stroke has taken on new urgency in the era of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This association is not a new concept, as several infections have long been recognized to contribute to stroke risk. The association of infection and stroke is also bidirectional. Although infection can lead to stroke, stroke also induces immune suppression which increases risk of infection. Apart from their short-term effects, emerging evidence suggests that poststroke immune changes may also adversely affect long-term cognitive outcomes in patients with stroke, increasing the risk of poststroke neurodegeneration and dementia. Infections at the time of stroke may also increase immune dysregulation after the stroke, further exacerbating the risk of cognitive decline. This review will cover the role of acute infections, including respiratory infections such as COVID-19, as a trigger for stroke; the role of infectious burden, or the cumulative number of infections throughout life, as a contributor to long-term risk of atherosclerotic disease and stroke; immune dysregulation after stroke and its effect on the risk of stroke-associated infection; and the impact of infection at the time of a stroke on the immune reaction to brain injury and subsequent long-term cognitive and functional outcomes. Finally, we will present a model to conceptualize the many relationships among chronic and acute infections and their short- and long-term neurological consequences. This model will suggest several directions for future research.","Elkind, Mitchell S V; Boehme, Amelia K; Smith, Craig J; Meisel, Andreas; Buckwalter, Marion S",Stroke,,646

Searches in eight bibliographic databases were performed to systematically review the evidence on the prevalence, risk factors, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among HCW. Ninety-seven studies (All published in 2020), including 230,398 HCW, met the inclusion criteria. From the screened HCW using RT-PCR and the presence of antibodies, the estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11% (95%CI; 7%-15%) and 7% (95% CI; 4%-11%), respectively. The most frequently affected personnel were the nurses (48%. 95%CI; 41%-56%), while most of the COVID-19 positive medical personnel were working in hospitalization/non-emergency wards during the screening (43%, 95%CI;28%-59%). Anosmia, fever and myalgia were identified as the only symptoms associated with HCW SARS-CoV-2 positivity.

They can be adopted and applied to outdoor environments. However, many studies have shown that these two disinfectants are toxic to fishes and aquatic non-target organisms (primary producers and macroinvertebrates). The global market of these disinfectants will increase in coming years due to COVID-19. Therefore, it is urgent to highlight the toxicities of these disinfectants. The main findings of this article allow the community to develop a new strategy to protect the environment against the hazardous effects of disinfectants. Therefore, we use the ""toxicity calculated ratio (TC ratio)"" that refers to the fold increase or decrease in the toxicities reported in the literature (NOEC, LOEC, LC50 and EC50) relative to the WHO-recommended dose of HP and HC. The calculated TC ratios are valuable for policy makers to formulate the regulations to prevent disinfectant exposure in the environment. Our results were collected via PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis) guidelines and showed that the TC ratios are from the single digits to several thousand-fold lower than the HP and HC recommended dose, which means these disinfectants are potentially dangerous to non-target organisms. The results also showed that HP and HC are toxic to the growth and reproduction of non-target organisms. Therefore, we recommend policymakers formulate protocols for critical assessment and monitoring of the environment-especially on non-target organisms in water bodies located in and around disinfectant-exposed areas to safeguard the environment in the future.","Subpiramaniyam, Sivakumar",Sci Total Environ,,646

We used paired t-tests or &#967;2 tests to evaluate the significance of differences in consumption patterns of 12 major food groups and beverages across educational levels, between sexes, and before and after COVID-19 lockdown. During the COVID-19 lockdown, significant decreases were observed in the frequency of intake of rice, meat, poultry, fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, soybean products, and dairy products, with significant sex differences (females consuming more rice, fresh vegetables and fruit and less meat, poultry, soybean and dairy products than males). Significant increases were observed in the frequency of consumption of wheat products, other staple foods, and preserved vegetables, with males consuming these foods more frequently than females. Graduate students consumed most foods more frequently except rice and other staple foods and preserved vegetables. The frequency of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption had decreased while frequency of tea drinking had increased.

In this report, every patient vital signs must be monitored in order to prevent a potential decline in the level of health from the patient. One of the symptoms observed in this monitoring is a change in body temperature. This monitoring should be carried out without touching the patient’s skin to reduce potential risks of droplets that contain the virus from spreading. This work proposes an idea related to non-contact temperature monitoring which is suitable to use in this pandemic condition. This idea realization process by building a data storage terminal for body temperature scans that is mobile, cheap and has a large storage capacity. This mobile terminal is an integration of the MLX90614 a temperature sensor series, Arduino UNO and Telegram apps. In addition, the communication process between the sensor and the Telegram apps utilizes the GPRS cellular network services. Before arriving at the Telegram apps, this data will pass through gateway site which acts as a collector and relay. In the process of sending the temperature data is then converted into two body temperature categories, normal temperature and abnormal temperature. Based on the trial results that have been carried out, this system consumes 2A of current and 5V of voltage. The communication time duration between the temperature data acquisition system and the collector site is 28 seconds.

SARS-CoV-2 has a predilection for the pulmonary system and can result in serious pneumonia necessitating hospitalisation. Computed tomography (CT) chest scans of patients with severe symptoms, show signs of multifocal bilateral ground or ground-glass opacities (GGO) associated with consolidation areas with patchy distribution. However, it is less well known that both asymptomatic and mild symptomatic patients may exhibit similar lung changes. Presumably, the various pathological changes in the lungs may increase the risk of adverse events during diving (e.g., lung barotrauma, pulmonary oedema, etc.), thus these lung manifestations need to be considered prior to allowing resumption of diving. Presently, it is not known how the structural changes in the lungs develop and to what extent they resolve, in particular in asymptomatic carriers and patients with mild disease. However, current evidence indicates that a month of recovery may be too short an interval to guarantee complete pulmonary restitution even after COVID-19 infections not demanding hospital care.","Elia, Antonis; Gennser, Mikael",Diving Hyperb Med,,646

In the United States, Medtronic Diabetes shifted from occasional to 100% virtual training on all diabetes devices in mid-March 2020. We studied the outcomes of virtual training on the MiniMed&#8482; 670 G hybrid closed-loop system in type 1 diabetes. Methods: From March 20, 2020, to April 22, 2020 (intra-COVID-19), virtual training on the MiniMed 670 G system was completed using Zoom with satisfaction captured through online post-training surveys. Training efficiency was measuring by the days between the date of product shipment and the date of the first and final trainings. Patient satisfaction with training on the MiniMed 670 G was determined by Net Promotor Score® (NPS®). Uploads from CareLink&#8482; Personal and CareLink Professional and calls to the Medtronic 24-h technical support team requesting educational/software assistance and/or help with health care provider telehealth visits were recorded. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) results were measured using the CareLink Personal database. All results except for the Zoom satisfaction survey were compared with data from January 20, 2020, to February 22, 2020, (Pre-COVID-19) when training was performed in-person. Results: The CGM metrics were comparable between pre- and intra-COVID-19 training. The Zoom video conferencing application had 98% satisfaction. The NPS rose from 78 to 84. The time between the pump shipment and the first and last (automode) training was significantly reduced from 14 ± 7 days to 11 ± 5 days (P < 0.001) and from 19 ± 7 days to 15 ± 15 days (P < 0.01), respectively. There was a decrease in the calls for educational assistance to the technical support team but an increase in requests for login and software installation support. Conclusions: Virtual training of individuals with diabetes on the MiniMed 670 G system resulted in high satisfaction and short-term glycemic results comparable with in-person training.","Vigersky, Robert A; Velado, Kevin; Zhong, Alex; Agrawal, Pratik; Cordero, Toni L",,,646

230806,"Crises in international education, and government responses: a comparative analysis of racial discrimination and violence towards international students",2021,"High-volume testing of clinical specimens for sexually transmitted diseases is performed frequently by a process known as group testing. This algorithmic process involves testing portions of specimens from separate individuals together as one unit (or ""group"") to detect diseases. Retesting is performed on groups that test positively in order to differentiate between positive and negative individual specimens. The overall goal is to use the least number of tests possible across all individuals without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy. One of the most efficient group testing algorithms is array testing. In its simplest form, specimens are arranged into a grid-like structure so that row and column groups can be formed. Positive-testing rows/columns indicate which specimens to retest. With the growing use of multiplex assays, the increasing number of diseases tested by these assays, and the availability of subject-specific risk information, opportunities exist to make this testing process even more efficient. We propose specific specimen arrangements within an array that can reduce the number of retests needed when compared with other array testing algorithms. We examine how to calculate operating characteristics, including the expected number of tests and the SD for the number of tests, and then subsequently find a best arrangement. Our methods are illustrated for chlamydia and gonorrhea detection with the Aptima Combo 2 Assay. We also provide R functions to make our research accessible to laboratories.","Bilder, Christopher R; Tebbs, Joshua M; McMahan, Christopher S",Stat. med,,646

We hypothesize that severe coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients may show an alteration in baroreflex-mediated heart rate changes in response to arterial hypotension. A pilot study was conducted to assess the response to hypotension in relation to continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) in critically ill patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (from February to April 2020) and in critically ill non-COVID-19 patients with sepsis (from February 2018 to February 2020). The endpoint was a change in the heart rate in response to CVVHDF-induced hypotension. The association between COVID-19 status and heart rate change was estimated using linear regression. The study population included 6 COVID-19 patients (67% men; age 58 (53-64) years) and 12 critically ill non-COVID-19 patients (58% men; age 67 (51-71) years). Baseline characteristics, laboratory findings, hemodynamic parameters, and management before CVVHDF-induced hypotension were similar between the two groups, with the exception of a higher positive end-expiratory pressure and doses of propofol and midazolam administered in COVID-19 patients. Changes in the heart rate were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients as compared to critically ill non-COVID-19 patients (-7 (-9; -2) vs. 2 (2;5) bpm, p = 0.003), while the decrease in mean arterial blood pressure was similar between groups. The COVID-19 status was independently associated with a lower change in the heart rate (-11 (-20; -2) bpm; p = 0.03). Our findings suggest an inappropriate heart rate response to hypotension in severe COVID-19 patients compared to critically ill non-COVID-19 patients.","Verney, Charles; Legouis, David; Voiriot, Guillaume; Fartoukh, Muriel; Labbé, Vincent",,,646
230956,Personal account of remote teaching for tertiary education in a South African context,2020,"Antibody detection is essential to establish exposure, infection, and immunity to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to perform epidemiological studies. The worldwide urge for new diagnostic tools to control the pandemic has led to a quick incorporation in clinical practice of the recently developed serological assays. However, as only few comparative studies have been published, there is a lack of data about the diagnostic accuracy of currently available assays. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy to detect Ig G, Ig M+A, and/or IgA anti SARS-CoV-2 of 10 different assays: lateral flow card immunoassays, 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and 3 chemiluminescent particle immunoassays (CMIA). Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 as gold standard, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were determined. Each assay was tested in 2 groups, namely, positive control, formed by 50 sera from 50 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with positive RT-PCR; and negative control, formed by 50 sera from 50 patients with respiratory infection non-COVID-19. Sensitivity range of the 10 assays evaluated for patients with positive COVID-19 RT-PCR was 40-77% (65-81% considering IgG plus IgM). Specificity ranged 83-100%. VPP and VPN were respectively 81-100% and 61.6-81%. Among the lateral flow immunoassays, the highest sensitivity and specificity results were found in Wondfo® SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test. ELISA IgG and IgA from EUROIMMUN® were the most sensitive ELISA. However, poor results were obtained for isolated detection of IgG. We found similar sensitivity for IgG with SARS-CoV-2 for Architect by Abbott® and ELISA by Vircell®. Results obtained varied widely among the assays evaluated. Due to a better specificity, overall diagnostic accuracy of the assays evaluated was higher in case of positive result. On the other side, lack of antibody detection should be taken with care because of the low sensitivity described. Highest diagnostic accuracy was obtained with ELISA and CMIAs, but they last much longer.","Gutiérrez-Cobos, Ainhoa; Gómez de Frutos, Sara; Domingo García, Diego; Navarro Lara, Eva; Yarci Carrión, Ayla; Fontán García-Rodrigo, Leticia; Fraile Torres, Arturo Manuel; Cardeñoso Domingo, Laura",Eur. j. clin. microbiol. infect. dis,,646

We fit our model to daily U.S. state-level COVID-19 death counts and exploit our estimates to produce various policy counterfactuals. While the restrictions imposed by some states inhibited a significant number of virus deaths, we find that more than two-thirds of U.S. COVID-19 deaths could have been prevented by late September 2020 had the federal government imposed federal mandates as early as some of the earliest states did.

235650,The transformation process from in-campus classes into online classes due to the COVID-19 situation -- the case of higher education institutions in Kosovo,2021-03-14,"Background & objectives: Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has globally affected 195 countries. In India, suspected cases were screened for SARS-CoV-2 as per the advisory of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The objective of this study was to characterize SARS-CoV-2 sequences from three identified positive cases as on February 29, 2020. Methods: Throat swab/nasal swab specimens for a total of 881 suspected cases were screened by E gene and confirmed by RdRp (1), RdRp (2) and N gene real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions and next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis, molecular characterization and prediction of B- and T-cell epitopes for Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences were undertaken. Results: Three cases with a travel history from Wuhan, China, were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. Almost complete (29,851 nucleotides) genomes of case 1, case 3 and a fragmented genome for case 2 were obtained. The sequences of Indian SARS-CoV-2 though not identical showed high (~99.98%) identity with Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (accession number: NC 045512). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Indian sequences belonged to different clusters. Predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be concentrated in the S1 domain of spike protein, and a conformational epitope was identified in the receptor-binding domain. The predicted T-cell epitopes showed broad human leucocyte antigen allele coverage of A and B supertypes predominant in the Indian population. Interpretation & conclusions: The two SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained from India represent two different introductions into the country. The genetic heterogeneity is as noted globally. The identified B- and T-cell epitopes may be considered suitable for future experiments towards the design of vaccines and diagnostics. Continuous monitoring and analysis of the sequences of new cases from India and the other affected countries would be vital to understand the genetic evolution and rates of substitution of the SARS-CoV-2.","Yadav, Pragya D; Potdar, Varsha A; Choudhary, Manohar Lal; Nyayanit, Dimpal A; Agrawal, Megha; Jadhav, Santosh M; Majumdar, Triparna D; Shete-Aich, Anita; Basu, Atanu; Abraham, Priya; Cherian, Sarah S",Indian J Med Res,,646

Scientific evidence based on research spanning over 25 years indicates that Ayurveda rasayana such as Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera;WS) can be a potential candidate for management of COVID-19. Ashwagandha can offer multi-target effects in inflammatory conditions by restoring immune homeostasis. Possible role and immune targets of ashwagandha in prophylaxis of COVID-19 are shown. It is suggested that, under current exceptional circumstances, interdisciplinary research on evidence-based Ayurveda interventions should be prioritized with an open mind for prophylaxis and add-on treatment of SARSCoV-2 infection.","Bhushan, Patwardhan Preeti Chavan-gautam Manish Gautam Girish Tillu Arvind Chopra Sunil Gairola Suresh Jadhav",Current Science,,646
237488,Innovations in teacher education at the time of COVID19: an Australian perspective: JET,2020,"The main protease (Mpro) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is one focus of drug development efforts for COVID-19. Here, we show that interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) is a useful and effective tool for creating Mpro complexes. We make these tools and models freely available. iMD-VR provides an immersive environment in which users can interact with MD simulations and so build protein complexes in a physically rigorous and flexible way. Recently, we have demonstrated that iMD-VR is an effective method for interactive, flexible docking of small molecule drugs into their protein targets (Deeks et al. PLoS One 2020, 15, e0228461). Here, we apply this approach to both an Mpro inhibitor and an oligopeptide substrate, using experimentally determined crystal structures. For the oligopeptide, we test against a crystallographic structure of the original SARS Mpro. Docking with iMD-VR gives models in agreement with experimentally observed (crystal) structures. The docked structures are also tested in MD simulations and found to be stable. Different protocols for iMD-VR docking are explored, e.g., with and without restraints on protein backbone, and we provide recommendations for its use. We find that it is important for the user to focus on forming binding interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, and not to rely on using simple metrics (such as RMSD), in order to create realistic, stable complexes. We also test the use of apo (uncomplexed) crystal structures for docking and find that they can give good results. This is because of the flexibility and dynamic response allowed by the physically rigorous, atomically detailed simulation approach of iMD-VR. We make our models (and interactive simulations) freely available. The software framework that we use, Narupa, is open source, and uses commodity VR hardware, so these tools are readily accessible to the wider research community working on Mpro (and other COVID-19 targets). These should be widely useful in drug development, in education applications, e.g., on viral enzyme structure and function, and in scientific communication more generally.","Deeks, Helen M; Walters, Rebecca K; Barnoud, Jonathan; Glowacki, David R; Mulholland, Adrian J",J Chem Inf Model,,646

This universal SARS-CoV-2 enrichment probe set contains 502 120 nt single-stranded DNA biotin-labeled probes designed based on all available SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences and it can be used to enrich for SARS-CoV-2 sequences without prior knowledge of type or subtype. Following the CDC health and safety guidelines, marked enrichment was demonstrated in a virus strain sample from cell culture, three nasopharyngeal swab samples (cycle threshold [Ct ] values: 32.36, 36.72, and 38.44) from patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (positive control) and four throat swab samples from patients without COVID-19 (negative controls), respectively. Moreover, based on these high-quality sequences, we discuss the heterozygosity and viral expression during coronavirus replication and its phylogenetic relationship with other selected high-quality samples from the Genome Variation Map. Therefore, this universal SARS-CoV-2 enrichment probe system can capture and enrich SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences selectively and effectively in different samples, especially clinical swab samples with a relatively low concentration of viral particles.","Wen, Shaoqing; Sun, Chang; Zheng, Huanying; Wang, Lingxiang; Zhang, Huan; Zou, Lirong; Liu, Zhe; Du, Panxin; Xu, Xuding; Liang, Lijun; Peng, Xiaofang; Zhang, Wei; Wu, Jie; Yang, Jiyuan; Lei, Bo; Zeng, Guangyi; Ke, Changwen; Chen, Fang; Zhang, Xiao",J. med. virol,,646

238412,Financial recovery strategies for restaurants during COVID-19: Evidence from the US restaurant industry,2021,"Social stigma is the spoilation of the social image of an individual, which leads to the social disapproval of the individual by the community. Patients of many diseases like HIV, deafness, and reproductive disorders often face social disproval. Head & neck cancer survivors perceived stigma due to the mutilation that occurred after surgical treatment procedures. The novel coronavirus is a recently emerged zoonotic viral agent that affects the respiratory system of humans. Following its outbreak from the Wuhan city of China, the COVID-19 spreaded fiercely around the globe, forming a pandemic. Since COVID-19 is a contagious disease with no available treatment, social distancing is considered as the best strategy to prevent the geometric spread of infection. With the social distancing model, the head & neck cancer survivors along with the various other stakeholders perceived stigma being a high-risk group for COVID-19 infection. As the pool of caregivers is diminished due to pandemic, head & neck cancer survivors face increased social isolation and perceived stigma in asking for help from relatives. At the time of the pandemic, social support is critical to fighting against the disease. Social distancing should be maintained along with communication with the patients through calls, text, and online social platforms. It is not wise to stigmatize disease as, in that case, patients who are infected with the disease will try to hide it and avoid seeking medical care. With the promotion of social distancing, it is crucial to convey awareness regarding not to stigmatize the disease.","Goyal, Atul Kumar; Bakshi, Jaimanti; Panda, Naresh K; Kapoor, Rakesh; Vir, Dharam; Kumar, Krishan; Aneja, Pankaj",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,646

AIMS: We tried to find the current role, availability and need of ventilators in the COVID-19 pandemic and the role of applied innovative technologies is assessed. METHODS: We have done a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Research Gate in the second week of April 2020. RESULTS: We found in our review that there is an acute shortage of the ventilators and the manpower to operate these sophisticated machines. There is significant deficiency in the production and supply chain of the ventilators. Many of the seriously ill patients who require hospitalization may need ventilator support. Non-invasive ventilation is not recommended in these patients. CONCLUSION: As the respiratory illness due to COVID-19 pandemic spreads worldwide, health care systems are facing the tough challenges of acquiring ventilators to support patients. All steps involved in the supply chain management of ventilators are being escalated to produce more ventilators for the coronavirus frontline.

The initial search, cutoff date February 2020, targeting “gig economy” returned a sample of 378 papers dealing with the topic. The subsequent analysis, employing the science mapping method and relating software (SciMAT), allowed to query the body of research dealing with gig economy in detail. The value added by this paper is fourfold. First, the broad literature on gig economy is mapped and the nascent synergies relating both to research opportunities and economic implications are identified and highlighted. Second, the findings reveal that while research on gig economy proliferates, the distinction between “platform” and “gig” economy frequently remains blurred in the analysis. This paper elaborates on this issue. Third, it is highlighted that the discussion on gig economy is largely dispersed and a clearer research agenda is needed to streamline the discussion to improve its exploratory and explanatory potential. This paper suggests ways of navigating this issue. Fourth, by mapping the existing research on gig economy and highlighting its caveats, the way toward a comprehensive research agenda in the field is highlighted.","Malik, Radosław Visvizi Anna Skrzek-Lubasińska Małgorzata",Sustainability,,646
241156,Toward greener and pandemic-proof cities: North American cities policy responses to Covid-19 outbreak,2021,"Numerous viruses hijack cellular protein trafficking pathways to mediate cell entry or to rearrange membrane structures thereby promoting viral replication and antagonizing the immune response. Adaptor protein complexes (AP), which mediate protein sorting in endocytic and secretory transport pathways, are one of the conserved viral targets with many viruses possessing AP-interacting motifs. We present here different mechanisms of viral interference with AP complexes and the functional consequences that allow for efficient viral propagation and evasion of host immune defense. The ubiquity of this phenomenon is evidenced by the fact that there are representatives for AP interference in all major viral families, covered in this review. The best described examples are interactions of human immunodeficiency virus and human herpesviruses with AP complexes. Several other viruses, like Ebola, Nipah, and SARS-CoV-2, are pointed out as high priority disease-causative agents supporting the need for deeper understanding of virus-AP interplay which can be exploited in the design of novel antiviral therapies.","Strazic Geljic, Ivana; Kucan Brlic, Paola; Musak, Lucija; Karner, Dubravka; Ambriovic-Ristov, Andreja; Jonjic, Stipan; Schu, Peter; Rovis, Tihana Lenac",Int. j. mol. sci.

The cross-sectional data were collected using the time-lag design to avoid the common method bias as much as possible. Regression results using structural equation modeling show that the internalized stigmatization of epicenter travel experiences may have positive relationships with mental health problems (i.e., anxiety, depression, and shame), and such relationships can be moderated by social support. Specifically, the positive relationships between internalized stigmatization and mental health problems are buffered/strengthened when social support is at a high/low level. The findings of this study suggest that, in this epidemic, people who have epicenter travel experience could be affected by internalized stigmatization, no matter whether they have ever got infected.","Li, Jiannan; Liang, Wenqi; Yuan, Bocong; Zeng, Guojun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,646

The Ministry of Health mandated isolation of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and instructed healthcare institutions to make necessary arrangements. As the second Israeli hospital to establish a COVID-19 department, this article describes our experience in its rapid establishment, while maintaining normal medical center activities. SETTING: Establishing the COVID-19 department involved planning, set-up, and implementations phases, each one based on knowledge available regarding the pandemic and established medical standards for isolation and protection of patients and staff. Wherever possible, new innovative technologies were utilized to provide maximum protection for both patients and staff, together with special online training that was developed for medical teams. RESULTS: A COVID-19 department was successfully established on the hospital campus, remote from other ongoing patient activities. A novel methodology of disease-adapted medicine was implemented successfully among the department's medical staff, who underwent training tailored to expected clinical scenarios. The COVID-19 department is receiving patients, with no contamination of medical personnel to date. A recent survey of COVID-19 patients revealed a very high patient satisfaction rate. CONCLUSION: Based on the experience described herein and lessons learned, the hospital is preparing for a potential large-scale COVID-19 wave, aimed at full readiness through utilization of a fortified underground emergency hospital to treat up to 900 COVID-19 patients, and establishment of versatile in-hospital infrastructure for quick conversion from standard conditions to COVID-19 appropriate conditions.","Berger, Gidon; Horowitz, Netanel A; Shachor-Meyouhas, Yael; Gepstein, Vardit; Hussein, Khetam; Weismann, Avi; Hyams, Gila; Geffen, Yuval; Mekel, Michal; Halberthal, Michael",Am J Disaster Med,,646

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted. Fifty-nine patients with COVID-19 admitted to Bazhong Central Hospital and Dazhou Central Hospital from January 27th to February 9th, 2020 were selected as the subjects. The data of demography, epidemiology, laboratory examination, chest CT and related clinical treatment were collected. According to the severity of the disease, the patients were divided into three types: mild, general and severe types, and the differences of the above indices among different clinical types were compared. RESULTS: (1) General information and epidemiology: 31 cases (52.5%) were male, 28 cases (47.5%) were female, the average age was (42.0±16.4) years old, and the patients over 40 years old accounted for the largest proportion (35 cases, 59.3%). The proportion of clinical type was 72.9% (43 cases) in general type, and 62.7% (37 cases) were imported type. With the increase of disease severity, the average age of patients also showed a significant increase trend [the age of the mild, general and severe patients were (30.9±13.6), (42.7±15.3), (55.8±18.9) years old, P < 0.01]. The proportion of patients with more than one basic disease in severe patients was significantly higher than those in mild and general patients [66.7% (4/6) vs. 20.0% (2/10), 9.3% (4/43), both P < 0.05]. In the distribution of clinical symptoms, the proportion of severe patients with chest distress/dyspnea was significantly higher than those in mild and general patients [66.7% (4/6) vs. 10.0% (1/10), 11.6% (5/43), both P < 0.05]. (2) Laboratory examination index: the total number of white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophils count (NEU), C-reactive protein (CRP) in severe patients were higher than those in mild patients and general patients [WBC (×109/L): 7.21±4.35 vs. 5.85±1.69, 5.43±2.04; NEU (×109/L): 6.09±4.43 vs. 3.95±1.45, 3.54±1.83; CRP (mg/L): 16.00 (8.20, 46.43) vs. 5.00 (0.00, 16.13), 15.00 (3.13, 28.58)], the albumin (Alb) level in severe patients was lower than those in mild and general patients (g/L: 38.00±5.35 vs. 49.23±5.27, 39.81±2.15, both P < 0.05), while the hemoglobin (Hb) level in mild patients was higher than that in severe and general patients (g/L: 155.2±12.1 vs. 141.3±6.8, 131.1±11.7, both P < 0.05). (3) Chest imaging: the CT manifestations of typical cases were single or multiple ground glass shadows. With the progress of the disease, the focus gradually increased, the scope gradually expanded, and multiple solid shadows of lung lobes were involved. (4) Treatment: all patients received at least 2 kinds of antiviral therapy, and the application rate of Interferon and Ribavirin in severe patients were higher than those in mild and general patients [100.0% (6/6) vs. 80.0% (8/10), 97.7% (42/43); 83.3% (5/6) vs. 0% (0/10), 20.9% (9/43); all P < 0.05]. (5) Prognosis: until March 6th 2020, 50 patients (84.8%) were discharged from the hospital after rehabilitation, and the remaining 9 patients were still under treatment, none deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of severe patients with chest distress/dyspnea is higher, the older the patients are and the more basic diseases are, the more likely they are to develop into severe type. High resolution chest CT could be considered for suspected cases or even fever patients, which may show the progress of the disease.","Li, Biliang; Zhang, Shiguo; Luo, Shilin; Liu, Chun; Jia, Weijun; Jiang, Huating; Dai, Qian",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,,646

This has potential implications for the growing population of CI users who are &#8805;65 years of age because of age-related auditory temporal processing deficits. The goal of this study was to measure temporal processing ability in a gap detection task in younger, middle-aged, and older CI users and to determine the relative contributions of chronological age and peripheral neural survival to performance. Single-electrode gap detection thresholds (GDTs) were measured using direct stimulation at five electrode locations and three electrical stimulation rates. The relationship between peripheral status (e.g., electrode-to-neural interface) and GDTs was assessed by the slope of the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) amplitude growth function. Results showed that ECAP slope was the strongest subject-level predictor of GDTs. Steeper ECAP slopes, which are partially indicative of better peripheral function, were associated with better GDTs in younger participants. However, ECAP slope significantly interacted with stimulation rate and age, suggesting that ECAP slopes were not predictive of GDTs in middle-aged and older participants at some stimulation rates. ECAP slope was also related to age, with middle-aged and older participants exhibiting relatively shallow slopes and smaller ranges of slopes compared with younger participants. This pattern of ECAP results limited the evaluation of the independent effects of aging per se and peripheral status on temporal processing ability.","Shader, Maureen J; Gordon-Salant, Sandra; Goupell, Matthew J",Trends Hear,,646

Studies have shown that umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (uMSCs) could alleviate PF; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. METHODS: The therapeutic effects of uMSC-derived extracellular vesicles (uMSC-EVs) on PF were evaluated using bleomycin (BLM)-induced mouse models. Then, the role and mechanism of uMSC-EVs in inhibiting myofibroblast differentiation were investigated in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: Treatment with uMSC-EVs alleviated the PF and enhanced the proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells in BLM-induced mice, thus improved the life quality, including the survival rate, body weight, fibrosis degree, and myofibroblast over differentiation of lung tissue. Moreover, these effects of uMSC-EVs on PF are likely achieved by inhibiting the transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) signaling pathway, evidenced by decreased expression levels of TGF-ß2 and TGF-ßR2. Using mimics of uMSC-EV-specific miRNAs, we found that miR-21 and miR-23, which are highly enriched in uMSC-EVs, played a critical role in inhibiting TGF-ß2 and TGF-ßR2, respectively. CONCLUSION: The effects of uMSCs on PF alleviation are likely achieved via EVs, which reveals a new role of uMSC-EV-derived miRNAs, opening a novel strategy for PF treatment in the clinical setting.","Shi, Liyan; Ren, Jing; Li, Jiping; Wang, Dongxu; Wang, Yusu; Qin, Tao; Li, Xiuying; Zhang, Guokun; Li, Chunyi; Wang, Yimin",Stem Cell Res Ther,,646

In this paper, we draw from the emerging evidence on behaviour adoption during diverse public health emergencies to develop a framework that contextualises behaviour adoption vis-à-vis a combination of top-down, intermediary and bottom-up approaches. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study, we operationalise the contextual framework to demonstrate how these three approaches differ in terms of their implementation, underlying drivers of action, enforcement, reach and uptake. We illustrate how blended strategies that include all three approaches can help accelerate and sustain protective behaviours that will remain important even when safe and effective vaccines become more widely available. As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic and prepares to respond to (re)emerging public health threats, our contextual framework can inform the design, implementation, tracking and evaluation of comprehensive public health and social measures during health emergencies.","Jalloh, Mohamed F; Nur, Aasli A; Nur, Sophia A; Winters, Maike; Bedson, Jamie; Pedi, Danielle; Prybylski, Dimitri; Namageyo-Funa, Apophia; Hageman, Kathy M; Baker, Brian J; Jalloh, Mohammad B; Eng, Eugenia; Nordenstedt, Helena; Hakim, Avi J",,,646

We discuss 'beneficial' exposomes (green/natural outdoor spaces, sun exposure, healthy diets and features of built environments) that could synergise with physical activity to prevent metabolic dysfunction, particularly that related to lifestyle diseases of obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Physical activity may also reduce the capacity of some adverse exposomes, specifically those with significant levels of air pollution, to contribute towards metabolic dysfunction. Other exposomes, such as those experienced during pandemics (including COVID-19), potentially limit opportunities for physical activity, and there may be unexpected combined effects of physical activity with other infections (e.g. adenovirus-36) on metabolic health. Finally, we discuss how environments could be better optimised to create exposomes that promote the health benefits of physical activity and likely future directions of this research field.","Gorman, Shelley; Larcombe, Alexander N; Christian, Hayley E",J Endocrinol,,646

250625,Genomic variations of sars-cov-2 and effect of various factors on covid-19,2020,"Infectious Bronchitis (IB) is an economically important avian disease that considerably threatens the global poultry industry. This is partly, as a result of its negative consequences on egg production, weight gain as well as mortality rate.The disease is caused by a constantly evolving avian infectious bronchitis virus whose isolates are classified into several serotypes and genotypes that demonstrate little or no cross protection. In order to curb the menace of the disease therefore, broad based vaccines are urgently needed. The aim of this study was to develop a recombinant DNA vaccine candidate for improved protection of avian infectious bronchitis in poultry. Using bioinformatics and molecular cloning procedures, sets of monovalent and bivalent DNA vaccine constructs were developed based on the S1 glycoprotein from classical and variants IBV strains namely, M41 and CR88 respectively. The candidate vaccine was then encapsulated with a chitosan and saponin formulated nanoparticle for enhanced immunogenicity and protective capacity. RT-PCR assay and IFAT were used to confirm the transcriptional and translational expression of the encoded proteins respectively, while ELISA and Flow-cytometry were used to evaluate the immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine following immunization of various SPF chicken groups (A-F). Furthermore, histopathological changes and virus shedding were determined by quantitative realtime PCR assay and lesion scoring procedure respectively following challenge of various subgroups with respective wild-type IBV viruses. Results obtained from this study showed that, groups vaccinated with a bivalent DNA vaccine construct (pBudCR88-S1/M41-S1) had a significant increase in anti-IBV antibodies, CD3+ and CD8+ T-cells responses as compared to non-vaccinated groups. Likewise, the bivalent vaccine candidate significantly decreased the oropharyngeal and cloacal virus shedding (p < 0.05) compared to non-vaccinated control. Chickens immunized with the bivalent vaccine also exhibited milder clinical signs as well as low tracheal and kidney lesion scores following virus challenge when compared to control groups. Collectively, the present study demonstrated that bivalent DNA vaccine co-expressing dual S1 glycoprotein induced strong immune responses capable of protecting chickens against infection with both M41 and CR88 IBV strains. Moreso, it was evident that encapsulation of the vaccine with chitosan-saponin nanoparticle further enhanced immune responses and abrogates the need for multiple booster administration of vaccine. Therefore, the bivalent DNA vaccine could serve as efficient and effective alternative strategy for the control of IB in poultry.","Bande, Faruku; Arshad, Siti Suri; Bejo, Mohd Hair; Omar, Abdul Rahman; Moeini, Hassan; Khadkodaei, Saeid; Wei, Tan Sheau; Keong, Yeap Swee; Abba, Yusuf; Anka, Ibrahim Abubakar",Microb Pathog,,646

Objective: Estimate incidence of breakthrough infections and assess associations with risk factors using self-reported data from a large NC population sample. Design: Prospective observational cohort study utilizing daily online survey data to capture information about COVID-19 symptoms, testing, and vaccination status. Setting: Six health care systems in North Carolina with data collected between January 15, 2021 and September 24, 2021. Participants: Adult study participants who reported full vaccination with a COVID-19 mRNA or J&J non-replicating viral vector vaccine (n = 16,020). Exposures: Potential community exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcome and Measures: Self-reported breakthrough infection. Results: SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination was self-reported in 1.9% of participants, with an incidence rate of 7.3 per 100,000 person-years. Younger age (45-64 vs. 18-44: HR (95% CI) = 0.65 (0.51-0.82); 65+ vs. 18-44: HR (95% CI) = 0.59 (0.39-0.90)), and vaccination with J&J Ad26.COV2.S were associated with a higher risk of breakthrough infection compared to vaccination with Pfizer BNT162b2 (Ad26.COV2.S vs. BNT162b2: HR (95% CI) = 2.23 (1.40-3.56)), while participants vaccinated with mRNA-1273 (mRNA-1273 vs. BNT162b2: HR (95% CI) = 0.69 (0.50-0.96) and those residing in urban counties experienced a lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection compared with those from suburban (HR (95% CI) = 1.39 (1.01-1.90)) or rural (HR (95% CI) = 1.57 (1.16-2.11)) counties. There was no significant association between breakthrough infection and participant sex, race, healthcare worker status, prior COVID-19 infection, routine mask use, or overall vaccination rate in the county of residence. Conclusions and Relevance: This NC community-based observational study showed that the proportion of the cohort who self-report breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections was 7.3 events per 100,000 person-years. Younger adults, those vaccinated with J&J Ad26.COV2.S, and those residing in suburban or rural counties were at higher risk of breakthrough infections and should be targeted for additional risk mitigation strategies to decrease community transmission.","Uschner, Diane; Bott, Matthew; Santacatterina, Michele; Gunaratne, Mihili P; Fette, Lida; Burke, Brian K; Strylewicz, Greg; Edelstein, Sharon L; Lagarde, William H; Miller, Kristen E; Weintraub, William S; Yukich, Joshua; Tapp, Hazel; Schieffelin, John; Ahmed, Amina; Berry, Andrea A; Munawar, Iqra; Seals, Austin L; Williamson, John; Herrington, David; Sanders, John W; Runyon, Michael; Partnership, - COVID-19 Community Research",,,646

252220,Tantangan Penatalaksanaan Stemi Di Pandemi COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The first confirmed case of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in the United States was reported from the state of Washington in January, 2020. By March, 2020, New York City had become the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States. METHODS: We tracked all patients with confirmed coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) infection admitted to intensive care units (ICU) at Montefiore Medical Center (Bronx, NY). Data were obtained through manual review of electronic medical records. Patients had at least 30 days of follow-up. RESULTS: Our first 300 ICU patients were admitted March 10 through April 11, 2020. The majority (60.7%) of patients were men. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was documented in 91.7% of patients; 91.3% required mechanical ventilation. Prone positioning was employed in 58% of patients and neuromuscular blockade in 47.8% of mechanically-ventilated patients. Neither intervention was associated with decreased mortality. Vasopressors were required in 77.7% of patients. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was present on admission in 40.7% of patients, and developed subsequently in 36.0%; 50.9% of patients with AKI received renal replacement therapy (RRT). Overall 30-day mortality rate was 52.3%, and 55.8% among patients receiving mechanical ventilation. In univariate analysis, higher mortality rate was associated with increasing age, male sex, hypertension, obesity, smoking, number of comorbidities, AKI on presentation, and need for vasopressor support. A representative multivariable model for 30-day mortality is also presented, containing patient age, gender, body mass index, and AKI at admission. As of May 11, 2020, 2 patients (0.7%) remained hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality in critical illness associated with COVID-19 is high. The majority of patients develop ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation, vasopressor-dependent shock, and AKI. The variation in mortality rates reported to date likely reflects differences in the severity of illness of the evaluated populations.","Chand, Sudham; Kapoor, Sumit; Orsi, Deborah; Fazzari, Melissa J; Tanner, Tristan G; Umeh, Genevieve C; Islam, Marjan; Dicpinigaitis, Peter V",J Intensive Care Med,,646

254509,Editorial 'the Value of Disorientation',2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 lacks sentience and can only be spread through human behaviour. Government instructions to the general public include: (a) limiting time spent outside the home, (b) staying more than 1 m away from people outside the household at all times, and (c) maintaining hand hygiene. Current evidence suggests high rates of adherence to such instructions, but interventions to sustain adherence to government instructions in the long term can only be developed if we know why people do or do not adhere to them. The aims were to assess levels of public adherence to government instructions to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but more importantly to gauge why people were or were not adhering to instructions. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 2252 adults who were representative of the UK population. Data were analysed descriptively, and using one-sample t-tests, within-participants ANOVA and multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The sample reported mostly adhering to UK government instructions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, with 5% or fewer people reporting active resistance to instructions. People generally reported high levels of capability, opportunity and motivation to follow the instructions, but perceived relatively few physical and social opportunities. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that better adherence was associated with older age, being a woman, having a white ethnic background, and with perceiving greater levels of capabilities, opportunities and motivations. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions targeted at people with black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, men and younger people that focus on increasing capabilities, providing greater opportunities and boosting motivations are needed to support continued adherence to government instructions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Further research is required to track changes in people's capabilities, opportunities, motivations and behaviours in response to the ongoing emergency, any changes in government instructions, and to adapt the present procedures to other emergency situations.","Armitage, Christopher J; Keyworth, Chris; Leather, Jessica Z; Byrne-Davis, Lucie; Epton, Tracy",BMC Public Health,,646
254804,Critical review of the Threats affecting the building of Critical Infrastructure Resilience,2021,"Since the onslaught of SARS-CoV-2, the research community has been searching for a vaccine to fight against this virus. However, during this period, the virus has mutated to adapt to the different environmental conditions in the world and made the task of vaccine design more challenging. In this situation, the identification of virus strains is very much timely and important task. We have performed genome-wide analysis of 10664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries to identify and prepare a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) dataset of SARS-CoV-2. Thereafter, with the use of this SNP data, the advantage of hierarchical clustering is taken care of in such a way so that Average Linkage and Complete Linkage with Jaccard and Hamming distance functions are applied separately in order to identify the virus strains as clusters present in the SNP data. In this regard, the consensus of both the clustering results are also considered while Silhouette index is used as a cluster validity index to measure the goodness of the clusters as well to determine the number of clusters or virus strains. As a result, we have identified five major clusters or virus strains present worldwide. Apart from quantitative measures, these clusters are also visualized using Visual Assessment of Tendency (VAT) plot. The evolution of these clusters are also shown. Furthermore, top 10 signature SNPs are identified in each cluster and the non-synonymous signature SNPs are visualised in the respective protein structures. Also, the sequence and structural homology-based prediction along with the protein structural stability of these non-synonymous signature SNPs are reported in order to judge the characteristics of the identified clusters. As a consequence, T85I, Q57H and R203M in NSP2, ORF3a and Nucleocapsid respectively are found to be responsible for Cluster 1 as they are damaging and unstable non-synonymous signature SNPs. Similarly, F506L and S507C in Exon are responsible for both Clusters 3 and 4 while Clusters 2 and 5 do not exhibit such behaviour due to the absence of any non-synonymous signature SNPs. In addition to all these, the code, SNP dataset, 10664 labelled SARS-CoV-2 strains and additional results as supplementary are provided through our website for further use.","Ghosh, Nimisha; Saha, Indrajit; Sharma, Nikhil; Nandi, Suman; Plewczynski, Dariusz",Virus Res,,646

However, the literature on preexisting respiratory diseases and COVID-19, accounting for other possible confounders, is limited. The primary objective of this study was to determine the association between preexisting respiratory diseases and severe disease outcomes among COVID-19 patients. Secondary aim was to investigate any correlation between smoking and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This is a multihospital retrospective cohort study on 1871 adult patients between March 10, 2020, and June 30, 2020, with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The main outcomes of the study were severe disease outcomes i.e. mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. During statistical analysis, possible confounders such as age, sex, race, BMI, and comorbidities including, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, any history of cancer and prior liver disease, chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease on dialysis, hyperlipidemia and history of prior stroke, were accounted for. RESULTS: A total of 1871 patients (mean (SD) age, 64.11 (16) years; 965(51.6%) males; 1494 (79.9%) African Americans; 809 (43.2%) with &#8805; 3 comorbidities) were included in the study. During their stay at the hospital, 613 patients (32.8%) died, 489 (26.1%) needed mechanical ventilation, and 592 (31.6%) required ICU admission. In fully adjusted models, patients with preexisting respiratory diseases had significantly higher mortality (adjusted Odds ratio (aOR), 1.36; 95% CI, 1.08-1.72; p = 0.01), higher rate of ICU admission (aOR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.07-1.68; p = 0.009) and increased need for mechanical ventilation (aOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.07-1.72; p = 0.01). Additionally, patients with a history of smoking had significantly higher need for ICU admission (aOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.55; p = 0.03) in fully adjusted models. CONCLUSION: Preexisting respiratory diseases are an important predictor for mortality and severe disease outcomes, in COVID-19 patients. These results can help facilitate efficient resource allocation for critical care services.","Lohia, Prateek; Sreeram, Kalyan; Nguyen, Paul; Choudhary, Anita; Khicher, Suman; Yarandi, Hossein; Kapur, Shweta; Badr, M Safwan",Respir Res,,646

Beyond its biological role as a regulator of the innate immune response, IL-1 is involved in stress and chronic inflammation, therefore it is responsible for several pathological conditions. In particular, IL-1 is known to exert a critical function in malignancies, influencing the tumor microenvironment and promoting cancer initiation and progression. Thus, it orchestrates immunosuppression recruiting pro-tumor immune cells of myeloid origin. Furthermore, new recent findings showed that this cytokine can be directly produced by tumor cells in a positive feedback loop and contributes to the failure of targeted therapy. Activation of anti-apoptotic signaling pathways and senescence are some of the mechanisms recently proposed, but the role of IL-1 in tumor cells refractory to standard therapies needs to be further investigated.","Gelfo, Valerio; Romaniello, Donatella; Mazzeschi, Martina; Sgarzi, Michela; Grilli, Giada; Morselli, Alessandra; Manzan, Beatrice; Rihawi, Karim; Lauriola, Mattia",,,646

For this reason, it is necessary to check compatibility data of the glove with the disinfectant product in glove disinfection. AIM: To test the resistance of nitrile gloves to different disinfectant solutions. METHODS: To analyze the resistance of nitrile gloves, firstly, the gloves were exposed to the disinfectant. The exposure to the disinfectant was analyzed comparing the control group (untreated glove) with the others. For the tensile test, the thickness of each test specimen was measured with a micrometer .100% powder-free nitrile gloves, composed of nitrile Butadiene rubber (NBR) compounds, were used. The 7 most commonly used disinfectant solutions in the healthcare field were selected. FINDINGS: A bleach solution did decrease breaking load, although to a lesser extent than disinfectants that contain ethanol in their composition. CONCLUSION: With the methods used, we have determined the influence that various disinfectants have on nitrile gloves, finding that those which contain alcohol cause a decrease in breaking load.","Garrido-Molina, José Miguel; Márquez-Hernández, Verónica V; Alcayde-García, Alfredo; Ferreras-Morales, Carlos Alberto; García-Viola, Alba; Aguilera-Manrique, Gabriel; Gutiérrez-Puertas, Lorena",J. hosp. infect,,646

However, no information is available on the frequency of nasopharyngeal swab collection and positivity depending on comorbidities. Using a cross-sectional design, we assessed the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 tests and of positivity in the general population of the 530,000-inhabitant Italian province of Udine and in subgroups affected by chronic conditions in the first weeks of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Anonymous health databases were used as source of information to identify persons with 14 chronic conditions. From laboratory records we assessed the likelihood of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and the frequency of positivity from February 29 to April 19, 2020, i.e., 7 weeks from the first case detected in the study area. Sex and age-stratified proportions were calculated in comorbidity subgroups. Multivariate regression was used to adjust for confounders. In the province, 236,623 persons had &#8805;1 chronic condition; 869 had positive tests. Persons with comorbidities were tested more than the others. However, most chronic conditions were not significantly associated with the prevalence of positivity, except psychiatric and neurological diseases and diabetes. In conclusion, despite more frequent testing, patients with most chronic diseases where equally likely to be diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 as the general population. Chronic patients should adhere to general recommendations for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, but ad hoc restrictions do not seem necessary.","Valent, Francesca; Mazzilis, Giada; Doimo, Anna; Pipan, Corrado",Health Policy,,646

The qualitative study aims to explore the lived experiences, beliefs, feelings, and challenges faced by Pakistani migrant physicians working in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An exploratory phenomenological approach was used to collate data on experiences expressed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Purposive and snowball sampling was used to target participants, which were doctors of Pakistani origin involved in the direct care and management of COVID-19 patients in different NHS hospitals of the United Kingdom. Semi-structured, in-depth telephonic interviews were conducted with study participants in May 2020. Data analysis was done parallel with data collection by using an inductive qualitative approach. RESULTS: We recruited ten frontline physicians. Four theme categories emerged from the data analysis: 1) Working across borders and cultures, 2) Role of beliefs for coping with stress and fear, 3) Passion and profession, and 4) Scaffolding the Pakistani health system. Overall, the results show that the participants received limited professional support, in terms of counseling and psychological rehabilitation. Instead, they had to use self-management strategies to cope with the situation. CONCLUSION: The intensive work exhausted participants physically and emotionally. They were holding a lot of grief and hurt inside, but still, healthcare professionals showed the spirit of professional dedication to overcome difficulties. Although currently coping with their emotional problems, comprehensive professional support should be made available to cater to the wellbeing of frontline physicians.","Saleem, Javeria; Ishaq, Muhammad; Zakar, Rubeena; Suddahazai, Imran Hussain Khan; Fischer, Florian",BMC Health Serv Res,,646

It was circulated to ISAC members in December 2019. Results were collated according to the UN human development index (HDI). 81 responses were gathered from 31 different countries. 84% of institutions reported the availability of any test 24/7. In more developed countries, this was more for respiratory viruses, whereas in high and medium/low developed countries, it was for HIV and viral hepatitis. Only 37% of those carrying out rapid tests measured the impact. There is no 'one-size fits all' solution to RDTs: the requirements must be tailored to the healthcare setting in which they are deployed and there are many factors that should be considered prior to this.","Poole, Stephen; Townsend, Jennifer; Wertheim, Heiman; Kidd, Stephen P; Welte, Tobias; Schuetz, Philipp; Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Beishuizen, Albertus; Jensen, Jens-Ulrik Stæhr; Del Castillo, Juan González; Plebani, Mario; Saeed, Kordo",Eur. j. clin. microbiol. infect. dis,,646

Does the size of the shadow economy matter?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare services are increasingly confronted with challenges related to old age mental disorders. The survey aimed to provide an overview of existing psychogeriatric services in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, and North Macedonia. METHODS: After identification of psychogeriatric units across the four countries, their head physicians were asked to provide data on their clinical, teaching, and research activity, as well as staff composition. Moreover, the attitudes of head physicians to current needs and future service development were explored. RESULTS: A total of 15 psychogeriatric units were identified (3 in Bulgaria, 8 in Greece, and 4 in North Macedonia). Results show wide variation regarding the location, team size and composition, service availability, numbers of patients attending, and inpatient treatment length. Most head physicians underscored the urgent need for breakthroughs in the graduate and postgraduate education in psychogeriatrics of medical and nonmedical professionals, as well as in the interconnection of their units with community primary healthcare services and long-term care facilities for seniors via telemedicine. They would welcome the development of national standards for psychogeriatric units, potentially embodying clear pointers for action. A number of head physicians advocated the development of nationwide old age mental health registries. CONCLUSIONS: Regional disparities in resources and services for seniors' mental health services were unveiled. These data may enrich the dialogue on optimizing psychogeriatric services through planning future cross-border collaborations mainly based on telemedicine services, especially in the era of the novel coronavirus pandemic, and training/education in psychogeriatrics of mental health professionals.","Alexopoulos, P; Novotni, A; Novotni, G; Vorvolakos, T; Vratsista, A; Konsta, A; Kaprinis, S; Konstantinou, A; Bonotis, K; Katirtzoglou, E; Siarkos, K; Bekri, E S; Kokkoris, I; Como, A; Gournellis, R; Stoyanov, D S; Politis, A",Eur Psychiatry,,646

METHODS: DIA-RAMADAN was a real-world, observational, international, non-comparative study. The global study population was divided into three regional subgroups, with data gathered at inclusion 6-8 weeks prior to Ramadan (V0), during Ramadan (4.5 weeks) and 4-6 weeks after Ramadan (V1). Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients reporting &#8805; 1 symptomatic hypoglycaemic events (HE), which were collected using a patient diary along with other adverse events. RESULTS: Patient numbers from the three regions were n = 564 (46.5%; Indian sub-continent), n = 354 (29.1%; Middle East) and n = 296 (24.4%; South-East Asia). Patient baseline characteristics, demographics, fasting habits and antidiabetic treatments varied between regions. There were similar proportions of symptomatic HE between regions, with no severe HE. Significant weight reductions were observed in all regions following Ramadan, along with reductions in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose. CONCLUSION: These real-world study data indicate that gliclazide MR is safe and effective for management of type 2 diabetes during Ramadan in all three regions studied as part of DIA-RAMADAN.

Com a pesquisa de amostras deste parasito provenientes de outras regiões do mundo, como no caso do Brasil, várias outras configurações genotípicas diferentes das dos arquétipos mencionados acima vêm sendo encontradas. Neste trabalho, quarenta galinhas/galos (Gallus domesticus) de criação livre de oito propriedades rurais de áreas limítrofes ao Pantanal da Nhecolândia no estado do Mato Grosso do Sul foram eutanasiadas e amostras de sangue, cérebro e coração foram coletadas. O sorodiagnóstico foi realizado através do Teste de Aglutinação Modificado (MAT) e, com um pool de órgãos dos animais positivos, foi realizado bioensaio em camundongos. Foram obtidos, após o bioensaio, 11 isolados de T. gondii.

Although at the final analysis the outcome will be determined for all subjects, at an interim analysis, the status of some participants may not yet be determined, e.g., because ascertainment of the outcome may not be possible until some pre-specified follow-up time. Accordingly, the outcome from these subjects can be viewed as censored. A valid interim analysis can be based on data only from those subjects with full follow up; however, this approach is inefficient, as it does not exploit additional information that may be available on those for whom the outcome is not yet available at the time of the interim analysis. Appealing to the theory of semiparametrics, we propose an estimator for the odds ratio in a proportional odds model with censored, time-lagged categorical outcome that incorporates additional baseline and time-dependent covariate information and demonstrate that it can result in considerable gains in efficiency relative to simpler approaches. A byproduct of the approach is a covariate-adjusted estimator for the odds ratio based on the full data that would be available at a final analysis.","Tsiatis, Anastasios A.; Davidian, Marie; Holloway, Shannon T.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15559v3.pdf,646

The overall agreement between the standard and direct methods was 86.8 % (kappa 0.60), and the sensitivity of the direct method compared to the standard method was 85.4 %. When the cycle threshold (Ct) value was less than 35, the sensitivity was approximately 90 %-98 %, and when Ct exceeded 35, it decreased to approximately 60 %-65 %.

The scientific community remains in urgent need of prognostic tools to determine the probability of survival in patients with COVID-19 and to determine the need for hospitalization. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary center between March 2020 and July 2020. Patients age 18 years and older were stratified into two groups based on their troponin-I level in the first 24 h of admission (groups: elevated vs. normal). The aim of the study is to explore the utility of cardiac troponin-I level for early prognostication of patients with COVID-19. Results: This cohort of 257 patients included 122/257 (47%) women with a mean age of 63 ± 17 years. Patients with an elevated troponin-I level were more likely to be older (77 ± 13 vs. 58 ± 16 years, P < 0.0001), have a history of hypertension (P < 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.0019), atrial fibrillation or flutter (P = 0.0009), coronary artery disease (P < 0.0001), and chronic heart failure (P = 0.0011). Patients with an elevated troponin-I level in the first 24 h of admission were more likely to have higher in-hospital mortality (52% vs. 10%, P < 0.0001). Troponin-I level in the first 24 h of admission had a negative predictive value of 89.7% and a positive predictive value of 51.9% for all-cause in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: Troponin-I elevation is commonly seen in patients with COVID-19 and is significantly associated with fatal outcomes. However, a normal troponin-I level in the first 24 h of admission had a high negative predictive value for all-cause in-hospital mortality, thereby predicting favorable survival at the time of discharge.","Al Abbasi, Baher; Torres, Pedro; Ramos-Tuarez, Fergie; Dewaswala, Nakeya; Abdallah, Ahmed; Chen, Kai; Abdul Qader, Mohamed; Job, Riya; Aboulenain, Samar; Dziadkowiec, Karolina; Bhopalwala, Huzefa; Pino, Jesus E; Chait, Robert D",Cardiol Res,,646

The more egregious practices, historically as well as today, include outright denials of access to health care, involuntary sterilization, forced institutionalization, coerced treatment, and substituted decision-making. Discrimination also occurs by more insidious practices. For instance, the public health construct of DALYS (disability adjusted life years) ""neutrally"" devalues the lives of persons with disabilities relative to the lives of those without disabilities. Along the same lines, commonly accepted norms and practices lessen the priority of persons with disabilities for essential procedures, such as organ transplants. Moreover, clinical bias disproportionately affects some disabled people, particularly those who occupy racialized, gendered, and sexually marginalized intersections. Finally, many otherwise laudable programs, such as United Nations HIV/AIDS programming, neglected for decades to include persons with disabilities. This essay considers types of clinical bias against patients with disabilities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, how such stigma impairs their equal access to health care, and how the application of international human rights norms would mitigate such impacts.","Haque, Omar Sultan Stein Michael Ashley",Health and Human Rights,,646

267278,Augmented reality is human-like: How the humanizing experience inspires destination brand love,2021,"Introduction:Although patient-centered care can be found in the mission statement of nearly every hospital, it is not always put into practice, and COVID-19 brings new challenges even to the best-organized hospitals and well-developed health care systems. Methods:In the current COVID-19 pandemic, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients have a potentially higher risk of complications from this infectious disease due to the use of immunosuppressant and/or biologic treatments and due to flares of this chronic illness, which often require urgent care and sometimes hospitalization. Moreover, patients undergoing biologic intravenous (IV) treatment visit the hospital for scheduled IV infusions. Discussion: In hospitals like ours, where COVID-19 patients are treated, the organization of “clean circuits” is essential to minimize the risks of infection for non-COVID-19 patients, such as patients in IBD infusion units. In our hospital, the IBD infusion unit is located within the gastroenterology department, which, under normal circumstances, is very advantageous for patients but in the current context is not. Our goal was to maximize adherence to biologic IV treatment and clinical safety at a time of profound changes in gastroenterology activity and in a department with daily increases in the number of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion:To this end, we initiated proactive COVID-19 testing in IBD patients undergoing biologic IV treatment and changed the location of the infusion unit to a “COVID-free” institution, maintaining the care of these patients by the dedicated IBD team of our department. The purpose of this report is to show that a patient-centered care strategy allowed us to reach very high levels of patient comfort, satisfaction, and compliance with therapeutics.","Lago, Paula Caetano Cidalina Ferreira Daniela Salgado Marta Pedroto Isabel",Portuguese Journal of Gastroenterology,,646

We aimed to use genomic sequencing to understand the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes COVID-19 - in the region. We analyzed 620 samples collected from the Johns Hopkins Health System during March 11-31, 2020, comprising 28.6% of the total cases in Maryland and Washington, DC. From these samples, we generated 114 complete viral genomes. Analysis of these genomes alongside a subsampling of over 1000 previously published sequences showed that the diversity in this region rivaled global SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity at that time and that the sequences belong to all of the major globally circulating lineages, suggesting multiple introductions into the region. We also analyzed these regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes alongside detailed clinical metadata and found that clinically severe cases had viral genomes belonging to all major viral lineages. We conclude that efforts to control local spread of the virus were likely confounded by the number of introductions into the region early in the epidemic and the interconnectedness of the region as a whole.","Thielen, Peter M; Wohl, Shirlee; Mehoke, Thomas; Ramakrishnan, Srividya; Kirsche, Melanie; Falade-Nwulia, Oluwaseun; Trovão, Nídia S; Ernlund, Amanda; Howser, Craig; Sadowski, Norah; Morris, C Paul; Hopkins, Mark; Schwartz, Matthew; Fan, Yunfan; Gniazdowski, Victoria; Lessler, Justin; Sauer, Lauren; Schatz, Michael C; Evans, Jared D; Ray, Stuart C; Timp, Winston; Mostafa, Heba H",JCI insight,,646

Commonalities included the pushing need due to the emergency, previous experiences, and a dynamic research and innovation environment. Lights included feasibility, results, reduction of isolation, cost decrease, stimulation to innovation, satisfaction of patients, families, and professionals beyond the starting diffidence. Shadows included that telemedicine can integrate but will never substitute face-to-face rehabilitation base on the encounter among human beings; age, and technology barriers (devices absence, bad connection and human diffidence) have also been reported. Possible issues included privacy and informed consent, payments, cultural difficulties in understanding that telemedicine is a real rehabilitation intervention. There was a final agreement that this experience will be incorporated by participants in their future services: technology is ready, but the real challenge is to change PRM physicians' and patients' habits, while better specific regulation is warranted.","Negrini, Stefano; Kiekens, Carlotte; Bernetti, Andrea; Capecci, Marianna; Ceravolo, Maria G; Lavezzi, Susanna; Zampolini, Mauro; Boldrini, Paolo",Eur J Phys Rehabil Med,,646

Unconventional Thoughts in Unconventional Times,2021,"Although T cells are likely players in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunity, little is known about the phenotypic features of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells associated with recovery from severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We analyze T cells from 34 individuals with COVID-19 with severity ranging from mild (outpatient) to critical, culminating in death. Relative to individuals who succumbed, individuals who recovered from severe COVID-19 harbor elevated and increasing numbers of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells capable of homeostatic proliferation. In contrast, fatal COVID-19 cases display elevated numbers of SARS-CoV-2-specific regulatory T cells and a time-dependent escalation in activated bystander CXCR4+ T cells, as assessed by longitudinal sampling. Together with the demonstration of increased proportions of inflammatory CXCR4+ T cells in the lungs of individuals with severe COVID-19, these results support a model where lung-homing T cells activated through bystander effects contribute to immunopathology, whereas a robust, non-suppressive SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response limits pathogenesis and promotes recovery from severe COVID-19.","Neidleman, Jason; Luo, Xiaoyu; George, Ashley F; McGregor, Matthew; Yang, Junkai; Yun, Cassandra; Murray, Victoria; Gill, Gurjot; Greene, Warner C; Vasquez, Joshua; Lee, Sulggi A; Ghosn, Eliver; Lynch, Kara L; Roan, Nadia R",Cell Rep,,646
273460,Behavioral Intention of e-Learning: A Case Study of Distance Learning at a Junior High School in Indonesia due to the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has led surgical societies to recommend delaying diagnosis and treatment of suspected lung cancer in lesions <2 cm. Delaying diagnosis can lead to disease progression, but the impact of this delay on mortality is unknown. The COVID-19 infection rate at which immediate operative risk exceeds benefit is unknown. We sought to model immediate versus delayed surgical resection in a suspicious lung nodule <2 cm. METHODS: A decision analysis model was developed, and sensitivity analyses performed. The base case was a 65-year-old male smoker with COPD presenting for surgical biopsy of 1.5-2.0 cm lung nodule highly suspicious for cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared immediate surgical resection to delayed resection after three months. The likelihood of key outcomes was derived from the literature where available. The outcome was 5-year overall survival. RESULTS: Immediate surgical resection resulted in a similar but slightly higher 5-year overall survival when compared to delayed resection (0.77 versus 0.74), due to the risk of disease progression. However, if the probability of acquired COVID-19 infection is greater than 13%, delayed resection is favorable (0.74 vs 0.73). CONCLUSIONS: Immediate surgical biopsy of lung nodules suspicious for cancer in hospitals with low COVID-19 prevalence likely results in improved 5-year survival. However, as the risk of perioperative COVID-19 infection increases above 13%, a delayed approach has similar or improved survival. This balance should be frequently re-examined at each healthcare facility throughout the curve of the pandemic.","Shipe, Maren E; Haddad, Diane N; Deppen, Stephen A; Kozower, Benjamin D; Grogan, Eric L",Ann. thorac. surg,,646

273930,International Students' Perceptions of Virtual Service Learning Program amidst COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is considered a major target for the discovery of direct antiviral agents. We previously reported the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors in a novel self-assembled monolayer desorption ionization mass spectrometry (SAMDI-MS) enzymatic assay (Gurard-Levin et al., 2020). The assay was further improved by adding the rhinovirus HRV3C protease to the same well as the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro enzyme. High substrate specificity for each enzyme allowed the proteases to be combined in a single assay reaction without interfering with their individual activities. This novel duplex assay was used to profile a diverse set of reference protease inhibitors. The protease inhibitors were grouped into three categories based on their relative potency against 3CLpro and HRV3C including those that are: equipotent against 3CLpro and HRV3C (GC376 and calpain inhibitor II), selective for 3CLpro (PF-00835231, calpain inhibitor XII, boceprevir), and selective for HRV3C (rupintrivir). Structural analysis showed that the combination of minimal interactions, conformational flexibility, and limited bulk allows GC376 and calpain inhibitor II to potently inhibit both enzymes. In contrast, bulkier compounds interacting more tightly with pockets P2, P3, and P4 due to optimization for a specific target display a more selective inhibition profile. Consistently, the most selective viral protease inhibitors were relatively weak inhibitors of human cathepsin L. Taken together, these results can guide the design of cysteine protease inhibitors that are either virus-specific or retain a broad antiviral spectrum against coronaviruses and rhinoviruses.","Liu, Cheng; Boland, Sandro; Scholle, Michael D; Bardiot, Dorothee; Marchand, Arnaud; Chaltin, Patrick; Blatt, Lawrence M; Beigelman, Leonid; Symons, Julian A; Raboisson, Pierre; Gurard-Levin, Zachary A; Vandyck, Koen; Deval, Jerome",Antiviral Res,,646

Statistical significance of difference at two time points was done to determine how restrictive epidemiological measures and exposure of children to COVID-19 infection affect this prevalence in different age groups. Materials and methods: At the first time point (13th to 29th May 2020), 240 samples and in second time point (24th October to 23rd November 2020), 308 serum samples were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Confirmation of results and titre determination was done using virus micro-neutralization test. Subjects were divided according to gender, age and epidemiological history. Results: Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies differs significantly in two time points (P = 0.010). In first time point 2.9% of seropositive children were determined and in second time point 8.4%. Statistically significant difference (P = 0.007) of seroprevalence between two time points was found only in a group of children aged 11-19 years. At the first time point, all seropositive children were asymptomatic with titre &lt; 8. At the second time point, 69.2% seropositive children were asymptomatic with titre &gt;= 8. Conclusions: The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was significantly lower at the first time point than at the second time point. Values of virus micro-neutralization test showed that low titre in asymptomatic children was not protective at the first time point but in second time point all seropositive children had protective titre of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Lenicek Krleza, J.; Zrinski Topic, R.; Stevanovic, V.; Lukic-Grlic, A.; Tabain, I.; Misak, Z.; Roic, G.; Kaic, B.; Mayer, D.; Hruskar, Z.; Barbic, L.; Vilibic-Cavlek, T.",Biochemia Medica,,646

274634,Pressure from the Pandemic: Pedagogical Dissatisfaction Reveals Faculty Beliefs,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread around the world and has increased the public's need for health information in the process. Meanwhile, in the context of lockdowns and other measures for preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread, the internet has surged as a web-based resource for health information. Under these conditions, social question-and-answer communities (SQACs) are playing an increasingly important role in improving public health literacy. There is great theoretical and practical significance in exploring the influencing factors of SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish an extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model that could analyze the influence factors of SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information. Particularly, we tried to test the moderating effects that different demographic characteristics had on the variables' influences. METHODS: This study was conducted by administering a web-based questionnaire survey and analyzing the responses from a final total of 598 valid questionnaires after invalid data were cleaned. By using structural equation modelling, the influencing factors of SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information were analyzed. The moderating effects of variables were verified via hierarchical regression. RESULTS: Performance expectation (ß=.282; P<.001), social influence (ß=.238; P=.02), and facilitating conditions (ß=.279; P=.002) positively affected users' willingness to adopt health information, whereas effort expectancy (P=.79) and perceived risk (P=.41) had no significant effects. Gender had a significant moderating effect in the structural equation model (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information was evidently affected by multiple factors, such as performance expectation, social influence, and facilitating conditions. The structural equation model proposed in this study has a good fitting degree and good explanatory power for users' willingness to adopt health information. Suggestions were provided for SQAC operators and health management agencies based on our research results.","Li, PengFei; Xu, Lin; Tang, Tingting; Wu, Xiaoqian; Huang, Cheng",J Med Internet Res,,646

In this study, we aimed to explore the targeting performance of 99mTc-PHC-102 in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with RCC, while also assessing the safety and tolerability of the radiotracer. Methods: We studied five patients with localized or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) in a microdosing regimen, after the administration of 100 µg total CAIX ligand and 600-800 MBq 99mTc-PHC-102. Tissue distribution and residence time in normal organs and tumors were analysed by serial SPECT/CT scans at three time points (30 minutes, 2, and 6 hours) after intravenous administration. Results: In the five patients studied, 99mTc-PHC-102 was well tolerated and no study drug-related adverse events were recorded. The radiotracer showed a rapid initial uptake in the stomach, kidneys and gallbladder, which cleared over time. Localization of the study drug in primary tumors of five patients was observed with favourable tumour-to-background ratios. 99mTc-PHC-102-SPECT/CT allowed the identification of four previously unknown lung and lymph node metastases in two patients. Conclusion: 99mTc-PHC-102 is a promising SPECT tracer for the imaging of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. This tracer has the potential to identify primary and metastatic lesions in different anatomical locations. 99mTc-PHC-102 might also serve as companion diagnostic agent for future CAIX-targeting therapeutics.","Kulterer, Oana Cristina; Pfaff, Sarah; Wadsak, Wolfgang; Garstka, Nathalie; Remzi, Mesut; Vraka, Chrysoula; Nics, Lukas; Bootz, Franziska; Cazzamalli, Samuele; Krall, Nikolaus; Neri, Dario; Haug, Alexander Robert",J. nucl. med,,646

Historically, imaging information in early detection schema was assessed qualitatively. However, the last decade has seen increased development of computerized tools that convert images into quantitative mineable data (radiomics), and their subsequent analyses with artificial intelligence, AI. These tools are improving diagnostic accuracy of early lesions to define risk and classify malignant/aggressive from benign/indolent disease. The first section of this review will briefly describe the various imaging modalities and their use as primary or secondary screens in an early detection pipeline. The second section will describe specific use cases to illustrate the breadth of imaging modalities as well as the benefits of quantitative image analytics. These will include optical (skin cancer), X-ray CT (pancreatic and lung cancer), X-ray mammography (breast cancer), multiparametric MRI (breast and prostate cancer), PET (pancreatic cancer), and ultrasound elastography (liver cancer). Finally, we will discuss the inexorable improvements in radiomics to build more robust classifier models, and the significant limitations to this development that include access will well annotated data bases, and biological descriptors of the imaged feature data.","Gillies, Robert J; Schabath, Matthew B",Cancer epidemiol. biomark. prev,,646

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) present additional challenges given their superimposed risk for severe infections and amputations. The main objectives were to develop a triage algorithm to effectively risk-stratify all DFUs for potential complications, complying with social distancing regulations, preserving personal protective equipment, and to assess feasibility of virtual care for DFU. METHODS: Longitudinal study during the COVID-19 pandemic performed at a large tertiary institution evaluating the effectiveness of a targeted triage protocol developed using a combined approach of virtual care, electronic medical record data mining, and tracing for rapid risk stratification to derive optimal care delivery methods. 2868 patients with diabetes at risk for foot complications within last 12â¯months were included and rates of encounters, hospitalizations, and minor amputations were compared to one year prior. RESULTS: The STRIDE protocol was implemented in 1-week and eventually included 2600 patients (90.7%) demonstrating effective triage. During normal operations, 40% (938 of 2345) of all visits were due to DFUs and none were performed virtually. After implementation, 98% face-to-face visits were due to DFU, and virtual visits increased by 21,900%. This risk stratified approach led to similar low rates of DFU-related-hospitalization and minor amputation rates 20% versus 24% (pâ¯>â¯0.05) during and prior the pandemic, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of STRIDE protocol was effective to risk-stratify and triage all patients with diabetic foot complications preventing increase in hospitalization and amputations while promoting both social and physical distancing.","Schmidt, Brian M; Munson, Michael E; Rothenberg, Gary M; Holmes, Crystal M; Pop-Busui, Rodica",J Diabetes Complications,,646
277921,Design and Validation of a Questionnaire on Influence of the University Classroom on Motivation and Sociability,2021,"BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases (ID) physicians perform a pivotal role in directing the response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). AIM: To assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on workload and the perceptions of ID physicians regarding the national response in Australia and New Zealand in the pre-pandemic. METHODS: A survey of ID physicians in Australia and New Zealand was undertaken from 3 to 10 March 2020. Respondents were asked to estimate time spent on SARS-CoV-2-related activities in February and report their agreement with statements on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 'strongly agree' to 'strongly disagree'. We also asked about the intended use of investigational agents. RESULTS: There were 214 respondents (36% of 600 eligible participants). The median workload due to SARS-CoV-2-related activities was 34% of one full-time equivalent (interquartile range 18-68%). Less than a quarter (50, 23%) of respondents had experience managing cases, while 33% (70) had experience preparing during similar pandemics. Nevertheless, 88% (188/213) believed they were well informed when giving testing and management advice, and 45% (95/212) believed their national response was well coordinated. Additionally, 41% (88/214) were worried about becoming infected through occupational exposure. Over half (116, 54%) the respondents intended to use lopinavir/ritonavir in confirmed cases of COVID-19 with severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: ID physicians spent a large proportion of time on SARS-CoV-2-related activities. Increased staffing is required to avoid burnout. Importantly, ID physicians feel well informed when giving advice. A national body should be established to co-ordinate response.

280507,Assessment and Improvement of Anti-COVID-19 Measures in Higher Education Establishments,2021,"Breast cancer (BC) is currently the most common malignant tumor of women in the world. At present, the development of BC is accelerating and showing a younger trend, which may be due to the known and/or unknown risk factors (RFs) for BC are increasing. It has been reported that inflammatory factors promote the occurrence and development of BC. No doubt chronic inflammation could trigger a series of molecular events, which will lead to the malignant transformation of differentiated cells, inhibition of anti-tumor immunity, and finally, lead to the occurrence and metastasis of tumors. With the deepening of research, it has been found that pro-inflammatory cytokine-interleukin-17 (IL-17) is closely related to BC. It not only plays an important role in promoting tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis, but also has a significant correlation with poor prognosis. Recently, it was reported that IL-17 is closely related to programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in BC. Therefore, starting with the role of IL-17 family cytokines in BC, this paper briefly discusses the potential role and status of IL-17 and seeks to contribute to the development of targeted drugs for BC-related treatments and to the identification of prediction factors for the early detection and prognosis prediction of BC for laying a solid theoretical foundation.","Song, Xuelian; Wei, Changran; Li, Xiangqi",Int Immunopharmacol,,646

Due to the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia, novel chest X-ray (CXR) images that can be used for deep learning analysis are very rare. To solve this problem, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates a convolutional neural network and a capsule network. DenseCapsNet, a new deep learning framework, is formed by the fusion of a dense convolutional network (DenseNet) and the capsule neural network (CapsNet), leveraging their respective advantages and reducing the dependence of convolutional neural networks on a large amount of data. Using 750 CXR images of lungs of healthy patients as well as those of patients with other pneumonia and novel coronavirus pneumonia, the method can obtain an accuracy of 90.7% and an F1 score of 90.9%, and the sensitivity for detecting COVID-19 can reach 96%. These results show that the deep fusion neural network DenseCapsNet has good performance in novel coronavirus pneumonia CXR radiography detection.","Quan, Hao; Xu, Xiaosong; Zheng, Tingting; Li, Zhi; Zhao, Mingfang; Cui, Xiaoyu",Comput Biol Med,,646
282249,A Pandemic Crash Course: Learning to Teach Equitably in Synchronous Online Classes,2020,"(1) Background: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak. Systemic ozone therapy (OT) could be potentially useful in the clinical management of several complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2. The rationale and mechanism of action has already been proven clinically in other viral infections and has been shown in research studies to be highly effective at decreasing organ damage mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress. This review summarizes the OT studies that illustrate the possible cytoprotective mechanism of action of ozone and its physiological by-products in target organs affected by SARS-CoV-2. (2) Methods: This review encompasses a total of 74 peer-reviewed original articles. It is mainly focused on ozone as a modulator of the NF-&#954; B/Nrf2 pathways and IL-6/IL-1ß expression. (3) Results: In experimental models and the few existent clinical studies, homeostasis of the free radical and antioxidant balance by OT was associated with a modulation of NF-&#954; B/Nrf2 balance and IL-6 and IL-1ß expression. These molecular mechanisms support the cytoprotective effects of OT against tissue damage present in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. (4) Conclusions: The potential cytoprotective role of OT in the management of organ damage induced by COVID-19 merits further research. Controlled clinical trials are needed.","Martínez-Sánchez, Gregorio; Schwartz, Adriana; Donna, Vincenzo Di",,,646
282377,"Civil justice in Bolivia, the naked truth of COVID-19",2020,"During February 2021, an opening event was held indoors at a rural Illinois bar that accommodates approximately 100 persons. The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and local health department staff members investigated a COVID-19 outbreak associated with this opening event. Overall, 46 COVID-19 cases were linked to the event, including cases in 26 patrons and three staff members who attended the opening event and 17 secondary cases. Four persons with cases had COVID-19-like symptoms on the same day they attended the event. Secondary cases included 12 cases in eight households with children, two on a school sports team, and three in a long-term care facility (LTCF). Transmission associated with the opening event resulted in one school closure affecting 650 children (9,100 lost person-days of school) and hospitalization of one LTCF resident with COVID-19. These findings demonstrate that opening up settings such as bars, where mask wearing and physical distancing are challenging, can increase the risk for community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. As community businesses begin to reopen, a multicomponent approach should be emphasized in settings such as bars to prevent transmission* (1). This includes enforcing consistent and correct mask use, maintaining &#8805;6 ft of physical distance between persons, reducing indoor bar occupancy, prioritizing outdoor seating, improving building ventilation, and promoting behaviors such as staying at home when ill, as well as implementing contact tracing in combination with isolation and quarantine when COVID-19 cases are diagnosed.","Sami, Samira; Turbyfill, Caitlin R; Daniel-Wayman, Shelby; Shonkwiler, Stacy; Fisher, Kiva A; Kuhring, Macey; Patrick, Aaron M; Hinton, Stephanie; Minor, Amanda S; Ricaldi, Jessica N; Ezike, Ngozi; Kauerauf, Judy; Duffus, Wayne A",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,646

However, there is scarce evidence of such technological interventions' effectiveness, and there are no standardized methods to evaluate the short- and long-term impact of such technologies on people's physical activity and health. This work aims to help ST and HCI practitioners and researchers by empowering them with systematic guidelines and an extensible framework for constructing such technological interventions. This survey and the proposed design and evaluation framework aim to contribute to health behavior change and user engagement sustainability. To this end, we conduct a literature review of 117 papers between 2008 and 2020, which identifies the core ST HCI design methods and their efficacy, as well as and the most comprehensive list to date of user engagement evaluation metrics for ST. Based on the review's findings, we propose the PAST SELF end-to-end framework to facilitate the classification, design, and evaluation of ST technology. PAST SELF systematically organizes common methods and guidelines from existing works in ubiquitous ST research. Hence, it has potential applications in industrial and scientific settings and can be utilized by practitioners and researchers alike.","Yfantidou, Sofia; Sermpezis, Pavlos; Vakali, Athena",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11483v1.pdf,646

RESULTS: Of 557 consecutive COVID-19 patients, 46 had active cancer (8%). Comorbidities included diabetes (n = 137, 25%), hypertension (n = 284, 51%), coronary artery disease (n = 114, 20%) and dyslipidaemia (n = 122, 22%). Oncologic patients were older (mean age 71 vs 65, p = 0.012), more often smokers (20% vs 8%, p = 0.009), with higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (13.3 vs 8.2, p = 0.046).

Some of these impacts are associated with longer-term energy demand changes and some could just be temporary. The study intends to present the results of a small pilot study conducted in China, by addressing household energy use. The samples are from 352 households and particularly focus on primary energy use in three periods of pre-pandemic (and pre-lockdown), start of COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, and post lockdown. Each period is identified as a timeframe of 2.5 months, from November 2019 to late June 2020. The samples of this study highlight the primary implications of energy use, some that are understood as interim changes and some that may appear to be more prolonged. The results from the study highlight a variety of impacts on household energy use as well as prolonged impacts on transportation use. The primary household energy use are assessed in six fundamental elements of (1) transportation for commuting and leisure (for both private and public modes), (2) cooking, (3) entertainment, (4) heating and cooling, (5) lighting, and (6) the others. The results are summarized in three sections focused on major impacts on transportation use (comparison between private and public modes), cooking and entertainment, heating/cooling and lighting. The results could provide early suggestions for cities/regions that are experiencing longer lockdown.

METHODS: Influenza VE in children was estimated in the first influenza season (2019/20) overlapping with the COVID-19 epidemic by conducting a single-center, test-negative case-control (TNCC) study. Effects of prior influenza infection and vaccination in children were assessed for the 2019-2020 season. RESULTS: Among 386 children, the adjusted VE was significant for influenza A/H1N1 (45.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-69.7) and influenza B (66.7%; 95% CI: 35.9-82.7). Among patients aged 0-6 years, the adjusted VE was significant for influenza A (total: A/H1N1+A/H3N2) (65.0%; 95% CI: 22.2-84.3), influenza A/H1N1 (64.8%; 95% CI: 16.9-85.1), and influenza B (87.4%; 95% CI: 50.5-96.8). No VE was observed in patients aged 7-15 years. Two vaccine doses tended to decrease the incidences of influenza A (total) and influenza A/H1N1 in patients aged 0-6 years. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of influenza B infection in patients, who had influenza during the previous season, were significantly low among all participants (0.29; 95% CI: 0.11-0.78) and patients aged 7-15 years (0.34; 95% CI: 0.12-0.94). The adjusted ORs of influenza infections were not significant in patients vaccinated during the previous season.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 15 April and 14 May 2020, a multicentre cross-sectional survey was performed to study depression, anxiety and resilience in a sample of Spanish pregnant women during the lockdown set up by the Government in response to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. We designed an anonymous online self-administered questionnaire (https://bit.ly/34RRpq1) that included the Spanish validated versions of the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Connor-Davidson Resilience 10-items Scale (CD-RISC-10). RESULTS: A total of 514 pregnant women completed the survey. 72.8% had been confined < 40 days and 27.2% between 41 and 60 days. 182 (35.4%) participants scored over 10, with 21.3% scoring over 13 (75th Percentile) in depressive symptoms rates. We found high trait and anxiety scores, with 223 (43.4%) and 227 (44.2%) pregnant women scoring over the trait and state mean scores. Neither depression, anxiety or resilience levels showed any significant correlation with the length of confinement. We found low CD-RISC-10 scores. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms during the quarantine, although we did not find an increased prevalence of psychological distress according to length of home confinement. Resilience correlated negatively with depression and anxiety.","Lubián López, Daniel María; Butrón Hinojo, Carmen Aisha; Arjona Bernal, Jose Eduardo; Fasero Laiz, María; Alcolea Santiago, José; Guerra Vilches, Virginia; Casaus Fernández, Marta; Bueno Moral, Ana; Olvera Perdigones, Antonio; Rodríguez Rodríguez, Begoña; Cuevas Palomino, Andrés; Presa Lorite, Jesús; Coronado Martín, Pluvio; Sánchez-Prieto, Manuel; Sánchez-Borrego, Rafael; González-Mesa, Ernesto",J Psychosom Obstet Gynaecol,,646

Out of 10333 spike protein sequences analyzed, 8155 proteins comprised one or more mutations. A total of 9654 mutations were observed that correspond to 400 distinct mutation sites. The receptor binding domain (RBD) which is involved in the interactions with human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor and causes infection leading to the COVID-19 disease comprised 44 mutations that included residues within 3.2 Å interacting distance from the ACE-2 receptor. The mutations observed in the spike proteins are discussed in the context of their distribution according to the geographical locations, mutation sites, mutation types, distribution of the number of mutations at the mutation sites and mutations at the glycosylation sites. The density of mutations in different regions of the spike protein sequence and location of the mutations in protein three-dimensional structure corresponding to the RBD are discussed. The mutations identified in the present work are important considerations for antibody, vaccine, and drug development.","Guruprasad, Lalitha",Proteins,,646
293078,"Spies, viruses and vaporetti: how the pandemic increases distances in the Venice lagoon",2021,"Background: Change is an ongoing process in any organizations. Over years, healthcare organizations have been exposed to multiple external stimuli to change (eg, ageing population, increasing incidence of chronic diseases, ongoing Sars-Cov-2 pandemic) that pointed out the need to convert the current healthcare organizational model. Nowadays, the topic is extremely relevant, rendering organizational change an urgency. The work is structured on a double level of analysis. In the beginning, the paper collects the overall literature on the topic of organisational change in order to identify, on the basis of the citation network, the main existing theoretical approaches. Secondly, the analysis attempts to isolate the scientific production related to the healthcare context, by analysing the body of literature outside the identified citation network, divided by clusters of related studies. Methodology: This review adopted a quantitative-based method that employs jointly systematic literature review and bibliographic network analysis. Specifically, the study applied a citation network analysis (CNA) and a co-occurrence keywords analysis. The CNA allowed detecting the most relevant papers published over time, identifying the research streams in literature. Results: The study showed four main findings. Firstly, consistent with past studies, works reviewed pointed out a convergence on the micro-level perspective for change's analysis. Secondly, an organic viewpoint whereby individual, organization and change's outcome contribute to any organizational change's action has been found in its early stage. Thirdly, works reported change combined with innovation's concept, although the structure of the relationship has not been outlined. Fourth, interestingly, contributions have been limited within the healthcare context. Conclusion: Human dimension is the primary criticality to be managed to impede failure of the re-organizational path. Individuals are not passive recipients of change: individual change acceptance has been found a key input. Few papers discussed healthcare professionals' behaviour, and those available focused on technology-led changes perspective. In this view, individual acceptance of change within the healthcare context resulted being undeveloped and offers rooms for further analyses.","Milella, F.; Minelli, E.

294578,The Impact of Covid-19 on Tourism Sustainability: Evidence from Portugal,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of a prevention strategy against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection among dental hospital staff over a 3-month period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effectiveness of the prevention strategy, which adopted healthcare staff protective measures, including patient triage and correct usage of personal preventive equipment, was evaluated by SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing. Patients who visited the Affiliated Stomatology Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China, between January 31 and March 1 (lockdown period) and March 2 and April 27 (reopening period) in 2020 and in the same period in 2019 were included in the study. Patients' diagnosis, age, gender, and several undergoing aerosol-generating procedures during the study period were collected from the hospital's database. Corresponding data were compared year-on-year (2020-on-2019). A total of 757 hospital staff underwent SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing on April 28-29, 2020. RESULTS: During the lockdown and reopening period in 2020, the number of hospital visits was dramatically decreased to about 6% and 58%, respectively, compared with the same period in 2019. However, emergency visits were increased 16- and 6.4-fold. A total of at least 6654 patients (13.58%) underwent aerosol-generating procedures during the study period in the year 2020. All hospital staff were negative according to SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing (IgG, IgM) data. CONCLUSION: During the study period in 2020, the total number of hospital visits dramatically reduced but emergency visits significantly increased. The prevention strategy implemented successfully prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection spread among healthcare workers in a dental hospital. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The prevention strategy indicated patient triage and how to adopt preventive measures for controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread among healthcare workers. These data can be used as a reference for other sectors suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhang, Ling; Xu, Yuedan; Jin, Xinyang; Shi, Zhiwei; Wu, Mengting; Xu, Ning; Yu, Xuefen; Deng, Shuli; Zhang, Kai; Zhang, Liefen; Hannig, Matthias; Chen, Qianming; Fu, Baiping",Clin. oral investig,,646
294754,Inside NYSE's response to the Covid-19 crisis,2020,"Despite the growing knowledge on the (epi)genetic background of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), the substantial variability in disease severity that exists between FSHD patients is not fully understood. We hypothesized that smoking and alcohol consumption are disease modifiers in FSHD and contribute to the variability in disease severity, because they are both associated with higher levels of oxidative stress in muscle tissue. Oxidative stress is known to influence FSHD muscle tissue. One hundred and ninety-eight genetically confirmed FSHD patients completed a questionnaire from which the number of packyears of smoking and the lifetime cumulative alcohol units consumed were calculated. Disease severity was determined by the FSDH evaluation score. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that both the number of packyears and the amount of alcohol consumption did not influence disease severity (respectively Bâ¯=â¯0.025, &#916;R2=0.006, pâ¯=â¯0.231; and Bâ¯=â¯0.000, &#916;R2=0.004, pâ¯=â¯0.406). Although smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are unhealthy habits which should be discouraged, these results show that smoking and alcohol consumption have no clinically meaningful modifying effect on disease severity in FSHD patients. However, prospective data should show whether alcohol consumption and smoking influence disease progression rate.","Vincenten, Sanne C C; Mul, Karlien; Schreuder, Tim H A; Voermans, Nicol C; Horlings, Corinne G C; van Engelen, Baziel G M",Neuromuscul. disord,,646

Herein, we performed phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), tissue and immune-cell specific expression/splicing quantitative trait loci (eQTL/sQTL), and colocalization analyses for genetic risk loci suggestively associated with severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure. Thirteen phenotypes/traits were associated with the severe COVID-19-associated loci at the genome-wide significance threshold, including monocyte counts, fat metabolism traits, and fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. In addition, we identified tissue and immune subtype-specific eQTL associations affecting 48 genes, including several that may directly impact host immune responses, colocalized with the severe COVID-19 GWAS associations, and showed altered expression in single-cell transcriptomes. Collectively, our work demonstrates that host genetic variations associated with multiple genes and traits show genetic pleiotropy with severe COVID-19 and may inform disease etiology.","Moon, Chang; Schilder, Brian M; Raj, Towfique; Huang, Kuan-Lin",iScience,,646

METHODS: A modified version of the validated Telemedicine Satisfaction and Usefulness Questionnaire was completed by 816 individuals using crowd-sourcing methods. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to determine population characteristics associated with perceived difficulty using telehealth technology. RESULTS: Most respondents (85%) believed that telehealth visits would be a convenient form of healthcare delivery, and 64% would prefer them over in-person office visits. The majority (92%) agreed that telehealth would save them time, but 81% had concerns regarding the lack of physical contact during a musculoskeletal examination. More respondents would feel comfortable using telehealth for routine follow-up care (81%) compared to initial assessment visits (59%) and first postoperative appointments (60%). Roughly 1 in 15 (7%) expressed difficulty with using telehealth; these respondents were more often unmarried, lower-income, and more medically infirm, and reported greater symptoms of depression. After multivariable adjustment, lower income and poor health were retained as predictors of difficulty with navigating telehealth technology (pâ¯=â¯0.027,pâ¯=â¯0.036, respectively). CONCLUSION: The majority of the public appears receptive to telehealth for orthopaedic care for both new patient visits and follow-up appointments. The finding that people with multiple chronic conditions and psychosocial needs struggle to engage with telehealth suggests that those who arguably stand to benefit the most from continued care are the ones being unintentionally left out of this digitization boom.","Puzzitiello, Richard N; Moverman, Michael A; Pagani, Nicholas R; Ryan, Scott P; Salzler, Matthew J; Jawa, Andrew; Menendez, Mariano E",J. natl. med. assoc,,646

We aimed to investigate trends of cardiac disease admissions during the outbreak of the pandemic and possible associations with the applied restrictive measures. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective observational study. METHODS: Data for 4970 patients admitted via the cardiology emergency department (ED) across 3 large-volume urban hospitals in Athens and 2 regional/rural hospitals from February 3, 2020, up to April 12 were recorded. Data from the equivalent (for the COVID-19 outbreak) time period of 2019 and from the postlockdown time period were also collected. RESULTS: A falling trend of cardiology ED visits and hospital admissions was observed starting from the week when the restrictive measures due to COVID-19 were implemented. Compared with the pre-COVID-19 outbreak time period, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [145 (29/week) vs. 60 (12/week), -59%, P < 0.001], ST elevation myocardial infarction [46 (9.2/week) vs. 21 (4.2/week), -54%, P = 0.002], and non-ST elevation ACS [99 cases (19.8/week) vs. 39 (7.8/week), -60% P < 0.001] were reduced at the COVID-19 outbreak time period. Reductions were also noted for heart failure worsening and arrhythmias. The ED visits in the postlockdown period were significantly higher than in the COVID-19 outbreak time period (1511 vs 660; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our data show significant drops in cardiology visits and admissions during the COVID-19 outbreak time period.

301476,Mediated Arabic Language Learning For Higher Education In COVID-19 Situation,2020,"BACKGROUND: Prominent clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include CNS manifestations. However, it is unclear whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, gains access to the CNS and whether it causes neuropathological changes. We investigated the brain tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 for glial responses, inflammatory changes, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS. METHODS: In this post-mortem case series, we investigated the neuropathological features in the brains of patients who died between March 13 and April 24, 2020, in Hamburg, Germany. Inclusion criteria comprised a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and availability of adequate samples. We did a neuropathological workup including histological staining and immunohistochemical staining for activated astrocytes, activated microglia, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the olfactory bulb, basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum. Additionally, we investigated the presence and localisation of SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR and by immunohistochemistry in selected patients and brain regions. FINDINGS: 43 patients were included in our study. Patients died in hospitals, nursing homes, or at home, and were aged between 51 years and 94 years (median 76 years [IQR 70-86]). We detected fresh territorial ischaemic lesions in six (14%) patients. 37 (86%) patients had astrogliosis in all assessed regions. Activation of microglia and infiltration by cytotoxic T lymphocytes was most pronounced in the brainstem and cerebellum, and meningeal cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration was seen in 34 (79%) patients. SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in the brains of 21 (53%) of 40 examined patients, with SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins found in cranial nerves originating from the lower brainstem and in isolated cells of the brainstem. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS was not associated with the severity of neuropathological changes. INTERPRETATION: In general, neuropathological changes in patients with COVID-19 seem to be mild, with pronounced neuroinflammatory changes in the brainstem being the most common finding. There was no evidence for CNS damage directly caused by SARS-CoV-2. The generalisability of these findings needs to be validated in future studies as the number of cases and availability of clinical data were low and no age-matched and sex-matched controls were included.

The visibly significant market capitalization of cryptos also motivates modern financial instruments such as futures and options. Those will depend on the dynamics, volatility, or even the jumps of cryptos. We provide a comprehensive investigation of the risk dynamics of the Bitcoin Market from a realized volatility perspective. The Bitcoin market is extremely risky in the sense of volatility, entangled jumps, and extensive consecutive jumps, which reflect the major incidents worldwide. Empirical study shows that the lagged realized variance increases the future realized variance, while the jumps, especially positive ones, significantly reduce future realized variance.

303029,COVID-19 virus outbreak lockdown: What impacts on household food wastage?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Relaxation practices might be helpful exercises for coping with anxiety and stressful sensations. They may be of particular utility when used in web-based interventions during periods of social isolation. OBJECTIVE: This randomized study aimed to test whether web-based relaxation practices like natural sounds, deep respiration, and body scans can promote relaxation and a positive emotional state, and reduce psychomotor activation and preoccupation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions. Each condition was characterized by a single online session of a guided square breathing exercise, a guided body scan exercise, or natural sounds. The participants listened to one of the fully automated audio clips for 7 minutes and pre-post completed self-assessed scales on perceived relaxation, psychomotor activation, level of preoccupation associated with COVID-19, and emotional state. At the end of the session, qualitative reports on subjective experience were also collected. RESULTS: Overall, 294 participants completed 75% of the survey and 240 completed the entire survey as well as one of three randomly assigned interventions. Perceived relaxation, psychomotor activation/stress, and preoccupation related to COVID-19 showed a positive improvement after participants listened to the audio clips. The same pattern was observed for the valence and perceived dominance of the emotional state. The square breathing and body scan exercises yielded superior results compared to natural sounds in lowering perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a novel insight that can guide the development of future low-cost web-based interventions to reduce preoccupation and stress in the general population.

303853,"The Relationship Between the Chinese Stock Market, the US Stock Market, and Some Other Economic Indexes Under the COVID-19 Pandemic",2021,"In recent months, a novel virus named Coronavirus has emerged to become a pandemic. The virus is spreading not only humans, but it is also affecting animals. First ever case of Coronavirus was registered in city of Wuhan, Hubei province of China on 31st of December in 2019. Coronavirus infected patients display very similar symptoms like pneumonia, and it attacks the respiratory organs of the body, causing difficulty in breathing. The disease is diagnosed using a Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit and requires time in the laboratory to confirm the presence of the virus. Due to insufficient availability of the kits, the suspected patients cannot be treated in time, which in turn increases the chance of spreading the disease. To overcome this solution, radiologists observed the changes appearing in the radiological images such as X-ray and CT scans. Using deep learning algorithms, the suspected patients' X-ray or Computed Tomography (CT) scan can differentiate between the healthy person and the patient affected by Coronavirus. In this paper, popular deep learning architectures are used to develop a Coronavirus diagnostic systems. The architectures used in this paper are VGG16, DenseNet121, Xception, NASNet, and EfficientNet. Multiclass classification is performed in this paper. The classes considered are COVID-19 positive patients, normal patients, and other class. In other class, chest X-ray images of pneumonia, influenza, and other illnesses related to the chest region are included. The accuracies obtained for VGG16, DenseNet121, Xception, NASNet, and EfficientNet are 79.01%, 89.96%, 88.03%, 85.03% and 93.48% respectively. The need for deep learning with radiologic images is necessary for this critical condition as this will provide a second opinion to the radiologists fast and accurately. These deep learning Coronavirus detection systems can also be useful in the regions where expert physicians and well-equipped clinics are not easily accessible.","Nigam, Bhawna; Nigam, Ayan; Jain, Rahul; Dodia, Shubham; Arora, Nidhi; B, Annappa",Expert Syst Appl,,646

304862,Aspects of Distance Education in Combination with Home Offices,2021,"The extensive proliferation of recent coronavirus (COVID-19), all over the world, is the outcome of social interactions through massive transportation, gatherings and population growth. To disrupt the widespread of COVID-19, a mechanism for social distancing is indispensable. Also, to predict the effectiveness and quantity of social distancing for a particular social network, with a certain contagion, a generalized model is needed. In this manuscript, we propose a social distancing mediated generalized model to predict the pandemic spread of COVID-19. By considering growth rate as a temporal harmonic function damped with social distancing in generalized Richard model and by using the data of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, USA and India, we find that, with time, the cumulative spread grows more rapidly due to weak social distancing as compared to the stronger social distancing, where it is explicitly decreasing. Furthermore, we predict the possible outcomes with various social distancing scenarios by considering highest growth rate as an initial state, and illustrate that the increase in social distancing tremendously decreases growth rate, even it tends to reach zero in lockdown regimes. Our findings not only provide epidemic growth scenarios as a function of social distancing but also provide a modified growth model to predict controlled information flow in any network.","Yasir, Kashif Ammar; Liu, Wu-Ming",Nonlinear Dyn,,646

OBJECTIVE: To analyze data on the first 1,510 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico, and to describe the geographical distribution of the disease and its transmission dynamics. METHOD: Description of the first COVID-19 cases with real-time RT-PCR-positive test, as well as evaluation of epidemiological measures, cumulative incidence, rate of transmission, and mortality and lethality rates during the first month of the epidemic. RESULTS: Average age was 43 years, and 58 % were males; 44 % of initial cases were imported. Lethality in the population during the first month went from 1.08 to 3.97 per 100 cases; however, the trend is linear and similar to that observed in Europe. CONCLUSIONS: In Mexico, social distancing is being applied, but studies are still required on the dynamics of the epidemic, person-to-person transmission, incidence of subclinical infections, and patient survival.","Ornelas-Aguirre, José M",Gac. med.

All of them recovered completely from their illness with resolution of symptoms following Ayurvedic treatment. The data was collected from patients treated during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (June 2020 to September 2020) at an out-patient Ayurvedic Clinic, Chennai, India. Clinical Presentation: This is a retrospective case series from among the initial 247 COVID-19 patients out of whom 39% were found to be suffering from comorbidities. We have chosen seven of these patients who fulfilled the criteria for high-risk category, represented by multiple comorbidities that included cancer, chronic kidney disease (CKD), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension and an elderly person over the age of 90 years. Intervention: Classical Ayurvedic formulations for COVID -19 were chosen so as to avoid complicating co-morbid conditions and patients were maintained on a modified diet. All these high-risk patients were treated at an outpatient setting. The patients were under home quarantine and self-monitored their progress with daily follow up over the phone by the treating Ayurvedic physician. Outcomes and Conclusions: The main outcome measure included resolution of symptoms and complete recovery from COVID-19 disease in all patients.This case series demonstrates the scope of Ayurvedic interventions in management of high risk COVID-19 patients with severe comorbidities with successful outcome in an out-patient setting.","Girija, P L T; Sivan, Nithya; Naik, Pallavi; Murugavel, Yamini Agalya; Ravindranath Thyyar, M; Krishnaswami, C V",,,646

METHODS: A total of 612 volunteers between the ages of 18-38 enrolled in the study, 418 of them were athletes engaged in team sports or individual sports and 194 of them were non-athletes. Participants completed the Depression - Anxiety - Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21), the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ). Non-parametric methods were used for comparisons between groups. The presence of a linear relationship was tested with the Spearman Correlation Test. A value of p < 0.05 was accepted statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 571 participants, 372 males and 199 females, completed the study. Depression and anxiety symptoms were lower in athletes compared to non-athletes (p < 0.05). Depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were similar in team athletes and individual athletes (p = 0.232, p = 0.444, p = 0.116; respectively). The post-traumatic stress symptoms were lower in male team athletes than female team athletes (p = 0.020) and non-athletes (p < 0.001). Depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were found to be similar in men and women (p > 0.05). There was a negative correlation between physical activity level and mental health symptoms (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The mental health status of athletes was better than non-athletes, and the positive effect of sport, which was done until the break due to the isolation period, on mental health continued. These findings show that physical activity may help to protect mental health.","Senisik, Seçkin; Denerel, Nevzad; Köyagasioglu, Ogün; Tunç, Serhat",Phys Sportsmed,,646

In this study, we implemented a previously described fast and simple lanthanum-based protocol for concentration of norovirus genogroup I (GI), genogroup II (GII) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) in drinking and surface water. We compared the results with those of a widely used skimmed milk flocculation method, followed by nucleic acid extraction and RT-qPCR detection. Three seeding levels, with intended concentrations 5 × 103, 5 × 104 and 5 × 105 genome copies/10 L, were added to drinking water or surface water. All seed levels were detected with both flocculation methods. Samples extracted with skimmed milk flocculation had on average 1.82, 1.86 and 1.38 times higher measured concentration of norovirus GI, GII and HAV, respectively, than those extracted with lanthanum flocculation, across all seeding levels and water types tested. Mengovirus was used as a positive process control. Mengovirus recovery was higher for skimmed milk (40.7% in drinking water, 26.0% in surface water) than for lanthanum flocculation (24.4% in drinking water, 9.7% in surface water). Together, this indicates that skimmed milk flocculation provides higher viral recovery than lanthanum flocculation. However, lanthanum-based flocculation can be performed much faster than skimmed milk flocculation (1.5 h versus 16 h flocculation time) and thus could be a good alternative for rapid monitoring of viruses in water.","Borgmästars, Emmy; Persson, Sofia; Hellmér, Maria; Simonsson, Magnus; Eriksson, Ronnie",Food environ. virol.

Seventy-seven people detected with low viral loads of SARs-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples (Ct ≥ 35) were enrolled in the study. For this purpose, a second NPS was collected for rRT-PCR (real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) combined with a pair of serum samples for detection of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) and anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies. In 8 people, subsequent examinations indicated an increase in viral loads, thereafter, followed by an increase of anti-N and anti-S antibodies, findings compatible with an early stage of COVID-19 infection. In 9 people, who already had increased anti-N antibodies, subsequent examination showed a decrease or absence of viral load and an increase in antibodies, indicative of a late stage of COVID-19 infection.

316770,La gestione delle frontiere ai tempi del coronavirus,2020,"In the context of rising disasters worldwide and the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, this commentary considers the implications of findings in resilience science on children and youth for disaster preparation and response. The multisystem challenges posed by disasters are illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We discuss the significance of disasters in the history of resilience science and the emergence of a unifying systems definition of resilience. Principles of a multisystem perspective on resilience and major findings on what matters for young people in disasters are delineated with reference to the pandemic. Striking parallels are noted in the psychosocial resilience factors identified at the level of individual children, families, schools, and communities. These parallels suggest that adaptive capacities associated with resilience in these interacting systems reflect interconnected networks and processes that co-evolved and may operate in concert. As resilience science moves toward integrated theory, knowledge, and applications in practice, particularly in disaster risk reduction and resilience promotion, more focus will be needed on multisystem and multidisciplinary research, communication, training, and planning.","Masten, Ann S; Motti-Stefanidi, Frosso",Advers Resil Sci,,646

This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 whilst on anticancer treatment in a developing country. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of all adult cancer patients at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan, from March 15, 2020 to July 10, 2020, diagnosed with COVID-19 within 4 weeks of receiving anticancer treatment, where a purposive sampling was performed. Cancer patients who did not receive anticancer treatment and clinical or radiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test were excluded. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality after 30 days of COVID-19 test. Data was analyzed with SPSS version 23 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Categorical parameters were computed using chi-square test, keeping p value < 0.05 as significant. RESULTS: A total of 201 cancer patients with COVID-19 were analyzed. The median age of patients was 45 (18-78) years. Mild symptoms were present in 162 (80.6%) patients, whereas severe symptoms were present in 39 (19.4%) patients. The risk of death was statistically significant (p < .05) amongst patients with age greater than 50 years, metastatic disease, and ongoing palliative anticancer treatment. Anticancer treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, and surgery) received within preceding 4 weeks had no statistically significant (p > .05) impact on mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In cancer patients with COVID-19, mortality appears to be principally driven by age, advanced stage of the disease, and palliative intent of cancer treatment.

This study aimed to compare prevalence rates of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder in national samples in the U.S. before and during the pandemic. METHODS: Participants (n = 336,525) were from U.S. Census Bureau-administered nationally representative probability samples, one from the first half of 2019 and four during the pandemic in April and May 2020. All participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 screening for depressive disorder and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 screening for anxiety disorders. RESULTS: Compared to U.S. adults in 2019, U.S. adults in April and May 2020 were more than three times as likely to screen positive for depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, or one or both, with more than one out of three screening positive for one or both. The prevalence of anxiety decreased slightly between the April 23-May 4, 2020 and the May 21-26, 2020 administrations, while the prevalence of depression increased slightly. CONCLUSIONS: U.S. adults in 2020 are considerably more likely to screen positive for mood disorders than in 2019, with anxiety declining and depression increasing from April to May.","Twenge, Jean M; Joiner, Thomas E",Depress. anxiety,,646

319719,Coronavirus lockdown and virus suppression: an international analysis,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The spread of COVID-19 has led to severe strain on hospital capacity in many countries. We aim to develop a model helping planners assess expected COVID-19 hospital resource utilization based on individual patient characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We develop a model of patient clinical course based on an advanced multistate survival model. The model predicts the patient's disease course in terms of clinical states-critical, severe, or moderate. The model also predicts hospital utilization on the level of entire hospitals or healthcare systems. We cross-validated the model using a nationwide registry following the day-by-day clinical status of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Israel from March 1st to May 2nd, 2020 (n = 2,703). RESULTS: Per-day mean absolute errors for predicted total and critical-care hospital-bed utilization were 4.72 ± 1.07 and 1.68 ± 0.40 respectively, over cohorts of 330 hospitalized patients; AUCs for prediction of critical illness and in-hospital mortality were 0.88 ± 0.04 and 0.96 ± 0.04, respectively. We further present the impact of patient influx scenarios on day-by-day healthcare system utilization. We provide an accompanying R software package. DISCUSSION: The proposed model accurately predicts total and critical-care hospital utilization. The model enables evaluating impacts of patient influx scenarios on utilization, accounting for the state of currently hospitalized patients and characteristics of incoming patients. We show that accurate hospital-load predictions were possible using only a patient's age, sex, and day-by-day clinical state (critical, severe or moderate). CONCLUSION: The multistate model we develop is a powerful tool for predicting individual-level patient outcomes and hospital-level utilization.","Roimi, Michael; Gutman, Rom; Somer, Jonathan; Ben Arie, Asaf; Calman, Ido; Bar-Lavie, Yaron; Gelbshtein, Udi; Liverant-Taub, Sigal; Ziv, Arnona; Eytan, Danny; Gorfine, Malka; Shalit, Uri",J. am. med. inform. assoc,,646

To the best of our knowledge, there are no recommendations about the best time to initiate high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of all patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia who required HNFO between March 2020 and February 2021. Patients were grouped in early HNFC or late HNFC, according to the modified Kirby index. RESULTS: 53 patients were included. Forty-four of them were included in the early HFNC and 9 in late HNFC. There were no statistically significant clinical-epidemiological differences. Early use of HFNC was associated with a decrease in the need for intubation (29.5 vs. 66.6%, p = 0.044), hospital stay (18.8 d vs. 36 d, p = 0.022) and mortality (22.7 vs. 55.5%, p = 0.061).

DESIGN: A descriptive literature review was performed. The search of the literature was conducted through using electronic databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Cochrane library. SETTING: A wide range of published articles focused on child malnutrition were reviewed. PARTICIPANTS: The study was focused on children especially those under 5 years. RESULTS: The current study proposes strategic responses to reduce child undernutrition. These responses include strengthening access to community-based nutrition services that support the early detection and treatment of undernourished children and emergency food distribution, including fortified foods with vitamins and minerals, to vulnerable households, particularly those with children under 5 years. Moreover, counseling and promotion programmes should be reinforced to revitalise community nutrition education in areas such as gestation, exclusive breast-feeding and complementary feeding, and hygienic practices involving handwashing, proper sanitation and other basic behavioural changes. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many countries especially those in the regions of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa in which there has been an ongoing burden of child undernutrition. However, malnutrition is preventable and can be eliminated through a multisectoral strategic approach. The effective execution of a multisectoral approach towards preventing childhood malnutrition will require not only a financial investment but also the collective efforts from different ministries of the governments, UN-affiliated agencies and non-governmental organisations.","Ntambara, James; Chu, Minjie",Public Health Nutr,,646

Materials and methods: A questionnaire using a 3-point Likert scale was distributed to 400 undergraduate dental students of a dental institute. The survey form distribution and data collection were done using Google Forms. The data were entered into an excel spreadsheet and analyzed using SPSS version 15. Chi-square test and Fischer’s exact test were applied to know the association of perception of undergraduate dental students toward online lectures with gender and their year of course. Results: A total of 356 students responded to the survey with a response rate of 89%. While the majority of students (77.8%) had a good experience in understanding online lectures, only 18% of students found online lectures to be more impactful than classroom lectures. Also, a statistically significant difference was found among students in a different year of the course (p = 0.04). Approximately 49% of the students with a higher number of males (69.6%) as compared to females (43.9%) felt that online lectures needed further improvement to support their learning (p = 0.001). While 58% of students preferred the inclusion of online lectures in future dental education, 76.4% of students said that they would prefer a combination of both online lectures and classroom lectures. Conclusion: Students had a positive response toward online lectures. However, based on the results, it can be concluded that the e-learning system needs further improvement to support students’ learning and it can only be considered as an adjunct to traditional classroom lectures. Clinical significance: The concept of online teaching was explored globally in view of the pandemic of COVID-19. The use of online lectures, webinars, and continuing dental education was very helpful and informative for dental students. The curriculum and teaching were possible even in lockdown, maintaining social distancing. Thus, this study helps to find out the perception and understanding of dental students toward online lectures and teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic. © Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers. 2021.","Patil, D.; Singh, S.; Katge, F.; Jain, R.; Bhanushali, N.; Bhanushali, P.",World Journal of Dentistry,,646
325699,"Effects of socio-demographics, sense of control, and uncertainty avoidability on post-COVID-19 vacation intention",2020,"Official COVID-19 mortality statistics are strongly influenced by the local diagnostic capacity, strength of the healthcare system, and the recording and reporting capacities on causes of death. This can result in significant undercounting of COVID-19 attributable deaths, making it challenging to understand the total mortality burden of the pandemic. Excess mortality, which is defined as the increase in observed death counts compared to a baseline expectation, provides an alternate measure of the mortality shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we use data from civil death registers for 54 municipalities across the state of Gujarat, India, to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all-cause mortality. Using a model fit to monthly data from January 2019 to February 2020, we estimate excess mortality over the course of the pandemic from March 2020 to April 2021. We estimated 16,000 [95% CI: 14,000, 18,000] excess deaths across these municipalities since March 2020. The sharpest increase in deaths was observed in April 2021, with an estimated 480% [95% CI: 390%, 580%] increase in mortality from expected counts for the same period. Females and the 40 to 60 age groups experienced a greater increase from baseline mortality compared to other demographic groups. Our excess mortality estimate for these 54 municipalities, representing approximately 5% of the state population, exceeds the official COVID-19 death count for the entire state of Gujarat.","Acosta, Rolando J; Patnaik, Biraj; Buckee, Caroline; Balsari, Satchit; Mahmud, Ayesha",,,646
325808,Bahraini Public’s Dependency on Social Media as a Source of Information About COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE: Non-urgent face-to-face outpatient ophthalmology appointments were suspended in the United Kingdom in March 2020, due to the COVID-19 outbreak. In common with other centres, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (London) offered modified telephone consultations to new and follow-up patients in the low vision clinic. Here we assess the success of this telephone service. METHODS: Data were collected for 500 consecutive telephone low vision appointments. Successful completion of the assessment and clinical outcomes (low vision aids prescribed, onward referral) were recorded. RESULTS: Telephone assessments were completed for 364 people (72.8%). The most common reasons for non-completion were either no answer to the telephone call (75 people, 15%), or the patient declining assessment (20 people, 4%). There was no association between age and the likelihood of an assessment being completed. 131 new low vision aids were dispensed, 77 internal referrals were made and 15 people were referred to outside services. More than 80% of the low vision aids prescribed were useful. CONCLUSIONS: Telephone low vision assessments were completed in about three-quarters of cases. About one-quarter of consultations resulted in new low vision aids being dispensed, which were generally found useful. Telephone low vision assessments can be used successfully in a large low vision clinic, but have many limitations when compared to face-to-face assessments.","Patel, Ankit; Fothergill, Alicia S; Barnard, Katy E C; Dunbar, Hannah; Crossland, Michael D",Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,,646

Users on social networks publish a large number of comments about this event. These comments contain important hidden information of public opinion regarding this pandemic. In this research, a large number of Coronavirus-related tweets are considered and analyzed using natural language processing and information retrieval science. Initially, the location of the tweets is determined using a dictionary prepared through the Geo-Names geographic database, which contains detailed and complete information of places such as city names, streets, and postal codes. Then, using a large dictionary prepared from the terms of economics, related tweets are extracted and sentiments corresponded to tweets are analyzed with the help of the RoBERTa language-based model, which has high accuracy and good performance. Finally, the frequency chart of tweets related to the economy and their sentiment scores (positive and negative tweets) is plotted over time for the entire world and the top 10 economies. From the analysis of the charts, we learn that the reason for publishing economic tweets is not only the increase in the number of people infected with the Coronavirus but also imposed restrictions and lockdowns in countries. The consequences of these restrictions include the loss of millions of jobs and the economic downturn.","Salmani, Fatemeh; Vahdat-Nejad, Hamed; Hajiabadi, Hamideh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02198v1.pdf,646
326130,Flatten the Curve and Stock Market Liquidity – An Inquiry into Emerging Economies,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The four seasonal coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 are frequent causes of respiratory infections and show annual and seasonal variation. Increased understanding about these patterns could be informative about the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Results from PCR diagnostics for the seasonal coronaviruses, and other respiratory viruses, were obtained for 55,190 clinical samples analyzed at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, between 14 September 2009 and 2 April 2020. RESULTS: Seasonal coronaviruses were detected in 2130 samples (3.9 %) and constituted 8.1 % of all virus detections. OC43 was most commonly detected (28.4 % of detections), followed by NL63 (24.0 %), HKU1 (17.6 %), and 229E (15.3 %). The overall fraction of positive samples was similar between seasons, but at species level there were distinct biennial alternating peak seasons for the Alphacoronaviruses, 229E and NL63, and the Betacoronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1, respectively. The Betacoronaviruses peaked earlier in the winter season (Dec-Jan) than the Alphacoronaviruses (Feb-Mar). Coronaviruses were detected across all ages, but diagnostics were more frequently requested for paediatric patients than adults and the elderly. OC43 and 229E incidence was relatively constant across age strata, while that of NL63 and HKU1 decreased with age. CONCLUSIONS: Both the Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses showed alternating biennial winter incidence peaks, which suggests some type of immune mediated interaction. Symptomatic reinfections in adults and the elderly appear relatively common. Both findings may be of relevance for the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.","Dyrdak, Robert; Hodcroft, Emma B; Wahlund, Martina; Neher, Richard A; Albert, Jan",J Clin Virol,,646

Prenatal education and breastfeeding may reduce the risk of diabetes in mothers and offspring. The rates of breastfeeding initiation and participation in the prenatal program are low in FN communities. Methods A prenatal educational website, social media-assisted prenatal chat groups and community support teams were developed in three rural or remote FN communities in Manitoba. The rates of participation of pregnant women in prenatal programs and breastfeeding initiation were compared before and after the start of the remote prenatal education program within 2014-2017. Findings The participation rate of FN pregnant women in rural or remote communities in the prenatal program and breastfeeding initiation during 1-year after the start of the community-based remote prenatal education program were significantly increased compared to that during 1-year before the start of the program (54% versus 36% for the participation rate, 50% versus 34% for breastfeeding initiation, p &lt; 0·001). Availability of high-speed Wi-Fi and/or postpartum supporting team were associated with favorite study outcomes. Positive feedback on the remote prenatal education was received from participants. Interpretation The findings suggest that remote prenatal education is feasible and effective for improving the breastfeeding rate and engaging pregnant women to participate in the prenatal program in rural or remote FN communities. The remote prenatal education remained active during COVID-19 in the participating communities, which suggests an advantage to expand remote prenatal education in other Indigenous communities.

In the absence of targeted therapies, supportive care continues to be the mainstay of treatment. The hallmark of severe COVID-19 is a thromboinflammatory storm driven by innate immune responses. This manifests clinically as acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in some patients, widespread thrombotic microangiopathy. Neutrophils and complement are key players in the innate immune system, and their role in perpetuating fatal severe COVID-19 continues to receive increasing attention. Here, we review the interplay between neutrophils, neutrophil extracellular traps, and complement in COVID-19 immunopathology, and highlight potential therapeutic strategies to combat these pathways.","Zuo, Yu; Kanthi, Yogendra; Knight, Jason S; Kim, Alfred H J",Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol,,646

Today's avalanche of conflicting news on how to deal with the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) brings to mind the Trinity nuclear bomb test with Enrico Fermi estimating its strength by releasing small pieces of paper into the air and measuring their displacement by the shock wave. Fermi's result, in fact not far from the true value, emphasised his ability to make good approximations with few or no actual data. The current wave of Covid-19 presents just this kind of situation as it engulfs the world from ground zero in Wuhan, China.

This was a retrospective study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients over 18 years old between March 2020 and May 2020. Patients were diagnosed to have COVID-19 based either on chest computed tomography findings or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test. Age, gender, chronic medical conditions, and laboratory values including hemogram parameters (white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer, ferritin, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and the international normalized ratio were recorded. Overall, we included 302 patients. Of these, 148 patients were male; the male to female ratio was 0.961. The mean age of the entire study cohort was 57.1 ± 17.6 years. The most common chronic medical condition was hypertension (38.1%). Half of the patients received low molecular weight heparin. During the study period, 25 patients (8.2%) died. White blood cell count and neutrophil count were significantly higher, whereas lymphocyte count was significantly lower in the deceased patients. The median neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was 11.6 in the deceased patients, it was significantly higher than the surviving patients (p < 0.001). The values of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and ferritin were significantly higher among the deceased patients. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and the international normalized ratio were significantly longer in the deceased group compared with the surviving group. Logistic regression analysis showed age > 65 years, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, and hypertension as the independent predictors of mortality. The rate of abnormal inflammatory and hematologic-coagulation parameters increased with the COVID-19 severity. Age > 65 years, hypertension, activated partial thromboplastin time and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio were the independent predictors of mortality.","Keski, Hakan",Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,,646

330016,Trading privacy for social good: Did America unite during COVID-19?,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly expanding global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. A substantial minority of patients hospitalized develop an acute COVID-19 cardiovascular syndrome, which can manifest with a variety of clinical presentations but often presents as an acute cardiac injury with cardiomyopathy, ventricular arrhythmias, and hemodynamic instability in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. The cause of this injury is uncertain but is suspected to be related to myocarditis, microvascular injury, systemic cytokine-mediated injury, or stress-related cardiomyopathy. Although histologically unproven, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has the potential to directly replicate within cardiomyocytes and pericytes, leading to viral myocarditis. Systemically elevated cytokines are also known to be cardiotoxic and have the potential to result in profound myocardial injury. Prior experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 has helped expedite the evaluation of several promising therapies, including antiviral agents, interleukin-6 inhibitors, and convalescent serum. Management of acute COVID-19 cardiovascular syndrome should involve a multidisciplinary team including intensive care specialists, infectious disease specialists, and cardiologists. Priorities for managing acute COVID-19 cardiovascular syndrome include balancing the goals of minimizing healthcare staff exposure for testing that will not change clinical management with early recognition of the syndrome at a time point at which intervention may be most effective. This article aims to review the best available data on acute COVID-19 cardiovascular syndrome epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. From these data, we propose a surveillance, diagnostic, and management strategy that balances potential patient risks and healthcare staff exposure with improvement in meaningful clinical outcomes.","Hendren, Nicholas S; Drazner, Mark H; Bozkurt, Biykem; Cooper, Leslie T",Circulation,,646

331269,Online teaching practicum during COVID-19: the case of a teacher education program in Greece,2021,"Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies provides important research and diagnostic information relating to COVID-19 prevalence, incidence and host immune response. A greater understanding of the relationship between functionally neutralising antibodies detected using microneutralisation assays and binding antibodies detected using scalable enzyme immunoassays (EIA) is needed in order to address protective immunity post-infection or vaccination, and assess EIA suitability as a surrogate test for screening of convalescent plasma donors. We assessed whether neutralising antibody titres correlated with signal cut-off ratios in five commercially available EIAs, and one in-house assay based on expressed spike protein targets. Sera from recovered patients or convalescent plasma donors who reported laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 200), and negative control sera collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 100), were assessed in parallel. Performance was assessed by calculating EIA sensitivity and specificity with reference to microneutralisation. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 166 (83%) samples. Compared with this, the most sensitive EIAs were the Cobas Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (98%) and Vitros Immunodiagnostic Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (100%), which detect total antibody targeting the N and S1 antigens, respectively. The assay with the best quantitative relationship with microneutralisation was the Euroimmun IgG. These results suggest the marker used (total Ab vs. IgG vs. IgA) and the target antigen are important determinants of assay performance. The strong correlation between microneutralisation and some commercially available assays demonstrates their potential for clinical and research use in assessing protection following infection or vaccination, and use as a surrogate test to assess donor suitability for convalescent plasma donation.","Walker, Gregory J; Naing, Zin; Ospina Stella, Alberto; Yeang, Malinna; Caguicla, Joanna; Ramachandran, Vidiya; Isaacs, Sonia R; Agapiou, David; Bull, Rowena A; Stelzer-Braid, Sacha; Daly, James; Gosbell, Iain B; Hoad, Veronica C; Irving, David O; Pink, Joanne M; Turville, Stuart; Kelleher, Anthony D; Rawlinson, William D",Viruses,,646

This study examines the respective association of these mutations with infection in persons who had previously received a COVID-19 vaccine. MethodsGenetic sequences from SARS-CoV-2 specimens collected from Maryland residents and reported to Maryland Department of Health were linked to vaccination history. The prevalence of infections in fully vaccinated persons -- defined as being at least two weeks past receiving the final scheduled dose of a COVID-19 vaccine series -- was compared between infections caused by viruses carrying E484K to those not carrying E484K, and between infections caused by viruses carrying L452R to those not carrying L452R, using logistic regression to adjust for confounding. ResultsOf 9,048 sequenced SARS-CoV-2 specimens examined, 265 (2.9%) were collected from fully vaccinated persons. In adjusted analysis, the E484K substitution was associated with an increase in the odds of the sequenced specimen being collected from a fully vaccinated person (OR 1.96, 95% CI, 1.36 to 2.83). The L452R mutation was not significantly associated with infections in vaccinated persons (OR 1.07, 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.68). ConclusionThough more than 97% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were in persons who were not fully vaccinated, the E484K mutation was associated with increased odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated persons. Linking vaccination and sequencing data can help identify and estimate the impact SARS-CoV-2 mutations may have on vaccine effectiveness. SummaryIn viruses sequenced for Marylands routine SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance, the spike protein amino acid substitution E484K was more prevalent in viruses that infected vaccinated people than in viruses that infected people who were not vaccinated.","Feder, Kenneth Aaron; Patel, Ami; Vepachedu, Venkata R; Dominguez, Catherine; Keller, Eric N; Klein, Liore; Kim, Curi; Blood, Tim; Hyun, Judie; Williams, Theo; Feldman, Katherine Anne; Mostafa, Heba H; Morris, Christopher Paul; Ravel, Jacques; Duwell, Monique; Blythe, David; Myers, Robert",,,646

Finding a rapid, easy-to-use, and cheap diagnostic method is necessary to help control the current outbreak. Microfluidic systems provide a platform for many diagnostic tests, including RT-PCR, RT-LAMP, nested-PCR, nucleic acid hybridization, ELISA, fluorescence-Based Assays, rolling circle amplification, aptamers, sample preparation multiplexer (SPM), Porous Silicon Nanowire Forest, silica sol-gel coating/bonding, and CRISPR. They promise faster, cheaper, and easy-to-use methods with higher sensitivity, so microfluidic devices have a high potential to be an alternative method for the detection of viral RNA.

334373,Recovery from corona virus 19,2020,"The Genomics Education Partnership (GEP) is a community of practice focused on integrating genomics research experiences into undergraduate curriculum and supporting faculty in this endeavor. Founded in 2006, GEP has grown to over 100 participating two-year and four-year institutions and introduced thousands of students to eukaryotic gene structure, comparative genomics, and genome evolution. GEP members contribute their expertise and enthusiasm to the community through four committees: science and IT, curriculum development, assessment, and professional development and mentoring. Digital communication tools facilitate collaboration in this geographically distributed community while regional nodes enable the development of local initiatives. Our education research is focused on student experiences, attitudes, and learning gains in the CURE setting. An important dimension of CUREs that distinguishes them from the traditional laboratory classroom is iteration: students have opportunities to make mistakes and re-do (Auchincloss et al, 2014). The scaling of undergraduate research from an apprentice model to the classroom, however, poses a major challenge for faculty, creating the need to provide feedback to a large number of inexperienced student researchers. We find that custom bioinformatics tools provide rapid feedback to GEP students and allow for iterative revisions of student projects. Student surveys and focus groups reveal that bioinformatics CUREs foster ?formative frustration,? whereby students can safely fail in their original analysis, adjust, recover, and succeed;students value this experience. During the COVID pandemic, GEP has provided an authentic research experience that can be delivered remotely. Bioinformatics resources are available online, as are GEP virtual tutors. Thus, GEP is a viable option for undergraduate research projects even for online learning. We are expanding our repertoire of scientific projects. GEP has partnered with Galaxy to develop G-OnRamp, an open-source platform for constructing UCSC Assembly Hubs and JBrowse/Apollo genome browsers to facilitate collaborative annotation of eukaryotic genomes. These tools allow us to include investigations of the evolution of venom in parasitoid wasps and an investigation of the evolution of genes in Drosophila biochemical pathways. We seek to grow our network of faculty and to increase the diversity of our community by making a variety of training opportunities available, including online mentoring via the QUBES platform and regional node workshops. We have created a supportive community of faculty and welcome new colleagues (no experience necessary!) eager for the challenge of bringing genomics research to undergraduate students at all levels.

Here we focus on statistical predictions of COVID-19 infections performed by fitting asymptotic distributions to actual data. By taking as a case-study the epidemic evolution of total COVID-19 infections in Chinese provinces and Italian regions, we find that predictions are characterized by large uncertainties at the early stages of the epidemic growth. Those uncertainties significantly reduce after the epidemics peak is reached. Differences in the uncertainty of the forecasts at a regional level can be used to highlight the delay in the spread of the virus. Our results warn that long term extrapolation of epidemics counts must be handled with extreme care as they crucially depend not only on the quality of data, but also on the stage of the epidemics, due to the intrinsically non-linear nature of the underlying dynamics. These results suggest that real-time epidemiological projections should include wide uncertainty ranges and urge for the needs of compiling high-quality datasets of infections counts, including asymptomatic patients.","Alberti, Tommaso; Faranda, Davide",Comm.

We assessed the number of visits to the oncology department during 2020 compared to the number of visits and treatment protocols for malignant melanoma. During the first lockdown, the attendance at the plastic surgery outpatient clinic and ambulatory surgery decreased significantly (P = 0.002), both in excisions of suspected malignant melanoma and malignant melanoma follow-ups (P = 0.019 and P = 0.035, respectively). The last third of 2020 (from September to December) had shown a significant rise in new protocols commenced (P < 0.001). This rise in the final third of the year was not noted in 2018 or 2019. These data clearly show the rise in advanced and metastatic malignant melanoma cases due to refraining from medical follow-ups and treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Diseases other than COVID-19 have not vanished, and continue to treat those diseases. Ignoring malignant melanoma treatment because of COVID-19 and vice-versa will not benefit our patients.","Pikkel, Yoav Yechezkel; Duek, Ori Samuel; Ben Naftali, Yeela; Link, Yuval; Khayr, Majd; Ullmann, Yehuda",Melanoma Res,,646

METHODS: There were 308 hospital-acquired AKI and 721 non-AKI (NAKI) COVID-19 patients from Stony Brook Hospital (New York, USA) data, and 72 hospital-acquired AKI and 303 NAKI COVID-19 patients from Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China). Demographic, comorbidities, and longitudinal (3 days before and 3 days after AKI onset) clinical variables were used to compute odds ratios for and longitudinally predict hospital-acquired AKI onset. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with AKI were more likely to die than NAKI patients (31.5% vs 6.9%, adjusted p < 0.001, OR = 4.67 [95% CI 3.1, 7.0], Stony Brook data). AKI developed on average 3.3 days after hospitalization. Procalcitonin was elevated prior to AKI onset (p < 0.05), peaked, and remained elevated (p < 0.05). Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase peaked the same time as creatinine, whereas D-dimer and brain natriuretic peptide peaked a day later. C-reactive protein, white blood cell and lymphocyte showed group differences - 2 days prior (p < 0.05). Top predictors were creatinine, procalcitonin, white blood cells, lactate dehydrogenase, and lymphocytes. They predicted AKI onset with areas under curves (AUCs) of 0.78, 0.66, and 0.56 at 0, - 1, and - 2 days prior, respectively. When tested on the Tongji Hospital data, the AUCs were 0.80, 0.79, and 0.77, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Time-locked longitudinal data provide insight into AKI progression. Commonly clinical variables reasonably predict AKI onset a few days prior. This work may lead to earlier recognition of AKI and treatment to improve clinical outcomes.","Lu, Justin Y; Hou, Wei; Duong, Tim Q",Infection,,646
338969,A Preliminary Test of the Impact of De-Globalization on MNC Performance,2021,"Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically changed how comprehensive ophthalmology practices care for patients. Objective: To report practice patterns for common ocular complaints during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic among comprehensive ophthalmology practices in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, 40 private practices and 20 university centers were randomly selected from 4 regions across the US. Data were collected on April 29 and 30, 2020. Interventions: Investigators placed telephone calls to each ophthalmology practice office. Responses to 3 clinical scenarios-refraction request, cataract evaluation, and symptoms of a posterior vitreous detachment-were compared regionally and between private and university centers. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary measure was time to next appointment for each of the 3 scenarios. Secondary measures included use of telemedicine and advertisement of COVID-19 precautions. Results: Of the 40 private practices, 2 (5%) were closed, 24 (60%) were only seeing urgent patients, and 14 (35%) remained open to all patients. Of the 20 university centers, 2 (10%) were closed, 17 (85%) were only seeing urgent patients, and 1 (5%) remained open to all patients. There were no differences for any telemedicine metric. University centers were more likely than private practices to mention preparations to limit the spread of COVID-19 (17 of 20 [85%] vs 14 of 40 [35%]; mean difference, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.26-0.65; P < .001). Private practices had a faster next available appointment for cataract evaluations than university centers, with a mean (SD) time to visit of 22.1 (27.0) days vs 75.5 (46.1) days (mean difference, 53.4; 95% CI, 23.1-83.7; P < .001). Private practices were also more likely than university centers to be available to see patients with flashes and floaters (30 of 40 [75%] vs 8 of 20 [40%]; mean difference, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22-0.79; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of investigator telephone calls to ophthalmology practice offices, there were uniform recommendations for the 3 routine ophthalmic complaints. Private practices had shorter times to next available appointment for cataract extraction and were more likely to evaluate posterior vitreous detachment symptoms. As there has not been a study examining these practice patterns before the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevance of these findings on public health is yet to be determined.","Starr, Matthew R; Israilevich, Rachel; Zhitnitsky, Michael; Cheng, Qianqian E; Soares, Rebecca R; Patel, Luv G; Ammar, Michael J; Khan, M Ali; Yonekawa, Yoshihiro; Ho, Allen C; Cohen, Michael N; Sridhar, Jayanth; Kuriyan, Ajay E",JAMA Ophthalmol,,646

339306,"Nation-state, education and the fabrication of national-minded citizens (Introduction)",2020,"BACKGROUND: There is lack of data on feasibility and safety of kidney transplants from living donors who recovered from COVID-19. METHODS: Here, we present a retrospective cohort study of 31 kidney transplant recipients (KTR) from living donors who recovered from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19 across 19 transplant centers in India from July 3, 2020 to December 5, 2020. We detailed demographics, clinical manifestations, immunosuppression regimen, treatment and outcomes. Donors with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 were accepted after documenting 2 negative PCR tests with complete symptom resolution for at least 28 days and significant social distancing for 14 days prior to surgery. RESULTS: COVID-19 clinical severity in donors ranged from completely asymptomatic (71%, n=22) to mild infection (29%, n=9). None progressed to moderate or severe stages of the disease in the entire clinical course of home treatment. Patient and graft survival was 100% respectively with acute cellular rejection being reported in 6.4% (n=2) recipient. All recipients and donors were asymptomatic with normal creatinine at median follow-up of 44 days after surgery without any complications relating to surgery and /or COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support safety of proceeding with living donation for asymptomatic individuals with comprehensive donor, recipients screening before surgery, using a combination of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory criteria. It could provide new insights into the management of KTR from living donors who have recovered from COVID-19 in India. To the best of our knowledge, this remains the largest cohort of KTR from living donors who recovered from COVID-19.","Kute, Vivek B; Godara, Suraj; Guleria, Sandeep; Ray, Deepak S; Aziz, Feroz; Hegde, Umapati; Sharma, Ashish; Nayak, K S; Siddini, Vishwanath; Sarkar, Piyali; Thukral, Sharmila; Mondal, Rabi Ranjan Sow; Goswami, Jitendra; Patel, Himanshu V; Abraham M, Abi; Pathak, Vivek; Anandh, Urmila; Jha, Pranaw Kumar; Bavikar, Suhas; Bonu, Ravi Shankar; Gulati, Sanjeev; B T, Anil Kumar; Yadav, Dinesh Kumar",Transplantation,,646

The aims were to document the transition across diverse sites and to present recommendations for future telehealth service planning. METHOD: Consortium sites completed a Qualtrics survey assessing site characteristics, telehealth practices, service use, and barriers to and facilitators of telehealth service delivery prior to (pre) and during the early stages of (post) the COVID-19 pandemic. The design is descriptive. RESULTS: All sites pivoted from in-person services to home-based telehealth within 2 weeks. Some sites experienced delays in conducting new intakes, and most experienced delays establishing tele-group therapy. No-show rates and use of telephony versus videoconferencing varied by site. Changes in telehealth practices (eg, documentation requirements, safety protocols) and perceived barriers to telehealth service delivery (eg, regulatory limitations, inability to bill) occurred pre-/post-COVID-19. CONCLUSION: A rapid pivot from in-person services to home-based telehealth occurred at 8 diverse academic programs in the context of a global health crisis. To promote ongoing use of home-based telehealth during future crises and usual care, academic programs should continue documenting the successes and barriers to telehealth practice to promote equitable and sustainable telehealth service delivery in the future.","Folk, Johanna B; Schiel, Marissa A; Oblath, Rachel; Feuer, Vera; Sharma, Aditi; Khan, Shabana; Doan, Bridget; Kulkarni, Chetana; Ramtekkar, Ujjwal; Hawks, Jessica; Fornari, Victor; Fortuna, Lisa R; Myers, Kathleen",J.

Although disrupting the viral life cycle is critical for limiting viral spread and disease, it has proven challenging to develop targeted and selective therapeutics. Synthetic lethality offers a promising but largely unexploited strategy against infectious viral disease; as viruses infect cells, they abnormally alter the cell state, unwittingly exposing new vulnerabilities in the infected cell. Therefore, we propose that effective therapies can be developed to selectively target the virally reconfigured host cell networks that accompany altered cellular states to cripple the host cell that has been converted into a virus factory, thus disrupting the viral life cycle.","Mast, Fred D; Navare, Arti T; van der Sloot, Almer M; Coulombe-Huntington, Jasmin; Rout, Michael P; Baliga, Nitin S; Kaushansky, Alexis; Chait, Brian T; Aderem, Alan; Rice, Charles M; Sali, Andrej; Tyers, Mike; Aitchison, John D",J. cell. biol,,646

We hypothesized that children with COVID-19 have favorable postoperative outcomes compared to the reported adult experience. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study for children with a confirmed preoperative COVID-19 diagnosis from April 1st, 2020 to August 15th, 2020 at a free-standing children's hospital. Primary outcomes evaluated were postoperative complications, readmissions, reoperations, and mortality within 30 days of operation. Secondary outcomes included hospital resource utilization, hospital length of stay, and postoperative oxygen support. RESULTS: A total of 66 children with preoperative confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated with median age of 9.5 years (interquartile range (IQR) 5-14) with 65% male and 70% Hispanic White. Sixty-five percent of patients had no comorbidities, with abdominal pain identified as the most common preoperative symptom (65%). Twenty-three percent of patients presented with no COVID-19 related symptoms. Eighty-two percent of patients had no preoperative chest imaging and 98% of patients did not receive preoperative oxygen support. General pediatric surgeons performed the majority of procedures (68%) with the most common diagnosis appendicitis (47%). Forty-one percent of patients were discharged the same day as surgery with 9% of patients utilizing postoperative intensive care unit resources and only 5% receiving postoperative invasive mechanical ventilation.

Two manifold learning methods, isometric feature mapping and locally linear embedding, are applied to the analysis of reaction trajectories, which are calculated by the quasi-classical trajectory approach on a newly developed accurate quartet state NH3+(4A) potential energy surface for a multichannel reaction NH+ + H2 â N + H3+/NH2+ + H. The results show that isometric feature mapping can clearly identify different reaction paths from the reactive trajectories, and the locally linear embedding is better for the classification of non-reactive trajectories, and both of them facilitate quantitative analysis. With the help of trajectory analysis, the competition between the two H-atom abstraction reactions can be attributed to two different capture paths.","Shi, Weiliang; Jia, Tian; Li, Anyang",,,646

The main aim is to create a model based on the real data and then to find out the suitable number of other staff (medics) helping a doctor during the process to decrease the number of unattended patients and their waiting times. © ECMS Khalid Al-Begain, Mauro Iacono, Lelio Campanile, Andrzej Bargiela (Editors)","Kuncová, M.; Svitková, K.; Vacková, A.; Vaňková, M.","35th ECMS International Conference on Modelling and Simulation, ECMS 2021",,646
347737,Coronavirus disease-19 in environmental fields: a bibliometric and visualization mapping analysis,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses have unusually large RNA genomes replicated by a multiprotein complex containing an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Exonuclease activity enables the RdRp complex to remove wrongly incorporated bases via proofreading, a process not utilized by other RNA viruses. However, it is unclear why the RdRp complex needs proofreading and what the associated trade-offs are. Here we investigate the interplay among the accuracy, speed, and energetic cost of proofreading in the RdRp complex using a kinetic model and bioinformatics analysis. We find that proofreading nearly optimizes the rate of functional virus production. However, we find that further optimization would lead to a significant increase in the proofreading cost. Unexpected importance of the cost minimization is further supported by other global analyses. We speculate that cost optimization could help avoid cell defense responses. Thus, proofreading is essential for the production of functional viruses, but its rate is limited by energy costs.","Mallory, Joel D; Mallory, Xian F; Kolomeisky, Anatoly B; Igoshin, Oleg A",J Phys Chem Lett,,646

351638,Parents’ Perceptions of Their Children’s Experiences With Distance Learning During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"COVID-19 is a growing issue in society and there is a need for resources to manage the disease. This paper looks at studying the effect of class decomposition in our previously proposed deep convolutional neural network, called DeTraC (Decompose, Transfer and Compose). DeTraC can robustly detect and predict COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The experimental results showed that changing the number of clusters (decomposition granularity) affected the performance of DeTraC and influenced the accuracy of the model. As the number of clusters increased, the accuracy decreased for the shallow tuning mode but increased for the deep tuning mode. This shows the importance of using suitable hyperparameter settings to get the best results from the DeTraC deep learning model. The highest accuracy obtained, in this study, was 98.33% from the deep tuning model. © ECMS Khalid Al-Begain, Mauro Iacono, Lelio Campanile, Andrzej Bargiela (Editors)","Mugova, N. P.; Abdelsamea, M.

352047,"Communication education in K-12: yes, still a concern for higher education",2020,"BACKGROUND: Emergency risk communication is a critical component in emergency planning and response. It has been recognised as significant for planning for and responding to public health emergencies. While there is a growing body of guidelines and frameworks on emergency risk communication, it remains a relatively new field. There has also been limited attention on how emergency risk communication is being performed in public health organisations, such as acute hospitals, and what the associated challenges are. This article seeks to examine the perception of crisis and emergency risk communication in an acute hospital in response to COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore and to identify its associated enablers and barriers. METHODS: A 13-item Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) Survey, based on the US Centers for Disease and Control (CDC) CERC framework, was developed and administered to hospital staff during February 24-28, 2020. The survey also included an open-ended question to solicit feedback on areas of CERC in need of improvement. Chi-square test was used for analysis of survey data. Thematic analysis was performed on qualitative feedback. RESULTS: Of the 1154 participants who responded to the survey, most (94.1%) reported that regular hospital updates on COVID-19 were understandable and actionable. Many (92.5%) stated that accurate, concise and timely information helped to keep them safe. A majority (92.3%) of them were clear about the hospital's response to the COVID-19 situation, and 79.4% of the respondents reported that the hospital had been able to understand their challenges and address their concerns. Sociodemographic characteristics, such as occupation, age, marital status, work experience, gender, and staff's primary work location influenced the responses to hospital CERC. Local leaders within the hospital would need support to better communicate and translate hospital updates in response to COVID-19 to actionable plans for their staff. Better communication in executing resource utilization plans, expressing more empathy and care for their staff, and enhancing communication channels, such as through the use of secure text messaging rather than emails would be important. CONCLUSION: CERC is relevant and important in the hospital setting to managing COVID-19 and should be considered concurrently with hospital emergency response domains.","Ow Yong, Lai Meng; Xin, Xiaohui; Wee, Jennifer Mei Ling; Poopalalingam, Ruban; Kwek, Kenneth Yung Chiang; Thumboo, Julian",BMC Public Health,,646

Methods We analyzed data from the Healthy Minds Study (N=15935;conducted between September and December 2020), which was administered online to students attending one of 28 universities in the United States. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined the associations between COVID-19 infection/severity and 12-month psychotic experiences, adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and international student status, as well as anxiety and depression. Results Over a fifth of the analytic sample reported COVID-19 infection, and around one in six people with COVID-19 infection reported psychotic experiences over the past 12 months. In multivariable logistic regression models, COVID-19 infection was associated with significantly greater odds of having psychotic experiences (aOR: 1.36;95% CI: 1.19-1.48). When compared with being asymptomatic, having moderate (aOR: 1.85;95% CI: 1.03 – 3.31) and severe (aOR: 1.76;95% CI: 1.11 – 2.77) symptoms were associated with significantly greater odds of having psychotic experiences. In weighted models, these associations became statistically non-significant when adjusting for depression and anxiety. Hospitalization was not significantly associated with psychotic experiences among those with COVID-19 infection. Conclusions Psychotic experiences are associated with COVID-19 infections, though much of the association is attenuated when taking into account anxiety and depression. Findings based on this sample of university students should be replicated outside of the university context to determine whether psychosis is a neuropsychiatric symptom during and after COVID-19 infection.","Oh, Hans Schiffman Jason Marsh Jonathan Zhou Sasha Koyanagi Ai DeVylder Jordan",Biological Psychiatry Global Open Science,,646

354199,Descriptive review of positive and negative antecedent social loafing during pandemic covid-19,2021,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the causative agent for a series of atypical respiratory diseases in the Hubei Province of Wuhan, China in December of 2019. The disease SARS-CoV-2, termed COVID-19, was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome surrounded by an extracellular membrane containing a series of spike glycoproteins resembling a crown. COVID-19 infection results in diverse symptoms and morbidity depending on individual genetics, ethnicity, age, and geographic location. In severe cases, COVID-19 pathophysiology includes destruction of lung epithelial cells, thrombosis, hypercoagulation, and vascular leak leading to sepsis. These events lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis in patients. COVID-19 risk factors include cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes, which are highly prevalent in the United States. This population has upregulation of the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, which is exploited by COVID-19 as the route of entry and infection. Viral envelope proteins bind to and degrade ACE2 receptors, thus preventing normal ACE2 function. COVID-19 infection causes imbalances in ACE2 and induces an inflammatory immune response, known as a cytokine storm, both of which amplify comorbidities within the host. Herein, we discuss the genetics, pathogenesis, and possible therapeutics of COVID-19 infection along with secondary complications associated with disease progression, including ARDS and pulmonary fibrosis. Understanding the mechanisms of COVID-19 infection will allow the development of vaccines or other novel therapeutic approaches to prevent transmission or reduce the severity of infection.","Pollard, Casey A; Morran, Michael P; Nestor-Kalinoski, Andrea L",Physiol Genomics,,646

Few existing models have the potential to be extensively used by healthcare providers in low-resource settings since many require laboratory and imaging predictors. Therefore, we sought to develop and validate a multivariable prediction model of death in Mexican patients with COVID-19, by using demographic and patient history predictors. We conducted a national retrospective cohort study in two different sets of patients from the Mexican COVID-19 Epidemiologic Surveillance Study. Patients with a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and complete unduplicated data were eligible. In total, 83 779 patients were included to develop the scoring system through a multivariable Cox regression model; 100 000, to validate the model. Eight predictors (age, sex, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, immunosuppression, hypertension, obesity and chronic kidney disease) were included in the scoring system called PH-Covid19 (range of values: -2 to 25 points). The predictive model has a discrimination of death of 0.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.796-0.804). The PH-Covid19 scoring system was developed and validated in Mexican patients to aid clinicians to stratify patients with COVID-19 at risk of fatal outcomes, allowing for better and efficient use of resources.","Mancilla-Galindo, J; Vera-Zertuche, J M; Navarro-Cruz, A R; Segura-Badilla, O; Reyes-Velázquez, G; Tepepa-López, F J; Aguilar-Alonso, P; Vidal-Mayo, J de J; Kammar-García, A",Epidemiol Infect,,646

As well as characteristics of area populations, such as health status and ethnic mix, it is important to assess the role of more specifically environmental variables (e.g., air quality, green space access). The analysis of this study focuses on neighborhood mortality variations during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in England against a range of postulated area risk factors, both socio-demographic and environmental. We assess mortality gradients across levels of each risk factor and use regression methods to control for multicollinearity and spatially correlated unobserved risks. An analysis of spatial clustering is based on relative mortality risks estimated from the regression. We find mortality gradients in most risk factors showing appreciable differences in COVID mortality risk between English neighborhoods. A regression analysis shows that after allowing for health deprivation, ethnic mix, and ethnic segregation, environment (especially air quality) is an important influence on COVID mortality. Hence, environmental influences on COVID mortality risk in the UK first wave are substantial, after allowing for socio-demographic factors. Spatial clustering of high mortality shows a pronounced metropolitan-rural contrast, reflecting especially ethnic composition and air quality.","Congdon, Peter",J,,646

Higher levels of serum SP-D have been reported in the patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Studies have suggested the ability of human SP-D to recognise spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV; its interaction with HCoV-229E strain leads to viral inhibition in human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells. Previous studies have reported that a recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) composed of 8 Gly-X-Y repeats, neck and CRD region, can act against a range of viral pathogens including influenza A Virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo. In this context, this study was aimed at examining the likely protective role of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2 infection. rfhSP-D showed a dose-responsive binding to S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor binding domain. Importantly, rfhSP-D inhibited interaction of S1 protein with the HEK293T cells overexpressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The protective role of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2 infection as an entry inhibitor was further validated by the use of pseudotyped lentiviral particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein; ~0.5 RLU fold reduction in viral entry was seen following treatment with rfhSP-D (10 µg/ml). These results highlight the therapeutic potential of rfhSP-D in SARS-CoV-2 infection and merit pre-clinical studies in animal models.","Hsieh, Miao-Hsi; Beirag, Nazar; Murugaiah, Valarmathy; Chou, Yu-Chi; Kuo, Wen-Shuo; Kao, Hui-Fang; Madan, Taruna; Kishore, Uday; Wang, Jiu-Yao",Front Immunol,,646

To achieve this, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) have successfully adopted various operational, technological, and air traffic management/infrastructural measures. However, they have also implemented market-based regulatory measures, including the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Additionally, regional measures, such as the European emission trading system (ETS), nationwide political measures, such as flight taxes, and compensation programs by airlines also exist. Therefore, this study surveyed the impact of such measures, primarily on business travelers and their behavior, with a focus on Switzerland. Additionally, not only the impact of the first-last mile (airport access) was discussed, but also intermodal aspects like high-speed rails were debated. Results indicated that flight tax programs were found to have a weak impact on demand. The impact of COVID-19 was addressed and decreased travel frequency from COVID-19 may impact global flight emissions in the long term. Furthermore, passengers supported investments of flight-tax revenues in sustainable aviation technology;they did not support flight contingents. Conclusions are that taxes might generate additional airport traffic. An analysis about booking behaviors revealed fundamental differences in environmental terms.

Of 190 emergency consultations, 186 (97.9%) showed swelling, pain, and trauma with or without systemic symptoms. Among 284 non-emergency consultations, retained primary teeth (n = 126) and orthodontic consultation (n = 53) were the most common reasons for consultation. CONCLUSION: The paediatric emergency and non-emergency problems should be clearly distinguished and sufficient instructions provided in the special period of COVID-19. Priorities also should be set to deal with urgent conditions after the release of lockdown.","Yang, Fengjiao; Yu, Lintong; Qin, Danchen; Hua, Fang; Song, Guangtai",Int. j. paediatr. dent,,646

MATERIALS/METHODS: Retrospective, single-centre study including patients with COVID-19 or FLU pneumonia admitted to the Intensive care Unit (ICU) of Policlinico Umberto I (Rome). Aims were: (1) to assess clinical features and differences of patients with COVID-19 and FLU, (2) to identify clinical and/or laboratory factors associated with FLU or COVID-19 and (3) to evaluate 30-day mortality, bacterial superinfections, thrombotic events and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in patients with FLU versus COVID-19. RESULTS: Overall, 74 patients were included (19, 25.7%, FLU and 55, 74.3%, COVID-19), median age 67 years (58-76). COVID-19 patients were more male (p = 0.013), with a lower percentage of COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (p = 0.001 and p = 0.037, respectively) than FLU. SOFA score was higher (p = 0.020) and lymphocytes were significantly lower in FLU than in COVID-19 [395.5 vs 770.0 cells/mmc, p = 0.005]. At multivariable analysis, male sex (OR 6.1, p < 0.002), age > 65 years (OR 2.4, p = 0.024) and lymphocyte count > 725 cells/mmc at ICU admission (OR 5.1, p = 0.024) were significantly associated with COVID-19, whereas CKD and COPD were associated with FLU (OR 0.1 and OR 0.16, p = 0.020 and p < 0.001, respectively). No differences in mortality, bacterial superinfections and thrombotic events were observed, whereas IPA was mostly associated with FLU (31.5% vs 3.6%, p = 0.0029). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients, male sex, age > 65 years and lymphocytes > 725 cells/mmc are related to COVID-19.

Simultaneous systemic treatment for both diseases,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Liver chemistry abnormalities (LCA) are common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but their causes and clinical impact have not been adequately studied. We assessed the associations between LCA and clinical characteristics, inflammatory serum markers, in-hospital mortality. METHODS: Ten thousand eight hundred fifty-six adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in 13 hospitals in New York (1 March to 27 April 2020) were analyzed retrospectively. Abnormalities of liver chemistries [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin] were defined as absent, mild-moderate (at least one value up to four times elevated), or severe. RESULTS: LCA were mild-moderate in 63.9% and severe in 7.6% at admission. Risk factors for severe LCA were male sex and chronic liver disease. Conversely, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were less likely associated with severe LCA. AST elevation correlated weakly to modestly with inflammatory markers. On adjusted analysis, in-hospital mortality was 1.56 times and 1.87 times increased in patients with mild-to-moderate and severe LCA, respectively. Diabetes, hypertension, male sex, and age greater than 60 years was associated with incremental risk of mortality with increase severity of LCA, especially in the first week of hospitalization. HTN was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality unless LCA was present. CONCLUSION: Increasing severity of LCA on hospital admission predicts early in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Mortality associated with the known risk factors, hypertension, diabetes, male sex, and old age was accentuated in the presence of LCA. AST correlated modestly with inflammatory markers.","Satapathy, Sanjaya K; Kuntzen, Christian; Qiu, He; Jiang, Yu; Bodenheimer, Henry C; Roth, Nitzan C; Lee, Tai-Ping; Hirsch, Jamie S; Trindade, Arvind J; Bernstein, David E",Eur. j. gastroenterol. hepatol,,646

Hence, local outlier analysis and emerging spatiotemporal hot spot analysis were performed to analyze the spatiotemporal clustering pattern and cold/hot spot trends of COVID-19 cases based on space-time cube during the period from 23 January 2020 to 24 February 2020. The main findings are as follows: (1) The outbreak had spread rapidly throughout the country within a short time and the current totality incidence rate has decreased. (2) The spatiotemporal distribution of cases was uneven. In terms of the spatiotemporal clustering pattern, Wuhan and Shiyan city were the center as both cities had high-high clustering pattern with a surrounding unstable multiple-type pattern in partial areas of Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces, and Chongqing city. Those regions are continuously in the hot spot on the spatiotemporal tendency. (3) The spatiotemporal analysis technology based on the space-time cube can analyze comprehensively the spatiotemporal pattern of epidemiological data and produce a visual output of the consequences, which can reflect intuitively the distribution and trend of data in space-time.

This paper will focus on an Android App that will measure the Heart Rate and Oxygen Saturation (also known as SPO2) of COVID-19 patients and the general public using photoplethysmography and IOT. The edge provided by our proposed model is the wide availability of a large range of sensors and microcontrollers and it's relatively low cost as compared to the current architecture being used. Another advantage of our approach is generation of data that can be used for further understanding and research. The app will then be upgraded to connect to multiple sensor devices connected to the same microcontroller module and receive data from those, hence creating a fully functional interface for complete health monitoring of patients as well as the general public at a minimal cost. © 2021 IEEE.","Chauhan, A.; Farmah, K.; Goel, A.; Gandotra, A.","5th International Conference on Computing Methodologies and Communication, ICCMC 2021",,646
366844,COVID-19 Impact on the Future of Hospitality and Travel,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of life of Latin American orthopedic trauma surgeons during the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America. METHODS: A total of 400 orthopedic trauma surgeons from 14 Latin American countries were invited to complete an electronic survey aiming to understand the general situation of COVID-19 in each country and how COVID-19 had impacted life's participant financially and psychosocially. The relationship between the occurrence of the disease and the existence of legal regulations on the medical activity in the respondent's country, protocols for tracking the disease among patients hospitalized in an emergency basis due to skeletal trauma, and personal protective equipment to deal with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who need orthopedic trauma surgery was investigated, as well as the financial and psychosocial impact caused by the disease. Data was statistically analyzed with significance p < 0.05. RESULTS: 220 respondents completed the survey. 21 respondents were diagnosed with COVID-19. Local regulation was decisive in terms of increasing the risk for COVID-19 disease (p = 0.001). 91.8% of the respondents reported being concerned about their financial health and 57.7% described a state of feeling emotionally overextended. 75.0% believe that pandemic can change their professional activity. CONCLUSION: The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America has negatively impacted the professional, financial, and psychosocial health of orthopedic trauma surgeons. It seems reasonable to state that the combination of psychosocial distress and deprivation together with financial uncertainty and decreased revenue can be straightly related to development of burnout symptoms among doctors.","Giordano, Vincenzo; Belangero, William; Godoy-Santos, Alexandre Leme; Pires, Robinson Esteves; Xicará, José Arturo; Labronici, Pedro",Injury,,646
366979,"A Wake-Up Call: Equity, Inequality and Covid-19 Emergency Remote Teaching and Learning",2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought a new wave of challenges to health care, particularly in the area of rapid diagnostic test development and implementation. Acute diagnosis of COVID-19 infection is critically dependent on detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from clinical specimens (e.g. nasopharyngeal swabs). While laboratory-developed testing for SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of diagnostic testing for this virus, the majority of clinical microbiology laboratories are dependent on commercially available SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays. In contrast to assays approved or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for in vitro diagnostic use, assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids have Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA. Outside of highly specialized academic and commercial laboratory settings, clinical microbiology laboratories are likely unfamiliar with EUA classification and thus assay verification can be daunting. Further compounding anxiety for laboratories are major issues with supply chain that are dramatically affecting the availability of test reagents and requiring laboratories to implement multiple commercial EUA tests. Here, we describe guidance for the verification of assays with EUA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from clinical specimens.","Mitchell, Stephanie L; St George, Kirsten; Rhoads, Daniel D; Butler-Wu, Susan M; Dharmarha, Vaishali; McNult, Peggy; Miller, Melissa B",J. clin. microbiol,,646

Alternative methods to reach these people have become necessary. We assessed the feasibility, satisfaction, and effectiveness of video teleconsultation using mobile phones for managing persons with epilepsy (PWEs) on follow-up at a tertiary care center in the southern part of India. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included PWEs aged 18â¯years and over who have been evaluated in person within the past six months, with details available in electronic health records (EHRs), and advised regular follow-up after getting telephonic consent. We excluded those requiring emergency care and those seeking teleconsultation for new symptoms. Participants were sent a message in English and in the local language about the possibility of a video teleconsultation. If willing, they were informed about the date, time, and technical requirements such as smartphones, browsing facilities, etc. Feasibility and effectiveness were assessed. Satisfaction/acceptability was assessed using Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire. RESULTS: From June 2020 to October 2020, we selected 336 PWEs after screening 1100 records, and we tried video teleconsultation in 141 (41.8%) PWEs. We achieved successful video connections in 95 (28.2%) and audio consultations in 46 (13.6%). The median duration for calling the participants, making successful connections, and consultation was 8 (5-14) min. The majority required two (47.4%) or three (32.6%) attempts. Sixty-five PWEs (68.4%) used caretaker's mobile phones. We gave prescriptions to all, and 18 received new drugs. Out of 95 PWEs, 90% either 'agreed' or 'strongly agreed' on 12 out of 14 telemedicine satisfaction questions. CONCLUSION: Although we need to make video teleconsultation more feasible, our synchronous mobile video teleconsultation model is an effective and acceptable method to follow up PWEs. This real-time model has the advantage that it does not require any mobile application to be downloaded and installed. Further studies are needed to evaluate methods to improve the reach of these services particularly to vulnerable groups of the population.","Nair, Pradeep Pankajakshan; Aghoram, Rajeswari; Thomas, Bitty; Bharadwaj, Balaji; Chinnakali, Palanivel",Epilepsy Behav,,646

Traffic flows on the roads is a critical condition for these services and, therefore, it is of paramount importance to forecast how they will evolve over time. By knowing future events (such as, traffic jams), vehicular services can be dimensioned in an on-demand fashion in order to minimize Service Level Agreements (SLAs) violations, thus reducing the chances of car accidents. This research departs from an evaluation of traditional time-series techniques with recent Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions to forecast traffic flows in the roads of Torino (Italy). Given the accuracy of the selected forecasting techniques, a forecast-based scaling algorithm is proposed and evaluated over a set of dimensioning experiments of three distinct vehicular services with strict latency requirements. Results show that the proposed scaling algorithm enables resource savings of up to a 5% at the cost of incurring in an increase of less than 0.4% of latency violations.","Mart'in-P'erez, Jorge; Kondepu, Koteswararao; Vleeschauwer, Danny De; Reddy, Venkatarami; Guimaraes, Carlos; Sgambelluri, Andrea; Valcarenghi, Luca; Papagianni, Chrysa; Bernardos, Carlos J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12527v1.pdf,646

Additionally, some studies require the analysis of pro-allergic and inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, LTC4, and various basophil-derived cytokines (e.g., IL-4 and IL-13). Elucidation of intracellular signaling proteins by Western blotting, cytosolic free calcium concentration by spectrofluorophotometry, and detection of mediator releases, as well as analysis of gene expressions by RT-PCR, generally requires relatively large numbers of purified basophils. In selected assays, flow cytometry enables the analysis of relatively low cell numbers and purity for the expression of intracellular signaling proteins or measurement of cytosolic free calcium concentrations by basophil-specific gating strategies. Unfortunately, many aspects of signal transduction relevant to human basophils cannot be readily extrapolated from the use of basophil or mast cell lines. This chapter therefore focuses on how to employ primary human basophils for studying mediator releases and signaling characteristics.","Knol, Edward F; Gibbs, Bernhard F",Methods Mol Biol,,646

379290,Forced homeward: the COVID-19 implications for housing,2021,"Anatomy education provides students with opportunities to learn structure and function of the human body, to acquire professional competencies such as teamwork, interpersonal skills, self-awareness, and to reflect on and practice medical ethics. The fulfillment of this wide potential can present challenges in courses that are part of an integrated curriculum and shorter than traditional courses. This new reality, together with students' increasing concern about the stresses within medical education, led to efforts at Harvard Medical School to implement practical steps toward an optimal learning environment in anatomy. These were based on core elements of ethical anatomy education and principles of trauma-informed care. Anatomy is conceptualized here as the ""first clinical discipline,"" with relational interactions between anatomical educators, medical students, and body donors/patients. Essential prerequisites for the implementation of this work were support by the medical school leadership, open partnership between engaged students and faculty, faculty coordination, and peer-teaching. Specific interventions included pre-course faculty development on course philosophy and invitations to students to share their thoughts on anatomy. Student responses were integrated in course introductions, combined with a pre-dissection laboratory visit, an introductory guide, and a module on the history and ethics of anatomy. During the course, team-building activities were scheduled, and self-reflection encouraged, for example, through written exercises, and elective life-body drawing. Students' responses to the interventions were overall positive, but need further evaluation. This first attempt of a systematic implementation of an optimal learning environment in anatomy led to the identification of areas in need of adjustment.","McDaniel, Katherine G; Brown, Taylor; Radford, Caitlin C; McDermott, Cynthia H; van Houten, Trudy; Katz, Martha E; Stearns, Dana A; Hildebrandt, Sabine",,,646

Methods: A retrospective analysis of the first chest HRCT images of 106 patients with COVID-19 was performed who were confirmed in our hospital from January 3 to 25, 2020. Lesion distribution, morphology and surrounding involvement were analyzed. Results: The lesions were found on all initial HRCT images of 106 patients, with unilateral lung distribution in 11 cases (10.4%) and bilateral lung distribution in other 95 cases(89.6%), peripheral distribution of lung in 65 cases (61.3%) and peripheral and central distribution in other 41 cases (38.7%). HRCT showed 8 cases (7.5%) with 1 lesion, 5 cases (4.7%) with 2 lesions, and other 93 cases (87.8%) with multiple lesions. HRCT also showed the nodular lesions in 12 cases(11.3%), ground-glass opacities in 94 cases (88.7%), fibrous stripes in 7 cases (6.6%), and mixed lesions in 15 cases (14.2%). Only one lung lobe was involved in 10 cases (9.4%), while more than two lobes were involved in other 96 cases (90.6%). In addition, 24 cases (22.6%) with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes (over 60 years old in 19 cases, accounting for 79.2%), 3 cases with pleural effusion (2.8 %), 1 case with pericardial effusion (0.9%), and 2 cases with pleural involvement/thickening (1.9%) were found. Patients over 60 years old mostly presented with multiple lesions, various appearances, peripheral and central distributions of lungs, involving multiple lobes, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Conclusions: Lung COVID-19 lesions can be shown by the initial chest HRCT, which is the preferred imaging method. Thoracic HRCT scans play an important role in the early diagnosis of COVID-19.","Liu, Haifeng; Zhang, Dongyou; Yang, Yi; Long, Bin; Yin, Long; Zhao, Ming; Peng, Yong",Chin. J. Radiol.,,646

Social media are important information dissemination platforms that can augment traditional channels communicating public health recommendations. The objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 public health messaging on Twitter when delivered by emergency physicians and containing personal narratives. METHODS: On April 30, 2020, we randomly assigned 2007 U.S. adults to an online survey using a 2x2 factorial design. Participants rated 1 of 4 simulated Twitter posts varied by messenger type (emergency physician vs federal official) and content (personal narrative vs impersonal guidance). Main outcomes were: perceived message effectiveness (35-point scale); perceived attitude effectiveness (15-point scale); likelihood to share Tweets (7-point scale); and writing a letter to their governor to continue COVID-19 restrictions (write letter or none). RESULTS: The physician/personal message had the strongest effect and significantly improved all main messaging outcomes except for letter-writing. Unadjusted mean differences between physician/personal and federal/impersonal were: perceived messaging effectiveness (3.2 [95%CI, 2.4-4.0]); perceived attitude effectiveness (1.3 [95%CI, 0.8-1.7]); likelihood to share (0.4 [95%CI, 0.15-0.7]). For letter-writing, physician/ personal made no significant impact compared to federal/ impersonal (odds ratio 1.14 [95%CI, 0.89-1.46]). CONCLUSIONS: Emergency physicians sharing personal narratives on Twitter are perceived to be more effective at communicating COVID-19 health recommendations compared to federal officials sharing impersonal guidance.","Solnick, Rachel E; Chao, Grace; Ross, Ryan; Kraft-Todd, Gordon T; Kocher, Keith E",Acad. emerg. med,,646
382614,Labour Migrants During the Pandemic: A Comparative Perspective,2020,"Dark markets are commercial websites that use Bitcoin to sell or broker transactions involving drugs, weapons, and other illicit goods. Being illegal, they do not offer any user protection, and several police raids and scams have caused large losses to both customers and vendors over the past years. However, this uncertainty has not prevented a steady growth of the dark market phenomenon and a proliferation of new markets. The origin of this resilience have remained unclear so far, also due to the difficulty of identifying relevant Bitcoin transaction data. Here, we investigate how the dark market ecosystem re-organises following the disappearance of a market, due to factors including raids and scams. To do so, we analyse 24 episodes of unexpected market closure through a novel datasets of 133 million Bitcoin transactions involving 31 dark markets and their users, totalling 4 billion USD. We show that coordinated user migration from the closed market to coexisting markets guarantees overall systemic resilience beyond the intrinsic fragility of individual markets. The migration is swift, efficient and common to all market closures. We find that migrants are on average more active users in comparison to non-migrants and move preferentially towards the coexisting market with the highest trading volume. Our findings shed light on the resilience of the dark market ecosystem and we anticipate that they may inform future research on the self-organisation of emerging online markets.","ElBahrawy, Abeer; Alessandretti, Laura; Rusnac, Leonid; Goldsmith, Daniel; Teytelboym, Alexander; Baronchelli, Andrea",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09536v1.pdf,646

383468,Is It Time for a Revolution in Work‒Life Balance? Reflections from Spain,2020,"Introduction: The purpose of this study was to examine the use of telemedicine at one academic health care center during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify opportunities to improve access to this novel delivery method of care. Methods: All patients who underwent telemedicine visits at one urban academic medical center between March 2020 and June 2020 were included. All departments were included including surgical and nonsurgical. Demographic data, primary language, and visit type were collected. Primary zip code was used as surrogate for socioeconomic status through use of the zip code median household income. The demographics of the New York metropolitan area were obtained through the U.S. Census Bureau and used as a control cohort. Results: A total of 362,413 telemedicine visits met inclusion criteria with the majority of visits performed in April and May; 127,851 (35.3%) and 110,166 (30.4%), respectively. The highest performing department was Internal Medicine, which performed 72,796 visits or 20% of the total cohort. In our cohort of telemedicine patients, 59.6% identified as White, 11.4% as Black, and 5.7% as Asian. This is less diverse than the overall population of the metropolitan area, which is 17.5% Black and 11.5% Asian. There was also a large gender gap in the utilization of telemedicine services in general, where women (60.2%) were more likely than men (39.8%) to utilize the virtual visits. In addition, although over a third of patients in the Metropolitan area have median household incomes of <50,000, this population only represented 13.6% of our total cohort. Conclusions: This study highlights both the capability of telemedicine to provide care at a large urban academic medical center during a pandemic in addition to identifying potential gaps in care with telemedicine. The disparities highlighted in our cohort stress the importance of outreach to non-White older patients of lower socioeconomic status.","Lott, Ariana; Campbell, Kirk A; Hutzler, Lorraine; Lajam, Claudette M",Telemed. j. e. health,,646

The number of new cases reported nationally this fortnight was 1,751, a 61% decrease from the previous fortnight (4,501). On average this represented 125 cases diagnosed each day over the reporting period, a decrease from 322 cases per day over the previous reporting period. 94% (1,640) of all cases were reported in Victoria, with a smaller number of cases reported from New South Wales (86), Queensland (19), Western Australia (5) and South Australia (1). In Victoria, the majority of cases (1,528; 93%) were locally acquired, with a further 112 (7%) under investigation at the time of analysis, but likely also to be locally acquired. Of the remaining 111 cases reported, 22 (20%) were overseas acquired; 82 (74%) were locally acquired, predominantly in NSW, and 7 (6%) were reported as under investigation. The continued decrease in new cases observed this fortnight in Victoria is likely associated with the enhanced public health measures that are currently in place in Victoria. Locally acquired cases which were predominantly associated with several interconnected clusters continued to be reported in NSW. In Qld a cluster of cases associated with a youth detention centre was identified. A total of 26 deaths were reported from cases diagnosed in this reporting period, all from Victoria and aged 75 years or older.

COVID-19 has spread rapidly and is now considered a global pandemic. We present a case of a patient with minimal respiratory symptoms but prominent bilateral groundglass opacities in a 'crazy paving' pattern on chest CT imaging and a negative initial infectious workup. However, given persistent dyspnoea and labs suggestive of COVID-19 infection, the patient remained hospitalised for further monitoring. Forty-eight hours after initial testing, the PCR test was repeated and returned positive for COVID-19. This case illustrates the importance of clinical vigilance to retest patients for COVID-19, particularly in the absence of another compelling aetiology. As COVID-19 testing improves to rapidly generate results, selective retesting of patients may uncover additional COVID-19 cases and strengthen measures to minimise the spread of COVID-19.","Samec, Matthew J; Khawaja, Ali; Patel, Ashokakumar M; Dugani, Sagar B",BMJ case reports,,646

RTI Press Publication OP-0069-2105,2021,"Background and Objectives: The aims of this systematic review were to identify additional infection control measures implemented in dental practice globally to prevent cross-infection and evaluate the psychological impacts of the pandemic among dental professionals. Materials and Methods: A sequential systematic literature search was conducted from December 2019 to 30 April 2020 through PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded the following results: ""COVID-19"" (n = 12,137), ""Novel corona virus"" (n = 63), ""COVID-19 and dentistry"" (n = 46), ""COVID-19 and oral health"" (n = 41), ""Novel Corona virus and Dentistry"" (n = 0), ""dental health and Novel Coronavirus"" (n = 26), and ""dental practice and Novel Coronavirus"" (n = 6). Results: After a careful review and eliminating articles based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, the final review included 13 articles. Management of infection control is discussed extensively in the literature and remains the main theme of many Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) articles on dentistry. Telephone triage using a questionnaire, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE) for clinical and nonclinical staff, a preprocedural mouth rinse, and aerosol management have been discussed and implemented in few countries. Three studies recommended that elective treatments for patients with a temperature of >100.4 F or 38 °C should be postponed or performed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) or negative-pressure room. Limiting the number of patients in the waiting area, the removal of shared objects, proper ventilation, and physical distancing were highly recommended. Psychological distress among dental professionals in relation to existing medical conditions and self-efficacy has been discussed. Conclusions: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the dental profession worldwide, our review highlights many practice management approaches to adopt the new norm. More research highlighting evidence-based safety practices and multisectoral collaboration is required to help dental professionals make informed decisions and make the profession safe, both for the patient and dental professionals.","Mahdi, Syed Sarosh; Ahmed, Zohaib; Allana, Raheel; Peretti, Alessandro; Amenta, Francesco; Nadeem Bijle, Mohammed; Seow, Liang Lin; Daood, Umer",Medicina (Kaunas),,646

391114,Covid-19 and crispr test,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) is an acute respiratory illness, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus2 (SARS-COV2) which quickly grew to a pandemic in late 2019 and led to substantial public health problems. Among the extrapulmonary manifestations reported, cardiovascular implications are remarkable as they can be potentially lethal. There have been rare reports of pericardial involvement, despite the pronounced cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock and venous thromboembolism. Herein, we reported a young man with cardiac tamponade as the presenting feature of COVID-19. Case summary: An otherwise healthy 28-year-old man, was admitted with pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath and was diagnosed with COVID-19 associated cardiac tamponade. Emergency pericardiocentesis yielded large amount of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion which resulted in symptom relief. He was successfully treated with pericardiocentesis followed by anti-viral and anti-inflammatory medications and remained asymptomatic in 1-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: We highlight this case to mention that ""hemorrhagic"" cardiac tamponade can be a life-threatening complication of COVID-19, which can be treated if diagnosed early. Therefore, clinicians should be fully aware of this cardiac complication to consider in deteriorating COVID-19 patients.","Heidari, Amir; Hashemi, S Enssieh; Parsa Mahjoob, Mohammad; Jadbabaei, Amir Nasser",Acta Biomed,,646

METHODS: Subjects included postpartum women under the age of 45 that were registered at the C Cultural Women’s Center in Bun-dang, Gyeonggi-do. All subjects were within 1 year of childbirth, had no medical opinion and were not receiving medication. A total of 16 people were enrolled in this experiment, which consisted of a Pilates Exercise group (EX, n=8) and a control group (CON, n=8). Measurements of body composition, abdominal subcutaneous fat thickness and circumference, pelvic tilt, pelvic strength, and back pain index were all assessed prior to being exposed to experimental measures. After 8 weeks of un-tact home Pilates exercise, a follow-up examination was conducted to observe the group-specific changes. RESULTS: The group that participated in the un-tact home Pilates exercise showed a decrease in body fat, BMI, and visceral fat postpar-tum. Abdominal obesity tests showed a significant reduction in subcutaneous fat thickness, abdominal and hip circumference. The pelvic tilt test showed a reduction in the pelvic slope of the EX-group. Finally, the Oswestry Disabililty Index test showed the total score of the EX-group had decreased, confirming that Pilates exercise in this study was effective for back pain. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, un-tact home Pilates exercise using a real time web program is an effective intervention that can be used to pre-vent postpartum obesity by reducing abdominal and total body adiposity postpartum, assisting pelvic function, and improving muscle strength while also reducing back pain. © 2021 Korean Society of Exercise Physiology.","Hyun, A.

Haploidentical HSCT is an emerging modality with encouraging outcomes in several blood conditions. The present study aims to comprehensively assess the feasibility and safety of haploidentical HSCT in patients with severe and very severe AA. It is a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies related to haploidentical stem cell transplantation in idiopathic AA investigating rates of successful engraftment, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), chronic GvHD (cGvHD), transplant-related mortality (TRM), and posttransplantation viral infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV]) in patients with AA. The effects of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and nonmyeloablative conditioning (NMA), as well as various GvHD prophylaxis regimens on these outcomes were evaluated. In total 15 studies were identified, (577 patients, 58.9% males), successful engraftment was observed in 97.3% of patients (95% CI, 95.9-98.7) while grades II-IV aGvHD and cGvHD were reported in 26.6% and 25.0%, respectively. The pooled incidence of TRM was 6.7% per year (95% CI, 4.0-9.4). RIC regimens were associated with higher proportions of successful engraftment (97.7% vs 91.7%, P = 0.03) and aGvHD (29.5% vs 18.7%, P = 0.008) when compared with NMA regimens with no differences in cGvHD or mortality incidence. When compared with methotrexate-containing regimens and other regimens, posttransplant cyclophosphamide-containing regimens reduced the rates of aGvHD (28.6%, 27.8%, and 12.8%, respectively, P = 0.02), CMV viremia (55.7%, 38.6%, and 10.4%, respectively, P < 0.001), and CMV disease in initially viremic patients (2.1%, 33.0%, and 0%, respectively, P < 0.001). We have concluded that Haploidentical HSCT was associated with promising outcomes in terms of successful engraftment and reduced complications. Future prospective trials are needed to identify the preferred conditioning regimen, GvHD prophylaxis, and graft source in the setting of haploidentical transplant for AA.","ElGohary, Ghada; El Fakih, Riad; de Latour, Regis; Risitano, Antonio; Marsh, Judith; Schrezenmeier, Hubert; Gluckman, Eliane; Höchsmann, Britta; Pierri, Filomena; Halkes, Constantijn; Alzahrani, Hazzaa; De la Fuente, Josu; Cesaro, Simone; Alahmari, Ali; Ahmed, Syed Osman; Passweg, Jakob; Dufour, Carlo; Bacigalupo, Andrea; Aljurf, Mahmoud",Bone marrow transplant,,646

392138,The effect of e-Learning practices during the Covid-19 pandemic on enhancing self-regulated learning skills as perceived by university students,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Mental health conditions like depression and anxiety are on the rise, but access to care remains a challenge. Immigrants and racialized communities including Chinese Canadians experience high level of access barriers including communication with clinicians. With the aim to facilitate mental health communications, we tested an Interactive Computer-assisted Client Assessment Survey (iCCAS) in Cantonese/Mandarin and English at a nurse practitioner-led primary care clinic in Toronto. The iCCAS offers a touch-screen, pre-consultation survey with questions on depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, alcohol abuse, and social context. The program generates point-of-care reports for the clinician and patient. METHODS: A pilot randomized controlled trial examined the intervention impact on mental health discussion and symptom detection, compared with the usual care, followed by clinicians' qualitative interviews. RESULTS: Fifty self-identified Chinese adult patients participated (iCCAS = 26, Usual Care = 24), response rate 79.4%. Participant mean age was 44.8 years and 92% were immigrants. There was an increase of 19% and 15% in the mental health discussion and detection of symptoms in the iCCAS group compared with the usual care. More participants in the iCCAS group were referred to a social worker or psychiatrist. Patients found the use of iCCAS easy and clinicians identified its benefits for themselves (eg, early identification and comfort) and patients (eg, self-awareness and anonymity) and proposed practice-integration. DISCUSSION: The studied tool holds promise for enhancing clinician-patient mental health communications in primary care settings for overseas Chinese. Implications are discussed for in-person and virtual healthcare which could also inform responses to mental health crisis related to COVID-19.","Ahmad, Farah; Wang, Jamie; Wong, Bonnie; Fung, Wai Lun Alan",Asia Pac Psychiatry,,646
392437,[The heart and COVID-19: A first update],2020,"We investigated the clinical course of individuals with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) who were transferred from the Diamond Princess cruise ship to 12 local hospitals. The conditions and clinical courses of patients with pneumonia were compared with those of patients without pneumonia. Among 70 patients (median age: 67 years) analyzed, the major symptoms were fever (64.3%), cough (54.3%), and general fatigue (24.3%). Forty-three patients (61.4%) had pneumonia. Higher body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate as well as higher of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and lower serum albumin level and lymphocyte count were associated with the presence of pneumonia. Ground-glass opacity was found in 97.7% of the patients with pneumonia. Patients were administered neuraminidase inhibitors (20%), lopinavir/ritonavir (32.9%), and ciclesonide inhalation (11.4%). Mechanical ventilation and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed on 14 (20%) and 2 (2.9%) patients, respectively; two patients died. The median duration of intubation was 12 days. The patients with COVID-19 transferred to local hospitals during the outbreak had severe conditions and needed close monitoring. The severity of COVID-19 depends on the presence of pneumonia. High serum LDH, AST and CRP levels and low serum albumin level and lymphocyte count were found to be predictors of pneumonia. It was challenging for local hospitals to admit and treat these patients during the outbreak of COVID-19. Assessment of severity was crucial to manage a large number of patients.","Kato, Hideaki; Shimizu, Hiroyuki; Shibue, Yasushi; Hosoda, Tomohiro; Iwabuchi, Keisuke; Nagamine, Kotaro; Saito, Hiroki; Sawada, Reimin; Oishi, Takayuki; Tsukiji, Jun; Fujita, Hiroyuki; Furuya, Ryosuke; Masuda, Makoto; Akasaka, Osamu; Ikeda, Yu; Sakamoto, Mitsuo; Sakai, Kazuya; Uchiyama, Munehito; Watanabe, Hiroki; Yamaguchi, Nobuhiro; Higa, Ryoko; Sasaki, Akiko; Tanaka, Katsuaki; Toyoda, Yukitoshi; Hamanaka, Shinsuke; Miyazawa, Naoki; Shimizu, Atsuko; Fukase, Fumie; Iwai, Shunsuke; Komase, Yuko; Kawasaki, Tsutomu; Nagata, Isao; Nakayama, Yusuke; Takei, Tetsuhiro; Kimura, Katsuo; Kunisaki, Reiko; Kudo, Makoto; Takeuchi, Ichiro; Nakajima, Hideaki",J Infect Chemother,,646

392951,POS-720 Atypical Cause of Pancytopenia in a Kidney Transplant Patient,2021,"BACKGROUND: Widespread access to the internet has boosted the emergence of online hospitals. A new outpatient service called ""internet hospital plus drug delivery"" (IHDD) has been developed in China, but little is known about this platform. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics, acceptance, and initial impact of IHDD during the outbreak of COVID-19 in a tertiary hospital in South China. METHODS: The total number of and detailed information on online prescriptions during the first 2 months after work resumption were obtained. Patients' gender, age, residence, associated prescription department, time of prescription, payment, and drug delivery region were included in the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1380 prescriptions were picked up or delivered between March 2 and April 20, 2020. The largest group of patients were 36-59 years old (n=680, 49.3%), followed by the 18-35 years age category (n=573, 41.5%). In total, 39.4% (n=544) of the patients chose to get their medicine by self-pickup, while 60.6% (n=836) preferred to receive their medicine via drug delivery service. The top five online prescription departments were infectious diseases (n=572, 41.4%), nephrology (n=264, 19.1%), endocrinology (n=145, 10.5%), angiocardiopathy (n=107, 7.8%), and neurology (n=42, 3%). Of the 836 delivered prescriptions, 440 (52.6%) were sent to Guangdong Province (including 363 [43.4%] to Shenzhen), and 396 (47.4%) were sent to other provinces in China. CONCLUSIONS: The IHDD platform is efficient and convenient for various types of patients during the COVID-19 crisis. Although offline visits are essential for patients with severe conditions, IHDD can help to relieve pressure on hospitals by reducing an influx of patients with mild symptoms. Further efforts need to be made to improve the quality and acceptance of IHDD, as well as to regulate and standardize the management of this novel service.","Ding, Liang; She, Qiuru; Chen, Fengxian; Chen, Zitong; Jiang, Meifang; Huang, Huasi; Li, Yujin; Liao, Chaofeng",J Med Internet Res,,646
393043,Safeguarding Non-COVID-19 Research: Looking Up from Ground Zero,2020,"Background: Based on our Phantom study on transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), we hypothesized that EEG band power and field confinement would be greater following left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC - F3) tDCS using circular vs. rectangular electrodes. Methods: Double-blind randomized trial comparing tDCS with anode over the left DLPFC (groups: rectangular electrodes, circular electrodes, sham) and 2 active subgroup references (right shoulder vs. right DLPFC cathodes). Results: Twenty-four randomized participants were assessed. We indeed found higher average EEG power spectral density (PSD) across bands for circular vs. rectangular electrodes, largely confined to F3 and there was a significant increase at AF3 for low alpha (p=0.037). Significant differences included: increased PSD in low beta (p=0.024) and theta bands (p=0.021) at F3, and in theta (p=0.036) at FC5 for the right DLPFC vs. shoulder with no coherence changes. We also found PSD differences between active vs. sham tDCS at Fz for alpha (p=0.043), delta (p=0.036), high delta (p=0.030); and at FC1 for alpha (p=0.031), with coherence differences for F3-Fz in beta (p=0.044), theta (p=0.044), delta (p=0.037) and high delta (p=0.009). Conclusion: This pilot study despite having low statistical power given its small sample size shows that active left DLPFC tDCS modulates EEG frontocentrally and suggests that electrode shapes/reference locations affect its neurophysiological effects, such as increased low alpha power at AF3 using circular vs. rectangular electrodes. Further research with more participants is warranted.","El-Hagrassy, Mirret M; Duarte, Dante; Lu, Jerry; Uygur-Kucukseymen, Elif; Munger, Marionna; Thibaut, Aurore; Lv, Pengcheng; Morales-Quezada, Leon; Fregni, Felipe",Expert rev. med. devices,,646

394804,Digital well-being under pandemic conditions: catalysing a theory of online flourishing,2021,"Rhipicephalus microplus is recognized as a tick species highly prevalent in cattle, with a wide pantropical distribution that seems to continue spreading geographically. However, its role as a biological vector has been scarcely studied in the livestock context. In this study, a 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing analysis was used to determine bacterial diversity in salivary glands and gut of R. microplus from two contrasting livestock agroecosystems in Antioquia, Colombia. Both the culture-independent approach (CI) and the culture-dependent (CD) approach were complementarily adopted in this study. A total of 341 unique OTUs were assigned, the richness showed to be higher in the Northern than in the Middle Magdalena region, and a high diversity was found at the phylum and genus levels in the samples obtained. With the CI approach, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were the most common phylum of bacteria regardless of the organ, or geographic origin of the specimens analyzed. While the relative abundance of bacteria at a phylum level with the CD approach varied between analyzed samples, the data obtained suggest that a high diversity of species of bacteria occurs in R. microplus from both livestock agroecosystems. Bacterial genera such as Anaplasma, Coxiella, and Ehrlichia, recognized for their implications in tick-borne diseases, were also detected, together with endosymbionts such as Lysinibacillus, previously reported as a potential tool for biological control. This information is useful to deepen the knowledge about microbial diversity regarding the relations between endosymbionts and pathogens and could facilitate the future development of epidemiological surveillance in livestock systems.","Segura, Juan A; Isaza, Juan P; Botero, Luz E; Alzate, Juan F; Gutiérrez, Lina A",PLoS One,,646

396576,School Closed,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus of the COVID-19 pandemic, that is presently devastating the entire world, had been active well before January of this year, when its pathogenic potential exploded full force in Wuhan. It had caused the onset of small disease outbreaks in China, and probably elsewhere as well, which failed to reach epidemic potential. The distant general origin of its zoonosis can be traced back to the ecosystem changes that have decreased biodiversity, greatly facilitating the contacts between humans and the animal reservoirs that carry pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. These reservoirs are the bats. The transition between the limited outbreaks that had occurred through 2019 and the epidemic explosion of December-January was made possible by the great amplification of the general negative conditions that had caused the preceding small outbreaks. In the light of what we have now learned, the explosion was predictable, and could have happened wherever the conditions that had allowed it, could be duplicated. What could not have been predicted was the second transition, from epidemic to pandemic.

397732,Formation of Professional Competences and Soft Skills of Public Administration Employees for Sustainable Professional Development,2021,"Importance: It has been hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may make patients more susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to worse outcomes through upregulation of the functional receptor of the virus, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Objective: To examine whether use of ACEI/ARBs was associated with COVID-19 diagnosis and worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: To examine outcomes among patients with COVID-19, a retrospective cohort study using data from Danish national administrative registries was conducted. Patients with COVID-19 from February 22 to May 4, 2020, were identified using ICD-10 codes and followed up from day of diagnosis to outcome or end of study period (May 4, 2020). To examine susceptibility to COVID-19, a Cox regression model with a nested case-control framework was used to examine the association between use of ACEI/ARBs vs other antihypertensive drugs and the incidence rate of a COVID-19 diagnosis in a cohort of patients with hypertension from February 1 to May 4, 2020. Exposures: ACEI/ARB use was defined as prescription fillings 6 months prior to the index date. Main Outcomes and Measures: In the retrospective cohort study, the primary outcome was death, and a secondary outcome was a composite outcome of death or severe COVID-19. In the nested case-control susceptibility analysis, the outcome was COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: In the retrospective cohort study, 4480 patients with COVID-19 were included (median age, 54.7 years [interquartile range, 40.9-72.0]; 47.9% men). There were 895 users (20.0%) of ACEI/ARBs and 3585 nonusers (80.0%). In the ACEI/ARB group, 18.1% died within 30 days vs 7.3% in the nonuser group, but this association was not significant after adjustment for age, sex, and medical history (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.67-1.03]). Death or severe COVID-19 occurred in 31.9% of ACEI/ARB users vs 14.2% of nonusers by 30 days (adjusted HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.89-1.23]). In the nested case-control analysis of COVID-19 susceptibility, 571 patients with COVID-19 and prior hypertension (median age, 73.9 years; 54.3% men) were compared with 5710 age- and sex-matched controls with prior hypertension but not COVID-19. Among those with COVID-19, 86.5% used ACEI/ARBs vs 85.4% of controls; ACEI/ARB use compared with other antihypertensive drugs was not significantly associated with higher incidence of COVID-19 (adjusted HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.80-1.36]). Conclusions and Relevance: Prior use of ACEI/ARBs was not significantly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis among patients with hypertension or with mortality or severe disease among patients diagnosed as having COVID-19. These findings do not support discontinuation of ACEI/ARB medications that are clinically indicated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fosbøl, Emil L; Butt, Jawad H; Østergaard, Lauge; Andersson, Charlotte; Selmer, Christian; Kragholm, Kristian; Schou, Morten; Phelps, Matthew; Gislason, Gunnar H; Gerds, Thomas A; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Køber, Lars",JAMA,,646

Revisiting University Students’ Readiness For Online Education,2021,"Acute-care hospital reencounters (ACHEs)-encompassing emergency department visits, observation stays, and hospital readmissions-following COVID-19 hospitalization may exacerbate health care system strain and impair recovery from illness. We sought to characterize these reencounters and factors associated with reencounters. We identified the first consecutive 509 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 within an IL hospital network, and examined ACHEs, experienced within 30 days and 4 months of index hospitalization. We identified independent predictors of reencounter using binary logistic regression. Of 509 patients, 466 (91.6%) were discharged alive from index COVID-19 hospitalization. Within 30 days and 4 months, 12.4% and 21.5% of patients, respectively, experienced ACHEs. The median time to first ACHE was 24.2 (IQR 6.5, 55) days. COVID-19 symptom exacerbation was the leading reason for early ACHE (44.8%). Reencounters, both within 30 days and 4 months, were associated with a history of a neurological disorder before COVID-19 (OR 2.78 [95% CI 1.53, 5.03] and OR 2.75 [95% CI 1.67, 4.53], respectively). Older patients and those with diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or organ transplantation tended towards more frequent ACHEs. Steroid treatment during COVID-19 hospitalization demonstrated reduced odds of 30-day reencounter (OR 0.31 [95% CI 0.091, 0.79]). Forty-nine patients had repeat SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal testing during a reencounter; twelve (24.5%) patients had positive reencounter tests and experienced more frequent reencounters than those testing negative. COVID-19 symptom exacerbation is a leading cause of early ACHE after COVID-19 hospitalization, and steroid use during index hospitalization may reduce early reencounters. Neurologic illness before COVID-19 predicts ACHEs.","Clark, Jeffrey R; Batra, Ayush; Shlobin, Nathan A; Hoffman, Steven C; Orban, Zachary S; Koralnik, Igor J; Liotta, Eric M",Geroscience,,646

The paper examines the impact of government restrictive measures on the spread and effects of COVID-19. The work is devoted to the improvement of recommendation rules based on novel ensemble of machine learning methods such as regression tree and clustering. The dynamics of migration between countries in clusters, and their relationship with the number of confirmed cases and the percentage of deaths caused by COVID-19, were studied on the example of Poland, Italy and Germany. It is shown that there is a clear relationship between the cluster number and the number of new cases of diseases and death. It has also been shown that different countries' policies to prevent the disease, in particular the timing of restrictive measures, correlate with the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 and the consequences of the disease. For example, the results show a clear proactive tactic of restrictive measures by example of Germany, and catching up on the spread of the disease by example of Italy. A regression tree and guidelines about influence of features on the spreading of COVID-19 and mortality due to this infection have been constructed. The paper predicts the number of deaths due to COVID-19 on a 21-day interval using the obtained guidelines on the example of Sweden. Such forecasting was carried out for two potential government action options: with existing precautionary actions and the same precautionary actions, if they had been taken 20 days earlier (following the example of Germany). The RMSE of the mortality forecast does not exceed 4.2, which shows a good prognostic ability of the developed model. At the same time, the simulation based on the strategy of anticipatory introduction of restrictions gives 2-6% lower values of the forecast of the number of new cases. Thus, the results of this study provide an opportunity to assess the impact of decisions about restrictive measures and predict, simulate the consequences of restrictions policy.","Yakovyna, Vitaliy; Shakhovska, Natalya",Math Biosci Eng,,646

However, limited studies focused on the household air pollution especially in rural area, the potential risk induced by indoor air pollution exposure was unknown during this period. This field study continuously measured real-time PM2.5 levels in kitchen, living room, and outdoor in the normal days (Period-1) and the days of COVID-19 lockdown overlapping the Chinese Spring Festival (Period-2) in rural homes in China. The average daily PM2.5 concentrations increased by 17.4 and 5.1 µg/m3 in kitchen and living room during Period-2, respectively, which may be due to more fuel consumption for cooking and heating caused by larger family sizes than those during the normal days. The ambient PM2.5 concentration in rural areas in Period-2 decreased by 6.7 µg/m3 compared to the Period-1, less than the drop in urban areas (26.8 µg/m3). An increase of mass fraction of very fine particles in ambient air was observed during lockdown overlapping annual festival days, which could be explained by the residential solid fuel burning. Due to higher indoor air pollution level and longer time spent in indoor environments, daily personal exposure to PM2.5 was 134 ± 40 µg/m3 in Period-2, which was significantly higher than that during in Period-1 (126 ± 27 µg/m3, p < 0.05). The increase of personal PM2.5 exposure during Period-2 could potentially have negative impact on human health, indicating further investigations should be performed to estimate the health impact of global COVID-19 lockdown on community, especially in rural homes using solid fuels as the routine fuels.","Du, Wei; Wang, Jinze; Wang, Zhenglu; Lei, Yali; Huang, Ye; Liu, Shijie; Wu, Can; Ge, Shuangshuang; Chen, Yuanchen; Bai, Kaixu; Wang, Gehui",Chemosphere,,646

During and after the crisis, there are opportunities and needs for remote work facilities, online services, delivery drones, etc. We discuss how unmanned technologies can cause a long-term employment decrease, and why compensation mechanisms may not work. Using internationally comparable Frey-Osborne methodology, we estimated that less than a third of employees in Russia work in professions with a high automation probability. These professions can suffer the most during quarantine measures; employment in traditional services can be significantly reduced. Till 2030, about half of the jobs in the world and a little less in Russia need to adapt during fourth industrial revolution because they are engaged in routine, potentially automated activities. In the regions, specializing in manufacturing, this value is higher; the lowest risk is in the largest agglomerations with a high share of digital economy, greater and diverse labour markets. Accelerating technological change can lead to a long-term mismatch between the exponential increase in automation rate, compensating effects of retraining and new jobs creation. Some people will not be ready for a life-long learning and competition with robots, and accordingly there is a possibility of their technological exclusion. The term ‘nescience economy’ and corresponding assessment method were proposed. Using an econometric model, we identified factors that reduce these risks: human capital, business climate, quality of life and ICT development. Based on these factors, some recommendations for authorities were proposed in the conclusion.","Zemtsov, Stepan",Reg. Sci. Policy Pract.,,646

Coronavirus belongs to family coronaviridae with four genus viz. α/b and g-coronavirus, infecting both aves and mammals. The SARS-Cov-2 emerged in Wuhan, China in Dec, 2019 and since then had spread to 213 countries. Its origin is debatable with both natural origin and conspiracy theory providing no conclusive evidences. Coronavirus have ‘+’ive RNA and encodes for 29 proteins, which carries out its life cycle including infection and disease progression. The study of its proteome organization could illustrate the proteins which act as the key molecular players in the infection cycle of the virus. These proteins can also act as important drug targets in combating COVID-19 infection. Majority of the drugs have been formulated in order to act as agonist to spike proteins inhibiting infection by binding to ACE2 receptors. Proteome analysis has also revealed the critical mutated proteins that are responsible for COVID-19 pathogenesis and virulence. mRNA based vaccines (mRNA-1273, BNT162) also targets these spike proteins. Although DNA vaccine has also been attempted using RDT, but the high rate of mutation associated with COVID-19 have made such vaccines ineffective even before use. Thus evolutionarily conserved proteins have been the best candidature for vaccine development. Similarly phylogenetic analysis of its proteins could help us to understand the evolutionary pattern of COVID-19. It could be used to develop a predictable model for such pathogenic infections, preparing ourselves to take preventive action against its reoccurrence.","Bharadwaj, Alok; Wahi, Nitin; Saxena, Aditya; Chaudhary, Divya",J.

408195,Telepharmacy. Ready for its global implementation?,2020,"Usage of a face mask has become mandatory in many countries after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, and its usefulness in combating the pandemic is a proven fact. There have been many advancements in the design of a face mask and the present treatise describes a face mask in which a simple triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with an electrocution layer may serve the purpose of filtration and deactivation of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed mask is designed with multilayer filters, in which the inner three layers act as a triboelectric (TE) filter and the outer one as an electrocution layer (EL). The viral particles experience a mildshock in EL due to the electric field produced between the electrocution layers by contact electrification. Four pairs of triboelectric series fabrics, i.e. polyvinylchloride (PVC)-nylon, polypropylene (PP)-polyurethane (PU), latex rubber-PU, polyimide (PI)-nylon are studied to establish the efficacy of the mask. The motional force exerted on triboelectric filter materials can produce sufficient electric power to activate EL. The proposed mask can be used by a wide range of people because of its triboelectric self-powering (harvesting mechanical energy from daily activities, e.g. breathing, talking or other facial movements) functionalities to ensure effective filtration efficiency. More importantly, it is expected to be potentially beneficial to slow down the devastating impact of COVID-19.","Ghatak, Barnali; Banerjee, Sanjoy; Ali, Sk Babar; Bandyopadhyay, Rajib; Das, Nityananda; Mandal, Dipankar; Tudu, Bipan",Nano Energy,,646

Identifying COVID-19 phenotypes might help guide basic, clinical, and translational research efforts. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does the clinical spectrum of patients with COVID-19 contain distinct phenotypes and subphenotypes? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We included adult patients (&#8805; 18 years) positive for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from a prospective COVID-19 registry database in the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio and Florida. The patients were split into training and testing sets. Using latent class analysis (LCA), we first identified phenotypic clusters of patients with COVID-19 based on demographics, comorbidities, and presenting symptoms. We then identified subphenotypes of hospitalized patients with additional blood biomarker data measured on hospital admission. The associations of phenotypes/subphenotypes and clinical outcomes were investigated. Multivariable prediction models were established to predict assignment to the LCA-defined phenotypes and subphenotypes and then evaluated on an independent testing set. RESULTS: We analyzed data for 20,572 patients. Seven phenotypes were identified on the basis of different profiles of presenting COVID-19 symptoms and existing comorbidities, including the following groups: young, no symptoms; young, symptoms; middle-aged, no symptoms; middle-aged, symptoms; middle-aged, comorbidities; old, no symptoms; and old, symptoms. The rates of inpatient hospitalization for the phenotypes were significantly different (P < .001). Five subphenotypes were identified for the subgroup of hospitalized patients, including the following subgroups: young, elevated WBC and platelet counts; middle-aged, lymphopenic with elevated C-reactive protein; middle-aged, hyperinflammatory; old, leukopenic with comorbidities; and old, hyperinflammatory with kidney dysfunction. The hospital mortality and the times from hospitalization to ICU transfer or death were significantly different (P < .001). The models for predicting the LCA-defined phenotypes and subphenotypes showed high discrimination (concordance index, 0.92 and 0.91). INTERPRETATION: Hypothesis-free LCA-defined phenotypes and subphenotypes of patients with COVID-19 can be identified. These may help clinical investigators conduct stratified analyses in clinical trials and assist basic science researchers in characterizing the pathobiology of the spectrum of COVID-19 presentations.","Wang, Xiaofeng; Jehi, Lara; Ji, Xinge; Mazzone, Peter J",Chest,,646

In addition, these compounds also exhibited good inhibitory activity against the 3CLpro and the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), especially compound 18p (IC50 = 0.034 µM, EC50 = 0.29 µM). According to our previous work, these compounds have no reasons for concern regarding acute toxicity. Compared with AG7088, compound 18p also exhibited good pharmacokinetic properties and more potent anticoronavirus activity, making it an excellent lead for further development.","Dai, Wenhao; Jochmans, Dirk; Xie, Hang; Yang, Hang; Li, Jian; Su, Haixia; Chang, Di; Wang, Jiang; Peng, Jingjing; Zhu, Lili; Nian, Yong; Hilgenfeld, Rolf; Jiang, Hualiang; Chen, Kaixian; Zhang, Leike; Xu, Yechun; Neyts, Johan; Liu, Hong",J. med. chem,,646

OUTBREAK SITUATION: A stringent screening process at all airports in Malaysia was enforced after the first case outside China was reported in Thailand. Up to April 14, 2020, Malaysia had reported two waves of COVID-19 cases, with the first wave ending successfully within less than 2 months. In early March 2020, the second wave occurred, with worrying situations. ACTIONS TAKEN: The Government of Malaysia enforced a Movement Control Order starting on March 18, 2020 to break the chain of COVID-19. The media actively spread the hashtag #stayhome. Non-governmental organizations, as well as prison inmates, started to produce personal protective equipment for frontliners. Various organizations hosted fundraising events to provide essentials mainly to hospitals. A provisional hospital was set up and collaborations with healthcare service providers were granted, while additional laboratories were assigned to enhance the capabilities of the Ministry of Health. ECONOMIC DOWNTURN: An initial financial stimulus amounting to RM 20.0 billion was released in February 2020, before the highlighted PRIHATIN Package, amounting to RM 250 billion, was announced. The PRIHATIN Package has provided governmental support to society, covering people of various backgrounds from students and families to business owners.","Shah, Ain Umaira Md; Safri, Syafiqah Nur Azrie; Thevadas, Rathedevi; Noordin, Nor Kamariah; Rahman, Azmawani Abd; Sekawi, Zamberi; Ideris, Aini; Sultan, Mohamed Thariq Hameed",Int J Infect Dis,,646

412084,Distance teaching practicum: Its impact on pre-service EFL teachers’ preparedness for teaching,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the current practice trends for managing symptomatic cartilage lesions of the knee with microfracture among ICRS (International Cartilage Regeneration & Joint Repair Society) members. DESIGN: A 42-item electronic questionnaire was sent to all ICRS members, which explored indications, surgical technique, postoperative management, and outcomes of the microfracture procedure for the treatment of symptomatic, full thickness chondral and osteochondral defects of the knee. Responses were compared between surgeons from different regions and years of practice. RESULTS: A total of 385 surgeons answered the questionnaire. There was a significant difference noted in the use of microfracture among surgeons by region (P < 0.001). There was no association between the number of years in practice and the self-reported proportion of microfracture cases performed (P = 0.37). Fifty-eight subjects (15%) indicated that they do not perform microfracture at all. Regarding indication for surgery, 56% of surgeons would limit their indication of microfracture to lesions measuring 2 cm2 or less. Half of the surgeons reported no upper age or body mass index limit. Regarding surgical technique, 90% of surgeons would recommend a formal debridement of the calcified layer and 91% believe it is important to create stable vertical walls. Overall, 47% of surgeons use biologic augmentation, with no significant difference between regions (P = 0.35) or years of practice (P = 0.67). Rehabilitation protocols varied widely among surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: Indications, operative technique, and rehabilitation protocols utilized for patients undergoing microfracture procedures vary widely among ICRS members. Regional differences and resources likely contribute to these practice pattern variations.","Medina, Jesus; Garcia-Mansilla, Ignacio; Fabricant, Peter D; Kremen, Thomas J; Sherman, Seth L; Jones, Kristofer",Cartilage,,646

Although the symptoms and imaging manifestations of COVID-19 predominantly involve the respiratory system, it is fundamental to know the manifestations of the disease and its possible complications in other organs to help in diagnosis and orient the prognosis. To improve the diagnostic process without increasing the risk of contagion unnecessarily, it is crucial to know when extrathoracic imaging tests are indicated and which tests are best in each situation. This paper aims to provide answers to these questions. To this end, we describe and illustrate the extrathoracic imaging manifestations of COVID-19 in adults as well as the entire spectrum of imaging findings in children.","Plasencia-Martínez, J M; Rovira, À; Caro Domínguez, P; Barber, I; García-Garrigós, E; Arenas-Jiménez, J J",,,646

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether COVID-19-related GT data, particularly those related to ageusia and anosmia, were primarily related to media coverage or to epidemic trends. METHODS: We retrieved GT query data for searches on coronavirus, cough, anosmia, and ageusia and plotted them over a period of 5 years. In addition, we analyzed the trends of those queries for 17 countries throughout the year 2020 with a particular focus on the rises and peaks of the searches. For anosmia and ageusia, we assessed whether the respective GT data correlated with COVID-19 cases and deaths both throughout 2020 and specifically before March 16, 2020 (ie, the date when the media started reporting that these symptoms can be associated with COVID-19). RESULTS: Over the last five years, peaks for coronavirus searches in GT were only observed during the winter of 2020. Rises and peaks in coronavirus searches appeared at similar times in the 17 different assessed countries irrespective of their epidemic situations. In 15 of these countries, rises in anosmia and ageusia searches occurred in the same week or 1 week after they were identified in the media as symptoms of COVID-19. When data prior to March 16, 2020 were analyzed, anosmia and ageusia GT data were found to have variable correlations with COVID-19 cases and deaths in the different countries. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that COVID-19-related GT data are more closely related to media coverage than to epidemic trends.","Sousa-Pinto, Bernardo; Anto, Aram; Czarlewski, Wienia; Anto, Josep M; Fonseca, João Almeida; Bousquet, Jean",J Med Internet Res,,646

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary care university hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this study, 1337 consecutive patients with glottic carcinoma who underwent surgical treatment from 2005 to 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. The influence of tumor size that was evaluated by tumor area (tumor length × tumor width) on OS and DFS outcomes was assessed by Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: In all, 1303 (97.5%) patients were male, and 34 (2.5%) were female, with a mean ± SD age of 60.4 ± 10 years. The 10-year OS and DFS rates were 72.9% and 69.9%, respectively. The tumor area cutoff values that best discriminated OS and DFS rates were both 1.80 cm2. Patients with glottic carcinoma with a larger tumor area had inferior OS and DFS rates. Based on the results of multivariate analyses, tumor area was an independent prognostic factor for rates of OS (hazard ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.37-2.56; P < .001) and DFS (hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.34-2.38; P < .001) in patients with glottic carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that patients with glottic carcinoma with a tumor area >1.8 cm2 have inferior survival outcomes, and this factor independently predicts survival outcomes in these patients.","Gong, Hongli; Zhou, Liang; Wu, Haitao; Tao, Lei; Zhang, Ming; Chen, Xiaoling; Li, Xiaoming; Li, Cai; Zhou, Jian; Wang, Shuyi",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,646

Methods: A total of 36 patients (20 males, 16 females, aged from 14 to 74 years old) who underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from November 2018 to April 2019 were enrolled into the retrospective study, including 11 cases of ECRSwNP, 15 cases of non-ECRSwNP and 10 cases in control group (deviation of nasal septum). The patients were divided into allergic rhinitis and non-allergic rhinitis groups, atopy and non-atopy groups according to whether patients in the experimental group and control group had allergic rhinitis and atopy. HE staining was performed for histological assessment of CRSwNP which was classfied as ECRSwNP and non-ECRSwNP. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to determine the positive localization and semi-quantitative expression level of galectin-10 protein in ERSwNP, non-ECRSwNP and control groups. The expression levels of galectin-10 protein in three groups were determined by Western Blot. The expression levels of galectin-10 mRNA in three groups were determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Analyzing the correlation between the expression of galectin-10 and clinical factors including the allergic rhinitis and atopy, SPSS 19.0 software and Graphpad prism 7.0 were used for statistical analysis and mapping. Results: By using IHC method, it was found that galectin-10 was mainly localized in eosinophils in the polyp tissues. The semi-quantitative expression of the galectin-10 in the ECRSwNP group (0.051±0.003) was significantly higher than that of non-ECRSwNP (0.028±0.004) and control groups (0.025±0.004, t value was 3.862 and 5.137, both P<0.01). There was no significant difference between the control and non-ECRSwNP groups (t=0.560, P>0.05). The expression of galectin-10 in the ECRSwNP group was significantly higher than that of non-ECRSwNP and control groups (t value was 25.351 and 27.376, both P<0.01). However, there was no significant difference between the non-ECRSwNP and control groups (t=1.071, P>0.05). Compared with the non-ECRSwNP (1.188±0.054) and control groups (1.020±0.142), the expression of galectin-10 mRNA was higher in the ECRSwNP group (2.413±0.303), the differences were significant (t value was 3.973 and 4.156, both P<0.05). There was no significant difference between the non-ECRSwNP and control groups (t=1.110, P>0.05). There was no significant difference in the expression of galectin-10 between the allergic rhinitis group and the non-allergic rhinitis group (all P>0.05), so as to the atopy group and non-atopy group(all P>0.05). Conclusion: The expression level of galectin-10 is elevated in ECRSwNP, and not influenced by allergic status, suggesting that galectin-10 may be a new biomarker for ECRSwNP and play an important role in the pathogenesis of ECRSwNP.","Li, C H; Liu, X; Wu, W X; Wang, Y J; Ai, Y F; Liu, H B",Zhonghua Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi,,646

The series of evaluations included different sets of subjects consisting of up to five Black Hawk helicopter aircrew members, air traffic control (ATC), and 12 CH-47 aircrew members. The Modified Rhyme Test was used to measure speech intelligibility and was administered in the UH-60 among crewmembers of the same aircraft, between pilots of different aircraft, and between the pilots and ATC. Measures of workload, usability, comfort, and pulse oximetry were also administered.RESULTS: Results from the Modified Rhyme Test indicated that all subjects scored greater than 80% accuracy given the proper microphone positioning relative to the mask. With respect to workload, NASA-TLX total scores for the perform radio communications task was 50.83.DISCUSSION: Despite an elevated perceived degree of workload on the communications flight task, results from the speech intelligibility test indicated that performance was maintained within the acceptable range as defined by MIL-STD-1474E, Design Criteria Standard Noise Limit.

Only limited data describe the efforts to recruit COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors. We describe our experience engaging persons recovered from COVID-19 to donate CCP. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the CCP recruitment for an 11-hospital health system in Houston, Texas. We sought CCP donations from: a) ""volunteers"" responding to advertisements in social media, press releases, and websites and b) ""referred"" individuals directed to the program or identified from hospitalization records. We determined the proportions of donor candidates who passed initial telephone health screening, who qualified after diagnostic testing, who presented to the regional CCP donation center, and who completed CCP donation. RESULTS: There were 900 CCP donor candidates, including 363 volunteers and 537 referred donors. Of 360 contacted volunteers, 186 (5.7%) were excluded by interview; 133 were referred for additional diagnostic screening, 97 completed donor antibody and antigen testing, and 87 were qualified for CCP donation, resulting in 35 CCP donations (9.7% of initial telephone contacts). Among 533 referred donors, 448 (84.1%) were excluded by interview, 71 were referred for additional screening, 48 completed donor antibody and antigen testing, and 40 were qualified for CCP donation, resulting in one CCP donation (0.2% of initial telephone contacts). CONCLUSION: In this community, screening of a high number of candidates yielded a limited number of CCP donations. These observations have important implications for CCP donor recruitment and community pandemic planning.","Wang, Henry E; Ostrosky-Zeichner, Luis; Katz, Jeffrey; Wanger, Audrey; Bai, Yu; Sridhar, Sujatha; Patel, Bela",Transfusion,,646

The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of the parents of pediatric patients about dental treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic through a questionnaire. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A structured questionnaire consisting of 15 multiple-choice questions and demographic information about the knowledge and attitudes of parents regarding dental treatment during the COVID-19 outbreak was used for the study. The participants were parents of pediatric patients (aged 8-14 years) who visited for a routine orthodontic examination at the department of orthodontics. RESULTS: A total of 250 participants responded to the questionnaire. The findings indicate that more than 95% of parents had information about the transmission paths of the virus, took COVID-19 seriously, and told their children about this disease. 34% of the parents thought that dental clinics were more dangerous than other social areas, and 39.2% thought their children could be infected by medical instruments during dental treatment. A statistically significant difference was observed between educational levels in the answers given about the transmission paths of the virus, the danger of dental clinics in terms of the virus, the permitted dental treatment procedures, and the personal protective equipment of the dentist (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although most parents have information about COVID-19, there are differences in the knowledge and attitudes of parents during the pandemic period according to their educational level.","Surme, Koray; Akman, Hayri; Cime Akbaydogan, Leyla; Akin, Mehmet",Oral Health Prev Dent,,646

Multiple scholars have identified employees' readiness for change as an important factor of successful organisational change, but research focussed on psychological factors that facilitate change readiness is scarce. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether employee dispositional mindfulness contributes to readiness for change. Design/methodology/approach Employees (n = 301) from various industries in New Zealand participated in an online survey shortly after the local COVID-19 lockdown ended. The employees' levels of mindfulness, readiness for change, well-being and distress were assessed using well-validated psychometric scales. Multiple regression analyses tested the effect of mindfulness on readiness for change, with well-being and distress as moderating variables. Findings The results show that the effect of mindfulness on readiness for change is moderated by both well-being and distress. Mindfulness has a positive, significant effect on readiness for change when levels of well-being are high and levels of distress are low. Practical implications These findings have important implications for organisations who aim to promote readiness for change in their employees. Even though mindfulness has been shown to be beneficial, organisations also have to consider the mental states of their employees when managing change. Originality/value This study provides empirical evidence that dispositional mindfulness may facilitate the employees' readiness for change, but only when levels of well-being are high and distress are low.","Roemer, A.; Sutton, A.; Medvedev, O.

Yet, there are no prospective studies comparing weaning strategies for liberation from ECMO. RESEARCH QUESTION: Is a protocolized daily assessment of readiness to liberate from VV-ECMO safe and feasible? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, single-arm, safety and feasibility study of a protocol for daily assessment of readiness to liberate from VV-ECMO among consecutive adult patients receiving VV-ECMO across four intensive care units at a single center between June 20, 2020 and November 24, 2020. The ECMO-free protocol included three-phases: 1) the safety screen, 2) non-ECMO fraction of inspired oxygen titration, and 3) the ECMO-free trial. Enrollment, interventions, and data collection were performed prospectively by trained study staff. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients received the ECMO-free protocol on 385 patient-days. The safety screen was passed during a total of 59 ECMO-free daily assessments (15.3%) among 20 patients. Every passed safety screen proceeded to an ECMO-free trial. There were 28 (47.5%) passed ECMO-free trials among 16 patients (61.5%). There were no missed safety screens, protocol deviations, or adverse events. Of the 16 patients who passed an ECMO-free trial, 14 (87.5%) were decannulated. Among decannulated patients, 12 (85.7%) were decannulated on the same day as a passed ECMO-free trial, 6 (42.9%) were decannulated on the first day that they passed an ECMO-free trial, and 6 (42.9%) passed an ECMO-free trial at least twice consecutively before decannulation. The median time from first passed ECMO-free trial to decannulation was 2 days (IQR, 0 to 3 days). INTERPRETATIONS: The ECMO-free protocol is feasible and may identify patients for decannulation earlier than gradual approaches to weaning.","Gannon, Whitney D; Stokes, John W; Bloom, Sarah; Sherrill, Wren; Bacchetta, Matthew; Rice, Todd W; Semler, Matthew W; Casey, Jonathan D",Chest,,646

433847,Persfektif Siyâsah Syar’Iyyah Tentang Darurat Negara Dalam Penanganan Pandemi COVID-19,2020,"PCOS is a common and heterogeneous endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, frequently associated with metabolic abnormalities. It was estimated that about 75% of these subjects have an impairment of insulin action, as measured by gold standard methods. While the relationship between insulin resistance and PCOS is consistently shown by a number of studies, the mechanisms underlying its primary origin still remains an unsolved issue. Insulin resistance and the associated hyperinsulinemia can induce both the endocrine and reproductive traits of PCOS. However, androgen excess, in turn, can impair insulin action, directly and/or through several changes occurring in different tissues. Body fat excess, which is another common feature in these women, can contribute to worsening the whole picture. Nevertheless, insulin resistance may also be found in many normal-weight individuals. Endocrine and metabolic abnormalities can develop in different moments, and probably there is fetal programming of these alterations. However, a number of vicious circles, with bidirectional relationships between androgen excess and insulin resistance, and with the contribution of several other factors, make it extremely difficult to understand where this process really originates. This review summarizes available evidence on this topic, in order to better understand the complex relationships linking hyperandrogenism and impaired insulin action in women with PCOS.","Moghetti, P; Tosi, F",J. endocrinol. invest,,646

433980,The Social Cost of Contract,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To outline changes made to a neurology residency program in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: In early March 2020, the first cases of COVID-19 were announced in the United States. New York City quickly became the epicenter of a global pandemic, and our training program needed to rapidly adapt to the increasing number of inpatient cases while being mindful of protecting providers and continuing education. Many of these changes unfolded over days, including removing residents from outpatient services, minimizing the number of residents on inpatient services, deploying residents to medicine services and medical intensive care units, converting continuity clinic patient visits to virtual options, transforming didactics to online platforms only, and maintaining connectedness in an era of social distancing. We have been able to accomplish this through daily virtual meetings among leadership, faculty, and residents. RESULTS: Over time, our program has successfully rolled out initiatives to service the growing number of COVID-related inpatients while maintaining neurologic care for those in need and continuing our neurologic education curriculum. CONCLUSION: It has been necessary and feasible for our residency training program to undergo rapid structural changes to adapt to a medical crisis. The key ingredients in doing this successfully have been flexibility and teamwork. We suspect that many of the implemented changes will persist long after the COVID-19 crisis has passed and will change the approach to neurologic and medical training.","Agarwal, Shashank; Sabadia, Sakinah; Abou-Fayssal, Nada; Kurzweil, Arielle; Balcer, Laura J; Galetta, Steven L",Neurology,,646

With the investigation of the gut-lung axis, more studies have demonstrated the important role of gut microbiota in lung inflammation. The precise role of the gut microbiota in chickens-associated colibacillosis, however, is unknown. Thus, this study assessed the function of the gut microbiota in the chicken defense against APEC infection. Chicken gut microbiota was depleted by drinking water with a mixture of antibiotics (Abx), and subsequently, a model of colibacillosis was established by the intranasal perfusion of APEC. The results showed that gut microbiota protects the chicken challenge by APEC from aggravated lung histopathologic injury, up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and increased bacterial load in lung tissues compared with controls. In addition, the air-blood barrier permeability was significantly increased in gut microbiota-depleted chickens compared to the control chickens after challenge with APEC. Furthermore, feeding acetate significantly inhibited the lung inflammatory response and the reduced air-blood permeability induced by APEC infection. The expression of free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2), a receptor for acetate, was also increased in the lung after treatment with acetate. In conclusion, depletion of the gut microbiota resulted in increased susceptibility of chickens to APEC challenge, and gut microbiota derived acetate acted as a protective mediator during the APEC challenge. Novel therapeutic targets that focus on the gut microbiota may be effective in controlling colibacillosis in poultry.","Peng, Lu-Yuan; Shi, Hai-Tao; Gong, Zi-Xuan; Yi, Peng-Fei; Tang, Bo; Shen, Hai-Qing; Fu, Ben-Dong",Vet Microbiol,,646

COVID-19 response measures specifically alter regular schedules and both restrict and expand opportunities for various types of crime while presenting unprecedented challenges for the criminal justice system. For criminologists and criminal justice scientists, the virus also presents natural experiment conditions allowing for real-world theory tests and observation of the relative effectiveness of practice and policy options under weighty conditions. Toward synthesizing scientific discourse and forthcoming empirical work, we suggest the benefits of a COVID-19 crime and justice research program and offer some anchoring concepts. Contagion, containment measures (social distancing, facemasks, shelter-in-place, economic shutdown, virtual work and schooling, banned group gatherings), and social ordinance compliance (voluntary or enforced) posture a conceptual framework from which to align research on crime, justice, and victimization during the virus. After observing crime trends and justice system challenges, we suggest how the pandemic presents opportunities for review of various criminal justice, especially incarceration, policies. System change is a recurring theme across this special issue of the American Journal of Criminal Justice that features twenty additional contributions from a wide range of authoritative crime and justice scholars. These articles on traditional crime during the virus, virus specific hate crime and domestic violence, and the challenges posed by COVID-19 to law enforcement, the courts, and corrections will hopefully provide initial commentary toward deeper inquiry.","Miller, J Mitchell; Blumstein, Alfred",Am J Crim Justice,,646
437593,Reimagining Corporate Social Responsibility in the Era of COVID-19: Embedding Resilience and Promoting Corporate Social Competence,2021,"Background: At the beginning of the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic the focus of attention was on children and adolescents with chronic lung diseases. Due to a lack of epidemiological data and clinical experience, it was feared that children with respiratory diseases were a risk group for particularly severe courses of COVID-19, as has been reported for adults. Objective: The currently available (epidemiological) data on this patient group are presented as well as a description of our own experiences based on three selected cases. Material and methods: A review of the literature was carried out and three selected case reports and a discussion of current recommendations are presented. Results: The incidence of COVID-19 is significantly lower in children than in adults. Furthermore, the known risk factors in adults cannot be simply transferred to pediatric patients. In the majority of cases, children and adolescents with chronic lung diseases show a milder course of SARS-CoV­2 infections. Conclusion: Although the hitherto available data show that children and adolescents have a lower risk for COVID-19 courses than adults, it should not be ignored that fatal outcomes have also been reported in pediatric patients. Moreover, late effects, such as the pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) can sometimes lead to a fatal outcome. Nevertheless, care must be taken that this vulnerable patient group does not suffer from avoidable negative side effects of restriction and isolation measures. As an example, the no-show behavior in outpatient departments during the lockdown might have led to a relevant undertreatment of underlying chronic health conditions.","Kiefer, A; Kerzel, S",Pneumologe (Berl),,646

Two critical issues arise: How timing of delivery of the second dose will affect infection dynamics and how it will affect prospects for the evolution of viral immune escape via a buildup of partially immune individuals. Both hinge on the robustness of the immune response elicited by a single dose as compared with natural and two-dose immunity. Building on an existing immuno-epidemiological model, we find that in the short term, focusing on one dose generally decreases infections, but that longer-term outcomes depend on this relative immune robustness. We then explore three scenarios of selection and find that a one-dose policy may increase the potential for antigenic evolution under certain conditions of partial population immunity. We highlight the critical need to test viral loads and quantify immune responses after one vaccine dose and to ramp up vaccination efforts globally.","Saad-Roy, Chadi M; Morris, Sinead E; Metcalf, C Jessica E; Mina, Michael J; Baker, Rachel E; Farrar, Jeremy; Holmes, Edward C; Pybus, Oliver G; Graham, Andrea L; Levin, Simon A; Grenfell, Bryan T; Wagner, Caroline E",Science,,646

Community pharmacists in the US are highly visible and accessible to the public and have long been regarded as a source for immunization services as well as other public health activities. In the US, the scope of pharmacy practice continues to expand and incorporate various health services on a state-by-state level. For the purposes of this article, a PubMed literature search was undertaken to identify published articles on SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, pharmacist- and pharmacy-based immunization and other public health care activities in the US in order to identify and discuss roles that community pharmacists can play during this pandemic including as vaccinators, screeners and testers. In conclusion, community pharmacists are knowledgeable and capable providers of public health services and are easily accessible and well regarded by the public. The incorporation of community pharmacists into this nation's COVID-19 pandemic response plan can help aid recovery efforts in the US.","Hess, Karl; Bach, Albert; Won, Kimberly; Seed, Sheila M",J Pharm Pract,,646
442394,Spatial and temporal variation characteristics of atmospheric NO2 and SO2 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region before and after the COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"Last year the Europe and world were facing with COVID-19 outbreak that put at the risk lives of the people and capability of healthcare systems to provide their services. To prevent spread of the COVID-19 governments have imposed restrictive measures, while some of them declared state of emergency. The response to the pandemic influenced on the functioning of the criminal justice system and daily operation of courts, but also on the substantive criminal law since some states are applying criminal law to violation of restrictive measures or to criminalizing disinformation on COVID-19 outbreak. Outbreak of COVID-19 revealed new trends in criminal law like accelerated introduction of new crimes during pandemic, extremely flexible interpretation and rapid changes of criminal laws, which tend to be threat for legal stability and human rights protection. In addition, populist governments tend to use that new trend as a tool in suppression of political dissidents. COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedent challenges to the functioning of judiciaries. Courts and prosecution services were working with limited capacities to ensure social distancing. Some countries introduced ICT tools and fast-track procedures to organize hearings, which raised question of procedural rights and protection of rights of defendant. In the article authors assessed whether derogation of fair trial rights was in the line with standards of international human rights law and if introduction of state of emergency and restrictions were proportionate, time limited and needed and whether they changed understanding of the fundamental rights protection, especially right to a fair trial. Furthermore, authors explore whether COVID 19 changed perception of criminal law and legal certainty. Authors assessed how restrictions in the organization of judiciary work influenced on human rights protection and citizens trust in judiciary. Consequently, authors assesses whether some of introduces changes, especially use of ICT tools made permanent changes in operation of courts and understanding of access to justice. Finally, authors are assessing whether these changes tend to erode judiciaries or put into the risk access to justice in the EU members states and candidate countries or whether they jeopardized EU principle of mutual trust.","Bošković, Marina Matić PhD Nenadić Svetlana PhD",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,,646

443047,Factors Affecting the Quality of E-learning during the Covid-19 Pandemic from the Perspective of Higher Education Students,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges for surgical teaching programs, as operating rooms closed and resources were redirected for patient care. As a result, both educational challenges and opportunities emerged. The objective of this study was to assess the changes used by plastic surgery programs as a result of the pandemic. METHODS: A 34-question American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons-approved survey was distributed on April 29, 2020, to attendings in academic plastic surgery programs in the United States. Variables were controlled whenever multiple attending responses were submitted from the same program. RESULTS: A total of 113 attendings, including 30 (27.8%) program directors, responded to the survey. Most respondents were located in the northeast (41.4%). The average percentage of elective case volume was 23% of pre-COVID states. Those who reported a decrease in emergent surgical case volume (55.2%) estimated it to be at an average of 45% of the normal. Almost all the respondents (95.6%) agreed that they were working fewer hours than usual, and 40.9% of those reported a decrease of more than 20 hours per week of work. Most attendings (82.1%) also reported a decrease in their monthly salary. The percentage projected current salary compared with normal was 85%. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey data suggest that academic plastic surgery programs have had impactful changes to their operative and educational schedules, teaching, revenue, and patient care. The data described in this study could be used as a baseline for future pandemics affecting plastic surgery programs to help strategize their operational and educational structures.","Mehrzad, Raman; Akiki, Ronald; Liu, Paul Y; Schmidt, Scott; Woo, Albert S",Ann. plast. sur,,646

The strategy of managing the dental clinics is quite different from that of the medical healthcare clinics, and the key point of the administration of those dental healthcare providers is to focus on the management of outpatient care because they only supply just a little bit of inpatient care service but quite an large amount of outpatient care service. So we think the next step is to make plausible and effective scenarios to protect our dental healthcare staff and patients against corona virus infection during the treatments procedures after the reopening all of our dental clinics. To overcome this harsh condition, the infection prevention and control strategies adopted by the Stomatological Hospital, Southern Medical University were designed to be flexible and could be adjusted promptly according to the national and local governmental orders and latest guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All these prevention procedures and protocols were customized to fit our own situation and have been updated for several times based on the latest global pandemic reports. After going through the hardest time in the past four months, it&rsquo;s considered that our COVID-19 prevention rules have been proved to be efficient and work well. Further more, it has made massive progress for the hospital in improving the capability of dealing with this state of emergency, especially by previewing and triaging patients strictly to cut off the possible coronavirus spreading from the original step, enhancing the standard precautions and those specific protocols made for minimizing the droplets, aerosol and contact transmission of COVID-19 indoors. Besides, a daily supervision system was set up as a routine job and a team of qualified infection prevention specialists were assigned to check and report every incorrect details during the whole procedure of dental practice. Meanwhile, the safety and well-being of the public and our medical workers could be also guaranteed through following those detailed prevention scenarios.","Mei, LI; Yifan, CHEN; Fanping, CHENG; Yarong, HOU; Wenjuan, YIN; Jianjiang, ZHAO; Shaohong, HUANG",Journal of Prevention and Treatment for Stomatological Diseases,,646

447555,The politics of policing a pandemic panic,2020,"BACKGROUND: BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (3 µg or 6 µg) formulated with a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule (IMDG) adsorbed to alum (Algel). We previously reported findings from a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial on the safety and immunogenicity of three different formulations of BBV152 (3 µg with Algel-IMDG, 6 µg with Algel-IMDG, or 6 µg with Algel) and one Algel-only control (no antigen), with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 14. The 3 µg and 6 µg with Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for this phase 2 study. Herein, we report interim findings of the phase 2 trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152, with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 28. METHODS: We did a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152 in healthy adults and adolescents (aged 12-65 years) at nine hospitals in India. Participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 3 µg with Algel-IMDG or 6 µg with Algel-IMDG. Block randomisation was done by use of an interactive web response system. Participants, investigators, study coordinators, study-related personnel, and the sponsor were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccine were administered on day 0 and day 28. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 wild-type neutralising antibody titres and seroconversion rates (defined as a post-vaccination titre that was at least four-fold higher than the baseline titre) at 4 weeks after the second dose (day 56), measured by use of the plaque-reduction neutralisation test (PRNT50) and the microneutralisation test (MNT50). The primary outcome was assessed in all participants who had received both doses of the vaccine. Cell-mediated responses were a secondary outcome and were assessed by T-helper-1 (Th1)/Th2 profiling at 2 weeks after the second dose (day 42). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the vaccine. In addition, we report immunogenicity results from a follow-up blood draw collected from phase 1 trial participants at 3 months after they received the second dose (day 104). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04471519. FINDINGS: Between Sept 5 and 12, 2020, 921 participants were screened, of whom 380 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group (n=190) or 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group (n=190). Geometric mean titres (GMTs; PRNT50) at day 56 were significantly higher in the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group (197·0 [95% CI 155·6-249·4]) than the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group (100·9 [74·1-137·4]; p=0·0041). Seroconversion based on PRNT50 at day 56 was reported in 171 (92·9% [95% CI 88·2-96·2] of 184 participants in the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group and 174 (98·3% [95·1-99·6]) of 177 participants in the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group. GMTs (MNT50) at day 56 were 92·5 (95% CI 77·7-110·2) in the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group and 160·1 (135·8-188·8) in the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group. Seroconversion based on MNT50 at day 56 was reported in 162 (88·0% [95% CI 82·4-92·3]) of 184 participants in the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group and 171 (96·6% [92·8-98·8]) of 177 participants in the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group. The 3 µg with Algel-IMDG and 6 µg with Algel-IMDG formulations elicited T-cell responses that were biased to a Th1 phenotype at day 42. No significant difference in the proportion of participants who had a solicited local or systemic adverse reaction in the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group (38 [20·0%; 95% CI 14·7-26·5] of 190) and the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group (40 [21·1%; 15·5-27·5] of 190) was observed on days 0-7 and days 28-35; no serious adverse events were reported in the study. From the phase 1 trial, 3-month post-second-dose GMTs (MNT50) were 39·9 (95% CI 32·0-49·9) in the 3µg with Algel-IMDG group, 69·5 (53·7-89·9) in the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group, 53·3 (40·1-71·0) in the 6 µg with Algel group, and 20·7 (14·5-29·5) in the Algel alone group. INTERPRETATION: In the phase 1 trial, BBV152 induced high neutralising antibody responses that remained elevated in all participants at 3 months after the second vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 showed better reactogenicity and safety outcomes, and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses compared with the phase 1 trial. The 6 µg with Algel-IMDG formulation has been selected for the phase 3 efficacy trial. FUNDING: Bharat Biotech International.

447640,The COVID-19 pandemic and organisational learning for disaster planning and management: A perspective of tourism businesses from a destination prone to consecutive disasters,2021,"Websites have become the primary means by which the US federal government communicates about its operations and presents information for public consumption. However, the alteration or removal of critical information from these sites is often entirely legal and done without the public's awareness. Relative to paper records, websites enable governments to shape public understanding in quick, scalable, and permissible ways. During the Trump administration, website changes indicative of climate denial prompted civil society organizations to develop tools for tracking online government information sources. We in the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI) illustrate how five data visualization techniques can be used to document and analyze changes to government websites. We examine a large sample of websites of US federal environmental agencies and show that between 2016 and 2020: 1) the use of the term ""climate change"" decreased by an estimated 38%; 2) access to as much as 20% of the Environmental Protection Agency's website was removed; 3) changes were made more to Cabinet agencies' websites and to highly visible pages. In formulating ways to visualize and assess the alteration of websites, our study lays important groundwork for both systematically tracking changes and holding officials more accountable for their web practices. Our techniques enable researchers and watchdog groups alike to operate at the scale necessary to understand the breadth of impact an administration can have on the online face of government.","Nost, Eric; Gehrke, Gretchen; Poudrier, Grace; Lemelin, Aaron; Beck, Marcy; Wylie, Sara",PLoS One,,646
447785,Futureproofing Assessment in Business Education: Lessons From COVID-19,2021,"With the advancement of small watershed governance in agricultural production process, soil toxic element pollution issue in watersheds constitutes a recent research hot spot. The Ashi River watershed is an agriculture-dominated small watershed which is exposed to toxic element sources, posing high risk of toxic element pollution to the planting areas. In this study, collection of soil samples was carried out along the periphery of the river network, and the soil physicochemical parameters and toxic elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn) were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) The geo-accumulation index (Igeo) and potential ecological risk index were used to evaluate the pollution degree, and the contents of As, Cd, and Zn in some sampling sites exceeded risk screening values. Moreover, soils closer to mining sources were found to be more polluted; (2) Redundancy analysis confirmed the contribution rate relationship between environmental factors and toxic elements. C/N ratio, total carbon (C), and total potassium (K) exhibited significant relationships with toxic elements (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), respectively. Moreover, geographic locations (longitude, latitude, and elevation) showed significant impacts on toxic element contents (except for Cu); (3) The apportionment of toxic element pollution sources by using principal component analysis showed that Pb, Zn, Cu, and Cd were mainly related to mining activities, while As was closely related to insecticide and herbicide, and Cr was mainly related to soil parent material and electroplating factory; (4) Through the integrated resistance base surface and toxic element sources combined with minimum cumulative resistance model, the toxic element risk areas were identified. The middle reaches corresponded to the extremely high risk zone, which undeniably requires the strengthening of the environmental management.","Guo, Xiaomeng; Wang, Li; Ma, Fang; You, Yongqiang; Ju, Chang",Sci Total Environ,,646

449639,Impact of Non-Monetary Factors on Retention of Higher Education Institues Teachers Through Mediating Role of Motivation,2021,"Here, we report for the first time DNA aptamers targeted toward the COVID-19 nucleocapsid protein (Np). Np is one of the most abundant structural proteins and it serves as a diagnostic marker for the accurate and sensitive detection of COVID-19. After five rounds of selection, we obtained four DNA sequences with an affinity below 5 nM. The best one displayed a superb binding performance toward Np with a Kd value of 0.49 nM. Interestingly, we found that the four pairs of aptamers could bind to Np successively, suggesting a sandwich-type interaction. Using these sandwiched aptamers in ELISA and colloidal gold immunochromatographic strips, we were able to detect Np at the tens of pM level. The results demonstrate that aptamers are powerful molecular tools for virus detection, diagnosis, and antiviral therapy.","Zhang, Liyun; Fang, Xiaona; Liu, Xingbo; Ou, Huichao; Zhang, Haiyan; Wang, Jinjun; Li, Qian; Cheng, Huanyi; Zhang, Wenyi; Luo, Zhaofeng",Chem Commun (Camb),,646
451204,University Students Behavior In Searching And Disseminating COVID-19 Online Information,2020,"COVID-19 greatly impacted nursing education and required nursing faculty and students to quickly adapt to changes caused by disease mitigation. The purpose of this study was to examine the mediating effects of resilience between the influence of demographics and school-related risk factors and nursing faculty and student quality of life (QoL) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A secondary data analysis was conducted using structural equation modeling to examine the mediating role of resilience on latent variables. Resilience had a positive, direct effect on nursing faculty and student QoL. Having a designated home workspace and being well-prepared for online learning had positive, indirect effects on QoL, mediated through resilience. Assisting children with schoolwork had a negative impact on the psychological and environmental QoL domains. Remarkably, having a caregiver role positively influenced the psychological QoL domain. Supporting and promoting faculty and nursing students' health and well-being is imperative during and after the pandemic.","Antill Keener, Tina; Wang, Kesheng; Hall, Katherine; Hulsey, Tara; Piamjariyakul, Ubolrat",West J Nurs Res,,646

451951,"Social Distancing, Safe Spaces and the Demand for Quarantine",2020,"INTRODUCTION: An increasing number of patients are voicing their opinions and expectations about the quality of care in online forums and on physician rating websites (PRWs). This paper analyzes patient online reviews (PORs) to identify emerging and fading topics and sentiment trends in PRWs during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Text data were collected, including 55,612 PORs of 3430 doctors from three popular PRWs in the United States (RateMDs, HealthGrades, and Vitals) from March 01 to June 27, 2020. An improved latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based topic modeling (topic coherence-based LDA [TCLDA]), manual annotation, and sentiment analysis tool were applied to extract a suitable number of topics, generate corresponding keywords, assign topic names, and determine trends in the extracted topics and specific emotions. RESULTS: According to the coherence value and manual annotation, the identified taxonomy includes 30 topics across high-rank and low-rank disease categories. The emerging topics in PRWs focus mainly on themes such as treatment experience, policy implementation regarding epidemic control measures, individuals' attitudes toward the pandemic, and mental health across high-rank diseases. In contrast, the treatment process and experience during COVID-19, awareness and COVID-19 control measures, and COVID-19 deaths, fear, and stress were the most popular themes for low-rank diseases. Panic buying and daily life impact, treatment processes, and bedside manner were the fading themes across high-rank diseases. In contrast, provider attitude toward patients during the pandemic, detection at public transportation, passenger, travel bans and warnings, and materials supplies and society support during COVID-19 were the most fading themes across low-rank diseases. Regarding sentiment analysis, negative emotions (fear, anger, and sadness) prevail during the early wave of the COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Mining topic dynamics and sentiment trends in PRWs may provide valuable knowledge of patients' opinions during the COVID-19 crisis. Policymakers should consider these PORs and develop global healthcare policies and surveillance systems through monitoring PRWs. The findings of this study identify research gaps in the areas of e-health and text mining and offer future research directions.","Shah, Adnan Muhammad; Yan, Xiangbin; Qayyum, Abdul; Naqvi, Rizwan Ali; Shah, Syed Jamal",Int J Med Inform,,646
453049,Teleconsultation will replace most face-to-face interactions in the multiple sclerosis clinic - Commentary,2021,"OBJECTIVE: In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus-infected pneumonia broke out in Wuhan and spread rapidly to other parts of the country. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the confirmed cases of COVID-19, who were admitted to the North Hospital of Changsha first Hospital (Changsha Public Health treatment Center) from January 17 to February 7, 2020. RESULTS: The median age of COVID-19 patients was 45 years (range 33.5-57). The male patients accounted for 49.7%, 64.6% of the patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan, and 31.7% had family aggregation. The median days of onset were six, and the incidence of severe illness was 18.6%. Compared with the non-severe group, the severe group showed statistical significance in older age, hypertension, bilateral lung plaque shadow, decrease in lymphocyte count, increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. CONCLUSIONS: Age, combined hypertension, oxygenation index, double lung patch, decreased lymphocyte count, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase can be used as predictors of the disease severity.","Zheng, F; Tang, W; Li, H; Huang, Y-X; Xie, Y-L; Zhou, Z-G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,646
453261,Impact of COVID-19 on the production and consumption of agricultural food,2021,"BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer are particularly vulnerable to stress and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing is critical for patients with cancer; however, it can also reduce their access to psychosocial coping resources. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore patient experiences to generate a model of how virtual mind-body programs can support the psychosocial well-being of patients with cancer. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study among patients (aged &#8805;18 years) who participated in a virtual mind-body program offered by a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program consisted of mind-body group therapy sessions of fitness, yoga, tai chi, dance therapy, music therapy, and meditation. Live integrative medicine clinicians held each session via Zoom videoconferencing for 30-45 minutes. In semistructured phone interviews (n=30), patients were asked about their overall impressions and perceptions of the benefits of the sessions, including impacts on stress and anxiety. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory. RESULTS: Among the 30 participants (average age 64.5 years, SD 9.36, range 40-80, 29 female), three major themes were identified relating to experiences in the virtual mind-body program: (1) the sessions helped the patients maintain structured routines and motivated them to adhere to healthy behaviors; (2) the sessions enhanced coping with COVID-19-related-stressors, allowing patients to ""refocus"" and ""re-energize""; and (3) the sessions allowed patients to connect, fostering social relationships during a time of isolation. These themes informed the constructs of a novel behavioral-psychological-social coping model for patients with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual mind-body programming supported patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic through a behavioral-psychological-social coping model by enhancing psychological coping for external stressors, supporting adherence to motivation and health behaviors, and increasing social connection and camaraderie. These programs have potential to address the behavioral, psychological, and social challenges faced by patients with cancer during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The constructs of the conceptual model proposed in this study can inform future interventions to support isolated patients with cancer. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm the specific benefits of virtual mind-body programming for the psychosocial well-being and healthy behaviors of patients with cancer.","Emard, Nicholas; Lynch, Kathleen A; Liou, Kevin T; Atkinson, Thomas; Green, Angela K; Daly, Bobby; Trevino, Kelly; Mao, Jun J",JMIR Cancer,,646

464423,The microbiopolitics of a ‘total‐trans‐species’ social institution,2020,"The global outbreak of coronavirus disease and rapid spread of the causative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represent a significant threat to human health. A key mechanism of human SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated by the combination of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2-derived spike glycoprotein. Despite the importance of these protein interactions, there is still insufficient detection methods to observe their activity at the cellular level. Herein, we developed a novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based hACE2 biosensor to monitor the interaction between hACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD. This biosensor facilitated the visualization of hACE2-RBD activity with high spatiotemporal resolutions at the single-cell level. Further studies revealed that the FRET-based hACE2 biosensors were sensitive to both exogenous and endogenous hACE2 expression, suggesting that they might be safely applied to the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection without direct virus use. Therefore, our novel biosensor could potentially help develop drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting hACE2-RBD interaction.","Suh, Jung-Soo; Kim, Heon-Su; Kim, Tae-Jin",Sens Actuators B Chem,,646

465253,Lean on Your Land Grant: One University's Approach to Address the Food Supply Chain Workforce during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Background: Patients with severe COVID-19 develop a life-threatening hyperinflammatory response to the virus. Interleukin (IL)-1 or IL-6 inhibitors have been used to treat this patient population, but the comparative effectiveness of these different strategies remains undetermined. We aimed to compare IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation. Methods: This cohort study included patients admitted to San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and hyperinflammation, defined as serum C-reactive protein concentration of 100 mg/L or more or ferritin concentration of 900 ng/mL or more. The primary endpoint was survival, and the secondary endpoint was a composite of death or mechanical ventilation (adverse clinical outcome). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to compare clinical outcomes of patients receiving IL-1 inhibition (anakinra) or IL-6 inhibition (tocilizumab or sarilumab) with those of patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, after accounting for baseline differences. All patients received standard care. Interaction tests were used to assess the probability of survival according to C-reactive protein or lactate dehydrogenase concentrations. Findings: Of 392 patients included between Feb 25 and May 20, 2020, 275 did not receive interleukin inhibitors, 62 received the IL-1 inhibitor anakinra, and 55 received an IL-6 inhibitor (29 received tocilizumab and 26 received sarilumab). In the multivariable analysis, compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, patients treated with IL-1 inhibition had a significantly reduced mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0·450, 95% CI 0·204-0·990, p=0·047), but those treated with IL-6 inhibition did not (0·900, 0·412-1·966; p=0·79). In the multivariable analysis, there was no difference in adverse clinical outcome risk in patients treated with IL-1 inhibition (HR 0·866, 95% CI 0·482-1·553; p=0·63) or IL-6 inhibition (0·882, 0·452-1·722; p=0·71) relative to patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For increasing C-reactive protein concentrations, patients treated with IL-6 inhibition had a significantly reduced risk of mortality (HR 0·990, 95% CI 0·981-0·999; p=0·031) and adverse clinical outcome (0·987, 0·979-0·995; p=0·0021) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For decreasing concentrations of serum lactate dehydrogenase, patients treated with an IL-1 inhibitor and patients treated with IL-6 inhibitors had a reduced risk of mortality; increasing concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase in patients receiving either interleukin inhibitor were associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR 1·009, 95% CI 1·003-1·014, p=0·0011 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1·006, 1·001-1·011, p=0·028 for IL-6 inhibitors) and adverse clinical outcome (1·006, 1·002-1·010, p=0·0031 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1·005, 1·001-1·010, p=0·016 for IL-6 inhibitors) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. Interpretation: IL-1 inhibition, but not IL-6 inhibition, was associated with a significant reduction of mortality in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation. IL-6 inhibition was effective in a subgroup of patients with markedly high C-reactive protein concentrations, whereas both IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition were effective in patients with low lactate dehydrogenase concentrations.

466333,Health professional students' perceptions and experiences of remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"In this paper, we present Crossing Aggregation Network (CAggNet), a novel densely connected semantic segmentation method for medical image analysis. The crossing aggregation network absorbs the idea of deep layer aggregation and makes significant innovations in layer connection and semantic information fusion. In this architecture, the traditional skip-connection structure of general U-Net is replaced by aggregations of multilevel down-sampling and up-sampling layers. This enables the network to fuse information interactively flows at different levels of layers in semantic segmentation. It also introduces weighted aggregation module to aggregate multi-scale output information. We have evaluated and compared our CAggNet with several advanced U-Net based methods in two public medical image datasets, including the 2018 Data Science Bowl nuclei detection dataset and the 2015 MICCAI gland segmentation competition dataset. Experimental results indicate that CAggNet improves medical object recognition and achieves a more accurate and efficient segmentation compared to existing improved U-Net and UNet++ structure.","Cao, Xu; Lin, Yanghao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08237v1.pdf,646

However, there is huge heterogeneity among individuals in their willingness to wear face masks during an epidemic. This research aims to investigate the individual heterogeneity to wear face masks and its associated predictors during the COVID-19 pandemic when mask-wearing was not mandatory but individuals choices. Based on a survey of 708 Malaysian adults and a multivariate least-squares fitting analysis, the results reveal a significant variance among individuals in wearing masks, as 34% of the individual adults did not always wear masks in public places. Female, individuals who wash their hands more frequently, and those who reported more availability of personal protective equipment were more likely to practice mask-wearing. The identification of less compliant groups of mask-wearing has critical implications by enabling more specific health communication campaigns.","Zhang, Stephen X.; Looi, Kim Hoe; Li, Nicolas; Jizhen, LI; Wan, Xue",,,646

469208,Secondary Mathematics Teachers’ Perception of Their Readiness for Emergency Remote Teaching during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study,2021,"Modern kernel-based two-sample tests have shown great success in distinguishing complex, high-dimensional distributions with appropriate learned kernels. Previous work has demonstrated that this kernel learning procedure succeeds, assuming a considerable number of observed samples from each distribution. In realistic scenarios with very limited numbers of data samples, however, it can be challenging to identify a kernel powerful enough to distinguish complex distributions. We address this issue by introducing the problem of meta two-sample testing (M2ST), which aims to exploit (abundant) auxiliary data on related tasks to find an algorithm that can quickly identify a powerful test on new target tasks. We propose two specific algorithms for this task: a generic scheme which improves over baselines and amore tailored approach which performs even better. We provide both theoretical justification and empirical evidence that our proposed meta-testing schemes out-perform learning kernel-based tests directly from scarce observations, and identify when such schemes will be successful.","Liu, Feng; Xu, Wenkai; Lu, Jie; Sutherland, Danica J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07636v1.pdf,646

Despite its aggressive extension and significant morbidity and mortality, risk factors are poorly characterized outside China. We designed a registry, HOPE COVID-19 (NCT04334291), assessing data of 1021 patients discharged (dead or alive) after COVID-19, from 23 hospitals in 4 countries, between 8 February and 1 April. The primary end-point was all-cause mortality aiming to produce a mortality risk score calculator. The median age was 68 years (IQR 52-79), and 59.5% were male. Most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (46.8%) and dyslipidemia (35.8%). A relevant heart or lung disease were depicted in 20%. And renal, neurological, or oncological disease, respectively, were detected in nearly 10%. Most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea at admission. 311 patients died and 710 were discharged alive. In the death-multivariate analysis, raised as most relevant: age, hypertension, obesity, renal insufficiency, any immunosuppressive disease, 02 saturation < 92% and an elevated C reactive protein (AUC = 0.87; Hosmer-Lemeshow test, p > 0.999; bootstrap-optimist: 0.0018). We provide a simple clinical score to estimate probability of death, dividing patients in four grades (I-IV) of increasing probability. Hydroxychloroquine (79.2%) and antivirals (67.6%) were the specific drugs most commonly used. After a propensity score adjustment, the results suggested a slight improvement in mortality rates (adjusted-ORhydroxychloroquine 0.88; 95% CI 0.81-0.91, p = 0.005; adjusted-ORantiviral 0.94; 95% CI 0.87-1.01; p = 0.115). COVID-19 produces important mortality, mostly in patients with comorbidities with respiratory symptoms. Hydroxychloroquine could be associated with survival benefit, but this data need to be confirmed with further trials.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted over 50 hospitals in China. Descriptive analyses and Chi-square tests were performed on the collected data. RESULTS: All 104 frontline HCPs report negative impacts of PPE on their clinical performance, 97% of them experienced discomfort and injuries caused by wearing PPE for long hours. Frontline HCPs provided suggestions to alleviate the negative impacts and to enhance communication between healthcare staff and patients. Two hundred eighty two non-frontline HCPs also revealed similar problems; however, we recorded a few discrepancies between answers given by frontline and non-frontline HCPs. CONCLUSIONS: Wearing PPE for long hours degrades health performance. Measures were suggested to improve the design of PPE for protecting HCPs and enhancing their services to COVID patients.","Duan, Xiaoqin; Sun, Hongzhi; He, Yuxuan; Yang, Junling; Li, Xinming; Taparia, Kritika; Zheng, Bin",J Occup Environ Med,,646

New York alone has more than 333,000 cases and nearly 21,271 deaths. As we are trying to reopen our economies, the biggest risk we face is a surge in the immediate cases of new infections. The second wave of infection in the fall has also been predicted. As per the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) latest data set, among the dead from SARS COV-2 in the USA, 80% were 65 years or older. Despite lower percentages of people living in nursing homes and the fact that they represented only 11% of total cases of SARS CoV-2 cases, the maximum death rate has been seen there. A staggering 27,700 people died in long-term facilities in the USA as per the database by the New York Times. These deaths accounted for one-third of the deaths related to SARS CoV-2, making it the most intensively hurt group of al. lThe ground reality is that unfortunately, even now, most of these facilities do not have enough tests that can stop the outbreak. We suggest special targeting of residents of long-term care facilities, and the HCPs involved in these facilities to stop the spread of SARS CoV-2. Extreme measures including the highest testing numbers should be allocated to these facilities and rigorous Infection control measures should be undertaken so that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not enter and infect the patients in these facilities and if it does, it is limited to the facility.","Singh, Harpreet; Popli, Tarun",Adv Respir Med,,646

Regarding Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), few programs have been tested; nevertheless, results are promising. The therapeutic alliance is an important factor predicting treatment outcome in BPD. However, we do not know yet to what extent BPD patients form a therapeutic alliance with an eHealth tool and how this relationship differs from the relationship with their human therapist. This study aims to address this question using priovi, an interactive schema therapy-based eHealth tool for BPD. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore how patients perceived the therapeutic alliance with priovi and its differences compared to the alliance with their human therapist (N = 9). Interview data were analyzed following the procedures of qualitative content analysis. Additionally, the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI-SR) was administered in two versions (regarding the human therapist and priovi, N = 16) every three months during the treatment phase of one year. Results indicate that patients were able to form a good therapeutic relationship with priovi, but it differed from the relationship to their human therapist. Important categories were ""priovi is helpful, supportive and always there"" and ""priovi is less flexible"". WAI ratings for the task subscale were high in both relationships but significantly higher in WAItherapist compared to WAIpriovi in two measurements (nine-months measurement: t = 2.76, df = 15, p = 0.015; twelve-months measurement: t = 3.44, df = 15, p = 0.004). These results indicate that BPD patients can form a functioning alliance with an eHealth program and that eHealth programs may be especially useful for psychoeducation and cognitive exercises.","Köhne, Sandra; Schweiger, Ulrich; Jacob, Gitta A; Braakmann, Diana; Klein, Jan Philipp; Borgwardt, Stefan; Assmann, Nele; Rogg, Mirco; Schaich, Anja; Faßbinder, Eva",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,646

Although antibodies that block this interaction are in emergency use as early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapies, the precise determinants of neutralization potency remain unknown. We discovered a series of antibodies that potently block ACE2 binding but exhibit divergent neutralization efficacy against the live virus. Strikingly, these neutralizing antibodies can inhibit or enhance Spike-mediated membrane fusion and formation of syncytia, which are associated with chronic tissue damage in individuals with COVID-19. As revealed by cryoelectron microscopy, multiple structures of Spike-antibody complexes have distinct binding modes that not only block ACE2 binding but also alter the Spike protein conformational cycle triggered by ACE2 binding. We show that stabilization of different Spike conformations leads to modulation of Spike-mediated membrane fusion with profound implications for COVID-19 pathology and immunity.","Asarnow, Daniel; Wang, Bei; Lee, Wen-Hsin; Hu, Yuanyu; Huang, Ching-Wen; Faust, Bryan; Ng, Patricia Miang Lon; Ngoh, Eve Zi Xian; Bohn, Markus; Bulkley, David; Pizzorno, Andrés; Ary, Beatrice; Tan, Hwee Ching; Lee, Chia Yin; Minhat, Rabiatul Adawiyah; Terrier, Olivier; Soh, Mun Kuen; Teo, Frannie Jiuyi; Yeap, Yvonne Yee Chin; Seah, Shirley Gek Kheng; Chan, Conrad En Zuo; Connelly, Emily; Young, Nicholas J; Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian; Renia, Laurent; Hanson, Brendon John; Rosa-Calatrava, Manuel; Manglik, Aashish; Cheng, Yifan; Craik, Charles S; Wang, Cheng-I",Cell,,646

Such systems have also been used in Pakistan, particularly in private sector, for university and school education. This paper attempts to highlight various issues that the students are facing and the factors that have a significant effect on their online learning experience. We collected data through online questionnaires distributed to 1200 students enrolled in six private universities in Pakistan. This study employed the Structure Equation Modelling (SEM) to examine factors that influenced online learning. The results showed that teaching and professional behaviour, course instructional planning and methodology and online connectivity were significantly positively associated with online learning. With the identification of key factors that affects online learning of students, it will be more helpful to provide improved services for effective student leaning.

In birds, the majority of the known CoVs belong to the Gammacoronavirus genus, whilst a small number are classified as Deltacoronaviruses. Gammacoronaviruses continue to be reported in an increasing number of avian species, generally by detection of viral RNA. Apart from infectious bronchitis virus in chickens, the only avian species in which CoV has been definitively associated with disease are the turkey, pheasant and guinea fowl. Whilst there is strong evidence for recombination between gammacoronaviruses of different avian species, and between betacoronaviruses in different mammals, evidence of recombination between coronaviruses of different genera is lacking. Furthermore, the recombination of an alpha or betacoronavirus with a gammacoronavirus is extremely unlikely. For recombination to happen, the two viruses would need to be present in the same cell of the same animal at the same time, a highly unlikely scenario as they cannot replicate in the same host!","de Wit, J J Sjaak; Cook, Jane K A",Avian Pathol,,646

During the first wave, Theo Meder and Mathijs Kroon did some intensive collecting of jokes, memes, fake news, and conspiracy theories. It was expected by folktale researchers like Giselinde Kuipers and Theo Meder that, just like in former crises, jokes would contain plenty of morbid disaster humor, but that did not happen. Contemporary legends, on the other hand, were polarizing and toxic, and mistrust was mainly directed against the elite of politicians, scientists, doctors, and journalists.

Because of ""shelter-in-place orders,"" there were no visitors permitted at the bedside, yet we know that high-quality poststroke education is important to improve outcomes. The purpose of this reflections article is to share what has worked at my institution. INNOVATIONS: We found that calling family members to engage them in stroke education was a great option. They seemed engaged, took notes, and asked questions. Nurses document details from these phone encounters in the patient's medical record. Many people placed the call on speaker so other family members could listen to the education session. While family members were at home, telehealth nursing has its own set of challenges. Although telehealth is not a perfect solution, it was one we found most reasonable and found it to work well through this unprecedented time.

Despite the improvement of information and communications technology (ICT), Italian medical doctors' (MDs) education system seems inadequate in this area. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, societies are waking up to their limitations. The aim of this paper is to analyze the Italian status quo in DH. METHODS: The Italian Young Medical Doctors Association (Segretariato Italiano Giovani Medici - SIGM) proposed a web-based survey to assess DH awareness and previous knowledge among young doctors. Investigated areas were: big data, -omics technology and predictive models, artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things, telemedicine, social media, blockchain and clinical-data storage. RESULTS: A total of 362 participants answered to the survey. Only 13% had experience in big data during clinical or research activities, 13% in -omics technology and predictive models, 13% in AI, 6% had experience in internet of things, 22% experienced at least one telemedicine tool and 23% of the participants declared that during their clinical activities data collection was paper-driven.

The world has seen mounting infections and deaths over the past few months despite the unprecedented measures countries are implementing, such as lockdowns, social distancing, mask-wearing, and banning gatherings in large groups. Interestingly, young individuals seem less likely to be impacted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19. While the rate of transmission, symptom presentation, and fatality is lower in children than people from other age groups, they have been disproportionately affected by strict lockdown measures needed to curb viral spread. In this review, we describe the association between patient age and COVID-19, epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, psychological effects associated with lockdowns and school closures, and possible mechanisms underlying lower transmission rate of COVID-19 in children.","Manivannan, Madhumitha; Jogalekar, Manasi P; Kavitha, Muthu Subash; Maran, Balu Alagar Venmathi; Gangadaran, Prakash",Exp Biol Med (Maywood),,646

Our study describes the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to ICU in the largest health care system in the state of Florida, United States. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to ICU due to severe COVID-19 in AdventHealth health system in Orlando, Florida from March 11th until May 18th, 2020. Patients were characterized based on demographics, baseline comorbidities, severity of illness, medical management including experimental therapies, laboratory markers and ventilator parameters. Major clinical outcomes analyzed at the end of the study period were: hospital and ICU length of stay, MV-related mortality and overall hospital mortality of ICU patients. RESULTS: Out of total of 1283 patients with COVID-19, 131 (10.2%) met criteria for ICU admission (median age: 61 years [interquartile range (IQR), 49.5-71.5]; 35.1% female). Common comorbidities were hypertension (84; 64.1%), and diabetes (54; 41.2%). Of the 131 ICU patients, 109 (83.2%) required MV and 9 (6.9%) received ECMO. Lower positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) were observed in survivors [9.2 (7.7-10.4)] vs non-survivors [10 (9.1-12.9] p = 0.004]. Compared to non-survivors, survivors had a longer MV length of stay (LOS) [14 (IQR 8-22) vs 8.5 (IQR 5-10.8) p< 0.001], Hospital LOS [21 (IQR 13-31) vs 10 (7-1) p< 0.001] and ICU LOS [14 (IQR 7-24) vs 9.5 (IQR 6-11), p < 0.001]. The overall hospital mortality and MV-related mortality were 19.8% and 23.8% respectively. After exclusion of hospitalized patients, the hospital and MV-related mortality rates were 21.6% and 26.5% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates an important improvement in mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 who required ICU admission and MV in comparison to previous observational reports and emphasizes the importance of standard of care measures in the management of COVID-19.","Oliveira, Eduardo; Parikh, Amay; Lopez-Ruiz, Arnaldo; Carrilo, Maria; Goldberg, Joshua; Cearras, Martin; Fernainy, Khaled; Andersen, Sonja; Mercado, Luis; Guan, Jian; Zafar, Hammad; Louzon, Patricia; Carr, Amy; Baloch, Natasha; Pratley, Richard; Silverstry, Scott; Hsu, Vincent; Sniffen, Jason; Herrera, Victor; Finkler, Neil",PLoS One,,646

This study retrospectively explored the clinical significance of peripheral lymphocytes, especially the dynamic analysis of T-cell subsets, in determining coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and progression. Seventy-nine patients with COVID-19 in the Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu from January to February 2020 were included, 59 of which were analyzed for dynamic peripheral T-cell subsets expression. The neutrophil to CD4+ T lymphocyte ratio (N4R) and neutrophil to CD3+ T lymphocyte ratio (N3R) showed clinical significance in differentiating severe or critically-severe COVID-19, with area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.933 and 0.900, respectively (P < 0.05). COVID-19 patients with more baseline peripheral lymphocytes or NK cells were prone to test negative to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after therapy (P < 0.05), and the AUC of NK cells for predicting negative results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection after therapy was 0.800. When the number of peripheral CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients continuously increased 6-9 days after baseline, the period of disease exacerbation could be delayed for more than 2 weeks after admission. Baseline N4R and N3R could be potential biomarkers for assisting in differentiating COVID-19 severity, and dynamically monitoring peripheral CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells 6-9 days after baseline could help clinicians to evaluate disease progression in COVID-19 patients.","Meng, Liye; Xu, Jiao; Zhang, Junlong; Zhang, Keyi; Shang, Pengcheng; Li, Qingfeng; Li, Yi; Wang, Lanlan; Cai, Bei",Aging (Albany NY),,646

However, it also implied that many patients were not screened and therefore had no accurate diagnosis. In this study, we carried out a population-based SARS-CoV-2 screening in Mexico to evaluate the COVID-19-related symptoms and their weighting in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discuss this data in the context of the operational definition of suspected cases of COVID-19 established by the Mexican Health Authority's consensus. Materials and Methods: One thousand two hundred seventy-nine subjects were included. They were screened for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR. The weighting of COVID-19 symptoms in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated statistically. Results: Three hundred and twenty-five patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 954 were negative. Fever, asthenia, dysgeusia, and oxygen saturation predicted SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratios ranged from 1.74 to 4.98; p < 0.05). The percentage of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was 36% and only 38.15% met the Mexican operational definition. Cq-values for the gene N of SARS-CoV-2 were significantly higher in asymptomatic subjects than in the groups of COVID-19 patients with neurological, respiratory, and/or musculoskeletal manifestations (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Dysgeusia, fever, and asthenia increased the odds of a positive result for COVID-19 1.74-4.98-fold among the study population. Patients with neurological, respiratory, and/or musculoskeletal manifestations had higher viral loads at COVID-19 diagnosis than those observed in asymptomatic patients. A high percentage of the participants in the study (61.85%) did not meet the operational definition for a suspected case of COVID-19 established by the Mexican Health Authority's consensus, representing a high percentage of the population that could have remained without a COVID-19 diagnosis, so becoming a potential source of virus spread.","Martinez-Fierro, Margarita L; Diaz-Lozano, Martha; Alvarez-Zuñiga, Claudia; Ramirez-Hernandez, Leticia A; Araujo-Espino, Roxana; Trejo-Ortiz, Perla M; Mollinedo-Montaño, Fabiana E; Ortiz-Castro, Yolanda; Vazquez-Reyes, Sodel; Velasco-Elizondo, Perla; Garcia-Esquivel, Lidia; Araujo-Conejo, Arturo; Garza-Veloz, Idalia",Medicina (Kaunas),,646

A scientific and methodological approach to the study of the vector and specifics of the development of e-commerce and m-commerce is formed given the lack of necessary statistical information to assess the state of e-commerce in a country and linguistic features of definitions. The influence of e-commerce and m-commerce on the online shopping and sales industry has been established. The global distribution of Internet sources used by consumers, global sales in m-commerce as a percentage of e-commerce and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on online traffic and changes in transactions by industry are analyzed. The transition of e-commerce to m-commerce was revealed as a result of the increase in the share of mobile transactions in view of the development of markets in countries focused primarily on mobile devices and their active use. As a result of the post-pandemic forecast in the trends of international trade and e-business priorities, a promising increase in world sales in e-commerce has been established. The main trends of further development of e-commerce and m-commerce in the field of international trade are identified, such as: big data, personalization, e-mail marketing, transition of e-commerce to e-commerce, ordering services online and transition of retail to online, electronic public procurement, omnichannel and multichannel, socially oriented commerce, improved work with the community and the need for efficient logistics. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

510534,Measuring sustainability in healthcare: an analysis of two systems providing insoles to patients with diabetes,2020,"More than a century of research has shown that sociodemographic conditions affect infectious disease transmission. In the late spring and early summer of 2020, reports of the effects of sociodemographic variables on the spread of COVID-19 were used in the media with minimal scientific proof attached. With new cases of COVID-19 surging in the United States at that time, it became essential to better understand how the spread of COVID-19 was varying across all segments of the population. We used hierarchical exponential growth curve modeling techniques to examine whether community socioeconomic characteristics uniquely influence the incidence of reported COVID-19 cases in the urban built environment. We show that as of July 19, 2020, confirmed coronavirus infections in New York City and surrounding areas-one of the early epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States-were concentrated along demographic and socioeconomic lines. Furthermore, our data provides evidence that after the onset of the pandemic, timely enactment of physical distancing measures such as school closures was essential to limiting the extent of the coronavirus spread in the population. We conclude that in a pandemic, public health authorities must impose physical distancing measures early on as well as consider community-level factors that associate with a greater risk of viral transmission.","Kranjac, Ashley Wendell; Kranjac, Dinko",Health Secur,,646

METHODS: The study was conducted at Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) in Qatar, a national healthcare system with 14 hospitals and >28,000 employees, between March 10 and June 24, 2020. Data on COVID-19+ HCWs were retrieved from the electronic health records and employment records, followed by an email survey and a focused telephone interview. RESULTS: Among 16,912 HCWs tested, 10.6% tested positive. Hospitalization rate was 11.6%, 1.3% required supplemental oxygen, 0.6% needed intensive care unit admission, and 0.3% required mechanical ventilation. There were no deaths. In a follow-up survey of 393 HCWs, 5% reported acquiring infection at a COVID-19-designated facility and 95% at a non-COVID-19 facility having acquired the infection through accidental exposure to a colleague (45%) or a patient (29%). Full personal protective equipment (PPE) adherence was 82% at COVID-19-designated facilities but only 68% at non-COVID-19 facilities. CONCLUSIONS: COVID- 19 infection among HCWs often occurs among those not directly working with COVID-19 patients. PPE use is less stringent in such settings. Risk of exposure and need for strict PPE must be stressed upon all HCWs in all settings.","Alajmi, Jameela; Jeremijenko, Andrew M; Abraham, Joji C; Alishaq, Moza; Concepcion, Elli Gabriel; Butt, Adeel Ajwad; Abou-Samra, Abdul-Badi",Int J Infect Dis,,646

The pharmaceuticals containing methionine with paracetamol may contribute to avoid hepatotoxicity and eventual paracetamol overdose-dependent death. OBJECTIVE: The current work purposes to develop and validate two chromatographic methods for the simultaneous determination of methionine and paracetamol in presence of two paracetamol impurities (4-nitrophenol and 4-aminophenol). METHODS: Two chromatographic methods were established and validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. The first one was a RP-HPLC/UV method based on applying a ""dual-mode"" gradient elution. The separation was realized via varying both the composition of the ternary mobile phase (acetonitrile-methanol-water) and its flow rate. This strategy enabled a relatively rapid analysis with a satisfactory resolution, although the investigated compounds exhibit a significant difference in lipophilicity. The second one relied on TLC- densitometry, where the optimum separation was realized using a quaternary mobile phase system composed of butanol-dioxane-toluene-methanol (8: 2.5: 3.5: 0.3, by volume). Both methods were monitored at 220 nm. RESULTS: The developed methods were proven to be robust, accurate, specific, and appropriate for the routine analysis of paracetamol in its pure form or in pharmaceutical formulations with methionine in quality control laboratories. CONCLUSIONS: The corresponding methods are suitable to determine methionine and paracetamol in the presence of paracetamol impurities. HIGHLIGHTS: The study achieves the analysis of methionine and paracetamol in the presence of paracetamol impurities via the application of HPLC and TLC- densitometry methods.","Ibrahim, Hany; Hamdy, Abdallah M; Merey, Hanan A; Saad, Ahmed S",J.

512841,Diagnosis of covid-19 using optimized pca based local binary pattern features,2021,"The aim of this article is to explore the impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on primate-related conservation work. The withdrawal of primatologists and conservation staff from field research can lead to a number of detrimental effects not just on conservation but also on local communities in low- and middle-income countries. Inequalities in access to health and financial insecurities may be drivers for the illegal wildlife trade and the lack of tourism and research activity may allow poachers to work with greater ease. The paper also looks at how conservation organizations and research bodies should modify their field protocols by developing robust occupational health policies that will not only make field work safer but also support local staff as they are likely to face the greatest threats to their physical health, psychological health, and economic loss from COVID-19.

In these studies, the RP2.1 panel had 98 % positive percent agreement (48/49) and 100 % negative percent agreement (49/49). Since 30 % of nasopharyngeal swab specimens have a SARS CoV-2 Ct >30 and thus detection of virus in low titers is clinically relevant, a sample with a high titer was diluted and each 10 fold dilution was tested in triplicate and compared against 6 other EUA approved SARS CoV-2 assays. These data suggested that the BioFire® RP2.1 panel, along with four other SARS CoV-2 assays (Roche cobas, Cepheid Xpert Xpress, BioFire® Defense COVID19, and NECoV19), consistently detected viral RNA at the 10-7 dilution. Overall, these studies suggest that the BioFire® RP2.1 assay can be used to detect acute cases of SARS CoV2 in addition to patients with low viral titer later in disease presentation.","Creager, Hannah M; Cabrera, Barbara; Schnaubelt, Andy; Cox, Jesse L; Cushman-Vokoun, Allison M; Shakir, Salika M; Tardif, Keith D; Huang, Meei-Li; Jerome, Keith R; Greninger, Alexander L; Drobysheva, Daria; Spaulding, Usha; Rogatcheva, Margarita; Bourzac, Kevin M; Hinrichs, S H; Broadhurst, M J; Fey, P D",J Clin Virol,,646

515910,The analysis of self directed learning (SDL) through Rasch modeling: Case study on prospective teachers during the use of e-learning with HOTS-oriented in the period of Covid-19 pandemic,2021,"Background: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted life around the globe and has the potential to seriously impact alcohol consumption for individuals experiencing social isolation and pandemic-related stress. Evidence from prior epidemics suggests increased alcohol consumption during quarantine and times of high stress are associated with a greater chance of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD). This study examines alcohol sales data to ascertain how individuals are interacting with alcohol during the pandemic.Materials and method: Monthly off premises alcohol sales data for select US alcoholic beverage control states were used to construct monthly sales patterns from 2015 to 2020. An independent samples t-test was used to determine if COVID-19 era alcohol sales were higher than those that occurred from 2015 to 2019.Results: Alcohol sales from March to August 2020 were significantly higher than sales from the same span of months from 2015 to 2019 (t=-2.47, p<.05). The associated monthly percentage increase in sales ranged from 14 to 44% with the overall trend indicating a move toward pre-pandemic sales totals.Conclusion: As COVID-19 continues to disrupt typical ways of being across the globe, the implications of increased sales of alcohol should not be overlooked. Taken together, the evidence on increased use during isolation and later AUD diagnosis coupled with the ABC state sales figures here, point to a potential increase in the development of AUD and an increase in alcohol-related harms.","Morton, Cory M",Subst Abus,,646

Mobility statistics are a relatively new data source created by compiling smartphone location data; they can be effectively used for understanding pandemics if integrated with epidemiological findings and other economic data sets. Based on data for the first wave of infections in Japan, we found that reductions targeting the hospitality industry were slightly more effective than restrictions on general business activities. Specifically, we found that to hold back the pandemic (that is, to reduce the effective reproduction number to one or less for all days), a 20%-35% reduction in weekly mobility is required, depending on the region. A lesser goal, 80% of days with one or less observed transmission, can be achieved with a 6%-30% reduction in weekly mobility. These are the results if other potential causes of spread are ignored; for a fuller picture, more careful observations, expanded data sets, and advanced statistical modeling are needed.","Kajitani, Yoshio; Hatayama, Michinori",PLoS One,,646

Applying Foucault's (1979) notion of the panopticon, with its twin focus on surveillance and self-regulation, as the preeminent form of social control in modern societies, we examine the increasing levels of surveillance enacted during this pandemic and how people have participated in, and extended, this surveillance, self-regulation, and social control through the use of digital media. Consideration is given to how such surveillance may serve public health needs and/or political interests and whether the rapid deployment of these extensive surveillance mechanisms risks normalizing these measures so that they become more acceptable and then entrenched post-COVID-19.","Couch, Danielle L; Robinson, Priscilla; Komesaroff, Paul A",J. bioeth. inq,,646

Collective forgetting is the process by which the attention received by cultural pieces decays as time passes. Recent work modeled this decay as the result of two different processes, one linked to communicative memory --memories sustained by human communication-- and cultural memory --memories sustained by the physical recording of content. Yet, little is known on how the collective forgetting dynamic changes over time. Are older cultural pieces forgotten at a lower rate than newer ones? Here, we study the temporal changes of collective memory and attention by focusing on two knowledge communities: inventors and physicists. We use data on patents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and physics papers published in the American Physical Society (APS) to quantify how collective forgetting has changed over time. The model enables us to distinguish between two branches of forgetting. One branch is short-lived, going directly from communicative memory to oblivion. The other one is long-lived going from communicative to cultural memory and then to oblivion. The data analysis shows an increasing forgetting rate for both communities as the information grows. Furthermore, these knowledge communities seem to be increasing their selectivity at storing valuable cultural pieces in their cultural memory. These findings provide empirical confirmation on the forgetting as an annulment hypothesis and show that knowledge communities can effectively slow down the rising of collective forgetting at improving their cultural selectivity.","Candia, Cristian; Uzzi, Brian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06592v1.pdf,646

The nonlinear (asymmetric) relationship is investigated between CO2 emission and COVID-19 with its specific determinants. The positive and negative asymmetries of COVID-19 determinants are also captured by using econometric techniques. The daily data series of CO2 emission, new confirmed cases, confirmed deaths, and lockdown as dummy variables from January 30, 2020, to December 1, 2020, for India is analyzed by employing the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model. This research revealed a significant nonlinear relationship between CO2 emission and COVID-19. The bound test and asymmetric coefficients are confirmed by the variables' long- and short-run relationships. The dynamic multiplier graphs present that India's strict lockdown due to the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients significantly reduces toxic gas emissions, especially CO2 emissions. This asymmetric relationship has been proficiently declared that unhealthy public routine, extra traffic, and unhygienic gases released in the air become the reason for environmental destruction. The lockdown is practically imposed for specific periods and reasons, contributing to reducing toxic emissions, but it is not a permanent solution for environmental sustainability. The government of India, policymakers, and environmentalists should make people aware of unhealthy and environmentally envying activities and policies and long-term applicable strategies should be designed to upgrade the environment's quality.","Sarfraz, Muddassar; Mohsin, Muhammad; Naseem, Sobia; Kumar, Amit",Environ Dev Sustain,,646

Methods: We identified COVID-19 patients who admitted to Xiangyang No. 1 People's Hospital and presented with gastrointestinal symptoms as their initial or main symptoms. Their medical records were reviewed by two independent clinical scientists. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics as well as the clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results: Among 142 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 7 (4.9%) of them presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. Three patients had gastrointestinal symptoms as the initial symptoms and chief complaints, and 4 patients as the main symptoms during disease progression. Six patients had symptoms of diarrhea (3–16 days), 7 with anorexia (7–22 days), 6 with upper abdominal discomfort (1–7 days), and 4 with nausea (1–7 days), 1 with heartburn lasting 2 days, and 2 with vomiting symptoms (1 day). The chest CT scan showed typical COVID-19 imaging features, and associated with the progression of the disease. During treatment, 2 patients died due to organ failure. Discussion: COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms are relatively rare and might be misdiagnosed. The clinical features include watery stools, anorexia, and upper abdominal discomfort. These patients may have severe disease and be associated with a poor prognosis. The underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 related gastrointestinal symptoms need to clarify in future studies.","Ai, Jin-Wei; Zi, Hao; Wang, Yong; Huang, Qiao; Wang, Na; Li, Lu-Yao; Pei, Bin; Ji, Jianguang; Zeng, Xian-Tao",Front.

CRF, along with muscle function and bone and joint health is related to functional independence and a higher quality of life. Wasserman and colleagues proposed a gear model illustrating the integrated role of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and skeletal muscle systems during aerobic exercise; in 2015, a revision to the original model was proposed. Our understanding of the effects and challenges associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rapidly evolving. Initial evidence indicates higher levels of CRF, and muscle function protect individuals infected with COVID-19 from a complicated medical course. Moreover, for those individuals infected with COVID-19, there are initial signs of a reduction in CRF following the initial phase of recovery. We are also gaining an understanding of long COVID syndrome, where individuals who have recovered from the acute phase of viral infection present with lasting symptoms, which include but are not limited to reduced CRF, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Clearly, these individuals will require rehabilitation to restore and/or improve CRF, muscle function, bone and joint health, functional capacity (ie, the ability to perform activities of daily living), and quality of life. The importance of assessing the synergistic function of systems essential to performing activities that require physical exertion is a health care imperative. This graphical narrative provides an update to the gear model initially proposed by Wasserman and updated to a gear and circuit in 2015. External CRF, muscle function, and bone and joint health influencers and an approach to clinical assessment are also introduced.","Arena, Ross; Myers, Jonathan; Ozemek, Cemal; Hall, Grenita; Severin, Richard; Laddu, Deepika; Kaminsky, Leonard A; Stoner, Lee; Conners, Ryan T; Faghy, Mark A",Curr Probl Cardiol,,646

We investigated the combination of rapid antigen detection (RAD) and RT-qPCR assays in a stepwise procedure to optimize the detection of COVID-19. Methods: From August 2020 to November 2020, 43,399 patients were screened in our laboratory for COVID-19 diagnostic by RTqPCR using nasopharyngeal swab. Overall, 4,691 of the 43,399 were found to be positive, and 200 were retrieved for RAD testing allowing comparison of diagnostic accuracy between RAD and RT-qPCR. Cycle threshold (Ct) and time from symptoms onset (TSO) were included as covariates. Results: The overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR-, and LR+ of RAD compared with RT-qPCR were 72% (95%CI 62%;81%), 99% (95% CI95%;100%), 99% (95%CI 93%;100%), and 78% (95%CI 70%;85%), 0.28 (95%CI 0.21;0.39), and 72 (95%CI 10;208) respectively. Sensitivity was higher for patients with Ct [≤] 25 regardless of TSO: TSO [≤] 4 days 92% (95%CI 75%;99%), TSO > 4 days 100% (95%CI 54%;100%), and asymptomatic 100% (95%CI 78%;100%). Overall, combining RAD and RT-qPCR would allow reducing from only 4% the number of RT-qPCR needed. Conclusions: This study highlights the risk of misdiagnosing COVID-19 in 28% of patients if RAD is used alone. Thus, negative results from RAD needs to be confirmed by RT-qPCR prior to making treatment decisions. A stepwise analysis that combines RAD and RT-qPCR would be an efficient screening procedure for COVID-19 detection and may facilitate the control of the outbreak.","HALFON, P.; PENARANDA, G.; KHIRI, H.; GARCIA, V.; DROUET, H.; PHILIBERT, P.; PSOMAS, C.; DELORD, M.; ALLEMAND-SOURRIEU, J.; RETORNAZ, F.; CHARPIN, C.; Gonzales, T.; PEGLIASCO, H.; ALLARDET-SERVENT, J.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.13.21249254; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249254v1?rss=1,646

Electronic searches of MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus were conducted on the 3 June 2019. A total of 804 publications were identified, of which 11 met the inclusion criteria and were, therefore, included in this study. All the included studies were in vitro studies investigating various human cells. The current review found that zoledronic acid in various concentrations increased apoptosis and decreased migration and proliferation of epithelial cells, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, endothelial cells and dental pulp stem cells, which can affect local tissue homeostasis. The consequences of zoledronic acid were found to be both time- and dose-dependent. The pathophysiology of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw is likely a multifactorial process involving prolonged wound healing, chronic inflammation and altered bone remodelling following the administration of zoledronic acid.

We sought to estimate carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions associated with travel for general surgery residency interviews in Canada, and the potential avoided emissions if interviews were restructured. METHODS: An eight-item survey was constructed to collect data on cities visited, travel modalities, and costs incurred. Applicants to the University of Ottawa General Surgery Program during the 2019/20 Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) cycle were invited to complete the survey. Potential reductions in CO(2) emissions were modeled using a regionalized interview process with either one or two cities. RESULTS: Of a total of 56 applicants, 39 (70%) completed the survey. Applicants on average visited 10 cities with a mean total cost of $4,866 (95% CI=3,995-5,737) per applicant. Mean CO(2) emissions were 1.82 (95% CI=1.50-2.14) tonnes per applicant, and the total CO(2) emissions by applicants was estimated to be 101.9 (95% CI=84.0 – 119.8) tonnes. In models wherein interviews are regionalized to one or two cities, emissions would be 57.9 tonnes (43.2% reduction) and 84.2 tonnes (17.4% reduction), respectively. Overall, 74.4% of respondents were concerned about the environmental impact of travel and 46% would prefer to interview by videoconference. CONCLUSION: Travel for general surgery residency interviews in Canada is associated with a considerable environmental impact. These findings are likely generalizable to other residency programs. Given the global climate crisis, the CaRMS application process must consider alternative structures.","Fung, Benjamin SC; Raiche, Isabelle; Lamb, Tyler; Gawad, Nada; MacNeill, Andrea J; Moloo, Husein",Can Med Educ J,https://doi.org/10.36834/cmej.71022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34249187/,646

La definición de caso evaluada sigue siendo una alternativa rentable para identificar a los pacientes que pueden beneficiarse de los medicamentos antivirales específicos contra la influenza, incluso durante el brote mundial de COVID-19. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the performance, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, of the case definition of suspected influenza used in community surveillance in Mexico. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of a cohort study took place and cases fulfilling the suspected case criteria (n = 20,511), and with laboratory-conclusive evidence (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) to confirm or discard influenza virus infection, were analyzed. Results: A high sensitivity and modest specificity were documented, and this later decreased during the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as its diagnostic accuracy. However, no significant differences were observed in the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics among the analyzed periods. Conclusions: The evaluated case definition remains to be a cost-effective alternative to identify patients who may benefit from influenza-specific antiviral drugs, even during the COVID-19 global outbreak.","Murillo-Zamora, E; Hernández-Suárez, C",Rev Clin Esp,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024341/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rce.2020.09.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014256520302344?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014256520302344,646

Perceptions and Experiences of Award-Winning K-6 Teachers,2021-09-24,"Introduction Increased virulence, the severity of illness, and mortality have all been hypothesized with respect to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Our study aims to assess whether ACEi/ARB use in patients with COVID-19 conferred worsened severity of illness or increased mortality. Additionally, we explore the possibility of an unearthed protective benefit due to their interruption of the RAS signaling pathway as observed in cardiovascular diseases. Methods The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched for studies relevant to COVID-19 severity, mortality, and inflammation in the context of ACEi/ARB use. Eight studies were included with a total of 17,943 patients, 4,292 (23.9%) of which were taking an ACEi or an ARB. The study population was 47.9% female and the average age across all studies was 65. The studies chosen had a sample size of at least 100 patients. Results Mortality outcomes were assessed in six studies and showed no significant difference in mortality among the ACEi/ARB and control groups (odds ratio [OR]: 0.99, 95%CI: 0.48-2.04). Seven studies assessed the severity of COVID-19 and showed no statistically significant difference in disease severity when comparing the ACEi/ARB group to the control group (odds ratio [OR]: 1.30, 95% CI 0.87-1.94). Four studies reported the length of stay with no significant difference between the ACEi/ARB groups as compared to non-users. Four studies included inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-Dimer, which were noted to be consistently lower in the ACEi/ARB groups when compared to control groups, however, this was not statistically significant. Conclusion Our study found no significant difference in mortality, severity of illness, or length of stay between ACEi/ARB users and non-users with COVID-19 infection. These results support the continuation of ACEi and ARBs in the setting of COVID-19 as advised by the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA). The decrease in CRP and D-dimer suggests a possible protective effect related to ACEi/ARB use in COVID-19, however, more studies with larger sample sizes are needed to establish this effect.","Hassib, Mohab; Hamilton, Steven; Elkhouly, Ahmed; Li, Yiting; Kaplan, Adam C",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33728141/,646

Careful compliance with established hygiene practices by healthcare workers together with effective antiseptic options is essential for the protection of patients from infectious agents. For over 60 years, povidone iodine (PVP-I) formulations have been shown to limit the impact and spread of infectious diseases with potent antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal effects. In addition to a lack of reported resistance, the benefits of PVP-I include an excellent safety profile and a broad spectrum of effect due to its multimodal action. Studies have shown that hand washing with PVP-I-based antiseptics is effective for the decontamination of skin, while PVP-I mouthwashes and gargles significantly reduce viral load in the oral cavity and the oropharynx. The importance of PVP-I has been emphasised by its inclusion in the World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines, and high potency for virucidal activity has been observed against viruses of significant global concern, including hepatitis A and influenza, as well as the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome and Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses. Together with its diverse applications in antimicrobial control, broad accessibility across the globe, and outstanding safety and tolerability profile, PVP-I offers an affordable, potent, and widely available antiseptic option.

In this period, diseases other than coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have not disappeared; however, it is hard for doctors to diagnose diseases that can mimic the clinical, radiological, and laboratory features of COVID-19, especially rare lung diseases such as acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP). We report the clinical case of a young patient who presented to the Emergency Department with respiratory failure and clinical symptoms, radiological aspects, and blood tests compatible with COVID-19; two swabs and a serology test for SARS-CoV-2 were performed, both resulted negative, but the respiratory failure worsened. Peripheral eosinophilia guided us to consider the possibility of a rare disease such as AEP, even if radiology findings were not pathognomonic. Therefore, we decided to perform a flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at the lingula, which showed the presence of eosinophilia greater than 40%. As a consequence, we treated the patient with high-dose corticosteroids that completely resolved the respiratory symptoms. This case report highlights the difficulty of making alternative diagnoses during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for rare lung diseases such as AEP, which may have initial characteristics similar to COVID-19.","Livrieri, Francesco; Ghidoni, Giulia; Piro, Roberto; Menzella, Francesco; Cavazza, Alberto; Lazzaretti, Claudia; Massari, Marco; Montanari, Gloria; Fontana, Matteo; Facciolongo, Nicola Cosimo",Int Med Case Rep J,https://doi.org/10.2147/imcrj.s277474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173352/,646

Here, we describe an analysis procedure where genome composition and its variables are related, through the genetic code to molecular mechanisms, based on understanding of RNA replication and its feedback loop from mutation to viral proteome sequence fraternity including effective sites on the replicase-transcriptase complex. Our analysis starts with primary sequence information, identity-based phylogeny based on 22,051 SARS-CoV-2 sequences, and evaluation of sequence variation patterns as mutation spectra and its 12 permutations among organized clades. All are tailored to two key mechanisms: strand-biased and function-associated mutations. Our findings are listed as follows. (1) The most dominant mutation is C-to-U permutation, whose abundant second-codon-position counts alter amino acid composition toward higher molecular weight and lower hydrophobicity, albeit assumed most slightly deleterious. (2) The second abundance group includes three negative-strand mutations (U-to-C, A-to-G, and G-to-A) and a positive-strand mutation (G-to-U) due to DNA repair mechanisms after cellular abasic events. (3) A clade-associated biased mutation trend is found attributable to elevated level of negative-sense strand synthesis. (4) Within-clade permutation variation is very informative for associating non-synonymous mutations and viral proteome changes. These findings demand a platform where emerging mutations are mapped onto mostly subtle but fast-adjusting viral proteomes and transcriptomes, to provide biological and clinical information after logical convergence for effective pharmaceutical and diagnostic applications. Such actions are in desperate need, especially in the middle of the War against COVID-19.","Teng, Xufei; Li, Qianpeng; Li, Zhao; Zhang, Yuansheng; Niu, Guangyi; Xiao, Jingfa; Yu, Jun; Zhang, Zhang; Song, Shuhui",Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1672022921000103?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1672022921000103; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2020.10.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33581339/,646

An innovative approach to PE teacher in-service training: A self-determination theory perspective,2020-08-20,"Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms, whose transmission can lead to global pandemics like COVID-19. Contact with contaminated surfaces or objects is one of the major channels of spreading infectious diseases among the community. Therefore, the typical contaminable surfaces, such as walls and handrails, should often be cleaned using disinfectants. Nevertheless, safety and efficiency are the major concerns of the utilization of human labor in this process. Thereby, attention has drifted toward developing robotic solutions for the disinfection of contaminable surfaces. A robot intended for disinfecting walls should be capable of following the wall concerned, while maintaining a given distance, to be effective. The ability to operate in an unknown environment while coping with uncertainties is crucial for a wall disinfection robot intended for deployment in public spaces. Therefore, this paper contributes to the state-of-the-art by proposing a novel method of establishing the wall-following behavior for a wall disinfection robot using fuzzy logic. A non-singleton Type 1 Fuzzy Logic System (T1-FLS) and a non-singleton Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Logic System (IT2-FLS) are developed in this regard. The wall-following behavior of the two fuzzy systems was evaluated through simulations by considering heterogeneous wall arrangements. The simulation results validate the real-world applicability of the proposed FLSs for establishing the wall-following behavior for a wall disinfection robot. Furthermore, the statistical outcomes show that the IT2-FLS has significantly superior performance than the T1-FLS in this application.","Muthugala, M. A. Viraj J.; Samarakoon, S. M.

This disease has a multifactorial origin and it is associated with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, metabolic syndrome, cancer, and dyslipidemia. With regard to dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia is a well-known activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome, triggering adipokines and cytokines secretion which in addition induce a systemic inflammatory state that provides an adequate scenario for infections, particularly those mediated by viruses such as HIV, H1N1 influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and it is responsible for the pandemic that we are currently living. COVID-19 causes an aggressive immune response known as cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm that causes multiorgan failure and in most cases leads to death. In the present work, we aimed to review the molecular mechanisms by which obesity-associated systemic inflammation could cause a more severe clinical presentation of COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 infection could potentiate or accelerate the pre-existing systemic inflammatory state of individuals with obesity, via the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from cells trough Gasdermin-pores commonly found in cell death by pyroptosis.","López-Reyes, Alberto; Martinez-Armenta, Carlos; Espinosa-Velázquez, Rocio; Vázquez-Cárdenas, Paola; Cruz-Ramos, Marlid; Palacios-Gonzalez, Berenice; Gomez-Quiroz, Luis Enrique; Martínez-Nava, Gabriela Angélica",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.570251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33193349/,646
617282,"COVID-19 spreading in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: do the policies of social isolation really work?",2020-05-23,"Chlamydiae may exist at the site of infection in an alternative replicative form, called the aberrant body (AB). ABs are produced during a viable but non-infectious developmental state termed “persistence” or “chlamydial stress.” As persistent/stressed chlamydiae: (i) may contribute to chronic inflammation observed in diseases like trachoma; and (ii) are more resistant to current anti-chlamydial drugs of choice, it is critical to better understand this developmental stage. We previously demonstrated that porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) co-infection induced Chlamydia pecorum persistence/stress in culture. One critical characteristic of persistence/stress is that the chlamydiae remain viable and can reenter the normal developmental cycle when the stressor is removed. Thus, we hypothesized that PEDV-induced persistence would be reversible if viral replication was inhibited. Therefore, we performed time course experiments in which Vero cells were C. pecorum/PEDV infected in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), which inhibits viral but not chlamydial protein synthesis. CHX-exposure inhibited PEDV replication, but did not inhibit induction of C. pecorum persistence at 24 h post-PEDV infection, as indicated by AB formation and reduced production of infectious EBs. Interestingly, production of infectious EBs resumed when CHX-exposed, co-infected cells were incubated 48–72 h post-PEDV co-infection. These data demonstrate that PEDV co-infection-induced chlamydial persistence/stress is reversible and suggest that this induction (i) does not require viral replication in host cells; and (ii) does not require de novo host or viral protein synthesis. These data also suggest that viral binding and/or entry may be required for this effect. Because the PEDV host cell receptor (CD13 or aminopeptidase N) stimulates cellular signaling pathways in the absence of PEDV infection, we suspect that PEDV co-infection might alter CD13 function and induce the chlamydiae to enter the persistent state.","Schoborg, Robert V.; Borel, Nicole",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2014.00020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660163/,646

Methods: We performed a multicentre retrospective cohort study in 18 tertiary hospitals in Spain, from March to April 2020. Consecutive patients admitted with severe COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab were compared to patients not treated with tocilizumab, adjusting by Inverse Probability of the Treatment Weights (IPTW). Tocilizumab effect in patients receiving steroids during the 48h following inclusion was analyzed. Results: During the study period, 506 patients with severe COVID-19 fulfilled inclusion criteria. Among them, 268 were treated with tocilizumab and 238 patients were not. Median time to tocilizumab treatment from onset of symptoms was 11 days (IQR 8-14). Global mortality was 23.7%. Mortality was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab than in controls (16.8% versus 31.5%, HR 0.514 [95CI 0.355-0.744], p<0.001; weighted HR 0.741 [95CI 0.619-0.887], p=0.001). Tocilizumab treatment reduced mortality by 14.7% relative to no tocilizumab treatment (RRR 46.7%). We calculated a number necessary to treat of 7. Among patients treated with steroids, mortality was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab than in those treated with steroids alone (10.9% versus 40.2%, HR 0.511 [95CI 0.352-0.741], p=0.036; weighted HR 0.6 [95CI 0.449-0.804], p<0.001) (Interaction p=0.094). Conclusions: These results show that survival of patients with severe COVID-19 is higher in patients treated with tocilizumab than in those not treated, and that tocilizumab effect adds to that of steroids administered to non-intubated cases with COVID-19 during the first 48 hours of presenting with respiratory failure despite of oxygen therapy.

628357,"COVID-19 testing before endoscopy safe, effective in the US",2020-05-16,"COVID-19 has posed an unprecedented global public health threat and caused a significant number of severe cases that necessitated long hospitalization and overwhelmed health services in the most affected countries. In response, governments initiated a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that led to severe economic and social impacts. The effect of these intervention measures on the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic are not well investigated within developing country settings. This study simulated the trajectories of the COVID-19 pandemic curve in Jordan between February and May and assessed the effect of Jordan’s strict NPI measures on the spread of COVID-19. A modified susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered (SEIR) epidemic model was utilized. The compartments in the proposed model categorized the Jordanian population into six deterministic compartments: suspected, exposed, infectious pre-symptomatic, infectious with mild symptoms, infectious with moderate to severe symptoms, and recovered. The GLEAMviz client simulator was used to run the simulation model. Epidemic curves were plotted for estimated COVID-19 cases in the simulation model, and compared against the reported cases. The simulation model estimated the highest number of total daily new COVID-19 cases, in the pre-symptomatic compartmental state, to be 65 cases, with an epidemic curve growing to its peak in 49 days and terminating in a duration of 83 days, and a total simulated cumulative case count of 1048 cases.

The placing of entire cities in ‘lockdown’ directly affects urban economies on a multi-lateral level, including from social and economic standpoints. This is being emphasised as the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading towards a global health emergency, and as global collaboration is sought in numerous quarters. However, while effective protocols in regard to the sharing of health data is emphasised, urban data, on the other hand, specifically relating to urban health and safe city concepts, is still viewed from a nationalist perspective as solely benefiting a nation’s economy and its economic and political influence. This perspective paper, written one month after detection and during the outbreak, surveys the virus outbreak from an urban standpoint and advances how smart city networks should work towards enhancing standardization protocols for increased data sharing in the event of outbreaks or disasters, leading to better global understanding and management of the same.","Allam, Zaheer; Jones, David S.",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8010046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32120822/,646

Managing a healthy lifestyle has been shown to reduce blood pressure and improve health outcomes. We aim to investigate the effectiveness of a lifestyle modification intervention program for lowering blood pressure in a rural area of Bangladesh. METHODS: A single-center cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). The study will be conducted for 6 months, a total of 300 participants of age 30 to 75 years with 150 adults in each of the intervention and the control arms. The intervention arm will involve the delivery of a blended learning education program on lifestyle changes for the management of high blood pressure. The education program comprises evidence-based information with pictures, fact sheets, and published literature about the effects of high blood pressure on CVD development, increased physical activity, and the role of a healthy diet in blood pressure management. The control group involves providing information booklets and general advice at the baseline data collection point. The primary outcome will be the absolute difference in clinic SBP and DBP. Secondary outcomes include the difference in the percentage of people adopting regular exercise habits, cessation of smoking and reducing sodium chloride intake, health literacy of all participants, and the perceived barriers and enablers to adopt behavior changes by collecting qualitative data. Analyses will include analysis of covariance to report the mean difference in blood pressure between the control and the intervention group and the difference in change in blood pressure due to the intervention. DISCUSSION: The study will assess the effects of physical activity and lifestyle modification in controlling high blood pressure. This study will develop new evidence as to whether a simple lifestyle program implemented in a rural region of a low- and middle-income country will improve blood pressure parameters for people with different chronic diseases by engaging community people.

We assessed the association between location-specific community mobility and the reproduction number (R) of SARS-CoV-2 across UK local authorities. METHODS: In this modelling study, we linked data on community mobility from Google with data on R from 330 UK local authorities, for the period June 1, 2020, to Feb 13, 2021. Six mobility metrics are available in the Google community mobility dataset: visits to retail and recreation places, visits to grocery and pharmacy stores, visits to transit stations, visits to parks, visits to workplaces, and length of stay in residential places. For each local authority, we modelled the weekly change in R (the R ratio) per a rescaled weekly percentage change in each location-specific mobility metric relative to a pre-pandemic baseline period (Jan 3–Feb 6, 2020), with results synthesised across local authorities using a random-effects meta-analysis. FINDINGS: On a weekly basis, increased visits to retail and recreation places were associated with a substantial increase in R (R ratio 1·053 [99·2% CI 1·041–1·065] per 15% weekly increase compared with baseline visits) as were increased visits to workplaces (R ratio 1·060 [1·046–1·074] per 10% increase compared with baseline visits). By comparison, increased visits to grocery and pharmacy stores were associated with a small but still statistically significant increase in R (R ratio 1·011 [1·005–1·017] per 5% weekly increase compared with baseline visits). Increased visits to parks were associated with a decreased R (R ratio 0·972 [0·965–0·980]), as were longer stays at residential areas (R ratio 0·952 [0·928–0·976]). Increased visits to transit stations were not associated with R nationally, but were associated with a substantial increase in R in cities. An increasing trend was observed for the first 6 weeks of 2021 in the effect of visits to retail and recreation places and workplaces on R. INTERPRETATION: Increased visits to retail and recreation places, workplaces, and transit stations in cities are important drivers of increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission; the increasing trend in the effects of these drivers in the first 6 weeks of 2021 was possibly associated with the emerging alpha (B.1.1.7) variant. These findings provide important evidence for the management of current and future mobility restrictions.

METHODS: The levels of abdominal (visceral and subcutaneous) fat, pericardial fat, and psoas major muscle were measured in subjects who had physical examinations at the Health and Medical Department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from July 2019 to June 2020. The relationship between fat in different areas (ie, different types of fat) and the relationship between different types of fat and the psoas major muscle were investigated in the context of different genders and ages. RESULTS: The distribution of fat and muscle differed between males and females of the middle-aged and elderly study sample. Volumes of pericardial fat, total abdominal fat, and visceral fat were significantly lower in females than in males, and the area of the psoas major muscle was also significantly lower in females than in males. Levels of subcutaneous fat and total abdominal fat showed no significant correlation with age. The level of muscle showed a significant negative correlation with age. CONCLUSION: 1) Within the middle-aged and elderly sample, male subjects had higher levels than females of all types of fat except for abdominal subcutaneous fat, and had higher levels of psoas muscle than females. 2) Pericardial fat increased with age, whereas levels of abdominal fat did not change significantly with age. 3) The area of psoas major muscle appears to be positively correlated with volumes of all types of fat: subjects with more fat tended to have higher levels of psoas major muscle.","Ni, Xuefeng; Jiao, Li; Zhang, Ye; Xu, Jin; Zhang, Yunqing; Zhang, Xiaona; Du, Yao; Sun, Zhaoyong; Wang, Shitian",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34045873/; https://doi.org/10.2147/dmso.s299171,646

The coagulopathy of COVID-19 is postulated to result from interactions of the inflammatory and immune systems with the coagulation system, manifesting as a cytokine storm associated with hyperinflammation and coagulation and platelet activation. Unique characteristics of VTE in hospitalized and critically ill patients with COVID-19 include the high incidence of VTE (and especially pulmonary embolism) when compared with historical controls; the finding of in situ pulmonary embolism associated with microthrombi, which suggests a thrombotic microangiopathic process in addition to classic macrovessel disease; and, most important from a clinical perspective, the unusually high rate of VTE that has been reported despite standard thromboprophylaxis. This raises the possibility that intermediate or weight-based heparin dosing may be more effective than fixed dosing for thromboprophylaxis in high-risk subsets of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. There have been several guidance statements focusing on the management of VTE in hospitalized and critically ill patients with COVID-19, including the most recent statement by the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, which includes comprehensive guidance on the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of VTE in this patient population.

Action by cities is therefore crucial for climate change mitigation as well as for safeguarding the health and wellbeing of their populations under climate change. Many city governments have made ambitious commitments to climate change mitigation and adaptation and implemented a range of actions to address them. However, a systematic record and synthesis of the findings of evaluations of the effect of such actions on human health and wellbeing is currently lacking. This, in turn, impedes the development of robust knowledge on what constitutes high-impact climate actions of benefit to human health and wellbeing, which can inform future action plans, their implementation and scale-up. The development of a systematic record of studies reporting climate and health actions in cities is made challenging by the broad landscape of relevant literature scattered across many disciplines and sectors, which is challenging to effectively consolidate using traditional literature review methods. This protocol reports an innovative approach for the systematic development of a database of studies of climate change mitigation and adaptation actions implemented in cities, and their benefits (or disbenefits) for human health and wellbeing, derived from peer-reviewed academic literature. Our approach draws on extensive tailored search strategies and machine learning methods for article classification and tagging to generate a database for subsequent systematic reviews addressing questions of importance to urban decision-makers on climate actions in cities for human health and wellbeing.","Belesova, Kristine; Callaghan, Max; Minx, Jan C; Creutzig, Felix; Turcu, Catalina; Hutchinson, Emma; Milner, James; Crane, Melanie; Haines, Andy; Davies, Michael; Wilkinson, Paul",Wellcome Open Res,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16570.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33860107/,646

Empirical Evidence From Chinese International Students,2021-05-28,"BACKGROUND: In 2018, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) mandated implementation of a national suicide risk identification strategy (Risk ID). The goal of Risk ID is to improve the detection and management of suicide risk by standardizing suicide risk screening and evaluation enterprise-wide. In order to ensure continuous quality improvement (QI), ongoing evaluation and targeted interventions to improve implementation of Risk ID are needed. Moreover, given that facilities will vary with respect to implementation needs and barriers, the dose and type of intervention needed may vary across facilities. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of an adaptive implementation strategy to improve the uptake of suicide risk screening and evaluation in VHA ambulatory care settings. In addition, this study will examine specific factors that may impact the uptake of suicide risk screening and evaluation and the adoption of different implementation strategies. This protocol describes the stepped implementation approach and proposed evaluation plan. METHODS: Using a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design, two evidence-based implementation strategies will be evaluated: (1) audit and feedback (A&F); (2) A&F plus external facilitation (A&F + EF). Implementation outcomes of interest include uptake of secondary suicide risk screening and uptake of comprehensive suicide risk evaluation (stages 2 and 3 of Risk ID). Secondary outcomes include rates of other clinical outcomes (i.e., safety planning) and organizational factors that may impact Risk ID implementation (i.e., leadership climate and leadership support). DISCUSSION: This national QI study will use a SMART design to evaluate whether an adaptive implementation strategy is effective in improving uptake of a mandated VHA-wide suicide risk screening and evaluation initiative. If this study finds that the proposed stepped implementation strategy is effective at increasing uptake and maintaining performance improvements, this approach may be used as an overarching QI strategy for other national suicide prevention programs.

Since the outbreak, researchers and policymakers have scrambled to develop ways to identify how COVID-19 will affect specific sub-populations so that good public health decisions can be made. To this end, we adapt the work of Evensen 2020 et al. which introduces a SEIR model that incorporates an age-stratified contact matrix, a time dependent effective reproduction number R, and uses ensemble data assimilation to estimate model parameters. The adaptation is an extension of Evensen's modeling framework, in which we model sub-populations with varying risks of contracting SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) in a particular state, each with a characteristic age-stratified contact matrix. In this work, we will focus on 9 U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia. We estimate the effective reproductive number as a function of time for our different sub-populations and then divide them into two groups: frontline communities (FLCs) and the complement (NFLCs). Our model will account for mixing both within populations (intra-population mixing) and between populations (inter-population mixing). Our data is conditioned on the daily numbers of accumulated deaths for each sub-population. We aim to test and demonstrate methodologies that can be used to assess critical metrics of the pandemic's evolution which are difficult to directly measure. The output may ultimately be of use to measure the success or failures of the pandemic response and provide experts and policymakers a tool to create better plans for a future outbreak or pandemic.

Oxysterols, defined as oxidized derivatives of cholesterol, include endogenous (naturally occurring) cholesterol metabolites as well as semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives. We have previously studied the use of semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives as drug candidates for inhibition of cancer, fibrosis, and bone regeneration. In this study, we have screened a panel of naturally occurring and semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, using a cell culture infection assay. We show that the natural oxysterols, 7-ketocholesterol, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol, substantially inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cultured cells. Among semi-synthetic oxysterols, Oxy186 displayed antiviral activity comparable to natural oxysterols. In addition, related oxysterol analogues Oxy210 and Oxy232 displayed more robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, reducing viral replication more than 90% at 10 μM and 99% at 15 μM, respectively. When orally administered in mice, peak plasma concentrations of Oxy210 fall into a therapeutically relevant range (19 μM), based on the dose-dependent curve for antiviral activity in our cell culture infection assay. Mechanistic studies suggest that Oxy210 reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2 with disrupting the formation of double membrane vesicles (DMVs), intracellular membrane compartments associated with viral replication. Oxy210 also inhibited the replication of hepatitis C virus, another RNA virus whose replication is associated with DMVs, but not the replication of the DMV-independent hepatitis D virus. Our study warrants further evaluation of Oxy210 and Oxy232 as a safe and reliable oral medication, which could help protect vulnerable populations with increased risk developing COVID-19.","Ohashi, Hirofumi; Wang, Feng; Stappenbeck, Frank; Tsuchimoto, Kana; Kobayashi, Chisa; Saso, Wakana; Kataoka, Michiyo; Kuramochi, Kouji; Muramatsu, Masamichi; Suzuki, Tadaki; Sureau, Camille; Takeda, Makoto; Wakita, Takaji; Parhami, Farhad; Watashi, Koichi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.31.429001,646

Specifically, vulnerable people should not face discrimination because of their vulnerability in the allocation of care or life-sustaining treatments. Adoption of biopsychosocial model helps to identify key elements where to act to diminish effects of the pandemics. The pandemic showed us that barriers in health care organization affect mostly those that are vulnerable and can suffer discrimination not because of severity of diseases but just because of their vulnerability, be this age or disability and this can be avoided by biopsychosocial planning in health and social policies. It is possible to avoid the banality of evil, intended as lack of thinking on what we do when we do, by using the emergence of the emergency of COVID-19 as a Trojan horse to achieve some of the sustainable development goals such as universal health coverage and equity in access, thus acting on environmental factors is the key for global health improvement.","Leonardi, Matilde; Lee, Haejung; van der Veen, Sabina; Maribo, Thomas; Cuenot, Marie; Simon, Liane; Paltamaa, Jaana; Maart, Soraya; Tucker, Carole; Besstrashnova, Yanina; Shosmin, Alexander; Cid, Daniel; Almborg, Ann-Helene; Anttila, Heidi; Yamada, Shin; Frattura, Lucilla; Zavaroni, Carlo; Zhuoying, Qiu; Martinuzzi, Andrea; Martinuzzi, Michela; Magnani, Francesca Giulia; Snyman, Stefanus; El Oumri, Ahmed Amine; Sylvain, Ndegeya; Layton, Natasha; Sykes, Catherine; Saleeby, Patricia Welch; Winkler, Andrea Sylvia; de Camargo, Olaf Kraus",SN Compr Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42399-020-00486-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32905109/,646

662700,Fostering teaching-learning through workplace based assessment in postgraduate chemical pathology residency program using virtual learning environment,2020-10-23,"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Tularemia is a zoonotic infection caused by Francisella tularensis, an anaerobic and fastidious gram-negative bacterium. It is transmitted from direct inhalational exposure and bites from infected ticks, rabbits, rodents, birds, or domestic animals. About 200 cases of human tularemia are reported each year in the United States. We report an unusual case of tularemia without any known exposure with a recent Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection with an overlap of symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: A healthy 22 years old male with an uncomplicated COVID-19 infection a month ago presented with fever, nausea, vomiting for a week and a resolving inguinal rash with no recent travel, sick contacts, occupational or animal exposures. On admission, he was febrile up to 103.4, tachycardiac and tachypneic with coarse breath sounds in bilateral lungs, right cervical adenopathy without any rash or erythema on the skin. His initial labs were WBC 16.6 k/mcl, platelets 154 k/mcl, elevated inflammatory markers (ESR 64mm/hr, CRP 164mg/ml), mild transaminitis (AST/ALT 43/89 uL), negative COVID-19 PCR, initial troponin of 1.6 which peaked to 3.6 and a procalcitonin 12.6. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, a chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed bilateral basilar heterogenous opacities, echocardiography showed regional wall motion abnormalities with preserved ejection fraction and right internal jugular vein thrombosis on the upper extremity doppler ultrasound. On hospital day 2, he developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure and septic shock requiring mechanical ventilation. Initial differential diagnosis was concerning for acute viral illness, viral myocarditis, murine typhus, bacterial pneumonia, and COVID-19 inflammatory syndrome. A complete viral and autoimmune workup was negative except for a positive Francisella tularemia antibody. He completed 10 days of oral doxycycline and was discharged home on room air on three months of rivaroxaban. DISCUSSION: Pneumonic tularemia presents with initial non-specific symptoms followed by fever, chest pain, productive cough with nodular infiltrates with pleural effusion on imaging, it can be challenging to diagnose with overlapping symptoms with COVID-19. In our case, the initial history and imaging findings could have been consistent with viral myocarditis and post COVID-19 hypoxia.Yet, the ability to wean off oxygen and the rapid improvement in symptoms with initial treatment without steroids was more consistent with some other viral or bacterial etiology of disease. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with superimposed bacterial and fungal infections. Limited data is available on the covid-19 inflammatory syndrome with superimposed zoonotic infections. However, clinicians must be vigilant of other febrile illnesses and alternative diagnoses whose symptoms overlap with COVID-19. REFERENCE #1: Patel HM.

The main clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19, coronavirus disease-2019) is pneumonia, but several cardiovascular complications may also occur (e.g., acute coronary syndromes, pulmonary embolism, stroke, arrhythmias, heart failure and cardiogenic shock). Direct or indirect mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2 could be implicated in the pathogenesis of these events. CASE PRESENTATION: We report herein the third case of COVID-19 autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) reported so far, which occurredwithout any other possible explanations in a Caucasian patient. The patient also suffered from ST-elevation myocardial injury. CONCLUSIONS: Both complications occurred quite late after COVID-19 diagnosis and were probably precipitated by systemic inflammation, as indicated by a significant delayed increase in inflammatory markers, including interleukin-6 (IL-6).","Pelle, Maria Chiara; Tassone, Bruno; Ricchio, Marco; Mazzitelli, Maria; Davoli, Chiara; Procopio, Giada; Cancelliere, Anna; La Gamba, Valentina; Lio, Elena; Matera, Giovanni; Quirino, Angela; Barreca, Giorgio Settimo; Trecarichi, Enrico Maria; Torti, Carlo",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33339534/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-020-02595-3,646

Several studies show that depression is highly prevalent among quarantined individuals. COVID-19 is a pandemic with a rapidly increasing incidence of infections and deaths. People are depressed and psychologically overwhelmed by the illness and possible loss of their friends and loved ones. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and associated factors of depression symptoms among quarantined individuals in Tigrai treatment center, Tigrai, Ethiopia, 2020. METHODS: A multicenter Institution-based cross-sectional study was employed among individuals in the Tigrai quarantine centers. A simple random sampling technique was used between April and October 2020 until an adequate sample size was reached. Depression was assessed by using the depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS). Epi data manager version 4.4 was used to enter data and data was analyzed using SPSS version 20. Logistic regression was carried out and an odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was computed to identify factors associated with depression. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant and the strength of the association was presented by an odds ratio of 95% CI. RESULTS: The finding of the present study on the prevalence of depression among quarantined individuals was 18.1 with 95% CI (14.8–22.9). Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed and factors such as being female, duration of quarantine, unemployment, and having perceived stigma were significantly associated with depression. RECOMMENDATION AND CONCLUSION: The prevalence of depression symptoms among quarantined individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic was 18.1%. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, being female, duration of quarantine, unemployment, and having perceived stigma were significantly associated with depression. So, clinicians, mental health professionals, and policymakers should work together to address the problem.","Hagezom, Haftamu Mamo; Gebrehiwet, Ataklti Berhe; Haftom Goytom, Mekonnen; Alemseged, Embaye Amare",Infect Drug Resist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34113138/; https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s289659,646

Although the disease can result in diverse, multiorgan pathology, there have been very few studies addressing the postmortem pathological findings of the cases. Active autopsy amid this pandemic could be an essential tool for diagnosis, surveillance, and research. Objective: To provide a total picture of the SARS-CoV-2 histopathological features of different body organs in postmortem autopsies through a systematic search of the published literature. Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google scholar, Medrxiv & Biorxiv) was carried out from December 2019 to August, 15th 2020, for journal articles of different study designs reporting postmortem pathological findings in COVID-19 cases. PRISMA guidelines were used for reporting the review. Results: A total of 50 articles reporting 430 cases were included in our analysis. Postmortem pathological findings were reported for different body organs, pulmonary system (42 articles), cardiovascular system ( 23 articles), hepatobiliary system (22 articles), kidney (16 articles), spleen, and lymph nodes (12 articles), and central nervous system (7 articles). In lung samples, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was the most commonly reported findings in 239 cases (84.4%). Myocardial hypertrophy (87 cases by 51.2%), arteriosclerosis (121 cases by 62%), and steatosis ( 118 cases by 59.3%) were the most commonly reported pathological findings in the heart, kidney, and hepatobiliary system respectively.

During treatment, 13 patients deteriorated and required further treatment for supporting organ function. The remaining 20 patients alleviated and were transferred to the general wards. The multivariate COX regression analyses showed that hypoproteinemia was an independent risk factor associated with deterioration of severe patients (HR, 0.763; 95% CI, 0.596 to 0.978; p = 0.033). The restricted cubic spline indicated that when HR = 1, the corresponding value of albumin is 29.6 g/L. We used the cutoff of 29.6 g/L to divide these patients. Kaplan–Meier curves showed that the survival rate of the high-albumin group was higher than that of the low-albumin group. Therefore, hypoalbuminemia may be an independent risk factor to evaluate poor prognosis of severely patients with COVID-19, especially when albumin levels were below 29.6 g/L.","Lin, Liu; Hu, Kaiyuan; Cai, Shuijiang; Deng, Xilong; Shao, Xinning; Liang, Ying; Wang, Jigang; Zhong, Tianyu; Hu, Zhongwei; Lei, Ming",J Clin Biochem Nutr,https://doi.org/10.3164/jcbn.20-75; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33041508/,646
671426,Anatomy of the Stimulus Package in Bangladesh,2020-09-07,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are strong immunomodulatory cells investigated in numerous clinical studies on fatal pathologies, such as graft versus host disease and autoimmune diseases; e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Macrophages are one of the critical cells linking the innate and adaptive immune system, and it has been shown that MSCs can differentiate between pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype of macrophages. However, it has not yet been fully clarified whether these differentiated macrophages are functional. In this study, we compared the immunomodulatory effects on the CD4 T cells of M1, M2a and M2c macrophages with the macrophages that directly and indirectly cultured with MSCs. We analyzed the changes in CD14, CD64, CD80, CD163 and CD200R expression to evaluate macrophage phenotypes, and the changes in CD4, IFN-g, IL-4, IL-17a and FoxP3 expression to evaluate T helper subsets using the FACS method. The changes in IL-1b, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17a and IFN-g in the media supernatants were analyzed using the Luminex method. We also performed WST-1 and Caspase-3 ELISA analyses to observe the proliferation and apoptosis status of the T cells. MSCs were found to differentiate macrophages into a distinctive phenotype, which was close to the M2c phenotype, but was not considered as an M2c cell due to the low expression of CD163, a characteristic marker for M2c. While MEM-D, MEM-ID and MSCs showed similar inhibitory effects on the Th2 and Th17 cells, the most significant increase in Treg cell frequencies was seen in MEM-D cells. Macrophages can alter their phenotypes and functions according to the stimuli from the environment. The fact that macrophages educated with MSCs suppressed the production of all the cytokines we evaluated even after the removal of MSCs suggests that these cells may be differentiated by MSCs into a suppressive macrophage subgroup. However, the Treg cell activation caused by direct interactions between MSCs and macrophage cells may be the most prominent observation of this study compared to previous work. As a result, according to our data, the interactions between MSCs and macrophages may lead to differentiation of macrophage cells into an immunosuppressive phenotype, and these macrophages may suppress the T lymphocyte subgroups at least as effectively as MSCs. However, our data obtained from in vitro experiments should be supported by future in vivo studies.","Özdemir, Rabia Bilge Özgül; Özdemir, Alper Tunga; Sarıboyacı, Ayla Eker; Uysal, Onur; Tuğlu, Mehmet İbrahim; Kırmaz, Cengiz",Immunobiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31072631/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imbio.2019.04.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0171298518302389; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0171298518302389,646

METHODS: All patients over 28 days old testing positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 between March 1 and September 30, 2020, were retrospectively identified and characterized through electronic analysis at Stanford. A sub‐cohort was followed prospectively to evaluate long‐term COVID‐19 symptoms. RESULTS: 168,190 patients underwent SARS‐CoV‐2 testing, and 6,976 (4.15%) tested positive. In a multivariate analysis, asthma was not an independent risk factor for hospitalization (OR 1.12 [95% CI 0.86, 1.45], p = .40). Among SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive asthmatics, allergic asthma lowered the risk of hospitalization and had a protective effect compared with non‐allergic asthma (OR 0.52 [0.28, 0.91], p = .026); there was no association between baseline medication use as characterized by GINA and hospitalization risk. Patients with severe COVID‐19 disease had lower eosinophil levels during hospitalization compared with patients with mild or asymptomatic disease, independent of asthma status (p = .0014). In a patient sub‐cohort followed longitudinally, asthmatics and non‐asthmatics had similar time to resolution of COVID‐19 symptoms, particularly lower respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Asthma is not a risk factor for more severe COVID‐19 disease. Allergic asthmatics were half as likely to be hospitalized with COVID‐19 compared with non‐allergic asthmatics. Lower levels of eosinophil counts (allergic biomarkers) were associated with a more severe COVID‐19 disease trajectory.

The article’s research question is: to what extent was Australia’s federal structure responsible for the relative successes and failures of the national pandemic response? The method chosen to answer this question is largely theoretical, supplemented by aspects of institutional and policy analysis. That is to say, the inquiry identifies what were widely considered to be important policies, and considers the extent to which the formulation and implementation of those policies was furthered or hindered by the institutions and relations forming Australia’s federal structure. Five policy areas are considered, namely: the National Cabinet; social distancing and related policies; international travel and quarantine; interstate travel; and cities and local government. The conclusions reached are that a number of policy responses achieved federalism’s objectives of enhancing local decision-making power, increasing state and federal cooperation, and cabining policy failure. While Australia’s was not an unmitigated success story, on the whole the pandemic galvanized and reinvigorated Australia’s federal structure and institutions.","Murphy, Julian R; Arban, Erika",Publius,https://doi.org/10.1093/publius/pjab026,646

A case study of digital-enabled redesign of entrepreneurship education in the COVID-19 emergency,2021-01-22,"The role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission poses challenges for control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Study of asymptomatic transmission and implications for surveillance and disease burden are ongoing, but there has been little study of the implications of asymptomatic transmission on dynamics of disease. We use a mathematical framework to evaluate expected effects of asymptomatic transmission on the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population) and the fraction of new secondary cases attributable to asymptomatic individuals. If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, [Formula: see text] will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, [Formula: see text] will be under-estimated. Estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase also depend on asymptomatic generation intervals. Our analysis shows that understanding the temporal course of asymptomatic transmission can be important for assessing the importance of this route of transmission, and for disease dynamics. This provides an additional motivation for investigating both the importance and relative duration of asymptomatic transmission.","Park, Sang Woo; Cornforth, Daniel M.; Dushoff, Jonathan; Weitz, Joshua S.",Epidemics,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436520300190?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32446187/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755436520300190; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2020.100392,646
680839,Improving the portability of predicting students’ performance models by using ontologies,2021-03-24,"With significant declines in malaria, infections are increasingly clustered in households, or groups of households where malaria transmission is higher than in surrounding household/villages. To decrease transmission in such cases, reactive interventions target household members of clinical malaria cases, with the intervention unit (e.g., the “household/s”) derived from an epidemiological and operational perspective. A lack of unanimity regarding the spatial range of the intervention unit calls for greater importance to be placed on social context in conceptualizing the appropriate unit. A novel malaria elimination strategy based on reactive treatment was recently evaluated by a cluster randomized trial in a low transmission setting in The Gambia. Transdisciplinary research was used to assess and improve the effectiveness of the intervention which consisted, among others, of reflecting on whether the household was the most adequate unit of analysis. The intervention was piloted on the smallest treatment unit possible and was further adapted following a better understanding of the social and epidemiological context. Intervention units defined according to (i) shared sleeping spaces and (ii) household membership, showed substantial limitations as it was not possible to define them clearly and they were extremely variable within the study setting. Incorporating local definitions and community preference in the trial design led to the appropriate intervention unit—the compound—defined as an enclosed space containing one or several households belonging to the same extended patrilineal family. Our study demonstrates the appropriateness of using transdisciplinary research for investigating alternative intervention units that are better tailored to reactive treatment approaches.","Jaiteh, Fatou; Ribera, Joan Muela; Masunaga, Yoriko; Okebe, Joseph; D'Alessandro, Umberto; Balen, Julie; Achan, Jane; Gerrets, Rene; Peeters Grietens, Koen",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33718317/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.601152,646
681419,Digital teaching and learning of surgical skills (not only) during the pandemic: a report on a blended learning project,2020-12-03,"Over the past few years, cellular immunotherapy has emerged as a novel treatment option for certain forms of hematologic malignancies with multiple CAR-T therapies now routinely administered in the clinic. The limitations of generating an autologous cell product and the challenges of toxicity with CAR-T cells underscore the need to develop novel cell therapy products that are universal, safe, and potent. Natural killer (NK) cells are part of the innate immune system with unique advantages, including the potential for off-the-shelf therapy. A recent first-in-human trial of CD19-CAR-NK infusion in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoid malignancies proved safe with promising clinical activity. Building on these encouraging clinical responses, research is now actively exploring ways to further enhance CAR-NK cell potency by prolonging in vivo persistence and overcoming mechanisms of functional exhaustion. Besides these strategies to modulate CAR-NK cell intrinsic properties, there are increasing efforts to translate the successes seen in hematologic malignancies to the solid tumor space. This review will provide an overview on current trends and evolving concepts to genetically engineer the next generation of CAR-NK therapies. Emphasis will be placed on innovative multiplexed engineering approaches including CRISPR/Cas9 to overcome CAR-NK functional exhaustion and reprogram immune cell metabolism for enhanced potency.","Biederstädt, Alexander; Rezvani, Katayoun",Int J Hematol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12185-021-03209-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34453686/,646

This study assessed the effect of early intubation and mechanical ventilation on all-cause, inhospital mortality for coronavirus disease 2019 patients. DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Eleven municipal hospitals in New York City from March 1, 2020, to December 1, 2020. PATIENTS: Adult patients who tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 in the emergency department were subsequently admitted. Patients with do-not-intubate orders at admission were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Intubation within 48 hours of triage and intubation at any point during hospital stay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data from 7,597 coronavirus disease 2019 patients were included; of these, 1,628 (21%) were intubated overall and 807 (11%) were intubated within 48 hours of triage. After controlling for available confounders, intubation rates for coronavirus disease 2019 patients varied significantly across hospitals and decreased steadily as the pandemic progressed. After nearest neighbor propensity score matching, intubation within 48 hours of triage was associated with higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.30 [1.15–1.48]; p < 0.0001), as was intubation at any time point (hazard ratio, 1.62 [1.45–1.80]; p < 0.0001). Among intubated patients, intubation within 48 hours of triage was not significantly associated with differences in mortality (hazard ratio, 1.09 [0.94–1.26]; p = 0.26). These results remained robust to multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Intubation within 48 hours of triage, as well as at any time point in the hospital course, was associated with increased mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 patients in this observational study.","Parish, Austin J.; West, Jason R.; Caputo, Nicholas D.; Janus, Trevor M.; Yuan, Denley; Zhang, John; Singer, Daniel J.",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151281/; https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000452,646

In the present study, we carried out clinical, pathological, and molecular investigations of MP-induced MRM in a rat colony. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two female Wistar rats were observed to be diseased in animal facility of NISER, Bhubaneswar, and were kept in isolation for further investigation. Both the animals were found to be positive for MP after serological and molecular tests. Thereafter, whole rat colony comprising of 36 animals was segregated based on clinical symptoms and further sampled for histopathological, serological, and molecular investigations. Tracheal washing and infected lung tissue were collected during necropsy examination for DNA extraction. Molecular diagnosis was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using species-specific primers. RESULT:: Classical symptoms of MP-associated respiratory tract infection were observed in only 2 of 36 infected animals, and most of the animals were found asymptomatic to the disease; however, all the animals were found to be carrier after necropsy and PCR assay. Gross and histopathological finding suggested severe congestion of the lungs along with suppurative and necrotizing pneumonia. The disease is confirmed by molecular diagnosis using species-specific primers in PCR assay. CONCLUSION: MRM may go undiagnosed due to asymptomatic nature. Detailed study of clinical symptoms, pathology, serology, and PCR-based molecular approach may aid in health monitoring and detection of MRM in a rodent colony reared for experimental purpose.","Chawla, Saurabh; Jena, Sarita; Venkatsan, Balaji; Mahara, Kuna; Sahu, Nilanjan",Vet World,https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2017.1378-1382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29263602/,646

The method in [8] is applied here to analyze the COVID-19 waves in India and the UK. For this, a birth-death model is fitted to the active and total cases data for 30 days periods called windows starting from 16th March 2020 up to 10th May 2021. Peculiarities of the parameters suggested a classification of the above windows into three categories: (i) whose fitted parameters predicted a rise in the number of active cases before a fall to zero, (ii) which predicted a decrease, without rising, in the active cases to zero and (iii) which predicted an increase in the active cases until the entire susceptible population gets infected. It follows that some of the type (iii) windows are of the same or lesser concern when compared to some type (i) windows. Further analysis of the type (iii) windows leads to the identification of those which could be indicators of the start of a new wave of the pandemic. The study thus proposes a method for using the present data for identifying pandemic waves in the near future.","Viswanath, N.

The case of Istanbul, Turkey",2021-03-24,"Diabetes is a chronic disease that is very suitable for telemedicine management. Owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, telemedicine management of diabetes is particularly important. This consensus proposes 38 recommendations for key issues in telemedicine management of diabetes and provides preliminary specifications for diabetes management. It is recommended to use the most current information and communication technologies for telemanagement of patients' diet, exercise, behavior, and drug therapy. A strategy for drug therapy that is more suitable for telemedicine management of diabetes than previous ones is established. During online follow-up visits, major changes of antihyperglycemic agents must be avoided, and treatment modification should be done in a stepwise manner. Greater attention should be paid to the occurrence and prevention of hypoglycemia, in addition to educating patients about the side effects of the drugs used and encouraging them to actively report adverse drug reactions. Conditions are clarified under which online follow-up visits must be terminated and in-person visits or emergency visits must be initiated. Telemedicine can improve the management level and control rate of diabetes. The present consensus for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of diabetes can reduce the potential risks of telemedicine management, yield great benefits to patients, and reduce chronic complications and comorbidities.","Zhang, Bo",Int J Endocrinol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33833798/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6643491,646

Despite the established usefulness of discourse organizational cues for lecture comprehension and note-taking, very little is known about the marking of relevance in this genre. The current overview of lexicogrammatical relevance markers combines a qualitative and quantitative investigation of 160 lectures from the British Academic Spoken English (BASE) corpus. These markers could mostly be classified according to their main element into adjective, noun, verb and adverb patterns. Verb patterns were the most common, followed by noun patterns. The verb pattern V clause (e.g., remember slavery had already been legally abolished) and the noun pattern MN v-link (e.g., the point is) are the predominant types of relevance markers. The discrepancy between the prevalent markers and what may be thought of as prototypical or included in EAP textbooks as relevance markers also demonstrates the need for corpus linguistic research. Implications for EAP course design, teaching English for lecturing purposes, and educational research are discussed.","Deroey, Katrien L.B.; Taverniers, Miriam",English for Specific Purposes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088949061200021X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S088949061200021X,646

Nasopharyngeal swab was done as a prerequisite for admission or prior to admission as part of random testing. Two methods of viral testing were employed: Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (rapid test) and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Either or both tests were done, with the former performed for patients requiring surgery immediately. Surgery was performed within 24–36 h from admission. Peritoneal fluid swabs were obtained for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR test. Swabs were immediately placed in viral transfer media and delivered to the public health laboratory in an ice bag. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in peritoneal swabs. Due to the limited number of patients, further studies are required; yet, protective measures should still be taken by surgeons when dealing with COVID-19 cases.","AlAradi, Jasim; AlHarmi, Rawan A Rahman; AlKooheji, Mariam; Almahari, Sayed Ali; Isa, Mohamed Abdulla; AlMarzooq, Raed",J Surg Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33859814/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jscr/rjab116,646
