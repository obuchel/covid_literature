Sustainable Landscape Regeneration Through Greenways: Towards Project Guidelines for the Sardinia Island (Italy),10.913838,-0.6784494,2020-08-26,"In modern data centers, storage system failures are major contributors to downtimes and maintenance costs. Predicting these failures by collecting measurements from disks and analyzing them with machine learning techniques can effectively reduce their impact, enabling timely maintenance. While there is a vast literature on this subject, most approaches attempt to predict hard disk failures using either classic machine learning solutions, such as Random Forests (RFs) or deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In this work, we address hard disk failure prediction using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), a novel type of deep neural network for time series analysis. Using a real-world dataset, we show that TCNs outperform both RFs and RNNs. Specifically, we can improve the Fault Detection Rate (FDR) of [Formula: see text] 7.5% (FDR = 89.1%) compared to the state-of-the-art, while simultaneously reducing the False Alarm Rate (FAR = 0.052%). Moreover, we explore the network architecture design space showing that TCNs are consistently superior to RNNs for a given model size and complexity and that even relatively small TCNs can reach satisfactory performance. All the codes to reproduce the results presented in this paper are available at https://github.com/ABurrello/tcn-hard-disk-failure-prediction.","Burrello, Alessio; Pagliari, Daniele Jahier; Bartolini, Andrea; Benini, Luca; Macii, Enrico; Poncino, Massimo",Euro-Par 2020: Parallel Processing Workshops,816,7

Through a critical examination of the reasons behind this sudden rise in hate crimes and hate speech, this chapter argues that a new form of nationalism founded based on religious sentiments and animosity among different religious groups is slowly emerging in present-day India. In the process, communalism has come to be conflated with nationalism. Results of this qualitative inquiry suggest that young people are lacking in a thorough understanding of these issues, although they do not appear to be altogether evasive of contemporary realities. This points towards the need for increased public awareness and education delivered through a critical lens, and alerts us to the dangers of overestimating the reach and influence of mass media to convey the magnitude of certain crucial issues.","Maria Agnes Sasitha, J.",Crime Prevention and Justice in 2030,816,7

With the Numba-CUDA, it is even possible to program GPUs with Python using a CUDA like programming style. However, Numba is missing support for CUDA-unified memory, which can help to simplify programming even more and allows dynamic work distribution between GPUs and CPUs. In this work, we implement and evaluate the support for unified memory in Numba. As expected, the performance of unified memory is worse than using explicit data transfers, but can outperform the performance of the implicit methods provided by Numba. Additionally, using unified memory can help to reduce the Python interpreter overhead and therefore help to improve the performance of small problem sizes. The use of system-wide atomic can help to improve the work distribution between GPU and CPU, but when using more CPU threads the performance suffers under the Python global interpreter lock (GIL).","Oden, Lena; Saidi, Tarek",Euro-Par 2020: Parallel Processing Workshops,816,7

Programming models such as message passing are efficient but require low-level management of communications. Higher level of programming such as shared memory are convenient for the application design but they usually have performance issues. With the recent development of distributed heterogeneous systems and new protocols to access remote memories, there is an opportunity for distributed shared memory systems to offer a satisfying level of abstraction while not giving up on performance. In this paper a video processing application is written using MPI, 0MQ and an in-house software-distributed shared memory (S-DSM) backend and deployed over a set of heterogeneous computing boards. Results show that 0MQ implementation is the most efficient but at the price of writing the application with the targeted platform in mind. The S-DSM implementation runs up to 2 times faster than the pure OpenMPI implementation and competes with 0MQ when the data granularity is small.","Cudennec, Loïc; Trabelsi, Kods",Euro-Par 2020: Parallel Processing Workshops,816,7

Digital technologies can be leveraged for documenting and archiving these assets of humanity. In particular, digital museums are established for promoting public understanding and appreciation of cultural heritage. Despite the richness of ICH in China, the development of digital museums of ICH is still in an early stage and mostly from government endeavours. As part of an inter-disciplinary collaborative project involving academic researchers, information professionals, and a private not-for-profit museum, this paper described the development of Gifts from Lanmama, a digital museum of Miao embroidery as a unique ICH from Guizhou ethnic minorities in China. This paper also reported a preliminary evaluation of the digital museum with 78 users, in terms of its usability and affordance for learning about cultural heritage. Results revealed the strengths of the digital museum in terms of the rigor of metadata and its impact on improving users’ understanding and appreciation of Miao embroidery. Some issues and challenges were also identified, such as the lack of channels for user-system communication. These evaluation results offer insights for further improving the digital museum and other end-user oriented digital presentations of similar ICH.","Hu, Xiao; Ng, Jeremy Tzi-Dong; Liu, Ruilun","Diversity, Divergence, Dialogue",816,10

More than two thirds of the European population live in urban areas and this percentage is continuously growing. Therefore, cities are fundamental hubs of the transport system, since most journeys start or end within urban areas. The direct consequence is that many of the negative transport externalities, such as congestion, road accidents and pollution, have the greatest impacts in these contexts. The European Commission emphasized integrated planning at all mobility level to enhance new forms of sustainable urban mobility, in order to reduce externalities associated with transport sector. In this view, the aim of this paper is to analyze the European guidelines for the development and the implementation of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) and the corresponding Italian guidelines for the preparation of so-called “Piani Urbani della Mobilità Sostenibile” (PUMS). A comparative evaluation is proposed to emphasize the new paradigm of sustainable transport planning and highlight critical evidence between the European legal tools and their transposition at national level, also in the light of their recent updates. The results of this analysis lay the basis for the critical assessment of best practices and the review of related SUMP, in order to identify the key elements to assist traffic planners and managers in their decision-making procedures for the identification of successful strategies and the implementation of effective actions towards sustainable mobility.","Torrisi, Vincenza; Garau, Chiara; Ignaccolo, Matteo; Inturri, Giuseppe",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,816,7

All western countries have regulated the management sector of this resource (Integrated Water System – SII), regarding both its distribution as well as the purification and collection of sewage waste. Italy has also moved towards privatizing its management, proposing a collaborative mechanism between the public regulatory Authority and the private operator. The investments for the maintenance and development of the asset are therefore supported by the private investors. The model proposed in this work is based on the use of AHP to encourage the conciliation of opposing interests and rationalize a rather complex regulatory phase. It facilitates the selection of technical investment alternatives for the improvement of the SII supply standards.","Macchiaroli, Maria; Dolores, Luigi; Pellecchia, Vincenzo; De Mare, Gianluigi; Nesticò, Antonio; Maselli, Gabriella",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,816,7

We describe the novel features of this problem, which are based on the possible (but still unexploited) knowledge on the composition of the disaggregated loads in containers and semitrailers entering the port. In this problem, the transportation requests of these loads are highly customized and have different delivery costs. We must determine the paths of vehicles and loads, which result in costs paid by carriers and customers, as well as external costs for the city itself. The resulting network design problem is faced from the holistic viewpoint of a possible mobility manager, which must minimize the overall system costs. We present a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) for this problem. Since it is very difficult to solve by standard MILP solvers, we present a Tabu Search algorithm exploiting the specific problem features. The computational experiments show to what extent this problem can be tackled by a general purpose mixed-integer programming solver and the Tabu Search algorithm.","Di Francesco, Massimo; Incollu, Dennis; Porcu, Claudia; Zanda, Simone",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,816,7

This is highly important since it helps to develop an international and regional retrospective on equal political participation. When measuring the political participation of Ecuadorian women, official data from the National Electoral Council-Ecuador was used, as well as, other state databases. The results of this research indicate that, firstly, there has been a substantial change in the participation of Ecuadorian women’s policy over time, and in the legislation and its application. Secondly, there is a notable gender disparity. Male are mostly seen as candidates for political position such as Mayors, Governors, or Presidents. This reflects cultural marked aspects in the Ecuadorian society. Thirdly, the country is deficient in its vertical parity policy, and does not have a horizontal parity. And finally, this paper shows that the political participation of women in Ecuador depends on the region.","León, Marcelo; Sosa, Wladimir; Guamán, Angélica; Rivera, Rodrigo; Serrano, Mireya",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,816,7

In contrast, the topological approach exploits the structural information of the network, e.g., nodes degree, paths, neighbourhood breadth. For a long time, such approaches have been considered substantially separated. In recent years, following the widespread of social media, an increasing focus has been dedicated to understanding how complex networks develop, following the human phenomena they represent, considering both the meaning of the node and the links structure and distribution. The link prediction problem, aiming at predicting how networks evolve in terms of connections between entities, is suitable to apply semantic similarity measures to a topological domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel topological formulation of semantic measures, e.g., NGD, PMI, Confidence, in a unifying framework for link prediction in social graphs, providing results of systematic experiments. We validate the approach discussing the prediction capability on widely accepted data sets, comparing the performance of the topological formulation of semantic measures to the conventional metrics generally used in literature.","Biondi, Giulio; Franzoni, Valentina",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,816,7

The aim of our paper is to provide an expressive and highly interpretable characterization of microbiome alterations, with the goal of achieving more effective transplantations characterized by a rejection rate as low as possible, and to avoid more severe complications by treating patients at risk in a timely and effective way. For this purpose, we propose using topic models to identify those bacterial species that have the most important weight under the two different experimental conditions (healthy and transplanted patients, or patients whose fecal microbiota has been sampled both in pre- and post-transplantation phases). Topic models are Bayesian statistical models that are not affected by data scarcity, because conclusions we can draw borrow strength across sparse gut microbiome samples. By exploiting this property, we show that topic models are expressive methods for dimensionality reduction which can help analyze variation and diversity in gut microbial communities. With topic models the analysis can be carried out at a level close to natural language, as the output can be easily interpreted by clinicians, since most abundant species are automatically selected and the microbial dynamics can be tracked and followed over time.","Santacroce, Luigi; Mavaddati, Sara; Hamedi, Javad; Zeinali, Bahman; Ballini, Andrea; Bilancia, Massimo",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,816,7

The presence of dust grains in ISM have also been observed, which in the denser regions are covered by thick ice mantles consisting mainly of water molecules. Quantifying the interaction of gas phase species with water ice is essential to accurately model the evolution of the ISM. Hence, the importance to obtain accurate binding energies. In this contribution, the binding energies (BEs) of different N-containing interstellar species on water ice surfaces are presented. They have been calculated by means of reliable periodic quantum chemical simulations. Two different methods have been used: i) hybrid DFT methods, i.e., B3LYP for closed-shells species and M06-2X for open-shell radicals, and ii) the cost-effective DFT//HF-3C, i.e., geometry optimization at HF-3c followed by a single point energy refinement at the DFT level. As a first step, BEs have been computed on a crystalline water ice surface model of a thickness of 12 atomic layers, in which different super cells have been adopted (involving 36 or 72 water molecules per unit cell), depending on the size of the adsorbate. Moreover, an ONIOM-like local approximation combining CCSD(T) with DFT functional as high and low theory levels, respectively, has been adopted to correct BEs.","Martínez-Bachs, Berta; Ferrero, Stefano; Rimola, Albert",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,816,7
