83099,Ischemic monomelic neuropathy. The case for re-introducing a little-known term.,2020-05-04,"The outbreak of a novel coronavirus, referred to as coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), with its sentinel case in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has spread rapidly around the globe. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic, which led to most countries implementing social distancing protocols. Most non-essential medical practices have been halted to direct resources to the facilities caring for patients with COVID infection. The pediatric orthopaedic practice is in a unique position, with the treatment of many conditions being treated by pediatric orthopedists being non-emergent, but time-sensitive. We hereby review the current literature and guidelines surrounding the practice change around the world and give recommendations regarding the practice of pediatric orthopaedics during the COVID pandemic.","Baghdadi, Soroush; Nabian, Mohammad Hossein; Baghdadi, Taghi",The archives of bone and joint surgery,https://doi.org/10.22038/abjs.2020.47715.2340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32733979/,899

METHOD Reflexion based on theoretical aspects and scientific evidence of emotional labor in pediatric nursing. RESULTS Given the repercussions of COVID-19 on children and adolescents, it is up to the nurse to recognize them and nurture a non-traumatic and affectionate care. However, measures to control the disease affect the care provided. In this context, emotional labor process become essential, as they guide the management of the child's and family's emotions, associated with the suffering caused by the pandemic and the nurse's emotional experience when caring. CONCLUSION Emotional support and care processes are essential in pediatrics, especially in a stressful time such as a pandemic, which requires the positive transformation of the intense and disturbing experiences of people for them to achieve psychosocial well-being.","Freitas, Bruna Hinnah Borges Martins de; Costa, Ana Inês Lourenço da; Diogo, Paula Manuela Jorge; Gaíva, Maria Aparecida Munhoz",Revista gaucha de enfermagem,https://doi.org/10.1590/1983-1447.2021.20200217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33787726/,899

They may experience a more severe clinical course due to impaired immune responses. This multi-center retrospective UK audit identified cancer patients who had SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 March and 10 June 2020 and collected data pertaining to cancer history, COVID-19 presentation and outcomes. In total, 179 patients were identified with a median age of 72 (IQR 61, 81) and follow-up of 44 days (IQR 42, 45). Forty-one percent were female and the overall mortality was 37%. Twenty-nine percent had HM and of these, those treated with chemotherapy in the preceding 28 days to COVID-19 diagnosis had worse outcome compared with solid malignancy (SM): 62% versus 19% died [HR 8.33 (95% CI, 2.56-25), p < 0.001]. Definite or probable nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission accounted for 16% of cases and was associated with increased risk of death (HR 2.47, 95% CI 1.43-4.29, p = 0.001). Patients with haematological malignancies and those who acquire nosocomial transmission are at increased risk of death. Therefore, there is an urgent need to reassess shielding advice, reinforce stringent infection control, and ensure regular patient and staff testing to prevent nosocomial transmission.","Bhogal, Talvinder; Khan, Umair T; Lee, Rebecca; Stockdale, Alexander; Hesford, Christian; Potti-Dhananjaya, Vaishnav; Jathanna, Avith; Rahman, Shaun; Tivey, Ann; Shotton, Rohan; Sundar, Ram; Valerio, Christopher; Norouzi, Amir; Walker, Philip; Suckling, Ruth; Armstrong, Anne; Brearton, Gillian; Pettitt, Andrew; Kalakonda, Nagesh; Palmer, Daniel H; Jackson, Richard; Turtle, Lance; Palmieri, Carlo",Leukemia & lymphoma,https://doi.org/10.1080/10428194.2021.1876865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33508995/,899
241969,SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting as a febrile rash,2020,"Nucleic acid amplification for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory samples is the standard method for diagnosis. The majority of this testing is centralised and therefore turnaround times of several days. Point-of-care testing with rapid turnaround times would allow more effective triage in settings where patient management and infection control decisions need to be made rapidly.Inclusivity and specificity of the SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 Test was determined by both in silico analyses of the primers and probes and wet testing. The SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 Test was evaluated for performance characteristics. Clinical performance was evaluated in residual combined throat/nose swabs and compared to the Public Health England real-time PCR assay targeting the RdRp gene.The SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 Test has an analytical sensitivity of 250 cp/mL detecting two regions of the genome (Orf1ab and N). The clinical performance was evaluated in 172 residual combined nose/throat swabs provided by the Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge (CMPHL), which showed an estimated positive percent agreement of 98.9% (95% CI: 93.83-99.97) negative percent agreement of 96.4% (95%CI: 89.92-99.26) compared to testing by CMPHL.The data shows that the SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 Test performs equivalently to the centralised testing methods with shorter turnaround time of 86-101 minutes). Point of care testing, such as SAMBA, should enable rapid patient management and effective implementation of infection control measures.","Assennato, Sonny M; Ritchie, Allyson V; Nadala, Cesar; Goel, Neha; Tie, Cuijuan; Nadala, Lourdes M; Zhang, Hongyi; Datir, Rawlings; Gupta, Ravindra K; Curran, Martin D; Lee, Helen H",J. clin. microbiol,,899
282675,Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and psoriasis: the three things every dermatologist should know,2021,"Many unanswered questions remain regarding the role of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays in this unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. These include their utility for the diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, past infection or exposure, correlation with immunity and the effective duration of immunity. This study examined the performance of three laboratory based serological assays, EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG, MAGLUMI 2000 Plus 2019-nCov IgM/IgG and EDI Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG immunoassays. We evaluated 138 samples from a reference non-infected population and 71 samples from a cohort of 37 patients with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed positive by RT-PCR. The samples were collected at various intervals of 0-45 days post symptoms onset (PSO). Specificity and sensitivity of these assays was 60.9%/71.4% (IgA) and 94.2%/63.3% (IgG) for EUROIMMUN; 98.5%/18.4% (IgM) and 97.8%/53.1% (IgG) for MAGLUMI; and 94.9%/22.5% (IgM) and 93.5%/57.1% (IgG) for EDI, respectively. When samples collected &#8805;14 days PSO were considered, the sensitivities were 100.0 and 100.0%; 31.0 and 82.8%; 34.5 and 57.1%, respectively. Using estimated population prevalence of 0.1, 1, and 10%, the positive predictive value of all assays remained low. The EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA lacked specificity for acute diagnosis and all IgM assays offered poor diagnostic utility. Seroconversion can be delayed although all patients had seroconverted at 28 days in our cohort with the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Despite this, with specificity of only 94% this assay would not be satisfactory for seroprevalence studies in the general Australian population given this is likely to be currently <1%.","Davidson, N; Evans, J; Giammichele, D; Powell, H; Hobson, P; Teis, B; Glover, H; Guppy-Coles, K B; Robson, J",Pathology,,899

354229,Assessment of the Economic and Health-Care Impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on Public and Private Dental Surgeries in Spain: A Pilot Study,2020,"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a growing emergence of “quarantine hotels” that provide accommodation to guests who are mandated to self-isolate for 14 days upon entry to a country to prevent the spread of virus. Why are young hotel workers willing to endure relatively poor working conditions and expose themselves to dangerous COVID-19 workplace environments? Perhaps, the opportunity to participate in meaningful work is the prime motivator for hotel workers who choose to work in quarantine hotels. This study aims to investigate the motivations that young hotel employees hold towards working in a potentially dangerous hotel workplace. Design/methodology/approach: Using personal interviews, this research explored the antecedents behind Generation Z employees’ (n = 42) actual behaviour towards working in quarantine hotels through the lens of the extended theory of planned behaviour (TPB) model (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived difficulties and meaningful work). Findings: Results revealed that meaningful work such as making the world safer and going beyond the call of duty was a key motivating factor behind a willingness to work in quarantine hotels. Hotel employees also viewed working in quarantine hotels as exciting but dangerous, and the support from their family nuclei was seen as a key underlying motivator. Practical implications: The key implications are the image of the hospitality industry in terms of professional identity to be an industry that is respected by society given the high-risk work environment with increased exposure to COVID-19. Even though Generation Z still see some long-standing negatives in hotel work such as long hours and emotional challenge, it is positive to know that there are contexts in which they can have more pride and meaningfulness from their jobs. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper to examine Generation Z hotel workers’ motivations to work in quarantine hotels. A key theoretical contribution to the body of knowledge is the extension of the TPB framework with the additional meaningful work variable. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Goh, E.; Baum, T.",International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management,,899
371964,Occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 during mycophenolate mofetil treatment for pemphigus,2020,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: The use of new lightweight meshes in pelvic organ prolapse (POP) surgery may reduce complications related to mesh retraction (chronic pain, dyspareunia, and mesh exposure). The aim of this study was to investigate changes in the area and position of Uphold Lite&#8482; mesh 6 weeks and 12 months after anterior and/or apical prolapse repair. METHODS: This observational prospective multicenter study included patients who had undergone transvaginal surgery for symptomatic POP-Q stage &#8805; II anterior and/or apical compartment prolapse with placement of Uphold Lite mesh. The dimensions and position of the mesh were evaluated at 6 weeks and 12 months by ultrasonography. Correlations between ultrasonographic mesh characteristics and POP recurrence were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty evaluable women with an average age of 66.8 years were included. No statistically significant difference in mesh area was found between week 6 and month 12 postoperatively, either at rest (1746.92 vs. 1574.48 mm2; p = 0.15) or on Valsalva (1568.81 vs. 1542.98 mm2; p = 0.65). The ROC-AUC of the distance between the mesh and the bladder neck (M-BN) at 6 weeks for predicting cystocele recurrence at 12 months was 0.764 (95% CI 0.573-0.955) at rest and 0.724 (95% CI 0.533-0.916) on Valsalva. An M-BN distance > 12.5 mm could predict cystocele recurrence at month 12 with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 69%. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonographic measurements of the Uphold Lite&#8482; mesh appear to remain stable between 6 weeks and 12 months postoperatively. M-BN distance correlates with cystocele recurrence. These results appear to confirm the value of ultrasound in mesh evaluation.","Allègre, Lucie; Callewaert, Geertje; Coudray, Charles; Demattei, Christophe; Panel, Laure; Carlier-Guerin, Caroline; Letouzey, Vincent; de Tayrac, Renaud; Fatton, Brigitte",Int. urogynecol. j.

371965,Occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 during mycophenolate mofetil treatment for pemphigus,2020,"The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been emerged as a rapidly spreading pandemic. The disease is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry. Although the majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the acinar airways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the acinar airways. While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid to how SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells. The aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated droplets and aerosol particles. For this purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Particle size distribution, breathing parameters supposing normal breathing through the nose, and viral loads were taken from the literature. We found that the probability of direct infection of the acinar airways due to inhalation of particles emitted by a bystander cough is very low. As the number of viruses deposited in the extrathoracic airways is about 7 times higher than in the acinar airways, we concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. Our results suggest that without the enhancement of viral load in the upper airways, COVID-19 would be much less dangerous. The period between the onset of initial symptoms and the potential clinical deterioration could provide an opportunity for prevention of pneumonia by blocking or significantly reducing the transport of viruses towards the acinar airways. Therefore, even non-specific treatment forms like disinfection of the throat and nasal and oral mucosa may effectively keep the viral load of the upper airways low enough to avoid or prolong the progression of the disease. In addition, using a tissue or cloth in order to absorb droplets and aerosol particles emitted by own coughs of infected patients before re-inhalation is highly recommended even if they are alone in quarantine.","Madas, Balázs G; Füri, Péter; Farkas, Árpád; Nagy, Attila; Czitrovszky, Aladár; Balásházy, Imre; Schay, Gusztáv G; Horváth, Alpár",Sci Rep,,899

I develop a behavioral dynamic epidemic model for multifaceted policy analysis comprising endogenous virus transmission (from severe or mild/asymptomatic cases), social contacts, and case testing and reporting. Calibration of the system dynamics model to the ongoing outbreak (31 December 2019-15 May 2020) using multiple time series data (reported cases and deaths, performed tests, and social interaction proxies) from six countries (South Korea, Germany, Italy, France, Sweden, and the United States) informs an explanatory analysis of outbreak responses and postpeak strategies. Specifically, I demonstrate, first, how timing and efforts of testing-capacity expansion and social-contact reduction interplay to affect outbreak dynamics and can explain a large share of cross-country variation in outbreak pathways. Second, absent at-scale availability of pharmaceutical solutions, postpeak social contacts must remain well below prepandemic values. Third, proactive (targeted) interventions, when complementing general deconfinement readiness, can considerably increase admissible postpeak social contacts. © 2020 System Dynamics Society.","Struben, Jeroen",,,899

PURPOSE: To investigate the difference between the patient background of both CAFL and AF in the non-elderly. METHODS: In 526 consecutive patients who underwent catheter ablation of clinical paroxysmal/persistent CAFL or AF in our hospital, we enrolled only patients under 60 years old. Cases harboring both AFL and AF were excluded. We analyzed the patient characteristics, echocardiographic findings, electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities during sinus rhythm, and clinical course after ablation. RESULTS: In total, 196 patients (Cohort 1: 142 males, 156 AF cases) were analyzed. AFL patients were younger than AF patients (47.4 ± 10.6 vs. 50.2 ± 6.4years, p = 0.031) and organic heart disease (OHD) was significantly more common in AFL patients than AF patients (42.5% vs. 11.5%, p<0.001). In 161 patients excluding OHD (Cohort 2), ECG abnormalities were more frequent in AFL than in AF patients (78.3% vs. 39.1%, p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in all-cause death, onset of heart failure, and cerebral strokes. On the other hand, the number of cases that required a pacemaker was significantly higher in the CAFL group than AF group (0.0% vs. 26.1%, p-value <0.001). These results suggested that CAFL may reflect occurrence of any atrial myocardial damage, even if it does not lead to heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: Our present study suggested that CAFL may be associated with a broader atrial myocardial disorder in non-elderly patients.","Takahira, Haruhiro; Kajiyama, Takatsugu; Kondo, Yusuke; Nakano, Masahiro; Nakano, Miyo; Ito, Ryo; Kitagawa, Mari; Sugawara, Masafumi; Chiba, Toshinori; Kobayashi, Yoshio",J. cardiol.,,899

437011,"SARS-CoV-2, skin lesions and the need of a multidisciplinary approach",2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which at the time of writing (January 2021) was responsible for more than 2.25 million deaths worldwide and over 100,000 deaths in the UK. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly transmissible and could rapidly spread in residential care homes. OBJECTIVE: The work undertaken aimed to estimate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of viral detection point-of-care tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 compared with laboratory-based tests in the setting of a hypothetical care home facility for elderly residents. PERSPECTIVE/SETTING: The perspective was that of the NHS in 2020. The setting was a hypothetical care home facility for elderly residents. Care homes with en suite rooms and with shared facilities were modelled separately. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was constructed to model individual residents and simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 once it had entered the residential care facility. The numbers of COVID-19-related deaths and critical cases were recorded in addition to the number of days spent in isolation. Thirteen strategies involving different hypothetical SARS-CoV-2 tests were modelled. Recently published desirable and acceptable target product profiles for SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests and for hospital-based SARS-CoV-2 tests were modelled. Scenario analyses modelled early release from isolation based on receipt of a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result and the impact of vaccination. Incremental analyses were undertaken using both incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefits. RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness results depended on the proportion of residential care facilities penetrated by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests with desirable target product profiles appear to have high net monetary benefit values. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests with acceptable target product profiles had low net monetary benefit values because of unnecessary isolations. The benefit of allowing early release from isolation depended on whether or not the facility had en suite rooms. The greater the assumed efficacy of vaccination, the lower the net monetary benefit values associated with SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests, when assuming that a vaccine lowers the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. LIMITATIONS: There is considerable uncertainty in the values for key parameters within the model, although calibration was undertaken in an attempt to mitigate this. Some degree of Monte Carlo sampling error persists because of the timelines of the project. The example care home simulated will also not match those of decision-makers deciding on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of introducing SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests. Given these limitations, the results should be taken as indicative rather than definitive, particularly the cost-effectiveness results when the relative cost per SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test is uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests have considerable potential for benefit for use in residential care facilities, but whether or not this materialises depends on the diagnostic accuracy and costs of forthcoming SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests. FUTURE WORK: More accurate results would be obtained when there is more certainty on the diagnostic accuracy of and the reduction in time to test result associated with SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests when used in the context of residential care facilities, the proportion of care home penetrated by SARS-CoV-2 and the levels of immunity once vaccination is administered. These parameters are currently uncertain. FUNDING: This report was commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Evidence Synthesis programme as project number 132154.

In addition to having a significant impact on daily life, it also shows its effect in different areas, including public health and economy. Currently, there is no vaccine or antiviral drug available to prevent the COVID-19 disease. Therefore, determination of protein interactions of new types of corona virus is vital in clinical studies, drug therapy, identification of preclinical compounds and protein functions. Protein-protein interactions are important to examine protein functions and pathways involved in various biological processes and to determine the cause and progression of diseases. Various high-throughput experimental methods have been used to identify protein-protein interactions in organisms, yet, there is still a huge gap in specifying all possible protein interactions in an organism. In addition, since the experimental methods used include cloning, labeling, affinity purification mass spectrometry, the processes take a long time. Determining these interactions with artificial intelligence-based methods rather than experimental approaches may help to identify protein functions faster. Thus, protein-protein interaction prediction using deep-learning algorithms has been employed in conjunction with experimental method to explore new protein interactions. However, to predict protein interactions with artificial intelligence techniques, protein sequences need to be mapped. There are various types and numbers of protein-mapping methods in the literature. In this study, we wanted to contribute to the literature by proposing a novel protein-mapping method based on the AVL tree. The proposed method was inspired by the fast search performance on the dictionary structure of AVL tree and was used to verify the protein interactions between SARS-COV-2 virus and human. First, protein sequences were mapped by both the proposed method and various protein-mapping methods. Then, the mapped protein sequences were normalized and classified by bidirectional recurrent neural networks. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated with accuracy, f1-score, precision, recall, and AUC scores. Our results indicated that our mapping method predicts the protein interactions between SARS-COV-2 virus proteins and human proteins at an accuracy of 97.76%, precision of 97.60%, recall of 98.33%, f1-score of 79.42%, and with AUC 89% in average.","Alakus, Talha Burak; Turkoglu, Ibrahim",Interdiscip. sci.: comput. life sci.

In the light of the recent data highlighting an association between COVID-19 and diabetes, a detailed analysis aimed at evaluating ACE2 expression pattern distribution in human pancreas is still lacking. Here, we took advantage of INNODIA network EUnPOD biobank collection to thoroughly analyse ACE2, both at mRNA and protein level, in multiple human pancreatic tissues and using several methodologies. Using multiple reagents and antibodies, we showed that ACE2 is expressed in human pancreatic islets, where it is preferentially expressed in subsets of insulin producing β-cells. ACE2 is also is highly expressed in pancreas microvasculature pericytes and moderately expressed in rare scattered ductal cells. By using different ACE2 antibodies we showed that a recently described short-ACE2 isoform is also prevalently expressed in human β-cells. Finally, using RT-qPCR, RNA-seq and High-Content imaging screening analysis, we demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines, but not palmitate, increases ACE2 expression in the β-cell line EndoC-βH1 and in primary human pancreatic islets. Taken together, our data indicate a potential link between SARS-CoV-2 and diabetes through putative infection of pancreatic microvasculature and/or ductal cells and/or through direct β-cell virus tropism.","Fignani, Daniela; Licata, Giada; Brusco, Noemi; Nigi, Laura; Grieco, Giuseppina E.; Marselli, Lorella; Overbergh, Lut; Gysemans, Conny; Colli, Maikel L.; Marchetti, Piero; Mathieu, Chantal; Eizirik, Decio L.; Sebastiani, Guido; Dotta, Francesco",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.23.208041,899

686085,"COVID-19 in a Long-Term Care Facility — King County, Washington, February 27–March 9, 2020",2020-03-27,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare quantifiable radiologic findings and their dynamic change throughout the clinical course of common and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to provide valuable evidence for radiologic classification of the two types of this disease. METHODS: 112 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Volumetric percentage of infection and density of the lung were measured by a computer-aided software. Clinical parameters were recorded to reflect disease progression. Baseline data and dynamic change were compared between two groups and a decision-tree algorithm was developed to determine the cut-off value for classification. RESULTS: 93 patients were finally included and were divided into common group (n = 76) and severe group (n = 17) based on current criteria. Compared with common patients, severe patients experienced shorter advanced stage, peak time and plateau, but longer absorption stage. The dynamic change of volume and density coincided with the clinical course. The interquartile range of volumetric percentage of the two groups were 1.0–7.2% and 11.4–31.2%, respectively. Baseline volumetric percentage of infection was significantly higher in severe group, and the cut-off value of it was 10.10%. CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric percentage between severe and common patients was significantly different. Because serial CT scans are systemically performed in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, this quantitative analysis can simultaneously provide valuable information for physicians to evaluate their clinical course and classify common and severe patients accurately.","Yang, Chongtu; Cao, Guijuan; Liu, Fen; Liu, Jiacheng; Huang, Songjiang; Xiong, Bin",Chin J Acad Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33846699/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42058-021-00061-7,899
