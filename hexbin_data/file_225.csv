682,682,682,Do expert assessments converge? An exploratory case study of evaluating and managing a blood supply risk,20.405355,1.6454886,2011-08-24,"BACKGROUND: Examining professional assessments of a blood product recall/withdrawal and its implications for risk and public health, the paper introduces ideas about perceptions of minimal risk and its management. It also describes the context of publicly funded blood transfusion in Canada and the withdrawal event that is the basis of this study. METHODS: Interviews with 45 experts from administration, medicine, blood supply, laboratory services and risk assessment took place using a multi-level sampling framework in the aftermath of the recall. These experts either directly dealt with the withdrawal or were involved in the management of the blood supply at the national level. Data from these interviews were coded in NVivo for analysis and interpretation. Analytically, data were interpreted to derive typifications to relate interview responses to risk management heuristics. RESULTS: While all those interviewed agreed on the importance of patient safety, differences in the ways in which the risk was contextualized and explicated were discerned. Risk was seen in terms of patient safety, liability or precaution. These different risk logics are illustrated by selected quotations. CONCLUSIONS: Expert assessments did not fully converge and it is possible that these different risk logics and discourses may affect the risk management process more generally, although not necessarily in a negative way. Patient safety is not to be compromised but management of blood risk in publicly funded systems may vary. We suggest ways of managing blood risk using formal and safety case approaches.","Eyles, John; Heddle, Nancy; Webert, Kathryn; Arnold, Emmy; McCurdy, Bronwen",BMC Public Health,225,30
1209,1209,1209,Cosmopolitanism and foreign policy for health: ethics for and beyond the state,20.168274,1.970495,2013-07-08,"BACKGROUND: Foreign policy holds great potential to improve the health of a global citizenship. Our contemporary political order is, in part, characterized by sovereign states acting either in opposition or cooperation with other sovereign states. This order is also characterized by transnational efforts to address transnational issues such as those featured so prominently in the area of global health, such as the spread of infectious disease, health worker migration and the movement of health-harming products. These two features of the current order understandably create tension for truly global initiatives. DISCUSSION: National security has become the dominant ethical frame underlying the health-based foreign policy of many states, despite the transnational nature of many contemporary health challenges. This ethical approach engages global health as a means to achieving national security objectives. Implicit in this ethical frame is the version of humanity that dichotomizes between “us” and “them”. What has been left out of this discourse, for the most part, is the role that foreign policy can play in extending the responsibility of states to protect and promote health of the other, for the sake of the other. SUMMARY: The principal purpose of this paper is to review arguments for a cosmopolitan ethics of health-based foreign policy. I will argue that health-based foreign policy that is motivated by security interests is lacking both morally and practically to further global health goals. In other words, a cosmopolitan ethic is not only intrinsically superior as a moral ideal, but also has potential to contribute to utilitarian ends. This paper draws on the cosmopolitanism literature to build robust support for foreign policies that contribute to sustainable systems of global health governance.","Lencucha, Raphael",BMC Int Health Hum Rights,225,5

Many post-Ebola health system strengthening programmes are framed around a notion of health system ‘resilience’ that focuses on global rather than local priorities and fails to account for key local social dynamics that shape crisis responses. Post-crisis health system strengthening efforts require a shift towards a more ‘people-centred’ understanding of resilience that attends to the people, relationships and local contexts that constitute health systems and the practices that produce crisis responses.","Martineau, Fred P.",Int Health,225,5

Bed occupancy rates often surpass the good hospital bed management threshold of 85%, which can result in poor conditions in the workplace. This study explores how QoC-scores could be improved by investing in additional beds and/or better vaccination programs against vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. METHODS: The Cobb–Douglas model was selected to define the improvement in QoC (%) as a function of two strategies (rotavirus vaccination coverage [%] and addition of extra hospital beds [% of existing beds]), allowing improvement-isocurves to be produced. Subsequently, budget minimization was applied to determine the combination of the two strategies needed to reach a given QoC improvement at the lowest cost. Data from Jessa Hospital (Hasselt, Belgium) were chosen as an example. The annual population in the catchment area to be vaccinated was 7000 children; the winter period was 90 days with 34 pediatric beds available. Rotavirus vaccination cost per course was €118.26 and the daily cost of a pediatric bed was €436.53. The target QoC increase was fixed at 50%. The model was first built with baseline parameter values. RESULTS: The model predicted that a combination of 64% vaccine coverage and 39% extra hospital beds (≈ 13 extra beds) in winter would improve QoC-scores by 50% for the minimum budget allocation. CONCLUSION: The model allows determination of the most efficient allocation of the healthcare budget between rotavirus vaccination and bed expansion for improving QoC-scores during the annual epidemic winter seasons.","Dort, Thibaut; Schecroun, Nadia; Standaert, Baudouin",Appl Health Econ Health Policy,225,5

We aimed to (1) identify levels of emotion, perceived risk and behaviour change with regard to visiting Salisbury, 1 month after three people were poisoned with a nerve agent; and (2) test whether factors including receipt of information, beliefs about personal exposure and trust in government were associated with these outcomes. DESIGN: A cross-sectional telephone survey of a random sample of Salisbury residents. SETTING: Conducted between 5 and 13 April 2018. PARTICIPANTS: 500 residents aged 18 or over. OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported anxiety, anger, uncertainty, perceived risk to self and avoidance of Salisbury. RESULTS: Any degree of anxiety, anger and uncertainty was reported by 40.6%, 29.8% and 30.6% of participants, respectively. For the majority, the level of emotion reported was mild. Only 7.0% met the criteria for high anxiety and 5.2% reported feeling any risk to their health, whereas 18.6% reported avoiding Salisbury. Factors associated with avoidance of Salisbury included being female, unable to rule out exposure for oneself or of loved ones, believing the incident was targeted against the general public, and lower trust in the government and responding agencies. Hearing a lot or a little about the recovery support (eg, financial packages), as opposed to nothing at all, and being satisfied with this information were associated with reduced avoidance. CONCLUSIONS: Although the March 2018 Salisbury incident had a relatively modest impact on emotion and risk perception in the community, the number who reported avoiding the city was notable. In this, and in future incidents, assuring people that contamination resulted from a targeted, rather than indiscriminate, incident; demonstrating that contamination is contained within specific areas; improving communication about any financial support; and promoting trust in responding agencies should help provide additional reassurance to the community.","Rubin, G James; Webster, Rebecca; Amlot, Richard; Carter, Holly; Weston, Dale; Wessely, Simon",BMJ Open,225,5
14748,14748,14748,Blending an implementation science framework with principles of proportionate universalism to support physical activity promotion in primary healthcare while addressing health inequities,20.423592,1.9797355,2021-01-18,"BACKGROUND: Several vaccine and antibody candidates are currently in development for the prevention of lower respiratory tract infections caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and SCOPUS and included model-based evaluations of RSV vaccinations. Two reviewers performed the selection, data extraction, and quality evaluation with EVIDEM. Cost-effectiveness (CE) estimates were converted to $US purchasing power parity (PPP), year 2018 values. Potential economic and epidemiological outcomes were summarised for maternal, infant, children, and elderly vaccinations. The PROSPERO identifier is CRD42019122570. RESULTS: In total, 22 model-based studies were reviewed. On average, a potential 27% reduction in RSV hospitalisations in infants was projected for maternal vaccination and 50% for direct infant immunisation. The CE of maternal vaccination was $US1766–5857 PPP 2018/disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi)-eligible countries. For England, the maximum cost-effective price of maternal vaccination was estimated at $US81.5 PPP 2018. Infant vaccination was associated with higher CE ratios in low- and high-income settings. Vaccination of neonates born before the RSV season was the most cost effective in high-income settings. Higher values for vaccine effectiveness, duration of protection, and vaccine uptake increased the benefits. Due to indirect effects, the vaccination of school-age children and a cocooning strategy were effective alternatives to protect infants, and the vaccination of children aged < 5 years had a beneficial impact on the elderly. CONCLUSION: RSV vaccines with anticipated characteristics may reduce a sizeable proportion of the RSV burden. The results are subject to uncertainty because of the limited epidemiological and clinical data. Data on RSV incidence and hospitalisation risk for granular age strata should be prioritised to facilitate the evaluation of RSV interventions and decision making.

15486,15486,15486,Availability and funding of clinical genomic sequencing globally,20.301619,1.775631,2021-02-11,"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: Systematic screening for social determinants of health (SDOH), such as food and housing insecurity, is increasingly implemented in primary care, particularly in the context of Accountable Care Organizations (ACO). Despite the importance of developing effective systems for SDOH resource linkage, there is limited research examining these processes. The objective of the study was to explore facilitators and barriers to addressing SDOH identified by systematic screening in a healthcare system participating in a Medicaid ACO. METHODS: This qualitative case study took place between January and March 2020. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with fifteen staff (8 community resource staff and 7 managers) from community health centers and hospitals affiliated with a large healthcare system. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using the Framework Method. RESULTS: Facilitators for addressing SDOH included maintaining updated resource lists, collaborating with community organizations, having leadership buy-in, and developing a trusting relationship with patients. Barriers to addressing SDOH included high caseloads, time constraints, inefficiencies in tracking, lack of community resources, and several specific patient characteristics. Further, resource staff expressed distress associated with having to communicate to patients that they were unable to address certain needs. CONCLUSIONS: Health system, community, and individual-level facilitators and barriers should be considered when developing programs for addressing SDOH. Specifically, the psychological burden on resource staff is an important and underappreciated factor that could impact patient care and lead to staff burnout.","Browne, Julia; Mccurley, Jessica L.; Fung, Vicki; Levy, Douglas E.; Clark, Cheryl R.; Thorndike, Anne N.",J Prim Care Community Health,225,5

The resulting CRY1b RNAi rice lines expressed less CRY1b mRNA, but not CRY1a or CRY2 mRNA, suggesting that the suppression is specific to CRY1b. The growth of CRY1b RNAi rice seedlings was enhanced under blue light compared to wild-type growth, providing phenotypic evidence for impaired CRY function. When these CRY1b RNAi rice plants were challenged with cadmium to induce melatonin, wild-type plants produced 100 ng/g fresh weight (FW) melatonin, whereas CRY1b RNAi lines produced 60 ng/g FW melatonin on average, indicating that melatonin biosynthesis requires the CRY photoreceptor. Due to possible feedback regulation, the expression of melatonin biosynthesis genes such as T5H, SNAT1, SNAT2, and COMT was elevated in the CRY1b RNAi lines compared to the wild-type plants. In addition, laminar angles decreased in the CRY1b RNAi lines via the suppression of brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis genes such as DWARF. The main cause of the BR decrease in the CRY1b RNAi lines seems to be the suppression of CRY rather than decreased melatonin because the melatonin decrease suppressed DWARF4 rather than DWARF.","Hwang, Ok Jin; Back, Kyoungwhan",Molecules,225,5

Patients with severe COPD often fail to receive adequate palliative care and are subject to undesired hospital transfers and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Although promoting advance care planning (ACP) in the community can help ensure the optimal delivery of palliative care for patients with COPD, the key challenges to routinely implementing ACP are not known. The aim of this study was to identify the perception of healthcare professionals with regard to ACP for adults living with severe COPD and the challenges to facilitating ACP. A multicenter qualitative study design was used. In-depth semistructured interviews were held involving 38 healthcare professionals from 19 institutions in Japan. Text data were analyzed by content analysis. Five main themes capturing the challenges to routine implementation of ACP were identified: daily decision-making; sense of ethical decision-making; in-depth interviewing skills; collaborative information sharing among team members; and knowledge dissemination regarding ACP. The model demonstrates the complexity inherent in ACP facilitation for community-dwelling adults with severe COPD, with all the elements required for successful ACP implementation. We recommend an approach that recognizes the importance of stakeholder education, particularly educating professionals to develop the knowledge, attitudes, and skills required for ACP facilitation: in-depth interviewing, collaborative information sharing, and ethical analysis, focusing on decision-making concerning everyday life support.","Hirakawa, Yoshihisa; Aita, Kaoruko; Nishikawa, Mitsunori; Arai, Hidenori; Miura, Hisayuki",Home Healthc Now,225,5

(Fabaceae). The details, however, are highly fragmented in different journals, libraries, and other publication media. This study was therefore conducted to provide a comprehensive report on its ethnobotany, ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemicals, and the available pharmacological evidence supporting its efficacy and safety in traditional medicine. METHOD: We collected data using a PROSPERO registered systematic review protocol on the ethnobotany, phytochemistry, and ethnopharmacology of Erythrina abyssinica from 132 reports that were retrieved from electronic databases. Documented local names, morphology, growth habit and habitat, ethnomedicinal and nonmedicinal uses, diseases treated, parts used, method of preparation and administration, extraction and chemical identity of isolated compounds, and efficacy and toxicity of extracts and isolated compounds were captured. Numerical data were summarized into means, percentages, and frequencies and presented as graphs and tables. RESULTS: Erythrina abyssinica is harvested by traditional herbal medicine practitioners in East, Central, and South African communities to prepare herbal remedies for various human and livestock ailments. These include bacterial and fungal infections, tuberculosis, malaria, HIV/AIDS, diarrhea, cancer, meningitis, inflammatory diseases, urinary tract infections, wounds, diabetes mellitus, and skin and soft tissue injuries. Different extracts and phytochemicals from parts of E. abyssinica have been scientifically proven to possess anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, antiplasmodial, antiproliferative, antifungal, antimycobacterial, antidiarrheal, anti-HIV 1, antidiabetic, and antiobesity activities. This versatile pharmacological activity is due to the abundant flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenoids present in its different parts. CONCLUSION: Erythrina abyssinica is an important ethnomedicinal plant in Africa harboring useful pharmacologically active phytochemicals against various diseases with significant efficacies and minimal toxicity to mammalian cells. Therefore, this plant should be conserved and its potential to provide novel molecules against diseases be explored further.

However, the gender pay gap among the healthcare workforce persists. The objective of this study is to estimate the gender pay gap in the US federal governmental public health workforce during 2010–2018. METHODS: We used an administrative dataset including annual pay rates and job characteristics of employees of the US Department of Health and Human Services. Employees’ gender was classified based on first names. Regression analyses were used to estimate the gender pay gap using the predicted gender. RESULTS: Female employees of the DHHS earned about 13% less than men in 2010, and 9.2% less in 2018. Occupation, pay plan, and location explained more than half of the gender pay gap. Controlling for job grade further reduces the gap. The unexplained portion of the gender pay gap in 2018 was between 1.0 and 3.5%. Female employees had a slight advantage in terms of pay increase over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: While the gender pay gap has narrowed within the last two decades, the pay gap between female and male employees in the federal governmental public health workforce persists and warrants continuing attention and research.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: A secondary analysis of a prospective multicentre observational study in five European EDs (the TRIAGE study), including consecutive children aged <16 years who were discharged following their initial ED visit (‘index’ visit), in 2012–2015. Standardised data on patient characteristics, Manchester Triage System urgency classification, vital signs, clinical interventions and procedures were collected. The outcome measure was serious illness defined as hospital admission or PICU admission or death in ED after an unplanned revisit within 7 days of the index visit. Prediction models were developed using multivariable logistic regression using characteristics of the index visit to predict the likelihood of a revisit with a serious illness. The clinical model included day and time of presentation, season, age, gender, presenting problem, triage urgency, and vital signs. An extended model added laboratory investigations, imaging, and intravenous medications. Cross validation between the five sites was performed, and discrimination and calibration were assessed using random effects models. A digital calculator was constructed for clinical implementation. 7,891 children out of 98,561 children had a revisit to the ED (8.0%), of whom 1,026 children (1.0%) returned to the ED with a serious illness. Rates of revisits with serious illness varied between the hospitals (range 0.7–2.2%). The clinical model had a summary Area under the operating curve (AUC) of 0.70 (95% CI 0.65–0.74) and summary calibration slope of 0.83 (95% CI 0.67–0.99). 4,433 children (5%) had a risk of > = 3%, which was useful for ruling in a revisit with serious illness, with positive likelihood ratio 4.41 (95% CI 3.87–5.01) and specificity 0.96 (95% CI 0.95–0.96). 37,546 (39%) had a risk <0.5%, which was useful for ruling out a revisit with serious illness (negative likelihood ratio 0.30 (95% CI 0.25–0.35), sensitivity 0.88 (95% CI 0.86–0.90)).

There is no licensed antiviral treatment for either of the two abovementioned viruses. Bearing in mind that the antiviral effect of indole alkaloids has been reported for other arboviral models, the present study proposed to evaluate the antiviral in vitro and in silico effects of four indole alkaloids on infections by these two viruses in different cell lines. METHODS: The antiviral effects of voacangine (VOAC), voacangine-7-hydroxyindolenine (VOAC-OH), rupicoline and 3-oxo voacangine (OXO-VOAC) were evaluated in Vero, U937 and A549 cells using different experimental strategies (Pre, Trans, Post and combined treatment). Viral infection was quantified by different methodologies, including infectious viral particles by plating, viral genome by RT-qPCR, and viral protein by cell ELISA. Moreover, molecular docking was used to evaluate the possible interactions between structural and nonstructural viral proteins and the compounds. The results obtained from the antiviral strategies for each experimental condition were compared in all cases with the untreated controls. Statistically significant differences were identified using a parametric Student’s t-test. In all cases, p values below 0.05 (p < 0.05) were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In the pre-treatment strategy in Vero cells, VOAC and VOAC-OH inhibited both viral models and OXO-VOAC inhibited only ZIKV; in U937 cells infected with CHIKV/Col, only VOAC-OH inhibited infection, but none of the compounds had activity in A549 cells; in U937 cells and A549 cells infected with ZIKV/Col, the three compounds that were effective in Vero cells also had antiviral activity. In the trans-treatment strategy, only VOAC-OH was virucidal against ZIKV/Col. In the post-treatment strategy, only rupicoline was effective in the CHIKV/Col model in Vero and A549 cells, whereas VOAC and VOAC-OH inhibited ZIKV infection in all three cell lines. In the combined strategy, VOAC, VOAC-OH and rupicoline inhibited CHIKV/Col and ZIKV/Col, but only rupicoline improved the antiviral effect of ZIKV/Col-infected cultures with respect to the individual strategies. Molecular docking showed that all the compounds had favorable binding energies with the structural proteins E2 and NSP2 (CHIKV) and E and NS5 (ZIKV). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that indole alkaloids are promising antiviral drugs in the process of ZIKV and CHIKV infection; however, the mechanisms of action evaluated in this study would indicate that the effect is different in each viral model and, in turn, dependent on the cell line.

It is based on the application of biotechnological techniques on insects or their cells to develop products or services for human use. Such products are then applied in agriculture, medicine, and industrial biotechnology. Insect biotechnology has proven to be a useful resource in diverse industries, especially for the production of industrial enzymes including chitinases and cellulases, pharmaceuticals, microbial insecticides, insect genes, and many other substances. Insect cells (ICs), and particularly lepidopteran cells, constitute a competitive strategy to mammalian cells for the manufacturing of biotechnology products. Among the wide range of methods and expression hosts available for the production of biotech products, ICs are ideal for the production of complex proteins requiring extensive posttranslational modification. The progress so far made in insect biotechnology essentially derives from scientific breakthroughs in molecular biology, especially with the advances in techniques that allow genetic manipulation of organisms and cells. Insect biotechnology has grown tremendously in the last 30 years.","Ejiofor, Anthony O.",Short Views on Insect Genomics and Proteomics,225,5

Aromatic anticonvulsants and allopurinol are the most frequent causative agents. However, various reports of antibiotic-induced DRESS are available. In this review, we try to summarize reports of antibacterial antibiotic-induced DRESS focusing on characteristics of DRESS induced by each antibiotic group. METHODS: The data were collected by searching PubMed/MEDLINE and ScienceDirect. The keywords used as search terms were “DRESS syndrome,” “drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS),” “antibiotics,” “antimicrobial,” and names of various antimicrobial groups. Finally, 254 relevant cases with a definite or probable diagnosis of DRESS based on RegiSCAR criteria were found until 30 May 2020 and reviewed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Totally, 254 cases of antibacterial antibiotic-induced DRESS are reported. Most of them are related to antituberculosis drugs, vancomycin, and sulfonamides, respectively. Rash and fever were most frequent clinical findings. Eosinophilia and liver injury were the most reported hematologic and visceral organ involvement, respectively. Most of the patients are managed with systemic corticosteroids. The death occurred in 16 patients which most of them experienced liver or lung involvement. The reactivation of various viruses especially HHV-6 is reported in 33 cases. The mean latency period was 29 days. It is necessary to perform thorough epidemiological, genetic, and immunological studies, also systematic case review and causality assessment, as well as well-designed clinical trials for better management of antibiotic-induced DRESS.

Three peptide sequences (85–111, 117–143, and 157–165) derived from immunodominant regions of NY-ESO-1 were selected. These peptides have a wide HLA coverage and were efficiently processed and presented by dendritic cells via various HLA subtypes. Co-delivery of IMM60 enhanced CD4 and CD8 T cell responses and antibody levels against NY-ESO-1 in vivo. Moreover, the nanoparticles have negligible systemic toxicity in high doses, and they could be produced according to GMP guidelines.

The study aims to explore the relationship between the two educational technology tools and three dimensions of student engagement. Using an adopted and revised questionnaire from previous researches, the study measures the extent of impact of the specified educational technology tools on student engagement with the help of SPSS. Through the independent sample T tests, analysis of variance, correlation and regression, the study found that emotional engagement has the strongest positive effect on educational technology engagement. In addition, analysis of the four principal factors indicates that using LMS could engage students more than adopting social networking systems.

The online anatomy dissections by faculty replaced the traditional practice of onsite dissection laboratory periods by the students. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The PA gross anatomy course was scheduled for six weeks, Monday through Thursday. The PA students were offsite and, therefore, viewed the dissections via zoom sessions. Each online session was scheduled for three hours. At the beginning of each session, ten quiz questions relative to prior sessions were asked to enhance students’ retention and recall. Following the daily online practical quizzes, students watched step by step dissections by the faculty. These dissections were integrated with relevant power‐point slides and/or cross‐sections. During last 35 minutes of each daily session, students were divided into small groups to discuss the dissected anatomy region for that day with one faculty member per group. The PA students from the Class of 2022 completed an anonymous electronic survey at the conclusion of the course. RESULTS: The online survey of the enrolled PA students (n=60) in their first‐year training identified that the online dissections and the teaching format were extremely beneficial to their learning. Ninety percent of the students strongly agreed or agreed that online gross anatomy course augmented their learning. Eighty percent of the students strongly agreed or agreed that the streaming of anatomy dissections was helpful in learning the assigned anatomy. Ninety percent of the students strongly agreed or agreed that integrated power point presentations were beneficial, and ninety percent of the students strongly agreed or agreed that daily integrated quizzes (self‐assessment modules) were beneficial for their retention and recall. Although setting up online dissections and integrating the streaming dissections with relevant power points were time‐intensive, the teaching faculty viewed the online teaching experiences as efficient means to further develop students’ knowledge base of anatomy while addressing university and CDC guidelines.","Nonabur, Venkatesh; Rarey, Kyle; Maxey, Amanda",FASEB J,225,1

However, little information is available regarding the genetic polymorphism of pfsra. To determine the extent of genetic variation about P. falciparum by characterizing the sra sequence, 74 P. falciparum samples were collected from migrant workers who returned to China from 12 countries of Africa between 2015 and 2019. The full length of the sra gene was amplified and sequenced. The average pairwise nucleotide diversities (π) of P. falciparum sra gene was 0.00132, and the haplotype diversity (Hd) was 0.770. The average number of nucleotide differences (k) for pfsra was 3.049. The ratio of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions across sites (dN/dS) was 1.365. Amino acid substitutions of P. falciparum SRA could be categorized into 35 unique amino acid variants. Neutrality tests showed that the polymorphism of PfSRA was maintained by positive diversifying selection, which indicated its role as a potential target of protective immune responses and a vaccine candidate. Overall, the ability of the N-terminal of PfSRA antibodies to evoke inhibition of merozoite invasion of erythrocytes and conserved amino acid at low genetic diversity suggest that the N-terminal of PfSRA could be evaluated as a vaccine candidate against P. falciparum infection.","Yang, Bo; Liu, Hong; Xu, Qin-Wen; Sun, Yi-Fan; Xu, Sui; Zhang, Hao; Tang, Jian-Xia; Zhu, Guo-Ding; Liu, Yao-Bao; Cao, Jun; Cheng, Yang",Front Genet,225,1

This study evaluates the incidence of pediatric trauma ED visits and surgeries in Finland during the first and second waves of the pandemic. METHODS: Three large Finnish hospitals, covering one-sixth of the Finnish pediatric population, participated. Data on all ED visits and trauma surgeries between January 2017 and December 2020 were collected from hospital discharge registers. Monthly incidences with 95% CI were calculated per 100 000 person-months by Poisson exact method and compared by incidence rate ratio (IRR). RESULTS: During the lockdown the incidence of head injuries (IRR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.87), sprains (IRR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.46), and fractures (IRR 0.36, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.51) decreased in the 13–17 years age group. In the 4–12 years age group a 55% decrease (IRR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96) in head injuries was observed. During the period of regional restrictions a subtle decrease in head injuries was seen in the 13–17 years age group (IRR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78). During the lockdown in March 2020 the incidence of fractures decreased in the oldest age group (13–17 years) (IRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.85), while a rebound in incidence was seen at the end of the lockdown period in June. CONCLUSION: The nationwide lockdown and the cancellation of sports and other hobbies markedly decreased the injuries among children aged 13–17 years, while the decrease was lower among children aged 4–12 years. Cancellation of sports and hobbies did not affect patients under 4 years of age.","Kuorikoski, Joonas; Kuitunen, Ilari; Uimonen, Mikko; Mattila, Ville M; Ponkilainen, Ville",,225,16

By applying intelligent data analysis techniques, many interesting patterns are identified for the early and onset detection and prevention of several fatal diseases. Diabetes mellitus is an extremely life-threatening disease because it contributes to other lethal diseases, i.e., heart, kidney, and nerve damage. In this paper, a machine learning based approach has been proposed for the classification, early-stage identification, and prediction of diabetes. Furthermore, it also presents an IoT-based hypothetical diabetes monitoring system for a healthy and affected person to monitor his blood glucose (BG) level. For diabetes classification, three different classifiers have been employed, i.e., random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and logistic regression (LR). For predictive analysis, we have employed long short-term memory (LSTM), moving averages (MA), and linear regression (LR). For experimental evaluation, a benchmark PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset is used. During the analysis, it is observed that MLP outperforms other classifiers with 86.08% of accuracy and LSTM improves the significant prediction with 87.26% accuracy of diabetes. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the proposed approach is also performed with existing state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating the adaptability of the proposed approach in many public healthcare applications.","Butt, Umair Muneer; Letchmunan, Sukumar; Ali, Mubashir; Hassan, Fadratul Hafinaz; Baqir, Anees; Sherazi, Hafiz Husnain Raza",J Healthc Eng,225,22

Methods: The study enrolled 70 healthy volunteers aged 22–25years. Each participant performed an ET with and without VR. Time- and frequency-domain heart rate variability (HRV) parameters were analyzed for the first 3min (T1), the last 3min (T2), and the time at which the shorter of the two tests terminated (Tiso). In the time domain, a SD of R–R intervals (SDNN) and a root mean square of successive R–R interval differences (RMSSD) in milliseconds were computed. The following spectral components were considered: low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), total power (TP), and LF/HF ratio. The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04197024). Results: Compared to standard ET, tests in immersive VR lasted significantly longer (694 vs. 591s, p<0.00001) and were associated with lower HR response across the range of corresponding exercise levels, averaging 5–8 beats/min. In the multiple regression analysis, the ET duration was positively determined by male sex, immersion in VR, and negatively determined by HRT1 and RMSSDT1. Conclusion: Exercising in VR is associated with lower HR which allowed subjects to exercise for a longer time before reaching target heart rate (HR). In addition, the increase in exercise duration was found to be related to an adjustment in autonomic nervous activity at a given work rate favoring parasympathetic predominance.","Rutkowski, Sebastian; Szary, Patryk; Sacha, Jerzy; Casaburi, Richard",Front Physiol,225,16

This association likely varies with neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES), but evidence is limited. METHODS We included data from 1355 CRC survivors participating in the population-based Puget Sound Colorectal Cancer Cohort (PSCCC). Survivors reported current annual household income; we measured HRQoL via the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Colorectal (FACT-C) tool. Using neighborhood data summarized within a 1-km radial buffer of Census block group centroids, we constructed a multidimensional nSES index measure. We employed survivors' geocoded residential addresses to append nSES score for Census block group of residence. With linear general estimating equations clustered on survivor location, we evaluated associations of household income with differences in FACT-C mean score, overall and stratified by nSES. We used separate models to explore relationships for wellbeing subscales. RESULTS We found lower household income to be associated with clinically meaningful differences in overall FACT-C scores (<$30K: -13.6, 95% CI: -16.8, -10.4) and subscale wellbeing after a recent CRC diagnosis. Relationships were slightly greater in magnitude for survivors living in lower SES neighborhoods. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that recently diagnosed lower income CRC survivors are likely to report lower HRQoL, and modestly more so in lower SES neighborhoods. IMPACT Findings from this work will aid future investigators' ability to further consider the contexts in which the income of CRC survivors can be leveraged as a means of improving HRQoL.","Robinson, Jamaica Rm; Phipps, Amanda I; Barrington, Wendy E; Hurvitz, Philip M; Sheppard, Lianne; Malen, Rachel C; Newcomb, Polly A","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",225,27

METHODS This retrospective observational study covered a 5-year period from March 2006 to March 2011. It included 45575 adult patients who underwent intubation de novo in the operating room. We considered a tidal volume (VT) greater than 10 mL/kg of ideal body weight (IBW) and/or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) less than 5 cm H2O as not lung protective. We evaluated the use of nonprotective ventilation strategies over time in men and women, by American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and for elective vs emergent surgery. RESULTS Over the duration of the study, there was a significant reduction in the percentage of patients receiving a VT greater than 10 mL/kg IBW (28.5%-16.3%, P < .001), zero PEEP (27.5%-18.2%, P < .001), and VT greater than 10 mL/kg IBW with PEEP less than 5 cm H2O (13.4%-8.0%, P < .001). The odds of receiving nonprotective ventilation were greater for women than for men, in the first year compared with the last year, and for elective compared with emergent surgery. CONCLUSION Although use of nonprotective ventilation decreased over time, an important percentage of patients continue to receive nonprotective ventilation.","Hess, Dean R; Kondili, Dhimiter; Burns, Edward; Bittner, Edward A; Schmidt, Ulrich H",Journal of critical care,225,1

Ultrasound examination of the spleen provides important information to aid the investigation of several conditions and is particularly relevant when an enlarged or irregular spleen is identified during abdominal palpation. CLINICAL CHALLENGES Despite ultrasonography being a commonly used modality, many practitioners are not comfortable performing an ultrasound examination or interpreting the resulting images. Even for the experienced ultrasonographer, differentiating between incidental findings and pathological changes can be challenging. AIM This review, part of an occasional series on feline abdominal ultrasonography, discusses the ultrasound examination of the normal and diseased spleen. Aimed at general practitioners who wish to improve their knowledge of and confidence in feline abdominal ultrasound, this review is accompanied by high-resolution images and videos available online as supplementary material. EQUIPMENT Ultrasound facilities are readily available to most practitioners, although the use of ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool is highly dependent on operator experience.

METHOD Dystonia identification in CP, particularly when comorbid with spasticity, can be difficult. The dystonia diagnostic criterion standard remains subjective visual identification by expert consensus. For this qualitative study, we conducted an inductive thematic analysis of consensus-building discussions between three pediatric movement disorder physicians as they identified the presence or absence of dystonia in gait videos of 40 participants with spastic CP and periventricular leukomalacia. RESULTS Unanimous consensus about the presence or absence of dystonia was achieved for 34 out of 40 videos. Two main themes were present during consensus-building discussions as videos were evaluated for dystonia: (1) unilateral leg or foot adduction that was variable over time, and (2) difficulty in identifying dystonia. Codes contributing to the first theme were more likely to be cited by a discussant when they felt dystonia was present (as opposed to absent) in a video (χ2 test, p=0.004). DISCUSSION These results describe the gait features cited by experts during consensus-building discussion as they identify dystonia in ambulatory people with CP.

We also introduce some operative skills for single-incision laparoscopic surgery. METHODS From May 2009 to July 2011, 15 patients underwent umbilical single-incision laparoscopic liver cyst unroofing. All the clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. Another 15 simple liver cyst patients who received standard laparoscopic liver cyst unroofing at our hospital during the same period--with a similar age, nature of the cyst, and position to the single-incision group--were selected to undergo a case-control study. The operative time, blood loss, recovery time of gastrointestinal function, volume of postoperative drainage, postoperative drainage time, postoperative hospitalization time, and postoperative recurrence rate were compared between the two groups. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the single-incision group and standard group in operative time (58.3 ± 7.43 minutes vs 58.7 ± 6.14 minutes), blood loss (17.0 ± 3.19 mL vs 14.7 ± 1.86 mL), recovery time of gastrointestinal function (2.5 ± 0.22 days vs 2.4 ± 0.22 days), volume of postoperative drainage (408.0 ± 119.5 mL vs 450.0 ± 89.5 mL), postoperative drainage time (2.6 ± 0.55 days vs 3.7 ± 0.59 days), or postoperative hospitalization time (4.8 ± 0.44 days vs 5.2 ± 0.56 days) (P > .05). The postoperative follow-up period was 1 to 24 months. CONCLUSIONS Compared with standard laparoscopic liver cyst unroofing, single-incision laparoscopic liver cyst unroofing shows no significant difference during the overall treatment process. In addition to the advantages of less trauma, more rapid recovery, and shorter hospital stay, single-incision laparoscopic surgery can reach the effect of ""no scar"" and can be safely and effectively carried out.","Wu, Shuodong; Li, Yongnan; Tian, Yu; Li, Min",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,225,14

Like most of the US, barely half of Vermont teens are up-to-date with the vaccination, with comparable deficits in New Hampshire and Maine. The rates for HPV vaccine initiation and completion are as low as 33% in rural New England. Consequently, there is a compelling responsibility to communicate its importance to unvaccinated teenagers before their risk for infection increases. Messaging in rural areas promoting HPV vaccination is compromised by community-based characteristics that include access to appropriate medical care, poor media coverage, parental and peer influence, and skepticism of science and medicine. Current strategies are predominantly passive access to literature and Internet-based information. Evidence indicates that performance-based messaging can clarify the importance of HPV vaccination to teenagers and their parents in rural areas. Increased HPV vaccination will significantly contribute to the prevention of a broadening spectrum of cancers. Reducing rurality-based inequities is a public health priority. Development of a performance-based peer-communication intervention can capture a window of opportunity to provide increasingly effective and sustained HPV protection. An effective approach can be partnering rural schools and regional health teams with a program that is nimble and scalable to respond to public health policies and practices compliant with COVID-19 pandemic-related modifications on physical distancing and interacting in the foreseeable future.","Finley, Christine; Dugan, Matthew J; Carney, Jan Kirk; Davis, Wendy Sue; Delaney, Thomas V; Hart, Victoria C; Holmes, Breena W; Stein, Gary S; Katrick, Robin; Morehouse, Holly; Cole, Bernard; Bradford, Leslie S; Boardman, Maureen B; Considine, Heidi; Kaplan, Nancy C; Plumpton, Merideth; Schadler, Linda; Smith, Jennifer J; McAllister, Kate",Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression,225,11

In this study, we reviewed our experiences with these techniques and compared patients who underwent TEO and TAE using propensity score matching (PSM). METHODS A total of 207 patients underwent local rectal tumor excision between January 2008 and November 2015. To overcome selection bias, we used PSM to achieve a one-to-one TEO: TAE ratio. We included baseline characteristics, age, sex, surgeon, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, tumor location (clockwise direction), involved circumference quadrants, tumor size, and pathology. RESULTS After PSM, 72 patients were included in each group. The tumor distance from the anal verge was higher in the TEO group (8.0 [5-10] vs. TAE: 4.0 [3-5], p < 0.001). Complication rates did not differ between the groups (TEO: 8.3% vs. TAE: 11.1%, p = 0.39). TEO was associated with a shorter hospital stay (3.01 vs. 4.68 days, p = 0.001), higher negative margin rate (95.8 vs. 86.1%, p = 0.039), and non-fragmented specimen rate vs. TAE (98.6 vs. 90.3%, p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS TEO was more beneficial for patients with higher rectal tumors. Regardless of tumor location, involved circumference quadrants, and tumor size, TEO may more effectively achieve negative resection margins and non-fragmented specimens. Consequently, although local excision method according to tumor distance may be important, TEO will become the standard for rectal tumors.","Han, Jeonghee; Noh, Gyoung Tae; Cheong, Chinock; Cho, Min Soo; Hur, Hyuk; Min, Byung Soh; Lee, Kang Young; Kim, Nam Kyu",World journal of surgery,225,31

Five hernia meshes-light weight monofilament polypropylene (Soft Mesh), polyester (Parietex-TET), polylactide composite (TIGR), heavy weight monofilament polypropylene (Marlex), and porcine dermal collagen (Strattice)-were coated with three cell lines: human dermal fibroblasts (HFs), rat kidney fibroblasts (NRKs), and rat MSCs. Cell densities were determined at different time points. Samples also underwent histology and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analyses. It required HFs 3 weeks to cover the entire mesh, while only 2 weeks for NRKs and MSCs to do so. MSCs had no preference for any of the meshes and produced the highest cell densities on Parietex and TIGR. Substrate-preference accounted for the significantly lower fibroblast densities on TIGR than Parietex. Fibroblasts failed to coat Marlex. Strattice, which had the least surface area, generated comparable cell densities to Parietex. Both histology and TEM confirmed cell coating of mesh surface. Various prosthetics can be coated by certain cell strains. Both mesh composition and cell preference dramatically influence the coating process. This methodology provides foundation for novel avenues of modulation of host response to various modern synthetic and biologic meshes.","Gao, Yue; Liu, Li-Jia; Blatnik, Jeffrey A; Krpata, David M; Anderson, James M; Criss, Corry N; Posielski, Natasza; Novitsky, Yuri W","Journal of biomedical materials research.

Though the majority of preterm newborns breathe spontaneously, they are routinely placed on their back after birth. We hypothesised that they would breathe more effectively when placed on their side. OBJECTIVE To determine whether preterm newborns placed on their left side at birth, compared with those placed on their back, have higher preductal oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 5 min of life. DESIGN/METHODS We randomised infants <32 weeks to be placed on their back or on their left side immediately after birth. Respiratory support was given with a T-piece and face mask with initial fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.3. The FiO2 was increased if SpO2 was <70% at 5 min. RESULTS We enrolled 87 infants, 41 randomised to back and 46 to left side. The groups were well matched for demographic variables. Fourteen (6 back and 8 left side) infants did not receive respiratory support in the first 5 min. The mean (SD) SpO2 was not different between the groups (back 72 (23) % versus left side 71 (24) %, p=0.956). We observed no adverse effects of placing infants on their side and found no differences in secondary outcomes between the groups.

Immunosuppression is considered a risk factor for severe COVID-19, but there are only few reports on disease progression in immunocompromised patients. Case Summary We report the case of a 50-year-old patient with acute COVID-19 pneumonia, who had iatrogenic, clinically relevant bone marrow suppression due to accidental overdose with hydroxyurea, and decreased lung capacity due to a left-sided pneumonectomy 6 months earlier. Symptomatic treatment with oxygen supplementation and pulmonary physical therapy was initiated, and hydroxyurea was discontinued. Over 14 days, the patient's blood counts slowly recovered, and his clinical condition gradually improved, such that supplemental oxygen was no longer necessary and he could be discharged. Discussion A gradual increase in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts may be preferable to dampen a potentially detrimental immunological response triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Whether patients with severe COVID-19 benefit from immunosuppressive therapy should be further evaluated.

Despite a range of different techniques post-operative pain remains a major side-effect of this operation. Coblation assisted tonsillectomy is a latest technique of tonsillectomy. This technique is said to be associated with less intra-operative bleeding and less postoperative morbidity. We conducted a study in 100 patients to compare the pain scores between coblation assisted and bipolar diathermy tonsillectomy by FLACC score and Wong Baker scale score. The data so collected was statistically analysed using a t test and p values were calculated. The p value was highly significant (p < 0.001) for both scores in coblation assisted tonsillectomy 6 h postoperatively and on 1st postoperative day (p < 0.05). On 7th post-operative day however there was no significant difference in post-operative pain score using FLACC score in both groups but Wong baker scale scores were still significant.

MERS CoV encodes 2 proteases, 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro). These proteases share in processing MERS CoV polyproteins at different sites to yield 16 nonstructural proteins. In this work, we provide evidence that MERS CoV 3CLpro and PLpro are subject to different genetic and evolutionary influences that shape the protein sequence, codon usage pattern, and codon usage bias. Compositional bias is present in both proteins due to a preference for AT nucleotides. Thymidine (T) was highly preferred at the third position of codons, preferred and overrepresented codons in PLpro, but was replaced by guanosine (G) in 3CLpro. Compositional constraints were important in PLpro but not in 3CLpro. Directed mutation pressure seems to have a strong influence on 3CLpro codon usage, which is more than 30-fold higher than that in PLpro. Translational selection was evident with PLpro but not with 3CLpro. Both proteins are less immunogenic by showing low CpG frequencies. Correspondence analysis reveals the presence of 3 genetic clusters based on codon usage in PLpro and 3CLpro. Every protein had one common cluster and 2 different clusters. As revealed by correspondence analysis, the number of influences on codon usage are restricted in MERS CoV 3CLpro. In contrast, PLpro is controlled by a broader range of compositional, mutational, and other influences. This may be due to the multifunctional protease, deubiquitination, and innate immunity suppressing profiles of PLpro.","Kandeel, Mahmoud; Altaher, Abdallah",Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,225,16

METHODS The anastomosis is created by apposition of the posterior walls of the esophagus and stomach. A linear stapler is applied to create a V-shaped posterior anastomotic wall. The anterior wall is closed in a gentle chevron-like shape with the use of 2 separate linear staplers, resulting in a wide quadrilateral anastomosis. The anastomosis is then wrapped with a greater omentum flap. RESULTS The patient group comprised 48 men and 12 women with a mean age of 67.8 years. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was performed in 43 of these patients. Neither the thoracoscopic or laparoscopic procedure was converted to open surgery in any patient. The median operation time was 474 min (range 680-320 min). The intraoperative blood loss volume was 104.4 mL (range 240-30 mL). There were no anastomosis-related complications above Clavien-Dindo grade II. CONCLUSIONS TRIQ can be performed easily and safely, and good short-term outcome can be expected.","Ishibashi, Yuji; Fukunaga, Tetsu; Mikami, Shinya; Oka, Shinichi; Kanda, Satoshi; Yube, Yukinori; Kohira, Yoshinori; Enomoto, Takeharu; Otsubo, Takehito",Esophagus : official journal of the Japan Esophageal Society,225,12

Through electrophysiology and fluorescence spectroscopy experiments, we show that even in the absence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, the S1 subunit from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to neutral phospholipid membranes leads to their mechanical destabilization and permeabilization. A similar cytotoxic effect of the protein was seen in human lung epithelial cells. A monoclonal antibody generated toward the S1 subunit alleviates to a considerable extent the destabilizing potential of the protein in such model membranes. Finally, we demonstrate the proof-of-concept capability of an α-hemolysin (α-HL) protein nanopore to detect in aqueous buffer and real time the region-binding domain of the S1 subunit from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by monitoring its immunological interaction with a target antibody.

We introduce a new procedure to define the suture points in Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF). SURGICAL TECHNIQUE After dissection of the hiatus and mobilization of the fundus, the circumference of the esophagus c is measured at a point 2-cm cranial from the esophagogastric junction over the 52-Fr bougie. The inner diameter of the fundoplication is calculated based on the esophageal diameter. To create a 2-cm fundoplication in which the greater curvature of the gastric fundus is moved straight toward the cranial side without any twist, we located points a and b, which correspond to the top of the left and right suture positions on fundoplication, respectively. Approximately 2 cm of floppy Nissen is constructed by suturing caudally with intervals of ~1 cm. METHODS A total of 20 patients (3 men, 17 women, mean age, 64.5 years) with gastroesophageal reflux disease and/or hiatal hernia underwent LNF using this procedure. RESULTS LNF was successful in all 20 patients. There were no complications except for mild dysphagia in two patients, which disappeared within 3 weeks. Improvement of the symptom scores for heartburn, regurgitation, and dysphagia was observed in all patients. The evaluation of the fundoplication by the morphologic scores was quite satisfactory. During a median follow-up period of 30 months, 19 patients exhibited no recurrence, and 1 patient had a mild recurrence but was controlled by PPI on demand. CONCLUSIONS Our new procedure is very safe and effective to create a proper Nissen fundoplication. In addition, our preliminary findings highlight the feasibility of precise localization of suture points without the need to measure the circumference of the esophagus and that LNF could be performed without a bougie.","Idani, Hitoshi; Asami, Shinya; Ishikawa, Takashi; Kubo, Shinichiro; Iwamoto, Takayuki; Watanabe, Shinichiro; Kin, Hitoshi",Surgical endoscopy,225,1

In addition, by using truncations at the 5' and 3' ends of S9, a minimal binding region of 35 nt was found to be essential for binding to both the synthetic peptide and to the full-length N protein. Furthermore, by using cell-culture experiments, we found that S9 was capable of packaging non-viral RNA sequence into PRRSV particles and that the 35 nt region was essential for this activity.

This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of TissuCol (fibrin glue), Histoacryl Flex (n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate), and Duraseal (polyethylene glycol) on colorectal anastomotic healing during experimental colitis. METHODS We first performed colectomy 7 days after 10 mg trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis to validate a rat TNBS-colitis-colectomy model. Subsequently, this TNBS-colitis-colectomy model was used in 73 Wistar rats that were stratified into a colitis group (CG, no adhesive), a TissuCol group (TG), a Histoacryl group (HG), and a Duraseal group (DG). Anastomotic sealant was applied with one adhesive after constructing an end-to-end hand-sewn anastomosis. Clinical manifestations, anastomotic bursting pressure, and immunohistochemistry of macrophage type-one (M1) and type-two (M2) was performed on postoperative day (POD)3 or POD7. RESULTS TNBS-caused mucosal and submucosal colon damage and compromised anastomotic healing (i.e., abscess formation and low anastomotic bursting pressure). On POD3, higher severity of abscesses was seen in CG. Average anastomotic bursting pressure was 53.2 ± 35.5 mm Hg in CG, which was significantly lower than HG (134.4 ± 27.5 mm Hg) and DG (95.1 ± 54.3 mm Hg) but not TG (83.4 ± 46.7 mm Hg). Furthermore, a significantly higher M2/M1 index was found in HG. On POD7, abscesses were only seen in CG (6/9) but not in other groups; HG had the lowest severity of adhesion. CONCLUSIONS We describe the first surgical IBD model by performing colectomy in rats with TNBS-induced colitis, which causes intra-abdominal abscess formation and compromises anastomotic healing. Anastomotic sealing with Histoacryl Flex prevents these complications in this model. Alternative activation of macrophages seems to be involved in its influence on anastomotic healing.","Wu, Zhouqiao; Boersema, Geesien S A; Kroese, Leonard F; Taha, Diman; Vennix, Sandra; Bastiaansen-Jenniskens, Yvonne M; Lam, King H; Kleinrensink, Gert-Jan; Jeekel, Johannes; Peppelenbosch, Maikel; Lange, Johan F",Inflammatory bowel diseases,225,24

In clinical practice, optimal management requires careful individualization of dosage in order to achieve an appropriate balance of efficacy and adverse effects. After successful initiation and stabilization of opioid treatment, subsequent changes in regimen may still be required to maintain efficacy with an acceptable adverse effect profile. METHODS This is a qualitative review of the available literature from June 2012 or earlier on opioid rotation for the management of chronic pain in the clinical setting. The PubMed database was searched using various search terms, and additional articles were identified through manual search of the bibliographies of articles identified through the PubMed search. Papers were selected based on relevance to the topic. RESULTS When considering opioid rotation, clinicians must take into account not only the significant differences in potency among opioid drugs but also the considerable interpatient variability in response to opioids. The estimate of relative potency used in calculating an appropriate starting dose when switching from one opioid to another has been codified on equianalgesic dose tables. To reduce the risk of unintentional overdose, a two-step calculation has been proposed, which incorporates an initial reduction (typically 25-50%) in the equianalgesic dose followed by a second evaluation based on the severity of pain at the time of rotation along with other medical or psychosocial factors that might alter the effectiveness and tolerability of the new drug. Given the uncertainty of accurately predicting a patient's response to treatment, each initial exposure to a new opioid should be considered a discrete clinical trial to assess the degree of response. Systematic reviews of opioid rotation have documented the re-establishment of adequate pain control or reduced adverse effects in 50-80% of patients. CONCLUSIONS Although continued research is needed to refine equianalgesic doses further, opioid rotation is an important and necessary practice in patients with chronic cancer or noncancer pain that is refractory to the initially used opioid.","Nalamachu, Srinivas R",Advances in therapy,225,1

METHODS EB patients and controls were recruited during an EB conference (July 2018) and at Tufts Medical Center (June-August 2019). Subjects completed a questionnaire, had best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) tested, and underwent AS-OCT scanning. Stromal and epithelial thickness were measured. Depth, length, and type of the three largest lesions were assessed by a masked examiner using a novel pathology grading system. Multivariate analysis of AS-OCT findings and clinical metrics was performed. RESULTS 62 EB patients and 60 age-matched controls were enrolled. Mean BCVA was 1.8 lines worse in patients (p < 0.001). Vision loss was associated with increased stromal thickness. Discrete lesions were seen in 60.2% of patient eyes, averaging 1.71 ± 1.75 lesions in patients and 0.14 ± 0.42 in controls (p < 0.001). Mean primary lesion depth was 151.88 ± 97.49 μm in patients. Patients showed significant stromal thickening versus controls and lesions were most common in the periphery and inferiorly. Differences in frequency and duration of abrasions and severity of pain were all statistically and clinically significant in patients versus controls (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS AS-OCT can visualize and quantify differences in the corneas of EB patients compared with age-matched controls. Novel findings include quantification of average depth, length, and severity of discrete lesions, and sparing of the superior quadrant from stromal thickening in EB patients. These results support use of AS-OCT and a questionnaire in clinical trials for new EB therapies.","Mehta, Nihaal; Robbins, Calvin C; Noh, Elizabeth; Pramil, Varsha; Duker, Jay S; Waheed, Nadia K; Chen, Vicki M",The ocular surface,225,22

Since then hospitals have reduced inpatient and outpatient workflow and cancelled or suspended all non-emergent and routine surgical procedures. Our objective is to determine whether, during the COVID-19 period, there has been any modification in urological services. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively studied the data from January-May 2020 and 2019 about the variables: number of operations, waiting list, visits in outpatient department, bladder instillations and urological emergencies and admission rates. RESULTS Cancer cases high-risk for stage progression and surgical emergencies, were elected to proceed directly to treatment. The number of the operations was reduced by 43-65% from March-May 2020. Our surgical list had a waiting time of 6-8 weeks before the pandemic and now the waiting time has expanded to 12 weeks. Urological emergencies were reduced about 23-57%. Admission rates were dropped 10-51%. Visits in outpatient clinics were reduced 100-50% and outpatient procedures for elective cases were all deferred. Unfortunately, the hospital did not offer synchronous telehealth appointments. Bladder instillations of BCG or chemotherapeutics were not suspended but start of new cases had a delay of 2-3 weeks. There were no cases of COVID-19 in our department. CONCLUSION All the variables of our urologic practice were affected during the COVID era. The impact of the reduced model of outpatient and inpatient workflow on the health of our patients is unknown. However, longer waiting lists are expected. It is obvious that healthcare providers should adopt a new healthcare model.","Efthimiou, Ioannis",Urology journal,225,16

This study retrospectively evaluated and compared the pre-, intra-, and post-operative clinical characteristics after open and robotic approaches for pancreatic enucleation. METHODS Fifty-six cases of enucleation for benign or borderline tumours of the pancreas treated from March 2010 to July 2015 were identified by a retrospective search. These included 25 patients who underwent an open approach and 31 patients who underwent a robotic approach. The clinical characteristics were extracted and compared. RESULTS The two groups had a similar location and pathology of the tumour. The robotic group had a significantly shorter operation time and significantly less blood loss than the open group. The rates of clinical pancreatic fistula (PF) formation and major complications were similar. The robotic approach could be applied for a tumour on the right side of the pancreas without increasing the incidence of clinical PF or other major complications. The patients with clinical PF had a significantly shorter distance between the lesion and the main pancreatic duct (MPD). CONCLUSION Robotic enucleation appears to be a feasible and safe approach for benign or borderline tumours of the pancreas and was associated with similarly favourable surgical outcomes as the open approach. Identifying and avoiding the MPD is an important step during enucleation.","Jin, Jia-Bin; Qin, Kai; Li, Hua; Wu, Zhi-Chong; Zhan, Qian; Deng, Xia-Xing; Chen, Hao; Shen, Bai-Yong; Peng, Cheng-Hong; Li, Hong-Wei",World journal of surgery,225,12

METHODS Institutional review board approval and informed patient consent were obtained. Fifteen patients (59.8 years ± 9.5) with 18 hepatic malignancies (7 hepatocellular carcinomas, 11 metastases) underwent MR-guided microwave ablation using a 1.5-T MR system. Mean tumour size was 15.4 mm ± 7.7 (7-37 mm). Technical success and ablation zone diameters were assessed by post-ablative MR imaging. Technique effectiveness was assessed after 1 month. Complications were classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Mean follow-up was 5.8 months ± 2.6 (1-10 months). RESULTS Technical success and technique effectiveness were achieved in all lesions. Lesions were treated using 2.5 ± 1.2 applicator positions. Mean energy and ablation duration per tumour were 37.6 kJ ± 21.7 (9-87 kJ) and 24.7 min ± 11.1 (7-49 min), respectively. Coagulation zone short- and long-axis diameters were 31.5 mm ± 10.5 (16-65 mm) and 52.7 mm ± 15.4 (27-94 mm), respectively. Two CTCAE-2-complications occurred (pneumothorax, pleural effusion). Seven patients developed new tumour manifestations in the untreated liver. Local tumour progression was not observed. CONCLUSIONS Microwave ablation is feasible under near real-time MR guidance and provides effective treatment of hepatic malignancies in one session.

It has been described in mice and humans where it is called hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy. Mutated mice show severe movement disorders and die at the age of 3-4 weeks. This study describes the discovery and molecular, clinical, as well as pathological characterization of a new spontaneously occurring mutation in the dystonin gene in C57BL/6N mice. The mutation represents a 40-kb intragenic deletion allele of the dystonin gene on chromosome 1 with exactly defined deletion borders. It was demonstrated by Western blot, mass spectrometry, and immunohistology that mice with a homozygous mutation were entirely devoid of the dystonin protein. Pathomorphological lesions were restricted to the brain stem and spinal cord and consisted of swollen, argyrophilic axons and dilated myelin sheaths in the white matter and, less frequently, total chromatolysis of neurons in the gray matter. Axonal damage was detected by amyloid precursor protein and nonphosphorylated neurofilament immunohistology. Axonopathy in the central nervous system (CNS) represents the hallmark of this disease. Mice with the dystonin mutation also showed suppurative inflammation in the respiratory tract, presumably due to brain stem lesion-associated food aspiration, whereas skeletal muscles showed no pathomorphological changes. This study describes a novel mutation in the dystonin gene in mice leading to axonopathy in the CNS. In further studies, this model may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and may elucidate the complex interactions of dystonin with various other cellular proteins especially in the CNS.","Seehusen, Frauke; Kiel, Kirsten; Jottini, Stefano; Wohlsein, Peter; Habierski, Andre; Seibel, Katharina; Vogel, Tanja; Urlaub, Henning; Kollmar, Martin; Baumgärtner, Wolfgang; Teichmann, Ulrike",Genetics,225,1

The aim of this study was to evaluate the surgical outcomes of totally laparoscopic stomach-partitioning gastrojejunostomy Roux-en-Y reconstruction (TLSPGJ-RY) for GOO. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study enrolled 19 consecutive patients with GOO. Surgical outcomes of LASPGJ-RY (LA group; n=8) and TLSPGJ-RY (TL group; n=11) between January 2004 and 2015 were compared. The patients' background characteristics, operative findings, postoperative complications, and period to starting postoperative chemotherapy were examined. RESULTS Eligible cases included 6 patients with gastric cancer, 4 with pancreatic cancer, 4 with duodenal cancer, 4 with urologic malignancies, and 1 with benign duodenal stenosis. The patients' background characteristics were not significantly different. In surgical outcomes, there were no significant differences in operating time, bleeding, complications (≥Clavien-Dindo grade IIIA), and postoperative hospital stay between the groups.

Although the rate of PJI has not changed significantly over the past decade, the affected patients (hosts) being treated often present with more comorbidities than in the past, and the organisms responsible for these infections are evolving to become more difficult to treat. Fortunately, though, major strides in basic, translational, and clinical research have occurred in recent years that have armed the clinician with an armamentarium of techniques and technologies to better diagnose, prevent, and treat PJI. Advances in diagnostics, including refinements in established biomarkers, the introduction of point of service tests, developments in molecular techniques, and new techniques in advanced imaging will allow us to correctly identify the infecting pathogens and their virulence factors. Utilizing developed risk indexes to stratify and medically optimize our patients, modifying implants to incorporate antimicrobial and anti-biofilm properties, and developing clinically applicable vaccines and biofilm inhibiting enzymes will address our struggles in preventing PJI. Success of our future treatment strategies will hinge on refining the indications and technique of our current surgical procedures as well as the rational use of biofilm disrupting technologies and photodynamic therapy. Finally, the field of metabolomics, though still relatively in its infancy, likely holds the key to a novel diagnostic and treatment approach to infection and a more profound understanding of the pathophysiology of PJI on the human body.","Hansen, Erik N; Zmistowski, Benjamin; Parvizi, Javad",The International journal of artificial organs,225,9

Yet, in order to be effective, a PROM needs to be understandable to respondents. The aim of this cross-sectional analysis was to assess reading level of PROMs validated for use in common eye conditions. Methods and analysis Readability measures determine the level of education a person is expected to have attained to be able to read a passage of text; this was calculated using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, FORCAST and Gunning-Fog tests within readability calculations software package Oleander Readability Studio 2012.1. Forty PROMs, previously validated for use in at least one of age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and/or diabetic retinopathy, were identified for inclusion via a systematic literature search. The American Medical Association (AMA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommend patient materials should not exceed a sixth-grade reading level. Number of PROMs exceeding this level was calculated. Results Median (IQR) readability scores were 7.9 (5.4-10.5), 9.9 (8.9-10.7) and 8.4 (6.9-11.1) for Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, FORCAST and Gunning-Fog test, respectively. Depending on metric used, this meant 61% (95% CI 45% to 76%), 100% (95% CI 91% to 100%) and 80% (95% CI 65% to 91%) exceeded the recommended threshold. Conclusion Most PROMs commonly used in ophthalmology require a higher reading level than that recommended by the AMA and NIH and likely contain questions that are too difficult for many patients to read. Greater care is needed in designing PROMs appropriate for the literacy level of a population.","Taylor, Deanna J; Jones, Lee; Edwards, Laura; Crabb, David P",BMJ open ophthalmology,225,31

Nutritional assessment should identify those patients at high nutritional risk, determined by both disease severity and nutritional status. For such patients if they are unable to maintain volitional intake, enteral access should be attained and enteral nutrition (EN) initiated within 24-48 h of admission. Orogastric or nasogastric feeding is most appropriate when starting EN, switching to post-pyloric or deep jejunal feeding only in those patients who are intolerant of gastric feeds or at high risk for aspiration. Percutaneous access should be used for those patients anticipated to require EN for >4 weeks. Patients receiving EN should be monitored for risk of aspiration, tolerance, and adequacy of feeding (determined by percent of goal calories and protein delivered). Intentional permissive underfeeding (and even trophic feeding) is appropriate temporarily for certain subsets of hospitalized patients. Although a standard polymeric formula should be used routinely in most patients, an immune-modulating formula (with arginine and fish oil) should be reserved for patients who have had major surgery in a surgical ICU setting. Adequacy of nutrition therapy is enhanced by establishing nurse-driven enteral feeding protocols, increasing delivery by volume-based or top-down feeding strategies, minimizing interruptions, and eliminating the practice of gastric residual volumes. Parenteral nutrition should be used in patients at high nutritional risk when EN is not feasible or after the first week of hospitalization if EN is not sufficient. Because of their knowledge base and skill set, the gastroenterologist endoscopist is an asset to the Nutrition Support Team and should participate in providing optimal nutrition therapy to the hospitalized adult patient.","McClave, Stephen A; DiBaise, John K; Mullin, Gerard E; Martindale, Robert G",The American journal of gastroenterology,225,23

The sheer number of pathogens that have appeared, along with their abundance in the environment, demand our attention. For the most part, our innate and adaptive immune systems have successfully protected us from infection; however, in the past 5 decades, through pathogen mutation and ecosystem disruption, a dozen viruses emerged to cause significant neurologic disease. Most of these pathogens have come from sylvatic reservoirs having made the energetically difficult, and fortuitously rare, jump into humans. But the human microbiome is also replete with agents already adapted to the host that need only minor mutations to create neurotropic/toxic agents. While each host/virus symbiosis is unique, this review examines virologic and immunologic principles that govern the pathogenesis of different viral CNS infections that were described in the past 50 years (Influenza, West Nile Virus, Zika, Rift Valley Fever Virus, Hendra/Nipah, Enterovirus-A71/-D68, Human parechovirus, HIV, and SARS-CoV). Knowledge of these pathogens provides us the opportunity to respond and mitigate infection while at the same time prepare for inevitable arrival of unknown agents.","Wiley, Clayton A",Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,225,1

The World Health Organization (WHO) varicella vaccines position paper states that countries where varicella is an important public health burden could consider introducing varicella vaccine (VarV) in the routine childhood immunization program (1). VarV has been available for many years in China but is not included in most routine immunization programs in China. As a result, substantial heterogeneity in vaccination coverage exists across regions. What is added by this report? In Beijing, adding a second dose of VarV for children and increasing coverage reduced the incidence of varicella. Lowering the age of the first dose of VarV to 12 months could further reduce varicella, especially among toddlers. What are the implications for public health practice? Governments should use economic analysis to consider inclusion of VarV into the routine children immunization program as a free vaccine and adopting a 2-dose schedule that starts at 12 months of age.","Zhao, Dan; Suo, Luodan; Lu, Li; Pan, Jingbin; Pang, Xinghuo; Yao, Wei",China CDC weekly,225,1

Much attention has been given to the disparity in maternal morbidity and mortality experienced by Black mothers. The disparity in Black lives lost from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has further highlighted the disparity in health outcomes for Black people. Although COVID-19 is a new disease, the reason for the health disparity is the same as in maternal morbidity and mortality: implicit bias and structural racism. Implicit bias among health care professionals leads to disparities in how health care is delivered. Generations of structural racism perpetuated through racial residential segregation, economic suppression, and health care inequality have normalized the poorer health outcomes for Black Americans. It is easy to dismiss these issues as someone else's problem, because health care professionals often fail to acknowledge the effect of implicit bias in their own practices. We all need to be highly critical of our own practices and look introspectively for implicit bias to find the cure. Health care organizations must invest time and resources into investigating the structural racism that exists within our own walls.","Gillispie-Bell, Veronica",Obstetrics and gynecology,225,1

We have developed an ambulatory medical device that allows vestibular telemetry to record eye movements over a 30-day period to aid the diagnosis of vertigo. We have undertaken proof-of-concept work to identify unique properties of nystagmus that could be used to differentiate between three of the most common causes of vertigo: Ménière's disease, vestibular migraine, and Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. PATIENTS We analyze the nystagmus from patients with a diagnosis of Ménière's disease, vestibular migraine, and Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. INTERVENTIONS Our vestibular telemetry system includes a wearable, ambulatory monitor which continuously records horizontal and vertical eye-movements, as well as three-axis movements of the head. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Horizontal and vertical eye-movement data, and three-axis head positioning data. RESULTS Sixteen participants were enrolled onto the study and three reported experiencing rotatory vertigo during their 30-day trial, confirmed by the presence of nystagmus in their eye-movement traces. Vestibular telemetry revealed distinct differences between the nystagmus produced during an acute Ménière's attack, and attacks of vestibular migraine and Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. Attack frequency, nystagmus duration, whether the nystagmus onset was motion provoked, nystagmus direction, slow phase velocity, and slow phase duration were found to be discriminatory features that could be exploited to allow an automated diagnosis to be made. CONCLUSIONS The data provided by vestibular telemetry can be used to differentiate between different inner-ear causes of dizziness.","Phillips, John S; Newman, Jacob; Cox, Stephen","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",225,31

METHODS We electrically stimulated multiple cortical structures in patients undergoing stereotactic EEG (SEEG) evaluation before epilepsy surgery. Structures investigated were orbitofrontal cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate and subcallosal gyri, insula, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, temporo-polar cortex, antero-mesial fusiform gyrus, and lateral and basal temporal cortices. Chest/abdominal excursions using thoracic/abdominal belts, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation, end tidal and transcutaneous carbon dioxide, and airflow were continuously monitored. RESULTS Nineteen consecutive adult patients (10 female) aged 18-69 years were investigated. Transient central apnea was elicited in 13/19 patients with amygdala, hippocampus head and body, anterior parahippocampal gyrus, and antero-mesial fusiform gyrus. Insula, cingulate, subcallosal, orbitofrontal, lateral, and basal temporal cortices stimulation did not induce apnea. Apnea duration was associated with stimulus duration (p < 0.001) and current intensity (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest a limbic/paralimbic mesial temporal breathing modulation network that includes amygdala, hippocampus, anterior parahippocampal, and antero-mesial fusiform gyri. These structures likely represent anatomical and functional substrates for ICA, a putative sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) breathing biomarker. Damage to such areas is known to occur in high SUDEP risk patients and SUDEP victims, and may underpin the prolonged ICA that is thought to be particularly dangerous. Furthermore, inclusive targeting of apnea-producing structures in SEEG implantations, peri-ictal breathing signal recordings, and stringent analysis of apneic sequences in seizure semiology may enhance accurate identification of symptomatogenic and seizure onset zones for epilepsy surgery.","Lacuey, Nuria; Hampson, Johnson P; Harper, Ronald M; Miller, Jonathan P; Lhatoo, Samden",Neurology,225,16

METHODS A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was undertaken to elicit societal preferences and values. A Bayesian D-efficient and explicit partial profile design was used. The design included 72 choice tasks, split across six blocks, with eight attributes (three overlapping per choice task) and three alternatives. Choice data were analyzed using a panel error component mixed logit model and a latent class model. Preference heterogeneity according to personal socioeconomic, demographic, and attitudinal characteristics was explored using linear and fractional logistic regressions. RESULTS In total, 820 members of the Australian public were recruited. Statistically significant preferences were identified across all eight DCE attributes. We estimated that society on average would be willing to pay AU$5650 more (95% confidence interval [CI]: AU$5500 to $5800) (US$3955 [95% CI: US$3850 to $4060]) for genomic sequencing relative to standard care.

A strategy of in-situ generated coreactant H2O2 and O2 was proposed to enhance luminol ECL intensity. CaO2, possessing a high capacity of self-supplying H2O2 and O2, was encapsulated by ZIF-67, glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase (GOD/HRP-loaded ZIF-67@CaO2). In the presence of glucose, gluconic acid and H2O2 were generated via the catalytic effect of GOD, then gluconic acid can induce the degradation of ZIF-67 leading to the unprotected CaO2 hydrolyzing to produce both O2 and H2O2. Therefore, generated coreactant O2 and H2O2 via the oxidation of glucose and the hydrolysis of CaO2 can effectively enhance luminol ECL behavior. According of luminol ECL reaction occurring on the anode surface of ITO BPE, a sandwich immunosensor was fabricated on the anodic ITO BPE and GOD/HRP-loaded ZIF-67@CaO2 as labels incubated with secondary antibodies. Owing to the cathodic reaction rate influencing the anodic reaction rate, Au nanoparticles were electro-deposited on the cathode surface of ITO BPE, which not only meliorated oxygen reduction, but also further enhanced the ECL intensity of luminol. Under optimal experiments, the ECL immunosensor for detecting CYFRA 21-1 with a wider linear range from 0.0075 to 50 ng mL-1 and a detection limit of 1.89 pg mL-1 (S/N = 3) was obtained.","Li, Xiaojian; Du, Yu; Wang, Huan; Ma, Hongmin; Wu, Dan; Ren, Xiang; Wei, Qin; Xu, Jing-Juan",Analytical chemistry,225,1

To assess costs of video and traditional in-person directly observed therapy (DOT) for tuberculosis (TB) treatment to health departments and patients in New York City, Rhode Island, and San Francisco, California.Methods. We collected health department costs for video DOT (VDOT; live and recorded), and in-person DOT (field- and clinic-based). Time-motion surveys estimated provider time and cost. A separate survey collected patient costs. We used a regression model to estimate cost by DOT type.Results. Between August 2017 and June 2018, 343 DOT sessions were captured from 225 patients; 87 completed a survey. Patient costs were lowest for VDOT live ($1.01) and highest for clinic DOT ($34.53). The societal (health department + patient) costs of VDOT live and recorded ($6.65 and $12.64, respectively) were less than field and clinic DOT ($21.40 and $46.11, respectively). VDOT recorded health department cost was not statistically different from field DOT cost in Rhode Island.Conclusions. Among the 4 different modalities, both types of VDOT were associated with lower societal costs when compared with traditional forms of DOT.Public Health Implications. VDOT was associated with lower costs from the societal perspective and may reduce public health costs when TB incidence is high. (Am J Public Health.

Currently, there is no clear consensus on which is the best suture to use during cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of heat and chemotherapy on sutures' biomechanical properties. METHODS Six different 3.0 absorbable sutures (Biosyn, Dexon II, Maxon, Monocryl, PDS II, and Vicryl Plus) were tested. All suture strands were incubated for a 24-h period in saline, mitomycin-c, and oxaliplatin at 37 and 45°C. Suture loops were then loaded to failure using a servohydraulic testing machine. Data for tensile breaking force (TBF) and elongation rate were collected for all samples. RESULTS Under basal condition, Maxon was the strongest of all sutures with a TBF of 59.6 ± 4.3 N (P < 0.01), and no significant difference in TBF was observed between other sutures. Heat alone had no impact on sutures' biomechanical parameters. Exposition to mitomycin-c at 45°C did not significantly affect sutures' basal tensile properties, with Maxon remaining the strongest suture. When incubated in oxaliplatin at 45°C, the six suture types had a similar TBF. In all experimental conditions, multifilament sutures had a significantly lower elongation rate than monofilament sutures, and no correlations were demonstrated between elongation rate and the TBF of sutures. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that exposition to heated chemotherapy did not significantly affect absorbable sutures biomechanical properties.","Lapointe, Stéphanie; Zhim, Fouad; Sidéris, Lucas; Drolet, Pierre; Célestin-Noël, Syndie; Dubé, Pierre",The Journal of surgical research,225,1

Proteomic analyses can also facilitate the discovery of biomarkers that can be used to diagnose and monitor disease severity, activity and therapeutic response, as well as to identify new targets for drug development. A major challenge for proteomics, however, has been detecting low-abundance proteins in complex biological fluids. This review summarizes how proteomic analyses have advanced lung cell biology and facilitated the identification of new mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in respiratory disorders, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, acute lung injury and sarcoidosis. The impact of nanotechnology and microfluidics, as well as studies of post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions (the interactome), are considered. Furthermore, the application of systems-biology approaches to organize and analyze data regarding the lung proteome, interactome, genome, transcriptome, metabolome, glycome and small RNAome (regulatory RNAs), should facilitate future conceptual advances regarding lung cell biology, disease pathogenesis, biomarker discovery and drug development.","Levine, Stewart J",Expert review of respiratory medicine,225,15

PROCEDURES 2-[(123)I]Iodo-L-phenylalanine ([(123)I]IPA) and [Lys(40)([(111)In]DTPA)]exendin-3 ([(111)In]Ex3) pancreatic uptake and biodistribution were evaluated using SPECT, autoradiography, and an ex vivo biodistribution study in a controlled unilaterally nephrectomized mouse β cell depletion model. Semiquantitative measurement of the imaging results was performed using [(123)I]IPA to delineate the pancreas and [(111)In]Ex3 as a β cell tracer. RESULTS The uptake of [(123)I]IPA was highest in the pancreas. Aside from the kidneys, the uptake of [(111)In]Ex3 was highest in the pancreas and lungs. Autoradiography showed only uptake of [(111)In]Ex3 in insulin-expressing cells. Semiquantitative measurement of [(111)In]Ex3 in the SPECT images based on the delineation of the pancreas with [(123)I]IPA showed a high correlation with the [(111)In]Ex3 uptake data of the pancreas obtained by dissection. A strong positive correlation was observed between the relative insulin positive area and the pancreas-to-blood ratios of [(111)In]Ex3 uptake as determined by counting with a gamma counter and the semiquantitative analysis of the SPECT images. CONCLUSIONS [(123)I]IPA is a promising tracer to delineate pancreatic tissue on SPECT images. It shows a high uptake in the pancreas as compared to other abdominal tissues. This study also demonstrates the feasibility and accuracy to measure the β cell mass in vivo in an animal model of diabetes.","Mathijs, Iris; Xavier, Catarina; Peleman, Cindy; Caveliers, Vicky; Brom, Maarten; Gotthardt, Martin; Herrera, Pedro L; Lahoutte, Tony; Bouwens, Luc",Molecular imaging and biology : MIB : the official publication of the Academy of Molecular Imaging,225,23

The VEEV nsP2 protease is a member of MEROPS Clan CN and characteristically contains a papain-like protease linked to an S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent RNA methyltransferase (SAM MTase) domain. The protease contains an alternative active site motif, (475)NVCWAK(480), which differs from papain's (CGS(25)CWAFS), and the enzyme lacks a transition state-stabilizing residue homologous to Gln-19 in papain. To understand the roles of conserved residues in catalysis, we determined the structure of the free enzyme and the first structure of an inhibitor-bound alphaviral protease. The peptide-like E64d inhibitor was found to bind beneath a β-hairpin at the interface of the SAM MTase and protease domains. His-546 adopted a conformation that differed from that found in the free enzyme; one or both of the conformers may assist in leaving group departure of either the amine or Cys thiolate during the catalytic cycle. Interestingly, E64c (200 μM), the carboxylic acid form of the E64d ester, did not inhibit the nsP2 protease. To identify key residues involved in substrate binding, a number of mutants were analyzed. Mutation of the motif residue, N475A, led to a 24-fold reduction in kcat/Km, and the conformation of this residue did not change after inhibition. N475 forms a hydrogen bond with R662 in the SAM MTase domain, and the R662A and R662K mutations both led to 16-fold decreases in kcat/Km. N475 forms the base of the P1 binding site and likely orients the substrate for nucleophilic attack or plays a role in product release. An Asn homologous to N475 is similarly found in coronaviral papain-like proteases (PLpro) of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus. Mutation of another motif residue, K480A, led to a 9-fold decrease in kcat and kcat/Km. K480 likely enhances the nucleophilicity of the Cys. Consistent with our substrate-bound models, the SAM MTase domain K706A mutation increased Km 4.5-fold to 500 μM. Within the β-hairpin, the N545A mutation slightly but not significantly increased kcat and Km. The structures and identified active site residues may facilitate the discovery of protease inhibitors with antiviral activity.","Hu, Xin; Compton, Jaimee R; Leary, Dagmar H; Olson, Mark A; Lee, Michael S; Cheung, Jonah; Ye, Wenjuan; Ferrer, Mark; Southall, Noel; Jadhav, Ajit; Morazzani, Elaine M; Glass, Pamela J; Marugan, Juan; Legler, Patricia M",Biochemistry,225,1

This study compared procedural outcomes and costs between SILC and LC. METHODS A retrospective review of patients undergoing SILC over an 8-month period was performed. A cohort of LC patients from the same surgeons over the preceding 8 months was used as historic controls. Demographics, comorbidities, diagnosis, operative data, pain control in the recovery room, complications, length of hospital stay, and cost were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Of the 285 patients, 177 underwent LC and 108 underwent SILC. The mean age was 49.7 years for the LC patients and 48.2 years for the SILC patients (p = 0.44). Two of the LC patients underwent conversion to open surgery. None of SILC patients were converted to open procedure, although nine had additional ports placed. After multivariate adjustment, SILC was associated with a 15% longer operative time (p = 0.053) and a 66% shorter hospital stay (p = 006) than LC. Biliary dyskinesia and biliary colic were independently associated with shorter operative times and a reduced hospital stay. No significant differences were noted in pain score, narcotics used in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), 30-day complication rates (1.7 vs 1.9%; p = 1), hospital charges, or cost between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision LC is safe, significantly reduces the hospital stay, and is an acceptable alternative to traditional LC. Although further study is warranted, initial results indicate that SILC may offer the most benefit for outpatient procedures.","Joseph, Sigi; Moore, B Todd; Sorensen, G Brent; Earley, John W; Tang, Fengming; Jones, Phil; Brown, Kimberly M",Surgical endoscopy,225,6

Patients with underlying medical conditions are at higher risks of complications and mortality. The diagnosis of COVID-19 on the basis of the imaging features may be more challenging in patients with preexisting cardiothoracic conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and malignancies with cardiothoracic involvement.

Regional blood flow changes characteristic of neurovascular coupling provide an important marker of neuronal activation. However, changes in systemic physiological parameters such as blood pressure and concentration of CO2 can also affect regional blood flow and may confound haemodynamics-based neuroimaging. Measurements with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) may additionally be confounded by blood flow and oxygenation changes in extracerebral tissue layers. Here we investigate these confounds using an extended version of an existing computational model of cerebral physiology, 'BrainSignals'. Our results show that confounding from systemic physiological factors is able to produce misleading haemodynamic responses in both positive and negative directions. By applying the model to data from previous fNIRS studies, we demonstrate that such potentially deceptive responses can indeed occur in at least some experimental scenarios. It is therefore important to record the major potential confounders in the course of fNIRS experiments.

In this study, airborne ARGs loaded on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and source tracking based on the airflow trajectories were performed by the potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) model. The results show that the absolute abundance of ARG subtypes were generally twice times higher in the winter season than that in the summer season, which could be attributable to winter haze events with high particulate matter concentrations in Handan. Exogenous input from serious haze events and local release of ARGs loaded on PM2.5 of air masses may cause higher levels of ARGs in the winter.

Percutaneous computed tomography-guided RFA of the bone metastasis to temperatures >60 degrees C was performed. Endpoints were the toxicity and pain effects of RFA before and at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months after RFA. RESULTS Fifty-five patients completed RFA. Grade 3 toxicities occurred in 3 of 55 (5%) patients. RFA reduced pain at 1 and 3 months for all pain assessment measures. The average increase in pain relief from pre-RFA to 1-month follow-up is 26.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.7-34.9; P < .0001), and the increase from pre-RFA to 3-month follow-up is 16.38 (95% CI, 3.4-29.4; P = .02).

In this review, we discuss the effects of soy isoflavones on the overall gut function and inflammation and assess how these effects might be implicated in the treatment of several gut-related diseases. RECENT FINDINGS Soy isoflavones influence several key aspects of gastrointestinal health: improve basal intestinal secretion, alleviate inflammation, limit intestinal morphological damage, and improve epithelial barrier function in several clinically relevant murine models of gastrointestinal diseases. Dietary supplementation with isoflavones proves to be a key means to improve the overall gut function and health.

However, some future emerging pathogens are existing microbes that will be discovered to cause disease. Some will arise from existing ones by either predictable evolutionary and adaptation changes or by unpredictable changes involving a variety of biotic and abiotic mechanisms. Many, and perhaps most, emerging waterborne human pathogens will be zoonotic agents or come from other non-human reservoirs. The emergence of some waterborne pathogens will be related to antibiotic use, resulting in emerging antibiotic-resistant waterborne pathogens. Reliably predicting pathogen emergence and human health effects based on VFARs or other properties of microbes and their hosts is not possible at this time. This is because of (1) the diversity of microbes and their virulence and pathogenicity properties, (2) their ability to change unpredictably, (3) their intimate and diverse interrelationships with a myriad of hosts and dynamic natural and anthropogenic environments and (4) the subtle variations in the immune status of individuals. The best available approach to predicting waterborne pathogen emergence is through vigilant use of microbial, infectious disease and epidemiological surveillance. Understanding the microbial metagenome of the human body can also lead to a better understanding of how we define and characterize pathogens, commensals and opportunists.","Sobsey, Mark D; Pillai, Suresh D",Journal of water and health,225,24

OBJECTIVE To study the seropositivity of HCWs as a high-risk group compared to general population. METHODS 72 samples were obtained from HCWs working in Masih Daneshvari hospital as one of the main COVID-19 admission centers in Tehran, during April 4 to 6, 2020. Also we collected 2021 blood samples from general population. The SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM, and IgG antibodies in the collected serum specimens were measured by commercial ELISA kits. RESULTS Based on the clinical manifestations, 25.0%, 47.2%, and 27.8% of HCWs were categorized as symptomatic with typical symptoms, symptomatic with atypical symptoms, and asymptomatic, respectively. Symptomatic individuals with typical and atypical symptoms were 63.2% and 36.8% positive in RT-PCR test, respectively. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in 15.3% and 27.8% of HCWs samples, respectively. Antibody testing in the general population indicated that SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG were found in (162/2021) 8%, and (290/2021) 14.4%, respectively. The frequency of positive cases of IgM and IgG were significantly increased in HCWs compared to general population (p= 0.028 for IgM and p= 0.002 for IgG). CONCLUSION The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in HCWs was higher than general population indicating a higher viral transmission via close exposure with COVID-19 patients.","Mortezagholi, Sahar; Rostamzadeh, Davood; Alinejad, Maedeh; Younesi, Vahid; Tabarsi, Payam; Shabani, Mahdi",Iranian journal of immunology : IJI,225,20

Patients with vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy are typically offered laser or intravitreal injections which often require more than one treatment cycle. However, treatment is not always initiated, or it is not completed, resulting in poor visual outcomes. Interventions aimed at improving the uptake or completion of treatment for diabetic retinopathy can potentially help prevent or delay visual loss in people with diabetes. METHODS We will search MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health and Cochrane Register of Studies for studies reporting interventions to improve the uptake of treatment for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and/or diabetic macular oedema (DMO), compared with usual care, in adults with diabetes. The review will include studies published in the last 20 years in the English language. We will include any study design that measured any of the following outcomes in relation to treatment uptake and completion for DR and/or DMO: (1) proportion of patients initiating treatment for DR and/or DMO among those to whom it is recommended, (2) proportion of patients completing treatment for DR and/or DMO among those to whom it is recommended, (3) proportion of patients completing treatment for DR and/or DMO among those initiating treatment and (4) number and proportion of DR and/or DMO rounds of treatment completed per patient, as dictated by the treatment protocol. For included studies, we will also report any measures of cost-effectiveness when available. Two reviewers will screen search results independently. Risk of bias assessment will be done by two reviewers, and data extraction will be done by one reviewer with verification of 10% of the papers by a second reviewer. The results will be synthesised narratively. DISCUSSION This rapid review aims to identify and synthesise the peer-reviewed literature on the effectiveness of interventions to increase uptake and completion of treatment for DR and/or DMO in LMICs. The rapid review methodology was chosen in order to rapidly synthesise the available evidence to support programme implementers and policy-makers in designing evidence-based health programmes and public health policy and inform the allocation of resources.

The current study assessed the associations of age, gender and their interaction with loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic, controlling for other sociodemographic variables. A pooled sample of 3,012 English-speaking Canadian adults aged 18+ years completed a web-based survey in one of three waves between May 8 and June 23, 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the associations of loneliness with age and gender controlling for marital status, household income, education, living alone, employment situation, and survey wave. A likelihood ratio test assessed the model with interaction between age and gender included. Approximately 8.4% of the sample reported feeling lonely 5+ days in the past week. The regression model with main effects found greater odds of loneliness among women than men (AOR = 1.76, 95%CI = 1.32, 2.34) and among all age groups younger than 60 years compared to those aged 60+ years (p = 0.002). In the final regression model, a significant interaction effect between age and gender on loneliness was found. The interaction showed that women had greater odds of loneliness than men among those aged 18-29 years (AOR = 3.53, 95%CI = 1.69, 7.37) and 60+ years (AOR = 2.62, 95%CI = 1.33, 5.17). Special consideration of loneliness among younger and older adult women is needed in service planning. Given inconsistencies with pre-pandemic studies, detailed data collected during the current crisis is essential to inform proactive resource allocation to prevent and treat mental health consequences of the pandemic.","Wickens, Christine M; McDonald, André J; Elton-Marshall, Tara; Wells, Samantha; Nigatu, Yeshambel T; Jankowicz, Damian; Hamilton, Hayley A",Journal of psychiatric research,225,16

The whole process of vaccination was monitored by clinical pharmacists, and the occurrence, types, severity of adverse reactions were recorded in detail. Through the investigation and analysis on the safety of COVID-19 vaccination of the 2305 people, the important role and value of clinical pharmacists in the vaccination process was elaborated. Common adverse reactions included local pain, dizziness and fatigue, with the incidence rates of 2.09%, 0.67% and 0.49%, respectively. Others such as headache, nausea, skin itching, cough, palpitation, dry mouth, hand anesthesia, local induration, muscle soreness, local rash, and chill had incidence rates of less than 0.30%. Three cases of serious adverse events that occurred in this vaccination returned to normal after treatment, with no subsequent discomfort. Clinical pharmacists played an important role in the safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccination. The safety of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine is good.

For this production, light is the main limiting factor. We investigated the potential of intercanopy lighting (ICL) using light emitting diodes (LEDs) to improve blackberry fruit yield in a crop with a spring and an autumn production cycle. During the spring production cycle three light treatments were applied: only natural light (no ICL), 93 or 185 μmol m-2 s-1 ICL In summer the lateral shoots were cut back and 93 μmol m-2 s-1 ICL was applied to all plants after cutting back, investigating a possible carryover effect of supplemental light in spring on autumn production. Fresh fruit yield in spring increased by 79 and 122% with 93 and 185 μmol m-2 s-1 ICL, respectively, compared to no ICL. This represents 3.6 and 2.8% increase in harvestable product for every additional 1% of light. A yield component analysis and leaf photosynthesis measurements were conducted. Maximum photosynthetic capacity (A max) for leaves at 185 μmol m-2 s-1 ICL was about 50% higher, and LAI was 41% higher compared to no ICL. ICL increased the number of fruiting laterals per cane, and this explained 75% of the increase in yield. ICL at 185 μmol m-2 s-1 resulted in a higher yield compared to no ICL, primarily as a result of higher total dry matter production. Furthermore, a higher fraction of dry matter partitioned to the fruits (0.59 compared to 0.52) contributed to yield increase, whereas fruit dry matter content and fruit quality (sugar and acid content) was not affected by ICL. Averaged over the three light treatments autumn yield was 47% lower than spring yield. Autumn yield was 10% higher for plants at ICL 93 μmol m-2 s-1 in spring and 36% higher for plants at 185 μmol m-2 s-1 in spring compared to no ICL in spring. This increased autumn yield was caused by more fruiting laterals (less necrotic buds). It is concluded that management practices in spring can have a carryover effect on the autumn production. This is the first scientific paper on the potential for applying LED ICL in blackberries. Further research should focus on optimal intensity of ICL, positioning of supplementary lighting and economic feasibility.","Rivas, Anabel; Liu, Kang; Heuvelink, Ep",Frontiers in plant science,225,24

BACKGROUND DJB has been shown to improve oral glucose tolerance in normal rats and a genetic diabetic rat model. Because intestinal D-glucose absorption is mediated by SGLT1 localized in the brush border membrane of small intestinal enterocytes, it is unclear whether function of SGLT1 is altered by DJB and whether this contributes to the improvement of glycemic control. METHODS A high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin administration were used to induce a type 2 diabetes in male Lewis rats. The diabetic animals underwent DJB or sham surgery. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was used to evaluate glucose control 3 weeks after surgery. SGLT1-mediated glucose transport was assessed using everted rings of different small intestinal segments. SGLT1 mRNA expression was determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS DJB improved the OGTT significantly (P < 0.001) compared with sham-operated rats while body weight was not different among the surgical groups. DJB induced a 50% reduction of SGLT1-mediated glucose uptake into enterocytes of duodenum and jejunum (P < 0.001). The concentration of D-glucose in the blood following glucose gavage increased more slowly after DJB versus sham. CONCLUSIONS The data indicate that DJB surgery decreases glucose absorption in the small intestine by downregulation of SGLT1-mediated glucose uptake. We suggest that the downregulation of SGLT1 contributes to the body-weight independent improvement of diabetes type 2.","Jurowich, Christian Ferdinand; Rikkala, Prashanth Reddy; Thalheimer, Andreas; Wichelmann, Christian; Seyfried, Florian; Sander, Victor; Kreissl, Michael; Germer, Christoph-Thomas; Koepsell, Hermann; Otto, Christoph",Annals of surgery,225,16

The lack of efficient countermeasure strategies, the potential for dispersion into new regions, and the pathogenesis in humans and livestock make RVFV a serious public health concern. The receptors, cellular factors, and entry pathways used by RVFV and other members of the family Bunyaviridae remain largely uncharacterized. Here we provide evidence that RVFV strain MP-12 uses dynamin-dependent caveola-mediated endocytosis for cell entry. Caveolae are lipid raft domains composed of caveolin (the main structural component), cholesterol, and sphingolipids. Caveola-mediated endocytosis is responsible for the uptake of a wide variety of host ligands, as well as bacteria, bacterial toxins, and a number of viruses. To determine the cellular entry mechanism of RVFV, we used small-molecule inhibitors, RNA interference (RNAi), and dominant negative (DN) protein expression to inhibit the major mammalian cell endocytic pathways. Inhibitors and RNAi specific for macropinocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis had no effect on RVFV infection. In contrast, inhibitors of caveola-mediated endocytosis, and RNAi targeted to caveolin-1 and dynamin, drastically reduced RVFV infection in multiple cell lines. Expression of DN caveolin-1 also reduced RVFV infection significantly, while expression of DN EPS15, a protein required for the assembly of clathrin-coated pits, and DN PAK-1, an obligate mediator of macropinocytosis, had no significant impact on RVFV infection. These results together suggest that the primary mechanism of RVFV MP-12 uptake is dynamin-dependent, caveolin-1-mediated endocytosis.","Harmon, Brooke; Schudel, Benjamin R; Maar, Dianna; Kozina, Carol; Ikegami, Tetsuro; Tseng, Chien-Te Kent; Negrete, Oscar A",Journal of virology,225,1

METHODS 'Targeted gene walking PCR' was used to amplify the unknown gene of DEV clone-03 strain adjacent to known sequences in the UL region. Open reading frames (ORFs) were determined by Gene Runner and an online transcriptional element search engine. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by DNAStar based on the deduced amino acid sequences. RESULTS A fragment of 13,947 bp, containing 5 ORFs (designated ICP4, ORF1, ORF2, LORF2 and LORF3, respectively), was amplified from the DEV clone-03 strain genome. In addition, a tandem repeat region of alpha-type-like sequences was detected between ICP4 and LORF2. Phylogenetic analysis of ICP4 indicated that DEV ICP4 should be clustered into Varicellovirus. DEV ORF1 and ORF2 were unique among herpesviruses. Additionally, the existence and characteristics of LORF2 and LORF3 indicated a close relationship with Mardivirus members.

While the correct use of i.v. fluids can be lifesaving, recent literature demonstrates that fluid therapy is not without risks. Indeed, the use of certain types and volumes of fluid can increase the risk of harm, and even death, in some patient groups. Data from a recent audit show us that the inappropriate use of fluids may occur in up to 20% of patients receiving fluid therapy. The delegates of the 12th Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) Conference sought to obtain consensus on the use of i.v. fluids with the aim of producing guidance for their use. In this article, we review a recently proposed model for fluid therapy in severe sepsis and propose a framework by which it could be adopted for use in most situations where fluid management is required. Considering the dose-effect relationship and side-effects of fluids, fluid therapy should be regarded similar to other drug therapy with specific indications and tailored recommendations for the type and dose of fluid. By emphasizing the necessity to individualize fluid therapy, we hope to reduce the risk to our patients and improve their outcome.","Hoste, E A; Maitland, K; Brudney, C S; Mehta, R; Vincent, J-L; Yates, D; Kellum, J A; Mythen, M G; Shaw, A D",British journal of anaesthesia,225,1

However, commercially available sEMG electrodes are not optimized for the head and neck area, have rigid form, and are mostly available in large medical centers. We developed an ultrathin, soft, and flexible sEMG patch, specifically designed to conform to the submental anatomy and which will be ultimately incorporated into a telehealth system. To validate this first-generation sEMG patch, we compared its safety, efficiency, and signal quality in monitoring submental muscle activity with that of widely used conventional sEMG electrodes. Method A randomized crossover design was used to compare the experimental sEMG patch with conventional (snap-on) sEMG electrodes. Participants completed the same experimental protocol with both electrodes in counterbalanced order. Swallow trials included five trials of 5- and 10-ml water. Comparisons were made on (a) signal-related factors: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), baseline amplitude, normalized mean amplitude, and sEMG burst duration and (b) safety/preclinical factors: safety/adverse effects, efficiency of electrode placement, and satisfaction/comfort. Noninferiority and equivalence tests were used to examine signal-related factors. Paired t tests and descriptive statistics were used to examine safety/preclinical factors. Results Forty healthy adults participated (24 women, M age = 67.5 years). Signal-related factors: SNR of the experimental patch was not inferior to the SNR of the conventional electrodes (p < .0056). Similarly, baseline amplitude obtained with the experimental patch was not inferior to that obtained with conventional electrodes (p < .0001). Finally, normalized amplitude values were equivalent across swallows (5 ml: p < .025; 10 ml: p < .0012), and sEMG burst duration was also equivalent (5 ml: p < .0001; 10 ml: p < .0001). Safety/preclinical factors: The experimental patch resulted in fewer mild adverse effects. Participant satisfaction was higher with the experimental patch (p = .0476, d = 0.226). Conclusions Our new wearable sEMG patch is equivalent with widely used conventional sEMG electrodes in terms of technical performance. In addition, our patch is safe, and healthy older adults are satisfied with it. With lessons learned from the current COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to develop optimal swallowing telerehabilitation devices are more urgent than ever. Upon further validation, this new technology has the potential to improve rehabilitation and telerehabilitation efforts for patients with dysphagia.

A new strain of coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]) was identified and caused the first pandemic of the 21st century. The virus was officially detected in our country on March 11, 2020, and the number of cases increased rapidly; the virus was isolated in 670 patients within 10 days. The rapid increase in the number of patients has required our physicians to learn to protect both the public and themselves when treating patients with this highly infectious disease. The group most affected by the outbreak and with the highest mortality rate is elderly patients with known cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is necessary for cardiology specialists to take an active role in combating the epidemic. The aim of this article is to make a brief assessment of current information regarding the management of cardiovascular patients affected by COVID-19 and to provide practical suggestions to cardiology specialists about problems and questions they have frequently encountered.","Aktoz, Meryem; Altay, Hakan; Aslanger, Emre; Atalar, Enver; Aytekin, Vedat; Baykan, Ahmet Oytun; Barçın, Cem; Barış, Nezihi; Boyacı, Asiye Ayça; Çavuşoğlu, Yüksel; Çelik, Ahmet; Çinier, Göksel; Değertekin, Muzaffer; Ergönül, Önder; Ertürk, Mehmet; Erol, M Kemal; Görenek, Bülent; Gürsoy, Mustafa Ozan; Hünük, Burak; Kahveci, Gökhan; Karabay, Can Yücel; Karaca, Ilgın; Kayıkçıoğlu, Meral; Keskin, Muhammed; Kılıç, Teoman; Kırma, Cevat; Kocabaş, Umut; Küçükoğlu, Serdar; Mutlu, Bülent; Nalbantgil, Sanem; Okuyan, Ertuğrul; Okyay, Kaan; Kaptan Özen, Deniz; Özgül, Sami; Özpelit, Ebru; Pirat, Bahar; Sert, Sena; Sinan, Ümit Yaşar; Şener, Yusuf Ziya; Tatlı, Ersan; Tekkeşin, Ahmet İlker; Tutar, Eralp; Ural, Dilek; Yıldırımtürk, Özlem",Turk Kardiyoloji Dernegi arsivi : Turk Kardiyoloji Derneginin yayin organidir,225,16

Testing public health messaging about COVID-19.,20.304667,1.6549836,2021-05-13,"BACKGROUND During a pandemic, it is paramount to understand volume changes in Level I trauma so that with appropriate planning and reallocation of resources, these facilities can maintain and even improve life-saving capabilities. Evaluating nonaccidental and accidental trauma can highlight potential areas of improvement in societal behavior and hospital preparedness. These critical questions were proposed to better understand how healthcare leaders might adjust surgeon and team coverage of trauma services as well as prepare from a system standpoint what resources will be needed during a pandemic or similar crisis to maintain services. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES (1) How did the total observed number of trauma activations, defined as patients who meet mechanism of injury requirements which trigger the notification and aggregation of the trauma team upon entering the emergency department, change during a pandemic and stay-at-home order? (2) How did the proportion of major mechanisms of traumatic injury change during this time period? (3) How did the proportion and absolute numbers of accidental versus nonaccidental traumatic injury in children and adults change during this time period? METHODS This was a retrospective study of trauma activations at a Level I trauma center in New Orleans, LA, USA, using trauma registry data of all patients presenting to the trauma center from 2017 to 2020. The number of trauma activations during a government mandated coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) stay-at-home order (from March 20, 2020 to May 14, 2020) was compared with the expected number of activations for the same time period from 2017 to 2019, called ""predicted period"". The expected number (predicted period) was assumed based on the linear trend of trauma activations seen in the prior 3 years (2017 to 2019) for the same date range (March 20, 2020 to May 14, 2020). To define the total number of traumatic injuries, account for proportion changes, and evaluate fluctuation in accidental verses nonaccidental trauma, variables including type of traumatic injury (blunt, penetrating, and thermal), and mechanism of injury (gunshot wound, fall, knife wound, motor vehicle collision, assault, burns) were collected for each patient. RESULTS There were fewer total trauma activations during the stay-at-home period than during the predicted period (372 versus 532 [95% CI 77 to 122]; p = 0.016). The proportion of penetrating trauma among total activations was greater during the stay-at-home period than during the predicted period (35% [129 of 372] versus 26% [141 of 532]; p = 0.01), while the proportion of blunt trauma was lower during the stay-at-home period than during the predicted period (63 % [236 of 372] versus 71% [376 of 532]; p = 0.02). The proportion of gunshot wounds in relation to total activations was greater during the stay-at-home period than expected (26% [97 of 372] versus 18% [96 of 532]; p = 0.004). There were fewer motor vehicle collisions in relation to total activations during the stay-at-home period than expected (42% [156 of 372] versus 49% [263 of 532]; p = 0.03). Among total trauma activations, the stay-at-home period had a lower proportion of accidental injuries than the predicted period (55% [203 of 372] versus 61% [326 of 532]; p = 0.05), and there was a greater proportion of nonaccidental injuries than the predicted period (37% [137 of 372] versus 27% [143 of 532]; p < 0.001). In adults, the stay-at-home period had a greater proportion of nonaccidental injuries than the predicted period (38% [123 of 328] versus 26% [123 of 466]; p < 0.001). There was no difference between the stay-at-home period and predicted period in nonaccidental and accidental injuries among children. CONCLUSIONS Data from the trauma registry at our region's only Level I trauma center indicate that a stay-at-home order during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a 70% reduction in the number of traumatic injuries, and the types of injuries shifted from more accidental blunt trauma to more nonaccidental penetrating trauma. Non-accidental trauma, including gunshot wounds, increased during this period, which suggest community awareness, crisis de-escalation strategies, and programs need to be created to address violence in the community. Understanding these changes allows for adjustments in staffing schedules. Surgeons and trauma teams could allow for longer shifts between changeover, decreasing viral exposure because the volume of work would be lower. Understanding the shift in injury could also lead to a change in specialists covering call. With the often limited availability of orthopaedic trauma-trained surgeons who can perform life-saving pelvis and acetabular surgery, this data may be used to mitigate exposure of these surgeons during pandemic situations.

Using Google's data on community mobility, I employ an event-study design to compare the effects of movement restrictions on physical mobility in the U.S. and Europe. I find that compared to Europe, the U.S. has higher levels of mobility related to visits to groceries and pharmacies and lower levels of the residential presence relative to baseline values, and the differences are not only statistically significant but also of large magnitudes. Such differences in post-restriction mobility are still significant between Europe and the U.S.' early epicenters of COVID-19. The main results of this paper are robust to changes in samples and specifications. These findings suggest that movement restrictions appear to be less effective in the U.S., which have useful implications for health policy evaluation, pandemic forecasting, and economic recovery.","Xu, Dafeng",Economics and human biology,225,27

METHODS Patients undergoing RRH for cervical cancer (n = 109) were prospectively collected between July 2007 and April 2014 in the 5 Belgian centers performing RRH for cervical cancer. RESULTS The median age of the patients was 46 years (range, 31-80 years). Histological types included squamous cell carcinoma in 61 patients, adenocarcinoma in 22 patients, adenosquamous in 8 patients, endometrioid carcinoma in 2 patients, and other types (n = 16). The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage distribution was IA (n = 9), stage IB1 (n = 71), stage IB2 (n = 4), stage II (n = 24), and unknown (n = 1). Twenty-four patients received adjuvant therapy, 17 patients underwent radiochemotherapy, and 7 underwent adjuvant radiation. Eighteen patients relapsed, and 5 died of disease. The median follow-up was 27.5 months (range, 3-82 months). The 2- and 5-year overall survivals were 96% and 89%, respectively. The 2- and 5-year disease-free survivals (DFSs) were 88% and 72%, respectively. The 2-year DFS per stage was 100% for IA, 88% for IB1, 100% for IB2, and 83% for II. The 5-year DFS per stage was 100% for stage IA and 75% for IB1. The complications were as expected for radical hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS This series confirms the feasibility and safety of RRH not only in cervical cancer stage IA to IB1, but also after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage IB2 to IIB.","Segaert, An; Traen, Koen; Van Trappen, Philippe; Peeters, Frederik; Leunen, Karin; Goffin, Frédéric; Vergote, Ignace",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,225,8

The challenges of these practices include maintaining sensitivity of the nipple-areola complex (NAC), achieving upper-pole fullness, and preserving an adequate blood supply for patients with massive breast ptosis. OBJECTIVES The authors describe their experience with power-assisted liposuction mammaplasty (PALM), a novel technique for breast reduction. METHODS One hundred fifty consecutive women (300 breasts) who underwent PALM were evaluated in a prospective study. Minimizing skin undermining and glandular resection ensured maximal blood supply to the breast. A lateral pedicle was created to preserve NAC sensitivity. The transposed gland was contained within a large pocket made in the upper-inner quadrant. Glandular suspension sutures from the dermis to the chest wall stabilized the breast and recreated the inframammary fold. RESULTS The mean distance from the nipple to the sternal notch was 36 cm, the mean NAC elevation was 16 cm, the mean lipoaspirate volume per breast was 650 cc, and the mean glandular resection mass per breast was 240 g. Complications included wound infection (6 of 300 breasts, 2%), wound dehiscence (3 breasts, 1%), and seroma (9 breasts, 3%). Partial areolar necrosis occurred in 2 of 150 patients (1.3%), and 9 patients (6%) underwent revisional surgery. CONCLUSIONS PALM is a safe and reliable option for breast reduction and is indicated for patients with massive breast ptosis.

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between hyponatremia and bronchiolitis severity in children hospitalized in the ICU for bronchiolitis. METHODS We conducted a 16-center, prospective cohort study of hospitalized children aged <2 years with bronchiolitis during the winters of 2007 through 2010. Patients were classified into 2 groups (normonatremic [135-145 mEq/L] and hyponatremic [<135 mEq/L]) based on the first-measured serum sodium concentration on the day of hospitalization. Outcomes were use of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay (LOS). To examine the association of sodium status with outcomes, we fit logistic and linear regression models with propensity score adjustment. RESULTS Of 231 children hospitalized in the ICU for bronchiolitis, 193 (84%) were categorized into the normonatremic group and 38 (16%) into the hyponatremic group. Compared with children with normonatremia, those with hyponatremia had higher risks of mechanical ventilation use (40% vs 58%; P = .04) and longer ICU LOS (median, 3 vs 6 days; P = .007). Likewise, in the adjusted analyses, children with hyponatremia had significantly higher risks of mechanical ventilation use (odds ratio, 2.14 [95% confidence interval, 1.03-4.48; P = .04) and longer ICU LOS (β-coefficient, 2.21 days [95% confidence interval, 0.68-3.73; P = .005]). CONCLUSIONS In this prospective, multicenter study of children hospitalized for bronchiolitis, hyponatremia on the day of hospitalization was associated with a higher severity of disease. Our data support hyponatremia as a prognostic factor that might improve the ability of clinicians to predict the disease course of children with severe bronchiolitis.","Hasegawa, Kohei; Stevenson, Michelle D; Mansbach, Jonathan M; Schroeder, Alan R; Sullivan, Ashley F; Espinola, Janice A; Piedra, Pedro A; Camargo, Carlos A",Hospital pediatrics,225,26

MATERIALS AND METHODS Interventional neuroradiology case records were evaluated retrospectively to identify patients treated with an SFD in combination with Cat5. Demographic data, technical success, location of the catheter tip, aneurysm occlusion rate, and procedure-related morbidity and mortality were noted. RESULTS The analysis yielded 24 patients with 25 aneurysms with a mean age of 52.3±19.7 years. The mean aneurysm diameter was 15.7±8.8 mm. Twenty-one were anterior circulation (seven supraclinoid, one middle cerebral, one anterior choroidal and 12 petrocavernous) and four were posterior circulation (three basilar tip, one posterior inferior cerebellar) aneurysms. Only two of these aneurysms were re-treatments for recurrences. For SFD deployment, the distal tip of Cat5 was placed intradurally and at, or distal to, M1 segment in 88% and 48% of patients, respectively. Aneurysms were bypassed with Cat5 in 80% of the procedures. In one patient, flow diversion was abandoned totally due to arterial tortuosity. With the exclusion of this patient, the technical success rate was 91.7%. There was no permanent procedure-related morbidity or mortality. Of the 22 aneurysms treated successfully with the Surpass device, 20 had imaging follow-up at 6.3±3.8 months and 95% were totally occluded. CONCLUSION The Cat5 catheter, which was manufactured for the navigation of large-bore stent-like devices, is a useful adjunct to the Surpass device and allowed us to deploy the device safely.","Topcuoglu, Osman Melih; Arat, Anil; Peker, Ahmet; Sarikaya, Basar",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,225,33

However, since legal precautions cannot be implemented continuously, hand washing, mask usage and obeying social distance rules are important in combating the pandemic. Complying with these rules is mostly individual decisions. The behavior of individuals has a prominent place in the course of the pandemic. In this study, we aimed to develop a scale which could measure compliance with outbreak measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was conducted in two stages after evaluation of the content validity of the item pool formed by the research group by experts. For construct validity, the scale sub-dimensions were determined in 250 people between the ages of 18-70 years at the first stage and the definitive version of the 20-item scale was constructed. In the second stage, exploratory factor analysis was repeated in a group of 484 people, and confirmatory factor analysis was performed. Cronbach?s alpha coefficients, Spearman-Brown coefficients, test-retest methods were used to determine reliability. RESULTS The variance explanation of the scale consisting of 20 items and two sub-dimensions in the explanatory factor analysis is 63.434% (n = 484).

PATIENTS AND METHODS This retrospective analysis focused on prolactin-producing adenomas without hyperprolactinemia, which were initially treated by surgery as nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. Among 942 patients with histologically confirmed pituitary adenoma, 114 (12.1 %) patients, consisting of 68 men and 46 women, who had prolactin-producing adenomas without hyperprolactinemia were identified between April 2005 and March 2019. RESULTS Of the 114 patients identified, 13 (11.4 %) had prolactin mono-expressions, 18 (15.8 %) had pit-1 lineage hormonal expressions, and 83 (72.8 %) had paradoxical immunoexpression out of the pituitary differentiation lineage, including prolactin. During the follow-up period, 19 patients suffered tumor progression, and 14 required salvage treatment. Of the 19 patients, 11 underwent gamma knife radiosurgery, and none of them experienced further tumor progression. Cabergoline was administered of them to six patients, and one achieved tumor shrinkage. However, the remaining five patients who were treated with cabergoline suffered further tumor progression and required another salvage treatment. Among the patients in the prolactin mono-expression group, one experienced tumor regrowth and underwent gamma knife radiosurgery. In the pit-1 lineage group, two patients experienced tumor regrowth. One had further tumor progression after treatment with cabergoline and underwent gamma knife radiosurgery. Among the patients in the paradoxical immunoexpression group, 16 suffered tumor progression. Four patients underwent further surgery, seven patients were treated with gamma knife radiosurgery, and one patient received fractionated irradiation. None of the eight patients who were treated with gamma knife radiosurgery and fractionated irradiation showed further tumor progression. Four patients in this group were treated with cabergoline, but they all suffered further tumor progression and underwent additional salvage treatments. CONCLUSIONS Out of the pituitary differentiation lineage, paradoxical hormonal expression occurred in three-quarters of the patients identified. Further surgery or gamma knife radiosurgery should be given priority in times of tumor progression because most patients were resistant to dopamine agonists.","Ogawa, Yoshikazu; Tominaga, Teiji",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,225,24

Mipomersen is a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits the synthesis of apolipoprotein B-100, an essential component of low density lipoprotein (LDL), and thus decreases the production of LDL. We aimed to determine the effect of mipomersen in patients with FH. Methods: We searched Ovid Medline, Ovid EMBASE, WHO ICTRP search portal, ISI database, the reference lists of relevant articles, and also Google Scholar to retrieve articles. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients with FH receiving mipomersen as an add-on and a parallel group receiving a placebo or no intervention were selected. Results: Five studies with more than 500 patients were included. All had low risk of bias. Pooling data showed that mipomersen probably reduces LDL compared with placebo [mean difference: -24.79, 95% CI (-30.15, -19.43)] but with a moderate level of certainty. There was a high level of evidence for injection site reactions [RR = 2.56, CI (1.47-4.44)] and a low level for increased serum alanine transaminase (ALT) > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) [RR = 5.19, CI (1.01-26.69)]. Conclusion: A moderate level of evidence in decreasing serum LDL indicates that we are uncertain if this drug provides benefit in any outcome important to patients. Although a low level of evidence for an increase in serum ALT leaves uncertainty about this adverse effect, injection site reactions in 10% or more of patients can be an important concern.","Astaneh, Behrooz; Makhdami, Nima; Astaneh, Vala; Guyatt, Gordon",Journal of cardiovascular development and disease,225,0

We have previously demonstrated that SNT-1, a mouse synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) homologue, functions as the fast Ca2+ sensor in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we report a new Ca2+ sensor, SNT-3, which triggers delayed Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release. snt-1;snt-3 double mutants abolish evoked synaptic transmission, demonstrating that C. elegans NMJs use a dual Ca2+ sensor system. SNT-3 possesses canonical aspartate residues in both C2 domains, but lacks an N-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain. Biochemical evidence demonstrates that SNT-3 binds both Ca2+ and the plasma membrane. Functional analysis shows that SNT-3 is activated when SNT-1 function is impaired, triggering SV release that is loosely coupled to Ca2+ entry. Compared with SNT-1, which is tethered to SVs, SNT-3 is not associated with SV. Eliminating the SV tethering of SNT-1 by removing the TM domain or the whole N terminus rescues fast release kinetics, demonstrating that cytoplasmic SNT-1 is still functional and triggers fast neurotransmitter release, but also exhibits decreased evoked amplitude and release probability. These results suggest that the fast and slow properties of SV release are determined by the intrinsically different C2 domains in SNT-1 and SNT-3, rather than their N-termini-mediated membrane tethering. Our findings therefore reveal a novel dual Ca2+ sensor system in C. elegans and provide significant insights into Ca2+-regulated exocytosis.","Li, Lei; Liu, Haowen; Krout, Mia; Richmond, Janet E; Wang, Yu; Bai, Jihong; Weeratunga, Saroja; Collins, Brett M; Ventimiglia, Donovan; Yu, Yi; Xia, Jingyao; Tang, Jing; Liu, Jie; Hu, Zhitao",The Journal of cell biology,225,1

This requires the support of evidence-based medicine to take into account possible interactions between antidepressants, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, and coronavirus infection treatments. METHODS Three databases were consulted: (a) Lexicomp Drug Interactions, (b) Micromedex Solutions Drugs Interactions, (c)Liverpool Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies. The CredibleMeds QTDrugs List was also queried. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, anakinra, and dexamethasone - drugs used for SARS-CoV-2 - were analyzed, and consensus recommendations are made. RESULTS The potential interactions of agomelatine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, milnacipran, and vortioxetine with COVID-19 treatments shall be considered less risky. Antidepressant interactions with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and azithromycin enhance the risk of QT prolongation, and ECG monitoring is advised for most antidepressants. Antidepressants with lopinavir/ritonavir involve multiple CYP enzyme interactions (except with milnacipran). Gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, pregabalin, topiramate, and zonisamide are safe treatment options that have no significant interactions with COVID-19 treatments. Lithium is contraindicated with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and azithromycin. Precaution should be taken in using valproic acid with lopinavir-ritonavir. The use of benzodiazepines does not present a risk of drug interaction with COVID-19 treatments, except lopinavir/ritonavir. CONCLUSIONS Clinicians prescribing antidepressants, mood stabilizers/anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepines, should be aware of the probable risk of drug-drug interaction with COVID-19 medications and may benefit from heeding these recommendations for use to ensure patient safety.","Plasencia-García, Beatriz Oda; Rico-Rangel, María Isabel; Rodríguez-Menéndez, Gonzalo; Rubio-García, Ana; Torelló-Iserte, Jaime; Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto",Pharmacopsychiatry,225,16

The severity of clinical signs depends on the virus strain. Two genetically different PEDV strains are known to infect pigs, the PEDV S-InDel strains which circulate on all continents and the highly virulent PEDV S-non-InDel strains found in Asia and in America. We have previously demonstrated the presence of PEDV RNA in semen from boars experimentally infected with an S-non-InDel PEDV strain. If naturally infected boars may shed PEDV in semen, this would have important consequences for the breeding sector. Thus we sought to determine whether PEDV has been circulating in populations of breeding boars from French artificial insemination (AI) centers. The current study reports on a serological survey conducted on one hundred and twenty boars from six AI centers, representing 18.6% of the total population of breeding boars in French AI centers in 2015. All of them were found negative for PEDV antibodies, showing no evidence of PEDV circulation in French AI centers at that time.","Gallien, S; Catinot, V; Pozzi, N; Berri, M; Authié, E; Rose, N; Grasland, B",Porcine health management,225,31

There are also serious infectious diseases classically considered zoonotic, such as influenza, rabies, bubonic plague, brucellosis, and leptospirosis. More recently, it has been recognized that wildlife constitutes a particularly important source of novel zoonoses. With all this microbial movement, surveillance is considered the first line of public health defense. The zoonotic origin of many human and livestock infections argues strongly for the synergistic value of a One Health approach, which provides the capability to identify pathogens crossing into new species and could provide earlier warning of potential epidemics. This article discusses public health surveillance and major recent surveillance initiatives and reviews progress toward implementing a One Health surveillance framework. Networks discussed include global intergovernmental organizations and recent combined efforts of these organizations; Web-based nongovernmental systems (e.g., ProMED, the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases); and networks of bilateral or multilateral government programs (e.g., the CDC's Global Disease Detection [GDD] platform; the U.S. Department of Defense's Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System [GEIS]; regional and subregional networks; and the U.S. Agency for International Development's Emerging Pandemic Threats [EPT] program and its surveillance component, PREDICT).

Major determinants of metabolic phenotypes are the changes in signalling pathways associated with oncogenic activation together with cues from the tumor microenvironment. Therein, depleted oxygen and nutrient levels elicit metabolic stress, requiring cancer cells to engage adaptive mechanisms. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) act as regulatory elements within metabolic pathways and their widespread dysregulation in cancer contributes to altered metabolic phenotypes. Indeed, ncRNAs are the regulatory accomplices of many prominent effectors of metabolic reprogramming including c-MYC and HIFs that are activated by metabolic stress. By example, this review illustrates the range of ncRNAs mechanisms impacting these effectors throughout their DNA-RNA-protein lifecycle along with presenting the mechanistic roles of ncRNAs in adaptive responses to glucose, glutamine and lipid deprivation. We also discuss the facultative activation of metabolic enzymes by ncRNAs, a phenomenon which may reflect a broad but currently invisible level of metabolic regulation. Finally, the translational challenges associated with ncRNA discoveries are discussed, emphasizing the gaps in knowledge together with importance of understanding the molecular basis of ncRNA regulatory mechanisms.","Liu, Xiaoying; Feng, Shanshan; Zhang, Xu Dong; Li, Jinming; Zhang, Kaiguang; Wu, Mian; Thorne, Rick F",Cancer letters,225,0

STUDY DESIGN Preterm infants born at <32 weeks of gestation were randomized to immediate cord clamping, umbilical cord milking (cord stripped 3 times), or delayed cord clamping for 60 seconds with bedside resuscitation. All infants underwent electroencephalogram (EEG) and cerebral near infrared spectroscopy for the first 72 hours after birth. Neonatal primary outcome measures were quantitative measures of the EEG (17 features) and near infrared spectroscopy over 1-hour time frames at 6 and 12 hours of life. RESULTS Forty-five infants were recruited during the study period. Twelve infants (27%) were randomized to immediate cord clamping, 19 (42%) to umbilical cord milking, and 14 (31%) to delayed cord clamping with bedside resuscitation. There were no significant differences between groups for measures of EEG activity or cerebral near infrared spectroscopy.

But disentangling the mechanism underlying RNA chaperoning is challenging, mostly due to inherent disorder of the chaperones and the transient nature of their interactions with RNA. In particular, it is unclear how specific the interactions are and what role is played by amino acid charge and polarity patterns. Here, we address these questions in the RNA chaperone StpA. By adapting direct coupling analysis (DCA) to treat in tandem sequences written in two alphabets, nucleotides and amino acids, we could analyze StpA-RNA interactions and show consistency with a previously proposed two-pronged mechanism: StpA disrupts specific positions in the group I intron while globally and loosely binding to the entire structure. Moreover, the interactions are strongly associated with the charge pattern: negatively charged regions in the destabilizing StpA N-terminal affect a few specific positions in the RNA, located in stems and in the pseudoknot. In contrast, positive regions in the C-terminal contain strongly coupled amino acids that promote non-specific or weakly-specific binding to the RNA. The present study opens new avenues to examine the functions of disordered proteins and to design disruptive proteins based on their charge patterns.","Reinharz, Vladimir; Tlusty, Tsvi",RNA,225,5

MATERIALS AND METHODS An exploratory retrospective analysis was performed at two comprehensive stroke centres to assess changes in stroke care between the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (weeks 10-18 of 2020) and the same period in 2019. RESULTS Of the 419 included stroke patients, 186 (44.4%) presented during the COVID-19 period. There was an increase in in-hospital delays for reperfusion therapies, and a significant decrease in the number of acute cerebrovascular accident admissions, predominantly related to a low number of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) admissions to hospital (-20.17%). The delays were shorter in the mothership paradigm than in the drip-and-ship paradigm of acute stroke care (onset-to-groin 293 vs. 232 min, p = 0.03). No differences in stroke aetiology, large-vessel occlusion frequency, or severe stroke admissions in the COVID-19 period were observed. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS COVID-19's emergence was correlated with a significant reduction in admissions to stroke departments, particularly for TIAs, and a prolonged delay in reperfusion stroke treatment, especially in the drip-and-ship paradigm.

Indeed, many neuropathic screening tools are primarily based on subjective descriptors to determine the presence of neuropathic pain. There is a need to systematically review and analyse the existing evidence to determine the validity of such descriptors in this cohort.Methods: Ten databases were systematically searched. The review adhered to PRISMA and CRD guidelines and included a risk of bias assessment using QUADAS-2. Studies were included if they contained symptom descriptors from a group of NLBP patients +/-leg pain. Studies had to include a reference test to identity neuropathic pain from other pain mechanisms.Results: Eight studies of 3,099 NLBP patients were included. Allodynia and numbness were found to discriminate between NLBP and nociceptive LBP in 4 studies. Autonomic dysfunction, (changes in the colour or appearance of the skin), was also found to discriminate between the groups in 2 studies. Dysesthesia identified NLBP in 5/7 respectively. Results from studies were equivocal regarding pain described as hot/burning cold and paroxysmal pain in people with NLBP.Conclusion: Subjectively reported allodynia and numbness would suggest a neuropathic pain mechanism in LBP. Dysesthesia would raise the suspicion of NLBP. More research is needed to determine if descriptors suggesting autonomic dysfunction can identify NLBP.

The success of these nonpharmaceutical strategies will depend on not only the effectiveness of isolation measures but also the epidemiological characteristics of the infection. However, there is currently no systematic framework to assess the relationship between different containment strategies and the natural history and epidemiological dynamics of the pathogen. Here, we compare the effectiveness of quarantine and symptom monitoring, implemented via contact tracing, in controlling epidemics using an agent-based branching model. We examine the relationship between epidemic containment and the disease dynamics of symptoms and infectiousness for seven case-study diseases with diverse natural histories, including Ebola, influenza A, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We show that the comparative effectiveness of symptom monitoring and quarantine depends critically on the natural history of the infectious disease, its inherent transmissibility, and the intervention feasibility in the particular healthcare setting. The benefit of quarantine over symptom monitoring is generally maximized for fast-course diseases, but we show the conditions under which symptom monitoring alone can control certain outbreaks. This quantitative framework can guide policymakers on how best to use nonpharmaceutical interventions and prioritize research during an outbreak of an emerging pathogen.","Peak, Corey M; Childs, Lauren M; Grad, Yonatan H; Buckee, Caroline O",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,225,24

We explored the impact of insurance status, education, and income on survival and receipt of chemoradiation therapy. METHODS We included patients with ASCC from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database from 2004 to 2016. Socioeconomic variables included insurance status, level of education, income, and unemployment rate. Cox proportional hazards and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine predictors of survival and receipt of chemoradiation. RESULTS We included a total of 10,868 cases of ASCC. The median age was 55, 10.4 % were black, and 65.4 % were female. Overall, 74.1 % of patients received combination chemoradiation. In multivariate analysis, poorer survival was found for Medicaid (HR 1.52, 95 % CI 1.34-1.74) and uninsured (HR 1.68, 95 % CI 1.35-2.10) patients, and for communities with the lowest rates of high school education (HR 1.17, 95 % CI 1.02-1.38), lowest income (HR 1.29, 95 % CI 1.08-1.54), and highest unemployment (HR 1.21, 95 % CI 1.03-1.40). Patients were less likely to receive combination treatment if they were black (OR 0.76, 95 % CI 0.55-0.92), had Medicaid insurance (OR 0.54, 95 % CI 0.33-0.88) or lower education (OR 0.59, 95 % CI 0.46-0.76).

The primary aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of a cardiac output and alveolar ventilation matched Gas Man model and to compare its predictive performance with the standard pharmacokinetic model using patient data.Therefore, patient data from volatile anesthesia were successively compared to simulated administration of desflurane and sevoflurane for the standard and a parameter-matched simulation model with modified alveolar ventilation and cardiac output. We calculated the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between measured and calculated induction, maintenance and elimination and the expiratory decrement times during emergence and recovery for the standard and the parameter-matched model.During induction, RMSDs for the standard Gas Man simulation model were higher than for the parameter-matched Gas Man simulation model [induction (desflurane), standard: 1.8 (0.4) % Atm, parameter-matched: 0.9 (0.5) % Atm., P = .001; induction (sevoflurane), standard: 1.2 (0.9) % Atm, parameter-matched: 0.4 (0.4) % Atm, P = .029]. During elimination, RMSDs for the standard Gas Man simulation model were higher than for the parameter-matched Gas Man simulation model [elimination (desflurane), standard: 0.7 (0.6) % Atm, parameter-matched: 0.2 (0.2) % Atm, P = .001; elimination (sevoflurane), standard: 0.7 (0.5) % Atm, parameter-matched: 0.2 (0.2) % Atm, P = .008]. The RMSDs during the maintenance of anesthesia and the expiratory decrement times during emergence and recovery showed no significant differences between the patient and simulated data for both simulation models.Gas Man simulation software predicts expiratory concentrations of desflurane and sevoflurane in humans with good accuracy, especially when compared to models for intravenous anesthetics. Enhancing the standard model by ventilation and hemodynamic input variables increases the predictive performance of the simulation model. In most patients and clinical scenarios, the predictive performance of the standard Gas Man simulation model will be high enough to estimate pharmacokinetics of desflurane and sevoflurane with appropriate accuracy.","Weber, Jonas; Mißbach, Claudia; Schmidt, Johannes; Wenzel, Christin; Schumann, Stefan; Philip, James H; Wirth, Steffen",Medicine,225,17

We aimed to clarify the epidemiology, laboratory examinations, imaging findings, and treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Hebei province, China. METHODS In this retrospective study, the demographic, laboratory and imaging, and treatment data of patients with severe COVID-19 treated in 13 designated hospitals in Hebei were collected and analyzed. RESULTS A total of 319 severe COVID-19 patients were treated at the 13 designated hospitals between 22 January, 2020 and 25 March, 2020. Eventually, 51 critically ill (31 severe cases and 20 critically severe cases) patients were included in the analysis. The patients had an average age of 58.9±13.7 years, and 27 (52.9%) were men. Twenty-one (41.2%) were familial cluster, and 33 (64.7%) had chronic illnesses. The patients in critically severe group had longer duration from symptom to confirmation, more severe infections, more severe lung injury, and a lower percentage of lymphocytes. All 51 patients received antiviral drugs, 47 (92.2%) received antibacterial agents, 49 (96.1%) received traditional Chinese drugs, and 46 (90.2%) received methylprednisolone. The critically severe patients received more fluid and more diuretic treatment; 14 (70.0%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 13 (65.0%) developed extrapulmonary complications. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients who had underlying diseases and longer confirmation times were more likely to progress to critically severe COVID-19. These patients also presented with a higher risk of respiratory depression, circulatory collapse, extrapulmonary complications, and infection.","Chen, Yuhong; Zhang, Kun; Zhu, Guijun; Liu, Lixia; Yan, Xixin; Cai, Zhigang; Zhang, Zhongheng; Zhi, Haijun; Hu, Zhenjie",Annals of palliative medicine,225,1

Exploration of a Strategy to Mitigate Rural Health Disparities,20.464804,1.5326304,2020-08-26,"The ability of cells to take and change shape is a fundamental feature underlying development, wound repair, and tissue maintenance. Central to this process is physical and signaling interactions between the three cytoskeletal polymeric networks: F-actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments (IFs). Vimentin is an IF protein that is essential to the mechanical resilience of cells and regulates cross-talk amongst the cytoskeleton, but its role in how cells sense and respond to the surrounding extracellular matrix is largely unclear. To investigate vimentin’s role in substrate sensing, we designed polyacrylamide hydrogels that mimic the elastic and viscoelastic nature of in vivo tissues. Using wild-type and vimentin-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we show that vimentin enhances cell spreading on viscoelastic substrates, even though it has little effect in the limit of purely elastic substrates. Our results provide compelling evidence that the vimentin cytoskeletal network is a physical modulator of how cells sense and respond to mechanical properties of their extracellular environment.","Swoger, Maxx; Gupta, Sarthak; Charrier, Elisabeth E.; Bates, Michael; Hehnly, Heidi; Patteson, Alison E.",bioRxiv,225,8

169037,169037,169037,A Public Health Perspective in the Times of COVID-19,20.366585,1.7993177,2020,"Aim The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, has infected more than 10 million people and caused 500K deaths worldwide. In Europe, over 2 million confirmed cases have been reported, while nearly 200K people have died from the disease. Despite strict containment measures in Spain and Italy after the first reported COVID-19 patient, these two countries have remained in the top five European nations with the highest mortality rate for over two months. We hypothesised that a genetic mechanism could partially explain the poor survival outcome observed in these two countries. Methods An extensive literature search to identify human candidate genes linked to SARS-CoV infection, host immune evasion and disease aggressiveness was carried out. Pathway analysis (IPA) was performed to select the most significantly associated canonical signalling pathways with the genes of interest. The genetic variants’ at these genes with ±1Mb flanking region was extracted (GRCh37/hg19 built). Over 80 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analysed in genome-wide data of 2,504 individuals (1000 genomes, phase III, https://www.internationalgenome.org/). Principal component (PC) analysis was performed, ancestry by the whole genome was inferred and subsets of the regions of interest were extracted (PLINK v1.9b, http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/). PC1 to PC20 values from five European ancestries, including the Spanish and Italian populations, were used for PC analysis. Gene function predictions were run with our genes of interest as a query to the GeneMANIA Cytoscape plugin (https://genemania.org/). Results A total of 437 candidate genes associated with SARS were identified, including 21 correlated with COVID-19 aggressiveness. The two most significant pathways associated with all 437 genes (Caveolar-mediated Endocytosis and MSP-RON Signalling) did not show any segregation at the population level. However, the most significant canonical pathway associated with genes linked to COVID-19 aggressiveness, the Hepatic Fibrosis and Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation, showed population-specific segregation. Both the Spanish and Italian populations clustered together from the rest of Europe. This was also observed for the Finnish population but in the opposite direction. These results suggest some of the severe COVID-19 cases reported in Spain and Italy could be partially explained by a pre-existing liver condition (especially liver cancer) and/or may lead to further COVID-19 related liver complications.","Moya, Leire; Farashi, Samaneh; Suravajhala, Prashanth N; Janaththani, Panchadsaram; Batra, Jyotsna",bioRxiv,225,1

With children staying more at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, more educational tools and valid educational programs are warranted to improve parental knowledge and awareness about children's safety. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of child safety campaigns on parents' knowledge and attitude towards preventable childhood injuries. Methods: This was a pre-post experimental study, in which the pre-designed assessments were used as an evaluation tool before and after attending a Child Safety Campaign. The Pre - Post assessment question included questions to evaluate the socio-demographic status, followed by knowledge questions in line with the current child safety campaign. The outcomes of interest were assessed before and after attending the campaign's stations. Results: Three hundred and eight parents volunteered to participate in this study. Their knowledge score improved from 36.2 (SD 17.7) to 79.3 (SD 15.6) after attending the Child Safety Campaign (t-value= 34.6, p<0.001). Both, perceptions on the preventability of accidents and the parents' perceived usefulness of educational campaigns showed improvements, with (t-value =6.3, p<0.001) and (t-value= 3.097, p<0.001), respectively. Conclusion: The educational child safety campaign for caregivers in Saudi Arabia resulted in a significant increase in the overall knowledge and attitudes towards children's safety. As children are currently staying at home more, additional educational tools and programs are warranted to promote childhood safe practices among parents and caregivers.","Temsah, M.-H.; Aljamaan, F.; Alhaboob, A.; Almosned, B.; Alsebail, R.; Temsah, R.; Senjab, A.; Alarfaj, A.; Aljudi, T.; Esmaeil, S.

For researchers, we recommend updating the transition definition, reconsidering the measurement of salient transition-related variables, and utilizing study designs/methods that best facilitate this work. For practitioners, we recommend considering the dynamic nature of transition within holistic athlete care, building momentum on mental health destigmatization achieved during the pandemic, athlete transition education, and clinician advocacy for transition-related resources for athletes.

The COVID-19 infection which emerged in December 2019, is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. Infection with this virus can lead to severe respiratory illness, however, myocarditis has also been reported. The purpose of this study is to identify the clinical features of myocarditis in COVID-19 patients. METHODS. A systematic review was conducted to investigate characteristics of myocarditis in patients infected with COVID-19 using the search term “Coronavirus” or “COVID” and “myocarditis,” “heart,” or “retrospective.” Case reports and retrospective studies were gathered by searching Medline/Pubmed, Google Scholar, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases. 11 articles were selected for review. RESULTS. COVID-19 myocarditis affected patients over the age of 50 and incidences among both genders were equally reported. Patients presented with dyspnea, cough, fever with hypotension and chest pain. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis with increased C-reactive protein, while arterial blood gas analysis demonstrated respiratory acidosis. All cardiac markers were elevated. Radiographic imaging of the chest showed bilateral ground glass opacities or bilateral infiltrates, while cardiac magnetic resonance imaging produced late gadolinium enhancements. Electrocardiography demonstrated ST-segment elevation or inverted T waves, while echocardiography revealed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with cardiomegaly or increased wall thickness. Management with corticosteroids was favored in most cases, followed by antiviral medication. The majority of studies reported either recovery or no further clinical deterioration. CONCLUSION. Current available data on COVID-19 myocarditis is limited. Further research is needed to advance our understanding of COVID-19 myocarditis.","Kariyanna, Pramod Theetha; Sutarjono, Bayu; Grewal, Ekjot; Singh, Kamal Preet; Aurora, Lyudmila; Smith, Leanna; Chandrakumar, Harshith Priyan; Jayarangaiah, Apoorva; Goldman, Sarah A.; Salifu, Moro O.; McFarlane, Isabel M.",Am J Med Case Rep,225,5

We have evaluated the clinical and radiographic outcomes of 72 patients with probable SARS (median age 37 years, 30 M), who received ribavirin and different steroid regimens in two regional hospitals. Chest radiographs were scored according to the percentage of lung field involved. Seventeen patients initially received pulse steroid (PS) (methylprednisolone > or =500 mg/day) and 55 patients initially received nonpulse steroid (NPS) (methylprednisolone <500 mg/day) therapy. The cumulative steroid dosage; intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality rates; and hematologic and biochemical parameters were similar in both groups after 21 days. However, patients in the PS group had less oxygen requirement, better radiographic outcome, and less likelihood of requiring rescue PS therapy than their counterparts. There was no significant difference between the two groups in hemolytic anemia, severe secondary infections, or hematemesis, but patients in the PS group had less hyperglycaemia. Initial use of pulse methylprednisolone therapy appears to be a more efficacious and an equally safe steroid regimen when compared with regimens with lower dosage and should be considered as the preferred steroid regimen in the treatment of SARS, pending data from future randomized controlled trials.","Ho, James C; Ooi, Gaik C; Mok, Thomas Y; Chan, Johnny W; Hung, Ivan; Lam, Bing; Wong, Poon C; Li, Patrick C; Ho, Pak L; Lam, Wah K; Ng, Chun K; Ip, Mary S; Lai, Kar N; Chan-Yeung, Moira; Tsang, Kenneth W",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,225,11

Patients with COVID-19 who presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) shared distinct characteristics. For example, the patients were older, and had higher levels of inflammatory indicators [i.e., levels of CRP, SAA, procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin-6; CRP-to-PCT ratio; SAA-to-CRP ratio; and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)], higher inflammatory cell counts (i.e., white blood cell count and neutrophil count), and lower lymphocyte counts compared with patients without ARDS. Patients without ARDS still exhibited mild illness and had elevated SAA levels but not CRP levels. In patients with elevated SAA and CRP levels, the NLR was statistically associated with disease severity. According to the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the combined predictive probability of CRP and SAA levels, along with white blood cell count, showed the highest area under the curve (AUC; 0.878), and was able to distinguish between patients with and without ARDS. The cut-off level for SAA to predict the severity of COVID-19 was 92.900, with a sensitivity of 95.8%, a specificity of 53.7%, and an AUC of 0.712. For patients with elevated levels of SAA but not CRP, a mild condition was predicted. For patients with elevated levels of both SAA and CRP, and a high NLR, a severe infection was predicted, requiring medical attention. Therefore, CRP and SAA levels demonstrate a prognostic value for predicting the severity of COVID-19.","Chen, Meiqiao; Wu, Yuanbo; Jia, Wei; Yin, Ming; Hu, Zhe; Wang, Rui; Li, Wenting; Wang, Guoping",American journal of translational research,225,22

An immunodominant linear domain was localized within the predicted stalk, S2, of the peplomer. It is recognized by several neutralizing antibodies. Other domains were also identified near the proteolytic cleavage site, in the predicted globular head, S1, and in another part of the stalk. Furthermore, competition results suggest that the immunodominant functional domain forms part of a complex three-dimensional structure.

METHODS Twenty-three SARS patients were enrolled in this study, comprising 15 male and 8 female, aged 27 - 55 years, mean (36 +/- 6) years. They were treated at Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease from February to May in 2003. Chemokines/cytokines in the blood of patients with SARS were dynamically screened by liquid chip system. The lung was studied histopathologically using immunohistochemical technique. Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV was recombined by using insect-baculovirus expression system and Nickel affinity Magnet Beads, and then used to stimulate cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Morphological changes of HUVEC were observed by microscope. Levels of chemokines/cytokines involved in immunoreaction in response to virus infection were detected in the supernatants of those cells cultured with the Spike glycoprotein by liquid chip system. RESULTS Interferon-gamma inducible protein 10 (IP-10) was markedly elevated in the blood during the early stage of SARS [(7,600 +/- 2,400) ng/L, P < 0.01], and remained at a high level in the progressive stage [(8,100 +/- 2,300) ng/L, P < 0.01] and the end stage [(8,000 +/- 2,800) ng/L, P < 0.01] until convalescence [(1,250 +/- 450) ng/L, P > 0.05]. Moreover, IP-10 was highly expressed in the lung. Vacuoles appeared in part of HUVEC after Spike glycoprotein stimulation. As time going on, the HUVEC turned to be round in shape and even disrupted. Under normal condition, no detectable IP-10 was found in HUVEC. A high level of IP-10 [(179 +/- 34), (889 +/- 212), (1,676 +/- 199) ng/L, all P < 0.05] was detected in the HUVEC 12 h after Spike glycoprotein (5, 20, 40 mg/L) stimulation respectively, and presented with a significant dose-dependent response. CONCLUSIONS (1) A significant increase of IP-10 activity in the blood was found in patients with SARS-CoV infection, and remained at a high level until the stage of convalescence. A strong IP-10 protein expression was also found in SARS-CoV infected lung in autopsy. (2) The Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV induced a high level of IP-10 in endothelial cells, which in turn damaged endothelial cells. (3) The Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV induced IP-10 production by a way independent of IFN-gamma.","Yang, Xin-yan; Yao, Guo-hua; Xu, Jun; Zhong, Nan-shan",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,225,17

The gene is expressed as a polyprotein that is processed into individual proteins, presumably by virus-encoded proteinases. ORF 1a has been predicted to encode proteins with similarity to viral and cellular proteinases, such as papain, and to the 3C proteinases of the picornaviruses (A. E. Gorbalenya, A. P. Donchenko, V. M. Blinov, and E. V. Koonin, FEBS Lett. 243:103-114, 1989; A. E. Gorbalenya, E. V. Koonin, A. P. Donchenko, and V. M. Blinov, Nucleic Acids Res. 17:4847-4861, 1989). We have cloned into a T7 transcription vector a cDNA fragment containing the putative 3C-like proteinase domain of MHV-A59, along with portions of the flanking hydrophobic domains. The construct was used to express a polypeptide in a combined in vitro transcription-translation system. Major polypeptides with molecular masses of 38 and 33 kDa were detected at early times, whereas polypeptides with molecular masses of 32 and 27 kDa were predominant after 30 to 45 min and appeared to be products of specific proteolysis of larger precursors. Mutations at the putative catalytic histidine and cysteine residues abolished the processing of the 27-kDa protein. Translation products of the pGpro construct were able to cleave the 27-kDa protein in trans from polypeptides expressed from the noncleaving histidine or cysteine mutants. The amino-terminal cleavage of the 27-kDa protein occurred at a glutamine-serine dipeptide as previously predicted. This study provides experimental confirmation that the coronaviruses express an active proteinase within the 3C-like proteinase domain of gene 1 ORF 1a and that this proteinase utilizes at least one canonical QS dipeptide as a cleavage site in vitro.","Lu, Y; Lu, X; Denison, M R",Journal of virology,225,1

Fecal and nasal swab samples from 85 Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC) feedlot cattle averaging 7 months of age were collected at arrival (0) and at 4, 7, 14, and 21 days postarrival (DPA). An antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect concurrent shedding of BCV in fecal and nasal samples. All samples ELISA positive for BCV were matched with an equal number of BCV ELISA-negative samples and analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the N gene. Paired sera were collected at arrival and 21 DPA and tested for antibodies to BCV using an indirect ELISA. Information on clinical signs, treatments provided, and cattle weights were collected. The overall rates of BCV nasal and fecal shedding were 48% (41/85) and 53% (45/85) by ELISA and 84% (71/85) and 96% (82/85) by RT-PCR, respectively. The peak of BCV nasal and fecal shedding occurred at 4 DPA. Thirty-two cattle (38%) showed concurrent enteric and nasal shedding detected by both tests. Eleven percent of cattle had antibody titers against BCV at 0 DPA and 91% of cattle seroconverted to BCV by 21 DPA. The BCV fecal and nasal shedding detected by ELISA and RT-PCR were statistically correlated with ELISA antibody seroconversion (P < 0.0001); however, BCV fecal and nasal shedding were not significantly related to clinical signs. Seroconversion to BCV was inversely related to average daily weight gains (P < 0.06). Twenty-eight respiratory and 7 enteric BCV strains were isolated from nasal and fetal samples of 32 cattle in HRT-18 cell cultures. These findings confirm the presence of enteric and respiratory BCV infections in feedlot calves. Further studies are needed to elucidate the differences between enteric and respiratory strains of BCV and their role in the bovine respiratory disease complex of feedlot cattle.","Hasoksuz, Mustafa; Hoet, Armando E; Loerch, Steven C; Wittum, Thomas E; Nielsen, Paul R; Saif, Linda J","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",225,21

METHODS Serial assay of serum ALT was followed in patients who fulfilled the WHO criteria of SARS. Those with elevated ALT were compared with those with normal liver functions for clinical outcome. Serology for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was checked. Adverse outcomes were defined as oxygen desaturation, need of intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation and death. RESULTS Two hundred and ninety-four patients were included in this study. Seventy (24%) patients had elevated serum ALT on admission and 204 (69%) patients had elevated ALT during the subsequent course of illness. Using peak ALT >5XULN as a cut-off and after adjusting for potential confounding factors, the odds ratio of peak ALT >5X ULN for oxygen desaturation was 3.24 (95%CI 1.23-8.59, P = 0.018), ICU care was 3.70 (95%CI 1.38-9.89, P = 0.009), mechanical ventilation was 6.64 (95%CI 2.22-19.81, P = 0.001) and death was 7.34 (95%CI 2.28-24.89, P = 0.001).

The aim of this study was to evaluate if lung ultrasound (LUS) may provide valuable prognostic information in adult patients suspected of COVID-19. METHODS A prospective cohort study of adult patients in an ED was conducted. LUS was performed within one hour of the patients' arrival; COVID-19 was defined by a respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA positive test. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients suspected of COVID-19 and normal LUS with critical outcomes during follow-up, defined as one or more of the following: need of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), invasive mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay or death. Follow-up was 14 days. RESULTS A total of 83 patients were included between 9 March and 12 April 2020. In all, 47 (57%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 45.3-67.5%) had a normal LUS, 46 (98%; 95% CI: 88.7-99.9%) of whom had no critical outcomes. A total of 36 (43%; 95% CI: 32.5-54.7%) had an abnormal LUS, eight of whom (22%; 95% CI: 10.1-39.2%) had critical outcomes. Nine (11%; 95%: CI 5.1-19.6%) had one or more critical outcomes: three on NIV, five in ICUs, four on invasive mechanical ventilation and two died. Among the 12 patients (14%; 95% CI: 7.7-23.9%) tested positive for COVID-19, 11 (92%; 95% CI: 61.5-99.8%) had an abnormal LUS.

The rapid spread of the virus and the high number of cases has saturated the health system in our country and has forced many hospitals to redistribute resources to care for infected patients. This has led to asignificant reduction in surgical activity, in some cases reaching the point of delaying all elective interventions by performing only urgent interventions. The decrease in the number of infections with the progressive desaturation of hospitals has currently allowed us to enter a new phase of ""de-escalation"" or transition in order to recover our surgical activity in pediatric urology, which was practically canceled.

It has previously been shown that there is a convergence of neck proprioceptive and vestibular input within the cerebellum to provide a head-on-body reference frame (Manzoni et al. in Neuroscience 93:1095-1107, 1999). The objective of this experiment was to determine whether the direction of the postural response to a vestibular perturbation is modulated when function of the cerebellar vermis is temporarily depressed. Twenty participants were randomly assigned to a SHAM group (paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation) or a TEST group (continuous theta burst stimulation). Stochastic vestibular stimulation (SVS) was applied to standing subjects with their head facing forward or over their left shoulder. Cumulant density traces were established between the SVS and shear force over 180°, and the peak amplitude determined the direction of sway. There were no significant changes in sway direction when the head was facing forward for either stimulation (TEST or SHAM; p = 0.889) or when the head was facing over the shoulder for the SHAM condition (p = 0.954). There was, however, a significant change in sway direction when the head was turned with a depressed cerebellum (p = 0.018); from the expected antero-posterior direction, orthogonal to head orientation, to one slightly more mediolateral with respect to the feet. These results suggest the cerebellum plays a role in the integration of input to generate an appropriately directed postural response relative to the head position.","Lam, Chris K; Tokuno, Craig D; Staines, W Richard; Bent, Leah R",Experimental brain research,225,1

Methods: Semi-structured telephone interviews were performed with 99 patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and 21 controls to explore knowledge, attitudes, practices, and burden in order to elucidate nonadherence to preventive measures. Results: The majority of patients understood the preventive measures and felt sufficiently informed. Analysis of qualitative answers, however, showed that about 30% of patients had an insufficient level of knowledge, which was not associated with educational level, cognitive disorders, or depression. Changes in behaviour were reported by 73 patients (99% performed at least one specific preventive behavior, and 86.9% have reduced social contacts and stayed home). A closer analysis of qualitative answers showed that 27.3% of patients continued to meet relatives face-to-face almost daily. Anxiety and worries about the current situation were reported by 58.6% of patients; 31.3% complained about a decrease in their mobility since the beginning of the restrictions, mainly because of worsening of PD and because regular therapies (e.g., physiotherapy) were canceled. Conclusions: About 30% of PD patients are nonadherent to preventive measures. Use of simple dichotomous questions overestimates adherence to preventive measures in patients with PD.","Zipprich, Hannah M.; Teschner, Ulrike; Witte, Otto W.; Schönenberg, Aline; Prell, Tino",J.

Besides pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, the disease leads to multisystem involvement in the form of myocarditis, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypoxemic brain injury, acute liver and renal function impairment. There are also reports of cutaneous lesions in form of urticarial and maculopapular rashes, chilblain like fingers and toes (covid feet), livedoid vasculopathy and chicken-pox like or varicelliform vesicles. Clinically, many of these skin lesions are likely secondary to occlusion of small to medium blood vessels due to microthrombi formation or due to viral laden antigen-antibody immune complexes; and same explanation may hold true for possible hypoxemic injury simultaneously occurring in other vital organs like lungs, heart, brain and kidneys. The histopathology, immunoflorescence and RT-PCR analysis of skin biopsies can provide useful insights for ascertaining the pathogenesis of this complex viral syndrome. Apparently, it is interplay of disarmed cellular immunity and over-activated humoral immunity that culminates in end-organ changes. The morbidity and mortality can be significantly reduced by upgrading the cellular immunity and downgrading the humoral response; along with prevention of hypoxemic and reperfusion injuries by using antivirals, immunomodulators, antioxidants, anti-platelets and anticoagulants in judicious and phased manner.

We also elaborate some of the shortcomings of in-person conferences, spanning personal, professional, and societal concerns. Recent alternative (virtual) formats for convening scholars provide means for alleviating some of these shortcomings, but do not seem entirely up to the task of providing a fully satisfactory solution to all that conferencing can be. Moreover, we extrapolate from prior history and ongoing trends to predict that technological solutionism to conferencing is likely to unleash both positive and negative dynamics, some of which will exacerbate current ills in our profession. We then sketch out a values-based approach that can serve as a basis for reimagining academic conferences.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included 200 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to University Hospital in Krakow, Poland. In 164 patients, a detailed questionnaire concerning neurological symptoms and signs was performed prospectively within 14 days of hospitalisation. In the remaining 36 patients, such questionnaires were completed retrospectively based on daily observations in the Department of Neurology. RESULTS: During hospitalisation, 169 patients (84.5%) experienced neurological symptoms; the most common were: fatigue (62.5%), decreased mood (45.5%), myalgia (43.5%), and muscle weakness (42.5%). Patients who died during hospitalisation compared to the remainder were older (79 [70.5-88.5] vs. 63.5 [51-77] years, p = 0.001), and more often had decreased level of consciousness (50.0% vs. 9.3%, p < 0.001), delirium (33.3% vs. 4.4%, p < 0.001), arterial hypotension (50.0% vs. 19.6%, p = 0.005) or stroke during (18.8% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.026) or before hospitalisation (50.0% vs. 7.1, p < 0.001), whereas those who survived more often suffered from headache (42.1% vs. 0%, p = 0.012) or decreased mood (51.7% vs. 0%, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Most hospitalised patients with COVID-19 experience neurological symptoms. Decreased level of consciousness, delirium, arterial hypotension, and stroke during or before hospitalisation increase the risk of in-hospital mortality.","Wnuk, Marcin; Sawczynska, Katarzyna; Kesek, Tomasz; Wrona, Pawel; Chatys-Bogacka, Zaneta; Mazurkiewicz, Iwona; Drabik, Leszek; Jagiella, Jeremiasz; Szaleniec, Joanna; Czepiel, Jacek; Pawlinski, Lukasz; Bien, Artur Igor; Kania, Michal; Fiema, Mateusz; Zieba-Parkitny, Joanna; Hajek, Agnes; Ucieklak, Damian; Wilk, Magdalena; Pospiech, Kamila; Lechowicz, Patrycja; Kasprzycki, Karol; Kopka, Marianna; Hohendorff, Jerzy; Katra, Barbara; Kostrzycka, Malgorzata; Adamczyk, Michalina; Surowiec, Paulina; Rybicka, Monika; Walczewska, Jolanta; Kaminska, Barbara; Pietak, Ewelina; Bryniarski, Pawel; Marona, Monika; Motyl, Maciej; Kepinska-Wnuk, Alicja; Wlodarczyk, Malgorzata; Nowak, Klaudia; Gradek-Kwinta, Elzbieta; Czyzycki, Mateusz; Dwojak, Mateusz; Rzeminska, Agnieszka; Wezyk, Kamil; Kozminski, Wojciech; Pulyk, Agnieszka; Garlicki, Aleksander; Grodzicki, Tomasz; Malecki, Maciej; Slowik, Agnieszka",Neurol Neurochir Pol,225,20

This study tracked the daily dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Honolulu during a rapidly expanding COVID-19 outbreak and a responding four-week lockdown that resulted in a rapid decrease of daily clinical COVID-19 new cases. The wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration from both WWTPs, as measured by three quantification assays (N1, N2, and E), exhibited both significant inter-day fluctuations (101.2-105.1 gene copies or GC/L in wastewater liquid fractions, or 101.4-106.2 GC/g in solid fractions) and an overall downward trend over the lockdown period. Strong and significant correlation was observed in measured SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations between the solid and liquid wastewater fractions, with the solid fraction containing majority (82.5%-92.5%) of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA mass and the solid-liquid SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration ratios ranging from 103.6 to 104.3 mL/g. The measured wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration was normalized by three endogenous fecal RNA viruses (F+ RNA coliphages Group II and III, and pepper mild mottle virus) to account for variations that may occur during the multi-step wastewater processing and molecular quantification, and the normalized abundance also exhibited similar daily fluctuations and overall downward trend over the sampling period.","Li, Bo; Di, Doris Yoong Wen; Saingam, Prakit; Jeon, Min Ki; Yan, Tao",Water Res,225,6

The project was undertaken over an 18-month period in one state of Australia, offering structured, temporary exchange of personnel between metropolitan and rural health services. BACKGROUND: Globally, there is an increasing awareness of nursing shortages, and with it, the need to ensure that nurses and midwives are prepared for specialist roles and practice. This is particularly important in rural and remote areas, where there are pre-existing barriers to access to services, and difficulties in attracting suitably qualified, permanent staff. METHODS: A mixed methods approach to the evaluation was undertaken with two cohorts. One cohort was the nurses and midwives who participated in the exchange (n = 24) and the other cohort were managers of the participating health services (n = 10). The nurses and midwives who participated in the exchange were asked to complete a questionnaire that included questions related to embeddedness and job satisfaction. The managers participated in a Delphi series of interviews. RESULTS: Those who participated in exchange reporting a higher score on the reported degree of understanding of rural client, which was accompanied with a moderate-to-large effect size estimate (d = 0.61). Nurses/midwives in the exchange group reported higher scores on their perceptions of aspects of their home community that would be lost if they had to leave, which was accompanied with a large effect size (d = 0.83). Overall, NMEP was reported by the participants to be a positive way to improve professional development opportunities for nurses and midwives. The findings also show the program supported practical collaboration and raised the profile of nursing and midwifery in rural areas. CONCLUSION: Exchange programs support clinical and professional development, raising the awareness of different contexts of practice and related skills requirements, and thereby supporting a greater understanding of different nursing roles. In the light of increasingly complex care required by patients with chronic conditions being managed in community-based services, programs such as NMEP provide the opportunity to build collaborative networks between referring and referral centres as well as contribute to the ongoing skills development.","Byrne, Amy-Louise; Harvey, Clare; Chamberlain, Diane; Baldwin, Adele; Heritage, Brody; Wood, Elspeth",PLoS One,225,30

Many international borders were closed and populations were confined to their homes, which reduced transport and changed consumption patterns. Here we compile government policies and activity data to estimate the decrease in CO2emissions during forced confinements. Daily global CO2emissions decreased by –17% (–11 to –25% for ±1σ) by early April 2020 compared with the mean 2019 levels, just under half from changes in surface transport. At their peak, emissions in individual countries decreased by –26% on average. The impact on 2020 annual emissions depends on the duration of the confinement, with a low estimate of –4% (–2 to –7%) if prepandemic conditions return by mid-June, and a high estimate of –7% (–3 to –13%) if some restrictions remain worldwide until the end of 2020.

To address this pressing issue, we developed the MyREADY TransitionTM BBD App, a patient-facing e-health intervention. The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to determine whether the App will result in greater transition readiness compared with usual care for youth with BBD. Secondary aims included exploring the contextual experiences of youth using the App, as well as the interactive processes of youth, their parents/caregivers and healthcare providers around use of the intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We aimed to randomise 264 youth with BBD between 15 and 17 years of age, to receive existing services/usual care (control group) or to receive usual care along with the App (intervention group). Our recruitment strategy includes remote and virtual options in response to the current requirements for physical distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will use an embedded experimental model design which involves embedding a qualitative study within a RCT. The Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire will be administered as the primary outcome measure. Analysis of covariance will be used to compare change in the two groups on the primary outcome measure; analysis will be intention-to-treat. Interviews will be conducted with subsets of youth in the intervention group, as well as parents/caregivers and healthcare providers. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the research ethics board of each participating site in four different regions in Canada. We will leverage our patient and family partnerships to find novel dissemination strategies.

The aim of our study is to assess the association of an increased FIB-4 score with COVID-19 disease prognosis. Methods: We performed a prospective study on hospitalized patients with known type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and confirmed COVID-19, with imaging evidence of liver steatosis within the last year or known diagnosis of MAFLD. All individuals were screened for liver fibrosis with a FIB-4 index. We evaluated the link between FIB-4 and disease prognosis. Results: Of 138 participants, 91.3% had MAFLD and 21.5% patients had a high risk of fibrosis. In the latter group of patients, the number of severe forms of disease, the hospital stay length, the rate of ICU admissions and the number of deaths reported registered a statistically significant increase. The independent predictors for developing severe forms of COVID-19 were obesity (odds ratio (OR), 3.24; 95% confidence interval (CI), p = 0.003), higher values of ferritin (OR-1.9; 95% CI, 1.17-8.29, p = 0.031) and of FIB-4 &#8805; 3.25 (OR-4.89; 95% CI, 1.34-12.3, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Patients with high scores of FIB-4 have poor clinical outcomes and liver fibrosis may have a relevant prognostic role. Although the link between liver fibrosis and the prognosis of COVD-19 needs to be evaluated in further studies, screening for liver fibrosis with FIB-4 index, particularly in patients at risk, such as those with T2DM, will make a huge contribution to patient risk stratification.","Calapod, Ovidiu P; Marin, Andreea M; Onisai, Minodora; Tribus, Laura C; Pop, Corina S; Fierbinteanu-Braticevici, Carmen",Medicina (Kaunas),225,16

METHODS: We evaluated 159 patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), 38 of whom with NIV as the ceiling of treatment, admitted to an ordinary ward and treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and respiratory physiotherapy. Treatment failure and death were correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters in the whole cohort and in patients with NIV as the ceiling of treatment. RESULTS: Patients who had NIV as the ceiling of treatment were elderly, with a low BMI and a high burden of comorbidities, showed clinical and laboratory signs of multi-organ insufficiency on admission and of rapidly deteriorating vital signs during the first week of treatment. NIV failure occurred overall in 77 (48%) patients, and 27/38 patients with NIV as the ceiling of treatment died. Congestive heart failure, chronic benign haematological diseases and inability/refusal to receive respiratory physiotherapy were independently associated to NIV failure and mortality. Need for increased positive end-expiratory pressures and low platelets were associated with NIV failure. Death was associated to cerebrovascular disease, need for CPAP cycles longer than 12h and, in the subgroup of patients with NIV as the ceiling of treatment, was heralded by vital sign deterioration within 48 h.

Contemporary life selects and synthesizes only one of two possible handednesses. In an abiotic environment, however, there are usually equally many left- and right-handed molecules. If homochirality was a prerequisite of life, there must have been physical or chemical circumstances that led to the selection of a certain preference. Conversely, if it was a consequence of life, we must identify possible pathways for accomplishing a transition from a racemic to a homochiral chemistry. After a discussion of the observational evidence, I will review ideas where homochirality of any handedness could emerge as a consequence of the first polymerization events of nucleotides in an emerging RNA world. These mechanisms are not limited to nucleotides, but can also occur for peptides, as a precursor to the RNA world. The question of homochirality is, in this sense, intimately tied to the origin of life. Future Mars missions may be able to detect biomolecules of extant or extinct life.

Non-parametric tests of medians were used to compare the median DES score, Chi-square test to compare categorical variables, and binary logistic regression to find the predictors of DES. Results: The prevalence of eye strain was higher among students taking online classes compared to the general public (50.6% vs 33.2%; &#967;2 = 22.5, df = 1, p < .0001). There was an increase in screen time during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic time. The DES score was highest among students attending online classes (p < .0001), in those with eye diseases (p = .001), greater screen time (p = <0.0001), screen distance <20 cm (p = .002), those who used gadgets in dark (p = .017) and those who took infrequent/no breaks (p = .018). The DES scores were proportional to the increase in the number of hours of gadget usage during the pandemic. Conclusion: There is a need to educate people about limiting overall screen exposure and ergonomic methods of screen viewing. Efforts from policymakers to reduce the duration of online classes for students and online work hours for professionals are warranted to control this epidemic of eye strain.","Ganne, Pratyusha; Najeeb, Shaista; Chaitanya, Ganne; Sharma, Aditya; Krishnappa, Nagesha C",Ophthalmic Epidemiol,225,30

Methods: this was a 4-month (12th March to 12th July 2020) cross sectional study carried out in the intensive care unit of the COVID treatment center of Donka National Hospital, the only hospital with a COVID intensive care unit in Guinea. Results: during our period of study 140 patients were hospitalized in the COVID intensive care unit and 35 patients died (25%). In univariate analysis, the occurrence of death was associated with: confusional syndrome (p<0.001), time to admission (p<0.001), use of an inotropic or vasopressor (p<0.001), Brescia score &#8805; 2 (p=0.004), non-invasive ventilation (p=0.011), stroke (p=0.014), Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (p=0.015), male (p=0.021), provenance (p=0.021), acute renal failure (p=0.022), pulmonary embolism (p=0.022), invasive ventilation (p=0.022), and age > 60 years (p=0.047). In multivariate analysis, the factors predictive of mortality were: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (OR= 6.33, 95% CI [1.66-29]; p=0.007), a Brescia score &#8805; 2 (OR =5.8, 95% CI [1.7-19.2]; p=0.004) and admission delay (OR =5.6, 95% CI [1.8-17.5]; p=0.003). Conclusion: our study shows that the acute respiratory distress syndrome, then the Brescia score &#8805; 2, and finally the time to admission to intensive care were all associated with an increased risk of death for patients. These results are different from those reported in Asia, Europe and North America.","Donamou, Joseph; Touré, Abdoulaye; Camara, Amadou Yalla; Camara, Djiki; Camara, M039; Lamine, mah; Traoré, Abdourhamane Dine; Camara, Mariame Mohamed; Bangoura, Almamy; Dramé, Boubacar Atigou; Sossa, Luc Kouessi; Abékan, Jean-Marc Roméo; Edemessi, Axel Irvin; Saliou, Sow Mamadou",Pan Afr Med J,225,15

MATERIAL AND METHODS: During lockdown, an online questionnaire registered demographic, health data, previous psychiatric history, current anxiety, depression and suicidality, believing in conspiracy theories and other domains. Data from 3399 persons were used (81.08% females; aged 34.02 ± 9.72 and 18.27% males; aged 36.38±10.33). Distress and clinical depression were identified with the use of cut-off and a previously developed algorithm respectively. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A post-stratification method was used; descriptive statistics were calculated. Chi-square tests, multiple forward stepwise linear regression analyses and Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tested relations among variables. RESULTS: Clinical depression was present in 9.31% of the stratified sample, while 8.5% had severe distress; increased anxiety was present in more than 45%. Suicidal thoughts increased in 10.40% and decreased in 4.42%. Beliefs in conspiracy theories were widely prevalent; at least half of cases were following various misconceptions. A model for the development of depression was created with general health status, previous history of depression, self-harm and suicidal attempts, family responsibility, economic change, and age acting as risk factors, while keeping a daily routine, pursuing religiousness/spirituality, and believing in conspiracy theories acting as protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: The model developed here revealed multiple vulnerabilities and an interplay leading from simple anxiety to clinical depression and suicidality through distress. This could be of practical utility since most of these factors are modifiable. Future research, as well as interventions, should focus specifically on them.","Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Apostolidou, Maria K; Atsiova, Marina B; Filippidou, Anna K; Florou, Angeliki K; Gousiou, Dimitra S; Katsara, Aikaterini R; Mantzari, Sofia N; Padouva-Markoulaki, Marina; Papatriantafyllou, Evangelia I; Sacharidi, Panagiota I; Tonia, Aikaterini I; Tsagalidou, Eleni G; Zymara, Vasiliki P; Prezerakos, Panagiotis E; Koupidis, Sotirios A; Fountoulakis, Nikolaos K; Chrousos, George P",J Affect Disord,225,30

In this work, we describe the atomic manner of this virus in contact with various metallic matrix such as Fe, Al, and steel with equilibrium molecular dynamic method. For this purpose, we reported physical properties such as temperature, total energy, distance and angle of structures, mutual energy, and volume variation of coronavirus. In this approach, coronavirus is precisely simulated by O, C, S, and N atoms and they are implemented dreiding force field. Our simulation shows that virus interaction with steel matrix causes the maximum removing of the virus from the surfaces. After 1 ns, the atomic distance between these two structures increases from 45 to 75 Å. Furthermore, the volume of coronavirus 14.62% increases after interaction with steel matrix. This atomic manner shows that coronavirus removes and destroyed with steel surface, and this metallic structure can be a promising material for use in medical applications.","Karimipour, Aliakbar; Amini, Ali; Nouri, Mohammad; D039,; Orazio, Annunziata; Sabetvand, Roozbeh; Hekmatifar, Maboud; Marjani, Azam; Bach, Quang-Vu",Comput Part Mech,225,12

This essay searches for a philosophical rationale for rejecting challenge trials while supposing that they have huge benefits and relatively low risks. Although it finds some force in objections to challenge trials grounded in the obligations of researchers to limit the harms imposed on some individuals for the benefit of others, it argues that there is no compelling objection to challenge trials of vaccines for COVID-19-if they have the benefits and risks that have been claimed.","Hausman, Daniel M",J. med. philos,225,26

In addition, the impacts of the COVID-19 event on the air quality in the three cities in 2020 were compared and discussed. For the combined AQIs for the three cities, in spring, the daily AQIs ranged between 25 and 182 and averaged 72.1. In summer, the daily AQIs ranged between 24 and 206 and averaged 77.5. In autumn, the daily AQIs ranged between 22 and 170 and averaged 61.1, and in winter, the daily AQIs ranged between 28 and 375 and averaged 99.6. The distributions of the six AQI classes in spring were 3%, 94%, 3%, 0%, 0%, and 0%; in summer, they were 11%, 74%, 15%, 0%, 0% and 0%; in autumn, they were 29%, 70%, 1%, 0%, 0%, and 0%, and in winter, they were 1%, 52%, 44%, 3%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. The average AQIs, in order, were Chengdu (85.4) &gt; Chongqing (73.8) &gt; Luzhou (73.2). Both the highest AQIs and PM 2.5(as the major indicatory air pollutant) occurred mainly in the low temperature season (January, December, and February), while O 3was the main air pollutant in June and August when the weather was hot. In February 2020, during the epidemic prevention and control actions taken in response to COVID-19 for the three cities, the combined AQIs for the top five days with the highest AQIs in February 2020 was 79.4, which was 23.6% lower than that from 2017–2019 (AQI = 100.7), and the average concentrations of PM 2.5, PM 10, SO 2, CO, and NO 2were 89.4 µg m –3, 106 µg m –3, 2.31 ppb, 0.72 ppm, and 12.3 ppb, respectively, and were 17.9%, 30.8%, 83.8%, 19.8%, and 62.1%, lower than those in February 2017–2019. However, the average O 3concentration (31.8 ppb) in February 2020 rather than decreasing, increased by 6.2%. This is because a lower NO 2concentration hindered the NO + O 3reaction and led to increase O 3concentration in the ambient air.","Zhang, Jiajia; Cui, Kangping; Wang, Ya-Fen; Wu, Jhong-Lin; Huang, Wei-Syun; Wan, Shun; Xu, Kaijie",Aerosol Air Qual.

Une enquête a été mise en place afin d’objectiver l’impact de la pandémie sur cette population spécifique. Matériels et méthodes Un web questionnaire a été proposé mi-avril 2020 à tous les établissements de santé (ES) publics ou privés. Les ES volontaires saisissent de manière hebdomadaire le nombre de nouveaux PES infectés et les décès attribuables. Un cas est défini comme tout salarié, symptomatique ou non, testé positif pour le SARS-CoV-2 par RT-PCR, ou par sérologie (à partir de juillet 2020) ou par test antigénique (à partir de novembre 2020) ou reconnu comme infecté par la cellule « COVID-19 » ou le référent infectiologue de l’ES. La région, le type d’ES, la catégorie professionnelle et le service sont également recueillis. Les proportions de PES infectés ont été estimées en rapportant le nombre de cas aux données de la Statistique annuelle des établissements de santé 2019. Résultats Plus de 1300 ES ont participé au moins une fois à l’enquête. Entre le 1er mars 2020 et le 29 mars 2021, 76 089 PES, correspondant à 8 % des PES exerçant dans les ES participants ont été infectés par le SARS-CoV2, avec 19 décès attribuables. Parmi ces PES, la majorité (72 %) étaient des soignants. La répartition hebdomadaire du nombre de cas montre 3 pics de contamination en mars, octobre 2020 et janvier 2021. Les 2 professions ayant déclaré le plus de cas étaient les infirmiers (24 % des cas) et les aides-soignants (21 % des cas). Les aides-soignants et les kinésithérapeutes rapportaient les plus grandes proportions de PES infectés, respectivement 9,5 % et 9,0 % que ce soit pendant la 1re vague ou la 2e vague.

In this regard, lichen metabolites may offer a vast reservoir for the discovery of antiviral drug candidates. Therefore, to find novel compounds against COVID-19, we created a library of 412 lichen compounds and subjected to virtual screening against the SARS-CoV-2 Main protease (Mpro). All the ligands were virtually screened, and 27 compounds were found to have high affinity with Mpro. These compounds were assessed for drug-likeness analysis where two compounds were found to fit well for redocking studies. Molecular docking, drug-likeness, X-Score, and toxicity analysis resulting in two lichen compounds, Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid with Mpro-inhibiting activity. These compounds were finally subjected to molecular dynamics simulation to compare the dynamics behavior and stability of the Mpro after ligand binding. The binding energy was calculated by MM-PBSA method to determine the intermolecular protein-ligand interactions. Our results showed that two compounds; Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid had the binding free energy of - 42.42 kJ mol/1 and - 57.85 kJ mol/1 respectively as compared to reference X77 (- 91.78 kJ mol/1). We concluded that Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid show considerable structural and pharmacological properties and they can be used as hit compounds to develop potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. These lichen compounds may be a suitable candidate for further experimental analysis.","Joshi, Tanuja; Sharma, Priyanka; Joshi, Tushar; Pundir, Hemlata; Mathpal, Shalini; Chandra, Subhash",Mol. divers,225,1

Among 1417 participants, 387(27.0%) were frontline healthcare workers and 1035(73.0%) were residents from the general public. Their COVID-19 psychological status was evaluated using Patient Health Questionnaire-9(PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C). Results show that 16.1%,22.3% and 17.2% healthcare workers and 21.2%, 16.7% and 17.2% general public had symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD ranging from moderate to severe. Anxiety levels were not significantly different between healthcare workers and the general public. The decreased income and the frequent social media exposure are the risk factors for general public.

Our finding can be used to help the government of Wuhan to develop psychological interventions to improve the mental health of the population and work as a reference of public health guidelines for other cities with severe COVID-19 outbreak.","Lu, Peixin; Li, Xin; Lu, Long; Zhang, Yue",PLoS One,225,20

Our aim was to compare the clinical outcomes of patients with and without T2DM during the first hit of COVID-19 in Istanbul. METHODS: A retrospective population-based study was conducted including all consecutive adult symptomatic COVID-19 cases. Patients were confirmed with rt-PCR; treated and monitored in accordance with standard protocols. The primary endpoints were hospitalization and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Of the 93,571 patients, 22.6% had T2DM, with older age and higher BMI. Propensity Score matched evaluation resulted in significantly higher rates of hospitalization (1.5-fold), 30-day mortality (1.6-fold), and pneumonia (1.4-fold). They revealed more severe laboratory deviations, comorbidities, and frequent drug usage than the Non-DM group. In T2DM age, pneumonia, hypertension, obesity, and insulin-based therapies were associated with an increased likelihood of hospitalization; whereas age, male gender, lymphopenia, obesity, and insulin treatment were considerably associated with higher odds of death. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with T2DM had worse clinical outcomes with higher hospitalization and 30-day mortality rates than those without diabetes. Compared to most territories of the world, COVID-19 mortality was much lower in Istanbul, which may be associated with accessible healthcare provision and the younger structure of the population.","Satman, Ilhan; Demirci, Ibrahim; Haymana, Cem; Tasci, Ilker; Salman, Serpil; Ata, Naim; Dagdelen, Selcuk; Sahin, Ibrahim; Emral, Rifat; Cakal, Erman; Atmaca, Aysegul; Sahin, Mustafa; Celik, Osman; Demir, Tevfik; Ertugrul, Derun; Unluturk, Ugur; Arga, Kazim Yalcin; Caglayan, Murat; Sonmez, Alper",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,225,20

The COVID-19 pandemic, like a natural disaster, brought uncertainties and instability to the economic development of the society and social distancing, which might lead to child maltreatment. This study aims to investigate whether job loss, income reduction and parenting affect child maltreatment. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of 600 randomly sampled parents aged 18 years or older who had and lived with a child under 10 years old in Hong Kong between 29 May to 16 June 2020. Participants were recruited from a random list of mobile phone numbers of a panel of parents. Of 779 recruited target parents, 600 parents completed the survey successfully via a web-based system after obtaining their online consent for participating in the survey. Results: Income reduction was found significantly associated with severe (OR = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.06, 10.25) and very severe physical assaults (OR = 7.69, 95% CI = 2.24, 26.41) towards children. Job loss or large income reduction were also significantly associated with severe (OR= 3.68, 95% CI = 1.33, 10.19) and very severe physical assaults (OR = 4.05, 95% CI = 1.17, 14.08) towards children. However, income reduction (OR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.15, 0.53) and job loss (OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.28, 0.76) were significantly associated with less psychological aggression. Exposure to intimate partner violence between parents is a very strong and significant factor associated with all types of child maltreatment. Having higher levels of difficulty in discussing COVID-19 with children was significantly associated with more corporal punishment (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.34), whereas having higher level of confidence in managing preventive COVID-19 behaviors with children was negatively associated with corporal punishment (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.76, 0.99) and very severe physical assaults (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.58, 0.93). Conclusions: Income instability such as income reduction and job loss amplified the risk of severe and very severe child physical assaults but protected children from psychological aggression. Also, confidence in teaching COVID-19 and managing preventive COVID-19 behaviors with children was significantly negatively associated with corporal punishment during pandemic.","Wong, Janet Yuen-Ha; Wai, Abraham Ka-Chung; Wang, Man Ping; Lee, Jung Jae; Li, Matthew; Kwok, Jojo Yan-Yan; Wong, Carlos King-Ho; Choi, Anna Wai-Man",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),225,20

Nevertheless, the risk of QT prolongation due to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between hydroxychloroquine and concomitant medications has not yet been identified. To evaluate the risk of QT prolongation due to DDIs between hydroxychloroquine and 118 concurrent drugs frequently used in real-world practice, we analyzed the electrocardiogram results obtained for 447,632 patients and their relevant electronic health records in a tertiary teaching hospital in Korea from 1996 to 2018. We repeated the case-control analysis for each drug. In each analysis, we performed multiple logistic regression and calculated the odds ratio (OR) for each target drug, hydroxychloroquine, and the interaction terms between those two drugs. The DDIs were observed in 12 drugs (trimebutine, tacrolimus, tramadol, rosuvastatin, cyclosporin, sulfasalazine, rofecoxib, diltiazem, piperacillin/tazobactam, isoniazid, clarithromycin, and furosemide), all with a p value of < 0.05 (OR 1.70-17.85).

Objective: to assess the effects of the COVID-19 on the physical and mental health of non-health workers. Design: observational descriptive cross-sectional study. Data sources: 1089 questionnaires have been analysed. Engagement (UWES-9), sense of coherence (SOC-13), mental health (Goldberg GHQ-12), demographic data, perception of health and stress and work environment were assessed. Results: At low levels of engagement, the percentage of distress is higher (77.9%). Low levels of sense of coherence correspond to the highest percentages of distress (86.3%). The 94.1% believe it necessary for professionals and volunteers involved in COVID-19 to receive psychological support. Low comprehensibility is mediated by the perception of stress; if the perception is low, comprehensibility is modulated by the level of significance; if it is low, it generates 95.9% of distress. Conclusion: the interrelationship between the sense of coherence, work environment, work engagement, and psychological distress have particular interest in non-health workers who carried out essential activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The crystallographic structure of Mpro in an apo form was retrieved from Protein Data Bank and marine compounds from PubChem. These structures were prepared for docking and the complex with good docking score was subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations for a period of 100 ns. To measure the stability, flexibility, and average distance between the target and compounds, root mean square deviations (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and the distance matrix were calculated. Among five marine compounds, C-1 (PubChem CID 11170714) exhibited good activity, interacting with the active site and surrounding residues, forming many hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. The C-1 also attained a stable dynamic behavior, and the average distance between compound and target remains constant. In conclusion, marine natural compounds may be used as a potential inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 for better management of COVID-19.[Figure: see text].","Khan, Muhammad Tahir; Ali, Arif; Wang, Qiankun; Irfan, Muhammad; Khan, Abbas; Zeb, Muhammad Tariq; Zhang, Yu-Juan; Chinnasamy, Sathishkumar; Wei, Dong-Qing",J Biomol Struct Dyn,225,1

We also discuss the differences in the immune responses by which, in most children, the infection results in only mild disease, although causing severe disease in some adults. Understanding these differences in both the innate and adaptive immune responses among these people can lead to the development of biotherapeutic treatment modalities that could modulate immune responses to offer protection against SARS-CoV-2 and block the ability of the virus to cause severe disease or death in humans.

Various simulation-based studies have been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of these measures. While those studies unanimously confirm the mitigating effect of social distancing on disease spread, the reported effectiveness varies from 10% to more than 90% reduction in the number of infections. This level of uncertainty is mostly due to the complex dynamics of epidemics and their time-variant parameters. However, real transactional data can reduce uncertainty and provide a less noisy picture of the effectiveness of social distancing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to integrate multiple transactional data sets (GPS mobility data from Google and Apple as well as disease statistics from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) to study the role of social distancing policies in 26 countries and analyze the transmission rate of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic over the course of 5 weeks. METHODS: Relying on the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and official COVID-19 reports, we first calculated the weekly transmission rate (ß) of COVID-19 in 26 countries for 5 consecutive weeks. Then, we integrated these data with the Google and Apple mobility data sets for the same time frame and used a machine learning approach to investigate the relationship between the mobility factors and ß values. RESULTS: Gradient boosted trees regression analysis showed that changes in mobility patterns resulting from social distancing policies explain approximately 47% of the variation in the disease transmission rates. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with simulation-based studies, real cross-national transactional data confirms the effectiveness of social distancing interventions in slowing the spread of COVID-19. In addition to providing less noisy and more generalizable support for the idea of social distancing, we provide specific insights for public health policy makers regarding locations that should be given higher priority for enforcing social distancing measures.","Delen, Dursun; Eryarsoy, Enes; Davazdahemami, Behrooz",JMIR Public Health Surveill,225,16

In this manuscript, we prove that the method of using the cumulative CFR is static and does not reflect the trend according to the daily change per unit of time. METHODS: A proportion meta-analysis was carried out on the CFR in every country reporting COVID-19 cases. Based on these results, we performed a meta-analysis for a global COVID-19 CFR. Each analysis was performed using two different calculations of CFR: according to the calendar date and according to the days since the outbreak of the first confirmed case. We thus explored an innovative and original calculation of CFR, concurrently based on the date of the first confirmed case as well as on a daily basis. RESULTS: For the first time, we showed that using meta-analyses according to the calendar date and days since the outbreak of the first confirmed case, were different. CONCLUSION: We propose that a CFR according to days since the outbreak of the first confirmed case might be a better predictor of the current CFR of COVID-19 and its kinetics.","Ghayda, Ramy Abou; Lee, Keum Hwa; Han, Young Joo; Ryu, Seohyun; Hong, Sung Hwi; Yoon, Sojung; Jeong, Gwang Hun; Lee, Jinhee; Lee, Jun Young; Yang, Jae Won; Effenberger, Maria; Eisenhut, Michael; Kronbichler, Andreas; Solmi, Marco; Li, Han; Jacob, Louis; Koyanagi, Ai; Radua, Joaquim; Shin, Jae Il; Smith, Lee",Int J Infect Dis,225,29

(Special Issue: COVID-19: lessons for public health.),20.185093,1.9407468,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: While the entire world is still experiencing the dramatic emergency due to SARS-CoV-2, Italy has a prominent position since it has been the locus of the first major outbreak among Western countries. The aim of this study is the evaluation of temporal connection between SARS-CoV-2 positive tests (cases) and deaths in Italy in the first wave of the epidemic. METHODS: A temporal link between cases and deaths was determined by comparing their daily/weekly trends using surveillance data of the period March 2-June 2020. RESULTS: The monitoring of the cases/deaths evolution during the first wave of the outbreak highlights a striking correlation between infections of a certain week and deaths of the following one. We defined a weekly lethality rate that is virtually unchanged over the entire months of April and May until the first week of June (&#8776;13.6%). Due to the rather low number of cases/deaths, this parameter starts to fluctuate in the following three weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis indicates that the weekly lethality rate is virtually unchanged over the entire first wave of the epidemic, despite the progressive increase of the testing. As observed for the overall lethality, this parameter uniformly presents rather high values. The definition of a temporal link between cases and deaths will likely represent a useful tool for highlighting analogies and differences between the first and the second wave of the pandemic and for evaluating the effectiveness, even if partial, of the strategies applied during the ongoing outbreak.

The total nucleic acid contents of samples from 159 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were subjected to whole genome sequencing. The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from these patients were examined for variants in spike protein RBD. In January 2021, three family members (one aged in their 40s and two aged under 10 years old) were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 harboring W152L/E484K/G769V mutations. These three patients were living in Japan and had no history of traveling abroad. After identifying these cases, we developed a TaqMan assay to screen for the above hallmark mutations and identified an additional 14 patients with the same mutations. The associated virus strain was classified into the GR clade (Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data [GISAID]), 20B clade (Nextstrain), and R.1 lineage (Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak [PANGO] Lineages). As of April 22, 2021, R.1 lineage SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in 2,388 SARS-CoV-2 entries in the GISAID database, many of which were from Japan (38.2%; 913/2,388) and the United States (47.1%; 1,125/2,388). Compared with that in the United States, the percentage of SARS-CoV-2 isolates belonging to the R.1 lineage in Japan increased more rapidly over the period from October 24, 2020 to April 18, 2021. R.1 lineage SARS-CoV-2 has potential escape mutations in the spike protein RBD (E484K) and N-terminal domain (W152L); therefore, it will be necessary to continue to monitor the R.1 lineage as it spreads around the world.","Hirotsu, Yosuke; Omata, Masao",PLoS Pathog,225,16

Since its first report, SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic, with over 10 million human infections and over 560,000 deaths reported worldwide at the end of June 2020. Currently, there are no United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines and/or antivirals licensed against SARS-CoV-2. The high economical and health impacts of SARS-CoV-2 has placed global pressure on the scientific community to identify effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease. While some compounds have been already reported to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and a handful of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been described that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need for the development and standardization of assays which can be used in high through-put screening (HTS) settings to identify new antivirals and/or neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we described a rapid, accurate, and highly reproducible plaque reduction microneutralization (PRMNT) assay that can be quickly adapted for the identification and characterization of both neutralizing mAbs and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.

Many questions remain about asymptomatic or atypical infections and transmission dynamics. We used comprehensive contact tracing of the first 2 confirmed patients in Illinois with COVID-19 and serologic SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing to determine whether contacts had evidence of undetected COVID-19. METHODS: Contacts were eligible for serologic follow-up if previously tested for COVID-19 during an initial investigation or had greater-risk exposures. Contacts completed a standardized questionnaire during the initial investigation. We classified exposure risk as high, medium, or low based on interactions with 2 index patients and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Serologic testing used a SARS-CoV-2 spike enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on serum specimens collected from participants approximately 6 weeks after initial exposure to either index patient. The 2 index patients provided serum specimens throughout their illness. We collected data on demographic, exposure, and epidemiologic characteristics. RESULTS: Of 347 contacts, 110 were eligible for serologic follow-up; 59 (17% of all contacts) enrolled. Of these, 53 (90%) were health care personnel and 6 (10%) were community contacts. Seventeen (29%) reported high-risk exposures, 15 (25%) medium-risk, and 27 (46%) low-risk. No participant had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The 2 index patients had antibodies detected at dilutions >1:6400 within 4 weeks after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: In serologic follow-up of the first 2 known patients in Illinois with COVID-19, we found no secondary transmission among tested contacts. Lack of seroconversion among these contacts adds to our understanding of conditions (ie, use of PPE) under which SARS-CoV-2 infections might not result in transmission and demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is a useful tool to verify epidemiologic findings.","McPherson, Tristan D; Ghinai, Isaac; Binder, Alison M; Freeman, Brandi D; Hoskin Snelling, Chantel; Hunter, Jennifer C; Anderson, Kristin M; Davenport, Polly; Rudd, Deborah L; Zafer, Mujeeb; Christiansen, Demian; Joshi, Kiran; Rubin, Rachel; Black, Stephanie R; Fricchione, Marielle J; Pacilli, Massimo; Walblay, Kelly A; Korpics, Jacqueline; Moeller, Darcie; Quartey-Kumapley, Pearl; Wang, Chen; Charles, E Matt; Kauerauf, Judy; Patel, Megan T; Disari, Vishal S; Fischer, Marc; Jacobs, Max W; Lester, Sandra N; Midgley, Claire M; Rasheed, Mohammed Ata Ur; Reese, Heather E; Verani, Jennifer R; Wallace, Megan; Watson, John T; Thornburg, Natalie J; Layden, Jennifer E; Kirking, Hannah L",Public Health Rep,225,1

OBJECTIVES: To summarize the existing literature on COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and childbirth, particularly concerning clinical presentation and outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY: A systematic search of LitCovid, EBSCO MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus electronic databases. The references of relevant studies were also searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Identified titles and abstracts were screened to select original reports and cross-checked for overlap of cases. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A descriptive summary organized by aspects of clinical presentations (symptoms, imaging, and laboratory) and outcomes (maternal and perinatal). MAIN RESULTS: We identified 33 studies reporting 385 pregnant women with COVID-19 infection: 368 (95.6%) mild; 14 (3.6%) severe; and 3 (0.8%) critical. Seventeen women were admitted to intensive care, including six who were mechanically ventilated and one maternal mortality. A total of 252 women gave birth, comprising 175 (69.4%) cesarean and 77 (30.6%) vaginal births. Outcomes for 256 newborns included four RT-PCR positive neonates, two stillbirths, and one neonatal death.

Instead of one reproduction number there now are four parameters. These make it possible to quantify the effect of the social distancing measures. There is a simple stochastic model for epidemics in a two type population. Apart from the size of the population of the vulnerable and the fit, and the initial number of infected in the two classes, only the four reproduction parameters are needed to run the two type Reed-Frost model. The program is simple and fast. On a pc it takes less than five minutes to do a hundred thousand simulations of the epidemic for a population of the size of the US. Epidemics are non-linear processes. Results may be counterintuitive. The average number of vulnerable persons infected by an infectious fit person is a crucial parameter of the epidemic in the two type population. Intuitively this parameter should be small. However simulations show that even if this parameter is small the death toll may be higher than without shielding. Under certain conditions increasing the value of the parameter may reduce the death toll. The article addresses these blind spots in our intuition.","Balkema, Guus",,225,20

Numerous variants have emerged in SARS-CoV-2 that are currently posing a serious challenge to the global vaccination effort and COVID-19 management. The evolutionary dynamics of this virus are only beginning to be explored. In this work, we have analysed 1.79 million spike glycoprotein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and found that the virus is fine-tuning the spike with numerous amino acid insertions and deletions (indels). Indels seem to have a selective advantage as the proportions of sequences with indels were steadily increasing over time, currently at over 89%, with similar trends across countries/variants. There were as many as 420 unique indel positions and 447 unique combinations of indels. Despite their high frequency, indels resulted in only minimal alteration, including both gain and loss, of N-glycosylation sites. As indels and point mutations are positively correlated and sequences with indels have significantly more point mutations, they have implications in the context of evolutionary dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.","Rao, R.

Accordingly, it is necessary to identify the risk factors for death in patients with cancer and COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase Ovid databases were searched for relevant articles published before July 31st, 2020. Studies that explored the risk factors for mortality were included. The effect size was relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: We included 17 observational studies involving 3268 patients. The pooled mortality was 24.8%. Male gender, age above 65 years, and comorbidities (especially hypertension and COPD) were risk factors for death (RR 1.16, 1.27, 1.12; 95% CI 0.7-1.95, 1.08-1.49, 1.04-1.2; P = 0.006, 0.004, and 0.002, respectively). Recent anti-cancer treatments did not increase mortality (P > 0.05). Dyspnea, cough, and sputum canused an elevated risk of death (P < 0.05). Antibiotics, glucocorticoids, interferons, invasive ventilation, and complications were associated with a high probability of death (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Various demographic and clinical characteristics, such as male gender, advanced age, comorbidities, and symptoms, were risk factors for mortality in patients with cancer and COVID-19. Our findings suggest recent anti-cancer treatments do not increase mortality.","Liu, Yang; Lu, Huan; Wang, Wei; Liu, Qi; Zhu, Changju",Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,225,1

This poses a serious challenge to clinical diagnosis, laboratory testing, and infection control programs. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of the Hologic Panther Fusion Respiratory Assays (RA) compared to the GenMark ePlex Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) and to assess the ability of the Panther Fusion to perform parallel testing of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses from a single sample. STUDY DESIGN: A diagnostic comparison study was carried out using 375 clinical nasopharyngeal specimens. Assay performance was assessed by overall, positive, and negative percent agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficient. RESULTS: Overall agreement between the Fusion RA and ePlex RPP was 97.3 % (95 % CI 96.3-98.0), positive percent agreement was 97.2 % (95 % CI 93.0-99.2), negative percent agreement was 97.3 % (95 % CI 96.3-98.0), and the kappa coefficient was 0.85 (95 % CI 0.81-0.89). Forty additional viruses in 30 specimens were detected by Fusion that were not detected by ePlex. The maximum specimen throughput for parallel testing of the Fusion Respiratory Assays with SARS-CoV-2 was 275 samples in 20.7 h for Fusion SARS-CoV-2 and 350 samples in 20.0 h for Aptima Transcription Mediated Amplification SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Fusion RA demonstrated substantial agreement compared to the ePlex RPP. However, the Fusion detected respiratory viruses not identified by ePlex, consistent with higher clinical sensitivity.

The COVID-19 pandemic situation has brought this vulnerable population into renewed focus. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to conduct a timely assessment of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of college students. METHODS: We conducted interview surveys with 195 students at a large public university in the United States to understand the effects of the pandemic on their mental health and well-being. The data were analyzed through quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS: Of the 195 students, 138 (71%) indicated increased stress and anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple stressors were identified that contributed to the increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive thoughts among students. These included fear and worry about their own health and of their loved ones (177/195, 91% reported negative impacts of the pandemic), difficulty in concentrating (173/195, 89%), disruptions to sleeping patterns (168/195, 86%), decreased social interactions due to physical distancing (167/195, 86%), and increased concerns on academic performance (159/195, 82%). To cope with stress and anxiety, participants have sought support from others and helped themselves by adopting either negative or positive coping mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the long-lasting pandemic situation and onerous measures such as lockdown and stay-at-home orders, the COVID-19 pandemic brings negative impacts on higher education.

We aimed to evaluate COVID-19 and sickle cell disease (SCD)-related experiences, and the clinical course during the outbreak, to measure anxiety levels of adolescent and young adult patients with homozygous SCD, to analyze the correlations between their COVID-19 experiences and anxiety levels and painful episodes. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 47 patients aged between 14 and 24 years responded to a descriptive instrument and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Clinical features requiring hospitalization for the same period (between March 10 and May 10) of two sequential years were compared. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of the patients had at least one negative COVID-19 experience of dizziness, sleep disturbance, tonic immobility, appetite loss or nausea/abdominal distress. The number of negative COVID-19 experiences was correlated with the state anxiety score, the trait anxiety score, and the number of painful episodes (&#961;=0.552, P<0.001; &#961;=0.529, P<0.001; &#961;=0.448, P=0.002, respectively). Both median state anxiety and trait anxiety scores were below the cut-off scores indicating significant clinical symptoms. The number of hospitalizations requiring vaso-occlusive crisis management and blood/exchange transfusion were similar for the same period of two sequential years, 2019 and 2020. CONCLUSION: These descriptive and correlation findings are the first reported on COVID-19-related anxiety in SCD patients. To develop screening and support strategies for mental health needs in pandemic times, further SCD studies should be conducted.","Tezol, O; Unal, S",Arch Pediatr,225,1

In this work, mathematical models are used to reproduce data of the early evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak in Germany, taking into account the effect of actual and hypothetical non-pharmaceutical interventions. Systems of differential equations of SEIR type are extended to account for undetected infections, stages of infection, and age groups. The models are calibrated on data until April 5. Data from April 6 to 14 are used for model validation. We simulate different possible strategies for the mitigation of the current outbreak, slowing down the spread of the virus and thus reducing the peak in daily diagnosed cases, the demand for hospitalization or intensive care units admissions, and eventually the number of fatalities. Our results suggest that a partial (and gradual) lifting of introduced control measures could soon be possible if accompanied by further increased testing activity, strict isolation of detected cases, and reduced contact to risk groups.","Barbarossa, Maria Vittoria; Fuhrmann, Jan; Meinke, Jan H; Krieg, Stefan; Varma, Hridya Vinod; Castelletti, Noemi; Lippert, Thomas",PLoS One,225,1

We describe the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and characteristics of COVID-19 cases and clusters before the characterisation of COVID-19 as a pandemic. METHODS: Cases of COVID-19 reported between Dec 31, 2019, and March 10, 2020 (ie, the prepandemic period), were identified daily from official websites, press releases, press conference transcripts, and social media feeds of national ministries of health or other government agencies. Case characteristics, travel history, and exposures to other cases were abstracted. Countries with at least one case were classified as affected. Early cases were defined as those among the first 100 cases reported from each country. Later cases were defined as those after the first 100 cases. We analysed reported travel to affected countries among the first case reported from each country outside mainland China, demographic and exposure characteristics among cases with age or sex information, and cluster frequencies and sizes by transmission settings. FINDINGS: Among the first case reported from each of 99 affected countries outside of mainland China, 75 (76%) had recent travel to affected countries; 60 (61%) had travelled to China, Italy, or Iran. Among 1200 cases with age or sex information, 874 (73%) were early cases. Among 762 early cases with age information, the median age was 51 years (IQR 35-63); 25 (3%) of 762 early cases occurred in children younger than 18 years. Overall, 21 (2%) of 1200 cases were in health-care workers and none were in pregnant women. 101 clusters were identified, of which the most commonly identified transmission setting was households (76 [75%]; mean 2·6 cases per cluster [range 2-7]), followed by non-health-care occupational settings (14 [14%]; mean 4·3 cases per cluster [2-14]), and community gatherings (11 [11%]; mean 14·2 cases per cluster [4-36]). INTERPRETATION: Cases with travel links to China, Italy, or Iran accounted for almost two-thirds of the first reported COVID-19 cases from affected countries. Among cases with age information available, most were among adults aged 18 years and older. Although there were many clusters of household transmission among early cases, clusters in occupational or community settings tended to be larger, supporting a possible role for physical distancing to slow the progression of SARS-CoV-2 spread.

The pandemic may increase the rate of intercurrent events (ICEs) and missing values, spurring a great deal of discussion on amending protocols and statistical analysis plans to address these issues. In this article, we revisit recent research on estimands and handling of missing values, especially the ICH E9 (R1) Addendum on Estimands and Sensitivity Analysis in Clinical Trials. Based on an in-depth discussion of the strategies for handling ICEs using a causal inference framework, we suggest some improvements in applying the estimand and estimation framework in ICH E9 (R1). Specifically, we discuss a mix of strategies allowing us to handle ICEs differentially based on reasons for ICEs. We also suggest ICEs should be handled primarily by hypothetical strategies and provide examples of different hypothetical strategies for different types of ICEs as well as a road map for estimation and sensitivity analyses. We conclude that the proposed framework helps streamline translating clinical objectives into targets of statistical inference and automatically resolves many issues with defining estimands and choosing estimation procedures arising from events such as the pandemic.","Qu, Yongming; Lipkovich, Ilya",Ther. innov. regul. sci.

In this study, we surveyed 2,776 students from nine different countries about changes in their university curricula and potential alterations in their daily habits, physical health, and psychological status. We found negative changes across all countries studied, in multiple categories. We found that 99% of respondents indicated changes in their instruction delivery system, with 90% stating a transition to online education, and 93% stating a reduction or suspension of their practical activities. On average, students spent 8.7 hours a day in front of a screen, with significant differences among countries. Students reported worsened studying, sleeping, and eating habits with substantial differences in Latin American countries. Finally, the participants frequently expressed onset and increase in both mental and physical health symptoms: backache, asthenopia, irritability, and emotional instability.

An email survey administered to Iowa State University students between the ages of 18 and 30 who physically attended campus prior to its closure produced 1434 responses. Students living with a parent or guardian increased by 44% and were less likely to experience food insecurity or less likely to work. They had lower stress and ate more home-cooked meals. Students living on their own had higher rates of food insecurity, greater stress, poorer health status, higher cooking self-efficacy, and worked more hours. Seventeen percent of all students were food insecure; related factors were non-White ethnicity, lower cooking self-efficacy, undergraduate status, receipt of financial aid, employment, stress, living in the same situation as before the campus closure, and consumption of more take-out or fast food. These individuals had more barriers to food access.

Epidemiological data suggest that the severity of COVID-19, in particular its case fatality rate, rises strongly with age. It is possible that neither a vaccine nor an effective treatment will be available for >1 year. Thus, it may be necessary for older adults to protect themselves by avoiding direct social contact and practicing social distancing for a rather long period of time. This may result in loneliness and social isolation because, for example, grandchildren cannot visit their grandparents. In turn, both loneliness and social isolation can have serious deleterious consequences (e.g., in terms of morbidity and mortality). Thus, the question arises: are there ways to mitigate loneliness and social isolation? One way to stay in contact is to use online social media such as Facebook or using video calling software such as Skype. However, there are very few studies examining whether the use of online social media or video chats are associated with loneliness and social isolation in older adults. We sum up some preliminary findings and make a call for further research on the link between online social media use/video chat and loneliness, as well as social isolation, in older adults.","Hajek, André; König, Hans-Helmut",Gerontology,225,29

METHODS: A mixed method cross-sectional survey was conducted, seeking the views and experiences of orthopaedic and musculoskeletal medically qualified and Allied Health Professionals in the United Kingdom. Descriptive statistical analysis was employed for quantitative data and a qualitative content analysis undertaken for qualitative data. Findings were presented in accordance with the four key issues. RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety professionals (206 physiotherapists, 78 medically qualified professionals, 6 'other' therapists) participated in the survey.

Qualitative data provided additional context to support the quantitative findings such as validity of indemnification, accuracy of diagnosis and consent using VC, safeguarding issues; and security and sharing of data. Potential changes to practice have been proposed to address these issues. CONCLUSIONS: VC have been rapidly deployed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic often without clear guidance or consensus on many important issues.

A suspected late manifestation of the disease, paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome - temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS), has been seen in small numbers of children and has a more severe disease course than acute SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic has meant that children around the world have been kept off school, isolated from their extended family and friends and asked to stay inside.

RESULTS: Of the 58 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 36 were hospitalized and 22 were managed at home. The median age was 67 years; 52% of patients were male and 63% were non-White. Hypertension (64%), hyperlipidemia (62%), obesity (37%), diabetes mellitus (28%), chronic kidney disease (24%), and lung disease (21%) were the most common comorbidities. In the total cohort, 14 patients (24%) died. Older age (> 70 years), male sex, cardiovascular risk, and patients not in complete remission (CR) or stringent CR were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with hospitalization. Among hospitalized patients, laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of traditional inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) and a significant (p < 0.05) association between elevated inflammatory markers, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, non-White race, and mortality. Ninety-six percent (22/23) of patients developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at a median of 32 days after initial diagnosis. The median time to PCR negativity was 43 (range 19-68) days from initial positive PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Drug exposure and MM disease status at the time of contracting COVID-19 had no bearing on mortality. Mounting a severe inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 and severe hypogammaglobulinemia was associated with higher mortality. The majority of patients mounted an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. These findings pave a path to the identification of vulnerable MM patients who need early intervention to improve outcomes in future outbreaks of COVID-19.","Wang, Bo; Van Oekelen, Oliver; Mouhieddine, Tarek H; Del Valle, Diane Marie; Richter, Joshua; Cho, Hearn Jay; Richard, Shambavi; Chari, Ajai; Gnjatic, Sacha; Merad, Miriam; Jagannath, Sundar; Parekh, Samir; Madduri, Deepu",J Hematol Oncol,225,19

Emerging findings point to existing disparities in health systems and services being further exacerbated, with marginalized populations and low- and middle-income countries burdened disproportionately. More broadly, there is a need to further understand short- and long-term impacts of bypassed essential services, quality assurance of services, the role of primary health care in the frontline, and the need for additional mechanisms for effective vaccine messaging and uptake during epidemics. The review also highlights how trust-of institutions, of science, and between communities and health systems-remains central to a successful pandemic response. Finally, previous crises had repeatedly foreshadowed the inability of health systems to handle upcoming pandemics, yet the reactive nature of policies and practices compounded by lack of resources, infrastructure, and political will have resulted in the current failed response to COVID-19. There is therefore an urgent need for investments in implementation science and for strategies to bridge this persistent research-practice gap.","Baral, Prativa",Int J Health Serv,225,24

The prevalence of obesity was approximately 13% among world's adult population. Recently, several reports suggested that the interference of gut microbiota composition and function is associated with metabolic disorders, including obesity. Gut microbiota produce a board range of metabolites involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, leading to the alteration in host metabolism. However, systematic evaluation of the relationship between gut microbiota, gut metabolite and host metabolite profiles in obese adults is still lacking. In this study, we used comparative metagenomics and metabolomics analysis to determine the gut microbiota and gut-host metabolite profiles in six normal and obese adults of Chinese origin, respectively. Following the functional and pathway analysis, we aimed to understand the possible impact of gut microbiota on the host metabolites via the change in gut metabolites. The result showed that the change in gut microbiota may result in the modulation of gut metabolites contributing to glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle and homolactic fermentation. Furthermore, integrated metabolomic analysis demonstrated a possible positive correlation of dysregulated metabolites in the gut and host, including l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine, uric acid, kynurenic acid, cholesterol sulfate and glucosamine, which were reported to contribute to metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. The findings of this study provide the possible association between gut microbiota-metabolites and host metabolism in obese adults. The identified metabolite changes could serve as biomarkers for the evaluation of obesity and metabolic disorders.","Li, Rong; Huang, Xue; Liang, Xiao; Su, Min; Lai, Keng Po; Chen, Jian",Brief. bioinform,225,20

Nocturnally active males and females rely on their auditory sense to detect and locate vocally active conspecifics during social behaviors. Previous work showed that the midshipman inner ear saccule and lagena are highly adapted to detect and encode socially relevant acoustic stimuli, but the auditory sensitivity and function of the midshipman utricle remain largely unknown. Here, we characterize the auditory evoked potentials from hair cells in the utricle of non-reproductive type I males and test the hypothesis that the midshipman utricle is sensitive to behaviorally-relevant acoustic stimuli. Hair cell potentials were recorded from the rostral, medial and caudal regions of the utricle in response to pure tone stimuli presented by an underwater speaker. We show that the utricle is highly sensitive to particle motion stimuli produced by an underwater speaker positioned in the horizontal plane. Utricular potentials were recorded across a broad range of frequencies with lowest particle acceleration (dB re: 1 ms-2) thresholds occurring at 105 Hz (lowest frequency tested; mean threshold=-32 dB re: 1 ms-2) and highest thresholds at 605 to 1005 Hz (mean threshold range=-5 to -4 dB re: 1 ms-2). The high gain and broadband frequency sensitivity of the utricle suggests that it likely serves a primary auditory function and is well suited to detect conspecific vocalizations including broadband agonistic signals and the multiharmonic advertisement calls produce by reproductive type I males.","Rogers, Loranzie S; Sisneros, Joseph A",J. exp. biol,225,20

As a result, we identified 26 DEMs in eyes, with 23 higher and 3 lower in the left eyes compared with right eyes; 21 DEMs in lungs, with 15 higher and 6 lower in the left lungs compared with right lungs; and 54 DEMs in testes, with 6 higher and 48 lower in the left testes compared with right testes. Ten microRNAs (miRNAs) were further examined by quantitative PCR assays, and seven of these were confirmed. In addition, correlation analysis was performed between paired organ miRNA expressions and diverse body fluid miRNA expressions. Finally, we explored the functions and networks of DEMs and performed biological process and pathway enrichment analysis of target genes for DEMs, providing insights into the physiological and pathophysiological differences between the two entities of paired organs.","Shi, Jiangcheng; Hu, Chengqing; Zhou, Yuan; Cui, Chunmei; Yang, Jichun; Cui, Qinghua",Mol Ther Nucleic Acids,225,14

Evidence from South Korea,20.21513,1.5901226,2021,"Importance: Accumulating evidence suggests that children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are more likely to manifest mild symptoms and are at a lower risk of developing severe respiratory disease compared with adults. It remains unknown how the immune response in children differs from that of adolescents and adults. Objective: To investigate the association of age with the quantity and quality of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used 31â¯426 SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results from pediatric and adult patients. Data were collected from a New York City hospital from April 9 to August 31, 2020. The semiquantitative immunoglobin (Ig) G levels were compared between 85 pediatric and 3648 adult patients. Further analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles was performed on sera from 126 patients aged 1 to 24 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rates and IgG levels were evaluated in patients from a wide range of age groups (1-102 years). SARS-CoV-2 IgG level, total antibody (TAb) level, surrogate neutralizing antibody (SNAb) activity, and antibody binding avidity were compared between children (aged 1-10 years), adolescents (aged 11-18 years), and young adults (aged 19-24 years). Results: Among 31â¯426 antibody test results (19â¯797 [63.0%] female patients), with 1194 pediatric patients (mean [SD] age, 11.0 [5.3] years) and 30â¯232 adult patients (mean [SD] age, 49.2 [17.1] years), the seroprevalence in the pediatric (197 [16.5%; 95% CI, 14.4%-18.7%]) and adult (5630 [18.6%; 95% CI, 18.2%-19.1%]) patient populations was similar. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG level showed a negative correlation with age in the pediatric population (r = -0.45, P < .001) and a moderate but positive correlation with age in adults (r = 0.24, P < .001). Patients aged 19 to 30 years exhibited the lowest IgG levels (eg, aged 25-30 years vs 1-10 years: 99 [44-180] relative fluorescence units [RFU] vs 443 [188-851] RFU). In the subset cohort aged 1 to 24 years, IgG, TAb, SNAb and avidity were negatively correlated with age (eg, IgG: r = -0.51; P < .001). Children exhibited higher median (IQR) IgG levels, TAb levels, and SNAb activity compared with adolescents (eg, IgG levels: 473 [233-656] RFU vs 191 [82-349] RFU; P < .001) and young adults (eg, IgG levels: 473 [233-656] RFU vs 85 [38-150] RFU; P < .001). Adolescents also exhibited higher median (IQR) TAb levels, IgG levels, and SNAb activity than young adults (eg, TAb levels: 961 [290-2074] RFU vs 370 [125-697]; P = .006). In addition, children had higher antibody binding avidity compared with young adults, but the difference was not significant. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study suggest that SARS-CoV-2 viral specific antibody response profiles are distinct in different age groups. Age-targeted strategies for disease screening and management as well as vaccine development may be warranted.","Yang, He S; Costa, Victoria; Racine-Brzostek, Sabrina E; Acker, Karen P; Yee, Jim; Chen, Zhengming; Karbaschi, Mohsen; Zuk, Robert; Rand, Sophie; Sukhu, Ashley; Klasse, P J; Cushing, Melissa M; Chadburn, Amy; Zhao, Zhen",JAMA Netw Open,225,1

We performed a service evaluation project in NHS Lothian to explore how and why the COVID-19 pandemic and public health advice had affected chest pain presentations and help-seeking behaviour at an individual patient level using a qualitative interview approach. METHODS: We carried out 28 semi-structured telephone interviews with a convenience sample of patients who presented with chest pain during lockdown and in patients with known coronary heart disease under the outpatient care of a cardiologist in April and May 2020. Interviews were audio recorded and voice files listened to while making detailed notes. Salient themes and issues were documented as verbatim extracts. Interviews were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Patient interviews revealed three main themes. 1) pandemic help-seeking behaviour; describing how participants made the decision to seek professional healthcare assessment. 2) COVID-19 exposure concerns; describing how the subthemes of perceived vulnerability, wishing to protect others and adding pressure to the health service shaped their decision making for an episode of acute chest pain. 3) hospital experience; describing the difference between the imagined and actual experience in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative interviews revealed how the pandemic shaped help-seeking practices, how patients interpreted their personal vulnerability to the virus, and described patient experience of attending hospital for assessment during this time. As patient numbers presenting to hospital appeared to mirror public health messaging, dynamic monitoring of this messaging should evaluate public response to healthcare campaigns to ensure the net impact on health, pandemic and non-pandemic related, is optimised.","Ferry, Amy V; Keanie, Collette; Denvir, Martin A; Mills, Nicholas L; Strachan, Fiona E",PLoS One,225,15

After applying a series of inclusive and exclusive criteria, a total of 85 different videos from the United States and Canada were evaluated. More than half (59%) of the videos presented handwashing procedures, less than a third (22%) showed kitchen disinfection, and most (69%) showed concern for ""take-out"" or ""grocery store"" practices. Multiple and different produce washing procedures were also shown throughout videos. Food was not considered hazardous by 33% of the videos, but 20% mentioned that food packaging is potentially hazardous. Most videos cited government agencies and had a host or guest who was a healthcare professional or professor/expert. Of the overall citations, three videos were not aligned with a government agency's guideline or information cited; two were presented by a healthcare professional. These findings demonstrate the need to develop educational interventions that increase YouTube video hosts and guests' awareness of social media use as a tool for food safety dissemination and the need to provide trustworthy sources.","Thomas, Merlyn; Haynes, Peyton; Archila, Juan; Nguyen, Mai; Xu, Wenqing; Feng, Yaohua",J. foof prot,225,24

In the present manuscript, we explored whether HLA class I genotypes can be associated with the critical course of Coronavirus Disease-19 by searching possible connections between genotypes of deceased patients and their age at death. HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genotypes of n = 111 deceased patients with COVID-19 (Moscow, Russia) and n = 428 volunteers were identified with next-generation sequencing. Deceased patients were split into two groups according to age at the time of death: n = 26 adult patients aged below 60 and n = 85 elderly patients over 60. With the use of HLA class I genotypes, we developed a risk score (RS) which was associated with the ability to present severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) peptides by the HLA class I molecule set of an individual. The resulting RS was significantly higher in the group of deceased adults compared to elderly adults [p = 0.00348, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC = 0.68)]. In particular, presence of HLA-A*01:01 allele was associated with high risk, while HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*03:01 mainly contributed to low risk. The analysis of patients with homozygosity strongly highlighted these results: homozygosity by HLA-A*01:01 accompanied early deaths, while only one HLA-A*02:01 homozygote died before 60 years of age. Application of the constructed RS model to an independent Spanish patients cohort (n = 45) revealed that the score was also associated with the severity of the disease. The obtained results suggest the important role of HLA class I peptide presentation in the development of a specific immune response to COVID-19.","Shkurnikov, Maxim; Nersisyan, Stepan; Jankevic, Tatjana; Galatenko, Alexei; Gordeev, Ivan; Vechorko, Valery; Tonevitsky, Alexander",Front Immunol,225,16

In a prophetic article, Mark Weiser,1 described such a connection, that it is now known under the term of Internet of Things (IoT). In a broadest sense, the term IoT encompasses everything connected to the internet, but it is increasingly being used to define objects that ""talk"" to each other, creating a network from simple sensors to smartphones and wearables connected. During the recent years this network of communicating devices has been combined with other technological achievements, and particularly with the Virtual Reality (VR)2 and the Artificial Intelligence (AI).3 The emerge of COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, resulted to the poor response and healthcare failures of many countries globally.4 One of the main reasons for such a failure, was the inability of accurate data collection from different sources. Apparently, it was the first time, humanity realized the need for massive amounts of heterogeneous data to be collected, interpreted, and shared. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, several innovators and public authorities are looking to leverage IoT tools to reduce the burden on the healthcare systems.5 Mental health is one of the areas that seems to benefit the most of such technologies. A significant decrease of the total amount of ER visits and a dramatic increase of internet access from the patients and care givers along to the development of applications for mental health issues, followed the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.6 Such technologies proved to be efficient to help mentally ill patients and pioneer the path in the future. Probably the most obvious use of these emerged technologies is the improvement of the telehealth options. Patients who suffer from mental illness face significant problems towards the continuity of care during the crisis.7 Nonetheless, they usually have other health problems, that deprive them from an equitable health care provision. Improved telehealth platforms can give them a single point access to address all their problems. The use of electronic health records can reduce the fragmentary health services and improve the outcome.8 However, this is only the beginning. The COVID-19 crisis and the subsequent social isolation, to reduce both the contamination and the spread of the disease, highlighted the necessity for providing accurate and secure diagnoses and treatments from a safe distance. Virtual reality combined with IoT and AI technologies seem to be a reliable alternative to the classic physical and mental examination and treatment in many areas of mental and neurological diseases.2 These novel techniques can spot the early signs and detect mental illnesses with high accuracy. However, caution and more work are required to bridge the space between these recently thrived technologies and mental health care.7 It is worth mentioning, that internet-oriented health care procedures can also help to reduce the gaps caused by the stigma of mental illness. For example, the development of AI chatbots (an application used to chat directly with a human) can alleviate the fears of judgment of the help seeking persons and provide the professionals with a supplemental support toward improved services to their patients.9 A final remark for conclusion. Humanity is more and more depended to the ""intelligent"" machines. However, we must not forget that we humans are responsible to set the rules of such co-existence.","Alevizopoulos, Aristomenis; Kritikos, Jacob; Alevizopoulos, Georgios",Psychiatriki,225,7

Zoonoses are the commonest source of emerging human infections and inter-species transmission is facilitated by anthropogenic factors such as encroachment and destruction of wilderness areas, wildlife trafficking and climate change. South Africa was selected for a 'One Health' study to identify research priorities for control of zoonoses due to its complex disease burden and an overstretched health system. METHODS: A multidisciplinary group of 18 experts identified priority zoonotic diseases, knowledge gaps and proposed research priorities for the next 5 y. Each priority was scored using predefined criteria by another group of five experts and then weighted by a reference group (n=28) and the 18 experts. RESULTS: Seventeen diseases were mentioned with the top five being rabies (14/18), TB (13/18), brucellosis (11/18), Rift Valley fever (9/11) and cysticercosis (6/18). In total, 97 specific research priorities were listed, with the majority on basic epidemiological research (n=57), such as measuring the burden of various zoonoses (n=24), followed by 20 on development of new interventions. The highest research priority score was for improving existing interventions (0.77/1.0), followed by health policy and systems research (0.72/1.0). CONCLUSION: Future zoonotic research should improve understanding of zoonotic burden and risk factors and new interventions in public health. People with limited rural services, immunocompromised, in informal settlements and high-risk occupations, should be the highest research priority.","Simpson, Greg; Quesada, Fabiola; Chatterjee, Pranab; Kakkar, Manish; Chersich, Matthew F; Thys, Séverine",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,225,16

The most common symptoms leading to the presentation were high fever &#8805;103°F (90%), cough (80%) and dyspnea (70%), followed by fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms (both 30%), myalgia, loss of taste, pleuritic chest pain, and confusion (all 10%). All patients had bilateral infiltrates on chest X-rays suggestive of interstitial viral pneumonia. All patients were cannulated in the venovenous configuration. Two (20%) patients were successfully liberated from ECMO support after 7 and 10 days, respectively, and one (10%) patient is currently on a weaning course. One patient (10%) died after 9 days on ECMO from multiorgan dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary multi-institutional data from a statewide collaborative offer insight into the clinical characteristics of the first 10 patients requiring ECMO for COVID-19 and their initial clinical course. Greater morbidity and mortality is likely to be seen in these critically ill patients with longer follow-up.","Sultan, Ibrahim; Habertheuer, Andreas; Usman, Asad A; Kilic, Arman; Gnall, Eric; Friscia, Michael E; Zubkus, Dmitriy; Hirose, Hitoshi; Sanchez, Pablo; Okusanya, Olugbenga; Szeto, Wilson Y; Gutsche, Jacob",J Card Surg,225,1

These severe COVID-19 patients are characterized by high ferritin levels. These findings mirror what was previously reported about the prognostic role of this iron storage protein in other inflammatory diseases included in the hyperferritinemic syndrome. The latter suggests that ferritin could be a further pathogenic mediator in enhancing the inflammatory process, stimulating inflammatory pathways, and thus perpetuating a vicious pathogenic loop. Considering its activity as an immune activator, a therapeutic approach targeting ferritin may be also postulated in these diseases. Considering these observations, high ferritin levels characterize severe COVID-19 and other diseases included in the hyperferritinemic syndrome. Because ferritin could enhance the inflammatory process, it could be tested as a possible new therapeutic target to improve the outcome of these patients.","Ruscitti, Piero; Giacomelli, Roberto",Isr Med Assoc J,225,16

METHODS: An analysis of prospectively collected registry data of all ED intubations over a 3-year period at an Australian Major Trauma Centre. During the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, we introduced modifications to standard practice to reduce the risk to staff including: aerosolisation reduction, comprehensive personal protective equipment for all intubations, regular low fidelity simulation with 'sign-off' for all medical and nursing staff, senior clinician laryngoscopist and the introduction of pre-drawn medications. RESULTS: There were 783 patients, 136 in the COVID-19 era and 647 in the pre-COVID-19 comparator group. The rate of hypoxia was higher during the COVID-19 era compared to pre-COVID-19 (18.4% vs 9.6%, P < 0.005).

We find that mouse ACC exhibits sequence plasticity, but in contrast to V1, the plasticity expresses as a change in response timing, rather than a change in response magnitude. Sequence plasticity is absent in ACC, but not V1, in a mouse model of a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with intellectual disability and autism-like features.

These groups may not benefit from traditional HIV prevention interventions available at the health facilities where they live, but may benefit from services offered at public venues identified as places where people meet new sexual partners (e.g. bars, nightclubs, transportation hubs and guest houses). The goal of this analysis was to estimate availability, access and uptake of prevention services by populations who visit these venues. METHODS: We collected cross-sectional data using the Priorities for Local AIDS Control Efforts sampling method at cross-border locations near or along the land and lake borders of Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda from June 2016-February 2017. This bio-behavioural survey captured information from a probability sample of 11,428 individuals at 833 venues across all areas. Data were weighted using survey sampling weights and analysed using methods to account for the complex sampling design. RESULTS: Among the 85.6% of persons who had access to condoms, 60.5% did not use a condom at their last anal or vaginal sexual encounter. Venues visited by high percentages of persons living with HIV were not more likely than other venues to offer condoms. In 12 of the 22 cross-border areas, male or female condoms were available at less than 33% of the venues visited by persons having difficulty accessing condoms. In 17 of the 22 cross-border areas, education outreach visits in the preceding six months occurred at less than 50% of the venues where participants had low effective use of condoms. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals visiting venues in cross-border areas report poor access to and low effective use of condoms and other prevention services. Availability of HIV prevention services differed by venue and population type and cross-border area, suggesting opportunities for more granular targeting of HIV prevention interventions and transnational coordination of HIV programming.","Virkud, Arti V; Arimi, Peter; Ssengooba, Freddie; Mulholland, Grace E; Herce, Michael E; Markiewicz, Milissa; Weir, Sharon; Edwards, Jessie K",J Int AIDS Soc,225,22

In this paper, we propose to utilize continuous body temperature time series of patients that developed a fever, in order to apply a method capable of diagnosing the specific underlying fever cause only by means of a pattern relative frequency analysis. This analysis was based on a recently proposed measure, Slope Entropy, applied to a variety of records coming from dengue and malaria patients, among other fever diseases. After an input parameter customization, a classification analysis of malaria and dengue records took place, quantified by the Matthews Correlation Coefficient. This classification yielded a high accuracy, with more than 90% of the records correctly labelled in some cases, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach proposed. This approach, after further studies, or combined with more measures such as Sample Entropy, is certainly very promising in becoming an early diagnosis tool based solely on body temperature temporal patterns, which is of great interest in the current Covid-19 pandemic scenario.","Cuesta-Frau, David; Dakappa, Pradeepa H; Mahabala, Chakrapani; Gupta, Arjun R",,225,16

We show that in the case of $n$ items among which $k$ are defective, the smallest possible number of tests equals $\min\{ C_{k,n} k \log n, n\}$ up to lower-order asymptotic terms, where $C_{k,n}$ is a uniformly bounded constant (varying depending on the scaling of $k$ with respect to $n$) with a simple explicit expression. The algorithmic upper bound follows from a minor adaptation of an existing analysis of the Definite Defectives (DD) algorithm, and the algorithm-independent lower bound builds on existing works for the regimes $k \le n^{1-\Omega(1)}$ and $k = \Theta(n)$. In sufficiently sparse regimes (including $k = o\big( \frac{n}{\log n} \big)$), our main result generalizes that of Coja-Oghlan {\em et al.} (2020) by avoiding the assumption $k \le n^{1-\Omega(1)}$, whereas in sufficiently dense regimes (including $k = \omega\big( \frac{n}{\log n} \big)$), our main result shows that individual testing is asymptotically optimal for any non-zero target success probability, thus strengthening an existing result of Aldridge (2019) in terms of both the error probability and the assumed scaling of $k$.","Bay, Wei Heng; Price, Eric; Scarlett, Jonathan",,225,16

Its use has not been validated in neonatal models. OBJECTIVES: We compared an in vivo lung ultrasound score against clinical and histological markers of acute lung injury, in a neonatal animal model, hypothesizing that POCUS would sensitively diagnose early acute lung injury in neonates and discern its severity. METHODS: Fifteen anesthetized, ventilated 3-day-old neonatal piglets were divided into controls, moderate lung injury, or severe lung injury by graded treatment with oleic acid. Degree of lung injury was quantified at baseline, immediately after oleic acid administration, and 1 hour after the evolution of acute lung injury, by blood gases, ventilation parameters and calculated oxygenation deficit; hemodynamic indices by echocardiography, and lung ultrasound obtained in an 8-region grid of anterior and posterior zones, semi-quantitatively analyzed by a blinded observer. Lungs were inflation-fixed postmortem at last mean airway pressure, for histological assessment. RESULTS: Acute lung injury manifested in oleic acid-treated groups as dose-dependent capillary leak causing intravascular depletion and cardiac failure, hypoxemia with increasing intrapulmonary shunt fraction, decreased lung compliance, and resistance. Ultrasound scores of anterior regions distinguished moderate from severe injury; scores in posterior regions reached maximum values immediately after lung injury. POCUS score correlated with calculated intrapulmonary shunt fraction (R2 = .65) and with histological injury score (R2 = .61), P < .01. CONCLUSION: We conclude that POCUS may be valuable in neonates for early quantification of acute lung injury or ARDS; and that nondependent ultrasound regions clearly distinguish severity of pulmonary edema.","Elsayed, Yasser N; Hinton, Martha; Graham, Ruth; Dakshinamurti, Shyamala",Pediatr. pulmonol,225,16

Techniques for reducing aerosolization and risk of transmission of COVID-19 during these procedures would be valuable to the neurosurgical community. The authors aimed to simulate the generation of small-particle aerosols during EES and craniectomy in order to develop methods to reduce the spread of aerosolized particles, and to test the effectiveness of these methods. METHODS: This study was performed at the Anatomical Laboratory for Visuospatial Innovations in Otolaryngology and Neurosurgery at The Ohio State University. The following two scenarios were used to measure three different particle sizes (0.3, 2.5, and 10 µm) generated: 1) drilling frontotemporal bone, simulating a craniectomy; and 2) drilling sphenoid bone, simulating an endonasal approach. A suction mask device was created with the aim of reducing particle release. The presence of particles was measured without suction, with a single Frazier tip suction in the field, and with the suction mask device in addition to the Frazier suction tip. Particles were measured 12 cm from the craniectomy or endonasal drilling region. RESULTS: In the absence of any aerosol-reducing devices, the number of particles measured during craniectomy was significantly higher than that generated by endonasal drilling. This was true regardless of the particle size measured (0.3 µm, p < 0.001; 2.5 µm, p < 0.001; and 10 µm, p < 0.001). The suction mask device reduced the release of particles of all sizes measured in the craniectomy simulation (0.3 µm, p < 0.001; 2.5 µm, p < 0.001; and 10 µm, p < 0.001) and particles of 0.3 µm and 2.5 µm in the single Frazier suction simulation (0.3 µm, p = 0.031; and 2.5 µm, p = 0.026). The suction mask device further reduced the release of particles of all sizes during EES simulation (0.3 µm, p < 0.001; and 2.5 µm, p < 0.001) and particles of 0.3 µm and 2.5 µm in the single Frazier suction simulation (0.3 µm, p = 0.033; and 2.5 µm, p = 0.048). Large particles (10 µm) were not detected during EES. CONCLUSIONS: The suction mask device is a simple and effective means of reducing aerosol release during EES, and it could potentially be used during mastoidectomies.

Diagnosing IV can be challenging, because its clinical features are subject to great variation, ranging from mild cases with slight xerosis to severe cases with marked scaling and formation of fissures. In this review, IV and its most relevant differential diagnoses, X-linked ichthyosis, autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis and acquired ichthyosis are reviewed.","Dorf, Inger Lily; Sommerlund, Mette; Koppelhus, Uffe",Ugeskr. laeg,225,20

Consequently, the pollution of the soil with potentially toxic elements (PTEs) is of great concern to humanity. The objective of this study is to investigate the source apportionment, concentration levels and spatial distribution of PTEs in selected soils in Frýdek-Místek District of the Czech Republic. The total number of soil samples was 70 (topsoil 49 and 21 subsoils) and was analysed using a portable XRF machine. Contamination factor and the pollution index load were used for the assessment and interpreting the pollution and distribution of PTEs in the soils. The inverse distance weighting was used for the spatial evaluation of the PTEs. The results of the analysis showed that the area is composed of low-to-high pollution site. PTEs displayed spatial variation patterns. The average PTE concentration decreases in this Fe > Ti > Ba > Zr > Rb > Sr > Cr > Y>Cu > Ni > Th order for the topsoil and also decreases in this Fe > Ti > Zr > Ba > Rb > Sr > Cr > Y > Cu > Ni > and Th order for the subsoil. These PTEs Cr, Ni, Cu, Rb, Y, Zr, Ba, Th, and Fe were far above the baseline European average value and the World average value level, respectively. The source apportionment showed the dominance of Cr, Ni, Rb, Ti, Th, Zr, Cu, Fe in the topsoil, while the subsoil was dominated by all the PTEs (factor 1 to 6) except Ba. The study concludes that indiscriminate human activities have an enormous effect on soil pollution.","Agyeman, Prince Chapman; Ahado, Samuel Kudjo; Kingsley, John; Kebonye, Ndiye Michael; Biney, James Kobina Mensah; Boruvka, Lubos; Vasat, Radim; Kocarek, Martin",,225,10

In order to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) goal 4, that is, to ensure quality education for all, to make educational resources and online learning are indispensable, and to access these resources anytime, anywhere through the Internet. In addition, the global pandemic of COVID-19 has made online education more necessary than ever before. Where and how ICT is used may have an impact on the components of motivation, such as self-efficacy and persistence. In this study, we quantified the impact of ICT utilization on the two components of self-efficacy and persistence. The effects of ICT use on both components were analyzed from the data taken from the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) administered to 15-year old students. The results revealed that students who frequently utilized ICT for the purpose of out-of-school learning, particularly for activities related to school projects, exhibited significantly higher levels of self-efficacy and persistence. The frequency of ICT usage for in-school learning revealed no effect on any of the two above components. In addition, utilization of ICT for recreational purposes outside of school showed significantly lower values in the area of persistence. These results indicate that it is important to set tasks that provide a continuum of ICT use, both in and out of school, in order to motivate learners. This has important implications for the design of learning in online education. Furthermore, it suggests that teachers should design exploratory type lessons that focus on strengthening students' desire to learn outside of class.","Hori, R.; Fujii, M.",Sustainability,225,15

General practitioner (GP) registrars are now routinely conducting many MSK consultations remotely;however, very little is known of their level of confidence and satisfaction regarding this new and evolving scenario, or how this may impact patient management of patients. In this study, we aimed to understand GP registrars' level of confidence and satisfaction with respect to remote MSK consultations, and the perceived impact on patient management. Study design This study involved a cross-sectional online survey of GP registrars in the West Midlands, which was conducted in January 2021. Methods The survey asked for ranked responses to questions comparing face-to-face consulting methods with remote consulting, focusing on confidence, satisfaction, onward investigations, and referral activity. Statistical analysis was performed using the R software version 4.0. Results The overall survey response was 21.2% (n-312/1,471). Of the respondents, 85.9% of GP registrars had not received any training to prepare them for remote MSK consultations. GP registrars generally felt that they were more confident when treating patients face-to-face compared to remote consultations (p&lt;0.001). This was true for general MSK complaints as well as specific assessments of the hand, shoulder, spine, hip, knee, and ankle;36.2% of GP registrars were not satisfied and 51.0% thought that their patients were not satisfied with the current quality of remote MSK consultations. Of note, 77.6% of GP registrars said that they were more likely to request additional investigations, and 75.6% stated that they were more likely to refer patients to a specialist after a remote MSK consultation. Conclusion This study highlights the need for further training to better equip primary care doctors for remote MSK consultations. With tailored training, GP registrars could offer more streamlined remote patient care for MSK complaints.","Sahni, M.; Choudhry, J.; Mittal, A.; Bhogal, G.",Cureus,225,24

This unprecedented situation is very challenging for the safety of Health Care Worker. Hence, in this article, we aim to summarize some of the current guidelines as to how to triage patients in need for Trans Catheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI), during this ongoing pandemic, and will address some necessary considerations related to the preparation of catheterization laboratories and personal during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Balghith, Mohammed.A.; Arifi, Ahmed.A.; Ahmed, Dalia.M.; Metwally, A.Mounir",J.

METHODS: This national death registry included all adult (aged &#8805;18 years) deaths in England and Wales between January 1, 2014, and June 30, 2020. Daily deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared against the expected daily deaths, estimated with use of the Farrington surveillance algorithm for daily historical data between 2014 and 2020 by place and cause of death. RESULTS: Between March 2 and June 30, 2020, there was an excess mortality of 57,860 (a proportional increase of 35%) compared with the expected deaths, of which 50,603 (87%) were COVID-19 related. At home, only 14% (2267) of the 16,190 excess deaths were related to COVID-19, with 5963 deaths due to cancer and 2485 deaths due to cardiac disease, few of which involved COVID-19. In care homes or hospices, 61% (15,623) of the 25,611 excess deaths were related to COVID-19, 5539 of which were due to respiratory disease, and most of these (4315 deaths) involved COVID-19. In the hospital, there were 16,174 fewer deaths than expected that did not involve COVID-19, with 4088 fewer deaths due to cancer and 1398 fewer deaths due to cardiac disease than expected. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a large excess of deaths in care homes that were poorly characterized and likely to be the result of undiagnosed COVID-19. There was a smaller but important and ongoing excess in deaths at home, particularly from cancer and cardiac disease, suggesting public avoidance of hospital care for non-COVID-19 conditions.","Wu, Jianhua; Mafham, Marion; Mamas, Mamas A; Rashid, Muhammad; Kontopantelis, Evangelos; Deanfield, John E; de Belder, Mark A; Gale, Chris P",Mayo Clin Proc,225,24

Predation risk and wind-induced perturbations in the canopy may further impede the movement process. In the Australian stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum, first-instar nymphs hatch on the forest floor and disperse toward tree canopies in the daytime. Here, we address how their tactic responses to environmental cues and movement strategies are adapted to the canopy environment. Newly hatched nymphs ascend with high endurance, travelling >100 m within 60 minutes. Navigation toward open canopies is underpinned by negative gravitaxis, positive phototaxis, and visual responses to vertically oriented contrast patterns. Nymphal E. tiaratum also use directed jumping to cross gaps, and respond to tactile stimulation and potential threat with a self-dropping reflex, resulting in aerial descent. Post-hatch dispersal in E. tiaratum thus consists of visually mediated displacement both on vegetational structures and in the air; within the latter context, gliding is then an effective mechanism enabling recovery after predator- and perturbation-induced descent. These results further support the importance of a diurnal niche, in addition to the arboreal spatial niche, in the evolution of gliding in wingless arboreal invertebrates.","Zeng, Yu; Chang, Sofia W; Williams, Janelle Y; Nguyen, Lynn Y-Nhi; Tang, Jia; Naing, Grisanu; Kazi, Chandni; Dudley, Robert",J. exp. biol,225,6

Such development is important, for example, in the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in which covalent inhibitors can provide a promising tool for blocking Mpro, the main protease of the virus. This work develops a reliable and practical protocol for evaluating the binding free energy of covalent inhibitors. Our protocol presents a major advance over other approaches that do not consider the chemical contribution of the binding free energy. Our strategy combines the empirical valence bond method for evaluating the reaction energy profile and the PDLD/S-LRA/ß method for evaluating the noncovalent part of the binding process. This protocol has been used in the calculations of the binding free energy of an &#945;-ketoamide inhibitor of Mpro. Encouragingly, our approach reproduces the observed binding free energy. Our study of covalent inhibitors of cysteine proteases indicates that in the choice of an effective warhead it is crucial to focus on the exothermicity of the point on the free energy surface of a peptide cleavage that connects the acylation and deacylation steps. Overall, we believe that our approach should provide a powerful and effective method for in silico design of covalent drugs.","Mondal, Dibyendu; Warshel, Arieh",Biochemistry,225,1

Vesículas secretadas por células, proteínas e miRNAs associados à competência oocitária em bovinos: um modelo retrospectivo no microambiente folicular. 2018. 175f. Tese (Doutorado) Faculdade de Zootecnia e Engenharia de Alimentos, Universidade de São Paulo, Pirassununga, 2017. A produção in vitro de embriões é uma biotecnologia bastante difundida mundialmente. O Brasil, em 2015, foi responsável por aproximadamente 67% dos embriões bovinos produzidos in vitro no mundo (PERRY, 2014). Embora essa tecnologia seja bastante utilizada, é de grande interesse para o mercado desenvolver estratégias que levem ao maior aproveitamento dos oócitos obtidos e compreender os mecanismos, dentro do ambiente folicular, que determinam a competência oocitária. O microambiente folicular é fundamental para o crescimento e a aquisição da competência oocitária, tornando o oócito apto a desenvolver-se e manter o embrião até a transição materno embrionária. Para tanto, os componentes foliculares células da granulosa, células do cumulus, oócito e líquido folicular precisam trabalhar em unidade, visto que possuem uma relação de interdependência. Dentro dos mecanismos de comunicação existentes no ambiente folicular estão as vesículas secretadas por células, chamadas vesículas extracelulares, que foram descritas no líquido folicular, contendo material bioativo como proteínas, lipídios e RNAs, incluindo os microRNAs. Contudo, os componentes do ambiente folicular podem refletir na qualidade do oócito que será produzido e a hipótese geral deste trabalho é de que os miRNAs presentes no ambiente folicular regulam vias de sinalização importantes para o desenvolvimento oocitário e que os miRNAs e ou RNAs mensageiros presentes nas células foliculares podem ser explorados como importantes ferramentas para o diagnóstico da qualidade oocitária. O primeiro estudo determinou perfis transcricionais de miRNAs em células da granulosa, em complexos cumulus-oócito e em vesículas extracelulares derivadas destas células e também do fluido folicular. Além de conhecer a origem e o papel dos miRNAs no ambiente folicular, estes perfis de expressão indicaram a regulação no ambiente folicular da via de sinalização da PI3K-Akt. No segundo estudo, componentes desta via de sinalização foram então determinados em células foliculares associadas a oócitos de alta ou baixa competência ao desenvolvimento. Os resultados demonstram que a ativação da via PI3K-Akt em células foliculares correlaciona-se à maior competência oocitária; de modo oposto, a menor atividade desta via nas células foliculares está relacionada à reduzida competência oocitária. Nos estudos três e quatro, um conjunto de experimentos foram realizados para determinar o perfil de microRNAs e RNAs mensageiros em células do cumulus associadas a oócitos de alta ou baixa competência ao desenvolvimento. Buscou-se esclarecer alguns dos mecanismos responsáveis pela melhor qualidade oocitária e levar a identificação de biomarcadores de qualidade oocitária permitindo o avanço e o desenvolvimento de novas ferramentas para intensificar a produção in vitro de embriões bovinos. Por fim, estes resultados demonstram respostas integradas entre oócitos e células foliculares durante o desenvolvimento folicular e o processo de aquisição de competência oocitária e identificaram marcadores de qualidade oocitária.","ANDRADE, GABRIELLA MAMEDE",,225,2

Willow bark (Salix cortex) has been used for centuries to relieve pain, inflammation, and fever. Its main active ingredient, salicin, is metabolized in the human body into salicylic acid, the precursor of the commonly used pain drug acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Here, we report on the in vitro anti-inflammatory efficacy of two methanolic Salix extracts, standardized to phenolic compounds, in comparison to ASA in the context of a SARS-CoV-2 peptide challenge. Using SARS-CoV-2 peptide/IL-1ß- or LPS-activated human PBMCs and an inflammatory intestinal Caco-2/HT29-MTX co-culture, Salix extracts, and ASA concentration-dependently suppressed prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a principal mediator of inflammation. The inhibition of COX-2 enzyme activity, but not protein expression was observed for ASA and one Salix extract. In activated PBMCs, the suppression of relevant cytokines (i.e., IL-6, IL-1ß, and IL-10) was seen for both Salix extracts. The anti-inflammatory capacity of Salix extracts was still retained after transepithelial passage and liver cell metabolism in an advanced co-culture model system consisting of intestinal Caco-2/HT29-MTX cells and differentiated hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, cataract surgery was the most commonly performed operation by the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety of elective cataract surgery performed in the United Kingdom in a COVID-19 free hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Single centre prospective observational cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing elective cataract surgery in the United Kingdom over a 3 month period from May to August 2020. Electronic medical records were reviewed and patients were contacted at 30 days post-operatively. Data collection included symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection, hospital admission, mortality, intra-operative and post-operative surgical complications. RESULTS: A total of 649 elective cataract surgeries were performed. Two patients (0.3%) developed worsening dyspnoea during the 30 day post-operative period, but tested negative for COVID-19 infection. Three patients (0.5%) were hospitalised, unrelated to COVID-19 infection, of which one patient (0.2%) passed.

Though it is difficult to maintain strong network connections between vehicles because of there high mobility, with the help of cooperative communication, it is possible to increase the communication efficiency, minimise delay, packet loss, and Packet Dropping Rate (PDR). However, cooperating with unknown or unauthorized vehicles could result in information theft, privacy leakage, vulnerable to different security attacks, etc. In this paper, a blockchain based secure and privacy preserving authentication protocol is proposed for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Blockchain is utilized to store and manage the authentication information in a distributed and decentralized environment and developed on the Ethereum platform that uses a digital signature algorithm to ensure confidentiality, non-repudiation, integrity, and preserving the privacy of the IoVs. For optimized communication, transmitted services are categorized into emergency and optional services. Similarly, to optimize the performance of the authentication process, IoVs are categorized as emergency and general IoVs. The proposed cooperative protocol is validated by numerical analyses which show that the protocol successfully increases the system throughput and decreases PDR and delay. On the other hand, the authentication protocol requires minimum storage as well as generates low computational overhead that is suitable for the IoVs with limited computer resources.","Akhter, A F M Suaib; Ahmed, Mohiuddin; Shah, A F M Shahen; Anwar, Adnan; Kayes, A S M; Zengin, Ahmet",Sensors (Basel),225,24

However, there is little evidence about how new mothers in Canada access and use online resources. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine how first-time mothers accessed information and support both online and off-line during the first six months postpartum and how their experiences were constructed through social and institutional discourses. METHODS: A qualitative feminist poststructuralist approach was used to analyze an online discussion board with first-time mothers in Nova Scotia. RESULTS: Mothers who used the online discussion board experienced a sense of community with other mothers where empathy and encouragement were integral to the ways in which information and support were shared. ""Weak ties"" (with strangers) were important and led to the following themes: (a) empathy, encouragement, and information; (b) socialization; (c) blurring the boundaries of online and off-line networks; and (d) Developing community. CONCLUSIONS: These online forums offer insight for health professionals looking to improve mothers' care postpartum and point to a need to foster spaces for new mothers to talk to each other.","Aston, Megan; Price, Sheri; Hunter, Andrea; Sim, Meaghan; Etowa, Josephine; Monaghan, Joelle; Paynter, Martha",Can J Nurs Res,225,1

Very little structural information about 2019-nCoV make this situation more difficult for drug designing. Benzylidenechromanones, naturally occurring oxygen heterocyclic compounds, having capability to inhibit various protein and receptors, have been designed here to block mutant variety of coronavirus main protease enzyme (SARC-CoV-2 Mpro) isolated from 2019-nCoV with the assistance of molecular docking, bioinformatics and molecular electrostatic potential. (Z)-3-(4'-chlorobenzylidene)-thiochroman-4-one showed highest binding affinity to the protein. Binding of a compound to this protein actually inhibits the replication and transcription of the virus and, ultimately, stop the virus multiplication. Incorporation of any functional groups to the basic benzylidenechromanones enhances their binding ability. Chloro and bromo substitutions amplify the binding affinity. ADME studies of all these compounds indicate they are lipophilic, high gastro intestine absorbable and blood-brain barrier permeable. The outcome reveals that the investigated benzylidenechromanones can be examined in the case of 2019-nCoV as potent inhibitory drug of SARC-CoV-2 Mpro, for their strong inhibition ability, high reactivity and effective pharmacological properties.","Sepay, Nayim; Sepay, Nadir; Al Hoque, Ashique; Mondal, Rina; Halder, Umesh Chandra; Muddassir, Mohd",Struct Chem,225,1

In this review, using Tanzania as a case, we examine the impacts and risks that wildlife sectors in Africa are facing or are likely to face as a result of this pandemic. We recognize loss of revenues from tourism as a major impact that could negatively influence the management of wildlife species and habitats. Loss of tourism revenues reduces capacity of the conservation agencies to fund conservation operations and support the benefit sharing schemes. Furthermore, it undermines the efficacy of conservation to compete with alternative economic activities which are ecologically damaging. Increased unemployment and household poverty due to closure of businesses may exacerbate wildlife crime and unsustainable activities. Additionally, contributions from donor-funding organizations and development partners cannot be guaranteed as revenues may be diverted to support other sectors including health. In order to address and minimize the impacts and reduce the risks to the wildlife sector, the following policy measures are recommended: ensure adequate budget for conservation;develop a crisis management plan;reconsider protocols for conducting wildlife trade;develop a comprehensive tourism recovery plan;promote scientific studies focusing on zoonoses and adopt a One-Health Approach as a matter of urgency in dealing with COVID-19 and future pandemics. © The Author(s) 2021.","Kideghesho, J.

The identification of factors that enhance cardiac repair by the restoration of the vascular network is, therefore, of great significance. Here, we show that the transcription factor Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) is increased in stressed cardiomyocytes and induces a cardioprotective cross-talk between cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells to enhance angiogenesis after ischemia. Single-cell sequencing indicates ZEB2 to be enriched in injured cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of ZEB2 results in impaired cardiac contractility and infarct healing post-myocardial infarction (post-MI), while cardiomyocyte-specific ZEB2 overexpression improves cardiomyocyte survival and cardiac function. We identified Thymosin ß4 (TMSB4) and Prothymosin &#945; (PTMA) as main paracrine factors released from cardiomyocytes to stimulate angiogenesis by enhancing endothelial cell migration, and whose regulation is validated in our in vivo models. Therapeutic delivery of ZEB2 to cardiomyocytes in the infarcted heart induces the expression of TMSB4 and PTMA, which enhances angiogenesis and prevents cardiac dysfunction. These findings reveal ZEB2 as a beneficial factor during ischemic injury, which may hold promise for the identification of new therapies.","Gladka, Monika M; Kohela, Arwa; Molenaar, Bas; Versteeg, Danielle; Kooijman, Lieneke; Monshouwer-Kloots, Jantine; Kremer, Veerle; Vos, Harmjan R; Huibers, Manon M H; Haigh, Jody J; Huylebroeck, Danny; Boon, Reinier A; Giacca, Mauro; van Rooij, Eva",Nat Commun,225,2

In Italy, it was first and only identified in July 2019 in our hospital (San Martino Hospital, Genoa), where infection or colonization cases have been increasingly recognized during the following months. To gain insights into the introduction, transmission dynamics, and resistance traits of this fungal pathogen, consecutive C. auris isolates collected from July 2019 to May 2020 (n = 10) were subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and antifungal susceptibility testing (AST); patients' clinical and trace data were also collected. WGS resolved all isolates within the genetic clade I (South Asian) and showed that all but one were part of a cluster likely stemming from the index case. Phylogenetic molecular clock analyses predicted a recent introduction (May 2019) in the hospital setting and suggested that most transmissions were associated with a ward converted to a COVID-19-dedicated ICU during the pandemic. All isolates were resistant to amphotericin B, voriconazole, and fluconazole at high-level, owing to mutations in ERG11(K143R) and TACB1(A640V). Present data demonstrated that the introduction of MDR C. auris in Italy was a recent event and suggested that its spread could have been facilitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study based on a web-based survey applied to physiotherapists living in Portugal. The survey included sociodemographic, health status and clinical practice questions. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (personal, work- and patient-related burnout), the Resilience Scale, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales and the Satisfaction with Life Scale were used. RESULTS: A total of 511 physiotherapists (median 33 years old, 82% females) completed the survey. The participants worked mainly in private practice (50%) and wards (35%). During COVID-19, 52% were working directly with patients, but only 18% were working with COVID-19 patients. Personal (42%), work- (42%) and patient-related burnout (25%) was observed. Three significant models explained personal- (R2 = 51%), work- (R2 = 31%) and patient-related burnout (R2 = 16%). Lower levels of resilience and higher levels of depression and stress were significantly associated with personal, work- and patient-related burnout. Being female and working directly with patients were additionally associated with both personal and work-related burnout. Having health problems and working with COVID-19 patients were only associated with personal burnout. CONCLUSIONS: More than 40% of physiotherapists experienced personal and work-related burnout and 25% patient-related burnout, with resilience, depression and stress having a relevant role in the three burnout dimensions.

More specifically, a compartmental epidemic model has been considered, in which vaccination, social distance measures, and testing of susceptible individuals have been included. Since the application of these mitigation measures entails a degree of uncertainty, the effects of the uncertainty about the application of social distance actions and testing of susceptible individuals on the disease transmission have been quantified, under the assumption of a mass vaccination program deployment. A spectral approach has been employed, which allows the uncertainty propagation through the epidemic model to be represented by means of the polynomial chaos expansion of the output random variables. In particular, a statistical moment-based polynomial chaos expansion has been implemented, which provides a surrogate model for the compartments of the epidemic model, and allows the statistics, the probability distributions of the interesting output variables of the model at a given time instant to be estimated and the sensitivity analysis to be conducted. The purpose of the sensitivity analysis is to understand which uncertain parameters have most influence on a given output random variable of the model at a given time instant. Several numerical experiments have been conducted whose results show that the proposed spectral approach to uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of epidemic models provides a useful tool to control and mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, when it comes to healthcare resource planning.","Olivares, Alberto; Staffetti, Ernesto",Chaos Solitons Fractals,225,20

This study aimed at evaluating the relationship between area-level indicators of income and total mortality during the first phase of COVID-19 pandemic in the most hit Italian region. METHODS: We conducted an ecological study based on the number of deaths registered in the municipalities of the Lombardy region (Italy) between January 2019 and June 2020. Municipalities were grouped according to quintiles of average income and pension of their resident population. Monthly age-standardized mortality ratios (MRs) between the poorest and the richest municipalities and the corresponding 95% CI were computed to evaluate whether the pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities widened during the pandemic. RESULTS: Over the study period, 175 853 deaths were registered. During the pre-pandemic period (January 2019 to February 2020) the MR between the poorest and the richest municipalities ranged between 1.12 (95% CI: 1.00-1.25) and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.20-1.47).

Healthcare professionals have been particularly vulnerable because of the unprecedented shortage of Facepiece Respirators (FPRs), which act as fundamental tools to protect the medical staff treating the coronavirus patients. In addition, many FPRs are designed to be disposable single-use devices, creating an issue related to the generation of large quantities of non-biodegradable waste. In this contribution, we describe a plasma-based decontamination technique designed to circumvent the shortages of FPRs and alleviate the environmental problems posed by waste generation. The system utilizes a Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) to generate ozone and feed it through the fibers of the FPRs. The flow-through configuration is different than canonical ozone-based sterilization methods, in which the equipment is placed in a sealed ozone-containing enclosure without any flow through the mask polymer fibers. We demonstrate the rapid decontamination of surgical masks using Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) as model pathogens, with the flow-through configuration providing a drastic reduction in sterilization time compared to the canonical approach. We also demonstrate that there is no deterioration in mask structure or filtration efficiency resulting from sterilization. Finally, we show that this decontamination approach can be implemented using readily available tools, such as a plastic box, a glass tube, few 3D printed components, and the high-voltage power supply from a plasma globe toy. The prototype assembled for this study is portable and affordable, with effectiveness comparable to that of larger and more expensive equipment.","Schwan, Joseph; Alva, Troy R; Nava, Giorgio; Rodriguez, Carla Berrospe; Dunn, Zachary Spencer; Chartron, Justin W; Morgan, Joshua; Wang, Pin; Mangolini, Lorenzo",Sci Rep,225,16

Elevations in serum IL-6 concentrations in patients with severe COVID-19 have led to renewed interest in the cytokine as a therapeutic target. However, although the pro-inflammatory properties of IL-6 are widely known, the cytokine also has a series of important physiological and anti-inflammatory functions. An adequate understanding of the complex processes by which IL-6 signalling occurs is crucial for the correct interpretation of IL-6 concentrations in the blood or lung, the use of IL-6 as a critical care biomarker, or the design of effective anti-IL-6 strategies. Here, we outline the role of IL-6 in health and disease, explain the different types of IL-6 signalling and their contribution to the net biological effect of the cytokine, describe the approaches to IL-6 inhibition that are currently available, and discuss implications for the future use of treatments such as tocilizumab in the critical care setting.","McElvaney, Oliver J; Curley, Gerard F; Rose-John, Stefan; McElvaney, Noel G",Lancet Respir Med,225,18

This cohort reports the first 1,255 adult cases who received anti-COVID-19 treatment at a Spanish hospital from March 1 to 24, 2020. The cost of treatment was calculated. Logistic regression model was used to explore the risk factors present on admission associated with ARDS. Bivariate Cox proportional hazard ratio model was employed to determine the hazard ratio (HR) between individual factors and death. We included 1,255 patients (median age 65 years; 57.8% male), of which 92.3% required hospitalization.

Multiple reports have described a variety of neurological manifestations associated with infection that may contribute to worsening COVID-19. The neuropathology of SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood, necessitating the development of relevant animal models for investigation. Here, we report marked neuropathology but with limited virus in the CNS of two non-human primate models (NHPs) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Adult male and female purpose-bred Rhesus macaques (RMs;n = 4) and wild-caught African green monkeys (AGMs;n = 4) were inoculated with the 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 strain of SARS-CoV-2 via multi-route mucosal or aerosol challenge. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (SARS-N) mRNA was detected in nasal swabs within the first week of inoculation, demonstrating infection of all study animals. All animals were euthanized at the study endpoint of 4 weeks post-inoculation, with the exception of two AGMs that reached humane endpoints at 8- and 22-days post-challenge. Seven regions of the CNS were investigated for pathology and virus infection. Archival brain tissues from two non-infected adult female RMs were used as aged-matched controls. Mild, but chronic, hypoxemia with impaired gas exchange were suggested by SpO2 values that stayed at or below 95% and elevated blood CO2 in the majority of the study animals. Neuroinflammation was seen throughout the brain and brainstem but with limited virus detection by immunohistochemistry and RNAscope of fixed tissues and viral RNA detection using a highly sensitive CRISPR-fluorescent detection system on RNA extracted from sectioned brain lysates. In addition, neuronal injury and death were suggested by pyknotic and karyolytic nuclei and cellular blebbing. Limited myelin vacuolation was revealed in two infected animals through Luxol Fast Blue staining. Neuronal cleaved caspase 3 positivity was seen at a greater frequency in infected animals compared to controls, suggesting increased apoptosis in infection. Microhemorrhages were larger and more frequent among infected NHPs, as compared to controls. Neuroinflammation, neuronal injury and death, and microhemorrhages were seen in animals that did not develop severe respiratory disease and may suggest neuropathology contributes to on-going symptoms of convalesced patients. Our findings in NHPs are in agreement with human autopsy and neuroimaging studies and demonstrate this is a relevant animal model for investigating neuropathological changes associated with COVID-19. Our results also suggest that hypoxic-ischemic events leading to energy failure and neuronal injury, contribute to the neuropathological consequences of COVID-19. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenesis.","Rutkai, Ibolya Mayer Meredith Hellmers Linh Ning Bo Huang Zhen Monjure Christopher Coyne Carol Silvestri Rachel Golden Nadia Hensley Krystle Chandler Kristin Lehmicke Gabrielle Bix Gregory Maness Nicholas Russell-Lodrigue Kasi Hu Tony Roy Chad Blair Robert Bohm Rudolf Doyle-Meyers Lara Rappaport Jay Fischer Tracy",The FASEB Journal,225,1

We identify heparan sulfate as an important attachment factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Next, we show that sialic acids present on ACE2 prevent efficient spike/ACE2-interaction. While SARS-CoV infection is substantially limited by the sialic acid-mediated restriction in both human lung epithelial cells and ex vivo human lung tissues, infection by SARS-CoV-2 is limited to a lesser extent. We further demonstrate that the furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 spike is required for efficient virus replication in human lung but not intestinal tissues.

Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models have been used to predict CKD effects on transporter-mediated renal active secretion and CLr for hydrophilic nonpermeable compounds. However, no studies have shown systematic PBPK modeling of renal passive reabsorption or CLr for hydrophobic permeable drugs in CKD. The goal of this study was to expand our previously developed and verified mechanistic kidney model to develop a universal model to predict changes in CLr in CKD for permeable and nonpermeable drugs that accounts for the dramatic nonlinear effect of CKD on renal passive reabsorption of permeable drugs. The developed model incorporates physiologically-based tubular changes of reduced water reabsorption/increased tubular flow rate per remaining functional nephron in CKD. The final adaptive kidney model successfully (absolute fold error (AFE) all < 2) predicted renal passive reabsorption and CLr for 20 permeable and nonpermeable test compounds across the stages of CKD. In contrast, use of proportional glomerular filtration rate reduction approach without addressing tubular adaptation processes in CKD to predict CLr generated unacceptable CLr predictions (AFE = 2.61-7.35) for permeable compounds in severe CKD. Finally, the adaptive kidney model accurately predicted CLr of para-amino-hippuric acid and memantine, two secreted compounds, in CKD, suggesting successful integration of active secretion into the model, along with passive reabsorption. In conclusion, the developed adaptive kidney model enables mechanistic predictions of in vivo CLr through CKD progression without any empirical scaling factors and can be used for CLr predictions prior to assessment of drug disposition in renal impairment.","Huang, Weize; Isoherranen, Nina",CPT: pharmacomet. syst. pharmacol,225,8

METHODS: This is a multicenter, prospective observational cohort study. We analyzed data from 75 patients with COVID-19 infection undergoing vascular surgery procedures in 17 hospitals across Spain and Andorra between March and May 2020. The primary end point was 30-day mortality. Clinical Trials registry number NCT04333693. RESULTS: The mean age was 70.9 (45-94) and 58 (77.0%) patients were male. Around 70.7% had postoperative complications, 36.0% of patients experienced respiratory failure, 22.7% acute renal failure, and 22.7% acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). All-cause 30-days mortality rate was 37.3%.

Families came from Quebec, Canada, and the survey was done in the early stages of the lockdown (April-May 2020). A phone-based survey assessed parent and child COVID-19-related fears and concerns, family-related changes and health issues. Results showed the more fears parents have about COVID-19, the more fears their child also has. Moreover, changes in family sleep habits were associated with parental and child fears and concerns about COVID-19. Reduced access to health services was associated with parental concerns about COVID-19. If another lockdown was to be put in place in the future, it would be important to inform families on the importance of sleep schedules and to maintain or increase health appointments when possible.","Suffren, Sabrina; Dubois-Comtois, Karine; Lemelin, Jean-Pascal; St-Laurent, Diane; Milot, Tristan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),225,30

Pandemics and measures undertaken against them may cause changes in behavior; therefore, changes in injury patterns during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak can be expected when compared to the parallel period in previous years. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare injury-related hospitalization patterns during the overall national lockdown period with parallel periods of previous years. METHODS: A retrospective study was completed of all patients hospitalized from March 15 through April 30, for years 2016-2020. Data were obtained from 21 hospitals included in the national trauma registry during the study years. Clinical, demographic, and circumstantial parameters were compared amongst the years of the study. RESULTS: The overall volume of injured patients significantly decreased during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 outbreak, with the greatest decrease registered for road traffic collisions (RTCs). Patients' sex and ethnic compositions did not change, but a smaller proportion of children were hospitalized during the outbreak. Many more injuries were sustained at home during the outbreak, with proportions of injuries in all other localities significantly decreased. Injuries sustained during the COVID-19 outbreak were more severe, specifically due to an increase in severe injuries in RTCs and falls. The proportion of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations did not change, however more surgeries were performed; patients stayed less days in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown period of the COVID-19 outbreak led to a significant decrease in number of patients hospitalized due to trauma as compared to parallel periods of previous years. Nevertheless, trauma remains a major health care concern even during periods of high-impact disease outbreaks, in particular due to increased proportion of severe injuries and surgeries.","Rozenfeld, Michael; Peleg, Kobi; Givon, Adi; Bala, Miklosh; Shaked, Gad; Bahouth, Hany; Bodas, Moran",Prehosp Disaster Med,225,16

Many countries have reported cases of infection in children and newborns, and there is a trend of significantly increasing infections among these populations. Therefore, it is important to provide advice and guidance for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in children. Observations: Children are as susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection as adults. The manifestations in children are atypical, and children are much less likely to have critical cases. If children are infected, they may play an important role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 because their symptoms are less obvious and less likely to be detected. To prevent COVID-19 from spreading among children, efforts to prevent, and control the infection should be increased by controlling the source of infection, blocking the route of transmission and protecting the susceptible population. Conclusions and Relevance_ The early identification of the COVID-19 in children and the protection of families are important measures to prevent the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Qiao, Meng-Yuan; Chen, Na; Zou, Xian; Mao, Dan-Hua; Cui, Hong-Tao; Li, Wei-Bin; Miao, Jing-Kun; Chen, Qi-Xiong",Front.

New agents that address the hyperinflammatory ""cytokine storm"" and hypercoagulable pathology seen in these patients may be a promising approach to treat patients, minimize hospital stays, and ensure hospital wards and critical care units are able to operate effectively. Dociparstat sodium (DSTAT) is a glycosaminoglycan derivative of heparin with robust anti-inflammatory properties, with the potential to address underlying causes of coagulation disorders with substantially reduced risk of bleeding compared to commercially available heparin. METHODS: This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 trial to determine the safety and efficacy of DSTAT added to standard of care in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen. Phase 2 will enroll 12 participants in each of two dose-escalating cohorts to confirm the safety of DSTAT in this population. Following review of the data, an additional 50 participants will be enrolled. Contingent upon positive results, phase 3 will enroll approximately 450 participants randomized to DSTAT or placebo. The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants who survive and do not require mechanical ventilation through day 28. DISCUSSION: Advances in standard of care, recent emergency use authorizations, and positive data with dexamethasone have likely contributed to an increasing proportion of patients who are surviving without the need for mechanical ventilation. Therefore, examining the time to improvement in the NIAID score will be essential to provide a measure of drug effect on recovery. Analysis of additional endpoints, including supportive biomarkers (e.g., IL-6, HMGB1, soluble-RAGE, D-dimer), will be performed to further define the effect of DSTAT in patients with COVID-19 infection.

We propose that people commonly respond to health threats by managing their emotions with cognitive strategies such as reappraisal, which can reduce fear and protect mental health. However, because fear can also motivate health behaviors, reducing fear may also jeopardize health behaviors. In two diverse U.S. samples (N = 1,241) tracked across 3 months, sequential and cross-lagged panel mediation models indicated that reappraisal predicted lower fear about an ongoing health threat (COVID-19) and, in turn, better mental health but fewer recommended physical health behaviors. This trade-off was not inevitable, however: The use of reappraisal to increase socially oriented positive emotions predicted better mental health without jeopardizing physical health behaviors. Examining the costs and benefits of how people cope with health threats is essential for promoting better health outcomes for individuals and communities.","Smith, Angela M; Willroth, Emily C; Gatchpazian, Arasteh; Shallcross, Amanda J; Feinberg, Matthew; Ford, Brett Q",Psychol Sci,225,1

METHODS: HNSCC cases (oropharynx/larynx/hypopharynx) treated with definitive RT-hypo (60 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks), moderately accelerated radiotherapy (RT-acc) alone (70 Gy in 35 fractions over 6 weeks), or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) during 2005-2017 were included. Locoregional control (LRC) and distant control (DC) after RT-hypo, RT-acc, and CCRT were compared for various subgroups. RESULTS: The study identified 994 human papillomavirus-positive (HPV+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma cases (with 61, 254, and 679 receiving RT-hypo, RT-acc, and CCRT, respectively) and 1045 HPV- HNSCC cases (with 263, 451, and 331 receiving RT-hypo, RT-acc, and CCRT, respectively). The CCRT cohort had higher T/N categories, whereas the radiotherapy-alone patients were older. The median follow-up was 4.6 years. RT-hypo, RT-acc, and CCRT produced comparable 3-year LRC and DC for HPV+ T1-2N0-N2a disease (seventh edition of the TNM system [TNM-7]; LRC, 94%, 100%, and 94%; P = .769; DC, 94%, 100%, and 94%; P = .272), T1-T2N2b disease (LRC, 90%, 94%, and 97%; P = .445; DC, 100%, 96%, and 95%; P = .697), and T1-2N2c/T3N0-N2c disease (LRC, 89%, 93%, and 95%; P = .494; DC, 89%, 90%, and 87%; P = .838). Although LRC was also similar for T4/N3 disease (78%, 84%, and 88%; P = .677), DC was significantly lower with RT-hypo or RT-acc versus CCRT (67%, 65%, and 87%; P = .005). For HPV- HNSCC, 3-year LRC and DC were similar with RT-hypo, RT-acc, and CCRT in stages I and II (LRC, 85%, 89%, and 100%; P = .320; DC, 99%, 98%, and 100%; P = .446); however, RT-hypo and RT-acc had significantly lower LRC in stage III (76%, 69%, and 91%; P = .006), whereas DC rates were similar (92%, 85%, and 90%; P = .410). Lower LRC in stage III predominated in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma receiving RT-acc (62%) but not RT-hypo (80%) or CCRT (92%; RT-hypo vs CCRT: P = .270; RT-acc vs CCRT: P = .004). CCRT had numerically higher LRC in comparison with RT-hypo or RT-acc in stage IV (73%, 65%, and 66%; P = .336). CONCLUSIONS: It is proposed that RT-hypo be considered in place of CCRT for HPV+ T1-T3N0-N2c (TNM-7) HNSCCs, HPV- T1-T2N0 HNSCCs, and select stage III HNSCCs during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Huang, Shao Hui; O039,; Sullivan, Brian; Su, Jie; Ringash, Jolie; Bratman, Scott V; Kim, John; Hosni, Ali; Bayley, Andrew; Cho, John; Giuliani, Meredith; Hope, Andrew; Spreafico, Anna; Hansen, Aaron R; Siu, Lillian L; Gilbert, Ralph; Irish, Jonathan C; Goldstein, David; de Almeida, John; Tong, Li; Xu, Wei; Waldron, John",Cancer,225,5

Mask use can substantially reduce the epidemic size, with a greater impact if at least 50% of people wear a mask which has an effectiveness of at least 40%. Early mask use averts more cases than mask usage that is only implemented closer to the peak. No mask use, with a 6-week lockdown, results in 67,636 cases and 120 deaths by 1 October 2020 if no further lockdowns are used. If mask use at 70% uptake commences on 23 July 2020, this is reduced to 7,961 cases and 42 deaths. We estimated community mask effectiveness to be 11%. Conclusion(s): Lockdown and standard control measures may not have controlled the epidemic in Victoria. Mask use can substantially improve epidemic control if its uptake is higher than 50% and if moderately effective masks are used. Early mask use should be considered in other states if community transmission is present, as this has a greater effect than later mask wearing mandates.","Costantino, Valentina; Raina MacIntyre, Chandini",Front Public Health,225,16

Methods: A total of 224 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who underwent chest CT examination within the first day of admission were enrolled. CT findings, including the pattern and distribution of opacities, the number of lung lobes involved and the chest CT scores of lung involvement, were assessed. Independent predictors of adverse clinical outcomes were determined by multivariate regression analysis. Adverse outcome were defined as the need for mechanical ventilation or death. Results: Of 224 patients, 74 (33%) had adverse outcomes and 150 (67%) had good outcomes. There were higher frequencies of more than four lung zones involved (73% vs 32%), both central and peripheral distribution (57% vs 42%), consolidation (27% vs 17%), and air bronchogram (24% vs 13%) and higher initial chest CT scores (8.6±3.4 vs 5.4±2.1) (P < 0.05 for all) in the patients with poor outcomes. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that more than four lung zones (odds ratio [OR] 3.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44 to 12.89), age above 65 (OR 3.65; 95% CI: 1.11 to 10.59), the presence of comorbidity (OR 5.21; 95% CI: 1.64 to 19.22) and dyspnea on admission (OR 3.19; 95% CI: 1.35 to 8.46) were independent predictors of poor outcome. Conclusions: Involvement of more than four lung zones and a higher CT score on the initial chest CT were significantly associated with adverse clinical outcome. Initial chest CT findings may be helpful for predicting clinical outcome in patients with COVID-19.","Liu, Song; Nie, Chen; Xu, Qizhong; Xie, Hong; Wang, Maoren; Yu, Chengxin; Hou, Xuewen",Int J Med Sci,225,20

This cross-sectional study examined the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on food access among low-income and Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) in New York State. New York residents were recruited to complete a web-based survey through Qualtrics. The survey took place in May and June 2020 and asked participants about COVID-19 health impacts, risk factors, and food access. Chi-square analysis examined issues with food access experienced by demographic characteristics, work disruptions, health impacts, and household risk for contracting the virus and experiencing severe illness, and significant results were analyzed in a series of logistic regression models. After accounting for covariates, Hispanic respondents, those with likely Major Depressive Disorder, and essential workers were more likely to experience worse food access during COVID-19. Improved policies and services to address impacts on vulnerable populations such as BIPOC, those suffering from mental health disorders, and workers in lower-paying essential jobs can reduce the risk of food access issues at this time. Future research can identify how food access issues during the pandemic influenced diet quality, chronic disease risk and infection, and persistence of food access issues.","Clay, Lauren A; Rogus, Stephanie",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),225,24

Notably, coix seed is currently being used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of COVID-19 in China. However, coix seeds are generally contaminated by mycotoxins, and this risk cannot be ignored. In this paper, we developed a method that involves direct extraction and UHPLC-HRMS analysis for the simultaneous detection of 24 mycotoxins in coix seeds. UHPLC-HRMS instrument and data acquisition parameters, and the sample pretreatment were optimised. One-step extraction showed several advantages compared to the three commercial solid-phase extraction clean-up methods, including ease of use, reduced time of sample preparation, low cost, good recovery, and acceptable matrix effect. The method validation results indicate that all mycotoxins have good linearity and sensitivity. Recoveries were between 74.2-101.1%, and RSD ranged from 0.1-5.8%. The LOQs for 24 mycotoxins were in the range of 0.5-100 µg/kg. To survey the contamination levels of these mycotoxins in commercial coix seeds, more than 70 samples were collected from Chinese markets and were analysed using the newly developed method. Zearalenone (positive ratio: 98.7%, range:1.1-1562 µg/kg), deoxynivalenol (positive ratio: 87%, range: 8.4-382.5 µg/kg), nivalenol (positive ratio: 85.7%, range: 26.8-828.2 µg/kg), fumonisin B1 (positive ratio: 84.4%, range:2.5-314.5 µg/kg), fumonisin B2 (positive ratio: 75.3%, range:1.6-72.8 µg/kg), fumonisin B3 (positive ratio: 48%, range:1.0-203.6 µg/kg), aflatoxin B1 (positive ratio: 29.9%, range: 0.39-14.7 µg/kg), sterigmatocystin (positive ratio: 29.9%, range: 1.4-51.6 µg/kg), and tenuazonic acid (positive ratio: 19.5%, range 36.1-105.7 µg/kg) were the most frequent mycotoxin contaminants. These results highlight the importance of routine monitoring and control of mycotoxins in coix seeds.","Wu, Yu; Ye, Jin; Xuan, Zhihong; Li, Li; Wang, Haibo; Wang, Songshan; Liu, Hongmei; Wang, Songxue",Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess,225,16

While controlling this communicable disease is of utmost importance, the long-term effect on individuals with non-communicable diseases (NCD) is significant. Although certain NCDs appear to increase the severity of COVID-19 and mortality risk, SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors with NCDs may also affect the progression of their pre-existing clinical conditions. Infection containment measures will have substantial short- and long-term consequences; social distancing and quarantine restrictions will reduce physical activity and increase other unhealthy lifestyles, thus increasing NCD risk factors and worsening clinical symptoms. Vitamin D levels might decrease and there might be a rise in mental health disorders. Many countries have made changes to routine management of NCD patients, e.g., cancelling non-urgent outpatient visits, which will have important implications for NCD management, diagnosis of new-onset NCDs, medication adherence, and NCD progression. We may have opportunities to learn from this unprecedented crisis on how to leverage healthcare technologies and improve procedures to optimize healthcare service provision. This article discusses how the COVID-19 outbreak and related infection control measures could hit the most frail individuals, worsening the condition of NCD patients, while further jeopardizing the sustainability of the healthcare systems. We suggest ways to define an integrated strategy that could involve both public institutional entities and the private sector to safeguard frail individuals and mitigate the impact of the outbreak.","Palmer, Katie; Monaco, Alessandro; Kivipelto, Miia; Onder, Graziano; Maggi, Stefania; Michel, Jean-Pierre; Prieto, Rita; Sykara, Georgia; Donde, Shaantanu",Aging Clin Exp Res,225,16

METHODS: A follow-up survey one month later (April-May 2020) measured infection by rRT-PCR and IgM, IgA, IgG to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein by Luminex. Antibody kinetics, including IgG subclasses, was assessed till month 3. RESULTS: At month 1, the prevalence of infection measured by rRT-PCR and serology was 14.9% (84/565) and the seroprevalence 14.5% (82/565). We found 25 (5%) new infections in participants without previous evidence of infection (501). IgM, IgG and IgA levels declined in 3 months (antibody decay rates 0.15 (95% CI, 0.11; 0.19), 0.66 (95% CI, 0.54; 0.82), 0.12 (95% CI, 0.09; 0.16), respectively), and 68.33% of HCW had seroreverted for IgM, 3.08% for IgG, and 24.29% for IgA. The most frequent subclass responses were IgG1 (highest levels) and IgG2, followed by IgG3, and only IgA1 but no IgA2 was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous and improved surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCW remains critical, particularly in high-risk groups. The observed fast decay of IgA and IgM levels have implications for seroprevalence studies using these isotypes.","Moncunill, Gemma; Mayor, Alfredo; Santano, Rebeca; Jiménez, Alfons; Vidal, Marta; Tortajada, Marta; Sanz, Sergi; Méndez, Susana; Llupià, Anna; Aguilar, Ruth; Alonso, Selena; Barrios, Diana; Carolis, Carlo; Cisteró, Pau; Chóliz, Eugenia; Cruz, Angeline; Fochs, Silvia; Jairoce, Chenjerai; Hecht, Jochen; Lamoglia, Montserrat; Martínez, Mikel J; Moreno, Javier; Mitchell, Robert A; Ortega, Natalia; Pey, Nuria; Puyol, Laura; Ribes, Marta; Rosell, Neus; Figueroa-Romero, Antía; Sotomayor, Patricia; Torres, Sara; Williams, Sarah; Barroso, Sonia; Vilella, Anna; Trilla, Antoni; Varela, Pilar; Dobaño, Carlota; Garcia-Basteiro, Alberto L",J. infect. dis,225,29

In the case of pure Hebbian learning, we find that the normalised weights equal the promotion probabilities of weights up to correction terms that depend on the learning rate and are usually small. A similar relation can be derived for STDP algorithms, where the normalised weight values reflect a difference between the promotion and demotion probabilities of the weight. These relations are practically useful in that they allow checking for convergence of Hebbian and STDP algorithms. Another application is novelty detection.

The ordering of events is vital for the discovery of process models. However, the timestamps of events may be unreliable or imprecise. To further complicate matters, also causally unrelated events may be ordered in time. The fact that one event is followed by another does not imply that the former causes the latter. This paper explores the relationship between time and order. Moreover, it describes an approach to preprocess event data having timestamp-related problems. This approach avoids using accidental or unreliable orders and timestamps, creates partial orders to capture uncertainty, and allows for exploiting domain knowledge to (re)order events. Optionally, the approach also generates interleavings to be able to use existing process mining techniques that cannot handle partially ordered event data. The approach has been implemented using ProM and can be applied to any event log.","Aalst, Wil M.P. van der; Santos, Luis",,225,16

The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed that every country implement a comprehensive set of measures to prevent infection, detect cases, interrupt transmission, control clusters, suppress outbreaks and reduce mortality. Throughout the world, four systems capabilities are emerging that are important for societies to get ahead of the virus and become COVID-19 ready. First: understand the pattern of infection locally and act on it effectively: assess the status of the outbreak; act rapidly and robustly to interrupt transmission. Second: enable people to be active participants in their own responses. Third: focus on the places where people are most at risk of infection. Fourth: assess the performance of responses to COVID-19 infection: detecting cases, interrupting chains of transmission, minimizing adverse consequences, protecting the most vulnerable and ensuring opportunities for sustainable livelihoods and well-being for all, leaving no-one behind. These four capabilities are being woven together within societies: successful weaving can be helped through focusing on three interlinked elements: making information available; assessing and reducing risk; and being able to suppress outbreaks rapidly. This means involving everyone in the response and having strong public health defences. Governments, authorities, public health teams, employers and community organizations make it possible for us to stay safe but, in the end, what happens is up to all of us, individually and collectively.

Variability in exacerbation diagnoses and treatment have led drug developers to employ ""objective"" exacerbation definitions combining antimicrobial treatment (AT) and the presence of &#8805;4 of 12 respiratory criteria (first published by Fuchs et al. [NEJM 1994;331(10):637-42]). Assumptions underlying this approach have yet to be formally evaluated. METHODS: Respiratory events (RE) observed during a 48-week trial of ataluren (NCT02139306), a read-through agent for premature nonsense codons, were compared across six exacerbation definitions: any AT, intravenous AT (IVAT), &#8805;4 Fuchs criteria present, AT plus &#8805;4 Fuchs criteria, IVAT plus &#8805;4 Fuchs criteria, and investigator assessment. Fuchs definitions were evaluated by assessing missingness of individual criteria and associations between criteria presence and clinician exacerbation assessment. RESULTS: Among 751 RE, more than one third had &#8805;4 Fuchs criteria present but were not assessed as exacerbations by investigators. Data for &#8805;1 and for 4 Fuchs criteria, respectively, were missing for ~ 90% and >30% of RE. Only 6/12 Fuchs criteria were present more often when investigators assessed RE as exacerbations than when they did not. CONCLUSIONS: ""Objective"" definitions have shortcomings inconsistent with their purpose of optimizing exacerbation capture in clinical trials : 1) they capture events clinicians do not consider exacerbations, 2) are prone to data missingness which can bias the likelihood of meeting the definition, and 3) employ criteria that are not associated with investigator assessment of exacerbation.","VanDevanter, Donald R; Hamblett, Nicole Mayer; Simon, Noah; McIntosh, Joseph; Konstan, Michael W",J. cyst. fibros,225,0

So far, however, limited data are available for children. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the clinical and chest CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19 in preschool children. METHODS: From January 26, 2020 to February 20, 2020, the clinical and initial chest CT imaging data of eight preschool children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from two hospitals were retrospectively collected. The chest CT imaging characteristics, including the distribution, shape, and density of lesions, and the pleural effusion, pleural changes, and enlarged lymph nodes were evaluated. RESULTS: Two cases (25%) were classified as mild type, and they showed no obvious abnormal CT findings or minimal pleural thickening on the right side. Five cases (62.5%) were classified as moderate type. Among these patients, one case showed consolidation located in the subpleural region of the right upper lobe, with thickening in the adjacent pleura; one case showed multiple consolidation and ground-glass opacities with blurry margins; one case displayed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the left upper lobe; and two cases displayed asthmatic bronchitis-like changes. One case (12.5%) was classified as critical type and showed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the bilateral lungs, presenting blurred and messy bilateral lung markings and multiple patchy shadows scattered along the lung markings with blurry margins.

It is believed that if a CF patient ceases treatment for 2 days, this can result in an exacerbation. One week of missed treatments can result in a hospitalization and 1 month of missed treatments can result in an earlier demise. With a global pandemic that has affected more than 9 million people, many CF clinics were required to take steps to avoid transmission of this dangerous virus. This may result in delays in delivery of timely CF care due to closure of clinics and pulmonary function testing (PFT) laboratories and limited staff allowed on site for conducting in-person visits. These measures, along with suggestions from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) to extend the social distancing longer than traditional CDC recommendations for the CF community, create an urgent need to explore novel ways to deliver safer care via new standards in chronic health conditions like CF. Especially, as these preventive strategies may be necessary for long-term maintenance, few objective alternatives exist to guide clinicians and allied health professionals in CF centers how to proceed in this new era. This also presents an opportunity for novel approaches that could improve delivery of CF care with remote monitoring and real-time delivery of care in patients' home environments. Such emerging approaches could benefit patient care, leading to reduced costs and readmissions and improved access to care, medication adherence, and patient communication. We summarize our own experience and discuss the emerging delivery of CF care which can be generalizable to other pulmonary illnesses.","Womack, Caitlin; Farsin, Ruhan; Farsad, Mahsa; Chaudary, Nauman",Int J Gen Med,225,26

It is essential to understand vaccine hesitancy among SNF workers to inform vaccine campaigns going forward. OBJECTIVE: To describe the concerns raised among healthcare workers and staff from SNFs during town hall meetings. DESIGN: Sixty-three SNFs from four corporations were invited to send Opinion Leaders, outspoken staff from nursing, nurse aid, dietary, housekeeping or recreational therapy, to attend a 1-h virtual town hall meeting. Meetings used a similar format where the moderator solicited concerns that the attendees themselves had or had heard from others in the facility about the COVID-19 vaccine. Physicians and moderators used personal stories to address concerns and reaffirmed positive emotions. SETTING: Twenty-six video town hall meetings with SNF staff. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare workers and staff, with physicians serving as content experts. MEASUREMENT: Questions and comments about the COVID-19 vaccines noted by physicians. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety three staff from 50 facilities participated in 26 meetings between December 30, 2020 and January 15, 2021. Most staff reported getting information about the vaccine from friends or social media. Concerns about how rapidly the vaccines were developed and side effects, including infertility or pregnancy related concerns, were frequently raised. There were no differences in concerns raised by discipline. Questions about returning to prior activities after being vaccinated were common and offered the opportunity to build on positive emotions to reduce vaccine hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: Misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine was widespread among SNF staff. Sharing positive emotions and stories may be more effective than sharing data when attempting to reduce vaccine hesitancy in SNF staff.","Berry, Sarah D; Johnson, Kimberly S; Myles, Lonnita; Herndon, Laurie; Montoya, Ana; Fashaw, Shekinah; Gifford, David",J Am Geriatr Soc,225,16

RESULTS: In this cohort, 39 (25.8%) patients had diabetes, 62 (41.1%) patients were severe cases, while 33 (22.0%) patients died in hospital. The TyG index levels were significantly higher in the severe cases and death group (mild vs. severe 8.7 ± 0.6 vs. 9.2 ± 0.6, P < 0.001; survivor vs. deceased 8.8 ± 0.6 vs. 9.3 ± 0.7, P < 0.001), respectively.

SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than two million deaths after one year of the pandemic. The world is experiencing a deep economic recession. Safe and effective vaccines are needed to prevent further morbidity and mortality. Vaccine candidates against COVID-19 have been developed at an unprecedented speed, with more than 200 vaccine candidates currently under investigation. Among those, 20 candidates have entered the clinical Phase 3 to evaluate efficacy, and three have been approved by the European Medicines Agency. The aim of immunization is to act against infection, disease and/or transmission. However, the measurement of vaccine efficacy is challenging, as efficacy trials need to include large cohorts with verum and placebo cohorts. In the future, this will be even more challenging as further vaccine candidates will receive approval, an increasing number of humans will receive vaccinations and incidence might decrease. To evaluate novel and second-generation vaccine candidates, randomized placebo-controlled trials might not be appropriate anymore. Correlates of protection (CoP) could be an important tool to evaluate novel vaccine candidates, but vaccine-induced CoP have not been clearly defined for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In this review, we report on immunogenicity against natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccine-induced immune responses and discuss immunological markers that can be linked to protection. By discussing the immunogenicity and efficacy of forerunner vaccines, we aim to give a comprehensive overview of possible efficacy measures and CoP.","Koch, Till; Mellinghoff, Sibylle C; Shamsrizi, Parichehr; Addo, Marylyn M; Dahlke, Christine",,225,16

Several factors are thought to predispose young dogs to microbiological infections. Identifying the cause of death is often a challenge, and broad diagnostic analysis is often needed. Here, we aimed to determine the infectious causes of death in young dogs aged up to 1 year, examining how it relates to age (under and over 6 months), lifestyle (owned versus ownerless), breed (purebred and crossbreed), and gender. A retrospective study was conducted in a 3-year period (2015-2017) on 138 dead dogs that had undergone necropsy and microbiological diagnostics. Enteritis and pneumonia were the most commonly observed lesions. Polymicrobism was more prevalent (62.3%) than single-agent infections and associated with a higher rate of generalised lesions. Ownerless dogs showed over a three-fold higher predisposition to viral coinfections than owned dogs. Above all, canine parvovirus was the most prevalent agent (77.5%), followed by canine coronavirus (31.1%) and canine adenovirus (23.9%); ownerless pups had a higher predisposition to these viruses. Escherichia coli (23.9%), Clostridium perfringens type A (18.1%), and Enterococcus spp. (8.7%) were the most commonly identified bacteria, which mostly involved in coinfections. A lower prevalence of CDV and Clostridium perfringens type A was observed in puppies under 6 months of age. In conclusion, this study is the first comprehensive survey on a wide panel of microbiological agents related to necropsy lesions. It lays the groundwork for future studies attempting to understand the circulation of infectious agents in a determined area.","Cardillo, Lorena; Piegari, Giuseppe; Iovane, Valentina; Viscardi, Maurizio; Alfano, Flora; Cerrone, Anna; Pagnini, Ugo; Montagnaro, Serena; Galiero, Giorgio; Pisanelli, Giuseppe; Fusco, Giovanna",Vet.

Given the effects of COVID-19 on pulmonary tissues, chest radiographic imaging has become a necessity for screening and monitoring the disease. Numerous studies have proposed Deep Learning approaches for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. Although these methods achieved astonishing performance in detection, they have used limited chest X-ray (CXR) repositories for evaluation, usually with a few hundred COVID-19 CXR images only. Thus, such data scarcity prevents reliable evaluation with the potential of overfitting. In addition, most studies showed no or limited capability in infection localization and severity grading of COVID-19 pneumonia. In this study, we address this urgent need by proposing a systematic and unified approach for lung segmentation and COVID-19 localization with infection quantification from CXR images. To accomplish this, we have constructed the largest benchmark dataset with 33,920 CXR images, including 11,956 COVID-19 samples, where the annotation of ground-truth lung segmentation masks is performed on CXRs by a novel human-machine collaborative approach. An extensive set of experiments was performed using the state-of-the-art segmentation networks, U-Net, U-Net++, and Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN). The developed network, after an extensive iterative process, reached a superior performance for lung region segmentation with Intersection over Union (IoU) of 96.11% and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 97.99%. Furthermore, COVID-19 infections of various shapes and types were reliably localized with 83.05% IoU and 88.21% DSC.

The unavailability of specific treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection necessitates the focus of all scientists in this direction. The reported antiviral activities of guanidine alkaloids encouraged us to run a comprehensive in silico binding affinity of fifteen guanidine alkaloids against five different proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which we investigated. The investigated proteins are COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) (PDB ID: 6lu7), spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYB), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYO), membrane glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6M17), and a non-structural protein (nsp10) (PDB ID: 6W4H). The binding energies for all tested compounds indicated promising binding affinities. A noticeable superiority for the pentacyclic alkaloids particularly, crambescidin 786 (5) and crambescidin 826 (13) has been observed. Compound 5 exhibited very good binding affinities against Mpro (&#916;G = -8.05 kcal/mol), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (&#916;G = -6.49 kcal/mol), and nsp10 (&#916;G = -9.06 kcal/mol). Compound 13 showed promising binding affinities against Mpro (&#916;G = -7.99 kcal/mol), spike glycoproteins (&#916;G = -6.95 kcal/mol), and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (&#916;G = -8.01 kcal/mol). Such promising activities might be attributed to the long &#969;-fatty acid chain, which may play a vital role in binding within the active sites. The correlation of c Log P with free binding energies has been calculated. Furthermore, the SAR of the active compounds has been clarified. The Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) studies were carried out in silico for the 15 compounds; most examined compounds showed optimal to good range levels of ADMET aqueous solubility, intestinal absorption and being unable to pass blood brain barrier (BBB), non-inhibitors of CYP2D6, non-hepatotoxic, and bind plasma protein with a percentage less than 90%. The toxicity of the tested compounds was screened in silico against five models (FDA rodent carcinogenicity, carcinogenic potency TD50, rat maximum tolerated dose, rat oral LD50, and rat chronic lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL)). All compounds showed expected low toxicity against the tested models. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were also carried out to confirm the stable binding interactions of the most promising compounds, 5 and 13, with their targets.

In the current study, we investigated experienced stress in 693 healthcare workers, with hair samples for cortisol analysis collected from a subset of 67 female nurses. The HCCs in two 3 cm hair segments corresponding to periods before and during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 were compared. To evaluate the effect of working in the first line, the sample was divided into two groups based on the COVID-19 risk estimated by the nurses. Covariates in the model included perceived stress (PSS), perceived social support (MSPSS), and quality of sleep (PSQI) measured via an online questionnaire. The data showed that more than 75% of healthcare workers agreed that COVID-19 led to increased stress at their workplace. The hair cortisol analysis showed higher HCCs in the hair segments corresponding to the time of the pandemic compared to hair corresponding to an earlier period (partial Î·290%CI = 0.123-0.397); in the same model, higher HCCs were also found in nurses from high-risk environments compared to low-risk ones (partial Î·290%CI = 0.002-0.176). None of the subjective questionnaire measures were significant predictors of HCCs.

This study investigates the impact that family-work conflict, social isolation, distracting environment, job autonomy, and self-leadership have on employees' productivity, work engagement, and stress experienced when WFH during the pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data collected through an online questionnaire completed by 209 employees WFH during the pandemic. The assumptions were tested using hierarchical linear regression. RESULTS: Employees' family-work conflict and social isolation were negatively related, while self-leadership and autonomy were positively related, to WFH productivity and WFH engagement. Family-work conflict and social isolation were negatively related to WFH stress, which was not affected by autonomy and self-leadership. CONCLUSION: Individual- and work-related aspects both hinder and facilitate WFH during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Galanti, Teresa; Guidetti, Gloria; Mazzei, Elisabetta; Zappalà, Salvatore; Toscano, Ferdinando",J Occup Environ Med,225,10

The purpose of this study was to describe cancer caregivers' emotional, physical, and financial strain during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared to preCOVID-19, and explore racial and ethnic variations in caregiver strain. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey using Lucid, LLC, incorporating quotas for race, ethnicity, gender and age. Caregivers had to be adults living in the USA and currently providing unpaid care to an adult cancer patient (i.e., during COVID-19) and prior to the pandemic. We assessed the caregivers' emotional, physical, and financial strain and asked them to compare to preCOVID-19 caregiving. Analyses included descriptive and linear regression adjusting for sociodemographic and caregiving-related variables. RESULTS: A total of 285 caregivers met eligibility, and most were nonHispanic white (72.3%) and female (59.6%). Based on a scale of ""1: Much lower"" to ""5: Much higher"", the financial, physical and emotional strain/stress experienced by caregivers compared to preCOVID-19 was, on average, 3.52 (SD: 0.82; range: 1-5) for financial strain, 3.61 (SD: 0.86; range: 1-5) for physical strain, and 3.88 (SD: 0.89; range: 1-5) for emotional stress. NonHispanic black caregivers were significantly more likely than nonHispanic white caregivers to indicate that caregiving-related financial strain was higher than preCOVID-19. Moreover, Hispanic caregivers compared to nonHispanic white caregivers reported caregiving-related emotional stress was higher than preCOVID-19. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a need to be attentive to racial and ethnic variations in emotional and financial strain and provide targeted support in clinical care and via public policy during a public health crisis.","Longacre, Margaret L; Miller, Melissa F; Fang, Carolyn Y",Support. care cancer,225,20

Data from national, crowdsourced surveys conducted on March 31st, 2020 and February 13th, 2019 were compared. Average levels of eating to cope and food addiction symptoms did not appear to shift during the early stages of the pandemic; however, U.S. adults ate about 14% more added sugars. Moreover, greater stress in response to the pandemic was associated with greater eating to cope, added sugars intake, food addiction symptoms, drinking to cope, and drinking frequency. These associations differed by the presence of state-level stay-at-home orders, perceived vulnerability to disease, age, U.S. political party affiliation, and gender. Although eating behaviors did not appear to majorly shift during the early stages of the pandemic, stress from the pandemic may intensify some maladaptive coping tendencies among U.S. adults.","Cummings, Jenna R; Ackerman, Joshua M; Wolfson, Julia A; Gearhardt, Ashley N",Appetite,225,20

In this paper, we describe the notion of interval-valued picture hesitant fuzzy set and the operational laws of interval-valued picture hesitant fuzzy variables. Moreover, we derive some dynamic interval-valued picture hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators (based on Einstein operators) to aggregate the interval-valued picture hesitant fuzzy information collected at different periods. Some desirable properties of these aggregation operators are discussed in detail. In addition, we develop the approaches to tackle the multi-period decision-making problems, where all decision information takes the form of interval-valued picture hesitant fuzzy information collected at different periods. In an attempt to illustrate the applications of the proposed approaches, two numerical examples are given to measure the impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in daily life and to identify the optimal investment opportunity. Finally, a comparative analysis of the proposed and existing studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

We examine and provide novel insights on the key drivers and barriers towards COVID-19 vaccine uptake. DESIGN: This study involved an anonymous cross-sectional online survey circulated across the UK in September 2020. The survey was designed to include several sections to collect demographic data and responses on (1) extent of agreement regarding various statements about COVID-19 and vaccinations, (2) previous vaccination habits (eg, if they had previously declined vaccination) and (3) interest in participation in vaccine trials. Multinominal logistic models examined demographic factors that may impact vaccine uptake. We used principle component analysis and text mining to explore perception related to vaccine uptake. SETTING: The survey was circulated through various media, including posts on social media networks (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram), national radio, news articles, Clinical Research Network website and newsletter, and through 150 West Midlands general practices via a text messaging service. PARTICIPANTS: There were a total of 4884 respondents of which 9.44% were black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) group. The majority were women (n=3416, 69.9%) and of white ethnicity (n=4127, 84.5%). RESULTS: Regarding respondents, overall, 3873 (79.3%) were interested in taking approved COVID-19 vaccines, while 677 (13.9%) were unsure, and 334 (6.8%) would not take a vaccine. Participants aged over 70 years old (OR=4.63) and the BAME community (OR=5.48) were more likely to take an approved vaccine. Smokers (OR=0.45) and respondents with no known illness (OR=0.70) were less likely to accept approved vaccines. The study identified 16 key reasons for not accepting approved vaccines, the most common (60%) being the possibility of the COVID-19 vaccine having side effects. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an insight into focusing on specific populations to reduce vaccine hesitancy.

As professionals who place value on evidence-based practice, climate change is something we cannot ignore. The current pandemic of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has demonstrated how global crises can arise suddenly and have a significant impact on public health. Global warming, a chronic process punctuated by acute episodes of extreme weather events, is an insidious global health crisis needing at least as much attention. Many neurological diseases are complex chronic conditions influenced at many levels by changes in the environment. This review aimed to collate and evaluate reports from clinical and basic science about the relationship between climate change and epilepsy. The keywords climate change, seasonal variation, temperature, humidity, thermoregulation, biorhythm, gene, circadian rhythm, heat, and weather were used to search the published evidence. A number of climatic variables are associated with increased seizure frequency in people with epilepsy. Climate change-induced increase in seizure precipitants such as fevers, stress, and sleep deprivation (e.g. as a result of more frequent extreme weather events) or vector-borne infections may trigger or exacerbate seizures, lead to deterioration of seizure control, and affect neurological, cerebrovascular, or cardiovascular comorbidities and risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Risks are likely to be modified by many factors, ranging from individual genetic variation and temperature-dependent channel function, to housing quality and global supply chains. According to the results of the limited number of experimental studies with animal models of seizures or epilepsy, different seizure types appear to have distinct susceptibility to seasonal influences. Increased body temperature, whether in the context of fever or not, has a critical role in seizure threshold and seizure-related brain damage. Links between climate change and epilepsy are likely to be multifactorial, complex, and often indirect, which makes predictions difficult. We need more data on possible climate-driven altered risks for seizures, epilepsy, and epileptogenesis, to identify underlying mechanisms at systems, cellular, and molecular levels for better understanding of the impact of climate change on epilepsy. Further focussed data would help us to develop evidence for mitigation methods to do more to protect people with epilepsy from the effects of climate change.","Gulcebi, Medine I; Bartolini, Emanuele; Lee, Omay; Lisgaras, Christos Panagiotis; Onat, Filiz; Mifsud, Janet; Striano, Pasquale; Vezzani, Annamaria; Hildebrand, Michael S; Jimenez-Jimenez, Diego; Junck, Larry; Lewis-Smith, David; Scheffer, Ingrid E; Thijs, Roland D; Zuberi, Sameer M; Blenkinsop, Stephen; Fowler, Hayley J; Foley, Aideen; Sisodiya, Sanjay M",Epilepsy Behav,225,21

The present review is focused on inflammatory and autoimmune thyroid complications triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection by searching through databases like MEDLINE and Scopus up to April 2021. AREAS COVERED: Beside the occurrence of ""non-thyroidal illness"" in severe clinical conditions, alterations of thyroid function and structure may occur during COVID-19 as a consequence of either direct or indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a receptor to infect the host cells and ACE2 is highly expressed by follicular thyroid cells. On the other hand, COVID-19 is associated with a systemic inflammatory and immune response, involving Th1/Th17/Th2 lymphocytes and proinflammatory cytokines, which resembles, at least in part, the immune activation that occurs in immune-mediated thyroid diseases. COVID-19-related thyroid disorders include destructive thyroiditis and onset or relapse of autoimmune thyroid disorders, leading to a broad spectrum of thyroid dysfunction ranging from thyrotoxicosis to hypothyroidism, that may worsen COVID-19 clinical course and affect prognosis. EXPERT OPINION: Physicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of thyroid dysfunction during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to evaluate potential long-term sequelae.","Ruggeri, Rosaria M; Campennì, Alfredo; Deandreis, Desiree; Siracusa, Massimiliano; Tozzoli, Renato; Petranovic Ovcaricek, Petra; Giovanella, Luca",Expert rev. clin. immunol,225,1

Since its outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 has had a major impact on clinical diagnostic laboratories. The scientific community has quickly risen to the occasion and reports of new developments have arrived at an unprecedented scale. At present, there is a growing list of over 400 SARC-CoV-2 diagnostic tests either in development or approved for clinical use. This presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing COVID- 19 in microbiology laboratories and also provides an insight into the future diagnostics approaches. METHODS: Proper respiratory specimen collected at the appropriate time and from the right anatomical site is critical in the accurate and timely diagnosis of SARSCoV2. While oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs are recommended for the detection of early infection, other lower respiratory tract specimens like the sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage are used for late detection and monitoring of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Real-time RT-PCR based molecular assay remains the test of choice for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 while serological tests are being introduced as supplementary tools. Finally, there is an urgent need for scaling up the diagnostic capacity by the introduction of reliable and accurate point-of-care tests which will assist in effective control of this outbreak. These assays can be used in the local hospitals and clinics bearing the burden of identifying and treating patients.","Sidiq, Zeeshan; Hanif, M; Dwivedi, Kaushal Kumar; Chopra, K K",Indian J Tuberc,225,26

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had a delayed onset in America. Despite the time advantage for the implementation of preventative measures to contain its spread, the pandemic followed growth rates that paralleled those observed before in Europe. Objectives: To analyze the temporal and geographical distribution of the COVID-19 pandemic at district-level in Perú during the full lockdown period in 2020. Methods: Analysis of publicly available data sets, stratified by altitude and geographical localization. Correlation tests of COVID-19 case and death rates to population prevalence of comorbidities. Results: We observe a strong protective effect of altitude from COVID-19 mortality in populations located above 2,500 m. We provide evidence that internal migration through a specific land route is a significant factor progressively overriding the protection from COVID-19 afforded by high altitude. This protection is independent of poverty indexes and is inversely correlated with the prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Discussion: Long-term adaptation to residency at high altitude may be the third general protective factor from COVID-19 severity and death, after young age and female sex. Multisystemic adaptive traits or acclimatization processes in response to chronic hypobaric hypoxia may explain the apparent protective effect of high altitude from COVID-19 death.","Thomson, Timothy M; Casas, Fresia; Guerrero, Harold Andre; Figueroa-Mujíca, Rómulo; Villafuerte, Francisco C; Machicado, Claudia",High Alt Med Biol,225,16

DESIGN: Guided by the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, virtual focus groups were conducted in five urban and rural Alabama communities using secure Zoom meetings. Community residents and stakeholders (N = 36 total) participated; meetings were audio- and video-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed according to Thematic Analysis. Themes were organized by the PRECEDE portion of the model in Predisposing, Reinforcing, and Enabling barriers and facilitators in three focus areas: prevention, coping, and testing. RESULTS: Prevention barriers included apathy, difficulty with social distancing, lack of information, mixed messages from authority figures, and lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). Prevention facilitators included concerns about contracting COVID-19, clear and consistent messages from trusted sources, contact tracing, and the provision of PPE. Coping barriers included food insecurity, mental health issues, isolation, economic hardships, lack of health care access, and issues with virtual schooling and church services, which were exacerbated by the inability to connect to the internet. Facilitators to coping included religious faith, increased physical activity, and a sense of hope.

461484,461484,461484,Life after COVID-19: a better normal?,20.459051,1.4876006,2020,"There is pressing urgency to understand the pathogenesis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus clade 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the disease COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and in concert with host proteases, principally transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), promotes cellular entry. The cell subsets targeted by SARS-CoV-2 in host tissues and the factors that regulate ACE2 expression remain unknown. Here, we leverage human, non-human primate, and mouse single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets across health and disease to uncover putative targets of SARS-CoV-2 among tissue-resident cell subsets. We identify ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells within lung type II pneumocytes, ileal absorptive enterocytes, and nasal goblet secretory cells. Strikingly, we discovered that ACE2 is a human interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) in vitro using airway epithelial cells and extend our findings to in vivo viral infections. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could exploit species-specific interferon-driven upregulation of ACE2, a tissue-protective mediator during lung injury, to enhance infection.","Ziegler, Carly G K; Allon, Samuel J; Nyquist, Sarah K; Mbano, Ian M; Miao, Vincent N; Tzouanas, Constantine N; Cao, Yuming; Yousif, Ashraf S; Bals, Julia; Hauser, Blake M; Feldman, Jared; Muus, Christoph; Wadsworth, Marc H; Kazer, Samuel W; Hughes, Travis K; Doran, Benjamin; Gatter, G James; Vukovic, Marko; Taliaferro, Faith; Mead, Benjamin E; Guo, Zhiru; Wang, Jennifer P; Gras, Delphine; Plaisant, Magali; Ansari, Meshal; Angelidis, Ilias; Adler, Heiko; Sucre, Jennifer M S; Taylor, Chase J; Lin, Brian; Waghray, Avinash; Mitsialis, Vanessa; Dwyer, Daniel F; Buchheit, Kathleen M; Boyce, Joshua A; Barrett, Nora A; Laidlaw, Tanya M; Carroll, Shaina L; Colonna, Lucrezia; Tkachev, Victor; Peterson, Christopher W; Yu, Alison; Zheng, Hengqi Betty; Gideon, Hannah P; Winchell, Caylin G; Lin, Philana Ling; Bingle, Colin D; Snapper, Scott B; Kropski, Jonathan A; Theis, Fabian J",Cell,225,1

Early restrictions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic included the closure of schools and physical activity (PA) amenities across the US. This study aimed to examine the impact of the pandemic on the PA and play behavior of U.S. children and to provide evidence-based recommendations to improve their PA. METHODS: A cross-sectional, online, parent-reported survey was conducted of children aged 3-18 years between April and June 2020 to assess light PA and MVPA using a modified Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. Additional items included family/child socioeconomic demographics, child adaptability to the pandemic, and community access. The survey was shared through social media and snowball sampling distribution. RESULTS: Analysis of 1310 surveys indicated child PA scores declined significantly during the pandemic (from 56.6 to 44.6, max 119, p < 0.001). Specifically, MVPA score decreased (from 46.7 to 34.7, max 98, p < 0.001) while light PA remained the same.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 actively replicates in the throat, unlike SARS-CoV, and shows high pharyngeal viral shedding even in patients with mild symptoms of the disease. HCoV-229E is one of four coronaviruses causing the common cold. In this study, the efficacy of ColdZyme® (CZ-MD), a medical device mouth spray, was tested against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E in vitro. The CZ-MD provides a protective glycerol barrier containing cod trypsin as an ancillary component. Combined, these ingredients can inactivate common cold viruses in the throat and mouth. The CZ-MD is believed to act on the viral surface proteins that would perturb their entry pathway into cells. The efficacy and safety of the CZ-MD have been demonstrated in clinical trials on the common cold. METHOD OF STUDY: The ability of the CZ-MD to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E was tested using an in vitro virucidal suspension test (ASTM E1052). RESULTS: CZ-MD inactivated SARS-CoV-2 by 98.3% and HCoV-229E by 99.9%. CONCLUSION: CZ-MD mouth spray can inactivate the respiratory coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E in vitro. Although the in vitro results presented cannot be directly translated into clinical efficacy, the study indicates that CZ-MD might offer a protective barrier against SARS-CoV-2 and a decreased risk of COVID-19 transmission.","Gudmundsdottir, Ágústa; Scheving, Reynir; Lindberg, Fredrik; Stefansson, Bjarki",J Med Virol,225,24

The latter suggests the presence of a possible sex-dependent susceptibility. An enzymatic system involved in this different predisposition could be represented by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is activated and down-regulated by the spike protein of the virus and allows the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into epithelial cells and myocardium. Data on the experimental animal have shown that 17ß-estradiol increases the expression and activity of ACE2 in both adipose tissue and kidney. Spontaneously hypertensive male mice have a higher myocardial ACE2 expression than females and its levels decrease after orchiectomy. In addition to this first aspect, the recent evidence of an increased frequency of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 (a clinical element associated with a worse prognosis) calls the attention on the safety of treatment with testosterone, in particular in hypogonadal men with greater genetic predisposition. Evidence that sex hormones are able to modulate the expression of ACE2 could help in interpreting epidemiological results and in designing more appropriate intervention strategies. Moreover, the vitamin D deficiency in elderly men may be worthy of further study regarding the epidemiological aspects of this different susceptibility and lethality between sexes.","La Vignera, Sandro; Cannarella, Rossella; Condorelli, Rosita A; Torre, Francesco; Aversa, Antonio; Calogero, Aldo E",,225,21

In the area surrounding Pavia during the critical stage of the outbreak (Mar-Apr 2020), 1,225 of the documented 4,200 deaths were related to coronavirus disease 2019 infection, with a mortality rate of 181/100,000 inhabitants and an increase in deaths of 138% compared with the same period during previous years. Our aim was to report the experience of the Department of Vascular Surgery of Pavia (Lombardy, Italy), including the lessons learned and future perspectives regarding the management of coronavirus disease 2019 patients who developed severe acute ischemia with impending lower limb loss or deep vein thrombosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective data collection of coronavirus disease 2019 patients with severe acute ischemia of the lower limbs or deep vein thrombosis, which we observed in our department during the period March 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020. Primary outcomes of the analysis were postoperative mortality for all patients and amputation rates only in those coronavirus disease 2019 patients suffering from acute lower limb ischemia. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of the disease among admitted coronavirus disease 2019 patients, and any possible correlation among inflammatory parameters, thrombolytic status, and the presence of acute ischemia or deep vein thrombosis. RESULTS: We observed 38 patients (28 male) with severe coronavirus disease 2019 infection (6 with lower limb arterial thrombosis and 32 with deep vein thrombosis). The median patient age was 64 years (range 30-94 y). In the arterial group, 3 had thrombosis on plaque and 3 on healthy arteries (""simple"" arterial thrombosis). All underwent operative or hybrid (open/endo) revascularization; 1 patient died from major organ failure and 1 patient underwent major amputation. In the deep vein thrombosis group, 9 (28%) patients died from major organ failure, despite aggressive medical therapy. In patients with simple arterial thrombosis and those with deep vein thrombosis, we observed a decrease in inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein) and in D-dimer and fibrinogen after aggressive therapy (P <.001). CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that critically ill, coronavirus disease 2019 patients who develop arterial and deep vein thrombosis have a high risk of mortality, but, if treated properly, there is an improvement in overall survival, especially in patients of 60 years of age or younger.","Bozzani, Antonio; Arici, Vittorio; Tavazzi, Guido; Franciscone, Mila Maria; Danesino, Vittorio; Rota, Monica; Rossini, Rosa; Sterpetti, Antonio V; Ticozzelli, Giulia; Rumi, Elisa; Mojoli, Francesco; Bruno, Raffaele; Ragni, Franco",Surgery,225,18

This study examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on PA and sedentary behavior (SB) in U.S. children. METHOD: Parents and legal guardians of U.S. children (ages 5-13) were recruited through convenience sampling and completed an online survey between April 25-May 16, 2020. Measures included an assessment of their child's previous day PA and SB by indicating time spent in 11 common types of PA and 12 common types of SB for children. Parents also reported perceived changes in levels of PA and SB between the pre-COVID-19 (February 2020) and early-COVID-19 (April-May 2020) periods. Additionally, parents reported locations (e.g., home/garage, parks/trails, gyms/fitness centers) where their children had performed PA and their children's use of remote/streaming services for PA. RESULTS: From parent reports, children (N = 211) (53% female, 13% Hispanic, Mage = 8.73 [SD = 2.58] years) represented 35 states and the District of Columbia. The most common physical activities during the early-COVID-19 period were free play/unstructured activity (e.g., running around, tag) (90% of children) and going for a walk (55% of children). Children engaged in about 90 min of school-related sitting and over 8 h of leisure-related sitting a day. Parents of older children (ages 9-13) vs. younger children (ages 5-8) perceived greater decreases in PA and greater increases in SB from the pre- to early-COVID-19 periods. Children were more likely to perform PA at home indoors or on neighborhood streets during the early- vs. pre-COVID-19 periods. About a third of children used remote/streaming services for activity classes and lessons during the early-COVID-19 period. CONCLUSION: Short-term changes in PA and SB in reaction to COVID-19 may become permanently entrenched, leading to increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in children. Programmatic and policy strategies should be geared towards promoting PA and reducing SB over the next 12 months.","Dunton, Genevieve F; Do, Bridgette; Wang, Shirlene D",BMC Public Health,225,16

METHODS: The electronic database of Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies. A meta-analysis of eligible studies that reported the prevalence of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in COVID-19 was performed. The incidences of AKI were compared between severe versus non-severe patients and survivors versus non-survivors. RESULTS: A total of 24 studies involving 4963 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. The proportions of patients with elevation of sCr and BUN levels were 9.6% (95% CI 5.7-13.5%) and 13.7% (95% CI 5.5-21.9%), respectively. Of all patients, 57.2% (95% CI 40.6-73.8%) had proteinuria, 38.8% (95% CI 26.3-51.3%) had proteinuria +, and 10.6% (95% CI 7.9-13.3%) had proteinuria ++ or +++. The overall incidence of AKI in all COVID-19 patients was 4.5% (95% CI 3.0-6.0%), while the incidence of AKI was 1.3% (95% CI 0.2-2.4%), 2.8% (95% CI 1.4-4.2%), and 36.4% (95% CI 14.6-58.3%) in mild or moderate cases, severe cases, and critical cases, respectively. Meanwhile, the incidence of AKI was 52.9%(95% CI 34.5-71.4%), 0.7% (95% CI - 0.3-1.8%) in non-survivors and survivors, respectively. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was required in 5.6% (95% CI 2.6-8.6%) severe patients, 0.1% (95% CI - 0.1-0.2%) non-severe patients and 15.6% (95% CI 10.8-20.5%) non-survivors and 0.4% (95% CI - 0.2-1.0%) survivors, respectively. CONCLUSION: The incidence of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in COVID-19 was high and AKI is closely associated with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, it is important to increase awareness of kidney dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.","Yang, Xianghong; Jin, Yiyang; Li, Ranran; Zhang, Zhongheng; Sun, Renhua; Chen, Dechang",Crit Care,225,16

Dalbavancin is a novel antibiotic with a long plasmatic half-life and simplified weekly administration regimens, thus representing a promising option for the outpatient treatment of Gram-positive infections and the early discharge of hospitalized patients. Dalbavancin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs). Many preliminary data seem to support its use in other indications, such as osteomyelitis, prosthetic joint infections, and infective endocarditis. AREAS COVERED: A search in the literature using validated keywords (dalbavancin, Gram-positive infections, Gram-positive cocci, ABSSSI, intravenous treatment, and long-acting antibiotics) was conducted on biomedical bibliographic databases (PubMed and Embase) from 2004 to 30 September 2020. Results were analyzed during two consensus conferences with the aim to review the current evidence on dalbavancin in Gram-positive infections, mainly ABSSSI, osteomyelitis, and infective endocarditis, highlight the main limitations of available studies and suggest possible advantages of the molecule. EXPERT OPINION: The board identifies some specific subgroups of patients with ABSSSIs who could mostly benefit from a treatment with dalbavancin and agrees that the design of homogenous and robust studies would allow a broader use of dalbavancin even in other clinical settings.","Andreoni, Massimo; Bassetti, Matteo; Corrao, Salvatore; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Esposito, Vincenzo; Falcone, Marco; Grossi, Paolo; Pea, Federico; Petrosillo, Nicola; Tascini, Carlo; Venditti, Mario; Viale, Pierluigi",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,225,26

We therefore share some critical knowledge and practice areas for radiological suspicion and diagnosis. In addition, emphasis on how guarding against healthcare acquired infections (HAIs) by applying ""red"" and ""green"" principle is addressed. Given that pandemics such as COVID-19 can worsen the strain on the scantily available radiological resources in this region, we share some practical points that can be applied to manage these precious resources also needed for other essential services. We have noted that radiology does not feature in many main COVID-19 guidelines, regionally and internationally.

The most common cause of SMAS is known as rapid and significant weight loss. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 61-year-old man who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and maintained a stable diet before admission. When the patient re-started feeding by gastrostomy tube after 5 days of therapeutic fasting due to gastric ulcer caused by gastrostomy tube irritation, he presented postprandial vomiting, abdominal distention, and tachycardia. Since fasting, his weight has been reduced by about 3âkg. DIAGNOSIS: Based on clinical symptoms and radiological findings, diagnose of SMAS was finally made. Abdomen computed tomography confirmed decreased aortomesenteric distance and tubography confirmed gastric and proximal duodenum distension above the compressed part. INTERVENTIONS: We performed jejunal tube insertion and the amount of feeding through the jejunal tube was gradually increased while maintaining parenteral nutrition. OUTCOMES: The presenting symptoms of the patient gradually improved. Follow-up abdomen computed tomography and tubography showed improvement in duodenal narrowing and stomach distension. CONCLUSION: SMAS should be considered when there is an abrupt observation of symptom of gastrointestinal obstruction in patients with predisposing condition such as a low body weight, even if the weight loss is relatively small.","Kang, Dong-Ha; Baik, Sung Woon; Won, Yu Hui; Ko, Myoung-Hwan",Medicine (Baltimore),225,17

Standard molecular diagnostic laboratory equipment, and commercially available centrifugal filters, RNA isolation kits and SARS Cov2 PCR tests were used. The basic idea was to combine and concentrate several samples to the maximal volume, which can be extracted with the single extraction column. Out of 16 tested pools, 12 were positive with cycle threshold (Ct) values within 0.5 and 3.01 Ct of the original individual specimens. The analysis of 112 specimens determined that 12 pools were positive, followed by identification of 6 positive individual specimens among the 112 tested. This testing was accomplished with the use of 16 extractions/PCR tests, resulting in saving of 96 reactions but adding the 40 centrifugal filters. The present study demonstrated that pool testing could detect even up to a single positive sample with Ct value as high as 34.

In the process of diagnosing COVID-19 and treating patients, automatic COVID-19 lesion segmentation from computed tomography images helps doctors and patients intuitively understand lung infection. To effectively quantify lung infections, a convolutional neural network for automatic lung infection segmentation based on deep learning is proposed. METHOD: This new type of COVID-19 lesion segmentation network is based on a U-Net backbone. First, a coarse segmentation network is constructed to extract the lung areas. Second, in the encoding and decoding process of the fine segmentation network, a new soft attention mechanism, namely the dilated convolutional attention (DCA) mechanism, is introduced to enable the network to focus on better quantitative information to strengthen the network's segmentation ability in the subtle areas of the lesions. RESULTS: The experimental results show that the average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and area under the curve of DUDA-Net are 87.06%, 90.85%, 99.59% and 0.965, respectively. In addition, the introduction of a cascade U-shaped network scheme and DCA mechanism can improve the DSC by 24.46% and 14.33%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The proposed DUDA-Net approach can automatically segment COVID-19 lesions with excellent performance, which indicates that the proposed method is of great clinical significance. In addition, the introduction of a coarse segmentation network and DCA mechanism can improve the COVID-19 segmentation performance.","Xie, Feng; Huang, Zheng; Shi, Zhengjin; Wang, Tianyu; Song, Guoli; Wang, Bolun; Liu, Zihong",Int. j. comput. assist. radiol. surg.

Recently, it has been shown that wearing face masks impairs social interaction by diminishing a person's ability to read the emotion of their counterparts, an essential prerequisite to respond adequately in social situations. It is easily conceivable that this may have a tangible negative influence on the communication and relationship between patients and healthcare personnel. We therefore investigated whether it has an effect on how patients perceive healthcare professionals when physicians and nursing staff wear portrait photos with their smiling faces in addition to face masks. METHODS: During the study period of 16 days, the medical staff of our Department wore surgical face masks at all times during any kind of interaction with patients. In a pseudorandomized order, all members of our staff additionally affixed their portrait photos to their work clothes on 8 of the 16 days. After completion of their visit, 226 patients were interviewed anonymously in a cross-sectional study design using a questionnaire in which they rated the following three items: friendliness of staff, medical quality of treatment, and how well they felt taken care of during treatment in our Department. RESULTS: On days, on which staff wore photos, mean scores of the questionnaires were significantly higher than on non-photo days (p = 0.013; mean ± standard deviation = 92.8 ± 11.3 vs. 91.0 ± 12.6; median (range) = 97 (98) vs. 96 (76)). When analyzed separately, the increased scores were only significant for the item friendliness of staff (p = 0.009; mean ± standard deviation = 95.8 ± 6.3 vs. 92.2 ± 11.5; median (range) = 98 (39) vs. 97 (54)).

No treatment effects (p > 0.05) were observed in the microbial richness at the family level estimated by Chao1 and the biodiversity assessed by Simpson's index, except for Shannon's index (p < 0.05). The intestinal microbiota was dominated by members of the order Clostridiales and Lactobacillales, followed by the families Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Lactobacillaceae, regardless of treatment. When the controls were compared, in the challenged control group there was an increase in Erysipelotrichaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Peptostreptococcaceae, and a decrease in Ruminococcaceae. Similar results were found for a challenged group that received monensin, while the blend partially mitigated this variation.

In this study, deep learning is selected as a powerful tool for forecasting this epidemic in Isfahan. A combination of effective Social Determinant of Health (SDH) and the occurrences of COVID-19 data are used as spatiotemporal input by using time-series information from different locations. Different models are utilized, and the best performance is found to be for a tailored type of long short-term memory (LSTM). This new method incorporates the mutual effect of all classes (confirmed/ death / recovered) in the prediction process. The future trajectory of the outbreak in Isfahan is forecasted with the proposed model. The paper demonstrates the positive effect of adding SDHs in pandemic prediction. Furthermore, the effectiveness of different SDHs is discussed, and the most effective terms are introduced. The method expresses high ability in both short- and long- term forecasting of the outbreak. The model proves that in predicting one class (like the number of confirmed cases), the effect of other accompanying numbers (like death and recovered cases) cannot be ignored. In conclusion, the superiorities of this model (particularity the long term predication ability) turn it into a reliable tool for helping the health decision-makers.","Kafieh, Rahele; Saeedizadeh, Narges; Arian, Roya; Amini, Zahra; Serej, Nasim Dadashi; Vaezi, Atefeh; Javanmard, Shaghayegh Haghjooy",Chaos Solitons Fractals,225,20

Studies showed that health professionals had psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, stress, among others. Objectives: To investigate the quality of sleep and the prevalence rate of sleeping disorders among physicians during COVID-19 pandemic, and identify the psychological and social factors associated with the condition. Methods: A cross-sectional study of an online questionnaire was applied for physicians in Brazil. Among the 332 participants included, 227 were women. Sociodemographic assessment was used in the questionnaire, as well as the scale of impact on the events of modifications caused by COVID-19, assessment on sleep quality (PSQI), presence and severity of insomnia (ISI), depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), and anxiety (GAD-7). Results: Most physicians (65.6%) had changes in sleep. Poor sleep quality was reported by 73.1%, depressive symptoms were present in 75.8%, and anxiety in 73.4%. Conclusion: Our study found that more than 70% of the physicians assessed had impaired sleep quality, characterizing insomnia symptoms during COVID-19 outbreak. Related factors included an environment of isolation, concerns about COVID-19 outbreak and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Special interventions are needed to promote health professionals' mental well-being and implement changes in this scenario.","Brito-Marques, Janaína Mariana de Araújo Miranda; Franco, Clélia Maria Ribeiro; Brito-Marques, Paulo Roberto de; Martinez, Sandra Cristina Gonçalves; Prado, Gilmar Fernandes do",Arq. neuropsiquiatr,225,29

In this paper, we use wavelet transformation and spectral methods to analyze the contents of image classification datasets, extract specific patterns from the datasets and find the associations between patterns and classes. We show that each image can be written as the summation of a finite number of rank-1 patterns in the wavelet space, providing a low rank approximation that captures the structures and patterns essential for learning. Regarding the studies on memorization vs learning, our results clearly reveal disassociation of patterns from classes, when images are randomly labeled. Our method can be used as a pattern recognition approach to understand and interpret learnability of these datasets.

In Bangladesh, rate of new infection has been on the rise despite limited testing facility. Constraint of resources in the healthcare sector makes the fight against Covid more challenging for a developing country like Bangladesh. Vascular surgeons find themselves in a precarious situation while delivering professional services during this crisis. With the limited number of dedicated vascular surgeons in Bangladesh, it is important to safeguard these professionals without compromising emergency vascular care services in the long term. To this end, we, at the National Institute of cardiovascular diseases and hospital (NICVD), Dhaka have developed a working guideline for our vascular surgeons to follow during the Covid-19 pandemic. The guideline takes into account high vascular work volume against limited resources in the country. METHODS: A total of 307 emergency vascular patients were dealt with in the first 4 Covid months (March through June, 2020) according to the working guideline and the results compared with the 4 pre-Covid months. Vascular trauma, dialysis access complications and chronic limb threatening ischemia formed the main bulk of the patient population. Vascular healthcare workers were regularly screened for Covid-19 infection. RESULTS: There was a 38% decrease in the number of patients in the Covid period. Treatment outcome in Covid months were comparable with that in the pre-Covid months except that limb loss in the CLTI patients was higher. Covid infection among the vascular healthcare professionals was low. CONCLUSION: Vascular surgery practice guideline customized for the high work volume and limited resources of NICVD was effective in delivering emergency care in during Covid-19 pandemic ensuring safety of the caregivers. Despite the fact that similar guidelines exist in different parts of the world, we believe that the present one is still relevant on the premises of a deepening Covid-19 crisis in a developing country like Bangladesh.","Bashar, Abul Hasan Muhammad; Hakim, Md Enamul; Rahman, Md Mokhlesur; Dey, Nirmal Kanti; Hasan, Minhazul; Islam, Md Moynul; Jamil, Md Saffait; Rahman, Md Mushfiqur; Islam, Md Faridul; Chandra Mandal, Naresh",Ann. vasc. surg,225,16

Underlying low-grade inflammation (LGI) has been theorized as one of its pathophysiological mechanisms. We aimed to investigate a possible relationship between PCS and an increase in inflammation markers, in a sex-stratified analysis. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODSMild cases of COVID-19 according to the WHO classification followed-up in a Primary Care Center, were included. We collected epidemiological data (age, sex, body mass index -BMI-, smoking, and comorbidities -Charlson index-), variables of the acute COVID-19 episode, and data at 3 months of follow-up (clinical manifestations and inflammatory markers). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels were analyzed. Low-grade inflammation (LGI) was defined as serum CRP between >0.3 and <1.0 mg/dL. Five composite indices were built combining the upper ranges of 4 markers. Bivariate and multivariate analyses (logistic regression and general linear models) were performed, stratified by sex. RESULTSWe analyzed 121 subjects with mild COVID-19 (56.2% women; mean age 46 years). The most common symptom in the acute episode was fever (60.3%), while it was fatigue in PCS (42.8%). Prevalence of PCS was 35.8% in women and 20.8% in men (p = 0.07). In women, after controlling for age, BMI, smoking, and comorbidities, the D1, D3, and D4 indices were consistently associated with PCS, with ORs of 5.14 (95% CI, 1.6-16.4), 4.20 (95% CI, 1.3-13.3), and 4.12 (95% CI, 1.3-13.1), respectively; in patients with post-COVID anosmia and ageusia, neutrophils were significantly elevated (3.43{+/-}0.3 vs 2.58{+/-}0.1; p = 0.014, and 3.89{+/-}0.3 vs 2.59{+/-}0.1; p = 0.002,respectively), after adjusting for confounders. In men, the D2 and D5 indices were associated with PCS, with adjusted ORs of 10.1 (95% CI, 1.2-85) and 17.5 (95% CI, 2-153), respectively. Furthermore, serum CRP in the LGI range was associated with PCS [adjusted OR=12.9 (95% CI, 1.3-121)], and in post-COVID persistent fatigue, the neutrophil count was significantly elevated (4.68{+/-}0.6 vs 3.37{+/-}0.1; p = 0.041), after controlling for confounders. CONCLUSIONSConsistent associations among PCS, anosmia, ageusia, and fatigue, with slight -but significant-elevated levels of inflammatory markers, have been observed. The neutrophil count was the most frequently involved marker.

The plugin offers the two said modules within the robust environment provided by a complete set of built-in tools for image processing available in ImageJ.

The aim of this study was to detect the contamination of hands, objects, and surfaces in isolation rooms and also in outpatients' clinics in hospitals and polyclinics. Environmental contamination of public high-touch surfaces in public facilities was also investigated during an active COVID-19 pandemic. Random swabs were also taken from public shops, pharmacies, bakeries, groceries, banknotes, and automated teller machines (ATMs). Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 positivity using real-time polymerase chain reaction. In the COVID-19 regional reference hospital, only 3 out of 20 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Hand swabs from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in isolation rooms were occasionally positive for viral RNA. In outpatients' clinics, door handles were the most contaminated surfaces. Dental chairs, sinks, keyboards, ophthalmoscopes, and laboratory equipment were also contaminated. Although no positive swabs were found in shops and public facilities, random ATM swabs returned a positive result for SARS-CoV-2. Although there is no longer a focus on COVID-19 wards and isolation hospitals, more attention is required to decontaminate frequently touched surfaces in health-care facilities used by patients not diagnosed with COVID-19.

The visible impact is not only on public health, but also influences the distribution and availability of various food supplies, especially local rice in the study area. The purpose of this study was to examine the flow patterns of the local rice supply chain during the Covid-19 pandemic. Data analysis using supply chain analysis of Supply Chain management (SCM). The results of the analysis show that at the farmer / producer level it does not significantly affect farming activities, only 29.77 percent of farmers stated that there was an influence on farming activities. The impact of Covid-19 mainly affects the level of intermediary institutions in the rice distribution process. Long product (material) flow patterns by business actors need to be shortened by a short distribution route. Another effect is the inaccuracy of product arrival time due to delays in the inspection process for products brought to the research location. The impact of Covid-19 is mainly felt by distributors / wholesalers who flow products to other areas, mainly due to the increase in additional costs related to Covid-19 requirements. The solution to integrate all SCM elements through an information system can facilitate the flow pattern of local rice in Kapuas District, by intensifying the management of information related to production at the producer level, as well as controlling rice supplies at the level of intermediary institutions. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

In the present study, the microstructures of the alloys were evaluated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The microhardness and uniaxial compression measurement were performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of the alloys. The electrochemical behaviors of the alloys was investigated in artificial saliva solution. The friction and wear performances of the Zr-25Ti-xMo alloys were examined by pin-on-disk under the load of 15 N. The results shows that the crystalline structure transforms from hexagonal close-pack (&#945; phase, x = 0 wt %) to body-centered cubic structure (ß phase, 5 &#8804; x &#8804; 12.5 wt %) through a &#945; + ß dual-phase region (x = 2.5 wt %). They exhibits excellent mechanical properties with low elastic modulus (from 17.7 to 24.4 GPa) and moderate compression strength (from 1154.4 to 1310.8 MPa). The Zr-25Ti-xMo alloys possess good corrosion resistance due to the formation of a protective passive film consisting mainly of ZrO2, TiO2 and minor MoO3. Especially, the polarization curves demonstrates that the Zr-25Ti-7.5Mo alloy has a wider passive region than the other five alloys and it possesses the lower corrosion current density and corrosion rate. Furthermore, this alloy exhibits good abrasion resistance with the lowest coefficients of friction and volume wear loss. Thus, the Zr-25Ti-7.5Mo alloy has a combination of excellent mechanical properties such as low elastic modulus, moderate yield strength and the compression strength, good electrochemical stability and well wear resistance, it is considered a promising candidate for orthopedic materials as dental implant.","Wei, Chengxia; Luo, Liying; Wu, Zhangxi; Zhang, Jiakai; Su, Shi; Zhan, Yongzhong",J Mech Behav Biomed Mater,225,16

History can teach us about the past, and today's pandemic is no exception. Without a vaccine available, three lessons from the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic may arm us in our fight against COVID-19. First, those who survived the first wave developed immunity to the second wave, highlighting the potential of passive immunity-based treatments like convalescent plasma and cell-based therapy. Second, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 are unknown. Slow-progressive cases of the Spanish flu have been linked to bacterial pneumonia and neurological disorders later in life, emphasizing the need to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Third, the Spanish flu killed approximately 17 to 50 million people, and the lack of human response, overcrowding, and poor hygiene were key in promoting the spread and high mortality.

METHODS: It is a prospective observational study. The study included healthy, not in labor, singleton pregnant women of 370/7-410/7 weeks who were applied to our hospital for routine obstetric control examination between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020. Patients were randomised by coin toss method. Oxygen saturation, systolic, and diastolic arterial blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature of pregnant women using surgical masks and respiratory masks were measured before and after the non-stress test. The tolerance of the masks was also evaluated. Student's t-test was used for variables showing parametric distribution and the Mann Whitney U-test was used for non-parametric tests. The categorical variables between the groups was analyzed by using the Chi square test or Fisher Exact test. The statistical significance level was taken as p<0.05 in all tests. RESULTS: A total of 297 pregnant women using masks were included in the study. The effect of mask type on oxygen saturation before and after the non-stress test was found to be significant (97.1±1.8 corresponds to 95.3±2.6 for the surgical mask, p=0.0001; 97.8±1.7 corresponds to 93.7±2.0 for the respiratory mask, p=0.0001).

The growing impact of emerging variants of concern increases the urgency for development of effective interventions. Since ACE2 is the critical SARS-CoV-2 receptor and all tested variants bind to ACE2, some even at much increased affinity (see accompanying paper), we hypothesized that aerosol administration of clinical grade soluble human recombinant ACE2 (APN01) will neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in the airways, limit spread of infection in the lung and mitigate lung damage caused by deregulated signaling in the renin-angiotensin (RAS) and Kinin pathways. Here we show that intranasal administration of APN01 in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection dramatically reduced weight loss and prevented animal death. As a prerequisite to a clinical trial, we evaluated both virus binding activity and enzymatic activity for cleavage of Ang II following aerosolization. We report successful aerosolization for APN01, retaining viral binding as well as catalytic RAS activity. Dose range-finding and IND-enabling repeat-dose aerosol toxicology testing were conducted in dogs. Twice daily aerosol administration for two weeks at the maximum feasible concentration revealed no notable toxicities. Based on these results, a Phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers can now be initiated, with subsequent Phase II testing in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This strategy could be used to develop a viable and rapidly actionable therapy to prevent and treat COVID-19, against all current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Social media platforms such as Twitter have been a critical tool in this process, providing a communication channel that allows both rapid dissemination of messages to the public at large and individual-level engagement. Message dissemination and amplification is a necessary precursor to reaching audiences, both online and off, as well as inspiring action. Therefore, it is valuable for organizational risk communication to identify strategies and practices that may lead to increased message passing among online users. In this research, we examine message features shown in prior disasters to increase or decrease message retransmission under imminent threat conditions to develop models of official risk communicators' messages shared online from February 1, 2020-April 30, 2020. We develop a lexicon of keywords associated with risk communication about the pandemic response, then use automated coding to identify message content and message structural features. We conduct chi-square analyses and negative binomial regression modeling to identify the strategies used by official risk communicators that respectively increase and decrease message retransmission. Findings show systematic changes in message strategies over time and identify key features that affect message passing, both positively and negatively. These results have the potential to aid in message design strategies as the pandemic continues, or in similar future events.","Sutton, Jeannette; Renshaw, Scott L; Butts, Carter T",PLoS One,225,16

To overcome this public health challenge, comprehensive understanding of the disease transmission is urgently needed. Recent evidences suggest that the most common route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2 is likely via droplet, aerosol, or direct contact in a person-to-person encounter, although the possibility of transmission via fomites from surfaces cannot be ruled out entirely. Environmental contamination in COVID-19 patient rooms is widely observed due to viral shedding from both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, and SARS-CoV-2 can survive on hospital surfaces for extended periods. Sequence of contact events can spread the virus from one surface to the other in a hospital setting. Here, we review the studies related to viral shedding by COVID-19 patients that can contaminate surfaces and survival of SARS-CoV-2 on different types of surfaces commonly found in healthcare settings, as well as evaluating the importance of surface to person transmission characteristics.

Multiple genetic and epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the onset and severity of SM. However, little is known to date about the metabolic underpinnings underlying SM aggressiveness, which has thus far impeded the development of strategies to leverage metabolic dependencies when existing KIT-targeted treatments fail. Here, we show that plasma metabolomic profiles were able to discriminate indolent from advanced forms of the disease. We identified N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) as the most predictive metabolite of SM severity. High plasma levels of GlcNAc in patients with advanced SM correlated with the activation of the GlcNAc-fed hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) in patients BM aspirates and purified BM MCs. At the functional level, GlcNAc enhanced human neoplastic MCs proliferation and promoted rapid health deterioration in a humanized mouse model of SM. In addition, in the presence of GlcNAc, immunoglobulin E-stimulated MCs triggered enhanced release of proinflammatory cytokines and a stronger acute response in a mouse model of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. Mechanistically, elevated GlcNAc levels promoted the transcriptional accessibility of chromatin regions that contain genes encoding mediators of receptor tyrosine kinases cascades and inflammatory responses, thus leading to a more aggressive phenotype. Therefore, GlcNAc is an oncometabolite driver of SM aggressiveness. This study suggests the therapeutic potential for targeting metabolic pathways in MC-related diseases to manipulate MCs effector functions.","Agopian, Julie; Da Costa, Quentin; Nguyen, Quang Vo; Scorrano, Giulia; Kousteridou, Paraskevi; Yuan, Min; Chelbi, Rabie; Goubard, Armelle; Castellano, Remy; Maurizio, Julien; Teodosio, Cristina; de Sepulveda, Paulo; Asara, John; Orfao, Alberto; Hermine, Olivier; Dubreuil, Patrice; Brenet, Fabienne",Blood,225,24

This study examines education changes spurred by COVID-19. METHODS: Data were collected via a Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance survey of family medicine clerkship directors. Participants answered questions about didactic and clinical changes made to clerkship teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic, how positive the changes were, whether the changes would be made permanent, and how prepared clerkship directors were for the changes. RESULTS: The response rate was 64%. The most frequent change made to didactic teaching was increasing online resources. The most frequent change made to clinical teaching was adding clinical simulation. Greater changes were made to clinical teaching than to didactic teaching. Changes made to didactic teaching were perceived as more positive for student learning than the changes made to clinical teaching. Clerkship directors felt more prepared for changes to didactic teaching than for clinical teaching, and were more likely to make the didactic teaching changes permanent than the clinical teaching changes. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic caused nearly all clerkship directors to make changes to clerkship teaching, but few felt prepared to make these changes, particularly changes to clinical teaching.

Transmission control according to official guidelines can be prevented by keeping a distance, wearing a mask and washing hands. Sharing a space with several members of the immediate or extended family increases the risk of transmission in all three ways. In Traditional Bosnian families two or three generations live in one household. The family doctor is informed with living conditions of the residents and has the opportunity to monitor the rate of secondary transmission from the index case, and then recommend additional preventative and treatment measures. Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the first occurrence of the symptoms and to monitor possible intrafamilial transmission of the disease through clinical examinations and microbiological-serological tests. Methods: The study was conducted in a family medicine clinic in the region of northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina from March to December 2020. Patients with symptoms that could indicate the presence of COVID-19 disease were registered. If COVID-19 was proven, the patient became an index case. The other members of the family would be monitored for the secondary transmission via laboratory (PCA SARS-CoV-2 and IgM and IgG antibodies) and clinical parameters. Results: Characteristics of 25 index cases were analyzed. All 25 of them were middle-aged men that worked outside the home. In 25 households, there was a total of 123 members that shared a home with the index patient. Secondary transmission developed in 76 out of 123 family members (61.8%). Only one patient had a severe form of the disease and was hospitalized. 2 patients died. Conclusion: Intrafamiliar transmission of Covid-19 in households of Bosnia and Herzegovina is high. The secondary attack rate of SARS- CoV-2 in households is 61,8%.

In this article, we report how the problem-solving sessions (recitations) and laboratories were adapted, how students' judge different formats of the courses and how useful and effective they perceive them. The results are correlated to the students' self-efficacy ratings and other behavioral measures (such as self-regulated learning skills) and demographics.

LMICs have significant experience implementing vaccination campaigns to respond to epidemic threats but are often hindered by chronic health system challenges. We sought to identify transferable lessons for COVID-19 vaccination from the rollout of three vaccines that targeted adult groups in Africa and South America: MenAfriVac (meningitis A); 17D (yellow fever); and rVSV-ZEBOV (Ebola virus disease). MethodsWe conducted a rapid literature review and 24 semi-structured interviews with technical experts who had direct implementation experience with the selected vaccines in Africa and South America. We identified barriers, enablers, and key lessons from the literature and from participants experiences. Interview data were analysed thematically according to seven implementation domains. ResultsParticipants highlighted multiple components of vaccination campaigns that are instrumental for achieving high coverage. Community engagement is an essential and effective tool, requiring dedicated time, funding and workforce. Involving local health workers is a key enabler, as is collaborating with community leaders to map social groups and tailor vaccination strategies to their needs. Vaccination team recruitment and training strategies need to be enhanced to support vaccination campaigns. Although recognised as challenging, integrating vaccination campaigns with other routine health services can be highly beneficial if well planned and coordinated across health programmes and with communities. ConclusionAs supplies of COVID-19 vaccines become available to LMICs, countries need to prepare to efficiently roll out the vaccine, encourage uptake among eligible groups, and respond to potential community concerns. Lessons from the implementation of these three vaccines that targeted adults in LMICs can be used to inform best practice for COVID-19 and other epidemic vaccination campaigns.

In addition to these established infections, new infectious diseases periodically emerge. In extreme cases they may cause pandemics such as COVID-19; in other cases, dead-end infections or smaller epidemics result. Established diseases may also re-emerge, for example by extending geographically or by becoming more transmissible or more pathogenic. Disease emergence reflects dynamic balances and imbalances, within complex globally distributed ecosystems comprising humans, animals, pathogens, and the environment. Understanding these variables is a necessary step in controlling future devastating disease emergences.","Morens, David M; Fauci, Anthony S",Cell,225,16

Hence, accurate and cheap portable sensors are crucially important for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as robust synthetic molecular recognition materials with antibody-like ability to bind and discriminate between molecules can perfectly serve in building selective elements in such sensors. Herein, we report for the first time on the development of a MIP-based electrochemical sensor for detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (ncovNP). A key element of the sensor is a disposable sensor chip - thin film electrode - interfaced with a MIP-endowed selectivity for ncovNP and connected with a portable potentiostat. The resulting ncovNP sensor showed a linear response to ncovNP in the lysis buffer up to 111 fM with a detection and quantification limit of 15 fM and 50 fM, respectively. Notably, the sensor was capable of signaling ncovNP presence in nasopharyngeal swab samples of COVID-19 positive patients.

Volatile organic compounds produced during respiratory infections can cause specific scent imprints, which can be detected by trained dogs with a high rate of precision. METHODS: Eight detection dogs were trained for 1 week to detect saliva or tracheobronchial secretions of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in a randomised, double-blinded and controlled study. RESULTS: The dogs were able to discriminate between samples of infected (positive) and non-infected (negative) individuals with average diagnostic sensitivity of 82.63% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.02-83.24%) and specificity of 96.35% (95% CI: 96.31-96.39%). During the presentation of 1012 randomised samples, the dogs achieved an overall average detection rate of 94% (±3.4%) with 157 correct indications of positive, 792 correct rejections of negative, 33 incorrect indications of negative or incorrect rejections of 30 positive sample presentations. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings indicate that trained detection dogs can identify respiratory secretion samples from hospitalised and clinically diseased SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals by discriminating between samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and negative controls. This data may form the basis for the reliable screening method of SARS-CoV-2 infected people.","Jendrny, Paula; Schulz, Claudia; Twele, Friederike; Meller, Sebastian; von Köckritz-Blickwede, Maren; Osterhaus, Albertus Dominicus Marcellinus Erasmus; Ebbers, Janek; Pilchová, Veronika; Pink, Isabell; Welte, Tobias; Manns, Michael Peter; Fathi, Anahita; Ernst, Christiane; Addo, Marylyn Martina; Schalke, Esther; Volk, Holger Andreas",BMC Infect Dis,225,16

519807,519807,519807,Mental health and legal education in the time of pandemic,20.426477,1.6678447,2021,"AIMS: The recent emergence of novel, pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a global health emergency. The coronaviral entry requires the spike (S)-protein for attachment to the host cell surface, and employs human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for entry and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for S-protein priming. Although coronaviruses undergo evolution by mutating themselves, it is also essential to know the host genetic factors. Here, we describe the single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in human ACE2 and TMPRSS2. METHODS: The genetic variants derived from five population-sequencing projects were classified by variant type, allele frequency (AF), ethnic group and estimated pathogenicity. The SNVs in SARS-CoV-2/hACE2 contact residues were investigated. The genetic variability was normalised using non-linear regression and the total number of SNVs was estimated by the derived formulas. RESULTS: We detected 349 and 551 SNVs in ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively, in a total of 156 513 individuals. The vast majority (>97%) of the SNVs were very rare (AF <0.1%) and population-specific, and were computationally estimated to be more frequently deleterious than the SNVs with high AF. These SNVs were distributed throughout the coding regions; some ACE2 variants were located in the SARS-CoV-2/hACE2 contact residues, with a hemizygous state occurring in males. Using regression analysis, the total numbers of genetic variations in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were 1.1×103 and 1.5×103, respectively, for a population of one million people. CONCLUSION: The majority of SNVs in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are rare, population-specific and deleterious, and a multitude of very rare SNVs may explain different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.","Fujikura, Kohei; Uesaka, Kazuma",J Clin Pathol,225,1

We investigated the brain morphometry and memory performance modifications within the same group of severe non-missile traumatic brain injury patients (nmTBI) after about â¼1 year and at â¼ 9 years from the head trauma. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measurements were carried out with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to determine changes in the cerebral grey and white matter (GM and WM). Contemporarily memory tests were also administered. In comparison with normal control subjects, nmTBI patients showed a significant reduction in the GM and WM after â¼1 year; conversely â¼9 years after the neuropathological event, neurodegenerative changes spared the GM, but a prominent loss was detected in the WM, such as the superior longitudinal fasciculi, the body of the corpus callosum, the optic radiation and the uncinate fasciculus. Memory performance at â¼1 year in comparison with â¼9 years was stable with a subtle but significant trend towards recovery. These data demonstrate that nmTBI patients undergo neurodegenerative processes during the chronic stage affecting mainly the cerebral WM rather than GM. Despite these anatomical brain parenchyma losses, memory performance tends to be stable or even slightly recovered. These neuroanatomical results indicate the possible root for the cognitive disorders on survey traumatic brain injury patients and support new possible treatments to prevent long term WM degeneration of these patients.

Notably, due to both its high infective and pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause a severe sometimes fatal respiratory disease. A specific vaccine, which relies on the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 structural protein-derived antigenic peptides, is indispensable for restraining the spread and reducing the mortality of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infections activate cytototxic, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, as well as natural killer, B, helper T, and regulatory T cells, thus further stimulating innate and antigen-specific immune responses. Nevertheless, many immune effector cells cause hyperinflammation and pulmonary immunopathology by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interferon (IFN)-&#945;, IFN-ß, IFN-Î³, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1A, MIP1B, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12, IL-17, and IL-18, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, and induced protein 10. Interestingly, related products derived from SARS-CoV-2 are likely to trigger immune evasion. Therefore, investigating SARS-CoV-2-specific vaccines, blocking immunopathology, and prohibiting immune evasion are urgently required for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, we emphatically illuminated the development of a SARS-CoV-2-specific vaccine based on the analysis of epitopes, also expounding the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytokine release syndrome.

COVID-19 is a systemic viral disease currently spreading as a pandemic. Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 in patients with SLE. OBJECTIVE: to acquire information on the impact of COVID-19 in SLE. METHODS: A 26-item anonymous questionnaire investigating demographics, SLE clinical features, COVID-19 diagnoses and changes in treatments and daily habits was administered to patients with SLE from three referral centres through www.surveymonkey.com over 10 days. Data from the survey were compared to those from published estimates about the general population. RESULTS: Four-hundred-seventeen patients responded to the survey. More than 60% of subjects complained of symptoms that are also associated to COVID-19. Fourteen COVID-19 diagnoses (five confirmed by polymerase chain reaction) were reported, in contrast to a 0.73% prevalence of confirmed cases in Lombardy. One hospitalisation was reported. Fever, anosmia, dry cough, a self-reported history of neuropsychiatric SLE and a recent contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases were more strongly associated with COVID-19, as were symptoms and lower compliance to behavioural preventive measures in patients' contacts. No protective effect was seen in subjects on hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 morbidity might only moderately be increased in most patients with SLE, although limited information can be inferred on more severe cases. Hydroxychloroquine apparently seems not to confer protection to infection per se, although other beneficial roles cannot be excluded. Containment policies and behavioural preventive measures could have a major role in limiting the impact of COVID-19 in patients with SLE.","Ramirez, Giuseppe A; Gerosa, Maria; Beretta, Lorenzo; Bellocchi, Chiara; Argolini, Lorenza M; Moroni, Luca; Della Torre, Emanuel; Artusi, Carolina; Nicolosi, Selene; Caporali, Roberto; Bozzolo, Enrica P; Dagna, Lorenzo",Semin Arthritis Rheum,225,1

Economic growth and urbanisation greatly affect the livelihood of family households across the Pacific Island countries. These changes take place against a backdrop of increasing inequity, rapid growth in technology, changes in traditional employment structures and a changing climate. Key social indicators suggest that violence, abuse and exploitation of children in the Pacific Island nations challenge their most vulnerable and marginalised children (Save the Children, 2019). To make the Pacific safe for every child, a number of nations are developing legal and regulatory frameworks for children’s protection, with child and family welfare systems that address behaviour, attitudes and policies related to child protection concerns. This article examines key ‘grey’ literature drawn from UN, NGO and government documents, to offer an overview of what legal and welfare systems are in place in the Pacific Island nations in regard to child protection needs. It draws on Parton’s (Parton, International Journal on Child Maltreatment 3:19–34, 2020, p. 20) suggestion that a range of political, cultural and sociological influences shape child protection policies which vary according to both time and place and family and community values. What the literature uncovers is the challenges Pacific Island nations face implementing such legal and regulatory frameworks for children’s protection, what supports are needed to support any changes (UNICEF, 2015a, b), their need to address the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and to work with local communities, if there is to be effective reform around child wellbeing and safety, and their protection from harm (United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), 1989).","Sheehan, Rosemary",Int J Child Maltreat,225,22

We aimed to compare in-hospital mortality and other patient characteristics between the first and second waves of COVID-19. Methods: We analysed data from the DATCOV national active surveillance system for COVID-19 hospitalisations. We defined four wave periods using incidence risk for hospitalisation, pre-wave 1, wave 1, pre-wave 2 and wave 2. We compared the characteristics of hospitalised COVID-19 cases in wave 1 and wave 2, and risk factors for in-hospital mortality accounting for wave period using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Peak rates of COVID-19 cases, admissions and in-hospital deaths in the second wave exceeded the rates in the first wave (138.1 versus 240.1; 16.7 versus 28.9; and 3.3 versus 7.1 respectively per 100,000 persons). The weekly average incidence risk increase in hospitalisation was 22% in wave 1 and 28% in wave 2 [ratio of growth rate in wave two compared to wave one: 1.04, 95% CI 1.04-1.05]. On multivariable analysis, after adjusting for weekly COVID-19 hospital admissions, there was a 20% increased risk of in-hospital mortality in the second wave (adjusted OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.2-1.3). In-hospital case fatality-risk (CFR) increased in weeks of peak hospital occupancy, from 17.9% in weeks of low occupancy (<3,500 admissions) to 29.6% in weeks of very high occupancy (>12,500 admissions) (adjusted OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.5). Compared to the first wave, individuals hospitalised in the second wave, were more likely to be older, 40-64 years [OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.1] and [≥]65 years [OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.1-1.1] compared to <40 years; and admitted in the public sector [OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.7-2.8]; and less likely to have comorbidities [OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.5-0.5]. Conclusions: In South Africa, the second wave was associated with higher incidence and more rapid increase in hospitalisations, and increased in-hospital mortality.

We report here the epidemiological, clinical, radiological and laboratory findings of the first cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the tourists. METHODS: Information was collected on demographic details, travel and exposure history, comorbidities, timelines of events, date of symptom onset and duration of hospitalization from the 16 Italian tourists and an Indian with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical, laboratory, radiologic and treatment data was abstracted from their medical records and all tourists were followed up till their recovery or discharge or death. Throat and deep nasal swab specimens were collected on days 3, 8, 15, 18, 23 and 25 to evaluate viral clearance. RESULTS: A group of 23 Italian tourists reached New Delhi, India, on February 21, 2020 and along with three Indians visited several tourist places in Rajasthan. By March 3, 2020, 17 of the 26 (attack rate: 65.4%) had become positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these 17 patients, nine were symptomatic, while eight did not show any symptoms. Of the nine who developed symptoms, six were mild, one was severe and two were critically ill. The median duration between the day of confirmation for COVID-19 and RT-PCR negativity was 18 days (range: 12-23 days). Two patients died with a case fatality of 11.8 per cent.

Herbal medicine is also queried for potential supplementary treatments for COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the effects of Sugarcane, Black Myrobalan, and Mastic herbal medications for COVID-19 patients. Methods: This was a double-blinded randomized clinical trial study conducted over three months from May to July 2020 in patients admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 in Peymaniyeh Hospital in Jahrom, Iran. The intervention group received the treatment protocol approved by the Ministry of Health of Iran during the period of hospitalization and the herbal supplement obtained from the combination of black myrobalan and mastic and sugarcane, twice a day (3g of herbal supplements). All patients were compared in terms of demographic variables, vital signs, clinical and laboratory variables. Results: 72 patients with COVID-19, divided into intervention (n=37) and control (n=35) groups. intervention and control groups had not any significant difference in terms of baseline characteristics. The time-to-event analysis revealed a significant difference in 4 symptoms of cough, fever, dyspnea, and myalgia (P<0.05). The Control group had a significantly lower decrease in C-reactive protein during 7 days (P<0.05). Patients in the herbal supplement group were hospitalized for 4.12 days and in the control group were hospitalized for 8.37 days (P=0.001). ICU admission and death only happened in 3 (8.6%) patients of the control group.

This controlled cross‐sectional study was based on phone interviews of patients discharged from hospital after COVID‐19 compared to control group composed of individuals hospitalized during the same period due to non‐COVID‐19 causes. Patients were classifyed as having previous CP based on the ICD‐11/IASP criteria, de novo pain (i.e., any new type of pain, irrespective of the pain status before hospital stay), and de novo CP (i.e. persistent or recurring de novo pain, lasting more than 3 months) after COVID‐19. We asssessed pain prevalence and its characteristics, including headache profile, pain location, intensity, interference, and its relationship with fatigue, and persistent anosmia. Forty‐six COVID‐19 and 73 control patients were included. Both groups had similar sociodemographic characteristics and past medical history. Length of in‐hospital‐stay and ICU admission rates were significantly higher among COVID‐19 survivors, while mechanical ventilation requirement was similar between groups. Pre‐hospitalization pain was lower in COVID‐19 compared to control group (10.9% vs. 42.5%; P=0.001). However, COVID‐19 group had a significantly higher prevalence of de novo pain (65.2% vs. 11.0%, P=0.001), as well as more de novo headache (39.1%) compared to controls (2.7%, p=0.001). New‐onset CP was 19.6% in COVID‐19 patients and 1.4% (P=0.002) in controls. These differences remained significant (p=0.001) even after analyzing exclusively (COVID: n=40; controls: n=34) patients who did not report previous pain before hospital stay. No statistically significant differences were found for mean new‐onset pain intensity and interference with daily activities between both groups. COVID‐19 pain was more frequently located in the head/neck and lower limbs (P<0.05). New‐onset fatigue was more common in COVID‐19 survivors necessitating inpatient hospital care (66.8%) compared to controls (2.5%, p=0.001). COVID‐19 patients who reported anosmia had more new‐onset pain (83.3%) compared to those who did not (48.0%, P=0.024). COVID‐19 was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of de novo CP, chronic daily headache, and new‐onset pain in general, which was associated with persistent anosmia.","Soares, Felipe Henriques Carvalho; Kubota, Gabriel Taricani; Fernandes, Ana Mércia; Hojo, Bruno; Couras, Catarina; Costa, Bárbara Venturoti; da Silva Lapa, Jorge Dornellys; Braga, Luíza Mansur; de Almeida, Matheus Merula; da Cunha, Pedro Henrique Martins; Pereira, Vítor Hugo Honorato; de Morais, Adriano Donizeth Silva; Teixeira, Manoel Jacobsen; Ciampi de Andrade, Daniel",Eur J Pain,225,16

Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG can be helpful in identification of asymptomatic infections. We report baseline results of the CVOID-19 Contact (CoCo) Study, which follows 217 frontline healthcare workers at a university hospital and performs weekly SARS-CoV-2 specific serology (IgA/IgG). The majority of participants had direct contact to patients with infectious respiratory diseases. Study participants estimated their personal likelihood of having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection with a mean of 20.9% (range 0 to 90%). In contrast, anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG prevalence was in the range of 1-2% among health care workers. The CoCo Study is not fully representative for other hospitals and the sensitivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology in low prevalence conditions may require further improvement. Taken together, low rates of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG in healthcare workers in Northern Germany are in sharp contrast to the high personal risk perception. Regular anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing of health-care workers may aid in monitoring the pandemic, assessing the quality of immune responses, directing resources for protective measures, and assuring CVID-19 care in the long run.","Behrens, Georg MN; Cossmann, Anne; Stankov, Metodi V; Witte, Torsten; Ernst, Diana; Happle, Christine; Jablonka, Alexandra",,225,20

Further, due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage and stool samples, its transmission through water routes cannot be neglected. Thus, the efficient treatment of wastewater is a matter of utmost importance. The conventional wastewater treatment processes demonstrate a wide variability in absolute removal of viruses from wastewater, thereby posing a severe threat to human health and environment. The fate of SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater treatment plants and its removal during various treatment stages remains unexplored and demands immediate attention; particularly, where treated effluent is utilised as reclaimed water. Consequently, understanding the prevalence of pathogenic viruses in untreated/treated waters and their removal techniques has become the topical issue of the scientific community. The key objective of the present study is to provide an insight into the distribution of viruses in wastewater, as well as the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, and its possible transmission by the faecal-oral route. The review also gives a detailed account of the major waterborne and non-waterborne viruses, and environmental factors governing the survival of viruses. Furthermore, a comprehensive description of the potential methods (physical, chemical, and biological) for removal of viruses from wastewater has been presented. The present study also intends to analyse the research trends in microalgae-mediated virus removal and, inactivation. The review also addresses the UN SDG ‘Clean Water and Sanitation’ as it is aimed at providing pathogenically safe water for recycling purposes.","Bhatt, Ankita; Arora, Pratham; Prajapati, Sanjeev Kumar",J Environ Chem Eng,225,20

The treatment burden experienced by patients in a low-incidence setting where directly observed therapy is the standard of care is not well-known. METHODS: Patients receiving tuberculosis treatment through the chest clinic at a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia, participated in a semi-structured interview. The interviews explored the treatment burden experienced by patients and possible solutions to ameliorate this burden. Interviews were conducted until data saturation was achieved. They were recorded, transcribed and analysed using NVivo 12 software. RESULTS: Twenty participants (80% male, mean age 40 years) with pulmonary (n = 13) and extra-pulmonary (n = 7) tuberculosis were interviewed. Participants experienced healthcare, financial, social and medication burdens along with lifestyle changes due to treatment. Medication intake was challenging due to the high number of pills, and 55% (n = 11) of patients experienced fatigue amongst other side effects. Patients found clinic-based directly observed therapy inconvenient, especially those working and/or studying. Suggestions to lessen treatment burden included reducing medication burden and better access to health services. CONCLUSION: Tuberculosis treatment is associated with substantial treatment burden for patients. Measures to reduce treatment burden including alternative treatment delivery methods which are more accommodating to patients than clinic-based directly observed therapy, such as video directly observed therapy or partially self -administered treatment, should be considered on a case-by-case basis.","Ting, Natasha C.

We review studies that have exploited internet use and search trends to monitor two such diseases: influenza and dengue. Internet-based surveillance systems have good congruence with traditional surveillance approaches. Additionally, internet-based approaches are logistically and economically appealing. However, they do not have the capacity to replace traditional surveillance systems; they should not be viewed as an alternative, but rather an extension. Future research should focus on using data generated through internet-based surveillance and response systems to bolster the capacity of traditional surveillance systems for emerging infectious diseases.","Milinovich, Gabriel J; Williams, Gail M; Clements, Archie C A; Hu, Wenbiao",Lancet Infect Dis,225,23

Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were searched for studies published during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 outbreak. 44 articles were included in the review. Narrative synthesis showed that knowledge was largely based on expert assessments of prior bereavement research and professional experience; there is so far absence of empirical evidence linking features of COVID-19 bereavement situations to health outcomes. Severe negative consequences have been consistently predicted by authors. There is still relatively little consideration of positive or compensatory processes or the possibility that these could alleviate the effect of the shocking, traumatic circumstances. With two notable exceptions, there has been lack of attention to the role of theoretical models for guiding research and practice. A theoretical perspective (the Dual Process Model, DPM) was applied to the information derived from the available articles. Two features of the DPM framework illustrated its relevance: 1. It enables systematic assessment of the range of loss- and restoration-related challenges for the bereaved; 2. It speaks for extension of psychotherapeutic intervention to manage secondary, restoration- as well as primary, loss-oriented stressors; studies have demonstrated that this may increase the effectiveness of intervention.

METHODS: Annually, 890 to 1441 individuals were followed and contacted weekly to report ARIs. Specimens collected during illness were tested for human coronaviruses (HCoV) types OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63. RESULTS: In total, 993 HCoV infections were identified over 8 years, with OC43 most commonly seen and 229E the least. HCoVs were detected in a limited time period, between December and April/May, and peaked in January/February. Highest infection frequency was in children <5 years (18 per 100 person-years), with little variation in older age groups (range: 7 to 11 per 100 person-years).

Why are viruses more dangerous in one species than another? Immunological studies investigating quantitative and qualitative differences in the host-virus equilibrium in animal reservoirs will be key to answering this question, informing new approaches for treating and preventing zoonotic diseases. Integrating an understanding of host immune responses with epidemiological, ecological, and evolutionary insights into viral emergence will shed light on mechanisms that minimize fitness costs associated with viral infection, facilitate transmission to other hosts, and underlie the association of specific reservoir hosts with multiple emerging viruses. Reservoir host studies provide a rich opportunity for elucidating fundamental immunological processes and their underlying genetic basis, in the context of distinct physiological and metabolic constraints that contribute to host resistance and disease tolerance.","Mandl, Judith N.; Ahmed, Rafi; Barreiro, Luis B.; Daszak, Peter; Epstein, Jonathan H.; Virgin, Herbert W.; Feinberg, Mark B.",Cell,225,16

In spite of intense study, the immunological response to the infection is only partially understood. In addition to older age and ethnicity, patients with co-morbidities including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, malignancy, renal and pulmonary disease, may experience severe outcomes. Some patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies also appear to be at increased risk from COVID-19. In addition to their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2, patients with primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) often suffer from chronic pulmonary disease and may not respond to vaccines, exacerbating their long-term risks. Patients with Common Variable Immunodeficiency disorders (CVID), the most frequent symptomatic PID in adults and children, have a spectrum of B and T cell defects. It may be possible to stratify their risk of severe COVID-19 based on age, ethnicity, the severity of their T cell defect as well as the presence of other co-morbidities. Patients with CVID and other immunodeficiencies are at risk of chronic COVID-19, a dangerous stalemate between a suboptimal immune response and SARS-CoV-2. Intra-host viral evolution could result in the rapid emergence of vaccine resistant mutants and is a public health emergency. Vaccination and prevention of Chronic COVID-19 in immunodeficient patients is therefore of the highest priority. Having a reliable diagnostic assay for T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for evaluating responses to vaccines in these patients. New treatments such as NZACE2-Pātari for COVID-19, are likely to be of particular benefit to immunodeficient patients, especially those who fail to mount a robust T cell response to vaccines.","Ameratunga, Rohan; Longhurst, Hilary; Steele, Richard; Lehnert, Klaus; Leung, Euphemia; Brooks, Anna E.S.; Woon, See-Tarn",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,225,26

In 2015 and 2017, we invited passengers arriving at or departing from Pointe-à-Pitre international airport to answer an online health questionnaire during the four days following their arrival from or at Paris-Orly international airport. SPIRE 1 was intended for passengers arriving at Pointe-à-Pitre and was conceived as a pilot study. SPIRE 2 was an improved version of SPIRE 1 and consisted in three parts, which permitted to further assess the benefits of pre-flight request and email follow-up. Endpoints were the connection rates and response rates to online health questionnaire. Results. For SPIRE 1, 4/1,038 travelers (0.4%) completed the two steps of the online health questionnaire. In SPIRE 2, response rates ranged from 3/1,059 (0.3%) to 19/819 (2.3%). Response rates were significantly better when passengers were approached before their flight. Conclusions. The yield of an online health questionnaire was unexpectedly low.","Lefèvre, B; Blanchon, T; Saint-Martin, P; Tattevin, P; Che, D; Caumes, E; Pitel, T; Rossignol, L; Dournon, N; Duval, X; Hoen, B",Med Mal Infect,225,11

This included those working in children’s social care (CSC) who have responsibility for child protection and other safeguarding duties. OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to understand how CSC made the transition from being an office-based agency to one where the majority of social workers were based at home and to understand how CSC perceived the impact on children and their families. Participants and setting Senior members of CSC staff in 15 local authorities took part in the research in June 2020. METHODS: Nine interviews were conducted by video call, three by telephone, and three consisted of initial written responses that were then followed by telephone calls. RESULTS: Service delivery had been maintained across all the authorities with most visits being made virtually after assessments of risk had been conducted on all cases. Multiagency working had improved, with greater involvement of general practitioners and paediatricians. Overall activity in CSC had been lower than normal but as lockdown eased this was changing. Concerns were expressed about how to manage the response that would be required to meet the expected level of harm that had occurred but been hidden. CONCLUSIONS: Responses to COVID-19 prompted widespread innovation and it will be an imperative to evaluate which initiatives have worked for children and families, as well as practitioners, and which should be discarded, sustained or reshaped.","Baginsky, Mary; Manthorpe, Jill",Child Abuse Negl,225,16

Previous studies described the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, but knowledge gaps remain in the Middle East region. Identifying these features will help in mapping the disease and guiding pandemic management. A multi-center, retrospective cross-sectional study was initiated to describe the demographic data, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of COVID-19 cases across all the regions of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: The analysis included all laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 patients from the 1st of March 2020 to 31st of March 2020 across all regions of Saudi Arabia. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, incubation periods, laboratory findings, and patient outcomes data were retrieved from 1519 cases in the Health Electronic Surveillance Network Database. RESULTS: The median age was 36 years and 54.3% (n = 825) of the patients were men. Patients working in health care facilities represented 12.5% of the cases (n = 190) and 9.3% of cases were asymptomatic. The median incubation period was 6 days. The most common symptoms were cough (89.4%), fever (85.6%), and sore throat (81.6%); 20.1% of the patients had underlying comorbidities. Hypertension was seen in 8.8% and diabetes in 7.6% of all the cases. The percentage of cases with temperatures >38֯C was 20.3% (n = 129), and 1.6% of patients had heart rates ≥125 beats/min and 4.7% of them had respiratory rates of >24 breaths/min. Lymphocytopenia occurred in 37.5% of cases. Overall, 71.6% of patients were admitted to hospitals and 4.7% required ICU treatment. We could not completely assess the clinical courses or final outcomes of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: In this multi-center retrospective study, fever and cough were common symptoms. Special attention should be addressed toward asymptomatic carriers and workers in health care facilities as they play a key role in disease transmission.","Alsofayan, Yousef M; Althunayyan, Saqer M; Khan, Anas A; Hakawi, Ahmed M; Assiri, Abdullah M",J Infect Public Health,225,4

However, traditional phase 3 clinical trials are inefficient. They usually focus on addressing a single primary question, take a very long time to implement from conception to publication of findings, and are very costly. There is a need for improved designs for clinical trials to enable rapid, efficient and better evaluation of treatments; both a need to identify effective treatments, and equally important, to identify ineffective ones early, in order to direct resources to the most promising interventions. It is increasingly recognised that efficiencies could be gained by asking multiple questions in a single protocol. Adaptive platform trials with multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) designs offer a mechanism for the systematic evaluation of several investigational agents simultaneously and the abandonment of those that do not demonstrate sufficient activity, thereby significantly speed up the rate at which answers can be achieved. This talk will review some general features of adaptive Platform Trials, their advantages and challenges in their design and implementation in a pandemic setting, drawing from experience and lessons learned in conducting such trials in COVID-19.","Babiker, A.",Revue d'Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique,225,5

COVID-19 has amplified population health inequalities, and there is concern that people with SMI will be disproportionately affected. Understanding how health risk behaviours have changed during the pandemic is important when developing strategies to mitigate future increases in health inequalities. METHODS: We sampled from an existing cohort of people with SMI. Researchers contacted participants by phone or post to invite them to take part in a survey about how the pandemic had affected them. We asked people about their health risk behaviours and how these had changed during the pandemic. We created an index of changed behaviours, comprising dietary factors, smoking, lack of exercise, and drinking patterns. By creating data linkages, we compared their responses during pandemic restrictions to responses they gave prior to the pandemic. OUTCOMES: 367 people provided health risk data. The mean age of the participants was 50.5 (range = 20 to 86, SD ± 15.69) with 51.0% male and 77.4% white British. 47.5% of participants reported taking less physical activity during the pandemic and of those who smoke 54.5% reported smoking more heavily. Self-reported deterioration in physical health was significantly associated with an increase in health risk behaviours (adjusted OR for physical health 1.59, 95%CI 1.22–2.07; adjusted OR for Age 0.99, 95%CI 0.98–1.00). INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 is likely to amplify health inequalities for people with SMI. Health services should target health risk behaviours for people with SMI to mitigate the immediate and long lasting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Peckham, Emily; Allgar, Victoria; Crosland, Suzanne; Heron, Paul; Johnston, Gordon; Newbronner, Elizabeth; Spanakis, Panagiotis; Wadman, Ruth; Walker, Lauren; Gilbody, Simon",PLoS One,225,16

In the present study, we examined this involvement in human hepatoma cell lines using a human TLR signaling target RT-PCR array. We also observed that zinc chloride inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MAP2K3) expression, which could downregulate HAV replication in human hepatocytes. It is possible that zinc chloride may inhibit HAV replication in association with its inhibition of MAP2K3. In that regard, this study set out to determine whether MAP2K3 could be considered a modulating factor in the development of the HAV pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and its triggering of interferon-β production. Because MAP2K3 seems to play a role in antiviral immunity against HAV infection, it is a promising target for drug development. The inhibition of MAP2K3 may also prevent HAV patients from developing a severe hepatitis A infection.","Kanda, Tatsuo; Sasaki-Tanaka, Reina; Masuzaki, Ryota; Matsumoto, Naoki; Okamoto, Hiroaki; Moriyama, Mitsuhiko",Int J Mol Sci,225,12

An emerging concept is that genetic and non-genetic deficiencies in interferon system components lead to uncontrolled virus replication and severe illness in a subset of people. Intriguingly, new findings suggest that individuals with autoantibodies neutralizing the antiviral function of interferon are at increased risk of severe COVID-19.

Studies have reported that males and some ethnic groups are at increased risk of death from COVID-19, which implies that individual risk of death might be influenced by host genetic factors. METHODS: In this project, we consider the mortality as the trait of interest and perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of data for 1,778 infected cases (445 deaths, 25.03%) distributed by the UK Biobank. Traditional GWAS failed to identify any genome-wide significant genetic variants from this dataset. To enhance the power of GWAS and account for possible multi-loci interactions, we adopt the concept of super-variant for the detection of genetic factors. A discovery-validation procedure is used for verifying the potential associations. RESULTS: We find 8 super-variants that are consistently identified across multiple replications as susceptibility loci for COVID-19 mortality. The identified risk factors on Chromosomes 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 16, and 17 contain genetic variants and genes related to cilia dysfunctions (DNAH7 and CLUAP1), cardiovascular diseases (DES and SPEG), thromboembolic disease (STXBP5), mitochondrial dysfunctions (TOMM7), and innate immune system (WSB1). It is noteworthy that DNAH7 has been reported recently as the most downregulated gene after infecting human bronchial epithelial cells with SARS-CoV2. CONCLUSIONS: Eight genetic variants are identified to significantly increase risk of COVID-19 mortality among the patients with white British ancestry. These findings may provide timely evidence and clues for better understanding the molecular pathogenesis of COVID-19 and genetic basis of heterogeneous susceptibility, with potential impact on new therapeutic options.","Hu, Jianchang; Li, Cai; Wang, Shiying; Li, Ting; Zhang, Heping",medRxiv,225,20

The capsid proteins expressed in High Five™ insect cells were processed by viral 3C protease, as shown by Western blotting, and were antigenic, as revealed by their reactivity in an indirect sandwich-ELISA, and by immunofluorescent assay. The empty capsid-like particles were similar to authentic 75S empty capsids from FMDV in terms of their shape, size and sedimentation velocity, as demonstrated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Both empty capsid-like particles and some small-sized particles (about 10 nm in diameter) were also observed using immunoelectron microscopy. Furthermore, the empty capsid-like particles or intermediates induced high levels of FMDV-specific antibodies in guinea pigs following immunization, and neutralizing antibodies were induced in the second week after vaccination.

We did not find any of these two SNPs by retrospectively tracing the two SNPs in bat and pangolin related SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV-2 from the first epicenter Wuhan or other regions of China mainland. This suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 population of Chinese mainland were different from the prevalent strains of North America. Time-dependently, we found that these two SNPs first occurred in Europe SARS-CoV-2 (26-Feb-2020) which was 3 days early than the occurring date of North America isolates and 17 days early for Asia isolates (Taiwan China dominated).

Remarkably, the severity of COVID-19 appears to rise with increasing body mass index (BMI). The association between COVID-19 outcomes and overweight/obesity has biological and physiological plausibility. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain this strong association include the chronic pro-inflammatory state, the excessive oxidative stress response, and the impaired immunity that is commonly reported in these individuals. The role of cytokines, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and altered natural killer cell polarization in the dangerous liaison between COVID-19 and obesity are discussed here. These pathways can favor and accelerate the deleterious downstream cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, obesity is well known to be associated with reduced lung function and poor response to mechanical ventilation, thus placing these individuals at high risk of severe illness and mortality from COVID-19. Furthermore, obesity may lead to other complications, such as renal failure, cardiovascular dysfunction, hypertension, and vascular damage, which in turn can further accelerate negative clinical outcomes from COVID-19. Obese individuals should be shielded against any potential viral exposure to SARS-CoV-2 with consequential considerations for compulsory protection devices and social distancing.

Targeted microbial binding to host glycans has also been studied for decades. But such biological roles can only explain some of the remarkable complexity and organismal diversity of glycans in nature. Reviewing the subject about two decades ago, one could find very few clear-cut instances of glycan-recognition-specific biological roles of glycans that were of intrinsic value to the organism expressing them. In striking contrast there is now a profusion of examples, such that this updated review cannot be comprehensive. Instead, a historical overview is presented, broad principles outlined and a few examples cited, representing diverse types of roles, mediated by various glycan classes, in different evolutionary lineages. What remains unchanged is the fact that while all theories regarding biological roles of glycans are supported by compelling evidence, exceptions to each can be found. In retrospect, this is not surprising. Complex and diverse glycans appear to be ubiquitous to all cells in nature, and essential to all life forms. Thus, >3 billion years of evolution consistently generated organisms that use these molecules for many key biological roles, even while sometimes coopting them for minor functions.

This prospective non-randomized clinical trial's objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of moderate sedation, compared to the protective stabilization, in the dental care of children with dental behavior management problems. METHODS: Participants will be 152 children under seven years of age with early childhood caries (ECC) who need specialized dental treatment due to a history of challenging behavior during dental care. The interventions to be compared are moderate sedation with oral administration of ketamine and midazolam and protective stabilization. The primary endpoint will be the child's behavior during treatment assessed using the Ohio State University Behavioral Rating Scale (OSUBRS). The secondary outcomes are (A) child's – behavior according to the visual analogue scale, anxiety, pain, and physiological stress; (B) parent's – satisfaction and anxiety; (C) family and child – impact on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL); (D) dentist's – satisfaction and stress; (E) procedure – adverse events of the intervention and dental treatment longevity. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from the perspective of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). DISCUSSION: Considering the primary outcome, this study hypothesis is that sedated children have better behavior during dental treatment than children whose behavior was managed by protective stabilization without sedation. Additionally, at the end of 12 months, we expect to identify participants' reported outcomes and objective measures related to dental behavior in early childhood.

Optimal management of childhood pneumonia is challenging in settings where clinicians have limited information regarding the local pathogen and drug resistance profiles. This frequently results in unnecessary and poorly targeted antibiotic use. Restricting antibiotic use is a global priority, particularly in Asia and the Western Pacific Region where excessive use is driving high rates of antimicrobial resistance. The authors conducted a comprehensive literature review to explore the antibiotic resistance profile of bacteria associated with pneumonia in the Western Pacific Region, with a focus on Vietnam. Current management practices were also considered, along with the diagnostic dilemmas faced by doctors and other factors that increase unnecessary antibiotic use. This review offers some suggestions on how these issues may be addressed.","Phuong, Nguyen T.

Lockdowns for pandemic control have health, social and economic consequences. We consider access to healthcare before and during COVID-19 with those working and living in slum communities. METHODS: In seven slums in Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan, we explored stakeholder perspectives and experiences of healthcare access for non-COVID-19 conditions in two periods: pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 lockdowns. RESULTS: Between March 2018 and May 2020, we engaged with 860 community leaders, residents, health workers and local authority representatives. Perceived common illnesses in all sites included respiratory, gastric, waterborne and mosquitoborne illnesses and hypertension. Pre-COVID, stakeholders described various preventive, diagnostic and treatment services, including well-used antenatal and immunisation programmes and some screening for hypertension, tuberculosis, HIV and vectorborne disease. In all sites, pharmacists and patent medicine vendors were key providers of treatment and advice for minor illnesses. Mental health services and those addressing gender-based violence were perceived to be limited or unavailable. With COVID-19, a reduction in access to healthcare services was reported in all sites, including preventive services. Cost of healthcare increased while household income reduced. Residents had difficulty reaching healthcare facilities. Fear of being diagnosed with COVID-19 discouraged healthcare seeking. Alleviators included provision of healthcare by phone, pharmacists/drug vendors extending credit and residents receiving philanthropic or government support; these were inconsistent and inadequate. CONCLUSION: Slum residents’ ability to seek healthcare for non-COVID-19 conditions has been reduced during lockdowns. To encourage healthcare seeking, clear communication is needed about what is available and whether infection control is in place. Policymakers need to ensure that costs do not escalate and unfairly disadvantage slum communities. Remote consulting to reduce face-to-face contact and provision of mental health and gender-based violence services should be considered.","Ahmed, Syed A K Shifat; Ajisola, Motunrayo; Azeem, Kehkashan; Bakibinga, Pauline; Chen, Yen-Fu; Choudhury, Nazratun Nayeem; Fayehun, Olufunke; Griffiths, Frances; Harris, Bronwyn; Kibe, Peter; Lilford, Richard J; Omigbodun, Akinyinka; Rizvi, Narjis; Sartori, Jo; Smith, Simon; Watson, Samuel I; Wilson, Ria; Yeboah, Godwin; Aujla, Navneet; Azam, Syed Iqbal; Diggle, Peter J; Gill, Paramjit; Iqbal, Romaina; Kabaria, Caroline; Kisia, Lyagamula; Kyobutungi, Catherine; Madan, Jason J; Mberu, Blessing; Mohamed, Shukri F; Nazish, Ahsana; Odubanjo, Oladoyin; Osuh, Mary E; Owoaje, Eme; Oyebode, Oyinlola; Porto de Albuquerque, Joao; Rahman, Omar; Tabani, Komal; Taiwo, Olalekan John; Tregonning, Grant; Uthman, Olalekan A; Yusuf, Rita",BMJ Glob Health,225,16

Previous studies revealed that microRNA-122 (miR-122) levels were elevated in the aortic adventitia of hypertensive rats with vascular injury. Here, we aim to evaluate the biological effects and underlying mechanisms of miR-122 in rat AFs. Exposure to angiotensin II (ATII) in rat AFs resulted in decreased levels of sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), elabela (ELA), and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Additionally, stimulation with ATII contributed to a decline in autophagic flux and an increase in cellular migration, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, which were exacerbated by the transfection of miR-122-5p mimic but were rescued by miR-122-5p inhibitor, exogenous replenishment of ELA, and recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing SIRT6 (rAAV-SIRT6). Moreover, stimulation with miR-122-5p mimic led to a marked reduction in the levels of SIRT6 and ELA in rat AFs, which were elevated by stimulation with rAAV-SIRT6. Furthermore, miR-122-5p inhibitor-mediated pro-autophagic, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects in rat AFs were partially suppressed by 3-methyladenine, SIRT6 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and ELA siRNA, which were linked with the downregulation in the protein levels of LC3-II, beclin-1, and ACE2 and the upregulation of p62 expression and bax/bcl-2 ratio. Our findings indicated that miR-122-5p inhibition prevented ATII-mediated loss of autophagy, and the promotion of apoptosis and oxidative stress via activating the SIRT6-ELA-ACE2 signaling. MiR-122-5p may be a novel predictive biomarker of adventitial injury, and targeting the SIRT6-ELA-ACE2 signaling may have the potential therapeutic importance of controlling vascular remodeling and disorders.","Song, Juan-Juan; Yang, Mei; Liu, Ying; Song, Jia-Wei; Wang, Juan; Chi, Hong-Jie; Liu, Xiao-Yan; Zuo, Kun; Yang, Xin-Chun; Zhong, Jiu-Chang",Eur J Pharmacol,225,16

Methods Distinct individuals testing positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 between March 6, 2020, and August 31, 2020, in Kentucky, USA, were identified using the Kentucky National Electronic Disease Surveillance System. Individuals were followed for occurrence of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 from 91 days after their initial test result through December 31, 2020. Protection from reinfection provided by a prior infection was calculated and additional analyses evaluated impact of age, sex, symptom status, long-term care facility connection, testing occurrence and frequency, and time from initial infection. Results Protective effect from prior infection was 80.3% (95% CI, 78.2% – 82.2%) for those aged 20-59 years and 67.4% (95% CI, 62.8% – 71.4%) for those 60 years and older. At 30-day time periods through 270 days (with limited exceptions), protection was estimated to be greater than 75% for those aged 20-59 years and greater than 65% for those 60 years and older. Factors associated with repeat positive testing included a connection to a long-term care facility, duration of potential exposure, and absence of symptoms during initial infection. Conclusions Natural infection provides substantial and persistent immunologic protection for a period of several months for most individuals, although subpopulations may be at greater risk for repeat positive testing and potential poor outcomes associated with reinfection. These subgroups include individuals 60 years and older, residents and staff of long-term care facilities, and those who have mild or asymptomatic illness with initial infection. Continued emphasis on vaccination and infection prevention and control strategies remains critically important in reducing the risk for reinfection and associated severe outcomes for these groups.","Spicer, Kevin B.; Glick, Connor; Cavanaugh, Alyson M.; Thoroughman, Douglas",Int J Infect Dis,225,14

This study aims to assess the asynchrony between individual behavior and government stay-at-home orders, quantify the true impact of social distancing using mobility data, and explore the sociodemographic variables linked to variation in social distancing practices. Methods This study was a retrospective investigation that leveraged mobility data to quantify the time to behavioral change in relation to the initial presence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implementation of government stay-at-home orders. The impact of social distancing that accounts for both individual behavior and testing data was calculated using generalized mixed models. The role of sociodemographics in accounting for variation in social distancing behavior was modeled using 10-fold cross-validated elastic net (linear machine learning model). Analysis was conducted in April‒July 2020. Results Across all 1,124 counties included in this analysis, individuals began to socially distance a median of 5 days (IQR=3–8) after 10 cumulative cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in their state, with state governments taking a median of 15 days (IQR=12–19) to enact stay-at-home orders. Overall, people began social distancing a median of 12 days (IQR=8–17) before their state enacted stay-at-home orders. Of the 16 studies included in the review, 13 exclusively used government dates as a proxy for social distancing behavior and none accounted for both testing and mobility. Using government stay-at-home dates as a proxy for social distancing (10.2% decrease in the number of daily cases) accounted for only 55% of the true impact of the intervention when compared with estimates using mobility (18.6% reduction). Using 10-fold cross-validation, 23 of 43 sociodemographic variables were significantly and independently predictive of variation in individual social distancing, with delays corresponding to an increase in a county's proportion of people without a high school diploma and proportion of racial and ethnic minorities. Conclusions This retrospective analysis of mobility patterns found that social distancing behavior occurred well before the onset of government stay-at-home dates. This asynchrony leads to underestimation of the impact of social distancing. Sociodemographic characteristics associated with delays in social distancing can help explain the disproportionate case burden and mortality among vulnerable communities.","Abdalla, Moustafa; Abar, Arjan; Beiter, Evan R.; Saad, Mohamed",Am J Prev Med,225,20

However, individuals preferences regarding EoL care may differ internationally. Current literature lacks insight in how preferences in EoL care differ between countries and continents. This study's aim is to compare Dutch and Japanese general publics attitudes and preferences toward EoL care, and EoL decisions. Methods: a cross-sectional survey design was chosen. The survey was held among samples of the Dutch and Japanese general public, using a Nationwide social research panel of 220.000 registrants in the Netherlands and 1.200.000 in Japan. A quota sampling was done (age, gender, and living area). N = 1.040 in each country. More Japanese than Dutch citizens tend to avoid thinking in advance about future situations of dependence (26.0% vs 9.4%; P = .000); say they would feel themselves a burden for relatives if they would become dependent in their last phase of life (79.3% vs 47.8%; P = .000); and choose the hospital as their preferred place of death (19.4% vs 3.6% P = .000). More Dutch than Japanese people say they would be happy with a proactive approach of their doctor regarding EoL issues (78.0% vs 65.1% JPN; P = .000). Preferences in EoL care substantially differ between the Netherlands and Japan. These differences should be taken into account a) when interpreting geographical variation in EoL care, and b) if strategies such as SDM or ACP – are considered. Such strategies will fail if an international “one size fits all” approach would be followed.","Groenewoud, A. Stef; Sasaki, Noriko; Westert, Gert P.; Imanaka, Yuichi",Medicine (Baltimore),225,1

Rapid immunoassays are fast but insensitive, whereas real-time RT-PCR is sensitive but susceptible to genetic mutations and often requires multiple serial assays. The FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay provides type and subtype/lineage identification of influenza A and B, including non-seasonal A viruses, in a single microarray-based assay with same day turnaround time. Objective To evaluate key analytical performance characteristics of the FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay. Study design Analytical sensitivity, cross-reactivity, and multi-site reproducibility were evaluated. Results The limit of detection (LOD) for the FluChip-8G influenza A+B Assay ranged from 5.8 × 102–1.5 × 105 genome copies/mL, with most samples ∼2 × 103 genome copies/mL (∼160 genome copies/reaction). Fifty two (52) additional strains were correctly identified near the LOD, demonstrating robust reactivity. Two variant viruses (H1N1v and H3N2v) resulted in dual identification as both “non-seasonal influenza A” and A/H1N1pdm09. No reproducible cross-reactivity was observed for the 34 organisms tested, however, challenges with internal control inhibition due to crude growth matrix were observed. Lastly, samples tested near the LOD showed high reproducibility (97.0% (95% CI 94.7–98.7)) regardless of operator, site, reagent lot, or testing day. Conclusion The FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay is an effective new method for detecting and identifying both seasonal and non-seasonal influenza viruses, as revealed by good sensitivity and robust reactivity to 52 unique strains of influenza virus. In addition, the lack of cross-reactivity to non-influenza pathogens and high lab-to-lab reproducibility highlight the analytical performance of the assay as an alternative to real-time RT-PCR and sequencing-based assays. Clinical validation of the technology in a multi-site clinical study is the subject of a separate investigation.","Taylor, Amber W.; Dawson, Erica D.; Blair, Rebecca H.; Johnson, James E.; Slinskey, Amelia H.; Smolak, Andrew W.; Toth, Evan; Liikanen, Kyle; Stoughton, Robert S.; Smith, Catherine; Talbot, Sarah; Rowlen, Kathy L.",Journal of Virological Methods,225,16

Carnivore protoparvoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses, followed by CanineCV and CAdV. All the wolves tested positive for at least one of the DNA viruses screened, and 47.8% of the subjects were coinfected with two or three viruses. From viral sequences analysis, close correlations emerged between the viruses identified in the wolves and those circulating in domestic dogs, suggesting that the same viruses infect wolves and domestic dogs. Further studies are needed to investigate if pathogens are transmitted between the two species. ABSTRACT: In this study, internal organs (tongue, intestine, and spleen) of 23 free-ranging Italian wolves (Canis lupus italicus) found dead between 2017 and 2019 were tested for Carnivore protoparvovirus 1, Canine adenovirus (CAdV), and Canine circovirus (CanineCV) using real-time PCR assays. Genetic characterisation of the identified viruses was carried out by amplification, sequencing, and analysis of the complete viral genome or informative viral genes. All the wolves tested positive for at least one of the DNA viruses screened, and 11/23 were coinfected. Carnivore protoparvoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses (21/23), followed by CanineCV (11/23) and CAdV (4/23). From the analysis of the partial VP2 gene of 13 carnivore protoparvoviruses, 12 were canine parvovirus type 2b, closely related to the strains detected in dogs and wild carnivores from Italy, and one was a feline panleukopenia-like virus. Of the four CAdV identified, two were CAdV-1 and two were CAdV-2. The complete genome of seven CanineCVs was sequenced and related to the CanineCV identified in dogs, wolves, and foxes worldwide. Close correlations emerged between the viruses identified in wolves and those circulating in domestic dogs. Further studies are needed to investigate if these pathogens may be potentially cross-transmitted between the two species.","Balboni, Andrea; Urbani, Lorenza; Delogu, Mauro; Musto, Carmela; Fontana, Maria Cristina; Merialdi, Giuseppe; Lucifora, Giuseppe; Terrusi, Alessia; Dondi, Francesco; Battilani, Mara",Animals (Basel),225,20

Previous studies have documented the predictors of doctors’ burnout; however, little attention has been paid to village doctors. This study aims to investigate the prevalence and influential factors of burnout among village doctors. (2) Methods: Data was collected by a self-administered questionnaire from 1248 village doctors who had worked at rural clinics for more than a year. Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) with three dimensions—emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and reduced personal accomplishment (PA). A logistic regression model was applied to estimate the influential factors of burnout. (3) Results: The prevalence of overall burnout was 23.6%. Being male (OR = 0.58, 95%CI: 0.41–0.82), poor health status (OR = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.67–0.94), low income (OR = 0.62, 95%CI: 0.40–0.95), and a poor doctor–patient relationship (OR = 0.57, 95%CI: 0.48–0.67) were significantly related to burnout. Conclusion: Burnout is prevalent among Chinese village doctors.

Asymptomatic carriage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a potentially significant source of transmission, yet remains relatively poorly understood. Disruption of dental services continues with significantly reduced capacity. Ongoing precautions include preappointment and/or at appointment COVID-19 symptom screening and use of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE). This study aimed to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in dental patients to inform community surveillance and improve understanding of risks in the dental setting. Thirty-one dental care centers across Scotland invited asymptomatic-screened patients aged over 5 y to participate. Following verbal consent and completion of sociodemographic and symptom history questionnaire, trained dental teams took a combined oropharyngeal and nasal swab sample using standardized Viral Transport Medium–containing test kits. Samples were processed by the Lighthouse Lab and patients informed of their results by SMS/email with appropriate self-isolation guidance in the event of a positive test. All positive cases were successfully followed up by the national contact tracing program. Over a 13-wk period (from August 3, 2020, to October 31, 2020), 4,032 patients, largely representative of the population, were tested. Of these, 22 (0.5%; 95% CI, 0.5%–0.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positivity rate increased over the period, commensurate with uptick in community prevalence identified across all national testing monitoring data streams. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a COVID-19 testing survey in asymptomatic-screened patients presenting in a dental setting. The positivity rate in this patient group reflects the underlying prevalence in community at the time. These data are a salient reminder, particularly when community infection levels are rising, of the importance of appropriate ongoing infection prevention control and PPE vigilance, which is relevant as health care team fatigue increases as the pandemic continues. Dental settings are a valuable location for public health surveillance.","Conway, D.I.; Culshaw, S.; Edwards, M.; Clark, C.; Watling, C.; Robertson, C.; Braid, R.; O’Keefe, E.; McGoldrick, N.; Burns, J.; Provan, S.; VanSteenhouse, H.; Hay, J.; Gunson, R.",J Dent Res,225,6

The KmR gene was then excised by PstI, which left a 48-bp linker representing the heterologous sequence. The same procedure was followed to introduce a synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) corresponding to epitope C from the spike protein S from the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). Nine insertion/deletion mutants (indels) that contained long foreign peptides variously located around the ClpG signal peptide (SP) processing site were characterized. A striking feature of this study is the variety of amino acid (aa) insertions in the ClpG prepilin that have little or no effect on CS31A fimbria biogenesis. These ‘permissive’ sites tolerate inserts of 18 or 19 aa and accept sequences of different natures in view of their aa composition, charge and hydrophobicity. The results obtained here are also interesting in light of the high level of aa sequence conservation seen in the SP and N-terminal domains of the ClpG-related subunits. The structure-function relationship of the ClpG SP is discussed. The TGEV-C epitope fused to the N-terminal end of the mature ClpG protein was cell-surface exposed, as observed on immuno-electron microscopy. Therefore, the CS31A fimbria seems to be a potent tool for the presentation of foreign antigenic determinants or the production of heterologous polypeptides in E. coli.","Der Vartanian, Maurice; Méchin, Marie-Claire; Jaffeux, Bernard; Bertin, Yolande; Félix, Isabelle; Gaillard-Martinie, Brigitte",Gene,225,16

Cancer patients seem to be more susceptible to infection and disease deterioration, but the factors affecting the deterioration remain unclear. We aimed to develop an individualized model for prediction of coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) deterioration in cancer patients. The clinical data of 276 cancer patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 in 33 designated hospitals of Hubei, China from December 21, 2019 to March 18, 2020, were collected and randomly divided into a training and a validation cohort by a ratio of 2:1. Cox stepwise regression analysis was carried out to select prognostic factors. The prediction model was developed in the training cohort. The predictive accuracy of the model was quantified by C‐index and time‐dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (t‐AUC). Internal validation was assessed by the validation cohort. Risk stratification based on the model was carried out. Decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the model. We found age, cancer type, computed tomography baseline image features (ground glass opacity and consolidation), laboratory findings (lymphocyte count, serum levels of C‐reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, direct bilirubin, urea, and d‐dimer) were significantly associated with symptomatic deterioration. The C‐index of the model was 0.755 in the training cohort and 0.779 in the validation cohort. The t‐AUC values were above 0.7 within 8 weeks both in the training and validation cohorts.

These factors mask the useful pattern (signal) of disease spread. Thus, an ingenious method to group data into cycles of five and seven days, for studying pattern of disease spread is undertaken. Occurrence of recurrent peaks as indicated by Adjusted Rate of infection per day indicated the spread of disease has been non-uniform. Currently, India is yet to reach the critical point (peak of epidemic) with adjusted daily cases more than 1000.

Models agree that flattening the curve without controlling the epidemic completely is insufficient and will lead to an overwhelmed health service. A recent model, calibrated for the UK and US, demonstrated this starkly. Methods: We used a simple compartmental deterministic model of COVID-19 transmission in Australia, to illustrate the dynamics resulting from shifting or flattening the curve versus completely squashing it. Results: We find that when the reproduction number is close to one, a small decrease in transmission leads to a large reduction in burden (i.e., cases, deaths and hospitalisations) but achieving this early in the epidemic through social distancing interventions also implies that the community will not reach herd immunity. Conclusions: Australia needs not just to shift and flatten the curve but to squash it by getting the reproduction number below one. This will require Australia to achieve for transmission rates at least two thirds lower than those seen in the most severely affected countries.","McBryde, Emma S; Meehan, Michael T; Trauer, James M",,225,9

But no studies to date have systematically described liver test abnormalities in patients with COVID-19. We evaluated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with abnormal liver test results. METHODS: Clinical records and laboratory results were obtained from 417 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China from January 11 to February 21, 2020 and followed up to March 7, 2020. Information on clinical features of patients with abnormal liver tests were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Of 417 patients with COVID-19, 318 (76.3%) had abnormal liver test results and 90 (21.5%) had liver injury during hospitalization. The presence of abnormal liver tests became more pronounced during hospitalization within 2 weeks, with 49 (23.4%), 31 (14.8%), 24 (11.5%) and 51 (24.4%) patients having alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels elevated to more than 3× the upper limit of normal, respectively. Patients with abnormal liver tests of hepatocellular type or mixed type at admission had higher odds of progressing to severe disease (odds ratios [ORs] 2.73; 95% CI 1.19–6.3, and 4.44, 95% CI 1.93–10.23, respectively). The use of lopinavir/ritonavir was also found to lead to increased odds of liver injury (OR from 4.44 to 5.03, both p <0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with abnormal liver tests were at higher risk of progressing to severe disease. The detrimental effects on liver injury mainly related to certain medications used during hospitalization, which should be monitored and evaluated frequently. LAY SUMMARY: Data on liver tests in patients with COVID-19 are scarce. We observed a high prevalence of liver test abnormalities and liver injury in 417 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our referral center, and the prevalence increased substantially during hospitalization. The presence of abnormal liver tests and liver injury were associated with the progression to severe pneumonia. The detrimental effects on liver injury were related to certain medications used during hospitalization, which warrants frequent monitoring and evaluation for these patients.","Cai, Qingxian; Huang, Deliang; Yu, Hong; Zhu, Zhibin; Xia, Zhang; Su, Yinan; Li, Zhiwei; Zhou, Guangde; Gou, Jizhou; Qu, Jiuxin; Sun, Yan; Liu, Yingxia; He, Qing; Chen, Jun; Liu, Lei; Xu, Lin",J Hepatol,225,26

We applied this approach to the WA-1 reference clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 passaged in vitro and to upper respiratory samples from 7 study participants with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cell culture were diverse, including 18 haplotypes with non-synonymous mutations clustered in the spike NH(2)-terminal domain (NTD) and furin cleavage site regions. By contrast, cross-sectional analysis of samples from participants with COVID-19 showed fewer virus variants, without structural clustering of mutations. However, longitudinal analysis in one individual revealed 4 virus haplotypes bearing 3 independent mutations in a spike NTD epitope targeted by autologous antibodies. These mutations arose coincident with a 6.2-fold rise in serum binding to spike and a transient increase in virus burden.

Despite the announcement of post-pandemic period on 10 August 2010 by theWHO, H1N1 (2009) virus would continue to circulate as a seasonal virus for some years and national health authorities should remain vigilant due to unpredictable behaviour of the virus. Majority of the world population is living in countries with inadequate resources to purchase vaccines and stockpile antiviral drugs. Basic hygienic measures such as wearing face masks and the hygienic practice of hand washing could reduce the spread of the respiratory viruses. However, the imminent issue is translating these measures into day-to-day practice. The experience from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong has shown that general practitioners (GPs) were willing to discharge their duties despite risks of getting infected themselves. SARS event has highlighted the inadequate interface between primary and secondary care and valuable health care resources were thus inappropriately matched to community needs. There are various ways for GPs to contribute in combating the influenza pandemic. They are prompt in detecting and monitoring epidemics and mini-epidemics of viral illnesses in the community. They can empower and raise the health literacy of the community such as advocating personal hygiene and other precautious measures. GPs could also assist in the development of protocols for primary care management of patients with flu-like illnesses and conduct clinical audits on the standards of preventive and treatment measures. GPs with adequate liaison with public health agencies would facilitate early diagnosis of patients with influenza. In this article, we summarise the primary care actions for phases 4-6 of the pandemic. We shall discuss the novel roles of GPs as alternative source of health care for patients who would otherwise be cared for in the secondary care level.

From an immunologic viewpoint, the final severe lung damage observed in COVID-19 should be caused by cytokine storm, driven mainly by interleukin-6 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, which immunopathogenic status precedes this “cytokine storm” and why the male older population is more severely affected, are currently unanswered questions. The aging of the immune system, i.e., immunosenescence, closely associated with a low-grade inflammatory status called “inflammageing,” should play a key role. The remodeling of both innate and adaptive immune response observed with aging can partly explain the age gradient in severity and mortality of COVID-19.

Indeed, due to immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a worth-considering option against COVID-19 adverse outcomes.","Ligotti, Mattia Emanuela; Pojero, Fanny; Accardi, Giulia; Aiello, Anna; Caruso, Calogero; Duro, Giovanni; Candore, Giuseppina",Front Cell Dev Biol,225,20

To analyze the linkage between LDV envelope proteins, M/VP-2 and VP-3, which may play an important role in viral infectivity, we generated specific antibody against M/VP-2 that has not been reported in previous studies. A synthetic polypeptide corresponding to the C-terminal region of LDV strain C (LDV-C) ORF6, which encodes M/VP-2, was chemically synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). The peptide was immunogenic in rabbits and induced antibody specific for viral protein. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis of virion M/VP-2 in infected macrophages showed that the antibody was able to react specifically with authentic virion protein. The immunoreactive antibody against LDV M/VP-2 described in this study will be useful for further studies of the specific roles of the envelope proteins in arterivirus assembly and infectivity.","Takahashi-Omoe, H; Omoe, K; Sakaguchi, M; Kameoka, Y; Matsushita, S; Inada, T","Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",225,24

However, sharing private health data with strangers from around the world is not compatible with data privacy standards, requiring a stringent filtration process to recruit reliable and trustworthy workers who can go through the proper training and security steps. The key challenge, then, is to identify capable, trustworthy, and reliable workers through high-fidelity evaluation tasks without exposing any sensitive patient data during the evaluation process. We contribute a set of experimentally validated metrics for assessing the trustworthiness and reliability of crowd workers tasked with providing behavioral feature tags to unstructured videos of children with autism and matched neurotypical controls. The workers are blinded to diagnosis and blinded to the goal of using the features to diagnose autism. These behavioral labels are fed as input to a previously validated binary logistic regression classifier for detecting autism cases using categorical feature vectors. While the metrics do not incorporate any ground truth labels of child diagnosis, linear regression using the 3 correlative metrics as input can predict the mean probability of the correct class of each worker with a mean average error of 7.51% for performance on the same set of videos and 10.93% for performance on a distinct balanced video set with different children. These results indicate that crowd workers can be recruited for performance based largely on behavioral metrics on a crowdsourced task, enabling an affordable way to filter crowd workforces into a trustworthy and reliable diagnostic workforce.","Washington, Peter; Leblanc, Emilie; Dunlap, Kaitlyn; Penev, Yordan; Varma, Maya; Jung, Jae-Yoon; Chrisman, Brianna; Sun, Min Woo; Stockham, Nathaniel; Paskov, Kelley Marie; Kalantarian, Haik; Voss, Catalin; Haber, Nick; Wall, Dennis P.",Pac Symp Biocomput,225,5

METHODS: We retrospectively collected 147 clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients at Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital of Hubei, China. We analyzed the coagulation function in COVID-19 patients through the data including thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), α2-plasmininhibitor-plasmin Complex (PIC), thrombomodulin (TM), t-PA/PAI-1 Complex (t-PAIC), prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), thrombin time (TT), D-Dimer (DD), and platelet (PLT). RESULT: The levels of TAT, PIC, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, FIB, and DD in COVID-19 patients were higher than health controls (p<0.05), and also higher in the patients with thrombotic disease than without thrombotic disease (p<0.05). What’s more, the patients with thrombotic disease had a higher case-fatality (p<0.05). TAT, PIC, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, APTT, FIB, DD, and PLT were also found correlated with disease severity. Meanwhile, we found that there were significant difference in TAT, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, APTT, DD, and PLT in the death and survival group. Further using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis also found that t-PAIC and DD were independent risk factors for death in patients and are excellent predicting the mortality risk of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Most COVID-19 patients with inordinate coagulation systems, dynamic monitoring of coagulation parameters might be a key in the control of COVID-19 death.","Jin, Xin; Duan, Yongwei; Bao, Tengfei; Gu, Junjuan; Chen, Yawen; Li, Yuanyuan; Mao, Shi; Chen, Yongfeng; Xie, Wen",PLoS One,225,20

METHODS: Adult (≥ 18 years old) patients from the 2012 to 2018 ACS-NSQIP colectomy-targeted database who underwent elective colon cancer surgery were identified. A prediction model for 30-day postoperative Intensive Care Resource Utilization was developed and transformed into a clinical risk score based on the regression coefficients. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. The model was validated in a separate test set of similar patients. RESULTS: In total, 54,893 patients underwent an elective colon cancer resection, of which 1224 (2.2%) required postoperative Intensive Care Resource Utilization. The final prediction model retained six variables: age (≥ 70; OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.68–2.14), sex (male; OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.54–1.95), American Society of Anesthesiologists score (III/IV; OR 2.52, 95% CI 2.15–2.95), cardiorespiratory disease (yes; OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.94–2.53), functional status (dependent; OR 2.81, 95% CI 2.22–3.56), and operative approach (open surgery; OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.51–1.93). The model demonstrated good discrimination (AUC = 0.73). A clinical risk score was developed, and the risk of requiring postoperative Intensive Care Resource Utilization ranged from 0.03 (0 points) to 19.0% (8 points). The model performed well on test set validation (AUC = 0.73). CONCLUSION: A prediction model and clinical risk score for postoperative Intensive Care Resource Utilization after colon cancer surgery was developed and validated.","Garfinkle, Richard; Abou-Khalil, Maria; Salama, Ebram; Marinescu, Daniel; Pang, Allison; Morin, Nancy; Demyttenaere, Sebastian; Liberman, A.

Previously we identified the extra domain to be involved in enzyme dimerization which has been considered essential for the catalytic activity. In an initial attempt to map out the extra‐domain residues critical for dimerization, we have systematically generated 15 point mutations, five deletions and one triple mutation and subsequently characterized them by enzymatic assay, dynamic light scattering, CD and NMR spectroscopy. The results led to identification of four regions critical for enzyme dimerization. Interestingly, Asn214Ala mutant with a significant tendency to form a monomer still retained ≈ 30% activity, indicating that the relationship between the activity and dimerization might be very complex. Very surprisingly, two regions (one over Ser284–Thr285–Ile286 and another around Phe291) were discovered on which Ala‐mutations significantly increased the enzymatic activities. Based on this, a super‐active triple‐mutant STI/A with a 3.7‐fold activity enhancement was thus engineered by mutating residues Ser284, Thr285 and Ile286 to Ala. The dynamic light scattering, CD and NMR characterizations indicate that the wild‐type (WT) and STI/A mutant share similar structural and dimerization properties, thus implying that in addition to dimerization, the extra domain might have other mechanisms to regulate the catalytic machinery. We rationalized these results based on the enzyme structure and consequently observed an interesting picture: the majority of the dimerization‐critical residues plus Ser284–Thr285–Ile286 and Phe291 are clustered together to form a nano‐scale channel passing through the central region of the enzyme. We therefore speculate that this channel might play a role in relaying regulatory effects from the extra domain to the catalytic machinery.","Shi, Jiahai; Song, Jianxing",FEBS J,225,26

Twelve clinically suspected and histopathologically confirmed cases of IP seen from November 2019 through February 2020 were retrospectively recruited. Clinical, dermoscopic, and histopathological characteristics of these were reviewed and compared with CLL reported in the literature. Mean age of patients was 26.58 ± 15.18 years with an equal male to female ratio. Characteristic histopathology findings were spongiosis (100%), dermal edema (100%), perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (100%) with peri‐eccrine accentuation (66.7%), keratinocyte necrosis (50%), focal basal vacuolar damage (58.3%), and lymphocytic vasculitis (58.3%).

There appears no exclusive histopathological as well as dermoscopy features of CLL and IP, yet certain clues can be appreciated. Keratinocyte necrosis and severe dermal edema favors IP, whereas fibrin thrombi with involvement of both superficial and deep dermal vessels favor CLL. Dermoscopically presence of irregular, linear or branching vessels, red/purple dots and clods and gray brown reticule supports CLL while white dots/clods and lines supports IP.","Jindal, Rashmi; Chauhan, Payal; Goyal, Dikshita; Shirazi, Nadia",Dermatol Ther,225,17

Notably, it has a well-established role in the DNA damage response. While it was historically known as a post-translational modification of proteins, recent studies have shown that nucleic acids can also serve as substrates of reversible ADP-ribosylation. More precisely, ADP-ribosylation of DNA bases, phosphorylated DNA ends and phosphorylated RNA ends have been reported. We will discuss these three types of modification in details. In a variety of bacterial species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, ADP-ribosylation of thymidine has emerged as the mode of action of a toxin-antitoxin system named DarTG, with the resultant products perceived as DNA damage by the cell. On the other hand, mammalian DNA damage sensors PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3 were shown to ADP-ribosylate phosphorylated ends of double-stranded DNA in vitro. Additionally, TRPT1 and several PARP enzymes, including PARP10, can add ADP-ribose to the 5’-phosphorylated end of single-stranded RNA in vitro, representing a novel RNA capping mechanism. Together, these discoveries have led to the emergence of a new and exciting research area, namely DNA and RNA ADP-ribosylation, that is likely to have far-reaching implications for the fields of DNA repair, replication and epigenetics.","Groslambert, Joséphine; Prokhorova, Evgeniia; Ahel, Ivan",DNA Repair (Amst),225,16

In this study, a quartz crystal microbalance-based immunosensor (QCM) has been developed and its potential evaluated for the rapid and sensitive detection of both influenza A and B viruses in laboratory-cultured preparations and clinical samples. The effective limit for detection by QCM for stock preparations of both A/PR/8/34 and B/Lee/40 viruses was 1 × 10(4) pfu/mL, associated with observed frequency shifts of 30 (±5) and 37 (±6.5) Hz, respectively.

Based on virus genome sequencing studies, the bat is suspected as the natural host of virus, and infection might be transmitted from bats via unknown intermediate hosts like reptiles and snakes etc., to infect humans. COVID-19 is transmitted from person to person contact, primarily via droplet infection within the incubation period or after clinical manifestations of fever, cough, sneezing, sputum, dyspnea, and pneumonia and through contaminated fomites. COVID-19 enters the respiratory tract through the ACE2 receptor on alveoli through binding of s-protein of the virus and causes injuries though the cytopathic effect, as well as cytokines and other mediators, released after developing sepsis.

Sarcopenia is an age-related disorder that increases hospitalization, dependencies, and mortality in older adults. It starts to develop in midlife or even earlier as a result of unbalanced diet/poor nutrition and low levels of physical activity, in addition to chronic disorders such as obesity and diabetes mellitus. Given that social isolation is adopted as the most protective measure against COVID-19, the level of physical activity and the intake of adequate diet have considerably declined, especially among older adults—denoting an increased possibility for developing sarcopenia. Research also shows a higher vulnerability of sarcopenic people to COVID-19 as well as the development of wasting disorders such as sarcopenia and cachexia in a considerable proportion of symptomatic and recovering COVID-19 patients. Muscular wasting in COVID-19 is associated with poor prognosis. Accordingly, early detection and proper management of sarcopenia and wasting conditions in older adults and COVID-19 patients may minimize morbidity and mortality during the current COVID-19 crisis. This review explored different aspects of screening for sarcopenia, stressing their relevance to the detection of altered muscular structure and performance in patients with COVID-19. Current guidelines recommend prior evaluation of muscle strength by simple measures such as grip strength to identify individuals with proven weakness who then would be screened for muscle mass loss. The latter is best measured by MRI and CT. However, due to the high cost and radiation risk entailed by these techniques, other simpler and cheaper techniques such as DXA and ultrasound are given preference. Muscle loss in COVID-19 patients was measured during the acute phase by CT scanning of the pectoralis muscle simultaneously during a routine check for lung fibrosis, which seems to be an efficient evaluation of sarcopenia among those patients with no additional cost.

Methods We retrospectively investigated the clinical and laboratory characteristics of severe COVID-19 patients. 107 patients were divided into hypocalcemia group and normal serum calcium group. The clinical and laboratory data were compared between two groups. The discriminative power of hypocalcemia regarding poor outcome were evaluated by receiver operating curves (ROC) analyze. Results 67 patients (62.6%) had hypocalcemia. In hypocalcemia group, leukocytes, c-reactive protein(CRP), procalcitonin(PCT), Interleukin 6(IL-6), and D-dimer levels was higher, while lymphocytes and albumin(ALB) levels was lower. No significant difference was identified in gender, age, signs and symptoms, comorbidities and other laboratory indicators. Serum calcium levels were negatively correlated with leukocytes, CRP, PCT, IL-6 and D-dimer, while positively correlated with lymphocytes and ALB. Patients with hypocalcemia more commonly presented poor outcome (47.8% (32/67) vs 25% (10/40), p =0.02). Median serum calcium levels were significantly lower in the patients with poor outcome (2.01(1.97-2.05) vs 2.10(2.03-2.20), p<0.001), and it could predict the prognosis with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.73(95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-0.83, p<0.001). Conclusions Hypocalcemia commonly occurred in severe COVID-19 patients and it was associated with poor outcome.","Liu, Jingmei; Han, Ping; Wu, Jingwen; Gong, Jin; Tian, Dean",J Infect Public Health,225,33
644714,644714,644714,Global health degrees: at what cost?,20.150799,1.7341477,2020-08-05,"Background: Since December 2019 the highly contagious COVID-19 virus has been spreading worldwide with a rapid spike in the number of deaths. The WHO declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic in March 2020. As of June 2020 it has been 7 months since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China. So far, COVID-19 has affected more than 24 million people in 215 countries/territories, has caused more than 0.8 million deaths and spread unpredictably quickly among people worldwide. The infection rate in many nations continues to spike. After restraint of the initial outbreak failed, authorities turned to implementing new policies designed to slow the contagion of the virus and the spread of COVID-19 to a manageable rate. This paper presents a systematic analysis to examine in the 25 most affected countries the association between the dates of first death and the first case of the virus to analyse the virulence and also to examine the association between the first case and the virus spread. Methodology: Data from the WHO website were used. After filtering the data, we calculated the number of days between the first reported case in China and the first reported case in each of the countries, NDFC. Another variable, NDFD, the number of days between the first reported case and first reported case of each country, was also calculated. Then we established the correlation between NDFC and NDFD. Tables are used to show the statistics and charts in order to make the findings clearer. Results: The date of the first death of each country is not dependant on the first case. When NDFC is high, the variable NDFD is homogeneously low. When the variable NDFC is low, the variable NDFD is heterogeneous. The virus could have been mutating and became more virulent during March. The countries with the highest number of deaths are not the most affected countries when analysing the death ratio of cases and population. Conclusions: COVID-19 has spread unpredictably quickly among people worldwide. In this critical situation, this paper presents a systematic analysis about the infected cases of COVID-19, deaths and association between first case and first death in each country. In order to obtain a true picture it is necessary to analyse the raw date in different dimensions, and at the end of the paper we will show a clear picture about which countries have controlled the virus very efficiently and which countries have been most affected by it to date.","Jamsheela, O",Ethics Med Public Health,225,12

In the acute phase, the presence of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus in the aerodigestive tract limited activities in the gastroenterology clinic and procedures to emergencies only. Motility and function testing was interrupted and as we enter the recovery phase, restarting these procedures requires a safety‐focused approach with adequate infection prevention for patients and healthcare professionals. METHODS: We summarized knowledge on the presence of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus in the aerodigestive tract and the risk of spread with motility and functional testing. We surveyed 39 European centers documenting how the pandemic affected activities and which measures they are considering for restarting these measurements. We propose recommendations based on current knowledge as applied in our center. RESULTS: Positioning of catheters for gastrointestinal motility tests carries a concern for aerosol‐borne infection of health care workers. The risk is low with breath tests. The surveyed centers stopped almost all motility and function tests from the second half of March. The speed of restarting and the safety measures taken varied highly. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: Based on these findings, we provided recommendations and practical relevant information for motility and function test procedures in the COVID‐19 pandemic era, to guarantee a high‐quality patient care with adequate infection prevention.","Tack, Jan; Schol, Jolien; Geeraerts, Annelies; Huang, I‐Hsuan; Mori, Hideki; Scarpellini, Emidio; Sinonquel, Pieter; Carbone, Florencia; Colomier, Esther; Geysen, Hannelore; Jandee, Sawangpong; Moonen, An; Pannemans, Jasper; Timmermans, Lien; Van den Houte, Karen; Verbeure, Wout; Wauters, Lucas; Bisschops, Raf; Hoffman, Ilse; Roelandt, Philip; Rommel, Nathalie; Simren, Magnus; Suzuki, Hidekazu; Tornblom, Hans; Verbeke, Kristin; Vanuytsel, Tim",Neurogastroenterol Motil,225,16

An understanding of the nature of these interactions provides insight into metabolic processes and critical regulatory events of the host cell as well as into the mechanisms of pathogenesis by infectious microorganisms. Pathogen exposure induces changes in host proteins at many functional levels including cell signaling pathways, protein degradation, cytokines and growth factor production, phagocytosis, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Since proteins are responsible for the cell biological functions, pathogens have evolved to manipulate the host cell proteome to achieve optimal replication. Intracellular pathogens can also change their proteome to adapt to the host cell and escape from immune surveillance, or can incorporate cellular proteins to invade other cells. Given that the interactions of intracellular infectious agents with host cells are mainly at the protein level, proteomics is the most suitable tool for investigating these interactions. Proteomics is the systematic analysis of proteins, particularly their interactions, modifications, localization and functions, that permits the study of the association between pathogens with their host cells as well as complex interactions such as the host–vector–pathogen interplay. A review on the most relevant proteomic applications used in the study of host–pathogen interactions is presented.","Coiras, Mayte; Camafeita, Emilio; López‐Huertas, María Rosa; Calvo, Enrique; López, Juan Antonio; Alcamí, José",Proteomics,225,24

In Germany, existing governance at the state level seems to hardly foster effective land management at the municipal level to achieve overarching goals at the level of the European Union such as “no net land take”. Germany aims to limit land consumption to less than 30 ha per day by 2030. This goal is hardly translated to the municipal level where actual land-use decisions are taken due to the municipal planning sovereignty. In order to address these deficiencies, this study characterizes land consumption in the Nuremberg Metropolitan Region with self-organizing maps and identifies major factors explaining cluster differences using boosted regression trees. We identified four major clusters: booming, prosperous, moderate, and transition regions. Generally, beneficial demographics (population growth and lower old-age dependency ratio) and financial power of municipalities come at the expense of considerable settlement and traffic infrastructure development (i.e., increased land consumption), creating the impression of a rather unregulated market despite the existing planning framework in Germany. Based on these clusters, we developed an indicator set through a participatory process to improve land-use planning following three dimensions: efficient land use, preservation of cultural landscapes and its services, and fostering the regional added value of agricultural products beyond the current local political focus. Future research should assess whether municipalities with better information will reduce land consumption due to increased awareness.","Meyer, Markus A.; Lehmann, Isabella; Seibert, Otmar; Früh-Müller, Andrea",Environ Manage,225,21

Several recent reviews have brought to light a dramatic escalation in the use of long-term non-invasive ventilation in children over the last 30 years. This is due both to the growing number of children receiving care for complex and severe diseases necessitating respiratory support and to the availability of LT-NIV equipment that can be used at home. While significant gaps in availability persist for smaller children and especially infants, home LT-NIV for children with chronic respiratory insufficiency has improved their quality of life and decreased the overall cost of care. While long-term NIV is usually delivered during sleep, it can also be delivered 24 h a day in selected patients. Close collaboration between the hospital complex-care team, the home LT-NIV program, and family caregivers is of the utmost importance for successful home LT-NIV. Long-term NIV is indicated for respiratory disorders responsible for chronic alveolar hypoventilation, with the aim to increase life expectancy and maximize quality of life. LT-NIV is considered for conditions that affect respiratory-muscle performance (alterations in central respiratory drive or neuromuscular function) and/or impose an excessive respiratory load (airway obstruction, lung disease, or chest-wall anomalies). Relative contraindications for LT-NIV include the inability of the local medical infrastructure to support home LT-NIV and poor motivation or inability of the patient/caregivers to cooperate or understand recommendations. Anatomic abnormalities that interfere with interface fitting, inability to protect the lower airways due to excessive airway secretions and/or severely impaired swallowing, or failure of LT-NIV to support respiration can lead to considering invasive ventilation via tracheostomy. Of note, providing home LT-NIV during the COVID 19 pandemic has become more challenging. This is due both to the disruption of medical systems and the fear of contaminating care providers and family with aerosols generated by a patient positive for SARS-CoV-2 during NIV. Delay in initiating LT-NIV, decreased frequency of home visits by the home ventilation program, and decreased availability of polysomnography and oximetry/transcutaneous PCO(2) monitoring are observed. Teleconsultations and telemonitoring are being developed to mitigate these challenges.","Praud, Jean-Paul",Front Pediatr,225,24

Development of animal models that recapitulate important aspects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical for the evaluation of vaccines and antivirals, and understanding disease pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to use the same entry receptor as SARS-CoV-1, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) [1–3]. Due to amino acid differences between murine and hACE2, inbred mouse strains fail to support high titer viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, a number of transgenic and knock-in mouse models, as well as viral vector-mediated hACE2 delivery systems have been developed. Here we compared the K18-hACE2 transgenic model to adenovirus-mediated delivery of hACE2 to the mouse lung. We show that K18-hACE2 mice replicate virus to high titers in the nasal turbinates, lung and brain, with high lethality, and cytokine/chemokine production. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated delivery results in viral replication to lower titers limited to the nasal turbinates and lung, and no clinical signs of infection. The K18-hACE2 model provides a stringent model for testing vaccines and antivirals, whereas the adenovirus delivery system has the flexibility to be used across multiple genetic backgrounds and modified mouse strains.","Rathnasinghe, Raveen; Strohmeier, Shirin; Amanat, Fatima; Gillespie, Virginia L.; Krammer, Florian; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Coughlan, Lynda; Schotsaert, Michael; Uccellini, Melissa B.",Emerging microbes & infections,225,22

However, relatively little is known about the impact of these common infections on individuals with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A review of the literature identifies three key areas that need further exploration. First, moderate-to-severe and even fatal lower respiratory viral illnesses in HIV-infected individuals have been reported. In general, the clinical presentation of these respiratory viral infections in persons with HIV infection is similar to their presentation in individuals without HIV infection. The major exception is the occurrence of fulminant, and often fatal, disseminated adenovirus infection in adults and children with HIV disease. Despite these reports, no information is available regarding the frequency of moderate-to-severe respiratory viral illnesses in individuals with HIV infection. Epidemiologic studies of respiratory viral illnesses in cohorts of HIV-infected adults and children are needed. Second, prolonged shedding of respiratory viruses for weeks and even months has been documented in HIV-infected adults and children. The frequency of prolonged shedding in this population has not been well defined, but data from a small newborn cohort study suggest that, at least for RSV, prolonged shedding is common. Prolonged respiratory viral shedding has implications for infection control in medical facilities where HIV-infected individuals are treated and in nursing homes, child care centers, and group foster homes that provide care for HIV-infected individuals. Therapies to help eliminate these chronic viral infections should be explored. Finally, indirect evidence suggests that respiratory viral infection may result in changes in HIV replication and, theoretically, HIV disease progression. Increased HIV-1 replication has been demonstrated in vitro in T lymphoma cells exposed to genetic material from adenovirus.

In doing so, we also verified the assumption that when faced with real-life scientific problems, people do not necessarily apply decontextualized knowledge of methodological principles, but reason from the bottom up, i.e. by predominantly relying on heuristics based on what they already know or believe about the topic. One thousand and twelve adults completed three measures of scientific literacy (science knowledge, scientific reasoning, attitudes to science) and several other related constructs (numeracy, need for cognition, PISA tasks). In general, Slovak participants’ performance on scientific reasoning tasks was fairly low and dependent on the context in which the problems were presented—there was a 63% success rate for a version with concrete problems and a 56% success rate for the decontextualized version. The main contribution of this study is a modification and validation of the scientific reasoning scale using a large sample size, which allows for more thorough testing of all components of scientific literacy.

Acute PEDV outbreaks have continually emerged in most swine-producing Asian countries and, recently, in the United States, causing significant economic losses in the pig industry. The spike (S) protein of PEDV is a type 1 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein and consists of the S1 and S2 domains, which are responsible for virus binding and fusion, respectively. Since the S1 domain is involved in a specific high-affinity interaction with the cellular receptor and induction of neutralizing antibody in the natural host, it is a primary target for the development of effective vaccines against PEDV. In this study, a codon-optimized PEDV S1 gene containing amino acid residues 25–738 was synthesized based on a multiple alignment of the S amino acid sequences of PEDV field isolates and used to establish a stable porcine cell line constitutively expressing the PEDV S1 protein. The purified recombinant S1 protein was found to mediate highly potent antibody responses in immunized rabbits. The antibodies strongly recognized the recombinant S1 protein from cell lysates and supernatants of S1-expressing cells, whereas they bound weakly to the authentic S protein of PEDV vaccine strain SM98-1. Furthermore, a serum neutralization test revealed that the rabbit antisera completely inhibit infection of the PEDV vaccine strain at a serum dilution of 1:16. We then tested the ability of vaccination with the recombinant S1 protein to protect piglets against PEDV. Late-term pregnant sows were inoculated intramuscularly with the purified S1 protein, and the outcome was investigated in passively immunized suckling piglets after a virulent PEDV challenge. The results showed that vaccination with S1 protein efficiently protected neonatal piglets against PEDV. Our data suggest that the recombinant S1 protein shows potential as an effective and safe subunit vaccine for PED prevention.","Oh, Jongsuk; Lee, Kyung-Won; Choi, Hwan-Won; Lee, Changhee",Arch Virol,225,1

Cardiac manifestations are common, but little is known about the potentially persistent heart changes after PIMS‐TS. PURPOSE: To analyze the frequency and type of myocardial complications of PIMS‐TS with initial cardiac involvement assessed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including parametric imaging, performed 3 months after hospitalization. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: Nineteen consecutive children (median age 10 years, interquartile range (IQR) 10–15 years, 74% male). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP, cine imaging), modified Look‐Locker (T1 mapping), T2‐prepared bSSFP (T2‐mapping), dark‐blood T2‐weighted turbo spin echo with fat suppression and phase sensitive inversion recovery (late gadolinium enhancement (LGE)) sequences at 1.5 T. ASSESSMENT: Patients were scanned after a median of 99 days (IQR 89–104 days) from the diagnosis. MR data were reviewed by three independent observers, with 13, 2, and 5 years' experience in cardiac MRI. Pre‐ and post‐contrast T1, T2, extra‐cellular volume, and T2 signal intensity (T2 SI) ratio were calculated. Diagnosis of acute myocarditis was based on modified Lake Louise criteria. Cardiac MRI parameters were compared, where possible, to previously published pediatric normal values. STATISTICAL TESTS: Interclass correlation coefficient and Bland–Altman repeatability analysis. A P‐value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Despite cardiac involvement including decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (median LVEF = 47%, IQR 43%–53%) and increased troponin I (median 101 ng/mL, IQR 50–661 ng/mL) during hospitalization, there were no persistent cardiac changes observed in cardiac MR at follow‐up. All patients had normal size and function of the left ventricle and normal precontrast T1 and T2 relaxation times. There were no signs of LGE. Persistent, mild pericardial effusion (8–9 mm) was found in three (16%) patients. DATA CONCLUSION: There were no persistent changes on cardiac MRI in a group of children approximately 3 months post hospitalization due to PIMS‐TS with cardiac involvement. This supports the hypothesis that cardiac involvement during PIMS‐TS is a form of transient inflammatory response rather than direct and potentially persistent injury from the virus.

They are present on virtually all nucleated cells of vertebrates and are also present in invertebrates, indicative of a long evolutionary history. Genetic models in both vertebrates and invertebrates have shown that syndecans link to the actin cytoskeleton and can fine-tune cell adhesion, migration, junction formation, polarity and differentiation. Although often associated as co-receptors with other classes of receptors (e.g. integrins, growth factor and morphogen receptors), syndecans can nonetheless signal to the cytoplasm in discrete ways. Syndecan expression levels are upregulated in development, tissue repair and an array of human diseases, which has led to the increased appreciation that they may be important in pathogenesis not only as diagnostic or prognostic agents, but also as potential targets. Here, their functions in development and inflammatory diseases are summarized, including their potential roles as conduits for viral pathogen entry into cells.","Gopal, Sandeep; Arokiasamy, Samantha; Pataki, Csilla; Whiteford, James R.; Couchman, John R.",Open biology,225,21

Although it has been reported that some COVID‐19 patients showed elevated liver biochemistries, there are few studies regarding clinical features and prognosis of these patients. In this multicenter, retrospective study, we collected data on laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19 patients from three hospitals in Wuhan, China, who died or were discharged between February 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020. The data on demographics, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations on admission, complications, treatment, and outcome were collected. A total of 482 patients were enrolled in this study. Of those, 142 (29.5%) patients showed abnormal liver biochemistries on admission, and patients with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (TBIL) accounted for 67.6%, 69.0%, and 16.2%, respectively. Those with abnormal liver biochemistries showed higher percentages of severe cases and comorbidities and were more likely to have dyspnea, chest distress or pain, and increased hemoglobin (Hb) on admission. Higher rates of complications and mortality and worse recovery when discharged were observed in patients with abnormal AST or TBIL. The multivariable regression analysis showed that chest distress or pain (odds ratio [OR], 1.765; P = 0.018), dyspnea (OR, 2.495; P = 0.001), elevated C‐reactive protein [CRP] level (OR, 1.007; P = 0.008), elevated white blood count (WBC) (OR, 1.139; P = 0.013), and elevated Hb concentration (OR, 1.024; P = 0.001) were independent factors associated with elevated liver biochemistries in COVID‐19 patients. Conclusion: Elevated liver biochemistries were common in COVID‐19 patients. Patients with hypoxia or severe inflammation are more likely to experience increased liver biochemistries on admission.

There are tremendous ongoing efforts for the aim of developing drugs against the COVID-19 syndrome-associated inflammation. However, currently no specific medicine is present for the absolute pharmacological cure of COVID-19 mucositis. The re-purposing/ re-positioning of already existing drugs is a very important strategy for the management of ongoing pandemy since the development of a new drug needs decades. Apart from altering angiotensin signaling pathways, novel drug candidates for re-purposing comprise medications shall target COVID-19 pathobiology, including pharmaceutical formulations that antagonize proteinase-activated receptors (PARs), mainly PAR-1. Activation of the PAR-1, mediators and hormones impact on the hemostasis, endothelial activation, alveolar epithelial cells and mucosal inflammatory responses which are the essentials of the COVID-19 pathophysiology. In this context, Ankaferd hemostat (Ankaferd Blood Stopper, ABS) which is an already approved hemostatic agent affecting via vital erythroid aggregation and fibrinogen gamma could be a potential topical remedy for the mucosal management of COVID-19. ABS is a clinically safe effective topical hemostatic agent of plant origin capable of exerting pleiotropic effects on the endothelial cells, angiogenesis, cell proliferation and vascular dynamics. ABS had been approved as a topically applied hemostatic agent for the management of post-surgical/dental bleedings and healing of infected inflammatory mucosal wounds. The anti-inflammatory and proteinase-activated receptor axis properties of ABS with a considerable amount of oestrogenic hormone presence highlight this unique topical hemostatic drug regarding the clinical re-positioning for COVID-19-associated mucositis. Topical ABS as a biological response modifier may lessen SARS-CoV-2 associated microthrombosis, endothelial dysfunction, oropharyngeal inflammation and mucosal lung damage. Moreover, PAR-1 inhibition ability of ABS might be helpful for reducing the initial virus propagation and mocasal spread of COVID-19.","Beyazit, Fatma; Beyazit, Yavuz; Tanoglu, Alpaslan; Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim C.",Med Hypotheses,225,20

With sufficient sequencing depth, it is now possible to detect subtle variations between members of the same species, or between mixed species with shared biomarkers, such as the 16S rRNA gene. However, traditional sequencing analyses of samples from largely homogeneous populations are often still based on multiple sequence alignments (MSA), where each sequence is placed along a separate row and similarities between aligned bases can be followed down each column. While this visual format is intuitive for a small set of aligned sequences, the representation quickly becomes cumbersome as sequencing depths cover loci hundreds or thousands of reads deep. FINDINGS: We have developed ANDES, a software library and a suite of applications, written in Perl and R, for the statistical ANalyses of DEep Sequencing. The fundamental data structure underlying ANDES is the position profile, which contains the nucleotide distributions for each genomic position resultant from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Tools include the root mean square deviation (RMSD) plot, which allows for the visual comparison of multiple samples on a position-by-position basis, and the computation of base conversion frequencies (transition/transversion rates), variation (Shannon entropy), inter-sample clustering and visualization (dendrogram and multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot), threshold-driven consensus sequence generation and polymorphism detection, and the estimation of empirically determined sequencing quality values. CONCLUSIONS: As new sequencing technologies evolve, deep sequencing will become increasingly cost-efficient and the inter and intra-sample comparisons of largely homogeneous sequences will become more common. We have provided a software package and demonstrated its application on various empirically-derived datasets.

Dr. Alain Gagnon Chair, Abstract Program Committee Methods We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study using the United States' Nationwide Inpatient Sample to evaluate the risk of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears in women who underwent IOL at term between 2005 and 2014. We included all term livebirths and excluded, preterm births, previous cesarean deliveries, multifetal gestations, and non-cephalic presentation. Women who underwent an IOL at term were identified using ICD-9 coding. Patient characteristics were compared between those women being induced at term with those who weren't, and logistic regression analysis were carried out to estimate the adjusted effect of IOL at term with risk of 3rd and 4th perineal tears. Results Among 5,982,945 eligible live births, 1,035,003 (17.3%) underwent an IOL at term, increasing from 15.7% to 18.5%. Women with an IOL were more likely to be older, Caucasian, and with comorbid illnesses. Compared with women who did not undergo an IOL, women in the IOL group had lower risk of cesarean deliveries, 0.89 (0.88–0.89), 2nd degree tears, 0.89 (0.89–0.90), 3rd degree tears, OR 0.81 (95% CI 0.79–0.82) and 4th degree tears, OR 0.84 (95% CI 0.82–0.87). Conclusions Induction of labor at term results in significantly lower risk of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears among all deliveries as well as among women with vaginal deliveries.","Al-Wahaibi, Suhaila; Czuzoj-Shulman, Nicholas; Abenhaim, Haim",Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada,225,24

The optimal implant design and alignment depends on the patient’s anatomy and patient-specific functional parameters such as the pelvic tilt. The approaches proposed in literature often consider one or more criteria for THA planning. but to the best of our knowledge none of them follow an integrated approach including all criteria for the definition of a patient-specific combined target zone (PSCTZ). Questions/purposes (1) How can we calculate suitable THA implant and implantation parameters for a specific patient considering all relevant criteria? (2) Are the resulting target zones in the range of conventional safe zones? (3) Do patients who fulfil these combined criteria have a better outcome score? Methods A method is presented that calculates individual target zones based on the morphology, range of motion and load acting on the hip joint and merges them into the PSCTZ. In a retrospective analysis of 198 THA patients, it was calculated whether the patients were inside or outside the Lewinnek safe zone, Dorr combined anteversion range and PSCTZ. The postoperative Harris Hip Scores (HHS) between insiders and outsiders were compared. Results 11 patients were inside the PSCTZ. Patients inside and outside the PSCTZ showed no significant difference in the HHS. However, a significant higher HHS was observed for the insiders of two of the three sub-target zones incorporated in the PSCTZ. By combining the sub-target zones in the PSCTZ, all PSCTZ insiders except one had an HHS higher than 90. Conclusions The results might suggest that, for a prosthesis implanted in the PSCTZ a low outcome score of the patient is less likely than using the conventional safe zones by Lewinnek and Dorr. For future studies, a larger cohort of patients inside the PSCTZ is needed which can only be achieved if the cases are planned prospectively with the method introduced in this paper. Clinical Relevance The method presented in this paper could help the surgeon combining multiple different criteria during THA planning and find the suitable implant design and alignment for a specific patient. The liquid-based cytology evaluation of oral tissue may provide a novel preventive medical avenue against COVID-19.","Habor, J.; Fischer, M. C.

LIGHT was recently shown to play a major role in COVID19 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), reducing mortality and hospital stay. This study aims to investigate the associations of LIGHT and IL-18 with non-COVID19 related ARDS, acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF) or acute kidney injury (AKI), secondary to viral or bacterial sepsis. Research Design and Methods A cohort of 280 subjects diagnosed with sepsis, including 91 cases with sepsis triggered by viral infections, were investigated in this study and compared to healthy controls. Serum LIGHT, IL-18, and 59 other biomarkers (cytokines, chemokines and acute-phase reactants) were measured and associated with symptom severity. Results ARDS was observed in 36% of the patients, with 29% of the total patient cohort developing multi-organ failure (failure of two or more organs). We observed significantly increased LIGHT level (>2SD above mean of healthy subjects) in both bacterial sepsis patients (P=1.80E-05) and patients with sepsis from viral infections (P=1.78E-03). In bacterial sepsis, increased LIGHT level associated with ARDS, AKI and higher Apache III scores, findings also supported by correlations of LIGHT with other biomarkers of organ failures, suggesting LIGHT may be an inflammatory driver. IL-18 levels were highly variable across individuals, and consistently correlated with Apache III scores, mortality, and AKI, in both bacterial and viral sepsis. Conclusions For the first time, we demonstrate independent effects of LIGHT and IL-18 in septic organ failures. LIGHT levels are significantly elevated in non-COVID19 sepsis patients with ARDS and/or multi-organ failures suggesting that anti-LIGHT therapy may be effective therapy in a subset of patients with sepsis. Given the large variance of plasma IL-18 among septic subjects, targeting this pathway raises opportunities that require a precision application.","Qu, H.-Q.; Qu, J.; Dunn, T.; Snyder, J.; Miano, T.

Targeting the coronavirus’ main protease (key enzyme: 3CLpro) is growing in importance in anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery process. The present study aims at predicting the antiviral activity of two novel compounds using in silico approaches that might become potential leads against SARS-CoV-2. The 3D structures of the new compounds are elucidated by single-crystal X-ray techniques. The interactions between different units of 4 and 5 were emphasized by analyzing their corresponding Hirshfeld surfaces and ESP plots. NBO and FMO analyses were investigated as well. Molecular docking combined with molecular dynamics simulations (MDs) was performed to investigate the binding modes and molecular interactions of 4 and 5 with the amino acids of coronavirus main protease (6LU7) protein. The best docking scores were obtained for both ligands through the major binding interactions via hydrogen/hydrophobic bonds with the key amino acids in the active site: HIS41, CYS145, MET49, MET165, HIS172, and GLU166 amino acids.

The causative agents of global heterogeneity in the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 are not well characterized due to the lack of comparative study of a large enough sample size from around the globe to reduce the standard deviation to the acceptable margin of error. To better understand the SARS-CoV-2 genome architecture, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of codon usage bias of sixty (60) strains to get a snapshot of its global heterogeneity. Our study shows a relatively low codon usage bias in the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome globally, with nearly all the over-preferred codons’ A.U. ended. We concluded that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is primarily shaped by mutation pressure; however, marginal selection pressure cannot be overlooked. Within the A/U rich virus genomes of SARS-CoV-2, the standard deviation in G.C. (42.91% ± 5.84%) and the GC3 value (30.14% ± 6.93%) points towards global heterogeneity of the virus. Several SARS-CoV-2 viral strains were originated from different viral lineages at the exact geographic location also supports this fact. Taking all together, these findings suggest that the general root ancestry of the global genomes are different with different genome’s level adaptation to host. This research may provide new insights into the codon patterns, host adaptation, and global heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2.","Khattak, Saadullah; Rauf, Mohd Ahmar; Zaman, Qamar; Ali, Yasir; Fatima, Shabeen; Muhammad, Pir; Li, Tao; Khan, Hamza Ali; Khan, Azhar Abbas; Ngowi, Ebenezeri Erasto; Wu, Dong-Dong; Ji, Xin-Ying",Biomolecules,225,1

Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can provide an early warning signal of COVID-19 infections in a community. The capacity of the world's environmental microbiology and virology laboratories for SARS-CoV-2 RNA characterization in wastewater is increasing rapidly. However, there are no standardized protocols or harmonized quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures for SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance. This paper is a technical review of factors that can cause false-positive and false-negative errors in the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, culminating in recommended strategies that can be implemented to identify and mitigate these errors. Recommendations include stringent QA/QC measures, representative sampling approaches, effective virus concentration and efficient RNA extraction, amplification inhibition assessment, inclusion of sample processing controls, and considerations for RT-PCR assay selection and data interpretation. Clear data interpretation guidelines (e.g., determination of positive and negative samples) are critical, particularly when the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is low. Corrective and confirmatory actions must be in place for inconclusive results or results diverging from current trends (e.g., initial onset or reemergence of COVID-19 in a community). It is also prudent to perform interlaboratory comparisons to ensure results' reliability and interpretability for prospective and retrospective analyses. The strategies that are recommended in this review aim to improve SARS-CoV-2 characterization and detection for wastewater surveillance applications. A silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic is that the efficacy of wastewater surveillance continues to be demonstrated during this global crisis. In the future, wastewater should also play an important role in the surveillance of a range of other communicable diseases.","Ahmed, Warish; Simpson, Stuart L.; Bertsch, Paul M.; Bibby, Kyle; Bivins, Aaron; Blackall, Linda L.; Bofill-Mas, Sílvia; Bosch, Albert; Brandão, João; Choi, Phil M.; Ciesielski, Mark; Donner, Erica; D'Souza, Nishita; Farnleitner, Andreas H.; Gerrity, Daniel; Gonzalez, Raul; Griffith, John F.; Gyawali, Pradip; Haas, Charles N.; Hamilton, Kerry A.; Hapuarachchi, Hapuarachchige Chanditha; Harwood, Valerie J.; Haque, Rehnuma; Jackson, Greg; Khan, Stuart J.; Khan, Wesaal; Kitajima, Masaaki; Korajkic, Asja; La Rosa, Giuseppina; Layton, Blythe A.; Lipp, Erin; McLellan, Sandra; McMinn, Brian; Medema, Gertjan; Metcalfe, Suzanne; Meijer, Wim G.; Mueller, Jochen F.; Murphy, Heather; Naughton, Coleen C.; Noble, Rachel T.; Payyappat, Sudhi; Petterson, Susan; Pitkänen, Tarja; Rajal, Veronica B.; Reyneke, Brandon; Roman, Fernando A.; Rose, Joan B.; Rusiñol, Marta; Sadowsky, Michael J.; Sala-Comorera, Laura; Setoh, Yin Xiang; Sherchan, Samendra; Sirikanchana, Kwanrawee; Smith, Wendy; Steele, Joshua; Subburg, Rosalie; Symonds, Erin M.; Thai, Phong; Thomas, Kevin V.; Tynan, Josh; Toze, Simon; Thompson, Janelle; Whiteley, Andy S.; Wong, Judith Chui Ching; Sano, Daisuke; Wuertz, Stefan; Xagoraraki, Irene; Zhang, Qian; Zimmer-Faust, Amity G.; Shanks, Orin C.",Sci Total Environ,225,26

While data regarding nutrition in coronavirus infection (COVID-19) are not available, in this review, we aimed to evaluated evidence from previous clinical trials that evaluated nutrition-based interventions for viral diseases (with special emphasis on respiratory infections), and summaries our observations. Methods A systematic search strategy was employed using keywords to search the literature in 3 key medical databases: PubMed®, Web of Science® and SciVerse Scopus®. Studies were considered eligible if they were controlled trials in humans, measuring immunological parameters, on viral and respiratory infections. Clinical trials on vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals and probiotics were included. Results total of 640 records were identified initially and 22 studies were included from other sources. After excluding duplicates and articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 43 studies were obtained (vitamins: 13; minerals: 8; nutraceuticals: 18 and probiotics: 4). Among vitamins, A and D showed a potential benefit, especially in deficient populations. Among trace elements, selenium and zinc have also shown favourable immune-modulatory effects in viral respiratory infections. Several nutraceuticals and probiotics may have some role in enhancing immune functions. Micronutrients may be beneficial in nutritionally depleted elderly population. Conclusions We summaries possible benefits of some vitamins, trace elements, nutraceuticals and and probiotics.

In this work, triboelectric nanogenerator for respiratory sensing (RS-TENG) has been designed and integrated with facemask, which endows the latter with respiratory monitoring function. The output of RS-TENG for respiratory flow can reach up to about 8 V and 0.8 μA respectively although it varies with different respiratory status, which proves the high sensitivity of RS-TENG for respiratory monitoring. An apnea alarm system can be constructed by combining the smart facemask with circuit modules so that timely alarm can be transmitted after people stop breathing. Furthermore, RS-TENG can be used to control household appliances, which brings convenience to the life of the disabled people. Considering its incomparable advantages such as small volume, easy fabrication, simple installation and economical applicability, such design is helpful for developing multifunctional health monitoring gadgets during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lu, Qixin; Chen, Hong; Zeng, Yuanming; Xue, Jiehui; Cao, Xia; Wang, Ning; Wang, Zhonglin",Nano Energy,225,11

Recovery housing is a residential service, and it relies heavily on social support provided by peers both within the residence and in outside mutual help groups. As such, efforts to keep residents safe from SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes the illness COVID-19, pose a number of challenges to social distancing. Further, residents are some of the more vulnerable individuals in recovery. They are more likely to have co-occurring health conditions that place them at risk for COVID-19, and they often have risk factors such as employment in low-wage jobs that increase their potential for negative economic impacts of the pandemic. Since most recovery housing operates outside formal substance use treatment, residents who pay out-of-pocket for services largely support these residences. Comprehensive support for those using, as well as those providing and ensuring the quality of recovery housing, is needed to ensure the viability of recovery housing.","Mericle, Amy A.; Sheridan, Dave; Howell, Jason; Braucht, George S.; Karriker-Jaffe, Katherine; Polcin, Douglas L.",J Subst Abuse Treat,225,24

Firstly, dialysis patients appear to be at increased risk for infection due to viral transmission next to an enhanced risk for mortality as compared to the general population, even in the face of an often apparently mild clinical presentation. Derangements in the innate and adaptive immune systems may be responsible for a reduced antiviral response, whereas chronic activation of the innate immune system and endothelial dysfunction provide a background for a more severe course. The presence of severe comorbidity, older age, and a reduction of organ reserve may lead to a rapid deterioration of the clinical situation of the patients in case of severe infection. Secondly, patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), which is related to the severity of the clinical disease. The presence of AKI, and especially the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), is associated with an increased risk of mortality. AKI in COVID-19 has a multifactorial origin, in which direct viral invasion of kidney cells, activation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, a hyperinflammatory response, hypercoagulability, and nonspecific factors such as hypotension and hypoxemia may be involved. Apart from logistic challenges and the need for strict hygiene within units, treatment of patients with ESRD and COVID-19 is not different from that of the general population. Extracorporeal treatment of patients with AKI with RRT can be complicated by frequent filter clotting due to the hypercoagulable state, for which regional citrate coagulation provides a reasonable solution. Also, acute peritoneal dialysis may be a reasonable option in these patients. Whether adjuncts to extracorporeal therapies, such as hemoadsorption, provide additional benefits in the case of severely ill COVID-19 patients needs to be addressed in controlled studies.","Kooman, Jeroen P.; van der Sande, Frank M.",Blood Purif,225,16

However, such measures may increase the risk of loneliness. The current study aimed to investigate (a) whether social distancing measures, particularly limiting close social interactions, are associated with loneliness among older adults, and (b) whether the association between social distancing measures and loneliness is moderated by sociodemographic characteristics. METHOD: Data were from the fourth wave (April 29 to May 26, 2020) of the nationally representative Understanding America Study COVID-19 Survey. We used data on adults 50 years or older (N = 3,253). Logistic regression models of loneliness were performed. Five indicators of social distancing measures were considered: (a) avoiding public spaces, gatherings, or crowds; (b) canceling or postponing social activities; (c) social visits; (d) no close contact (within 6 feet) with people living together; and (e) with people not living together. RESULTS: Cancelling or postponing social activities and avoiding close contact with people living together were associated with 33% (odds ratio [OR] = 1.33, confidence interval [CI] = 1.06−1.68, p < .05) and 47% (OR = 1.47, CI = 1.09−1.99, p < .05) greater odds of loneliness, respectively. Furthermore, limiting close contact with coresidents increased the probability of loneliness more for males, non-Hispanic Whites, and those with higher levels of education and income. DISCUSSION: Efforts should be made to help older adults maintain social connectedness with close others by virtual communication methods. Our findings also call special attention to vulnerable groups at elevated risks of loneliness, emphasizing the need for tailored interventions.","Choi, Eun Young; Farina, Mateo P; Wu, Qiao; Ailshire, Jennifer",J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci,225,9

Gastrointestinal/hepatic sequelae such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and elevated liver enzymes have been reported as well. Studies and data so far on coronavirus infections from China, Singapore, and other countries showed that liver enzymes elevation could be seen in 20-50% of cases. More severe disease can correlate with the worsening of liver enzymes. However, acute liver failure in patients with COVID-19 has not been described.

The goal of this study was to investigate the survival and kidney outcomes of these patients. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients (aged ≥18 years) hospitalized with COVID-19 at 13 hospitals in metropolitan New York between March 1, 2020, and April 27, 2020, followed up until hospital discharge. EXPOSURE: AKI. OUTCOMES: Primary outcome: in-hospital death. Secondary outcomes: requiring dialysis at discharge, recovery of kidney function. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Univariable and multivariable time-to-event analysis and logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 9,657 patients admitted with COVID-19, the AKI incidence rate was 38.4/1,000 patient-days. Incidence rates of in-hospital death among patients without AKI, with AKI not requiring dialysis (AKI stages 1-3), and with AKI receiving dialysis (AKI 3D) were 10.8, 31.1, and 37.5/1,000 patient-days, respectively. Taking those without AKI as the reference group, we observed greater risks for in-hospital death for patients with AKI 1-3 and AKI 3D (HRs of 5.6 [95% CI, 5.0-6.3] and 11.3 [95% CI, 9.6-13.1], respectively).

Commercial transport, and especially last mile delivery is expected to grow because of the rise of e-commerce. In this frame, electric light commercial vehicles (eLCVs) can be a promising low-emission solution. Literature holistically analysing the potential of eLCVs as well as related support policies is sparse. This paper attempts to close this research gap. To this aim, the total cost of ownership (TCO) comparisons for eLCVs and benchmark vehicles are performed and support measures that target the improvement of the eLCV TCO are analysed. Various eLCV deployment scenarios until 2030 are explored and their impact on carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and other pollutant emissions as well as pollutant concentrations are calculated. It is found that while in several European Union (EU) countries eLCVs are already cost competitive, because of fiscal support, some remaining market barriers need to be overcome to pave the way to mass market deployment of eLCVs. High penetration of eLCVs alone can lead to a reduction of total transport CO(2) emissions by more than 3% by 2030. For pollutant emissions, such as nitrogen oxide (NO(x)) and particulate matter (PM), the reduction would be equal or even higher. In the case of PM, this can translate to reductions in concentrations by nearly 2% in several urban areas by 2030. Carefully designed support policies could help to ensure that the potential of eLCVs as a low-emission alternative is fully leveraged in the EU.","Tsakalidis, Anastasios; Krause, Jette; Julea, Andreea; Peduzzi, Emanuela; Pisoni, Enrico; Thiel, Christian",Transp Res D Transp Environ,225,7

The hypothesis is that a significant reduction in the number of emergent appendectomies was observed during the pandemic, restricted to complex cases. The study aimed to analyse emergent surgical appendectomies during pandemic on a national basis and compare it to the same period of the previous year. This is a multicentre, retrospective, observational study investigating the outcomes of patients undergoing emergent appendectomy in March–April 2019 vs March–April 2020. The primary outcome was the number of appendectomies performed, classified according to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) score. Secondary outcomes were the type of surgical technique employed (laparoscopic vs open) and the complication rates. One thousand five hundred forty one patients with acute appendicitis underwent surgery during the two study periods. 1337 (86.8%) patients met the inclusion criteria: 546 (40.8%) patients underwent surgery for acute appendicitis in 2020 and 791 (59.2%) in 2019. According to AAST, patients with complicated appendicitis operated in 2019 were 30.3% vs 39.9% in 2020 (p = 0.001). We observed an increase in the number of post-operative complications in 2020 (15.9%) compared to 2019 (9.6%) (p < 0.001). The following determinants increased the likelihood of complication occurrence: undergoing surgery during 2020 (+ 67%), the increase of a unit in the AAST score (+ 26%), surgery performed > 24 h after admission (+ 58%), open surgery (+ 112%) and conversion to open surgery (+ 166%). In Italian hospitals, in March and April 2020, the number of appendectomies has drastically dropped.

This follows an initial systematic literature review of existing skills and competencies and a job listing analysis. Methods An iterative approach was applied to framework development. Using a mixed-methods design we carried out semi-structured interviews with participants involved in informatics (n=15). The framework was updated based on the interview findings and was subsequently distributed as part of a bespoke online digital survey for wider participation (n=87). The final version of the framework is based on the findings of the survey. RESULTS: Over 102 people reviewed the framework as part of the interview or survey process. This led to a final core competency framework containing 6 primary domains with 36 subdomains containing 111 individual competencies. CONCLUSIONS: An iterative mixed-methods approach for competency development involving the target community was appropriate for development of the competency framework. There is some contention around the depth of technical competencies required. Care is also needed to avoid professional burnout, as clinicians and healthcare practitioners already have clinical competencies to maintain. Therefore, how the framework is applied in practice and how practitioners meet the competencies requires careful consideration.","Davies, Alan; Mueller, Julia; Hassey, Alan; Moulton, Georgina",BMJ Health Care Inform,225,1

The masks are accepted by the public. People with a pollen allergy have an interest in knowing whether masks can also provide protection against pollen and thus prevent symptoms even without medication. METHOD: In order to evaluate the potential ‘antipollen effect’ of face masks, 14 adults with confirmed grass pollen-induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis were exposed to grass pollen for a period of two hours following a standardised protocol. The test was conducted outside of the grass pollen season. The subjects wore either no mask, a medical mask or a FFP2 mask. RESULTS: Subjects wearing either mask were clearly able to avoid both nasal and conjunctival symptoms. There were no significant differences between the two masks in terms of effect. Mask wearing to prevent pollen exposure clearly supports overall well-being. CONCLUSION: Wearing a mask during pollen season can be recommended as an effective nondrug option for people with a pollen allergy.

Detection test on plant diseases in the laboratory can be laborious, time consuming, expensive, and normally requires specific technical expertise. Moreover, in the developing countries, it is often difficult to find laboratories equipped for this kind of analysis. Therefore, in the past years, a high effort has been made for the development of fast, specific, sensitive, and cost-effective tests that can be successfully used in plant pathology directly in the field by low-specialized personnel using minimal equipment. Nucleic acid-based methods have proven to be a good choice for the development of detection tools in several fields, such as human/animal health, food safety, and water analysis, and their application in plant pathogen detection is becoming more and more common. In the present review, the more recent nucleic acid-based protocols for point-of-care (POC) plant pathogen detection and identification are described and analyzed. All these methods have a high potential for early detection of destructive diseases in agriculture and forestry, they should help make molecular detection for plant pathogens accessible to anyone, anywhere, and at any time. We do not suggest that on-site methods should replace lab testing completely, which remains crucial for more complex researches, such as identification and classification of new pathogens or the study of plant defense mechanisms. Instead, POC analysis can provide a useful, fast, and efficient preliminary on-site screening that is crucial in the struggle against plant pathogens.","Baldi, Paolo; La Porta, Nicola",Front Plant Sci,225,1

While death is not uncommon in critical care, the international experience demonstrates that restrictions to family presence at the end of life result in significant distress for families and clinicians. As a result, the Australian College of Critical Care Nurses and the Australasian College for Infection Prevention and Control supported the development of a position statement to provide critical care nurses with specific guidance and recommendations for practice for this emerging priority area. Where possible, position statements are founded on high-quality evidence. However, the short time period since the first recognition of a cluster of pneumonia-like cases in China in January, 2020 meant that an integrative approach was required to expedite timely development of this position statement in preparation for a COVID-19 surge in Australia.

We used eight experimental groups of male albino rats: vehicle, azithromycin (100 mg/kg), clarithromycin (100 mg/kg), erythromycin (100 mg/kg), MI + vehicle, MI + azithromycin (100 mg/kg), MI + clarithromycin (100 mg/kg) and MI + erythromycin (100 mg/kg); each group received chronic oral doses of the vehicle/drugs for seven weeks. ECG abnormalities and elevated serum cardiac enzymes were observed particularly in rats with AMI compared to healthy rats. Microscopic examination revealed elevated pathology scores for rats treated with clarithromycin in both experiments following treatment with erythromycin in healthy rats. Although rats with MI did not show further elevations in fibrosis score on treatment with macrolides, they produced significant fibrosis in healthy rats. Downregulation of cardiac Nav1.5 transcript was observed following macrolides treatment in both groups (healthy rats and rats with MI). In conclusion, the current findings suggested the potential cardiotoxic effects of chronic doses of macrolide antibiotics in rats with MI as manifested by abnormal ECG changes and pathological findings in addition to downregulation of Nav1.5 channels. Furthermore, in the current dose ranges, azithromycin produced the least toxicity compared to clarithromycin and erythromycin.","Farag, Noha E.; El-Kherbetawy, Mohamed K.; Ismail, Hussein M.; Abdelrady, Ahmed M.; Toraih, Eman A.; Abdelbasset, Walid Kamal; Lashine, Rehab M.; EL-dosoky, Mohammed; Abed, Sally Yussef; Ibraheem, Khalid M.; Fawzy, Manal S.; Zaitone, Sawsan A.",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),225,29

Design: 2 by 3 experimental design. Setting: Online with data collected between 28th April and 1st May 2020. Participants: 1,204 adults registered with a UK research panel. Intervention: Participants were randomised to receive one of six descriptions of an antibody test and results showing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, differing in the terms used to describe the type of test (Immunity vs Antibody) and the test result (Passport vs Certificate vs Test). Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of participants perceiving no risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 given an antibody positive test result. Other outcomes include intended changes to frequency of hand washing and physical distancing. Results: When using the term Immunity (vs Antibody), 19.1% of participants [95% CI: 16.1 to 22.5] (vs 9.8% [95% CI: 7.5 to 12.4]) perceived no risk of catching coronavirus at some point in the future given an antibody-positive test result (AOR: 2.91 [95% CI: 1.52 to 5.55]). Using the terms Passport or Certificate, as opposed to Test, had no significant effect (AOR: 1.24 [95% CI: 0.62 to 2.48] and AOR: 0.96 [95% CI: 0.47 to 1.99] respectively). There was no significant interaction between the effects of the test and result terminology. Across groups, perceiving no risk of infection was associated with an intention to wash hands less frequently (AOR: 2.32 [95% CI: 1.25 to 4.28]) but there was no significant association with intended avoidance of physical contact with others outside of the home (AOR: 1.37 [95% CI: 0.93 to 2.03]). Conclusions: Using the term Immunity (vs Antibody) to describe antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 increases the proportion of people believing that an antibody-positive result means they have no risk of catching coronavirus in the future, a perception that may be associated with less frequent hand washing.

The baseline leukocyte count, neutrophil count and hemoglobin was significantly higher in non-survivors compared with survivors, while the reverse was true of lymphocyte count, platelet, PaO(2)/FiO(2), CD3+ count and CD4+ count. The percentage of neutrophil count > 6.3×10(9)/L in death group was significantly higher than that in survival group, and multivariate logistic regression showed neutrophil count > 6.3×10(9)/L was independently associated with mortality. However, there were not significant difference in IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C4 and the percentage of IgE > 100 IU/ml between the death group and survival group.

Objective To provide an easy access to and a trustful review of the main aspects that have changed in the head and neck surgery and otorhinolaryngology practice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data Synthesis The search terms used were: ( head and neck or otorhinolaryngology or ORL or thyroid ) AND ( severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [ SARS-COV-2] or COVID-19 or CORONAVIRUS ). The results were limited to the year of 2020. Articles were read in English, Portuguese, French, German, and Spanish or translated from Chinese. All included articles were read by at least two authors. Thirty-five articles were included. Most articles suggest postponing elective surgeries, with exception to cancer surgeries, which should be evaluated separately. Twenty-five articles recommended some kind of screening prior to surgery, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and epidemiological data. Extra precautions, such as use of personal protective equipment (PPE), are suggested for both tracheostomies and endoscopies. Fifteen articles give recommendation on how to use telemedicine. Conclusion The use of PPE (N95 or powered air-purifying respirator [PAPR]) during procedures should be mandatory. Patients should be evaluated about their COVID-19 status before hospital admission.

Little is known on the frequency and the nature of persistent symptoms beyond 3 months. Here we have assessed, in the longitudinal prospective French COVID-19 cohort, symptoms that persisted 6 months after admission for COVID-19. METHODS: Hospitalized patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. Follow-up was planned with a physician's visit at month (M)3 and M6 after admission. Associations between persistence of symptoms at M6 and clinical characteristics at admission were assessed through bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: M6 data were available for 1137 participants. Median age was 61 years (IQR 51–71) and 288 (29%, 95% CI 26–32%) were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) during the acute phase. Six hundred and fifty-five (68%, 95% CI 65–71%) and 639 (60%, 95% CI 57–63%) participants had at least one symptom at M3 and M6 visit, respectively, mostly fatigue, dyspnoea, joint pain and myalgia. At M6, 255 (24%, 95% CI 21–27%) of participants had three or more persistent symptoms.

Initial treatment with 0.3–1.0 mg/kg prednisone resulted in improvement in symptoms, in radiographic findings, and in pulmonary function testing for the majority of patients. Six patients had recurrence of OP after completing treatment. Eleven patients had evidence of extra-pulmonary graft-versus-host disease prior to diagnosis of OP, and seven patients were diagnosed with an upper respiratory tract infection (URI) within 8 weeks of OP diagnosis. Most patients respond well to prednisone with significant improvement in pulmonary function, but risk of recurrence is high after cessation of steroid treatment. Risk factors for the development of OP may include prior URI.","Brownback, Kyle R.; Frey, John W.; Abhyankar, Sunil",Ann Hematol,225,1

Method We evaluated lymphocyte subsets and other clinical features of COVID-19 patients and analysed their potential impacts on COVID-19 outcomes. Results 1. Lymphocyte subset counts in the peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 were significantly reduced, especially in patients with severe disease. 2. In patients with non-severe diseases, the time from symptom onset to hospital admission was positively correlated with total T cell counts. 3. Among COVID-19 patients who did not reach the composite endpoint, lymphocyte subset counts were higher than in patients who had reached the composite endpoint. 4. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed significant differences in COVID-19 patients, classified by the levels of total, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells at admission. Conclusion Our study shows that the total, CD8+ and CD4+ T cell counts in patients with COVID-19 were significantly reduced, especially in patients with severe disease. T lymphocyte subsets were significantly associated with a higher occurrence of composite endpoint events. These subsets may help identify patients with a high risk of composite endpoint events.","Zhang, Wenjing; Li, Lei; Liu, Jihai; Chen, Li; Zhou, Fangfang; Jin, Ting; Jiang, Lin; Li, Xiang; Yang, Ming; Wang, Hongxiang",Int J Infect Dis,225,20

Our aim was to develop and evaluate an emergency system for monitoring patients with COVID-19, which may be useful in hospitals where more severe patients stay in their homes. Methodology/Principal findings The system consists of the home-based patient unit, which is set up around the patient and the hospital unit, which enables the medical staff to telemonitor the patients condition and help to send medical recommendations. The home unit allows the data transmission from the patient to the hospital, which is performed using a cell phone application. The hospital unit includes a virtual instrument developed in LabVIEW environment that is able to provide a real-time monitoring of the oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), beats per minute (BPM), body temperature (BT) and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Abnormal events may be fast and automatically identified. After the design details are described, the system is validated by a 30-day home monitoring study in 12 controls and 12 patients with COVID-19 presenting asymptomatic to mild disease. Patients presented reduced SpO 2 (p<0.0001) and increased BPM values (p<0.0001). Three patients (25%) presented PEF values between 50 and 80% of the predicted. Three of the 12 monitored patients presented events of desaturation (SpO 2 <92%). The experimental results were in close agreement with the involved pathophysiology, providing clear evidences that the proposed system can be a useful tool for the remote monitoring of patients with COVID-19. Conclusions An emergency system for home monitoring of patients with COVID-19 was developed in the current study. The proposed system allowed us to quickly respond to early abnormalities in these patients. This system may contribute to conserve hospital resources for those most in need, while simultaneously enabling early recognition of patients under acute deterioration, requiring urgent assessment.","Motta, L.

METHODS An on-site face-to-face survey of adults aged 18 or older (n = 7261) was conducted from November to December, 2020 in China, and this survey selected six provinces based on the geographic location. RESULTS In the total sample, 82.5% reported that they would intend to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Compared with Hubei province, respondents' intentions to get vaccinated decreased by 70% in Zhejiang, 61% in Guangdong, 87% in Gansu, and 71% in Jilin, respectively. However, within Hubei province, compared with Wuhan city, respondents' intentions to get vaccinated in other cities were not significantly different. Respondents with higher perceived risk of infection were associated with increased odds of intentions to get vaccinated against COVID-19. CONCLUSION Our study identified priority geographic regions that need to pay attention on the vaccination campaign and help design effective immunization strategies to increase the vaccine uptake against COVID-19. More attention should be paid to adults residing farther from the epicenter of the outbreak and having lower perceived risk of infection.","Jing, Rize; Li, Li; Guo, Jia; Song, Yifan; Geng, Shufan; Wang, Jiaohao; Zhang, Haijun; Lai, Xiaozhen; Lyu, Yun; Feng, Huangyufei; Yu, Wenzhou; Zhu, He; Fang, Hai",Expert review of vaccines,225,1

Similarly, short- and long-term outcomes vary widely. Although multiple studies have addressed outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, Community-based studies are sparse and are needed to provide a broader perspective of the lasting impact of this disease, especially lung damage. METHODS: This is a retrospective, Community-based, cohort study of residents of Rochester, Minnesota, who were enrolled in the Mayo Clinic COVID-19 database. Subjects were included if they were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection from March 01, 2020 to May 31, 2020. The clinical presentation, laboratory results, pulmonary function results, and chest imaging findings at the time of presentation and events in the following months until December 31, 2020 were assessed by review of medical records and imaging studies. RESULTS: We identified 570 community patients with COVID-19 infection;median age 38.5 years (range 18-98 years) - 526 patients did not require hospitalization while 44 (7.5%) patients (median age 51.8 years, range 20 - 81) had hypoxemia warranting admission (moderate to severe disease based on WHO clinical progression scale)[i]. At the time of hospitalization, all has undergone chest radiography, and 42 patients (95%) had chest CT with all demonstrating peripheral patchy ground glass opacities (GGOs) bilaterally.Thirteen patients (29.5%) returned for chest radiograph (median interval, 5.9 months);4 of them (13%) had residual parenchymal opacities, of whom nearly all (94%) were 45 years or older. Twenty-five patients had follow-up CT scans three months after initial diagnosis;8 patients (32%) had complete resolution of the CT infiltrates. Seventeen patients (9 females and 8 males) had residual parenchymal opacities with the most common being peripheral and bibasilar GGOs;5 patients had residual reticulonodular scarring and traction bronchiectasis on imaging. 6 patients (13.6%) underwent pulmonary function testing at follow-up visit (median interval 4.6 months), of whom 2 manifested abnormal findings consisting of mild restriction. Overall, 50% of the patients had evidence of residual lung disease (imaging and/or pulmonary function) three months after presentation. Ten patients (59%) with residual disease on chest CT had been hospitalized (six requiring ICU level of care) and manifested significantly elevated inflammatory markers (ferritin, interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein);9 out of these 10 patients with residual disease did not receive steroids at the time of hospitalization. Seven patients (41%) with residual lung infiltrates on CT scan was not hospitalized and didn’t have evidence of severe inflammatory disease. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we assessed the initial severity and outcomes of subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 in our community and found 3% to manifest persistent lung abnormalities following the acute infection. The residual radiological findings consisted mainly of GGOs affecting the peripheral zones of the lung;however, in a minority of the patients, fibrotic changes were present. Almost two thirds of the patients with persistently abnormal imaging had been hospitalized for at least two days and had high serologic inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, Ferritin and interleukin-6). This might indicate that the resultant fibrosis is mainly driven by post-inflammatory processes rather than the direct effect of the virus. conversely a considerable number of patients developed interstitial infiltrates without evidence of acute inflammatory reaction which may suggest another non-inflammatory etiology of these findings. Furthermore, most of our patients who manifested lung fibrosis on follow-up CT had not received steroids. Although the long-term course and significance of these residual radiologic findings are not established, prior data of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Se ere Acute Respiratory Syndrome suggest that most of these lesions resolve over time among those who survived hospitalization. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The results of this community-based study will provide a broader perspective of the lasting impact of COVID-19 on the lungs.

To analyze the spectrum and characteristics of neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods. We conducted a nationwide, multicentric, retrospective study during the French COVID-19 epidemic in March-April 2020. All COVID-19 patients with de novo neurological manifestations were eligible. Results. We included 222 COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations from 46 centers throughout the country. Median age was 65 years (IQR 53-72), and 136 patients (61.3%) were male. COVID-19 was severe or critical in almost half of the patients (102, 45.2%). Brain imaging was performed in 192 patients (86.5%), including 157 MRI (70.7%). Cerebrospinal fluid was analyzed in 97 patients (43.7%), with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in 2 out of 75 tested (2.7%).

Here, we discuss the potential beneficial effects of statins in COVID‐19 patients based on evidence that they may target virus receptors, replication, degradation and downstream responses in infected cells, addressing both basic research and epidemiological information. Briefly, statins could act modulating virus entry, acting on the SARS‐CoV‐2 receptors, ACE2 and CD147, and/or lipid rafts engagement. Statins, by inducing autophagy activation, could regulate virus replication or degradation, exerting protective effects. The well‐known anti‐inflammatory properties of statins, by blocking several molecular mechanisms, including NF‐κB and NLRP3 inflammasome, could limit the “cytokine storm” in severe COVID‐19 patients which is linked to fatal outcome.
