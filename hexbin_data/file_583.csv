1052,Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS): A Trust-Based Network,2013-01-25,"The Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS) network was formally established in 2001 through a Memorandum of Understanding signed by six Ministers of Health of the countries in the Greater Mekong sub-region: Cambodia, China (Yunnan and Guangxi), Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. The main areas of focus of the network are to: i) improve cross-border infectious disease outbreak investigation and response by sharing surveillance data and best practices in disease recognition and reporting, and by jointly responding to outbreaks; ii) develop expertise in epidemiological surveillance across the countries; and iii) enhance communication between the countries. Comprised of senior health officials, epidemiologists, health practitioners, and other professionals, the MBDS has grown and matured over the years into an entity based on mutual trust that can be sustained into the future. Other regions have started emulating the network's pioneering work. In this paper, we describe the development of MBDS, the way in which it operates today, and some of its achievements. We present key challenges the network has faced and lessons its members have learned about how to develop sufficient trust for health and other professionals to alert each other to disease threats across national borders and thereby more effectively combat these threats.","Phommasack, Bounlay; Jiraphongsa, Chuleeporn; Ko Oo, Moe; Bond, Katherine C.; Phaholyothin, Natalie; Suphanchaimat, Rapeepong; Ungchusak, Kumnuan; Macfarlane, Sarah B.",Emerg Health Threats J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3557908/,583

A diagnosis of infection with respiratory syncytial (R.S.) virus was made in 40%, rhinovirus in 6·1%, adenovirus in 3·7%, parainfluenza in 2·1%, enterovirus in 1·9%, and influenza in 1·3%. R.S.-virus infections were more severe than others and occurred mostly in the first five months of life, with a peak at two months. Rhinovirus infections occurred at all ages, and often involved the lower respiratory tract. Of the 12 deaths, only 1 (due to R.S. virus) was not associated with a contributory cause. Maternal antibody to R.S. virus did not notably affect the incidence or severity of R.S.-virus infections.","Jacobs, J.W.; Peacock, D.B.; Corner, B.D.; Caul, E.O.; Clarke, S.K.R.",Lancet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135715/,583

13254,"The Impact of Diet, Nutrition and Nutraceuticals on Oral and Periodontal Health",2020-09-06,"To monitor the arthropod-borne virus transmission in mosquitoes, we have attempted both to detect and isolate viruses from 3304 wild-caught female mosquitoes in the Livingstone (Southern Province) and Mongu (Western Province) regions in Zambia in 2017. A pan-flavivirus RT-PCR assay was performed to identify flavivirus genomes in total RNA extracted from mosquito lysates, followed by virus isolation and full genome sequence analysis using next-generation sequencing and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. We isolated a newly identified Barkedji virus (BJV Zambia) (10,899 nt) and a novel flavivirus, tentatively termed Barkedji-like virus (BJLV) (10,885 nt) from Culex spp. mosquitoes which shared 96% and 75% nucleotide identity with BJV which has been isolated in Israel, respectively. These viruses could replicate in C6/36 cells but not in mammalian and avian cell lines. In parallel, a comparative genomics screening was conducted to study evolutionary traits of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of isolated viruses. Bioinformatic analyses of the secondary structures in the UTRs of both viruses revealed that the 5′-UTRs exhibit canonical stem-loop structures, while the 3′-UTRs contain structural homologs to exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs), SL-III, dumbbell, and terminal stem-loop (3′SL) structures. The function of predicted xrRNA structures to stop RNA degradation by Xrn1 exoribonuclease was further proved by the in vitro Xrn1 resistance assay.","Wastika, Christida E.; Harima, Hayato; Sasaki, Michihito; Hang’ombe, Bernard M.; Eshita, Yuki; Qiu, Yongjin; Hall, William W.; Wolfinger, Michael T.; Sawa, Hirofumi; Orba, Yasuko",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7551683/,583
14333,Learning Assessment from a Lecture about Fundamentals on Basic Life Support among Undergraduate Students of Health Sciences,2020-10-01,"CD163 has been identified as the essential receptor for Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRSV), a major etiologic agent of pigs. Scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain 5–9 (SRCR5–9) in CD163 was shown to be responsible for the virus interaction. In this study, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 6E8 and 9A10 against SRCR5–9 were selected based on the significant activity to inhibit PRRSV infection in Porcine Alveolar Macrophage (PAMs) and Marc-145. Both mAbs are capable of blocking variable PRRSV strains in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, as candidates for both prevention and therapeutics, the antibodies successfully inhibit PRRSV infection and the related NF-κB pathway either before or after virus attachment. Besides, the antibody treatment with either mAb leads to a remarkable decrease of CD163 transcription in PAMs and Marc-145. It is potentially caused by the excessive accumulation of membrane associated CD163 due to the failure in CD163 cleavage with the antibody binding. Further, conformational epitopes targeted by 6E8 and 9A10 are identified to be spanning residues (570)SXDVGXV(576) in SRCR5 and Q(797) in SRCR7, respectively. CD163 with mutated epitopes expressed in 3D4 cells fails to support PRRSV infection while wild type CD163 recovers PRRSV infection, indicating the critical role of these residues in PRRSV invasion. These findings promote the understanding in the interaction between PRRSV and the receptor and provide novel broad antiviral strategies for PRRSV prevention and treatment via alternative mechanisms.","Xu, Huiling; Liu, Zehui; Zheng, Suya; Han, Guangwei; He, Fang",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7711879/,583
15411,Psychometric properties of the stress control mindset measure in university students from Australia and the UK,2020-11-24,"This case report describes an elderly patient with radioiodine-resistant differentiated thyroid cancer and additional multiple metastases living in a rural setting, remote from the specialist oncology service. This case is of interest because effective systemic therapies for treatment-resistant cancers, such as lenvatinib, are now available but can potentially cause significant toxicities that require extensive medical management. Here, we discuss how patient care was provided collaboratively by the local community teams integrated with remote specialist oncology services. A 77-year-old patient presented with symptoms of cauda equina secondary to a large metastatic sacral deposit. The deposit was biopsied, and histology revealed a diagnosis of differentiated follicular thyroid cancer that was treated with external beam radiotherapy and thyroidectomy, followed by radioiodine. However, the disease was found to be resistant to radioiodine therapy, and the patient subsequently developed back pain due to new bone metastases. After further palliative external beam radiotherapy, the patient was started on systemic treatment with lenvatinib. Treatment has continued for more than 2.5 years with a slow but steady improvement in symptoms and quality of life. Monitoring and assessment of lenvatinib therapy and management of associated toxicities was coordinated remotely from a specialist cancer center over 200 miles away, using the skills of the local medical and nursing teams. This case report demonstrates how a cooperative effort using local teams and video-conferencing links to a specialist cancer center can be applied to safely treat a patient with a medication that may result in significant potential toxicities that require attentive and dynamic management.","Wybrew, Rachael; Loynd, Michael; Wybrew, Maria; Samuel, Leslie",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883396/,583
15668,Latent Class Analysis of Multiple Health Risk Behaviors among Australian University Students and Associations with Psychological Distress,2021-01-28,"(1) Background: Psychological problems of adolescents have become a global health and safety concern. Empirical evidence has shown that adolescents experience diverse mental health conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression, and emotional disorders). However, research on anxiety-induced sleep disturbance among in-school adolescents has received less attention, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This study’s central focus was to examine factors associated with t anxiety-induced sleep disturbance among in-school adolescents in Ghana. (2) Methods: Analysis was performed using the 2012 Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS). A sample of 1342 in-school adolescents was included in the analysis. The outcome variable was anxiety-induced sleep disturbance reported during the past 12 months. Frequencies, percentages, chi-square, and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results from the multivariable logistic regression analysis were presented as crude and adjusted odds ratios at 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and with a statistical significance declared at p < 0.05. (3) Results: Adolescents who went hungry were more likely to report anxiety-induced sleep disturbance compared to their counterparts who did not report hunger (aOR = 1.68, CI = 1.10, 2.57). The odds of anxiety-induced sleep disturbance were higher among adolescents who felt lonely compared to those that never felt lonely (aOR = 2.82, CI = 1.98, 4.01). Adolescents who had sustained injury were more likely to have anxiety-induced sleep disturbance (aOR = 1.49, CI = 1.03, 2.14) compared to those who had no injury. Compared to adolescents who never had suicidal ideations, those who reported experiencing suicidal ideations had higher odds of anxiety-induced sleep disturbance (aOR = 1.68, CI = 1.05, 2.71). (4) Conclusions: Anxiety-induced sleep disturbance among in-school adolescents were significantly influenced by the psychosocial determinants such as hunger, loneliness, injury, and suicidal ideation in this study. The findings can help design appropriate interventions through effective strategies (e.g., early school-based screening, cognitive-behavioral therapy, face-face counseling services) to reduce psychosocial problems among in-school adolescents in Ghana.","Ahinkorah, Bright Opoku; Aboagye, Richard Gyan; Arthur-Holmes, Francis; Seidu, Abdul-Aziz; Frimpong, James Boadu; Budu, Eugene; Amoako, Bernard Mensah; Hagan, John Elvis",Behav Sci (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7912318/,583
16612,Needs and Preferences Among Food Pantry Clients,2021-04-01,"PURPOSE: Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, but its effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury remain uncertain. The present study explored the effects of DEX on LPS-induced lung injury and studied the possible molecular mechanisms by testing the effects of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 and BEZ235. METHODS: Seventy C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into the control, LPS, LPS + DEX, LPS + LY294002, LPS + BEZ235, LPS + DEX + LY294002, and LPS + DEX + BEZ235groups. Lung samples were collected 48 h after LPS treatment. RESULTS: DEX significantly inhibited LPS-induced increases in the lung weight/body weight ratio and lung wet/dry weight ratio, decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, and decreased the production of proinflammatory factors, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)in the lungs. DEX also markedly attenuated the increases in malondialdehyde 5 (MDA 5) and inositol-dependent enzyme a (IRE-a), attenuated the decrease in superoxide dismutase 1(SOD-1), reversed the low expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and the high expressions of Bax and Caspase-3. DEX also decreased the expression of phosphorylated PI3K and phosphorylated Akt and increased the expression of phosphorylated forkhead box-O transcription factor 1 (FoxO1). More interestingly, LY294002 or BEZ235 pretreatment significantly abolished the inhibitory effects of DEX on LPS-induced lung inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that DEX ameliorates LPS-induced acute lung injury partly through the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway.","Cui, Haibin; Zhang, Qian",J Anesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8021217/,583

Here, using glioblastoma patient-derived stem cells (GSCs), we identify and characterize a subset of Gal-3(high) glioblastoma (GBM) tumors mainly within the mesenchymal subtype that are addicted to Gal-3-mediated macropinocytosis. Using both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of Gal-3, we showed a significant decrease of GSC macropinocytosis activity, cell survival and invasion, in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Gal-3 binds to RAB10, a member of the RAS superfamily of small GTPases, and β1 integrin, which are both required for macropinocytosis activity and cell survival. Finally, by defining a Gal-3/macropinocytosis molecular signature, we could predict sensitivity to this dependency pathway and provide proof-of-principle for innovative therapeutic strategies to exploit this Achilles’ heel for a significant and unique subset of GBM patients.","Seguin, Laetitia; Odouard, Soline; Corlazzoli, Francesca; Haddad, Sarah Al; Moindrot, Laurine; Calvo Tardón, Marta; Yebra, Mayra; Koval, Alexey; Marinari, Eliana; Bes, Viviane; Guérin, Alexandre; Allard, Mathilde; Ilmjärv, Sten; Katanaev, Vladimir L.; Walker, Paul R.; Krause, Karl-Heinz; Dutoit, Valérie; Sarkaria, Jann N.; Dietrich, Pierre-Yves; Cosset, Érika",Commun Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8192788/,583
18620,Spiritual Dimensions in Leadership: A Comparative Analysis of Polish and Bhutanese Managers,2021-06-23,"In recent years, multi-omic studies have enabled resolving community structure and interrogating community function of microbial communities. Simultaneous generation of metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, metaproteomic, and (meta) metabolomic data is more feasible than ever before, thus enabling in-depth assessment of community structure, function, and phenotype, thus resulting in a multitude of multi-omic microbiome datasets and the development of innovative methods to integrate and interrogate those multi-omic datasets. Specifically, the application of reference-independent approaches provides opportunities in identifying novel organisms and functions. At present, most of these large-scale multi-omic datasets stem from spatial sampling (e.g., water/soil microbiomes at several depths, microbiomes in/on different parts of the human anatomy) or case-control studies (e.g., cohorts of human microbiomes). We believe that longitudinal multi-omic microbiome datasets are the logical next step in microbiome studies due to their characteristic advantages in providing a better understanding of community dynamics, including: observation of trends, inference of causality, and ultimately, prediction of community behavior. Furthermore, the acquisition of complementary host-derived omics, environmental measurements, and suitable metadata will further enhance the aforementioned advantages of longitudinal data, which will serve as the basis to resolve drivers of community structure and function to understand the biotic and abiotic factors governing communities and specific populations. Carefully setup future experiments hold great potential to further unveil ecological mechanisms to evolution, microbe-microbe interactions, or microbe-host interactions. In this article, we discuss the challenges, emerging strategies, and best-practices applicable to longitudinal microbiome studies ranging from sampling, biomolecular extraction, systematic multi-omic measurements, reference-independent data integration, modeling, and validation.","Martínez Arbas, Susana; Busi, Susheel Bhanu; Queirós, Pedro; de Nies, Laura; Herold, Malte; May, Patrick; Wilmes, Paul; Muller, Emilie E.

Yanghe decoction (YH) is a traditional Chinese herbal formulation which has various anti-inflammatory effects. It has been used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis In this study we aimed to investigate the effects of YH on autoimmune thyroiditis in a rat model and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT) model was established by thyroglobulin (pTG) injections and excessive iodine intake. Thyroid lesions were observed using hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining and serum TgAb, TPOAb, TSH, T3, and T4 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay IL-35 levels were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Th17/Treg balance in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was determined by flow cytometry and RT-PCR. Changes in Wnt/β-catenin signaling were evaluated using Western blot. Immunofluorescence staining and western blot were employed to examine NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the thyroid. YH minimized thyroid follicle injury and decreased concentrations of serum TgAb, TPOAb, TSH, T3, and T4 in EAT model. The mRNA of IL-35 was increased after YH treatment. YH also increased the percentage of Treg cells, and decreased Th17 proportion as well as Th17/Treg ratio in PBMCs. Meanwhile, the mRNA levels of Th17 related cytokines (RORγt, IL-17A, IL-21, and IL-22) were suppressed and Treg related cytokines (FoxP3, TGF-β, and IL-10) were promoted in PBMCs. Additionally, the protein expressions of Wnt-1 and β-catenin were unregulated after YH treatment. NLRP3 immunostaining signal and protein levels of IL-17, p-NF-κB, NLRP3, ASC, cleaved-Caspase-1, cleaved-IL-1β, and IL-18 were downregulated in the thyroid after YH intervention. Overall, the present study demonstrated that YH alleviated autoimmune thyroiditis in rats by improving NLRP3 inflammasome and immune dysregulation.","Ma, Bing’e; Chen, Dexuan; Liu, Yangjing; Zhao, Zhengping; Wang, Jianhua; Zhou, Guowei; Xu, Kun; Zhu, Taiyang; Wang, Qiong; Ma, Chaoqun",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8255388/,583
19885,Digital Medical Device Companion (MyIUS) for New Users of Intrauterine Systems: App Development Study,2021-07-13,"Structural brain changes indicative of dementia occur up to 20 years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Efforts to modify the disease process after the onset of cognitive symptoms have been unsuccessful in recent years. Thus, future trials must begin during the preclinical phases of the disease before symptom onset. Age related cognitive decline is often the result of two coexisting brain pathologies: Alzheimer’s disease (amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration) and vascular disease. This review article highlights some of the common neuroimaging techniques used to visualize the accumulation of neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies during the preclinical stages of dementia such as structural magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and white matter hyperintensities. We also describe some emerging neuroimaging techniques such as arterial spin labeling, diffusion tensor imaging, and quantitative susceptibility mapping. Recent literature suggests that structural imaging may be the most sensitive and cost-effective marker to detect cognitive decline, while molecular positron emission tomography is primarily useful for detecting disease specific pathology later in the disease process. Currently, the presence of vascular disease on magnetic resonance imaging provides a potential target for optimizing vascular risk reduction strategies, and the presence of vascular disease may be useful when combined with molecular and metabolic markers of neurodegeneration for identifying the risk of cognitive impairment.","Schaeffer, Morgan J.; Chan, Leona; Barber, Philip A.",Neural Regen Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8323688/,583

These three measurements provide similar values for the CAC, and there is also evidence from circular dichroism spectroscopy for a possible conformational change in the peptides at the same concentration. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy indicates the formation of micelle-like aggregates above the CAC, which can thus be considered a critical micelle concentration, and the formation of aggregates with a hydrodynamic radius of ∼6–7 nm is also evidenced by dynamic light scattering. We also used synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction to determine the single-crystal structure of captopril and lisinopril. Our results improve the accuracy of previous data reported in the literature, obtained using conventional X-ray sources. We also studied the structure of aqueous solutions containing captopril or lisinopril at high concentrations. The aggregation may be driven by intermolecular interactions between the proline moiety of captopril molecules or between the phenylalanine moiety of lisinopril molecules.","Castelletto, Valeria; Seitsonen, Jani; Ruokolainen, Janne; Barnett, Sarah A.; Sandu, Callum; Hamley, Ian W.",Langmuir,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8397397/,583
21904,Measuring Collaboration Through Concurrent Electronic Health Record Usage: Network Analysis Study,2021-09-03,"The trace element selenium is of essential importance for the synthesis of a set of redox active proteins. We investigated three complementary serum selenium status biomarkers in relation to overall survival and recurrence following diagnosis of primary invasive breast cancer in a large prospective cohort study. The Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network – Breast Initiative (SCAN-B) is a prospective population-based study including multiple participating hospitals. Main analyses included 1996 patients with a new diagnosis of primary invasive breast cancer, with blood sampling at the time of diagnosis. In sera of the patients, total serum selenium, selenoprotein P (SELENOP), and glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) activity was analysed. All three biomarkers showed a positive correlation (p < 0.001), supporting the high quality of samples and analytical techniques. During a total of 13,306 person years of follow-up, 310 deaths and 167 recurrent breast cancer events occurred. In fully adjusted Cox models, all three biomarkers correlated inversely with mortality (p (trend) <0.001) and compared with the lowest quintile, hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for overall survival in the highest quintile of selenium, SELENOP and GPx3 were 0.42 (0.28–0.63), 0.51 (0.36–0.73) and 0.52 (0.36–0.75), respectively. Low GPx3 activity was associated with more recurrences (Q5 vs Q1: fully adjusted HR (95%CI); 0.57 (0.35–0.92), (p (trend) = 0.005). Patients with low selenium status according to all three biomarkers (triple deficient) had the highest mortality risk with an overall survival probability of ∼50% after 8 years, in particular as compared to those having at least one marker in the highest quintile; fully adjusted HR (95%CI); 0.30 (0.21–0.43). Prediction of mortality based on all three biomarkers outperformed established tumour characteristics like histologic grade, number of involved lymph nodes or tumour size.

However, critical care medicine does not seem to have made any major therapeutic progress in the past 30 years. The reduction of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) is due essentially to improvements in both supportive care and the relevant technologies. In future, increases in the number of ICU beds relative to bed numbers in other hospital wards will probably be contemplated, even in a scenario of decreasing costs; clinical protocols will be computerized and/or nurse-driven; more multicenter and international trials will be performed; and organizational strategies will concentrate ICU personnel in a few large units, to promote the flexible management of these healthcare workers. Moreover, extracorporeal organ support technologies will be improved; technology informatics will cover all the bureaucratic aspects of healthcare work, aiding the staff in workload assessment; and critical care multidisciplinary rounds and follow-up services for post-ICU patients will be implemented. Lastly, a better continuum of care between the pre-hospital phase, the emergency care phase, the ICU phase, and the post-ICU phase should be achieved. Also, policies should be drafted to manage sudden large demands for critical care beds in mega-emergencies. The main lines of discussion in critical care nursing research should include nursing research priorities in critical care patients, holistic approaches to the patient, the humanization of care, special populations of ICU patients, and challenges related to critical care nursing during emerging outbreaks of infectious diseases.","Bambi, Stefano",Nursing in Critical Care Setting,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123277/,583

However, existing works rarely address the error (bias) that occurs due to the use of finite samples during the estimation of MI. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing methods address the bias issue for the high-order interaction term which is essential for better approximation of joint MI. In this paper, we first calculate the amount of bias of this term. Moreover, to select features using [Formula: see text] based search, we also show that this term follows [Formula: see text] distribution. Based on these two theoretical results, we propose Discretization and feature Selection based on bias corrected Mutual information (DSbM). DSbM is extended by adding simultaneous forward selection and backward elimination (DSbM[Formula: see text]). We demonstrate the superiority of DSbM over four state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and the number of selected features on twenty benchmark datasets. Experimental results also demonstrate that DSbM outperforms the existing methods in terms of accuracy, Pareto Optimality and Friedman test. We also observe that compared to DSbM, in some dataset DSbM[Formula: see text] selects fewer features and increases accuracy.

43394,Shifts in Older Adults’ Social Support during Early Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-12-16,"In order to achieve the Sustainable Development and Health Goals, it is essential to increase the technological capacity of the most disadvantaged populations. In the 21st century, the necessary technologies for this exist. The gap in technological capacity reflects the existence of a technological gradient between large- and small-scale production, due to an absence of incentives for innovation and a lack of technological dissemination in small businesses and communities. Technological change is central to development, but it is a public good that the market economy does not provide efficiently. Providing it requires the implementation of public policies aimed at technological innovation and dissemination. Reducing the technological gradient is therefore a major part of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Pan American Health Organization’s 2018-2030 Sustainable Health Agenda for the Americas. This also applies to the development of health systems, which function as a redistribution mechanism to break poverty traps. In addition, experiences in these systems are relevant to the implementation of policies that increase technological capacities aimed at reducing poverty, improving social determinants of health, and thereby reducing the scale of the human development trap.","Mayer-Foulkes, David; Serván-Mori, Edson; Nigenda, Gustavo",Rev Panam Salud Publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7737848/,583

First, the chapter constructs two opposed scenarios. The utopian or optimistic scenario is progressive and globalizing in orientation and expects the future to transform corporate sustainability radically to social advantage. The dystopian or pessimistic scenario is conservative and even nationalistic and populist in orientation and expects the future to be chaotic for corporate sustainability to social disadvantage. These designed extremes frame a dialogue. Second, each citizen chooses a political and ethical stance in light of expectations about the future and capacity to influence that future. The analysis details three stances at individual citizens and aggregating political party levels. The greater social division increases the importance of a neutral median voter perspective but increases the likelihood of a centrist party disappearing. A business manager assesses how corporate social responsibility (CSR) views and political criticism of capitalism and wealth affect corporate sustainability.","Windsor, Duane",The Palgrave Handbook of Corporate Sustainability in the Digital Era,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978769/,583

All these viruses are considered to have originated from bats and transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, disease agent of COVID-19, shared around 80% genomic similarity, and thus belong to SARS-related CoVs. As a natural reservoir of viruses, bats harbor numerous other SARS-related CoVs that could potentially infect humans around the world, causing SARS or COVID-19 like outbreaks in the future. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge of CoVs on geographical distribution, genetic diversity, cross-species transmission potential and possible pathogenesis in humans, aiming for a better understanding of bat SARS-related CoVs in the context of prevention and control.","Geng, Rong; Zhou, Peng",Animal Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8062212/,583
52082,Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Children Continues: What Can We Do to Help?,2021-04-26,"INTRODUCTION: The world is experiencing an ongoing and serious pandemic, and as both an anatomy student and anatomy demonstrator, I felt it necessary to comment on the impact this pandemic has had and is having on students’ anatomical education, and on my concerns about the implications it might have on the future of current anatomy students. METHODS: In the form of an extended Letter to the Editor, I present some of my reflections on the above matter and suggest a number of points for anatomy students, demonstrators and institutions to consider as we move forwards. RESULTS: When students lost access to dissection rooms, they lost access not only to cadavers, but also to a range of other optimal learning modalities: prosections, models, pathology specimens, skeletons, and others. Previous authors have highlighted that the modern medical curriculum already restricts students’ exposure to anatomy, and indeed this pandemic has further shortened the contact time current students have received. As a result, current anatomy students are being taught anatomy without access to practical-based learning materials, be that cadavers, prosections, or models. CONCLUSION: Whilst the educational disruption caused by the pandemic is clearly severe, it also presents an opportunity for pedagogical evolution and innovation. Here, I have offered a host of recommendations to those involved in anatomical education. The lasting impacts of the pandemic are still unknown, but the anatomical community has responded creatively and adaptively.","Franchi, Thomas; Franchi, Thomas",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030160/,583

OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility of a behavioral lifestyle intervention, enhanced with mobile health technology for self-monitoring of diet and activity, to improve frailty in overweight/obese older adults (≥65 years) diagnosed with T2D. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Single arm, 6-month study of a behavioral lifestyle intervention in 20 overweight/obese (BMI>25) older adults (≥ 65 years) with self-reported T2D diagnosis who owned a smartphone. A Fitbit tracker was provided to all participants for self-monitoring of diet and physical activity. Our primary outcome of feasibility was measured by session attendance, adherence to Fitbit usage to self-monitor diet and physical activity, and study retention. Secondary outcomes included the preliminary efficacy of the intervention on frailty, physical function, quality of life, and T2D-related outcomes. RESULTS: Eighteen participants completed the study. The mean age was 71.5 (SD ± 5.3) years, 56% were female, and half were Hispanic. At baseline, 13 (72%) were pre-frail, 4 (22%) were frail, and 1 (6%) were non-frail. At follow-up, frailty scores improved significantly from 1.61 ± 1.15 to 0.94 ± 0.94 (p=0.01) and bodyweight improved from 205.66 ± 45.52 lbs. to 198.33 ± 43.6 lbs. (p=<0.001). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for the feasibility of a behavioral lifestyle intervention in overweight/obese older adults with T2D and preliminary results support its potential efficacy in improving frailty score.","Jiwani, Rozmin; Wang, J.; Li, C.; Dennis, B.; Patel, D.; Gelfond, J.; Liu, Q.; Siddiqui, N.; Bess, C.; Monk, S.; Serra, M.; Espinoza, S.",J Frailty Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8068458/,583
53146,The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Women’s Reproductive Health,2021-05-03,"The global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in learning and teaching being confronted with immense challenges and changes since spring 2020. Measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic had and continue to have a particularly strong impact on non-formal and informal learning, which are important features of out-of-class on-line STEM workshops combining science, technology, engineering and mathematics. We developed and carried out online STEM workshops for approximately 250 students during times of isolation in the spring and summer of 2020. To identify potential success factors and stumbling blocks for designing and implementing online STEM workshops, we conducted a qualitative interview-based study with a selection of eight experts in the summer and autumn 2020, i.e. after the STEM workshops. The experts were Austrian and German teachers who planned and implemented STEM workshops for students age 10 to 18. Our collected data was examined using techniques of grounded theory approaches. Using techniques of qualitative interview studies and grounded theory approaches, we found that removing learning barriers and creating new types of learning spaces, online socio-constructivist learning, and teachers' TPACK for STEM Workshops are important factors when considering and designing STEM workshops for online learning environments. These same factors will also be central when planning and implementing online STEM workshops in post-COVID-19 times. To facilitate student participation and to increase social interaction are critical elements for practitioners working on online STEM workshops—both during and after COVID-19. Highly trained teachers with in-depth technical, pedagogical, and content skills are essential to facilitate participation and interactions among students, teachers, and learning contents.","Weinhandl, Robert; Thrainer, Susanne; Lavicza, Zsolt; Houghton, Tony; Hohenwarter, Markus",SN Soc Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8129695/,583

Hence, student health and safety, discrimination, and the services by the International Student Office (ISO) have remained unexplored. Moreover, due to the motivational differences between the students from developing and developed regions, a study that samples students from both regions may depict an exact picture of the experience of international students. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the influence of the dimensions (including those dimensions that have been ignored) of the experience of international students on their satisfaction. In addition, we make recommendations regarding Chinese institutes for future students based on a comparison between the students from developing and developed regions. Using hierarchical regression analysis, this study reveals that educational and non-educational experiences vary among students from different regions. Therefore, based on developing (e.g., Asia and Africa) and developed (e.g., America, Europe, and Australia) regions, important recommendations are discussed regarding how educational institutions and the Chinese government could best allocate resources and introduce policies to improve the experience of international students.","Qadeer, Talat; Javed, Muhammad Kashif; Manzoor, Aqsa; Wu, Min; Zaman, Syed Imran",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8415018/,583

This trial compares the clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness of TEM and EMR for large rectal adenomas. DESIGN Patients with rectal adenomas ≥3 cm, without malignant features, were randomised (1:1) to EMR or TEM, allowing endoscopic removal of residual adenoma at 3 months. Unexpected malignancies were excluded postrandomisation. Primary outcomes were recurrence within 24 months (aiming to demonstrate non-inferiority of EMR, upper limit 10%) and the number of recurrence-free days alive and out of hospital. RESULTS Two hundred and four patients were treated in 18 university and community hospitals. Twenty-seven (13%) had unexpected cancer and were excluded from further analysis. Overall recurrence rates were 15% after EMR and 11% after TEM; statistical non-inferiority was not reached. The numbers of recurrence-free days alive and out of hospital were similar (EMR 609±209, TEM 652±188, p=0.16). Complications occurred in 18% (EMR) versus 26% (TEM) (p=0.23), with major complications occurring in 1% (EMR) versus 8% (TEM) (p=0.064). Quality-adjusted life years were equal in both groups. EMR was approximately €3000 cheaper and therefore more cost-effective. CONCLUSION Under the statistical assumptions of this study, non-inferiority of EMR could not be demonstrated. However, EMR may have potential as the primary method of choice due to a tendency of lower complication rates and a better cost-effectiveness ratio. The high rate of unexpected cancers should be dealt with in further studies.","Barendse, Renée M; Musters, Gijsbert D; de Graaf, Eelco J R; van den Broek, Frank J C; Consten, Esther C J; Doornebosch, Pascal G; Hardwick, James C; de Hingh, Ignace H J T; Hoff, Chrisiaan; Jansen, Jeroen M; van Milligen de Wit, A W Marc; van der Schelling, George P; Schoon, Erik J; Schwartz, Matthijs P; Weusten, Bas L A M; Dijkgraaf, Marcel G; Fockens, Paul; Bemelman, Willem A; Dekker, Evelien",Gut,https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2016-313101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28659349/,583
61949,A systematic review of the behaviour change techniques and digital features in technology-driven type 2 diabetes prevention interventions.,2020,"UNLABELLED Several arenaviruses are known to cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in sub-Saharan Africa and South America, where VHF is a major public health and medical concern. The biosafety level 4 categorization of these arenaviruses restricts their use and has impeded biological studies, including therapeutic drug and/or vaccine development. Due to difficulties associated with handling live viruses, pseudotype viruses, which transiently bear arenavirus envelope proteins based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or retrovirus, have been developed as surrogate virus systems. Here, we report the development of a pseudotype VSV bearing each envelope protein of various species of arenaviruses (AREpv), including the newly identified Lujo virus (LUJV) and Chapare virus. Pseudotype arenaviruses generated in 293T cells exhibited high infectivity in various mammalian cell lines. The infections by New World and Old World AREpv were dependent on their receptors (human transferrin receptor 1 [hTfR1] and α-dystroglycan [αDG], respectively). However, infection by pseudotype VSV bearing the LUJV envelope protein (LUJpv) occurred independently of hTfR1 and αDG, indicating that LUJpv utilizes an unidentified receptor. The pH-dependent endocytosis of AREpv was confirmed by the use of lysosomotropic agents. The fusion of cells expressing these envelope proteins, except for those expressing the LUJV envelope protein, was induced by transient treatment at low pH values. LUJpv infectivity was inhibited by U18666A, a cholesterol transport inhibitor. Furthermore, the infectivity of LUJpv was significantly decreased in the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-deficient cell line, suggesting the necessity for NPC1 activity for efficient LUJpv infection. IMPORTANCE LUJV is a newly identified arenavirus associated with a VHF outbreak in southern Africa. Although cell entry for many arenaviruses has been studied, cell entry for LUJV has not been characterized. In this study, we found that LUJpv utilizes neither αDG nor hTfR1 as a receptor and found unique characteristics of LUJV glycoprotein in membrane fusion and cell entry. Proper exclusion of cholesterol or some kinds of lipids may play important roles in LUJpv cell entry.","Tani, Hideki; Iha, Koichiro; Shimojima, Masayuki; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Taniguchi, Satoshi; Yoshikawa, Tomoki; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Nakasone, Naoe; Ninomiya, Haruaki; Saijo, Masayuki; Morikawa, Shigeru",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00512-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741091/,583

At present, various devices are available for pre-coagulation transection (PCT) of hepatic parenchyma with the intent of minimizing procedure-associated postoperative haemorrhage and bile leak. This report presents the evaluation of a novel bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energy device for PCT used for laparoscopic hepatic resection. METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic hepatic resection using the Enseal device (SurgRx Inc.) were identified from the prospectively maintained hepatobiliary database. Information on patient demographics, procedures and postoperative complications was collected and analysed; complications were grouped into early (at <30 days) and late (at > or = 30 days) events. RESULTS A total of 18 patients, of whom 13 had malignant tumours (12 colorectal metastases and one hepatocellular carcinoma) and five had benign tumours (two hepatic adenomas and three haemangiomas) underwent 18 hepatic procedures, including two formal hemi-hepatectomies, four left lateral sections, three posterior sections and nine atypical non-anatomic resections. Estimated blood loss did not differ from institutional historical control data; no postoperative haemorrhage, bile leaks or hepatic abscess or necrosis were identified (n = 18).

It is not only the complexity that limits such a procedure but also its rare indication. The following article demonstrates the technical aspects of laparoscopic pylorus- and spleen-preserving duodenopancreatectomy. CASE REPORT The indication for intervention in the underlying case was a patient diagnosed with a multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I syndrome and a multifocal neuroendocrine tumor (NET) infiltrating the duodenum and the pancreas. The patient was post median laparotomy which was necessary after jejunal perforation due to a peptic ulcer. The resection was carried out entirely laparoscopically, and the reconstruction, which included a biliodigestive anastomosis and a gastroenterostomy, was carried out by means of a median upper abdomen laparotomy of 7 cm in length through which the resected specimen was also removed. The total operative time was 391 min. The blood loss accounted for 250 ml. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the eighth postoperative day. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic pancreatectomy is a treatment option in carefully selected indications. The complexity of the operation demands a high level of expertise in the surgical team.","Schlöricke, Erik; Hoffmann, Martin; Kujath, Peter; Shetty, Ganesh M; Scheer, Fabian; Liedke, Marc O; Zimmermann, Markus",Viszeralmedizin,https://doi.org/10.1159/000439335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26989393/,583

However, access to services and hence chances for survival and preserving the eye and its vision vary widely across the globe. Some families have to, or make a choice to, leave their home country to seek planned medical treatment abroad. We aimed to investigate how frequently this cross border travel occurs and the factors associated with it. A total of 278 Rb centers in 153 countries were recruited to participate in a global cross-sectional analysis of newly diagnosed Rb patients in 2017. Number and proportions of children who travelled from their home country for treatment were analysed by country, continent, socio-economic stratum, and clinical and demographic features. The cohort included 4,351 new patients of whom 223 (5.1%, 95% CI 4.5-5.8) were taken across country borders for planned medical treatment. Independently significant predictors of travelling across borders included: being from a country with a smaller population, being from a country classified as low socioeconomic status, having bilateral Rb, and having intra-ocular disease without extra-ocular spread. The factors that determine international travel for retinoblastoma treatment are complex and deserve further investigation. We may need to rethink the way services are delivered in the light of the threat of severe curtailment of international travel from pandemics like COVID-19.","Bowman, Rjc; Foster, A; Stacey, A; Keren-Froim, N; Bascaran, C; Kivelä, T T; Munier, F; Fabian, I D",International journal of cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.33350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070355/,583

There are many reports for various laparoscopic procedures of EJ using linear or circular staplers. On the other hands, there has been no report for hand-sewn anastomosis. We report successfully performed intracorporeally hand-sewn EJ after LTG. MATERIALS AND METHODS The clinicopathologic data and short-term surgical outcomes of 6 patients who underwent totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy for upper gastric cancer from December 2010 and July 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS The mean age was 66.5 years and mean body mass index (kg/m(2)) was 24.6. All patients had medical comorbidities. The mean patient ASA score was 2.17. Among the 6 patients, previous abdominal operation was performed for 2 patients and combined operation was performed for 3 patients. The mean blood loss, operation time, and EJ anastomosis time was 130 ml, 379.7 minutes, and 81.5 minutes, respectively. The mean time to first flatus, first oral intake, and postoperative hospital stay was 3.0, 3.0, and 12.5 days, respectively. There was no 30-day mortality case.

64851,"The quality of life, resources, and coping during the first weeks of the COVID‑19 pandemic in people seeking psychological counselling before the pandemic.",2021-04-21,"BACKGROUND There is debate in the literature whether cam morphology is associated with increased risk for hip osteoarthritis. The capability of femoroplasty to alter the natural history of cam morphology is still in question. PURPOSE To (1) investigate the correlation between cam morphology and damage to the articular cartilage and (2) assess whether correction of the cam morphology affects survivorship of the joint, progression to arthroplasty, and functional patient-reported outcome scores. STUDY DESIGN Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS Data were prospectively collected for patients presenting for hip arthroscopy between February 2008 and April 2017. Cases were divided into 3 groups: control group with an alpha angle <50° pre- and postoperatively, treated group with an alpha angle >55° preoperatively and <50° postoperatively, and a group with an alpha angle >55° pre- and postoperatively. All patients had minimum 2-year postoperative follow-up for the modified Harris Hip Score, the Non-arthritic Hip Score, and visual analog scale for pain. Conversion to total hip arthroplasty was recorded. RESULTS A 1:1:1 match successfully yielded 98 hips for each group. Follow-up time was 50.77 ± 24.60 months (mean ± SD). The pre- and postoperative mean alpha angles were 45.2°± 3.4° and 40.6°± 4.3° in the control group, respectively; 66.2°± 8.4° and 42.3°± 5.9° in the treated group; and 68.5°± 9.4° and 61.4°± 7.6° in the alpha >55° group. Intraoperatively, the alpha >55° and treated groups had greater acetabular cartilage damage than the control group (P = .0245 and P = .0036, acetabular labrum articular disruption, respectively; P = .0347 and P = .0211, acetabular Outerbridge). The alpha >55° group achieved the patient acceptable symptomatic state for the modified Harris Hip Score (58.2%) significantly less than the treated (75.5%; P = .0100) and control (73.5%; P = .0239) groups. Progression to arthroplasty was significantly higher in the alpha >55° group (n = 17) when compared with the control (n = 8) and treated (n = 10) groups (P = .0034 and P = .0338, respectively). CONCLUSION Cam deformity was associated with higher-grade damage of the acetabular articular cartilage. An alpha angle >55° after surgery was associated with lower native hip joint survivability and less successful functional outcomes when compared with that of treated cam deformity as well as no deformity. These data suggest that correcting the cam deformity may positively affect the natural history of these patients.","Domb, Benjamin G; Annin, Shawn; Chen, Jeffrey W; Kyin, Cynthia; Rosinsky, Philip J; Maldonado, David R; Meghpara, Mitchell B; Lall, Ajay C; Shapira, Jacob",The American journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546520949541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32900209/,583

Many cyanobacteria taxa may produce microcystins, a group of toxic cyclic heptapeptides. Understanding the relationships between the abiotic drivers of microcystins and their occurrence would assist in the implementation of targeted, cost-effective solutions to maintain safe drinking and recreational waters. Cyanobacteria and microcystins were measured by flow cytometry and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in two interconnected reservoirs varying in age and management regimes, in southern Britain over a 12-month period. Microcystins were detected in both reservoirs, with significantly higher concentrations in the southern lake (maximum concentration >7 µg L-1). Elevated microcystin concentrations were not positively correlated with numbers of cyanobacterial cells, but multiple linear regression analysis suggested temperature and dissolved oxygen explained a significant amount of the variability in microcystin across both reservoirs. The presence of a managed fishery in one lake was associated with decreased microcystin levels, suggestive of top down control on cyanobacterial populations. This study supports the need to develop inclusive, multifactor holistic water management strategies to control cyanobacterial risks in freshwater bodies.","Hartnell, David M; Chapman, Ian J; Taylor, Nick G H; Esteban, Genoveva F; Turner, Andrew D; Franklin, Daniel J",Toxins,https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins12080503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764428/,583
66575,Inequalities persist in Europe-and COVID-19 does not help.,2021-04-13,"Numerous healthcare professionals fighting COVID-19 worldwide are suffering from the protective respirators related facial pressure injuries. This study explored the mechanism and prevention of such injuries, and devised a novel emergent strategy, which was supported by a multicenter self-controlled study in 1161 frontline healthcare professionals. In this study, according to the anatomy of the face and the characteristics of facial pressure injuries, a respirator liner was designed using a polyurethane foam to redistribute the pressure across the face. A pre-clinical crossover trial was performed on eight participants to evaluate its efficacy. The strategy was then widely applied among 11 100 healthcare workers in seven frontline hospitals, and 1161 of them were sampled for a questionnaire investigation. The pre-clinical crossover trial showed that the novel strategy was very effective in preventing facial pressure injuries. The questionnaire investigation showed that pain score, wearing disturbance, and the incidence of pressure injury in the healthcare professionals were significantly correlated with wearing time (all ρ = 0.986). The new strategy significantly reduced the incidence of pressure injury from 84.7% to 11.1%, pain score IQR from 5 (2) to 1 (2), and wearing disturbance rate from 91.6% to 6.3%, and the results analyzed according to individual hospitals or different wearing time showed similar trends (all P < 0.0005). The protective respirators related facial pressure injuries can be effectively mitigated with this emergent strategy, which has also been applied in some European hospitals and can be popularized to help more healthcare professionals who are combating COVID-19 on the frontlines.

A better understanding is required on how operation affects product selectivity. This study demonstrated that the hydraulic retention time (HRT) and organic loading rate (OLR) selected fermentation pathways in a single-stage, semi-continuous stirred tank reactor. Three combinations of HRT and OLR were tested to distinguish the effect of each parameter. Three fermentation profiles with distinct microbial communities were obtained. Predominantly n-butyric acid (13 ± 2 gCOD L-1, 55 ± 14% of carboxylates) was produced at an HRT of 8.5 days and OLR around 12 gCOD L-1d-1. Operating at an HRT two days longer, yet with similar OLR, stimulated chain elongation (up to 13.6 gCOD L-1 of n-caproic acid). This was reflected by a microbial community twice as diverse at longer HRT as indicated by first and second order Hill number (1D = 24 ± 4, 2D = 12 ± 3) and by a higher relative abundance of genera related to secondary fermentation, such as the VFA-elongating Caproiciproducens spp., and secondary lactic acid fermenter Secundilactobacillus spp.. Operating at a higher OLR (20 gCOD L-1d-1) but HRT of 8.5 days, resulted in typical lactic acid fermentation (34 ± 5 gCOD L-1) harbouring a less diverse community (1D = 8.0 ± 0.7, 2D = 5.7 ± 0.9) rich in acid-resistant homofermentative Lactobacillus spp. These findings demonstrate that a flexible product portfolio can be achieved by small adjustments in two key operating conditions.

This paper presents the findings of a social work led peer support model, COVID-19 Am I Resilient (cAIR), developed and deployed during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: This quality improvement initiative was developed and piloted within the Clinical Education and Practice department at a large urban health care system. The pilot included provision of peer support through synchronous video presentations, one-on-one peer support, and resourcing and referral. Pilot outcomes of feasibility and staff engagement were evaluated using participant responses to an online survey as well as attendance records at project activities.Implications: Developed to help frontline health care workers thrive in the midst, and wake, of the COVID-19 pandemic, the pilot study of the cAIR peer support model has implications for further development and implementation of peer support for typically underrepresented health care disciplines working during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future public health emergencies.","Rubin, Elizabeth Wierman; Rassman, Anna",Social work in health care,https://doi.org/10.1080/00981389.2021.1904321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33761837/,583

72296,"Animal health professionals' knowledge,risk perceptions and preventive practices towards zoonotic infections in Nigeria: any challenging gap?",2019,"Background Inappropriate antibiotic therapy is accelerating the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are predominantly caused by viruses, resulting in the prescription of antibiotics to a few selected patients. Previous studies in primary health care centers (PHCCs) in Indonesia have shown a high percentage of antibiotic therapy for URTIs. This study tries to analyze the difference in profiles of antibiotic prescription in the treatment of children and adults with URTI in Bangka Tengah, Indonesia. Methods Random prescriptions from patients diagnosed with URTIs (sinusitis, bronchitis, common cold, and pharyngitis) from all PHCCs in Bangka Tengah were collected from January to February 2018. Prescriptions from patients with overlapping diagnoses, such as URTI with diarrhea or typhoid, were excluded. Results During the two months of data collection, 1348 prescriptions for adults and children with URTIs were studied. Children were 1.30 (95% CI, 1.03-1.58) times more likely to be treated with antibiotics compared to adults. Amoxicillin was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic both in children (92.3%) and adults (78.6%). Ciprofloxacin was commonly prescribed in adults (14.6%) but not in children (0.3%). Conclusions This study confirms the major antibiotic overuse in patients with URTI, especially in children. Owing to the fact that children are more likely to get URTI of viral origin, they receive high percentage of antibiotic therapy. These findings support the need for collaborated intervention to decrease unnecessary prescription of antibiotics in Bangka Tengah.","Novan Y I, Pratama; Primadi, Avianto",Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1515/jbcpp-2019-0248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31926085/,583

Rurality is an important determinant of health that may influence receipt of evidence-based alcohol-related care. In a large, national sample of Veterans Health Administration (VA) patients with AUD with documented and non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity, we examine whether meeting national Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures for specialty addictions care and receiving evidence-based medications for AUD differs across patients living in urban, large rural, and small rural areas. Methods: VA electronic health record data were used to identify all patients with AUD documented in Fiscal Year 2012. Rurality was measured using a three-category rural and urban commuting area (RUCA) classification linked to patient zip code. Logistic regression models with clustered standard errors-iteratively adjusted for hypothesized confounders-were used to estimate the likelihood and marginal probabilities of receiving care for patients living in small and large rural areas, relative to urban areas. Primary outcomes included HEDIS initiation (any visit within 14 days of initial AUD visit after a 60-day period of no treatment), HEDIS engagement (2 or more AUD visits within 30 days of HEDIS initiation visit) and having any filled prescription for AUD medications (naltrexone, disulfiram, acamprosate, or topiramate). Results: For all outcomes, patients living in large and small rural areas had a lower likelihood of receiving evidence-based AUD treatment than patients living in urban areas (all p-values < 0.05); differences in marginal probabilities across groups were relatively small. Conclusions: In this national sample of VA patients with AUD, those living in more rural areas were less likely to receive evidence-based treatment for AUD than those living in urban areas. Further research is needed to investigate strategies to increase receipt of specialty care and pharmacotherapy in more rural areas.","Edmonds, Amy T; Bensley, Kara M; Hawkins, Eric J; Williams, Emily C",Substance abuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2020.1803176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32821028/,583

SUMMARY The intake of total and individual n-3 and n-6 PUFAs in European infants, children, adolescents, elderly and pregnant/lactating women was evaluated systematically. RESULTS The evaluations were done against recommendations of the European Food Safety Authority. Key Messages: Fifty-three studies from 17 different European countries reported an intake of total n-3 and n-6 PUFAs and/or individual n-3 or n-6 PUFAs in at least one of the specific population groups: 10 in pregnant women, 4 in lactating women, 3 in infants 6-12 months, 6 in children 1-3 years, 11 in children 4-9 years, 8 in adolescents 10-18 years and 11 in elderly >65 years. Mean linoleic acid intake was within the recommendation (4 energy percentage [E%]) in 52% of the countries, with inadequate intakes more likely in lactating women, adolescents and elderly. Mean α-linolenic acid intake was within the recommendation (0.5 E%) in 77% of the countries. In 26% of the countries, mean eicosapentaenoic acid and/or docosahexaenoic acid intake was as recommended.

In this study, we compared the performance of surgical novices using instruments with and without articulating shafts to perform a simulated TES task. METHODS Medical students each performed 10 repetitions of the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery circle-cut task. Participants were randomized into 3 groups: 2 performed the task through a TES proctoscope using scissors with either a rigid (TES-R) or articulating (TES-A) shaft. The third group performed the task laparoscopically (LAP). RESULTS A total of 31 medical students participated. The LAP group had a faster mean task time than both the TES-R and TES-A groups (LAP 201±120 s vs. TES-R 362±212 s and TES-A 405±212 s, both P <0.001). The TES-R group made more errors (ie, deviation from a perfect circle) than both the other groups. The TES-R group adjusted the proctoscope position during more repetitions than the TES-A group. CONCLUSIONS Students had faster task times when operating laparoscopically than through a TES protoscope. Task times were similar between the TES groups using scissors with articulating and rigid shafts; however, use of the articulating instruments resulted in fewer errors and less need to adjust proctoscope position.","Teitelbaum, Ezra N; Arafat, Fahd O; Boller, Anne-Marie","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27380616/,583

78331,How Residents Learn During Emergent Situations May Be Different Than How We Were Taught.,2020-10-01,"We recently reported results that erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA)-related thrombotic toxicities in preclinical species were not solely dependent on a high hematocrit (HCT) but also associated with increased ESA dose level, dose frequency, and dosing duration. In this article, we conclude that sequelae of an increased magnitude of ESA-stimulated erythropoiesis potentially contributed to thrombosis in the highest ESA dose groups. The results were obtained from two investigative studies we conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats administered a low (no thrombotic toxicities) or high (with thrombotic toxicities) dose level of a hyperglycosylated analog of recombinant human erythropoietin (AMG 114), 3 times weekly for up to 9 days or for 1 month. Despite similarly increased HCT at both dose levels, animals in the high-dose group had an increased magnitude of erythropoiesis measured by spleen weights, splenic erythropoiesis, and circulating reticulocytes. Resulting prothrombotic risk factors identified predominantly or uniquely in the high-dose group were higher numbers of immature reticulocytes and nucleated red blood cells in circulation, severe functional iron deficiency, and increased intravascular destruction of iron-deficient reticulocyte/red blood cells. No thrombotic events were detected in rats dosed up to 9 days suggesting a sustained high HCT is a requisite cofactor for development of ESA-related thrombotic toxicities.","Andrews, Dina A; Boren, Babette M; Turk, James R; Boyce, Rogely W; He, Yudong D; Hamadeh, Hisham K; Mytych, Daniel T; Barger, Troy E; Salimi-Moosavi, Hossein; Sloey, Bethlyn; Elliott, Steve; McElroy, Patricia; Sinclair, Angus M; Shimamoto, Grant; Pyrah, Ian T G; Lightfoot-Dunn, Ruth M",Toxicologic pathology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0192623313486319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23674391/,583

METHODS This prospective two-center study investigated early progression of CAV by coronary optical coherence tomography in 1 month and 12 months after heart transplantation (HTx) in 104 patients. Detection and characterization of donor specific (DSA) and MHC class-I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) antibodies were performed before, 1, 6 and 12 months after transplantation. RESULTS During the first post-HTx year, we observed a significant reduction in the mean coronary luminal area (P < .001), and progression in mean intimal thickness (IT) (P < .001). DSA and anti-MICA occurred in 17% of all patients, but no significant relationship was observed between presence of DSA/anti-MICA and IT progression within 12 months after HTx. In contrast, we observed significant association between presence of DSA (p=0.031), de-novo DSA (p=0.031), HLA Class II DSA (p=0.017) and media thickness (MT) progression. CONCLUSION Results of our study did not identify a direct association between presence of DSA/anti-MICA and intimal thickness progression in an early period after HTx.

79109,Perceived uncertainty stress and its predictors among residents in China during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-02-11,"Decisions under threat are crucial to survival and require integration of distinct situational features such as threat probability and magnitude. Recent evidence from human lesion and neuroimaging studies implicated anterior hippocampus (aHC) and amygdala in approach/avoidance decisions under threat, and linked their integrity to cautious behavior. Here we sought to elucidate how threat dimensions and behavior are represented in these structures.Twenty human participants (11 female) completed an approach-avoidance conflict task during high-resolution functional MRI. Participants could gather tokens under threat of capture by a virtual predator, which would lead to token loss. Threat probability (predator wake-up rate) and magnitude (amount of token loss) varied on each trial. To disentangle effects of threat features, and ensuing behavior, we performed a multifold parametric analysis.We found that high threat probability and magnitude related to BOLD signal in left anterior hippocampus/entorhinal cortex. However BOLD signal in this region was better explained by avoidance behavior than by these threat features. A priori region-of-interest analysis confirmed the relation of anterior hippocampus BOLD response with avoidance. Exploratory subfield analysis revealed that this relation was specific to anterior CA2/3 but not CA1. Left lateral amygdala responded to low and high, but not intermediate threat probability.Our results suggest that anterior hippocampus BOLD signal is better explained by avoidance behavior than by threat features in approach-avoidance conflict. Rather than representing threat features in a monotonic manner, it appears that anterior hippocampus may compute approach/avoidance decisions based on integration of situational threat features represented in other neural structures.Significance statementAn effective threat anticipation system is crucial to survival across species. Natural threats, however, are diverse and have distinct features. To be able to adapt to different modes of danger, the brain needs to recognize these features, integrate them and use them to modify behavior. Our results disclose the human anterior hippocampus as a likely arbiter of approach/avoidance decisions harnessing compound environmental information while partially replicating previous findings and blending into recent efforts to illuminate the neural basis of approach-avoidance conflict in humans.","Abivardi, Aslan; Khemka, Saurabh; Bach, Dominik R",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2732-19.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719163/,583

Methods A systematic approach was used to retrieve and extract relevant data. A total of 5163 citations were identified, of which seven unique studies met criteria for inclusion; one was a randomized controlled trial, two were prospective cohort studies, and four were qualitative studies. The following social media platforms were evaluated: discussion forums (6 studies) and collaborative project (1 study). Results The available evidence suggests that health professionals perceived discussion forums and collaborative projects to be useful social media platforms to facilitate chronic disease self-management with patients. No relevant evidence was found regarding the use of other social media platforms. Most studies indicated positive findings regarding health professionals' intention to use discussion forums, while the one study that used a collaborative project also indicated positive findings with its perceived ease of use as health professionals felt that it was useful to facilitate chronic disease self-management with patients. Mixed findings were seen in regards to health professionals' perceived ease of use of discussion forums. The most common barrier to using social media platforms was the lack of time in health professionals' schedules. Conclusions Discussion forums and collaborative projects appear to be promising resources for health professionals to assist their patients in self-managing their chronic conditions; however, further research comparing various social media platforms is needed.","De Angelis, Gino; Wells, George A; Davies, Barbara; King, Judy; Shallwani, Shirin M; McEwan, Jessica; Cavallo, Sabrina; Brosseau, Lucie",Digital health,https://doi.org/10.1177/2055207618771416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29942633/,583
79458,The COVID-19 experiment: Pandemic planning and preparedness lessons we must remember.,2020,"Introduction Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of hair follicles which usually affects patients' quality of life negatively. Although there are various therapeutic approaches including topical and systemic antibiotics, retinoids, biological agents, and also surgical modalities, there is no curative treatment option and clinical management of HS is still challenging. Case Presentation Herein, we present a 43 year-old man with HS who had used different treatments in 15 years. The patient showed improvement initially with adalimumab, then exhibited secondary unresponsiveness after 18 months. While worsening of HS was recorded due to increased discharge under secukinumab, no additional benefit was observed with methotrexate. He was not willing to undergo surgical procedures due to previous surgical experience. Finally, certolizumab pegol has been started to patient with similar dosing to psoriasis patients. Sartorius, 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS), and dermatological life quality index (DLQI) scores regressed from 171 to 105, 9/10 to 3/10, and 27 to 19 after 3 months with certolizumab pegol treatment. Discussion/Conclusion Certolizumab pegol is a humanized antigen-binding fragment of a monoclonal antibody which binds to TNF-alpha. However, certolizumab pegol is only approved for plaque psoriasis in dermatology; it is likely to be a promising effective agent for HS, especially in challenging cases.","Esme, Pelin; Akoglu, Gulsen; Caliskan, Ercan",Skin appendage disorders,https://doi.org/10.1159/000511284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614722/,583
81199,Re-thinking Physical Activity Promotion during COVID-19 Pandemic: Focus on a 24-hour Day.,2021-02-15,"BACKGROUND RAS mutations are the only validated biomarkers in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy. Limited clinical information is available on AXL expression, marker of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, in mCRC. METHODS AXL was retrospectively assessed by immunohistochemistry in 307 patients. RAS wild-type (WT) patients (N = 136) received first-line anti-EGFR-based therapy; RAS mutant patients (N = 171) received anti-angiogenic-based regimens. Preclinical experiments were performed using human RAS WT CRC cell lines and xenograft models. AXL RNA levels were assessed in a cohort of patients with available samples at baseline and at progression to anti-EGFR treatment and in the GSE5851 dataset. RESULTS AXL was expressed in 55/307 tumour tissues, correlating with worse survival in the overall population (AXL-positive, 23.7 months; AXL-negative, 30.8 months; HR, 1.455, P = 0.032) and in RAS WT patients (AXL-positive, 23.0 months; AXL-negative, 35.8 months; HR,1.780, P = 0.032). Progression-free survival (PFS) in the RAS WT cohort was shorter in the AXL-positive cohort (6.2 months versus 12.1 months; HR, 1.796, P = 0.013). Three-dimensional cultures obtained from a patient following anti-EGFR therapy resulted AXL-positive, showing resistance to anti-EGFR drugs and sensitivity to AXL inhibition. AXL transfection in CRC cell lines induced AXL overexpression and resistance to the EGFR blockade. At progression to cetuximab, 2/10 SW48-tumour xenograft mice showed AXL expression. Consistently, AXL RNA levels increased in 5/7 patients following anti-EGFR therapy. Moreover, in the GSE5851 dataset higher AXL RNA levels correlated with worse PFS with cetuximab in KRAS-exon2 WT chemorefractory patients. CONCLUSIONS AXL is a marker of poor prognosis in mCRC with consistent clinical and preclinical evidences of involvement in primary and acquired resistance to anti-EGFR drugs in RAS WT patients.","Cardone, Claudia; Blauensteiner, Bernadette; Moreno-Viedma, Veronica; Martini, Giulia; Simeon, Vittorio; Vitiello, Pietro P; Ciardiello, Davide; Belli, Valentina; Matrone, Nunzia; Troiani, Teresa; Morgillo, Floriana; Zito Marino, Federica; Dentice, Monica; Nappi, Annarita; Boccaccino, Alessandra; Antoniotti, Carlotta; Cremolini, Chiara; Pietrantonio, Filippo; Prager, Gerald W; Normanno, Nicola; Maiello, Evaristo; Argiles, Guillem; Elez, Elena; Signoriello, Giuseppe; Franco, Renato; Falcone, Alfredo; Tabernero, Josep; Sibilia, Maria; Ciardiello, Fortunato; Martinelli, Erika",European journal of cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.07.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818762/,583

After an exhaustive search from Scopus and Web of Science, 40 studies matching our criteria are included in the review. We qualitatively summarize the literature country-wise and use text map of co-occurring terms in the titles, keywords, and abstracts of these articles to determine the similarities and differences among sub-themes in continental clusters. Research done in Asian, European, North American, and multi-cultural studies suggests that attributes unique to each culture are instrumental in shaping public attitudes towards euthanasia. We also find that some cultures, despite the prevalence of euthanasia, are underrepresented in empirical research. This review of literature on the cultural nuances in end-of-life decisions such as euthanasia is pertinent to social scientists, healthcare professionals and social workers in any given time, but more so during such critical events as worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.","Karumathil, Anjana A; Tripathi, Ritu",Omega,https://doi.org/10.1177/0030222820984655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33377420/,583

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate how health care providers may improve psoriasis patients' adherence to topical treatment. Materials and methods: A systematic literature search was performed for English-language articles in Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, Cinahl, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. Results: Ten studies of varying quality were identified. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing the adherence-improving potential of interventions by health care providers to support patients showed improvement in adherence to topical treatment. In a prospective study with a pre/postdesign, an individualized, face-to-face consultation reported an improvement in patient-reported adherence to topical treatment over a 9-week period. Based on seven qualitative studies obtaining insights from either patients or health care providers, health care providers may need to address socio-economic factors, health care system factors, and treatment-, patient-, and disease-related factors in interventions that aim to improve the adherence of psoriasis patients to topical antipsoriatic drugs. Conclusion: There is a need to develop better adherence-improving interventions. A good patient-health care provider relationship is considered crucial to adherence and may be an important intervention target. Before interventions to improve adherence to topicals can be recommended for the clinic, the intervention should be tested in high-quality RCTs.","Svendsen, Mathias Tiedemann; Feldmann, Steven; Tiedemann, Sylvia Naiga; Sørensen, Anne Sofie Stochholm; Rivas, Cecilie Marie Ringgaard; Andersen, Klaus Ejner",The Journal of dermatological treatment,https://doi.org/10.1080/09546634.2019.1623371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122090/,583

The resulting average structure is described in space group P\overline 1, Z = 1 with the molecule on the inversion centre. The molecules are arranged in chains. The molecules, which have no inversion symmetry, show orientational head-to-tail disorder. In the average structure, the methyl group is disordered and found on both ends of the molecule with an occupancy of 0.5 each. The disorder and the local structure were investigated using various ordered structural models. All models were analysed by three approaches: Rietveld refinement, structure refinement to the pair distribution function (PDF) and lattice-energy minimization. All refinements converged well. The Rietveld refinement provided the average structure and gave no indication of a long-range ordering. The refinement to the PDF turned out to be very sensitive to small structural details, giving insight into the local structure. The lattice-energy minimizations revealed a significantly preferred local ordering of neighbouring molecules along the [0\bar 11] direction. In conclusion, all methods indicate a statistical orientational disorder with a preferred parallel orientation of molecules in one direction. Additionally, electron diffraction revealed twinning and faint diffuse scattering.","Schlesinger, Carina; Hammer, Sonja M; Gorelik, Tatiana E; Schmidt, Martin U","Acta crystallographica Section B, Structural science, crystal engineering and materials",https://doi.org/10.1107/s2052520620003984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831256/,583

This study examined the effect of glucocorticoids (GCS) on the time of virus clearance and absorption of lung lesions in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS Severe and critical COVID-19 cases diagnosed in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 7 to February 10, 2020 were analyzed. The generalized linear model was utilized to assess the effects of GCS therapy on the times of nucleic acid test turning negative and improved pulmonary imaging, respectively. RESULTS Of 66 patients, 51 (77.3%) and 15 (22.7%) were severe and critical cases, respectively, and aged 62 ± 11 years. A total of 58 patients (87.9%) tested negative, and 56 (84.8%) showed improved lung imaging. Age, thrombocytopenia, CD8 + T cell count, course of GCS therapy, and total dose were correlated with the time of nucleic acid test turning negative (p < 0.05), and sex was correlated with the time of initial pulmonary imaging improvement (p < 0.05). The time of nucleic acid test turning negative in individuals with GCS therapy course ≤ 10 days was shorter than that of the GCS therapy course > 10 days group (p=0.001). No statistical difference was found in the dose, course of GCS, and initial time of improved lung imaging. CONCLUSIONS Increasing the dose of GCS and prolonging the course of treatment do not shorten the time of nucleic acid test turning negative or improved absorption of pulmonary lesions. Thus, the rational use of GCS is particularly important.","Xiong, L-Q; Jin, W; Hu, X-M; Ren, T-T; Cheng, C-H; Shaghaghi, M; Ghazi Sherbaf, F; Yu, Y; Yuan, L-H; Chen, J; Du, J",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202101_24677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33577063/,583

METHODS We searched the PubMed database using combinations of the following MeSH terms: intracranial aneurysm, radiosurgery, radiotherapy, inflammatory changes in aneurysmal walls from 1967 to 2019. RESULTS 51 studies, for a total cohort of 60 patients, are described. The median latency between the radiation treatment and the diagnosis was 9,83 years, ranging from a minimum of 0,33 to a maximum of 33. The modality of rays' administration was variable, and the dosage ranged from a minimum of 12 grays to a maximum of 177,2 grays. The anterior circulation appeared to be more frequently involved, and the most compromised vessel was the internal carotid artery. Radiation-induced vascular diseases have already been described in literature as well as RT-induced cellular and structural changes such as necrosis, macrophage or mononuclear cell infiltration, and several data support the role of inflammation in the development and remodelling of intracranial aneurysms, that, on one hand, favours them and, on the other, is necessary to their healing after endovascular treatment. CONCLUSIONS Our team suggested a new insight in the management of these vascular lesions, which corresponds to a lower threshold when deciding whether or not to treat, and a longer and stricter follow-up.","Paolucci, Aldo; Schisano, Luigi; Pluderi, Mauro; Grimoldi, Nadia; Caranci, Ferdinando; Angileri, Alessio; Arrichiello, Antonio; Costa, Antonella",Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i10-s.10281; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33245075/,583

An empirical model for the description of the temperature dependentR2relaxation rate is proposed by taking into account the temperature sensitivity of the MNP magnetization. The temperature sensitivity of the MNP magnetization (η) and the temperature sensitivity of theR2relaxation rate (κ) are simulated with the proposed empirical models to investigate their dependence on the magnetic field and the particle size. Simulation results show the existence of optimal magnetic fieldsHοηandHοκthat maximize the temperature sensitivitiesηandκ. Furthermore, simulations and experiments demonstrate that the optimal magnetic fieldHοη(Hοκ) decreases with increasing the particle size. Experiments on temperature dependentR2relaxation rate are performed at different magnetic fields for MNP samples with different iron concentration. Experimental results show that the proposed MR thermometry using MNPs as temperature sensors allows a temperature estimation accuracy of about 0.05 °C. We believe that the achieved approach of highly accurate MR thermometry is of great interest and significance to biomedicine and biology.","Zhang, Yapeng; Guo, Silin; Zhang, Pu; Zhong, Jing; Liu, Wenzhong",Nanotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/ab932b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408274/,583

BACKGROUND The contributions of PA to improvements in mental and physical health following RYGB, independent of weight loss, are unclear. METHODS Adults undergoing RYGB in a US multi-center cohort study wore an activity monitor and completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) annually ≤7 years (N = 646; 78% female, median age 47 years, median BMI 46 kg/m). Linear mixed models estimated associations of quartiles of steps, sedentary behavior (SB), and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA), respectively, with pre-to-post-surgery changes in the BDI and SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) and Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores, respectively, over 1-7 years post-surgery, with adjustment for sex, age, race, pre-surgery body mass index, the respective pre-surgery score, treatment for depression (time-varying) and pre-to-post-surgery weight change (time-varying). RESULTS There were dose-response associations between steps, SB (inverse) and MVPA quartiles, respectively, with improvements in each score. Across follow-up, mean improvements in the BDI, MCS and PCS scores, were 1.9 (95%CI, 1.0-2.8), 3.1 (95%CI, 1.5-4.7), and 4.0 (95%CI, 2.7-5.4) points higher, respectively, in the highest versus lowest steps quartile.

93968,'MI' reflections on a pandemic-governed 2020.,2020,"BACKGROUND Obesity surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity and the fastest growing area in surgery. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is the gold standard procedure in many countries. Optimization of the treatment process is important in order to keep the morbidity rate down and cost of treatment as low as possible. METHODS In September 2005, we established a bariatric surgery program. Until December 2010, 2,000 patients underwent LRYGB. Clinical pathways were established, with focus on safety, fast-track methodology and training of surgeons. Time recordings from all parts of the treatment, as well as clinical outcome, were prospectively registered. RESULTS Time consumption for the total procedure in the operating theater was reduced from 102 to 54 min (P < 0.001). With only 11 min turnover between patients, the total time for one patient has been reduced to 65 min, enabling us to perform six operations in a single operating theater during ordinary daytime. Early complication rate was 2.8%, and mean hospital stay was 2.3 days. We were able to double the patients treated in 2010 compared to 2007 with only 10% increase in staff. Three surgeons were trained during the period into fully qualified senior bariatric surgeons. CONCLUSIONS Multimodal evidence-based care within the fast-track methodology and routine time recordings was successful in order to increase the production volumes and reduce costs, without compromising the safety or quality for the patients. This kind of approach may be transferred to other types of standardized surgery.","Jacobsen, H J; Bergland, A; Raeder, J; Gislason, H G",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-011-0557-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22116595/,583

METHODS Volume and outcome data before (1/2019 - 2/2020), during (3/2020 - 4/2020), and following (5/2020 - 6/2020) the initial pandemic surge were obtained from the Vascular Quality Initiative®. Volume changes were determined using interrupted Poisson time series regression. Adjusted mortality was estimated using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS The final cohort comprised 57,181 patients from 147 US and Canadian sites. Overall procedure volumes fell 35.2% (95% CI 31.9%, 38.4%, p < 0.001) during and 19.8% (95% CI 16.8%, 22.9%, p < 0.001) following the surge, compared with presurge months. Procedure volumes fell 71.1% for claudication (95% CI 55.6%, 86.4%, p < 0.001) and 15.9% for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) (95% CI 11.9%, 19.8%, p < 0.001) but remained unchanged for acute limb ischemia (ALI) when comparing surge to presurge months. Adjusted mortality was significantly higher among those with claudication (0.5% vs 0.1%; OR 4.38 [95% CI 1.42, 13.5], p = 0.01) and ALI (6.4% vs 4.4%; OR 2.63 [95% CI 1.39, 4.98], p = 0.003) when comparing postsurge with presurge periods. CONCLUSION The first North American COVID-19 pandemic surge was associated with a significant and sustained decline in both elective and nonelective lower-extremity vascular procedural volumes. When compared with presurge patients, in-hospital mortality increased for those with claudication and ALI following the surge.","Lou, Jun-Yang; Kennedy, Kevin F; Menard, Matthew T; Abbott, J Dawn; Secemsky, Eric A; Goodney, Philip P; Saad, Marwan; Soukas, Peter A; Hyder, Omar N; Aronow, Herbert D",Vascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/1358863x211021918; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34169796/,583

Most studies were multidisciplinary interventions incorporating one or more elements of work-focused care including: work-related assessment to identify barriers to working, vocational advice/coaching or education to address barriers to working, involvement of the workplace stakeholders, restoration of fitness for work and regular communication with multidisciplinary team members. Most studies (61 %) concluded that their interventions achieved the desired work-related outcomes although firm conclusions could not be made regarding the effectiveness of a particular component, content or strategy of work-focused care itself because of the variability in the type and number of elements and outcomes used. CONCLUSIONS There is good evidence demonstrating the potential for healthcare providers to improve work outcomes for those with musculoskeletal conditions. Additional training is required to increase confidence in this area of practice. Accepting that work-focused care is important, however, does not diminish the challenge it presents.","Xie, Yanfei; Hutting, Nathan; Bartys, Serena; Johnston, Venerina",Journal of occupational rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10926-021-09971-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33811292/,583
95650,The emotional impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in women facing infertility.,2021-04-29,"PURPOSE Due to its anatomical complexity, a tracheal bronchus has important clinical implications for one-lung ventilation (OLV). We present a case of successful OLV in a patient with a high a type I (i.e., high take-off) tracheal bronchus. This anomaly presented unusual fibreoptic bronchoscopic (FOB) views that were difficult to discern from the normal carinal bifurcation. CLINICAL FEATURES A 35-yr-old male presented for posterior basal segmentectomy of the left lower lobe under video-assisted thoracoscopy. The preoperative chest radiography was reported as normal, but a computed tomography scan of the chest revealed a right upper lobe tracheal bronchus. The inlet of the tracheal bronchus was located high above the carina, and the distal trachea had significant narrowing. Because the main trachea was divided into a tracheal bronchus and a distal trachea with similar diameters and with an acute angle of divergence, FOB views of the tracheal bronchus take-off appeared similar to the normal carinal bifurcation. Moreover, the actual carina had an atypical appearance with the main bronchi shifted laterally and a blunted carinal ridge. As a result of this atypical tracheobronchial anatomy, we used an Arndt endobronchial blocker system instead of a double-lumen tube (DLT) for right-sided OLV. One-lung ventilation was satisfactory throughout the uncomplicated operation. CONCLUSION Careful preoperative assessment of tracheobronchial anatomy is imperative in order to choose an appropriate method of OLV and prevent potential complications. In a type I tracheal bronchus with a narrowed distal trachea, a bronchial blocker may have advantages over the conventional DLT in achieving OLV.","Moon, Young-Jin; Kim, Sung-Hoon; Park, Sang Wook; Lee, Yu Mi",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-014-0293-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25510236/,583

Here we introduce and develop a sustainable and biodegradable antiviral filtration membrane composed of amyloid nanofibrils made from food-grade milk proteins and iron oxyhydroxide nanoparticles synthesized in situ from iron salts by simple pH tuning. Thus, all the membrane components are made of environmentally friendly, non-toxic and widely available materials. The membrane has outstanding efficacy against a broad range of viruses, which include enveloped, non-enveloped, airborne and waterborne viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, H1N1 (the influenza A virus strain responsible for the swine flu pandemic in 2009) and enterovirus 71 (a non-enveloped virus resistant to harsh conditions, such as highly acidic pH), which highlights a possible role in fighting the current and future viral outbreaks and pandemics.","Palika, Archana; Armanious, Antonius; Rahimi, Akram; Medaglia, Chiara; Gasbarri, Matteo; Handschin, Stephan; Rossi, Antonella; Pohl, Marie O; Busnadiego, Idoia; Gübeli, Christian; Anjanappa, Ravi B; Bolisetty, Sreenath; Peydayesh, Mohammad; Stertz, Silke; Hale, Benjamin G; Tapparel, Caroline; Stellacci, Francesco; Mezzenga, Raffaele",Nature nanotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-021-00920-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34083772/,583

In the present study we report our experience with the posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy in a large group of patients with clinical or subclinical Cushing's syndrome. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between July 1994 and June 2009, 170 patients (17 males, 153 females age 50 +/- 13 years; range: 12-78 years) affected by Cushing's syndrome underwent operation via posterior retroperitoneoscopic access. Patients were divided into two groups, those with manifest Cushing's syndrome (mCS) [99 patients: 6 male, 93 female; age 45 +/- 13 years] and those with subclinical Cushing's syndrome (sCS) [71 patients: 11 male, 60 female; age: 56 +/- 11 years]. The sCS classification was assumed in cases without typical clinical symptoms but with a pathological dexamethasone suppression test. Partial adrenalectomy was performed in 35 cases (24 in the mCS-group and 11 in the sCS-group). RESULTS Mortality was zero; major complications did not occur. The incidence of postoperative minor complications was 5.3%. Mean operating time was 58 +/- 36 min (range: 20-230 min) and did not differ between mCS and sCS patients (58 versus 59 min; p = ns). Postoperative oral steroids supplementation (POSS) was administered in 136 patients (99 mCS, 37 sCS). If POSS was started, mean duration of therapy was 12.3 months (mCS) and 10.3 months (sCS) [p = 0.08], respectively. After a mean follow-up of 70.9 +/- 46.5 months the cure rate was 99.4%. CONCLUSIONS The posterior retroperitoneoscopic approach is fast and safe even in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Partial adrenalectomy represents a new option in the treatment of cortisol-producing adenomas.","Alesina, Pier F; Hommeltenberg, Silvia; Meier, Beate; Petersenn, Stephan; Lahner, Harald; Schmid, Kurt W; Mann, Klaus; Walz, Martin K",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-010-0453-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20143066/,583
96354,How is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms?,2021-04-30,"Background and aims Due to its important role in both healthy groups and those with physical, mental and behavioral disorders, impulsivity is a widely researched construct. Among various self-report questionnaires of impulsivity, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale is arguably the most frequently used measure. Despite its international use, inconsistencies in the suggested factor structure of its latest version, the BIS-11, have been observed repeatedly in different samples. The goal of the present study was therefore to test the factor structure of the BIS-11 in several samples. Methods Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on two representative samples of Hungarian adults (N = 2,457; N = 2,040) and a college sample (N = 765). Results Analyses did not confirm the original model of the measure in any of the samples. Based on explorative factor analyses, an alternative three-factor model (cognitive impulsivity; behavioral impulsivity; and impatience/restlessness) of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale is suggested. The pattern of the associations between the three factors and aggression, exercise, smoking, alcohol use, and psychological distress supports the construct validity of this new model. Discussion The new measurement model of impulsivity was confirmed in two independent samples. However, it requires further cross-cultural validation to clarify the content of self-reported impulsivity in both clinical and nonclinical samples.","Kapitány-Fövény, Máté; Urbán, Róbert; Varga, Gábor; Potenza, Marc N; Griffiths, Mark D; Szekely, Anna; Paksi, Borbála; Kun, Bernadette; Farkas, Judit; Kökönyei, Gyöngyi; Demetrovics, Zsolt",Journal of behavioral addictions,https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2020.00030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609636/,583

Despite the technological advances of digital imaging and dissector technology (ultrasonic, radiofrequency electrical, and bipolar), the inconvenient and sometimes harmful generation of a surgical plume decreases visualization, often requiring the surgeon to remove the scope from the surgical field and remove the obstructing particles. If visualization is suboptimal or lost during bleeding, the outcome can be deadly.

Therefore, we studied the association between gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), a widely used biomarker of alcohol intake, and telomere length. The possible health relevance in young adulthood was explored by investigating cardiometabolic risk factors. Mixed modelling was performed to examine GGT and alcohol consumption in association with telomere length in buccal cells of 211 adults between 18 and 30 years old of the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. In addition, we investigated the association between GGT and cardiometabolic risk factors; waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. Although we did not observe an association between self-reported alcohol consumption and telomere length, our results show that a doubling in serum GGT is associated with 7.80% (95% CI - 13.9 to - 1.2%; p = 0.02) shorter buccal telomeres, independently from sex, chronological age, educational level, zygosity and chorionicity, waist-to-hip ratio and smoking. The association between GGT was significant for all five cardiometabolic risk factors, while adjusting for age. We show that GGT, a widely used biomarker of alcohol consumption, is associated with telomere length and with risk factors of cardiometabolic syndrome, despite the young age of this study population.","Bijnens, Esmée M; Derom, Catherine; Thiery, Evert; Martens, Dries S; Loos, Ruth J F; Weyers, Steven; Nawrot, Tim S",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91987-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117333/,583
99036,Mental Health Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak in China.,2020-05-07,"BACKGROUND The objective of this review was to provide an overview of the components that comprise each of the eight barrier mesh prostheses commonly utilized for LVHR and to review the current literature related to the characteristics and effectiveness of these materials to guide the general surgeon in selecting the most appropriate material for LVHR. METHODS Composite prostheses with permanent barriers (Bard™ Composix™ E/X, Bard™ Composix™ L/P, and DUALMESH(®) Biomaterial) were compared to composite prostheses with absorbable barriers (C-QUR™ Mesh, PROCEED™ Surgical Mesh, Bard™ Sepramesh™ IP Composite, Parietex™ Composite, and PHYSIOMESH™) using scanning electron microscopy and a review of the current preclinical and clinical literature. RESULTS Clinical studies and preclinical animal models have attempted to determine the adhesion characteristics and effectiveness of barrier mesh prostheses available for ventral hernia repair applications. However, it is difficult to make any definitive statements about the adhesion characteristics and effectiveness of these materials because all meshes were not included in all studies and likewise not compared under identical conditions. Overall, Parietex™ Composite and DUALMESH(®) Biomaterial were cited most frequently for improvement of adhesion characteristics, followed closely by Bard™ Sepramesh™ IP Composite and C-QUR™ Mesh. Bard™ Composix™, PROCEED™ Surgical Mesh, and uncoated polypropylene were cited most frequently as having the most tenacious and extensive adhesions. CONCLUSIONS Differences observed between the various barrier prostheses are likely attributable to the chemical composition of the barrier or the conditions required for resorption and metabolism of the barrier components. It is likely that the components of these barriers incite a wide range of inflammatory responses resulting in the range of adhesion coverage and tenacity observed in the preclinical and clinical studies reviewed. Clinical trials are needed to more appropriately define the clinical effectiveness of these barriers.","Deeken, Corey R; Faucher, Keith M; Matthews, Brent D",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1899-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21898010/,583

Aim of Study Retrospective study aimed at correlating the maximum dose in planning target volume (PTV) with early effects of radiation. Materials and Methods Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of H and N region who received radical radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy were retrospectively analyzed for maximum dose in PTV and the requirement of gap during radiotherapy or else hospitalization for supportive care during or up to 1 month after completion of radical radiotherapy. Results Of a total of 23 patients, 8 patients (34.7%) required a gap of 2-14 days during their treatment. Twelve patients (52.1%) required hospitalization for 1-4 days and 4 patients (17.3%) required hospitalization for supportive care after completion of radiotherapy. The maximum dose in PTV ranged from 105.1% to 132.8% with an average of 112.68%. Subgroup analysis revealed a nonsignificant highest maximum dose of 114.72% in subset of patients requiring gap during radiotherapy (n= 8). Conclusion It was concluded that maximum dose in PTV is a useful predictor of need for inhospital supportive care.","Verma, Kamal; Kumawat, Naveen; Goel, Sandeep; Pande, Subodh Chandra; Sharma, Ajendra Pratap",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_902_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719262/,583

In response, they release interferons (IFNs) and activate a ubiquitously expressed pseudokinase/endoribonuclease RNase L. RNase L executes regulated RNA decay and halts global translation. Here, we developed a biosensor for 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A), the natural activator of RNase L. Using this biosensor, we found that 2-5A was acutely synthesized by cells in response to dsRNA sensing, which immediately triggered cellular RNA cleavage by RNase L and arrested host protein synthesis. However, translation-arrested cells still transcribed IFN-stimulated genes and secreted IFNs of types I and III (IFN-β and IFN-λ). Our data suggest that IFNs escape from the action of RNase L on translation. We propose that the 2-5A/RNase L pathway serves to rapidly and accurately suppress basal protein synthesis, preserving privileged production of defense proteins of the innate immune system.","Chitrakar, Alisha; Rath, Sneha; Donovan, Jesse; Demarest, Kaitlin; Li, Yize; Sridhar, Raghavendra Rao; Weiss, Susan R; Kotenko, Sergei V; Wingreen, Ned S; Korennykh, Alexei",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1818363116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30655338/,583

Many patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the University Hospital Aachen during an outbreak that first struck the Heinsberg district in February 2020. METHODS A comparative presentation of the clinical features of the first 50 COVID-19 patients with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who were hospitalized in the University Hospital Aachen. RESULTS 24 intubated patients were treated in the intensive care unit for ARDS of varying degrees of severity, while 26 patients who were breathing spontaneously without ARDS, but nevertheless needed supplemental oxygen, were treated in a separate isolation ward. The median age of the patients was 65 (IQR 58-76). The median latency from symptom onset to hospitalization was four days (IQR 1-8). Patients with ARDS had preexisting respiratory diseases more commonly than patients without ARDS (58% [95% confidence interval: 39; 76] versus 42% [26; 61]) and were more commonly overweight or obese (83% [64; 93] versus 42% [26; 61]). The two groups did not differ in viral burden but displayed significant differences in laboratory findings: ARDS patients had persistently elevated values for leukocytes, interleukin-6, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and D-dimers over the period of observation. Patients without ARDS had persistently elevated inflammatory parameters and fever for at least one week, with an accompanying need for supplemental oxygen. Three of the patients with ARDS died of multiorgan failure, while four in the non-ARDS group died of respiratory insufficiency. CONCLUSION This initial description of a cohort of COVID-19 patients with and without ARDS in Germany reveals that those with ARDS more commonly have preexisting respiratory diseases and obesity, as well as persistently elevated inflammatory markers. COVID-19 patients without ARDS may likewise require prolonged hospitalization because of persistently elevated inflammatory values with a simultaneous need for supplemental oxygen.","Dreher, Michael; Kersten, Alexander; Bickenbach, Johannes; Balfanz, Paul; Hartmann, Bojan; Cornelissen, Christian; Daher, Ayham; Stöhr, Robert; Kleines, Michael; Lemmen, Sebastian W; Brokmann, Jörg Christian; Müller, Tobias; Müller-Wieland, Dirk; Marx, Gernot; Marx, Nikolaus",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.2020.0271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32519944/,583

METHODS We discuss kidney and heart xenotransplantation, which are nearing initial clinical trials. RESULTS Life sustaining genetically modified kidney xenografts can now last for approximately 500 days and orthotopic heart xenografts for 200 days in non-human primates. Anti-swine specific antibody screening, preemptive desensitization protocols, complement inhibition and targeted immunosuppression are currently being adapted to xenotransplantation with the hope to achieve better control of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and improve xenograft longevity. These newest advances could probably facilitate future clinical trials, a significant step for the medical community, given that dialysis remains difficult for many patients and can have prohibitive costs. Performing a successful pig-to-human clinical kidney xenograft, that could last for more than a year after transplant, seems feasible but it still has significant potential hurdles to overcome. The risk/benefit balance is progressively reaching an acceptable equilibrium for future human recipients, e.g. those with a life expectancy inferior to two years. The ultimate question at this stage would be to determine if a ""proof of concept"" in humans is desirable, or whether further experimental/pre-clinical advances are still needed to demonstrate longer xenograft survival in non-human primates. CONCLUSION In this review, we discuss the most recent advances in kidney and heart xenotransplantation, with a focus on the prevention and treatment of AMR and on the recipient's selection, two aspects that will likely be the major points of discussion in the first pig organ xenotransplantation clinical trials.","Meier, Raphael P H; Longchamp, Alban; Mohiuddin, Muhammad; Manuel, Oriol; Vrakas, Georgios; Maluf, Daniel G; Buhler, Leo H; Muller, Yannick D; Pascual, Manuel",Xenotransplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/xen.12681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33759229/,583

107861,Development of a Health Policy Elective for Medical Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pilot Study.,2020,"OBJECTIVE The role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a matter of controversies. Studies based on in-hospital exposure have suggested a beneficial effect of these drugs, unlike those based on chronic exposure. We aimed to analyse RAAS blocker prescription before and during hospital stay in patients with COVID-19, and the corresponding outcomes, to explain these discrepant results. METHODS In a retrospective cohort study conducted in 347 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (Bichat Hospital, Paris, France, 23 January-29 April 2020), RAAS blocker exposure, as well as timing and reason for treatment modifications, were collected. The association between exposure and mortality within 30 days of hospital admission was analysed using logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities. RESULTS Median age was 61 [interquartile range, 51-72] years, 209 (60%) were male, 169 (49%) had a history of treated hypertension, and 117 (34%) received a RAAS blocker prior to hospitalization. RAAS blockers were discontinued within the first 7 days of hospital admission in 33% of previously treated patients (mostly driven by severity of the disease), with a corresponding mortality rate of 33%. Mortality was 8% when treatment was maintained or introduced, and 12% in patients never exposed. Adjusted odds ratios for association between exposure and mortality were 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.25-1.48) based on chronic exposure and 0.25 (0.09-0.65) based on in-hospital exposure. CONCLUSION A 'healthy user-sick stopper' bias influences RAAS blocker prescription after hospital admission for COVID-19, and explains the seemingly favourable outcome associated with in-hospital treatment.","Lahens, Alexandre; Mullaert, Jimmy; Gressens, Simon; Gault, Nathalie; Flamant, Martin; Deconinck, Laurène; Joly, Véronique; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Lescure, François-Xavier; Vidal-Petiot, Emmanuelle",Journal of hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0000000000002658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33021511/,583

METHODS Eighty-four live kidney donors were randomized in a 2 : 1 ratio to LDN (56 patients) or short-incision ODN without rib resection (28). Primary endpoints were pain relief and duration of inpatient stay. RESULTS There was no donor death or allograft thrombosis in either group. The first warm ischaemic time median (range) 4 (2-7) versus 2 (1-5) min; P = 0.001) and the duration of operation (160 (110-250) versus 150 (90-200); P = 0.004) were longer for LDN. LDN led to a reduction in parenteral morphine requirement 59 (6-136) versus 90 (35-312) mg; P = 0.001) and hospital stay (4 (2-6) versus 6 (2-9) days; P = 0.001), and earlier return to employment (42 (14-84) versus 66.5 (14-112) days; P = 0.004). Postoperative respiratory function was improved after LDN. There were more postoperative complications per donor in the ODN group (0.6(0.7) versus 0.3(0.5); P = 0.033). At a median follow-up of 74 months, there were no differences in renal function or allograft survival between the groups. CONCLUSION LDN removes some of the disincentives to live donation without compromising the outcome of the recipient transplant.","Nicholson, M L; Kaushik, M; Lewis, G R R; Brook, N R; Bagul, A; Kay, M D; Harper, S J; Elwell, R; Veitch, P S",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.6803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19937983/,583

111170,ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES SHOULD BE PRIORITY IN GLOBAL RESPONSE TO COVID-19.,2020-09-04,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems have faced unprecedented pressures. One challenge has been to promptly recognise non-COVID-19 conditions. Cognitive bias due to the availability heuristic may cause difficulties in reaching the correct diagnosis. Confirmation bias may also affect imaging interpretation. We report three cases with an alternative final diagnosis in whom COVID-19 was initially suspected: (a) Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia with unrecognised HIV infection; (b) pulmonary lymphangitis carcinomatosis; and (c) ST elevation myocardial infarction causing acute pulmonary oedema. To help mitigate bias, there is no substitute for thoughtful clinical assessment and critical appraisal when evaluating new information and formulating the differential diagnosis. LEARNING POINTS The availability heuristic during the recent pandemic may lead to cognitive bias in favour of COVID-19 diagnosis and delayed recognition of other conditions, especially in patients presenting with similar non-specific features.Confirmation bias towards COVID-19 can also affect the interpretation of pulmonary imaging which is central to the investigation of cases with suspected pneumonitis.Diagnostic bias can be mitigated by recognition and allowing time for a thorough clinical history and methodical examination of the patients.","Zieda, Anete; Sbardella, Silvia; Patel, Malika; Smith, Richard W",European journal of case reports in internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.12890/2021_002575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34123947/,583

However, conflicting data about this subject exist in patients undergoing endovascular treatment. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether thrombus imaging characteristics assessed on computed tomography are associated with outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated by endovascular treatment. Methods- The MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) Registry is an ongoing, prospective, and observational study in all centers performing endovascular treatment in the Netherlands. We evaluated associations of thrombus imaging characteristics with the functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale at 90 days), mortality, reperfusion, duration of endovascular treatment, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage using univariable and multivariable regression models. Thrombus characteristics included location, clot burden score (CBS), length, relative and absolute attenuation, perviousness, and distance from the internal carotid artery terminus to the thrombus. All characteristics were assessed on thin-slice (≤2.5 mm) noncontrast computed tomography and computed tomography angiography, acquired within 30 minutes from each other. Results- In total, 408 patients were analyzed. Thrombus with distal location, higher CBS, and shorter length were associated with better functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.0-5.3 for distal M1 occlusion compared with internal carotid artery occlusion; adjusted common odds ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.07-1.24 per CBS point; and adjusted common odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99 per mm, respectively) and reduced duration of endovascular procedure (adjusted coefficient B, -14.7; 95% CI, -24.2 to -5.1 for distal M1 occlusion compared with internal carotid artery occlusion; adjusted coefficient B, -8.5; 95% CI, -14.5 to -2.4 per CBS point; and adjusted coefficient B, 7.3; 95% CI, 2.9-11.8 per mm, respectively). Thrombus perviousness was associated with better functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02 per Hounsfield units increase). Distal thrombi were associated with successful reperfusion (adjusted odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.4-4.9 for proximal M1 occlusion compared with internal carotid artery occlusion). Conclusions- Distal location, higher CBS, and shorter length are associated with better functional outcome and faster endovascular procedure. Distal thrombus is strongly associated with successful reperfusion, and a pervious thrombus is associated with better functional outcome.","Dutra, Bruna G; Tolhuisen, Manon L; Alves, Heitor C B R; Treurniet, Kilian M; Kappelhof, Manon; Yoo, Albert J; Jansen, Ivo G H; Dippel, Diederik W J; van Zwam, Wim H; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; da Rocha, Antônio J; Lingsma, Hester F; van der Lugt, Aad; Roos, Yvo B W E M; Marquering, Henk A; Majoie, Charles B L M",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.118.024247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216961/,583
111731,Multisystemic enablers of sub-Saharan child and youth resilience to maltreatment.,2021-04-27,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic surgery changed the management of numerous surgical conditions. It was associated with many advantages over open surgery, such as decreased postoperative pain, faster recovery, shorter hospital stay and excellent cosmesis. Since two decades single-incision endoscopic surgery (SIES) was introduced to the surgical community. SIES could possibly result in even better postoperative outcomes than multi-port laparoscopic surgery, especially concerning cosmetic outcomes and pain. However, the single-incision surgical procedure is associated with quite some challenges. METHODS An expert panel of surgeons has been selected and invited to participate in the preparation of the material for a consensus meeting on the topic SIES, which was held during the EAES congress in Frankfurt, June 16, 2017. The material presented during the consensus meeting was based on evidence identified through a systematic search of literature according to a pre-specified protocol. Three main topics with respect to SIES have been identified by the panel: (1) General, (2) Organ specific, (3) New development. Within each of these topics, subcategories have been defined. Evidence was graded according to the Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence. Recommendations were made according to the GRADE criteria. RESULTS In general, there is a lack of high level evidence and a lack of long-term follow-up in the field of single-incision endoscopic surgery. In selected patients, the single-incision approach seems to be safe and effective in terms of perioperative morbidity. Satisfaction with cosmesis has been established to be the main advantage of the single-incision approach. Less pain after single-incision approach compared to conventional laparoscopy seems to be considered an advantage, although it has not been consistently demonstrated across studies. CONCLUSIONS Considering the increased direct costs (devices, instruments and operating time) of the SIES procedure and the prolonged learning curve, wider acceptance of the procedure should be supported only after demonstration of clear benefits.","Morales-Conde, Salvador; Peeters, Andrea; Meyer, Yannick M; Antoniou, Stavros A; Del Agua, Isaías Alarcón; Arezzo, Alberto; Arolfo, Simone; Yehuda, Amir Ben; Boni, Luigi; Cassinotti, Elisa; Dapri, Giovanni; Yang, Tao; Fransen, Sofie; Forgione, Antonello; Hajibandeh, Shahab; Hajibandeh, Shahin; Mazzola, Michele; Migliore, Marco; Mittermair, Christof; Mittermair, Doris; Morandeira-Rivas, Antonio; Moreno-Sanz, Carlos; Morlacchi, Andrea; Nizri, Eran; Nuijts, Myrthe; Raakow, Jonas; Sánchez-Margallo, Francisco M; Sánchez-Margallo, Juan A; Szold, Amir; Weiss, Helmut; Weiss, Michael; Zorron, Ricardo; Bouvy, Nicole D",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-06693-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30771069/,583

This study was conducted to identify which of 5 commonly used materials promotes wound healing most effectively for use on split-thickness donor sites in comparison with our standard dressing, Xeroform (petrolatum gauze). METHODS Twenty-four partial-thickness wounds were created on the backs of 4 pigs using a dermatome. Wounds (n = 4 per dressing type per pig) were treated with Xeroform, Opsite (polyurethane film), Kaltostat ( calcium sodium alginate), DuoDERM (hydrocolloid), Aquacel (hydrofiber), and Mepilex (silicone foam). Full-thickness skin samples were excised at 3 or 5 days and evaluated histologically for reepithelialization and inflammation. Comparisons also included incidence of infection, ease of use, and cost analyses. RESULTS DuoDERM elicited the greatest percent reepithelialization (81%) and Mepilex the lowest (33%) after 3 days (P = 0.004). All dressings demonstrated complete reepithelialization except Mepilex (85%) at 5 days. There were no infections and inflammation was mild among all treatments. Mepilex was easiest to use, whereas Aquacel, Kaltostat, and Opsite were most difficult (P = 0.03). Xeroform was most cost-effective and Aquacel most expensive. Combined scoring revealed DuoDERM = Xeroform > Opsite = Mepilex > Kaltostat > Aquacel. CONCLUSIONS DuoDERM and Xeroform were most effective overall. DuoDERM tended to outperform all dressings in reepithelialization at 3 days, while Xeroform was least expensive, easy to use, and demonstrated rapid reepithelialization. These findings suggest that Xeroform may be preferred for use on large donor-site areas. DuoDERM may be more appropriate for small donor sites when healing time is a priority.","Masella, Pamela C; Balent, Eric M; Carlson, Terri L; Lee, Karen W; Pierce, Lisa M",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

OBJECTIVES To assess the association between viral detection in nasopharyngeal swabs and ICU mortality in critically ill hematology patients. METHODS This was a post hoc analysis of a prospective cohort of critically ill hematology patients admitted to 17 ICUs. Nasal swabs sampled and frozen at ICU admission were tested using a multiplex PCR assay. Predictors of ICU mortality and assay positivity were identified. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of the 747 patients (447 with acute respiratory failure [ARF]), 21.3% had a virus detected (56.4% rhinovirus/enterovirus and 30.7% influenza/parainfluenza/respiratory syncytial viruses). Overall ICU and hospital mortality rates were 26% and 37%, respectively. Assay positivity was associated with lymphoproliferative disorders, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, treatment with steroids or other immunosuppressants, ARF (25.5% vs. 16.3%; P = 0.004), and death in the ICU (28.9% vs. 19.3%; P = 0.008). The association with ICU mortality was significant for all viruses and was strongest for influenza/parainfluenza/respiratory syncytial viruses. In patients with ARF, detection of any respiratory virus was independently associated with ICU mortality (odds ratio, 2.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-3.50). CONCLUSIONS Respiratory virus detection in the upper airway by multiplex PCR assay is common in critically ill hematology patients. In patients with ARF, respiratory virus detection was independently associated with ICU mortality. Multiplex PCR assay may prove helpful for the risk stratification of hematology patients with ARF. Studies to understand whether respiratory tract viruses play a causal role in outcomes are warranted.","Legoff, Jérôme; Zucman, Noémie; Lemiale, Virginie; Mokart, Djamel; Pène, Frédéric; Lambert, Jérôme; Kouatchet, Achille; Demoule, Alexandre; Vincent, François; Nyunga, Martine; Bruneel, Fabrice; Contejean, Adrien; Mercier-Delarue, Séverine; Rabbat, Antoine; Lebert, Christine; Perez, Pierre; Meert, Anne-Pascale; Benoit, Dominique; Schwebel, Carole; Jourdain, Mercé; Darmon, Michael; Resche-Rigon, Matthieu; Azoulay, Elie",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201804-0681oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30230909/,583

Although its prevalence is decreasing worldwide, few studies have examined the prevalence of anemia in Korean adolescents. Purpose This study aimed to determine the prevalence of anemia in Korean adolescents over the past 21 years using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Methods We investigated the prevalence of anemia in adolescents aged 10-18 years for the period 1998-2018 according to sex, age, residential area, and household income. The effects of menarche age and menstruation were examined in female adolescents for the period 2001-2018. Results Among the total 11,782 participants, the weighted prevalence of anemia was 4.0%. The prevalence of anemia in male participants significantly decreased (from 3.0% to 0.5%, p < 0.001), whereas that in female participants did not change significantly over time (from 7.9% to 8.5%, p = 0.054). The average age at menarche was 12.4 ± 0.0 years; the prevalence of anemia in females increased from age 13 years onward. Multivariate analysis revealed that anemia was more common in female than male participants (odds ratio [OR], 9.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.19-13.57; p < 0.001). In female adolescents, the prevalence of anemia increased with age (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.15-1.38, p < 0.001) and was 3.6 times higher after than before menarche (OR, 3.65; 95% CI, 2.21-6.05, p < 0.001). Conclusion Over the 21-year study period, the prevalence of anemia decreased among male adolescents but did not change in female adolescents.

119798,Corrigendum.,2017,"BACKGROUND In order to optimize postoperative therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), it is important to detect endoscopic recurrence preceding clinical recurrence. However, we have little knowledge about how high the rate of residual lesions is and whether these lesions have an influence on postoperative course or not. AIMS To assess residual lesions in small bowel immediately after surgery. METHODS Capsule endoscopy (CE) was performed immediately after surgery (< 3 months), and endoscopic activity was assessed using the Lewis score (LS) composed of the highest tertile score (in first, second, and third tertile) and the stenosis score (in whole small intestine). The relationship between these residual lesions and postoperative clinical recurrence was prospectively evaluated. RESULTS After assessing patency using a patency capsule, CE was performed in 25 patients. The mean LS was 751.3, and 84.0% (21/25) had endoscopic activity. These lesions were detected by preoperative examinations in 0% and by a serosal side view during surgery in 16.0%. Regarding the cumulative clinical recurrence rate according to endoscopic severity (normal, mild, and moderate-to-severe) immediately after surgery, no significant difference was found. However, comparing groups divided according to the highest tertile score, the cumulative clinical recurrence rate was significantly higher in the group with the highest third tertile score. Furthermore, patients with ulcers in the third tertile had a significantly higher recurrence rate. CONCLUSIONS Many cases with CD had endoscopic activity immediately after ""curative"" surgery. These residual lesions, especially in the distal small intestine, were associated with postoperative clinical recurrence.","Kusaka, Jun; Shiga, Hisashi; Kuroha, Masatake; Kimura, Tomoya; Kakuta, Yoichi; Endo, Katsuya; Kinouchi, Yoshitaka; Shimosegawa, Tooru",Digestive diseases and sciences,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-018-4942-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29380174/,583

The combination of drought and COVID-19 can lead to a compounding impact on farming sectors, including crop yield. This study investigated the potential impact of drought, COVID-19, and their compound effect on three major crop yields in 2020. The analysis was carried out using the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) concept to model the spatially varying relationship between Standardized precipitation evaporation index (SPEI), COVID-19 incidence rate, and three crop yields (corn, soybeans, and wheat) across the counties located in the USA. The GWR model was suitable for capturing local scale crop variability, and the potential hotspots are identified where the compound effect is dominant. Although the drought in 2020 was not extreme compared to the past events, the median crop yield during 2020 for the three crop yields was lower than their historical (1980-2020) median values, which highlights the potential role of COVID-19 on reduced crop yields. The compound effect of drought and COVID-19 seem to vary in terms of crop and region wise. For example, the compound effect on corn was prominent in Central California and several counties in Midwest USA. In contrast, the effect was more in eastern South Dakota, Colorado, and more scattered for wheat.","Yaddanapudi, Ramprasad; Mishra, Ashok K",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34626632/,583

RECENT FINDINGS Chronic lung disease was the most common comorbidity in hospitalized PWH in New York and second-most common condition in ambulatory PWH in Canada. The elevated risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in PWH has been widely recognized, but PWH are also at higher risk for asthma and worse asthma outcomes. Expanded assessments of lung structure and function, such as single-breath diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and chest computed tomography (CT) have provided new insights into HIV effects on the lungs. New biomarker analyses are emerging, but further studies are needed to validate predictive biomarkers for chronic lung disease in PWH. Clinical trials addressing chronic lung disease in PWH are few in number. SUMMARY Chronic lung disease is a common and high-impact comorbidity among PWH. Future studies should collect more comprehensive lung assessments such as DLCO, FeNO, and chest CT in order to better phenotype lung derangements in HIV. Clinical trials are desperately needed to reduce the rising burden of chronic lung disease in PWH.","Kunisaki, Ken M",Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1097/coh.0000000000000679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33797432/,583

Traditionally mid-esophageal diverticula are approached by thoracotomy or thoracoscopy, with the laparoscopic technique being reserved for epiphrenic diverticula. A 78-year-old Caucasian female with a secondary dilatative ischemic cardiomyopathy presented with dysphagia, tenderness in the epigastrium and a considerable weight loss. A large mid-esophageal diverticulum was found on barium swallow and confirmed by CT scan. Underlying achalasia was recorded on manometry. The patient underwent diverticulectomy via transhiatal approach, followed by Heller myotomy and Dor fundoplication. Throughout the procedure auxiliary, esophagoscopic image was provided by interventional gastroenterologist due to a very narrow operating field and lack of orientation points. Based on our experience with this case, we propose transhiatal approach as a feasible alternative to thoracoscopy, in particular with patients who suffer from cardiac or pulmonary co-morbidities which make traditional techniques of high risk.","Tokic, Tomislav; Kirac, Iva; Hrabar, Davor; Troskot, Branko; Bekavac-Beslin, Miroslav",Journal of surgical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1093/jscr/rjy066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29657705/,583

The study aimed to estimate overall and regional excess all-cause mortality during the pandemic in Korea. METHODS We obtained all-cause death data and population statistics from January 2010 to December 2020. The expected mortality in 2020 was estimated using a quasi-Poisson regression model. The model included death year, seasonal variation, cold wave (January), average death counts in the previous month, and population. Excess mortality was defined as the difference between the observed mortality and the expected mortality. Regions were classified into three areas according to the numbers of COVID-19 cases. RESULTS There was no annual excess all-cause mortality in 2020 at the national and regional level compared to the average death for the previous ten years. The observed mortality in 2020 was 582.9 per 100,000 people, and the expected mortality was 582.3 per 100,000 people (95% confidence interval, 568.3-596.7). However, we found monthly and regional variations depending on the waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea. While the mortality in August, October, and November exceeded the expected range, the mortality in September was lower than the expected range. The months in which excess deaths were identified differed by region. CONCLUSION Our results show that the mortality in 2020 was similar to the historical trend. However, in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be necessary to regularly investigate COVID-19-related mortality and determine its direct and indirect causes.","Shin, Min Sun; Sim, Boram; Jang, Won Mo; Lee, Jin Yong",Journal of Korean medical science,https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34636505/,583

124067,Psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreak on health workers in a university hospital in Turkey.,2021-03-16,"Oil spills in Arctic marine environments are expected to increase concurrently with the expansion of shipping routes and petroleum exploitation into previously inaccessible ice-dominated regions. Most research on oil biodegradation focusses on the bulk oil, but the fate of the water-accommodated fraction (WAF), mainly composed of toxic aromatic compounds, is largely underexplored. To evaluate the bacterial degradation capacity of such dissolved aromatics in Greenlandic seawater, microcosms consisting of 0 °C seawater polluted with WAF were investigated over a 3-month period. With a half-life (t1/2) of 26 days, m-xylene was the fastest degraded compound, as measured by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. Substantial slower degradation was observed for ethylbenzene, naphthalenes, phenanthrene, acenaphthylene, acenaphthene and fluorenes with t1/2 of 40-105 days. Colwellia, identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, was the main potential degrader of m-xylene. This genus occupied up to 47 % of the bacterial community until day 10 in the microcosms. Cycloclasticus and Zhongshania aliphaticivorans, potentially utilizing one-to three-ringed aromatics, replaced Colwellia between day 10 and 96 and occupied up to 6 % and 23 % of the community, respectively. Although most of the WAF can ultimately be eliminated in microcosms, our results suggest that the restoration of an oil-impacted Arctic environment may be slow as most analysed compounds had t1/2 of over 2-3 months and the detrimental effects of a spill towards the marine ecosystem likely persist during this time.","Gomes, Ana; Christensen, Jan H; Gründger, Friederike; Kjeldsen, Kasper Urup; Rysgaard, Søren; Vergeynst, Leendert",Chemosphere,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399257/,583
125035,Work stress-related problems in physicians in the time of COVID-19.,2021-01-08,"Introduction and Objective Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD) has become an increasingly utilized approach to treating various bladder pathologies requiring extirpation. As surgeons have become more experienced with ICUD, especially with lesser-used diversions such as continent cutaneous reservoirs, the technique has evolved. Methods We describe our technique and recent advances in the practical creation of robotic ICUD with a continent catheterizable pouch (CCP) built upon the open principles of the previously described ""Indiana Pouch, "" which uses the distal ileum and right colon. Modifications in anatomic mobilization and exposure, bowel segmentation using novel robotic bowel staplers, catheterizable channel creation, and addition of ileal chimney for uretero-enteric anastomoses are highlighted. The addition of the ileal chimney allows for ease of reconstruction in a fashion familiar to surgeons accustomed to performing intracorporeal ileal conduit and, therefore, may result in lower ureteroenteric stricture rates. Table 1 demonstrates the supplies used intraoperatively. Use of indocyanine green to assess vascularity in bowel and ureter intraoperatively is demonstrated. The port configurations are demonstrated using the DaVinci ® Xi platform. Also described are short-term outcomes of our initial experience. Results Eleven consecutive patients (5 female) who have undergone ICUD with CCP were included. Of the eleven seven had malignant indications (bladder or urethral cancer) while 4 were for benign causes (2 radiation cystitis 2 interstitial cystitis). Mean blood loss was 235cc (range 100-500cc) and mean operative time was 8.5 h (range 7-13). There were no conversions to an open procedure and no patient required a blood transfusion. Hospital stay was 7.2 days on average (range 4-18) with no 30-day post-discharge readmissions. One patient had a Clavien grade 3 or greater complication at 30 days (Table 2). No urine leaks or bowel leaks were observed and no patien experienced stomal stenosis or uretero-enteric stenosis. At three months follow up, all patients were continent and satisfied with their diversion. Conclusions RARC with CCP ICUD is a safe and effective approach to bladder removal and reconstruction. As more surgeons utilize RARC, growing attention to techniques of intracorporeal reconstruction will allow further implementation of this technique to cystectomy patients. Patients with adequate renal function (glomerular filtration rate of 40 mL/min or greater) and hepatic function, who understand the requirement for regular clean intermittent-catheterization and who possess mental acuity and manual dexterity to empty their pouch 4-6 times daily should be offered CCP ICUD as a reconstructive option following RARC.","Matulewicz, Richard S; Chesnut, Gregory T; Huang, Chun C; Bochner, Bernard H; Goh, Alvin C",Urology video journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urolvj.2019.100020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31893282/,583

METHOD A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and PubMed databases was completed on 26th October 2017 using Medical Subject Heading terms synonymous with BPP and speech, language, or oral motor impairment. In total, 2411 papers were identified and 48 met inclusion criteria. RESULTS Expressive and receptive language impairment and oral structural and functional deficits are frequent in BPP. Expressive deficits are frequently more severe than receptive. Only one study used formal assessments to demonstrate the presence of speech disorder, namely dysarthria. Seven studies reported an association between diffuse BPP and more severe language impairment. INTERPRETATION Findings confirmed that language deficits are common in BPP, though assessment of the specific speech phenotype is limited. The paucity of high quality studies detailing the specific communication phenotype of BPP highlights the need for further investigation. Improving understanding of this phenotype will inform the development of targeted therapies and lead to better long-term outcomes. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS Speech, language, and oral functional impairments are common in individuals with bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria. Posterior polymicrogyria is associated with a less severe language impairment than anterior polymicrogyria. Deeper investigation of speech is needed to understand implicated networks in this malformation.","Braden, Ruth O; Leventer, Richard J; Jansen, Anna; Scheffer, Ingrid E; Morgan, Angela T",Developmental medicine and child neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/dmcn.14153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30680716/,583

More information is needed to understand the mechanisms by which probiotics maintain the growth performance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a probiotic based on Bacillus subtilis bacteria on growth related mechanisms of broilers under heat stress conditions. Specifically, growth performance, skeletal bone characteristics, skeletal muscles size, intestinal villus-crypt structure, intestinal bacteria, growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), cholesterol, and glucose. A total of 1200 one day old Ross 308 male broilers were randomly distributed into 4 treatments, with 12 replicates per treatment and 25 birds per replicate. A 2 × 2 factorial arrangement was used; the main factors were environmental temperature (thermoneutral or heat stress) and diet (control or control + B. subtilis; 3 × 107 cfu/kg of feed). From d 22 to 35 of age, birds were either exposed to thermoneutral conditions (21 °C) or chronic heat stress (30 °C). During the same period, each group was divided into 2 subgroups and fed either the control diet or the B. subtilis supplemented diet. The results demonstrated that B. subtilis had positive effects (P < 0.05) on the body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, villus height, crypt depth, villus surface area, absorptive epithelial cell area and viable counts of intestinal beneficial bacteria. B. subtilis increased (P < 0.05) serum GH, IGF-1 and maintain normal levels of cholesterol and glucose under heat stress conditions. In addition, broilers fed B. subtilis under heat stress conditions exhibited higher (P < 0.05) skeletal muscles size and improved (P < 0.05) tibia traits and lower (P < 0.05) abdominal fat pads deposition compared with the controls. B. subtilis had no effect on rectal temperature under thermoneutral or heat stress conditions. It is concluded that B. subtilis can be used as growth promoters in broilers, particularly during the periods of heat stress conditions.","Abdelqader, Anas; Abuajamieh, Mohannad; Hayajneh, Firas; Al-Fataftah, Abdur-Rahman",Journal of thermal biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888580/,583
127033,History of the american college health association.,2011,"Intracranial aneurysms are relatively frequently encountered in patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs). They may be located on the circle of Willis, on arterial feeders, or even inside the nidus. Because BAVM-associated aneurysms represent a risk factor of bleeding, the question of the timing and modality of their management remains a matter of debate in unruptured BAVMs. The authors present a case of fatal periprocedural rupture of a flow-related aneurysm (FRA) during the removal of the microcatheter after injection of a liquid embolic agent. A 40-year-old man was treated at the authors' institution for the management of a Spetzler-Martin Grade III left unruptured frontal BAVM, revealed by seizures and a focal neurological deficit attributed to flow steal phenomenon. After a multidisciplinary meeting, endovascular treatment was considered to reduce the flow of the BAVM. A proximal FRA located on the feeding internal carotid artery (ICA) was purposely left untreated because it did not meet the criteria of the authors' institution for preventative treatment (i.e., small size [2.5 mm]). During embolization, at the time of microcatheter retrieval, and after glue injection, the aneurysm unexpectedly ruptured. The aneurysm's rupture was attributed to the stress (torsion/flexion) on the ICA caused by the microcatheter removal. Despite the attempts to manage the bleeding, the patient eventually died of the acute increase of intracranial pressure related to the massive subarachnoid hemorrhage. This case highlights a previously unreported mechanism of FRA rupture during BAVM embolization: the stress transmitted to the parent artery during the removal of the microcatheter.","Gabrieli, Joseph; Clarençon, Frédéric; Di Maria, Federico; Fahed, Robert; Boch, Anne-Laure; Degos, Vincent; Chiras, Jacques; Sourour, Nader-Antoine",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2014.11.jns132515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25574569/,583

H. pylori is also a class I carcinogen of gastric cancer. VacA is the only exocrine toxin of H. pylori, which plays a very important role in the pathogenesis of H. pylori. The production of VacA in natural circumstances is complex with heavy workload and low yield. Therefore, it is very important to obtain recombinant VacA protein which is stable and biologically active. This study therefore aims to explore the expression, purification and stable storage of VacA toxin of H. pylori in E.coli, and to provide experimental basis for further exploration of the role of VacA in H. pylori -induced inflammation of cancer. RESULTS A 2502-bp fragment and VacA gene were identified. An 89.7-kDa VacA34-854 recombinant protein was expressed and purified from the recombinant engineering bacteria and was preserved stably in 50 mM acetic acid buffer (pH 2.9). The amount of the recombinant protein was larger in the inclusion bodies than in the supernatant. In addition, after a 24-h culture with VacA recombinant protein, GES-1 cells demonstrated evidence of apoptosis including early nuclear immobilization and clustering under inverted microscope and TEM. It was found that VacA recombinant protein induced apoptosis by TUNEL assay. CONCLUSIONS A VacA recombinant protein that is stably and highly expressed and possesses pro-apoptotic activity is successfully constructed. The protein is stably preserved in 50 mM acetic acid buffer (pH 2.9).","Yuan, Ling-Zhi; Shi, Xiao; Tang, Dan; Zheng, Shao-Peng; Xiao, Zhi-Ming; Wang, Fen",BMC microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12866-021-02262-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407768/,583

128202,"Factors Associated With Suicidal Ideation in Older Adults From Three Cities in Colombia, 2016.",2020,"BACKGROUND Several studies reported the dysregulation of miR-541 in the progression of some human malignancies. Osteosarcoma (OS) is one of the most common primary malignant bone tumors. This study aimed to assess the expression and clinical significance of miR-541 in OS patients and explore the biological function of miR-541 in tumor progression. METHODS Expression of miR-541 was detected by quantitative real-time PCR, and its prognostic value was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The biological function of miR-541 was examined by analyzing its effects on OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Additionally, the underlying potential target of miR-541 was predicated and analyzed. RESULTS The expression of miR-541 was significantly decreased in OS tissues and cell lines. The deregulated expression of miR-541 in tumor tissues was associated with the overall survival of OS patients and was a potential independent prognostic indicator. In OS cells, the overexpression of miR-541 could inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The luciferase activity results indicated that TGIF2 was a potential target of miR-541. CONCLUSION The results of this study revealed that the decreased miR-541 expression in OS patients may serve as a prognostic biomarker, and that the overexpression of miR-541 in OS cells results in inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, indicating the potential of miR-541 as a therapeutic target in OS treatment.","Liu, Chunlei; Yi, Xiuling",Diagnostic pathology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13000-020-01008-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709240/,583

Isothermal nucleic acid amplification technologies eliminate the need for thermal cycling; however, fluorescence-based detection of products is still required for real-time, quantitative results. Several portable isothermal heaters with integrated fluorescence detection are now commercially available; however, the cost of these devices remains a significant barrier to widespread adoption in resource-limited settings.

Our null hypothesis was that concomitant sacrocolpopexy and TVT exacerbate OAB symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a prospective cohort study. All subjects had apical/anterior prolapse and underwent robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy and TVT, with or without concomitant hysterectomy. All subjects completed a standardized one-year follow-up between 2009 and 2014. To assess for OAB symptoms, we used the Urogenital Distress Inventory subscale questions #15 and/or question #16. Reponses to these questions are based on a five-point 0 to 4 Likert scale (0 represents a negative response or no symptoms, and 4 represents the most problems). Any patient who answered 1 or higher on the Likert scale, either on the frequency or urge incontinence question, was defined as having OAB symptoms. RESULTS Sixty-six subjects completed 12 months of visits. Preoperatively, 54 patients (83%) had OAB symptoms, and postoperatively 29 patients (45%) had OAB symptoms (p<0.001). Patients with postoperative OAB had a lower patient global impression of improvement (PGI-I) scores, PGI-I 5.8 with OAB, and PGI-I 6.6 without OAB (p<0.003). CONCLUSION We found that sacrocolpopexy and concomitant retropubic midurethral sling does not contribute to additive OAB symptoms, and symptoms actually resolved in 38% of women in our cohort. The presence of postoperative OAB contributes to lower global impression of improvement.","Aslam, Muhammad Faisal; Gregory, William T; Osmundsen, Blake",Journal of the Turkish German Gynecological Association,https://doi.org/10.4274/jtgga.2016.0176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28506944/,583

Bronchoscopy examination and biopsy indicated large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) in the take-off of RUL bronchus. No metastatic focus was found after emission computed tomography (ECT) scan of whole body bone, abdominal US scanning and brain MR. After initial evaluation, the clinical stage before operation was cT2bN0M0 (IIA stage). A selective video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) operation was arranged after 9 days of smoking cessation. Lateral position, one 10 mm trocar for camera in the 7th intercostals space in the mid-auxiliary line, 4 cm trocar for operation in the 4th intercostal space in the anterior axillary line, 15 mm trocar for auxiliary operation in the 8th intercostal space in the scapula line, the patient received VATS RUL lobectomy, plus systemic mediastinal lymph nodes dissection. The procedure of 200 minutes operation was smooth with blood loss of about 150 mL. Chest tube was removed 6 days after operation, and the patient discharged 11 days after the operation; The post-operation pathological examination showed RUL LCNEC, and the pathological stage was pT2bN0M0R0 (IIA stage). The patient has received four cycles of EP adjuvant chemotherapy per 21 days and is still alive without disease recurrence and metastasis after re-examination.","Xiong, Fei; Wang, Sheng; Kai, Jindan",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2014.12.03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589983/,583
135986,Mentoring the working nurse: a scoping review.,2020-07-29,"BACKGROUND Estimating the sizes of populations at highest risk for HIV is essential for developing and monitoring effective HIV prevention and treatment programs. We provide several country examples of how service multiplier methods have been used in respondent-driven sampling surveys and provide guidance on how to maximize this method's use. METHODS Population size estimates were conducted in 4 countries (Mauritius- intravenous drug users [IDU] and female sex workers [FSW]; Papua New Guinea-FSW and men who have sex with men [MSM]; Thailand-IDU; United States-IDU) using adjusted proportions of population members reporting attending a service, project or study listed in a respondent-driven sampling survey, and the estimated total number of population members who visited one of the listed services, projects, or studies collected from the providers. RESULTS The median population size estimates were 8866 for IDU and 667 for FSW in Mauritius. Median point estimates for FSW were 4190 in Port Moresby and 8712 in Goroka, Papua New Guinea, and 2,126 for MSM in Port Moresby and 4200 for IDU in Bangkok, Thailand. Median estimates for IDU were 1050 in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and 15,789 in 2005 and 15,554 in 2009 in San Francisco. CONCLUSION Our estimates for almost all groups in each country fall within the range of other regional and national estimates, indicating that the service multiplier method, assuming all assumptions are met, can produce informative estimates. We suggest using multiple multipliers whenever possible, garnering program data from the widest possible range of services, projects, and studies. A median of several estimates is likely more robust to potential biases than a single estimate.","Johnston, Lisa G; Prybylski, Dimitri; Raymond, H Fisher; Mirzazadeh, Ali; Manopaiboon, Chomnad; McFarland, Willi",Sexually transmitted diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/olq.0b013e31827fd650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23486495/,583
136634,Evidence-based occupational health and safety interventions: a comprehensive overview of reviews.,2019-12-11,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Mechanical thrombectomy is beneficial for patients with acute ischemic stroke and a proximal anterior occlusion, but it is unclear if these results can be extrapolated to patients with an M2 occlusion. The purpose of this study was to examine the technical aspects, safety, and outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever in patients with an isolated M2 occlusion who were included in 3 large multicenter prospective studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS We included patients from the Solitaire Flow Restoration Thrombectomy for Acute Revascularization (STAR), Solitaire With the Intention For Thrombectomy (SWIFT), and Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment (SWIFT PRIME) studies, 3 large multicenter prospective studies on thrombectomy for ischemic stroke. We compared outcomes and technical details of patients with an M2 with those with an M1 occlusion. All patients were treated with a stent retriever. Imaging data and outcomes were scored by an independent core laboratory. Successful reperfusion was defined as modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b/3. RESULTS We included 50 patients with an M2 and 249 patients with an M1 occlusion. Patients with an M2 occlusion were older (mean age, 71 versus 67 years; P = .04) and had a lower NIHSS score (median, 13 versus 17; P < .001) compared with those with an M1 occlusion. Procedural time was nonsignificantly shorter in patients with an M2 occlusion (median, 29 versus 35 minutes; P = .41). The average number of passes with a stent retriever was also nonsignificantly lower in patients with an M2 occlusion (mean, 1.4 versus 1.7; P = .07). There were no significant differences in successful reperfusion (85% versus 82%, P = .82), symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages (2% versus 2%, P = 1.0), device-related serious adverse events (6% versus 4%, P = .46), or modified Rankin Scale score 0-2 at follow-up (60% versus 56%, P = .64).

137391,Changes in major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders in the national French working population between 2006 and 2010.,2015,"BACKGROUND Depression is a leading cause of disease burden worldwide but is often undertreated in low- and middle-income countries. Reasons behind the treatment gap vary, but many highlight a lack of interventions which speak to the socio-economic and structural realties that are associated to mental health problems in many settings, including South Africa. The COURRAGE-PLUS intervention responds to this gap, by combining a collective narrative therapy (9 weeks) intervention, with a social intervention promoting group-led practical action against structural determinants of poor mental health (4 weeks), for a total of 13 sessions. The overall aim is to promote mental health, while empowering communities to acknowledge, and respond in locally meaningful ways to social adversity linked to development of mental distress. AIM To pilot and evaluate the effectiveness of a complex intervention - COURRAGE-PLUS on symptoms of depression as assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) among a sample of women facing contexts of adversity in Gauteng, South Africa. METHODS PHQ-9 scores were assessed at baseline, post collective narrative therapy (midline), and post social intervention (endline). Median scores and corresponding interquartile ranges were computed for all time points. Differences in scores between time points were tested with a non-parametric Friedman test. The impact across symptom severities was compared descriptively to identify potential differences in impact across categories of symptom severity within our sample. RESULTS Participants' (n = 47) median depression score at baseline was 11 (IQR = 7) and reduced to 4 at midline (IQR = 7) to 0 at endline (IQR = 2.5). The Friedman test showed a statistically significant difference between depression scores across time points, χ2(2) = 49.29, p < .001. Median depression scores were reduced to 0 or 1 Post-Intervention across all four severity groups. CONCLUSIONS COURRAGE-PLUS was highly effective at reducing symptoms of depression across the spectrum of severities in this sample of women facing adversity, in Gauteng, South Africa. Findings supports the need for larger trials to investigate collective narrative storytelling and social interventions as community-based interventions for populations experiencing adversity and mental distress.","Burgess, Rochelle A; Jeske, Niklas; Rasool, Shahana; Ahmad, Ayesha; Kydd, Anna; Ncube Mlilo, Ncazelo",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640211010203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33855902/,583
137960,Work-related stress in specialists in occupational health in Croatia: a pilot study.,2020-12-31,"Optical biosensors are low-cost, sensitive and portable devices that are poised to revolutionize the medical industry. Healthcare monitoring has already been transformed by such devices, with notable recent applications including heart rate monitoring in smartwatches and COVID-19 lateral flow diagnostic test kits. The commercial success and impact of existing optical sensors has galvanized research in expanding its application in numerous disciplines. Drug detection and monitoring seeks to benefit from the fast-approaching wave of optical biosensors, with diverse applications ranging from illicit drug testing, clinical trials, monitoring in advanced drug delivery systems and personalized drug dosing. The latter has the potential to significantly improve patients' lives by minimizing toxicity and maximizing efficacy. To achieve this, the patient's serum drug levels must be frequently measured. Yet, the current method of obtaining such information, namely therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), is not routinely practiced as it is invasive, expensive, time-consuming and skilled labor-intensive. Certainly, optical sensors possess the capabilities to challenge this convention. This review explores the current state of optical biosensors in personalized dosing with special emphasis on TDM, and provides an appraisal on recent strategies. The strengths and challenges of optical biosensors are critically evaluated, before concluding with perspectives on the future direction of these sensors.","Ong, Jun Jie; Pollard, Thomas D; Goyanes, Alvaro; Gaisford, Simon; Elbadawi, Mohammed; Basit, Abdul W",Biosensors & bioelectronics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.113331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34038838/,583
138992,Analyses of Original and Computationally-Derived Electronic Health Record Data: The National COVID Cohort Collaborative.,2021-09-12,"OBJECTIVES When patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome are moved out of an intensive care unit, the ventilator often requires changing. This procedure suppresses positive end expiratory pressure and promotes lung derecruitment. Clamping the endotracheal tube may prevent this from occurring. Whether or not such clamping maintains positive end-expiratory pressure has never been investigated. We designed a bench study to explore this further. HOW THE STUDY WAS DONE We used the Elysee 350 ventilator in 'volume controlled' mode with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, connected to an endotracheal tube with an 8 mm internal diameter inserted into a lung model with 40 ml/cmH2O compliance and 10 cmH2O/L/s resistance. We measured airway pressure and flow between the distal end of the endotracheal tube and the lung model. We tested a plastic, a metal, and an Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation clamp, each with an oral/nasal, a nasal, and a reinforced endotracheal tube. We performed an end-expiratory hold then clamped the endotracheal tube and disconnected the ventilator. We measured the change in airway pressure and volume for 30 s following the disconnection of the ventilator. RESULTS Airway pressure decreased thirty seconds after disconnection with all combinations of clamp and endotracheal tube. The largest fall in airway pressure (-17.486 cmH2O/s at 5 s and -18.834 cmH2O/s at 30 s) was observed with the plastic clamp combined with the reinforced endotracheal tube. The smallest decrease in airway pressure (0 cmH2O/s at 5 s and -0.163 cmH2O/s at 30 s) was observed using the Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation clamp with the nasal endotracheal tube. CONCLUSIONS Only the Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation clamp was efficient. Even with an Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation clamp, it is important to limit the duration the ventilator is disconnected to a few seconds (ideally 5 s).","Turbil, Emanuele; Terzi, Nicolas; Schwebel, Carole; Cour, Martin; Argaud, Laurent; Guérin, Claude",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32160252/,583

Direct economic loss is expected to be much more than that of SARS outbreak in 2003. The risk factors of COVID-19 epidemic at the early stage incluede the misjudgment of the epidemic, delay in reporting this emerging infectious disease, nosocomial infection-caused transmission of the virus into local communities, and weak public health interventions. The infection rate (or the incidence) reflects the prophylactic effect in population. Case fatality reflects the therapeutic effect of clinical intervention. There were sufficient medical resources at the national top levels accumulated in Wuhan. Furthermore, medical professionals and sufficient medical supplies from other provinces have been assigned to join in the fighting against the epidemic in Wuhan. However, the case fatality in Wuhan has being kept the highest in China, indicating that clinical treatment for this virus-caused emerging infectious disease, whose pathogenesis remains to be elucidated, had a limited effect in controlling this epidemic. The unusual, extremely costly public health interventions including the temporarily city quarantine and transportation ban issued by the central government are crucial in controlling this epidemic. The control of epidemic indicates the importance of public health measures but also reflected its insufficient capacity in China. Recently, profit-seeking mechanism run in Chinese health service system disorganized the balance of clinical service and public health service patterns in China, promoting the vicious circle of ""attaching importance to clinical treatment and despising disease prophylaxis"" , damaging the infrastructure of public health capacity, thus contributing to the formation of the inevitability in various fortuities of public health emergency. To strength the capacity of our medical service system to respond to public health emergency efficiently, two key issues should be considered. First, public health service, which should be fixed as the health section of the governments' public services by the law, must be greatly improved to meet the increasing health needs of the publics. Second, the vicious circle of profit-seeking-caused ""attaching importance to clinical treatment and despising disease prophylaxis"" should be immediately broken to optimize the national health service system in China by increasing the investment in public health service.","Cao, G W; Zhang, B X; Chen, X P",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200304-00247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32498493/,583

In this pilot study, we examine lung compartment-specific protein expression to identify pathways linked to development and progression of pulmonary sarcoidosis. We characterized bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and fluid (BALF) proteins in recently diagnosed sarcoidosis cases. We identified 4,306 proteins in BAL cells, of which 272 proteins were differentially expressed in sarcoidosis compared to controls. These proteins map to novel pathways such as integrin-linked kinase and IL-8 signaling and previously implicated pathways in sarcoidosis, including phagosome maturation, clathrin-mediated endocytic signaling and redox balance. In the BALF, the differentially expressed proteins map to several pathways identified in the BAL cells. The differentially expressed BALF proteins also map to aryl hydrocarbon signaling, communication between innate and adaptive immune response, integrin, PTEN and phospholipase C signaling, serotonin and tryptophan metabolism, autophagy, and B cell receptor signaling. Additional pathways that were different between progressive and non-progressive sarcoidosis in the BALF included CD28 signaling and PFKFB4 signaling. Our studies demonstrate the power of contemporary proteomics to reveal novel mechanisms operational in sarcoidosis.

Little is known about how this tempest of neural activity restructuring impacts the stability of network states in recurrent cortical circuits. To investigate this issue, we reanalyzed data in which we recorded for 14 days via population calcium imaging the activity of the same neural populations of pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 and layer 5 of forelimb motor and pre-motor cortex in mice during the daily learning of a lever-press task. We found that motor cortex network states remained stable with respect to the critical network state during the extensive reorganization of both neural population activity and its relation to lever movement throughout learning. Specifically, layer 2/3 cortical circuits unceasingly displayed robust evidence for operating at the critical network state, a regime that maximizes information capacity and transmission, and provides a balance between network robustness and flexibility. In contrast, layer 5 circuits operated away from the critical network state for all 14 days of recording and learning. In conclusion, this result indicates that the wide-ranging malleability of synapses, neurons, and neural connectivity during learning operates within the constraint of a stable and layer-specific network state regarding dynamic criticality, and suggests that different cortical layers operate under distinct constraints because of their specialized goals.","Ma, Zhengyu; Liu, Haixin; Komiyama, Takaki; Wessel, Ralf",Journal of neurophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00061.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937084/,583

Standardised transition care improves short and long-term patient outcomes. This study aimed to detail the current state of transition services for IBD in the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS We performed a nationwide study to ascertain current practice, facilities and resources for children and young people with IBD. Specialist paediatric IBD centres were invited to contribute data on; 1) Timing of transition/transfer of care, 2) Transition resources available including clinics, staff, and patient information, 3) Planning for future improvement. RESULTS 20/21 (95%) of invited centres responded. Over 90% of centres began the transition process below 16 years of age and all had completed transfer to adult care at 18 years of age. The proportion of patients in the transition process at individual centres varied from 10-50%.Joint clinics were held in every centre, with a mean of 12.9 clinics per year. Adult and paediatric gastroenterologists attended at all sites. Availability of additional team members was patchy across the UK, with dietetic, psychological and surgical attendance available in <50% centres. A structured transition tool was used in 75% of centres. Sexual health, contraception and pregnancy were discussed by less than 60% of teams. CONCLUSIONS This study provides real world clinical data on UK-wide transition services. These data can be used to develop a national strategy to complement current transition guidelines, focused on standardising services whilst allowing for local implementation.","Ashton, James J; Narula, Priya; Kiparissi, Fevronia; Spray, Christine; Wilson, David C; Tayler, Rachel; Howarth, Lucy; Torrente, Franco; Deb, Protima; Cameron, Fiona; Muhammed, Rafeeq; Paul, Thankam; Epstein, Jenny; Lawson, Maureen; Maginnis, Janis; Zamvar, Veena; Fagbemi, Andrew; Devadason, David; Bhavsar, Hemant S; Kammermeier, Jochen; Beattie, R Mark",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000003148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853108/,583

Hyperbaric preservation of tissues ex vivo, between harvest and revascularization, may reduce IRI and mitigate acute rejection of VCA. METHODS A porcine heterotopic musculocutaneous gracilis flap model was used. In phase 1, control autografts (n = 5) were infused with University of Wisconsin Solution (UWS) and stored at 4°C for 3 hours. Intervention autografts (n = 5) were placed in a hyperbaric oxygen organ preservation system for 5 hours and infused with hyperoxygenated UWS at 20°C and 3 atm. Grafts were replanted into the animals' necks. In phase 2, similarly treated control (n = 8) and intervention grafts (n = 8) were allotransplanted into the necks of animals separated by a typed and standardized genetic mismatch. No systemic immunosuppression was given. Systemic markers of IRI, and clinical and histopathological assessments of necrosis and rejection were performed. RESULTS Autotransplanted tissue composites preserved in the hyperbaric chamber showed histopathological evidence of less muscle necrosis at 3 hours (p = 0.05). Despite a longer period of ischemia, no evidence was found of a difference in systemic markers of IRI following revascularization in these groups. Allotransplanted tissues supported ex vivo within the hyperbaric perfusion device experienced acute rejection significantly later than corresponding controls. CONCLUSION Hyperbaric warm perfusion preserves musculocutaneous tissue composites ex vivo for longer than standard cold preservation in this model. This translates into a delay in acute rejection of allotransplanted tissue composites.","Fries, Charles Anton; Villamaria, Carole Yasay; Spencer, Jerry Richard; Lawson, Shari; Wang, Lin; Raj, Thomas; Wolf, E George; Parida, Bijaya Kumar; Gorantla, Vijay Saradhi; Rickard, Rory Frederick; Davis, Michael Robert",Journal of reconstructive microsurgery,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1667298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30099732/,583

These children frequently present to the orthoptic clinic with complex difficulties impacting visual functions and eye movements. We report on one case which led to a reevaluation of our current assessment methods, clinical care pathways and the contents of clinic correspondence. We present a case report of a 14-year-old girl who suffered a cardiac arrest due to underlying Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome; MRI revealed hypoxic brain injury with extensive white matter and basal ganglia volume loss. On presentation, it was evident there was a significant impact on visual function. Conventional optotype acuity testing was not possible. Her inability to maintain fixation made observational responses unreliable. Observations revealed no steady fixation, exotropia and roving eye movements. Although she was reported to be unable to speak, progress with communication was reported and she was able to give repeatable, reliable responses to indicate ""yes"" or ""no."" These cues were used and a response of 1.70 cycles per degree was obtained under binocular conditions. This communication method was also utilized to assess visual fields by confrontation. However, the clinic letter written by the ophthalmologist based on the orthoptic assessment simply provided the acuity score with no interpretation of the information or how it was obtained. This case highlighted the importance of understanding a child's communication methods so that assessment can be appropriately adapted. The referral letter was lacking in detail regarding the patient's abilities but equally the ophthalmology letter provided limited detail impacting on the MDT practitioner's ability to understand and apply the information. This case has highlighted the importance of good communication: professionals need to acknowledge and work with an individual's communication methods so that assessment can be completed. Professionals also need to improve communication of relevant findings to others involved in the patient's care.","Fanning, Caroline; O'Connor, Anna",Strabismus,https://doi.org/10.1080/09273972.2021.1914682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33856285/,583

Study Design and Setting We express the robustness of inferences as the amount of data that must be replaced to change the conclusion and relate this to the fragility of trial results used for dichotomous outcomes. We illustrate our approach in the context of an RCT of hydroxychloroquine on pneumonia in COVID-19 patients and a cumulative meta-analysis of the effect of antihypertensive treatments on stroke. Results We developed the Robustness of an Inference to Replacement (RIR), which quantifies how many treatment cases with positive outcomes would have to be replaced with hypothetical patients who did not receive a treatment to change an inference. The RIR addresses known limitations of the Fragility Index by accounting for the observed rates of outcomes. It can be used for varying thresholds for inference, including clinical importance. Conclusion Because the RIR expresses uncertainty in terms of patient experiences, it is more relatable to stakeholders than p-values alone. It helps identify when results are statistically significant, but conclusions are not robust, while considering the rareness of events in the underlying data.","Frank, Kenneth A; Lin, Qinyun; Maroulis, Spiro; Mueller, Anna S; Xu, Ran; Rosenberg, Joshua M; Hayter, Christopher S; Mahmoud, Ramy A; Kolak, Marynia; Dietz, Thomas; Zhang, Lixin",Journal of clinical epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2021.01.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737070/,583

Twelve patients (92.3%) were discharged home, 9 (75%) by day 7 post-CCP. One remained on invasive ventilatory support 42 days after CCP and was eventually discharged to an intermediate care facility. The single patient death was retrospectively confirmed to have had brain death before CCP. CONCLUSION CCP was well tolerated in pediatric patients, resulted in rapid antibody increase, and did not appear to interfere with immune responses measured at 21 days. More pediatric data are necessary to establish the efficacy of CCP, but our data suggest benefit in moderate to severe COVID-19 when used early. Other immunological or antiviral interventions may be added as supported by emerging data.","Arrieta, Antonio; Galvis, Alvaro E; Morphew, Tricia; Ehwerhemuepha, Louis; Osborne, Stephanie; Enriquez, Claudia; Imfeld, Karen; Hoang, Janet; Nieves, Delma; Ashouri, Negar; Singh, Jasjit; Nugent, Diane",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000003166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33967228/,583
149268,Stress and physical inactivity: two explosive ingredients for the heart in COVID-19 pandemic times.,2021-01-25,"Shelter in place mandates due to the COVID-19 pandemic left caregivers to determine how to best meet the therapeutic requirements of their children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Understanding the challenges faced by families, and their experiences using telehealth for the first time, may help make services sustainable in future public health emergencies. A sample of 70 caregivers of people with ASD from across the US completed an anonymous online survey. Results indicate that impaired emotion regulation was a primary contributor of parent-reported stress for persons with ASD during the pandemic, while loss of established structure and routine contributed to parental stress. Nearly half the sample reported using telehealth for the first time. Many caregivers were appreciative that telehealth permitted continuation of services, but expressed concerns about limited effectiveness due in part to their children's social communication problems.","White, Susan W; Stoppelbein, Laura; Scott, Hunter; Spain, Debbie",Research in developmental disabilities,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730684/,583

Some epidemiological evidence has suggested that BCG immunization may have unpredicted effects on resistance to other pathogens. We show here in a mouse model that BCG immunization followed by antibiotic treatment to clear the host of the pathogen rendered three strains of mice partially resistant to infection with vaccinia virus (VV) but not to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). VV-challenged BCG-immune mice developed a striking splenomegaly and elevated CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses by 6 days postinfection (p.i.). However, resistance to VV infection could be seen as early as 1 to 2 days p.i. and was lost after antibody depletion of CD4 T-cell populations. BCG- but not LCMV-immune memory phenotype CD4 T cells preferentially produced gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) in vivo after VV challenge. In contrast, LCMV-immune CD8 T cells preferentially produced IFN-gamma in vivo in response to VV infection. In BCG-immune mice the resistance to VV infection and VV-induced CD4 T-cell IFN-gamma production were ablated by cyclosporine A, which inhibits signaling through the T-cell receptor. This study therefore demonstrates CD4 T-cell-mediated heterologous immunity between a bacterium and virus. Further, it poses the question of whether BCG immunization of humans alters resistance to unrelated pathogens.","Mathurin, Keisha S; Martens, Gregory W; Kornfeld, Hardy; Welsh, Raymond M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02393-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19193795/,583

Thirty percent of natal male PATS identified other than transgender. Some characteristics differed by gender. Most notably, 38% of natal male PATS receiving gender-affirming treatment had waist circumference >102 cm (compared with ≤25% in other groups). Given that PATS is a key population, HIV research should routinely report trial participation and outcomes by gender in addition to natal sex, to provide the results needed to optimize medical care to PATS.","Smeaton, Laura M; Kileel, Emma M; Grinsztejn, Beatriz; Gardner, Edward M; Starr, Kate; Murry, Melissa L; Desvigne-Nickens, Patrice; Alston-Smith, Beverly; Waclawiw, Myron A; Cooper-Arnold, Katharine; Madruga, José V; Sangle, Shashi; Fitch, Kathleen V; Zanni, Markella V; Douglas, Pamela S; Ribaudo, Heather J; Grinspoon, Steven K; Klingman, Karin L",The Journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645160/,583

We conducted a prospective observational study to assess the rate of NIOS failure in subjects treated in the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19. METHODS Patients receiving first-line treatment NIOS for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 in the ICU of a university hospital were included in this study; laboratory data were collected upon arrival, and 28-d outcome was recorded. After propensity score matching based on Simplified Acute Physiology (SAPS) II score, age, PaO2 /FIO2 and PaCO2 at arrival, the NIOS failure rate in subjects with COVID-19 was compared to a previously published cohort who received NIOS during hypoxemic respiratory failure due to other causes. RESULTS A total of 85 subjects received first-line treatment with NIOS. The most frequently used methods were helmet noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula; of these, 52 subjects (61%) required endotracheal intubation. Independent factors associated with NIOS failure were SAPS II score (P = .009) and serum lactate dehydrogenase at enrollment (P = .02); the combination of SAPS II score ≥ 33 with serum lactate dehydrogenase ≥ 405 units/L at ICU admission had 91% specificity in predicting the need for endotracheal intubation. In the propensity-matched cohorts (54 pairs), subjects with COVID-19 showed higher risk of NIOS failure than those with other causes of hypoxemic respiratory failure (59% vs 35%, P = .02), with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2 (95% CI 1.1-3.6, P = .01). CONCLUSIONS As compared to hypoxemic respiratory failure due to other etiologies, subjects with COVID-19 who were treated with NIOS in the ICU were burdened by a 2-fold higher risk of failure. Subjects with a SAPS II score ≥ 33 and serum lactate dehydrogenase ≥ 405 units/L represent the population with the greatest risk.","Menga, Luca Salvatore; Cese, Luca Delle; Bongiovanni, Filippo; Lombardi, Gianmarco; Michi, Teresa; Luciani, Filippo; Cicetti, Marta; Timpano, Jacopo; Ferrante, Maria Cristina; Cesarano, Melania; Anzellotti, Gian Marco; Rosà, Tommaso; Natalini, Daniele; Tanzarella, Eloisa S; Cutuli, Salvatore Lucio; Pintaudi, Gabriele; de Pascale, Gennaro; Dell'Anna, Antonio M; Bello, Giuseppe; Pennisi, Mariano Alberto; Maggiore, Salvatore Maurizio; Maviglia, Riccardo; Grieco, Domenico Luca; Antonelli, Massimo",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.08622; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33653913/,583
151422,Research on COVID-19 and mental health: data mining reveals blind spots.,2020-12-12,"BACKGROUND In children, only a few studies have compared different modes of propofol infusion during a total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil. The aim of this study was to compare Bispectral Index (BIS) profiles (percentage of time spent at adequate BIS values) between four modes of propofol infusion: titration of the infusion rate on clinical signs (TIVA0 ), titration of the infusion rate on the BIS (TIVABIS ), target controlled infusion (TCI) guided by the BIS either with the Kataria model (TCI KBIS ) or the Schnider model (TCI SBIS ). METHODS Sixty-six children (aged from 4 to 14 years) were prospectively randomized into one of the four groups. In the TIVA0 group, the anesthesiologist was blinded to the BIS. In each group, the percentage of time with adequate BIS values (45-55), the bias, and imprecision were calculated. RESULTS The propofol consumption was similar in the four groups. During the maintenance phase, the percentage of time spent in the targeted BIS range was significantly lower in the TIVA0 group compared to the three other groups (TIVA0 : 31% ± 22, TIVABIS : 59% ± 17, TCI KBIS : 53% ± 12, TCI SBIS : 56% ± 17). The bias was not statistically different between the four groups, but the imprecision was larger for the TIVA0 group. Compared to the Kataria model, the Schnider model was associated with shorter time delay to reach the desired BIS, to eyes opening, and to tracheal extubation. CONCLUSIONS Propofol administration using manual infusion guided by clinical signs was associated with higher risks of over- or underdosage when compared to BIS-guided administrations. When propofol infusion was guided by the BIS, no major difference was found between TIVA and TCI (either with the Kataria or the Schnider model). This study highlights the need of a pharmacodynamic feedback during propofol anesthesia in children.","Louvet, Nicolas; Rigouzzo, Agnès; Sabourdin, Nada; Constant, Isabelle",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.12957; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27461767/,583

155338,Toward A universal Electronic Health Record System.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Italy early experienced one of the most suffering impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of number of cases and death toll. Progressively, more compelling national restrictions hardened citizens' lifestyle and habits, including limiting mobility and outdoor physical activity (PA). In a second phase, people were allowed to perform outdoor activities close to their houses and thereafter motor or sports activity were gradually reintroduced. These drastic changes raised the question on how to cope and exploit the residual opportunities of PA under circumstances of home confinement. METHODS International Physical Activity Questionnaires were administered to 1,568 youngsters from North-western Italian high schools, before, during, and after lockdown enacted by Italian Government to contrast the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Student's PA levels were significantly different before (1676.37 ± 20.6 MET-min/week) and after (1774.50 ± 33.93 MET-min/week) the governmental restrictions (TIME effect: F=3.49; ηp 2 = 0.005 p=0.03). There was a significant TIME*CATEGORY interaction effect (F=8.37; ηp 2 = 0.021; p<0.001). In particular, only highly active students (>2520 MET-min/week) increased their PA during (3467.48 ± 55.85 MET-min/week) and after (3515.73 ± 65.75 MET-min/week) the lockdown measures with respect to their baseline levels (3151.43 ± 42.41 MET-min/week). CONCLUSIONS Lockdown measures, including isolation, impacted negatively on the PA levels of the already inactive or moderately active young population.

155621,Working from home and dietary changes during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study of health app (CALO mama) users.,2021-05-15,"BACKGROUND Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a relatively common and potentially life threatening complication after major hip surgery. There are two main types of prophylaxis: chemical and mechanical. Chemical prophylaxis is very effective but causes bleeding complications in surgical wounds and remote organs. On the other hand, mechanical methods are free of hemorrhagic complications but are less effective. We hypothesized that mechanical prophylaxis is effective enough for Asians in whom VTE occurs less frequently. This study evaluated the effect of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) in the prevention of VTE after major hip surgery. METHODS Incidences of symptomatic VTE after primary total hip arthroplasty with and without application of IPC were compared. A total of 379 patients were included in the final analysis. The IPC group included 233 patients (106 men and 127 women) with a mean age of 54 years. The control group included 146 patients (80 men and 66 women) with a mean age of 53 years. All patients took low-dose aspirin for 6 weeks after surgery. IPC was applied to both legs just after surgery and maintained all day until discharge. When a symptom or a sign suspicious of VTE, such as swelling or redness of the foot and ankle, Homans' sign, and dyspnea was detected, computed tomography (CT) angiogram or duplex ultrasonogram was performed. RESULTS Until 3 months after surgery, symptomatic VTE occurred in three patients in the IPC group and in 6 patients in the control group. The incidence of VTE was much lower in the IPC group (1.3%) than in the control group (4.1%), but the difference was not statistically significant. Complications associated with the application of IPC were not detected in any patient. Patients affected by VTE were older and hospitalized longer than the unaffected patients. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that IPC might be an effective and safe method for the prevention of postoperative VTE.","Kwak, Hong Suk; Cho, Jai Ho; Kim, Jung Taek; Yoo, Jeong Joon; Kim, Hee Joong",Clinics in orthopedic surgery,https://doi.org/10.4055/cios.2017.9.1.37; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28261425/,583

In 2017, the Seeley Lake (SL), MT area experienced unprecedented levels of wildfire smoke from July 31 to September 18, with a daily average of 220.9 μg/m3. The aim of this study was to conduct health assessments in the community and evaluate potential adverse health effects. The study resulted in the recruitment of a cohort (n = 95, average age: 63 years), for a rapid response screening activity following the wildland fire event, and two follow-up visits in 2018 and 2019. Analysis of spirometry data found a significant decrease in lung function (FEV1/FVC ratio: forced expiratory volume in first second/forced vital capacity) and a more than doubling of participants that fell below the lower limit of normal (10.2% in 2017 to 45.9% in 2018) one year following the wildfire event, and remained decreased two years (33.9%) post exposure. In addition, observed FEV1 was significantly lower than predicted values. These findings suggest that wildfire smoke can have long-lasting effects on human health. As wildfires continue to increase both here and globally, understanding the health implications is vital to understanding the respiratory impacts of these events as well as developing public health strategies to mitigate the effects.","Orr, Ava; A L Migliaccio, Cristi; Buford, Mary; Ballou, Sarah; Migliaccio, Christopher T",Toxics,https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics8030053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764367/,583

DESIGN Experimental study. ANIMALS Purpose-bred male hound-mix research dogs (n = 8). METHODS Dogs were randomized to groups of left or right-sided laparoscopic surgical approaches. Three transperitoneal portals were established with the dogs in lateral recumbency, and ipsilateral MILN dissection was achieved under CO2 pneumoperitoneum using a vessel-sealing device. RESULTS MILN ipsilateral to the approach were successfully identified and removed laparoscopically in 8 dogs. Observed complications included mild to moderate hemorrhage that was controlled laparoscopically in 4 dogs, and tearing of the MILN capsule during retraction and dissection in 3 dogs. No other major complications occurred and all dogs recovered uneventfully. Areas of either minor peripheral (9/9) or central (4/9) pinch artifact affected a median percentage of 5% of surface area (range, 5-30%) of bisected lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic MILN extirpation is feasible in dogs with normal MILN and may serve as a minimally invasive approach for excisional biopsy in the diagnostic staging of canine onocologic patients with normal-sized MILN. This lateral laparoscopic approach allows dissection of the ipsilateral MILN but precludes removal of the contralateral MILN. Minimal handling of the lymph node during dissection and removal is required to reduce the risk of capsular tear, or introduction of possible histologic artifact by tissue crush that may impact diagnosis.","Steffey, Michele A; Daniel, Leticia; Mayhew, Philipp D; Affolter, Verena K; Soares, Joao H N; Fuller, Mark C",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950x.2014.12207.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24899462/,583

Methods: The data of all the cluster cases of COVID-19 in Tianjin reported as 22 February 2020 were collected to analyze the characteristics of different types of the clusters. Results: A total of 115 COVID-19 cases were reported in in 33 clusters in Tianjin. Clusters can be classified as following: 28 familial clusters (71 cases), 1 work place cluster (10 cases), 3 transport vehicle clusters (8 cases) and 1 public place cluster (26 cases). Fourteen familial clusters were caused by the cases from the working place or public place clusters. Numbers of secondary cases of family clusters were 1-7, the median number was 7.The interval from onset to diagnosis for the first case was longer than those of other cases in the familial clusters (Z=-2.406, P= 0.016). The median of incubation period of the public place clusters was 2 days. The intervals from onset to diagnosis were significant different among the family, working place and public place clusters (H=8.843, , P=0.012) , and there were also significant differences in onset time among the secondary cases (H=16.607, P=0.000) . Conclusions: In the surveillance of COVID-19 epidemic, special attention should be paid to the cases from same family, same work place, or other places where clustering are prone to occur, and the epidemiological investigation should be carried out timely to confirm the cluster. To prevent the transmission of COVID-19, the close contacts of the patients should be transferred to an assigned observation place in time for single room isolation.

We compared antibody responses and seroconversion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients using different immunoassays. Methods We evaluated 12 commercial immunoassays, including three automated chemiluminescent immunoassays (Abbott, Roche, and Siemens), three enzyme immunoassays (Bio-Rad, Euroimmun, and Vircell), five lateral flow immunoassays (Boditech Med, SD biosensor, PCL, Sugentech, and Rapigen), and one surrogate neutralizing antibody assay (GenScript) in sequential samples from 49 COVID-19 patients and 10 seroconversion panels. Results The positive percent agreement (PPA) of assays for a COVID-19 diagnosis ranged from 84.0% to 98.5% for all samples (>14 days after symptom onset), with IgM or IgA assays showing higher PPAs. Seroconversion responses varied across the assay type and disease severity. Assays targeting the spike or receptor-binding domain protein showed a tendency for early seroconversion detection and higher index values in patients with severe disease. Index values from SARS-CoV-2 binding antibody assays (three automated assays, one LFIA, and three EIAs) showed moderate to strong correlations with the neutralizing antibody percentage (r=0.517-0.874), and stronger correlations in patients with severe disease and in assays targeting spike protein. Agreement among the 12 assays was good (74.3%-96.4%) for detecting IgG or total antibodies. Conclusions Positivity rates and seroconversion of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies vary depending on the assay kits, disease severity, and antigen target.

161568,An analysis of mother stress before and during COVID-19 pandemic: The case of China.,2020-12-14,"Although coronaviruses are known to infect various animals by adapting to new hosts, interspecies transmission events are still poorly understood. During a surveillance study from 2005 to 2010, a novel alphacoronavirus, BatCoV HKU10, was detected in two very different bat species, Ro-BatCoV HKU10 in Leschenault's rousettes (Rousettus leschenaulti) (fruit bats in the suborder Megachiroptera) in Guangdong and Hi-BatCoV HKU10 in Pomona leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideros pomona) (insectivorous bats in the suborder Microchiroptera) in Hong Kong. Although infected bats appeared to be healthy, Pomona leaf-nosed bats carrying Hi-BatCoV HKU10 had lower body weights than uninfected bats. To investigate possible interspecies transmission between the two bat species, the complete genomes of two Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and six Hi-BatCoV HKU10 strains were sequenced. Genome and phylogenetic analyses showed that Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and Hi-BatCoV HKU10 represented a novel alphacoronavirus species, sharing highly similar genomes except in the genes encoding spike proteins, which had only 60.5% amino acid identities. Evolution of the spike protein was also rapid in Hi-BatCoV HKU10 strains from 2005 to 2006 but stabilized thereafter. Molecular-clock analysis dated the most recent common ancestor of all BatCoV HKU10 strains to 1959 (highest posterior density regions at 95% [HPDs], 1886 to 2002) and that of Hi-BatCoV HKU10 to 1986 (HPDs, 1956 to 2004). The data suggested recent interspecies transmission from Leschenault's rousettes to Pomona leaf-nosed bats in southern China. Notably, the rapid adaptive genetic change in BatCoV HKU10 spike protein by ~40% amino acid divergence after recent interspecies transmission was even greater than the ~20% amino acid divergence between spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related Rhinolophus bat coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) in bats and civets. This study provided the first evidence for interspecies transmission of coronavirus between bats of different suborders.","Lau, Susanna K P; Li, Kenneth S M; Tsang, Alan K L; Shek, Chung-Tong; Wang, Ming; Choi, Garnet K Y; Guo, Rongtong; Wong, Beatrice H L; Poon, Rosana W S; Lam, Carol S F; Wang, Sylvia Y H; Fan, Rachel Y Y; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Woo, Patrick C Y; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01305-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22933277/,583

However, the interaction of MMPs and TIMPs in tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBL), an extra-pulmonary form of tuberculosis (EPTB) and helminth (Hel+) coinfection is not known. Therefore, this present study investigates the levels of circulating MMPs (1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13) and TIMPs (1, 2, 3, 4) in TBL individuals with helminth (Strongyloides stercoralis [Ss], hereafter Hel+) coinfection and without helminth coinfection (hereafter, Hel-). In addition, we have also carried out the regression analysis and calculated the MMP/TIMP ratios between the two study groups. We describe that the circulating levels of MMPs (except MMP-8 and MMP-12) were elevated in TBL-Hel+ coinfected individuals compared to TBL-Hel- individuals. Similarly, the systemic levels of TIMPs (1, 2, 3, 4) were increased in TBL-Hel+ compared to TBL-Hel- groups indicating that it is a feature of helminth coinfection per se. Finally, our multivariate analysis data also revealed that the changes in MMPs and TIMPs were independent of age, sex, and culture status between TBL-Hel+ and TBL-Hel- individuals. We show that the MMP-2 ratio with all TIMPs were significantly associated with TBL-helminth coinfection. Thus, our results describe how helminth infection has a profound effect on the pathogenesis of TBL and that both MMPs and TIMPs could dampen the immunity against the TBL-Hel+ coinfected individuals.","Kathamuthu, Gokul Raj; Moideen, Kadar; Thiruvengadam, Kannan; Sridhar, Rathinam; Baskaran, Dhanaraj; Babu, Subash",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.680665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350132/,583

The application of gamification has become a priority for marketers as a new way of exploiting customers. Despite the increasing use of gamification mechanisms in marketing activities, there remain limitations. Although there is extensive literature in the field of customer experience and gamification, few studies have empirically examined how gamification influences customer experience by considering the mediating role of brand engagement in the online retailing context.Design/methodology/approachTo obtain this aim, a cross-sectional survey was used. The statistical population was customers of online grocery retailers. The convenience sampling technique was used as a sampling technique. Out of 402 received questionnaires, 384 were selected for analysis. Structural equation modeling approach was applied to test the research hypotheses using AMOS 24 and SPSS 22 software.FindingsThe results indicated that all research hypotheses were supported. Gamification has a significant and positive impact on customer experience, gamification has a positive and significant effect on user customer brand engagement and customer brand engagement has a positive and significant impact on customer experience. Also, it revealed that customer brand engagement mediates between gamification and customer experience.Originality/valueA review of the digital marketing literature reveals that there are few empirical studies, which adequately examined significant effective factors of customer experience in online grocery retailing;despite, the majority of researchers consider customer experience as the most important concept in digital marketing. The main contribution of this study is to examine the role of gamification on customer experience through the mediating role of customer engagement in the online grocery context. It adds value to the digital marketing and online retailing literature by providing new insight about determinants of customer experience in online grocery.","Mona Jami, Pour Rafiei Khadije Khani Monireh Sabrirazm Atena",Nankai Business Review International,https://doi.org/10.1108/nbri-07-2020-0041,583

People susceptible to severe disease, such as people with diabetes, should strictly follow these recommendations. We conducted a survey of Covid-19 avoidance behaviors in individuals with and without type 1 diabetes (T1D). We invited participants with and without T1D who are part of complications research cohorts at the Barbara Davis Center to answer an online survey regarding their exposure to COVID-19 and their behaviors to reduce their risk of infection. A total of 321 participants (162 without diabetes [non-DM], 159 with T1D) completed the initial survey. The average ± SD age was 55±12 years (range 29 to 83 years), and 65% of participants were female. The reported prevalence of an illness like COVID-19 was 20% in adults with T1D and 27% in non-DM adults (p=0.13). Participants with T1D were less likely to report hand washing, avoiding gatherings, canceling travel, wearing a mask, avoiding touching people, wiping down surfaces and following government guidelines (Table). In multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with fewer protective behaviors included younger age, male sex, and T1D (p=0.0005). Despite being at high risk for severe Covid-19 disease, adults with T1D were less likely to report behaviors known to reduce the risk of contracting this illness. These data suggest a need for further education in this high-risk population.","Chartier-Logan, Catherine J.; Eikermann, Emma Wise Haley K.; Malecha, Emily Snell-Bergeon Janet K.",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-1113-p,583

This work intends to discuss the appropriate tools to better manage the pandemic through a critical and inductive observation of the pandemic caused by COVID-19 in Brazil, definition of indicators and protocols and the implementation of a Crisis Committee. In Brazil, this scenario is marked by the denial of the pandemic existence, underreporting and the lack of communication between public governments. This situation shows the unpreparedness of national management to deal with the event, which is reflected in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Then, mechanisms that can prepare managers for the crisis in a dynamic process, in a proactive and preventive manner must be developed, promoting awareness of the barely visible signs that increase the risks of these events and avoiding human errors. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ávila Filho, S.; Ávila, J.

There is a paucity of population-based data on these phenomena for stroke. We examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation and treatment of ischemic stroke in an entire population. Methods: We used linked provincial administrative data and data from the Quality Improvement and Clinical Research Alberta Stroke Program, a registry capturing stroke-related data on the entire population of Alberta(4.3 million), to identify all patients presenting with stroke in the pre-pandemic(1-January-2016 to 27-February-2020, n=19,531) and pandemic(28-February-2020 to 30-August-2020, n=2,255) periods. We examined changes in thrombolysis and endovascular therapy(EVT) rates, workflow, and in-hospital outcomes. Results: Hospitalizations/presentations for ischemic stroke dropped (weekly adjusted-incidence-rate-ratio[aIRR]:0.48, 95%CI:0.46-0.50, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, pre-admission care needs), as did population-level incidence of thrombolysis(aIRR:0.49,0.44-0.56) or EVT(aIRR:0.59,0.49-0.69). However, the proportions of presenting patients receiving acute therapies did not decline (e.g. thrombolysis:11.7% pre-pandemic vs 13.1% during-pandemic, aOR:1.02,0.75-1.38). Onset-to-door times were prolonged; EVT recipients experienced longer door-to-reperfusion times (median door-to-reperfusion:110-minutes, IQR:77-156 pre-pandemic vs 132.5-minutes, 99-179 during-pandemic; adjusted-coefficient:18.7-minutes, 95%CI:1.45-36.0). Hospitalizations were shorter but stroke severity and in-hospital mortality did not differ. Interpretation: The first COVID-19 wave was associated with a halving of presentations and acute therapy utilization for ischemic stroke at a population level, and greater pre-hospital and in-hospital treatment delays. Our data can inform public health messaging and stroke care in current and future waves. Messaging should encourage attendance for emergencies and stroke systems should re-examine code stroke protocols to mitigate inefficiencies.","Ganesh, A.; Stang, J.

It builds a conceptual bridge and discusses the opportunity to capitalise on the missing link between the pre-COVID overtourism and the post-COVID “undertourism” debates. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-fertilisation between the overtourism knowledge and the emerging COVID-19 literature stream is proposed and supported by an online media analysis focussing on the Italian tourism debate on Twitter. A text analysis of 2,500 posts helps discuss the conceptual framework. Findings: The analysed Twitter debate prioritised socio-economic impacts, regulative actions and the recovery approach, representing government as the pivotal actor to overcome the pandemic crisis. An integrative interpretative framework results from this research, opening three areas of inquiry, such as the recovery–reform continuum, managerial approaches beyond regulative frames of action and a critical sizing of digital technologies deployment. Research limitations/implications: Samples with different geographical and temporal coverage may provide further and multifaceted insights into the emerging tourism online media debate.

The impact on global economies has been significant. For example, the Office for National Statistics reported that the UK’s unemployment level increased to 5% and the headline GDP declined by 9.9%, which is more than twice the fall in 2009 due to the financial crisis. It is therefore paramount for governments and policymakers to understand the spread of the disease, patient mortality rates and the impact of their interventions on these two factors. A number of researchers have subsequently applied various state-of-the-art forecasting models, such as long short-term memory models (LSTMs), to the problem of forecasting future numbers of Covid-19 cases (confirmed, deaths) with varying levels of success. In this paper, we present a model from the simple recurrent network class, The Multi-recurrent network (MRN), for predicting the future trend of Covid-19 confirmed and deaths cases in the United States. The MRN is a simple yet powerful alternative to LSTMs, which utilises a unique sluggish state-based memory mechanism. To test this mechanism, we first applied the MRN to predicting monthly Covid-19 cases between Feb 2020 to July 2020, which includes the first peak of the pandemic. The MRN is then applied to predicting cases on a weekly basis from late Feb 2020 to late Dec 2020 which includes two peaks. Our results show that the MRN is able to provide superior predictions to the LSTM with significantly fewer adjustable parameters. We attribute this performance to its robust sluggish state memory, lower model complexity and open up the case for simpler alternative models to the LSTM. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Orojo, O.; Tepper, J.; McGinnity, T.

Since then, a resurgence in pertussis has been observed, which is hypothesized to be linked to waning immunity. To better understand why waning immunity occurs, we developed a long-term outbred CD1 mouse model to conduct the longest murine pertussis vaccine studies to date, spanning out to 532 days post primary immunization. Vaccine-induced memory results from follicular responses and germinal center formation; therefore, cell populations and cytokines involved with memory were measured alongside protection from challenge. Both aP and wP immunization elicit protection from intranasal challenge and generation of pertussis specific antibody responses in mice. Responses to wP vaccination were characterized by a significant increase in T follicular helper cells in the draining lymph nodes and CXCL13 levels in sera compared to aP mice. In addition, a population of B. pertussis+ memory B cells was found to be unique to wP vaccinated mice. This population peaked post-boost, and was measurable out to day 365 post-vaccination. Anti-B. pertussis and anti-pertussis toxoid antibody secreting cells increased one day after boost and remained high at day 532. The data suggest that follicular responses, and in particular CXCL13 levels in sera, should be monitored in pre-clinical and clinical studies for the development of the next-generation pertussis vaccines.","Weaver, Kelly L.; Blackwood, Catherine B.; Horspool, Alexander M.; Pyles, Gage M.; Sen-Kilic, Emel; Grayson, Emily M.; Huckaby, Annalisa B.; Witt, William T.; DeJong, Megan A.; Wolf, M.

COVIDNearTerm is based on an autoregressive model and utilizes a parametric bootstrap approach to make predictions. We evaluated COVIDNearTerm on San Francisco Bay Area hospitalizations and compared it to models from the California COVID Assessment Tool (CalCAT). We found that that COVIDNearTerm predictions were more accurate than the CalCAT ensemble predictions for all comparisons and any CalCAT component for a majority of comparisons. For instance, at the county level our 14-day hospitalization median absolute percentage errors ranged from 16% to 36%. For those same comparisons the CalCAT ensemble errors were between 30% and 59%.

Semi-structured in-depth interviews were initiated to generate data from three motor companies with purposively selected 30 participants. Findings revealed that auto employees who are not electrically inclined are self-encouraged to seek technical and electrical careers to secure a future in the automobile industry. These workers may also pursue careers in computer science. Many autoworkers have supplemented and stabilized their incomes through FOREX and Bitcoin mining trading. Simultaneously, these employees are receptive to changing careers in agriculture. Again, autoworkers prefer self-employment to the job insecurity associated with industrial positions. In general, motivation for upskilling for a future job in the automotive industry is low. Before the Covid-19 crisis, organizations were adopting new ways of doing business that tend to unready workers' readiness. This trend increased very steeply during the pandemic. Retraining and reskilling as steps for workers' readiness to face job automation are not outright answers that will lead to job security.

171713,Rising tide: Responding to the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Objectives: Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody which can prevent infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Due to its high cost, it is recommended for high-risk infants only. We aimed to determine the proportion of infants eligible for palivizumab treatment in England who receive at least one dose. Methods: We used the Hospital Treatment Insights database containing hospital admission records linked to hospital pharmacy dispensing data for 43/153 hospitals in England. Infants born between 2010 and 2016 were considered eligible for palivizumab if their medical records indicated chronic lung disease (CLD), congenital heart disease (CHD), or severe immunodeficiency (SCID), and they met additional criteria based on gestational age at birth and age at start of the RSV season (beginning of October). We calculated the proportion of infants who received at least one dose of palivizumab in their first RSV season, and modelled the odds of treatment according to multiple child characteristics using logistic regression models. Results: We identified 3,712 eligible children, of whom 2,479 (67%) had complete information on all risk factors. Palivizumab was prescribed to 832 of eligible children (34%). Being born at <30 weeks' gestation, aged <6 months at the start of RSV season, and having two or more of CLD, CHD or SCID were associated with higher odds of treatment. Conclusion: In England, palivizumab is not prescribed to the majority of children who are eligible to receive it. Doctors managing these infants might be unfamiliar with the eligibility criteria or are constrained by other considerations, such as cost.","Zylbersztejn, A.; Almossawi, O.; Gudka, N.; Tompsett, D.; De Stavola, B.; Standing, J.

171844,Preparedness for Pediatric COVID-19 Using Systems Approach: Experience of a Health Care Facility from India,2021,"The HIV-1 epidemic originated from a cross-species transmission of a primate lentivirus from chimpanzees to humans near the turn of the 18th century. Simian immunodeficiency viruses have been jumping between old world monkeys in West/Central Africa for thousands of years. So why did HIV-1 only emerge in the past century? This study examined the replicative fitness, transmission, restriction, and cytopathogenicity of 26 primate lentiviruses. Pairwise competitions of these primate lentiviruses revealed that SIVcpz had the highest replicative fitness in human or chimpanzee peripheral blood mononuclear cells, even higher fitness than HIV-1 group M strains responsible for 37 million infections worldwide. In contrast the “HIV-2 lineage” (SIVsmm, SIVmac, SIVagm, and HIV-2) had the lowest replicative fitness. SIVcpz strains were less inhibited by human restriction factors than the “HIV-2 lineage” strains, a restriction that was inversely correlated with replicative fitness. SIVcpz from the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes (Ptt) was slightly more fit in human cells than the strains from Pt schweinfurthii (Pts). However, unlike all other primate lentiviruses (including the HIV-2 lineage), SIVcpz was nonpathogenic in human tonsillar tissue and did not deplete CD4+ T-cells, consistent with the slow or nonpathogenic disease observed in chimpanzees. Despite the close phylogenetic relationship between SIVcpz_Ptt and HIV-1, this epidemic was either caused by cross species transmission of a rare, undiscovered SIVcpz strain of higher virulence or higher virulence differentially evolved among HIV-1 subtypes during the human epidemic. Author summary Invasion of wild animal habitats by humans can have devastating consequences for the human population as evident by the HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. With SARS-CoV-2, a recent zoonotic jump, likely from bats, will help to identify a coronavirus progenitor. In contrast, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) jumped into humans over 100 years ago from a possibly extinct sub-species of chimpanzees and/or extinct lineage of SIV. We examined replicative fitness and pathogenesis of 26 different primate lentiviruses in human and chimpanzee primary lymphoid cells from blood and within tonsils. SIV from a specific chimpanzee species and lowland gorillas were the most capable of infecting and replicating in human and chimp lymphoid cells but they did not result in the pathogenesis related to disease in humans. In contrast, SIV from other old world monkeys were pathogenic but could not replicate efficiently in human cells. We propose the main HIV-1 is derived from a distinct jump of a very rare SIV strain in chimps leading to AIDS pandemic.","Tebit, Denis M.; Nickel, Gabrielle; Gibson, Richard; Carpenter, Crystal; Rodriguez, Myriam; Hathaway, Nicolas J.; Bain, Katie; Reyes-Rodriguez, Angel L.; Bonogo, Jennifer; Canaday, David; McDonald, David; Bailey, Jeffrey A.; Arts, Eric J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.13.337303,583

172151,Effects of the pandemic on the mental health of children and adolescents. review and current scientific evidence of the SARS-COV2 pandemic,2021,"Pathogenic bacteria and viruses in medical environments can lead to treatment complications and hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), and current cleaning protocols do not address hard-to-access areas or that may be beyond line-of-sight treatment such as with ultraviolet radiation. At the time of writing, the ongoing pandemic of the novel coronavirus known as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has claimed over 4 million cases worldwide and is expected to have multiple peaks, with possible resurgences throughout 2020. It is therefore imperative that disinfection methods in the meantime be employed to keep up with the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) and sterilize a wide array of surfaces as quarantine lockdowns begin to be lifted. Here, we tested the efficacy of Sani Sport ozone devices as a means to treat hospital equipment and surfaces for killing bacteria, degrading synthetic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, and RNA from non-replicative capsid enclosed SARS-CoV-2. We observed a rapid killing of medically-relevant and environmental bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtlis, and Deinococcus radiodurans) across four surfaces (blankets, catheter, remotes, and syringes) within 30 minutes, and up to a 99% reduction in viable bacteria at the end of 2-hour treatment cycles. Significant RNA degradation of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA was seen an hour into the ozone treatment as compared to non-treated controls and a non-replicative form of the virus was shown to have significant RNA degradation at 30 minutes compared to a no treatment control and RNA degradation could be reliably detected at 10,000 and 1,000 copies of virus per sample. These results show the strong promise of ozone treatment for reducing risk of infection and HAIs.","Westover, Craig; Rahmatulloev, Savlatjon; Danko, David; Afshinnekoo, Ebrahim; O’Hara, Niamh B.; Ounit, Rachid; Bezdan, Daniela; Mason, Christopher E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/420737,583

The collapse of the global supply chain of PPE has led to a shortage of the PPE. An additive manufacturing process has emerged as one of solutions to overcome such shortage. The objective of this study was to develop a reusable protective face shield using a material extrusion (ME) process. Five types of face shield were designed. Effects of the design on effective stress distribution, deformation, and specific rigidity were investigated through finite element analyses. To examine the influence of the design on deposition and post-processing characteristics, five types of face shield were fabricated from a ME apparatus. Post-processing characteristics and building time were greatly improved when Design 1 was adopted. In addition, the overall weight, wasted material, and buy-to-fly (BTF) ratio were significantly reduced when Design 1 was applied. Finally, results of wearing and droplet spreading experiments showed that the fabricated face shield for Design 1 was applicable to protection of droplet spreading. © 2021 Korean Society for Precision Engineeing.

173312,The COVID-19 pandemic and its psychological impact on tunisian health professionals,2021,"To allow previewing a web page, social media platforms have developed social cards: visualizations consisting of vital information about the underlying resource. At a minimum, social cards often include features such as the web resource's title, text summary, striking image, and domain name. News and scholarly articles on the web are frequently subject to social card creation when being shared on social media. However, we noticed that not all web resources offer sufficient metadata elements to enable appealing social cards. For example, the COVID-19 emergency has made it clear that scholarly articles, in particular, are at an aesthetic disadvantage in social media platforms when compared to their often more flashy disinformation rivals. Also, social cards are often not generated correctly for archived web resources, including pages that lack or predate standards for specifying striking images. With these observations, we are motivated to quantify the levels of inclusion of required metadata in web resources, its evolution over time for archived resources, and create and evaluate an algorithm to automatically select a striking image for social cards. We find that more than 40% of archived news articles sampled from the NEWSROOM dataset and 22% of scholarly articles sampled from the PubMed Central dataset fail to supply striking images. We demonstrate that we can automatically predict the striking image with a Precision@1 of 0.83 for news articles from NEWSROOM and 0.78 for scholarly articles from the open access journal PLOS ONE. © 2021 ACM.","Jones, S.; Weigle, M.; Klein, M.; Nelson, M.

Methods: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study among 817 National Youth Service Corps members. Participants' overall general knowledge about COVID-19 was assessed using nine questions that consisted of general knowledge on the cause, origin, mode of transmission, signs and symptoms, availability of a potent vaccine and specific therapy, prevention strategies of COVID-19 and knowledge of proper handwashing practices. P-values <0.05 were statistically significant. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 24.1±2 years, 317 (41.2%) were males, and 73 (8.9%) had studied a health-related course. Of the 754 respondents who responded to the COVID-19 knowledge questions, 187 (24.8%) had general knowledge about COVID-19, while 280 (37.1%) had knowledge in all domains;mode of spread, symptoms and signs, and prevention of COVID- 19. Among the respondents, 129 (40.7%) males had satisfactory knowledge of COVID-19 (P=0.070), while 38 participants (52.1%) who had studied a health-related course had satisfactory knowledge of COVID-19 (P=0.003). Regarding the knowledge of hand washing, 184 (58%) males displayed satisfactory knowledge (P=0.007). Social media (64.4%) and television (58%) were the main sources of COVID-19 information. Respondents who had studied a health-related course were twice likely to have satisfactory knowledge of COVID-19 (AOR=2, 95% CI=1.25-2.5 P=0.003, ) and six times likely to have satisfactory knowledge of hand washing (AOR=5.6, 95% CI=3.3-10.0, P≤0.0001). Conclusion: Utilization of both social media and the mainstream mass media in disseminating health education information and correcting fake news and misconceptions is needed. Health promotion strategies should be organized for all youths, especially among those who have no previous education in the health and allied courses. © 2021 Shriaz University of Medical Sciences.

Recent studies have revealed that diverse types of assays bear limited predictive power for COVID-19 outcomes. Here, we harness the predictive power of chest CT in combination with plasma cytokines using a machine learning approach for predicting death during hospitalization and maximum severity degree in COVID-19 patients. Patients (n=152) from the Mount Sinai Health System in New York with plasma cytokine assessment and a chest CT within 5 days from admission were included. Demographics, clinical, and laboratory variables, including plasma cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-) were collected from the electronic medical record. We found that chest CT combined with plasma cytokines were good predictors of death (AUC 0.78) and maximum severity (AUC 0.82), whereas CT quantitative was better at predicting severity (AUC 0.81 vs 0.70) while cytokine measurements better predicted death (AUC 0.70 vs 0.66). Finally, we provide a simple scoring system using plasma IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, GGO to aerated lung ratio and age as novel metrics that may be used to monitor patients upon hospitalization and help physicians make critical decisions and considerations for patients at high risk of death for COVID-19.","Carbonell, G.; Del Valle, D.

As a result, the use of M-learning has risen dramatically, which was neither expected or anticipated. The challenges and benefits of such widespread usage are beginning to emerge in front of us. Thus, in this paper, we systematically review the benefits and challenges of leveraging M-learning for Science and Technology courses during the COVID-19 pandemic by educators and learners. Related articles were obtained from various databases, namely, IEEE, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, and Springer. In total, 4210 related articles were initially found. Upon executing careful selection criteria, 22 articles were selected for review. After that, the advantages and threats were identified and discussed. As per our findings, it was determined that M-learning has excellent potential to be an effective platform for education provided that the identified shortcomings are resolved. This review will be helpful for education stakeholders and institutions to gauge the impact of leveraging M-learning as the only means for education to proceed. Moreover, it reveals the strengths and shortcomings that would aid in adjusting the relevant policies administered by the institutions. Furthermore, application developers will be able to comprehend the expected features that should be included in novel M-learning platforms.","Saikat, Shahnawaz Dhillon Jaspaljeet Singh Wan Ahmad Wan Fatimah Jamaluddin Robiatul A’dawiah",Education Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci11090459,583

Cancer-associated immunosuppression may hinder in the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: Data regarding baseline characteristics, COVID-19 and anti-SARS-Cov2 IgG were collected from cancer pts (solid tumors) who tested positive for COVID-19 (PCR+) between March and April 2020 at Catalan Institute of Oncology. We prospectively assessed anti-SARS-Cov2 IgG seroprevalence at 3 and 9 months post infection and explored clinico-pathologic factors associated with IgG positivity. We explored the impact of potential factors influencing antibody production at &gt;9 months. Results: Of 49 pts registered between 10 March-26 April 2020, 21 died &lt;3 months after the infection and 5 pts refused to participate, leaving 23 eligible pts for IgG testing. With respect to those not tested, IgG tested cohort was younger (median age: 64.0 vs 72.9 years, p = 0.001) and presented oncologic remission in 68.2% of cases (vs 34.6%, p = 0.043) at COVID-19 diagnosis. Median time from PCR+ to first and second IgG determination was 3.2 months (Interquartile range [IQR]: 2.9-4.1) and 9.5 months (IQR: 8.8-9.8), respectively. Out of 23 pts, 15 had both determinations and 8 had only one (3 in the first time point, 5 in the second one). We identified 16/18 pts IgG+ (88.9%) at 3 months and 17/20 pts IgG+ (85%) at 9 months. One IgG+ pt became IgG-at the second determination, one was IgG-at both timepoints, and one had an inconclusive result at the first but negative at the second timepoint. Key characteristics of patients by IgG result 9 months after COVID-19 diagnosis are shown in the table. Conclusions: We describe a high seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG at 3 and 9 months after COVID-19 diagnosis in solid tumour patients, irrespective of anti-cancer therapy exposure. Pts who were IgG+ at 9 months were older, and more likely to have required oxygen during prior COVID-19 in comparison to IgG-pts suggesting that infection severity may promote durable immunity. Frequency of early stage cancers was higher among IgG+ pts, suggesting less cancerrelated immunosupression. Older (&gt;70 years) and advanced cancer pts were underrepresented in this series, warranting confirmation of these preliminary results in a larger cohort.","Pous, A.; Felip, E.; Etxaniz, O.; Gonzalez, A.

We hypothesized that high-risk therapies would predispose pts with cancer and COVID-19 to higher risk of VTE complications. Methods: CCC19 is the largest international registry (NCT04354701) recording outcomes of pts with cancer and COVID-19. The registry was queried for hospitalized pts who developed VTE and received systemic cancer treatment in the year prior to COVID-19. Incidence of VTE was analyzed as the primary endpoint;30-day any cause mortality & need for ICU admission at baseline were secondary endpoints in pts with and without VTE respectively. Pts were stratified by treatment type and time from last treatment dose: &lt;2 wk, 2-4 wk, 1-3 months (mos), 3-12 mos. Results: As of February 9th 2021, 4217 hospitalized pts with complications data were present in the registry. 1867 (44%) pts had received systemic anti-cancer therapy within the year prior to COVID-19 and were analyzed. There were a total of 186 (10%) VTE events. Of these, VTE incidence was 141 (10.5%) in pts with solid tumors and 57 (9%) in pts with hematologic malignancies. Overall 30-day mortality was 20% and 22% in pts with and without VTE respectively, while direct admission to ICU at presentation was seen in 17% and 10% of pts with and without VTE, respectively. Treatment timing and drug exposures are below (Table). Receipt of systemic anti-cancer treatment within 3 mos vs 3-12 mos was associated with increased rate of VTE, OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.18-5.84, p=0.011 (univariate Fisher test). Conclusions: We describe the incidence of VTE events in pts with cancer and COVID-19 with recent systemic cancer therapy. ICI and VEGFi were associated with numerically higher rates of VTE;other examined drugs and drug classes were not. Timing of therapy appears to modify risk of VTE. Although retrospective, with possible selection and confounding biases, our analysis suggests that factors other than anticancer drug exposures may drive VTE events in this population.","Gulati, S.; Shah, S.; Kulkarni, A.; Desai, A.; Fu, J.; Zon, R.; Kumar, V.; Hsu, C.

Autori u radu analiziraju prihode (sponzorstva, ulaznice i televizijska prava) i rashode (troškove na ime primanja igrača) nogometnih klubova Prve hrvatske nogometne lige, daju pregled profesionalnog statusa klubova, sportaša i trenera te u završnom dijelu rada analiziraju mjere poduzete od strane Vlade Republike Hrvatske usmjerene na pomoć hrvatskom sportu za vrijeme COVID-19 krize. Upravo je COVID-19 kriza autorima poslužila kao možebitna startna pozicija za bolje reguliranje sporta ubuduće, posebno profesionalnog sporta u Republici Hrvatskoj, koji je značajno doprinio promociji Republike Hrvatske u svijetu.Alternate abstract:The paper aims at analysing Croatian professional sport and the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on it. Football was taken as a model for other team sports because of the share of professional sports clubs in the Republic of Croatia in football. In addition, the legal framework set in football may apply to other sports for successfully developing a similar pattern. The analyses are conducted into the revenues (sponsorships, ticketing and TV rights), and expenses (expenses on behalf of players remuneration) of the football clubs in the First Croatian Football League, providing an overview of the professional status of sports clubs, athletes and coaches. It also encompasses an analysis into measures taken by the Government of the Republic of Croatia to support Croatian sport during the COVID-19 crisis. The COVID-19 crisis has been taken as a possible starting position for better regulation of sports in future, especially as regards the professional sports in the Republic of Croatia contributing significantly to the promotion of the Republic of Croatia worldwide.","Smokvina, Vanja Smokvina Patricia Ribarić",Pravni Vjesnik,https://doi.org/10.25234/pv/12899,583

181060,COVID-19 Outbreak: Impact on Psychological Well-Being of the Health-Care Workers of a Designated COVID-19 Hospital,2021,"PurposeThis paper aims to explore whether India’s export basket in the bilateral intra-industry trade (IIT) with two of its top trading partners characterize robust export earnings or not. This is pertinent for two reasons. First, India has a persistent problem of current account deficit for over decades now. Second, whether India’s export diversification strategy by participating in global value chains to improve export share in the world market led to the problem of the fallacy of composition.Design/methodology/approachThis study considers bilateral trade data between India-USA and India-China at the HS-6 digit level over the period 1990–2018. The magnitude of total IIT is computed using the Grubel and Lloyd (1971) index. This paper then uses the unit value dispersion criterion to disentangle the magnitude of total IIT into horizontal and vertical IIT. Through a stepwise econometric exercise, this paper explores the attributes of exported goods in the IIT basket in terms of the directions of ToT, export share and export-price elasticity.FindingsAcross the two country pairs, the major contributors to the upsurge in IIT are five manufacturing industry groups of chemical, plastics and rubber, textiles, base metals and machinery and mechanical appliances. Across the industry groups, the dominant form of IIT has been low vertical IIT. Most of the industry groups do not characterize robust export earnings as the commodity groups have an elastic demand and an increasing trend of Terms of Trade (ToT). The exceptions are the industry groups of chemicals and textiles in India-China and India-USA, respectively.Research limitations/implicationsThe concern of slim export earnings in most industry groups offers scepticism in maintaining the sustainability of the current account. The problem of the fallacy of composition also cannot be ruled out given the dominance of low vertical IIT. This study argues that these industry groups need to engage in labour market reforms and require access to easy credit to achieve competitiveness in the world market.Originality/valueThe analysis performed in this paper attempts to integrate the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis in the context of IIT. Empirical evidence to such an issue is not profound.","Bagchi, Sagnik Bhattacharyya Surajit",International Journal of Development Issues,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijdi-02-2021-0045,583
181421,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on paramedics’ mental health in Greece,2021,"BackgroundCommunication is key in all aspects of clinical medicine and the doctor’s bleep system is vital in ensuring staff members can communicate with the right people. During the unprecedented times of COVID-19, the medical doctors at Eastbourne District General Hospital (EDGH) commenced a ‘surge rota’ consisting of 4 days on, 4 days off. I aimed to review the bleep system to assess whether ward and medical staff could easily contact the relevant doctor and to introduce and distribute a new ‘bleep system’ which may in turn, enable a safer and smoother running of the hospital.MethodsA cross-sectional study of all doctors on the ‘surge rota’ (April 13, 2020, and May 31, 2020) at EDGH was obtained. The primary outcome measure was their responses to a survey pre- and post-initiation of the ‘bleep system.’ResultsA total of 32 doctors responded to the survey. Following initiation of the ‘bleep system’ the ease of contacting a specific doctor, increased from 18.75% to 93.75%. Similarly, medical staff knowing which bleep to carry (18.75% to 87.5%) and nursing staff knowing who to reliably contact (9.38% to 75%). Doctors also reported being bleeped less often regarding issues not related to them (84.38% to 46.88%) and if they were contacted inappropriately, they knew who to forward the issue on to once the system was in place.ConclusionsThe bleep system is one of the only ways to contact a doctor. Therefore, it is both empirically important and essential for a robust system to be in place which enables both patient safety within the hospital and the smooth running of our NHS service. During COVID times, I implemented a more robust system than its predecessor. Future recommendations should focus on formalising and standardising an effective bleep system throughout EDGH both during the pandemic and beyond.","Donnachie, Douglas",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.64,583
181541,Mental health and personality implications among medical students during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Introduction: Covid-19 related vaccine hesitancy is a major problem worldwide and it risks delaying the global effort to control the pandemic. Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy is also higher in certain communities. Given that prescriber recommendation and community engagement are two effective ways of addressing vaccine hesitancy, training university students to become vaccination champions could be a way of addressing hesitancy, as the champions engage with their communities in their multiple identities. Aim: This study aims to assess the impact of a pilot project conducted in the UCL School of Pharmacy that could pave a way of integrating vaccination championing in the pharmacy undergraduate curriculum to address vaccine hesitancy. Method: Participants completed a pre-workshop questionnaire, attended an online workshop, conducted vaccination-promoting action/s, and provided evidence via a post-workshop questionnaire. Result: Fifty three students completed the course. The students' vaccination-promoting actions ranged from speaking with vaccine-hesitant family, friends and customers in the pharmacy, to posting on various social media platforms. Post-workshop showed an increase in the knowledge of participants regarding vaccination and a decrease in the belief of vaccine misconceptions. After attending the workshop, participants were more likely to engage with vaccine-hesitant friends, family, strangers and patients. They were also more likely to receive the Covid-19 vaccine for them and for their children.","Ali, N.; Ashiru-Oredope, D.; Murdan, S.",Pharmacy Education,https://doi.org/10.46542/pe.2021.211.407419,583

In this study, a highly automatic method that integrates machining status monitoring, on-machine measurement (OMM) inspection, machining error modeling and real time compensation is proposed and developed. The OMM inspection is firstly applied to measure the comprehensive machining errors, the Hampel filtering, the triangulation-based cubic interpolation and a machine learning algorithm are then used to train the machining error model. Finally, the real time compensation of high-density cutting points is realized by developing the compensation system based on External Machine Zero Point Shift (EMZPS) function of machine tool. The proposed method was validated through three sets of compensation experiment of a thin web part. The results revealed that 58.1%, 68.4% and 62.6% of the machining error ranges were decreased, respectively. This method demonstrates immense potential for further applications in efficiency and accuracy improvement of thin-walled freeform surface parts.","Ge, Guangyan; Du, Zhengchun; Yang, Jianguo",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315742; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315742,583

Objective Assessing the BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection given high-risk exposure, through analysis of household members of confirmed cases. Design Retrospective cohort study. Data of household members of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases between 20/12/2020 and 17/03/2021 were collected. Setting Nationally centralized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), the second largest Healthcare Maintenance Organization in Israel. Participants 2.5 million MHS members were considered, of which we included only households with two adult members, given possible lower transmission and susceptibility among children. Households with no prior confirmed infections and a confirmed index case during the study period were included. Exposure Participants were classified into three vaccination groups in time of the index case (the confirmed exposure)- Unvaccinated; Fully Vaccinated(7 or more days post second dose) and a reference control group of Recently Vaccinated Once(0-7 days from the first dose, presumably still unprotected). Main Outcomes and Measures Assessing the probability of an additional SARS-CoV-2 infection in the household occurring within 10 days of an index case, calculated separately for the three vaccination groups. Main outcome was vaccine effectiveness given confirmed exposure. High testing rates among household members enabled us to estimate with a high degree of confidence effectiveness against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection as well. Results A total of 173,569 households were included, out of which 6,351 households had an index infection (mean [SD] age, 58.9 [13.5] years; 50% were women). Vaccine effectiveness of Fully Vaccinated compared to Unvaccinated participants was 80.0% [95% CI, 73.0-85.1] and 82.0% [95% CI, 75.5-86.7] compared to those Recently Vaccinated Once. Conclusion and Relevance The BNT162b2 vaccine is effective in a high-risk, real life, exposure scenario, but the protection rates afforded in these settings are lower than those previously described. Household members of COVID-19 patients and any individual with a confirmed exposure to COVID-19 are still at a considerable risk of being infected even if fully vaccinated.","Gazit, S.; Mizrahi, B.; Kalkstein, N.; Neuberger, A.; Peretz, A.; Mizrahi-Reuveni, M.; Patalon, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.29.21259579v1?rss=1,583

Identified in China in December 2019, the virus has spread more than 200 countries in the world. Scientists have named the virus as Novel Corona Virus (belongs to SARS group virus). The virus has caused severe disruption to our world. Educational institutions, financial Services, government services and many other sectors are badly affected by this virus. More importantly, the virus has caused a massive amount of human deaths around the world and still its infecting people every day. Scientist around the world are trying to find a solution to stop the COVID-19. Their solutions include identifying possible effective vaccine, computer-aided modelling to see the pattern of spread etc. Using Machine Learning techniques, it is possible to forecast the spread, death, and recovery due to COVID-19. In this article, we have shown a machine learning model named as Prophet Time Series Analysis to forecast the spread, death, and recovery in different countries. We train the model using the available historical data on COVID-19 from John Hopkins University's COVID-19 site. Then we forecast spread, death, and recovery for seven days using a well known forecasting model called Prophet. This interval can be increased to see the effect of COVID-19. We chose 145 days of historical data to train the model then we predict effect for seven days (15 June 2020 to 22 June 2020). To verify out result, we compare the predicted value with actual value of spread, death and recovery. The model provides accuracy over 92% in all the cases. Our model can be used to identify the effect of COVID-19 in any countries in the world. The system is developed using Python language and visualization is also possible interactively. By using our system, it will be possible to observe the effect of spread, death and recovery for any countries for any period of time. © 2021 AIUB Office of Research and Publication.

183908,Emergency Planning in Ontario's Acute Care Hospitals: A Survey of Board Chairs.,2008,"The aim of this article is: (a) to argue that the UK governments’ authoritarian response to the COVID‐19 pandemic is inciting a qualitative shift in discourse structures that are transforming xenophobia into a radically totalitarian force;and (b) to demonstrate that even ostensibly voluntarist libertarian discourse also creates conditions for the psyche that incite the same totalitarian xenophobic transformation. I use two approaches to the relation between authoritarianism and xenophobia in the context of the COVID‐19 pandemic in the UK and the debates over the benefits and harms of ‘lockdowns’ (state‐enforced, legally binding restrictions on social interaction to reduce infection transmission). First, I use Lacanian theory in a socio‐cultural critique to explain the on‐going shift, during the pandemic, towards an increasingly totalitarian psyche, that is intensifying and transforming xenophobia. The anti‐democratic imposition of new laws induces agencies and civilians to over‐zealously report and punish violators. I present xenophobic activities that are signs of a developing totalitarian psyche that over‐represses and ultimately negates the humanity of the other and feels a duty to punish the ‘other’ as a moral good. Second, I use Lacanian discourse analysis to analyse an example of ostensibly libertarian anti‐lockdown discourse. The analysis disorganises and disentangles the underlying non‐sensical symbolic values and structure of words or signifiers. This reveals how these signifiers: (a) create discrete identities for social groups of ‘minority’ non‐sensible others;who are (b) blamed as the cause of harm to the sensible ‘majority’;and (c) function socially to effectively demand that the ‘minority’ groups isolate themselves, as if voluntarily, and are to be isolated, actually and metaphorically, by the xenophobic ‘majority’. The apparently liberal democratic discourse is shown to be performative of a totalitarian system of mastery and xenophobic attitudes and behaviours.

185878,Intimate Partner Violence During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-01-01,"The COVID-19 pandemic brought an education crisis that forced schools to abruptly shift to online distance learning. Regardless of the challenges in this migration, the teaching?learning process should continue. Self-regulated learning skills are essential in learning in an online environment;hence, the study aims to explore learners? perception in an online learning environment, self-regulated learning skills, and academic achievement during a research methods course. Perception on the online learning environment, self-regulated learning skills, and academic achievement were collected periodically throughout the online course. The analysis included repeated measures of ANOVA to examine the trends between periods of measurement. A linear regression analysis was used to determine the impact of perception on the online learning environment to self-regulated learning. Results of repeated measures of ANOVA suggest a subtle decrease in the perception of the online learning environment at the start of the course. Still, ratings consistently increased viewing online distance learning the same with pre-quarantine set-up. On the other hand, self-regulated learning remained virtually the same throughout the implementation of research methods online course. A rise in the learning playlist scores has been observed at the start of the research methods course, but scores began to decline at the latter phases of the course. Results of regression analysis imply the influence of perception on the online learning environment on self-regulated learning skills. However, perception does not affect learners? academic achievement. The study recommends using strategies to further develop perseverance in adjusting to online learning amid initial setbacks. Also, interventions specific to improving learners? self-regulated learning skills are highly recommended.","Calamlam, Jose Mari Ferran Fritz Macabali Lee Gerard",E-Learning and Digital Media,https://doi.org/10.1177/20427530211027722,583

METHODS Cases included 19 subjects with Hashimoto disease in euthyroid phase, 19 subjects with euthyroid goitre, 2 control groups each of 76 subjects matched (4/1) according to age and sex drawn from the data base of a community based sample. Psychiatric diagnoses were formulated using the International Composite Diagnostic Interview Simplified, according to DSM-IV criteria. All subjects underwent a complete thyroid evaluation including physical examination, thyroid echography and measure of serum free T4 (FT4), free T3 (FT3), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and anti-thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (anti-TPO). RESULTS Subjects with Hashimoto disease showed higher frequencies of lifetime Depressive Episode (OR = 6.6, C.L. 95% 1.2-25.7), Generalized Anxiety Disorders (OR = 4,9 Cl 95% 1.5-25.4) and Social Phobia (OR = 20.0, CL 95% 2.3-153.3) whilst no differences were found between subjects with goitre and controls. CONCLUSION The study seems to confirm that risk for depressive disorders in subjects with thyroiditis is independent of the thyroid function detected by routine tests and indicates that not only mood but also anxiety disorders may be associated with Hashimoto disease.","Carta, Mauro Giovanni; Hardoy, Maria Carolina; Carpiniello, Bernardo; Murru, Andrea; Marci, Anna Rita; Carbone, Fiora; Deiana, Luca; Cadeddu, Mariangela; Mariotti, Stefano",Clinical practice and epidemiology in mental health : CP & EMH,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16285879/,583

As a state, Ohio tends to be demographically representative of the broader US population. OBJECTIVE Reviewing the efforts deployed by Ohio to flatten the COVID-19 infection curve and reduce the spread of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an important component of determining optimal procedures for mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Over the course of several announcements and orders during the months of March and April, new policies were put into place to prevent COVID-19 transmission, which included efforts to facilitate social distancing and ensure the health care system could manage the number of COVID-19 cases at peak infection rate. Efforts directed toward medical providers included delay of elective procedures, expansion of telehealth options, and new temporary guidance for prescribing controlled substances. RESULTS The Ohio COVID-19 containment approach resulted in a substantial reduction in COVID-19 cases compared with early models of disease spread, and the state has begun a phased reopening. Continued vigilance in applying social distancing and infection control measures will be a critical component of preventing or reducing the impact of a second wave of COVID-19 in Ohio.

METHODS Pulmonary function tests were performed in 25 convalescent patients who had a diagnosis of SARS in 2003. Total lung volume, residual capacity, vital capacity, forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1, FEV1/FVC and lung carbon monoxide diffusion (DLCO) were measured, and compared with the values obtained immediately after recovery in 2003. Of the 25 cases, 3 were males and 22 were females, aging 31-69 years [average (45.8 ± 12.2)]. Twenty-five healthy adults (6 males, 19 females), aged 31-62 years [average (42.3 ± 11.9) years], were recruited as controls. RESULTS Of the 25 cases, 2 showed simple diffusion dysfunction, 2 simple restrictive ventilatory dysfunction, 11 combined diffusion and restrictive ventilatory dysfunction, and 1 combined diffusion and obstructive ventilatory dysfunction. The remaining 10 cases showed normal lung function. There were no statistical differences in the pulmonary function measurements as compared with those measured 10 years ago, including DLCO (73 ± 12)% vs (72 ± 15)% (P>0.05), FEV1/FVC (83 ± 11)% vs (85 ± 7)%, (P>0.05), FEV1 (88 ± 7)% vs (86 ± 14)% (P>0.05), FVC (87 ± 21)% vs (87 ± 17)% (P>0.05), and RV (100 ± 17)% vs (78 ± 3 0)% (P>0.05). The lung functions of the patients showed no significant difference as compared with those obtained from the healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS The pulmonary functions of SARS patents largely returned to normal after 10 years of convalescence, and the lung function damage was characterized by diffusing and restrictive ventilatory dysfunctions.","Li, Li; Sun, Xin; Wu, Qi; Wu, Qian; Xing, Zhihang; Yu, Hongzhi",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26703338/,583

202508,Need to understand challenges at rural dental health centers among developing countries in COVID-19 context,2021,"Background: Physical activity (PA) is known to be a protective lifestyle factor against several non-communicable diseases while its impact on infectious diseases, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not as clear. Methods: We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify associations between both objectively and subjectively measured PA collected prospectively and COVID-19 related outcomes (overall COVID-19, inpatient COVID-19, outpatient COVID-19, and COVID-19 death) in the UK Biobank cohort. Subsequently, we tested causality by using Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses. Results: In the multivariable model, the increased acceleration vector magnitude PA (AMPA) is associated with a decreased probability of overall and outpatient COVID-19 with an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.80 (0.69, 0.93) and 0.74 (0.58, 0.95), respectively. No association is found between self-reported moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and COVID-19 related outcomes. No association is found by MR analyses. Conclusions: Our results indicate a protective effect of objectively measured PA and COVID-19 outcomes (outpatient COVID-19 and overall COVID-19) independent of age, sex, measures of obesity, and smoking status. Although the MR analyses do not support a causal association, that may be due to limited power. We conclude that policies to encourage and facilitate exercise at a population level during the pandemic should be considered.","Zhang, Xiaomeng; Li, Xue; Sun, Ziwen; He, Yazhou; Xu, Wei; Campbell, Harry; Dunlop, Malcolm G; Timofeeva, Maria; Theodoratou, Evropi",J Glob Health,,583

The disruption caused by COVID-19 presents unexpected challenges in fostering the development of skill sets among social work educators in partnership with students. This article is a reflexive collaborative autoethnography written by four educators of different international and cultural backgrounds at a regional university in Queensland. Our university has experienced a shift from primarily a face-to-face delivery to online delivery due to social distancing. This article is grounded in an ethic of love, a values-based relationship-oriented practice promoting care, collaborative dialogue and solidarity between people, using self-compassion and reflexivity. We explore how COVID-19 has forced the authors to alter their teaching practice, cope with uncertainties, and respond with loving kindness to the shifting needs of students. We draw upon our experiences as educators of diverse cultural, linguistic, gender, and sexualities from Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Nigeria and reflect upon how we have simultaneously turned inward and outward through technology. We draw upon person-centered, narrative, trauma informed and anti-oppressive clinical and educational approaches when exploring self-compassion and loving approaches with the students. We discuss the need for self-compassion and love of others as we respond to the current crisis by modeling self-compassion and love for CSW students who are experiencing crises, including loss of employment, separation from family overseas and interstate, isolation from colleagues and loved ones, and healthcare issues.","Gates, Trevor G; Ross, Dyann; Bennett, Bindi; Jonathan, Kate",Clin Soc Work J,,583

Analyses reveal the South Korean boyband BTS as the most significant driver of health discourse. Tweets from health agencies and prominent figures that mentioned K-pop generate 111 times more of online response compared to tweets that did not. These tweets also elicited a strong responses from South America, Southeast Asia, and rural States -- areas often neglected in Twitter-based messaging by mainstream social media campaigns.

Hospitals were flooded by thousands of patients with bilateral pneumonia and severe respiratory, and vital sign derangements compared to the standard hospital population. We propose a new visual analysis technique using heat maps to describe the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on vital sign anomalies in hospitalized patients. We conducted an electronic health record study, including all confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized from February 21st, 2020 to April 21st, 2020 as cases, and all non-COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the same wards from January 1st, 2018 to December 31st, 2018. All data on temperature, peripheral oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were retrieved. Derangement of vital signs was defined according to predefined thresholds. 470 COVID-19 patients and 9241 controls were included. Cases were older than controls, with a median age of 79 vs 76 years in non survivors (p = < 0.002). Gender was not associated with mortality. Overall mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized patients was 18%, ranging from 1.4% in patients below 65 years to about 30% in patients over 65 years. Heat maps analysis demonstrated that COVID-19 patients had an increased frequency in episodes of compromised respiratory rate, acute desaturation, and fever. COVID-19 epidemic profoundly affected the incidence of severe derangements in vital signs in a large academic hospital. We validated heat maps as a method to analyze the clinical stability of hospitalized patients. This method may help to improve resource allocation according to patient characteristics.","Caruso, Pier Francesco; Angelotti, Giovanni; Greco, Massimiliano; Albini, Marco; Savevski, Victor; Azzolini, Elena; Briani, Martina; Ciccarelli, Michele; Aghemo, Alessio; Kurihara, Hayato; Voza, Antonio; Badalamenti, Salvatore; Lagioia, Michele; Cecconi, Maurizio",J. clin. monit. comput,,583

However, to date, no research has demonstrated the capacity for these digital biomarkers to predict long-term prognosis. METHODS: We utilized deep learning models based on wearable sensor technology to predict long-term (17-18-year) deterioration in generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder symptoms from actigraphy data on daytime movement and nighttime sleeping patterns. As part of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS), a national longitudinal study of health and well-being, subjects (N = 265) (i) completed a phone-based interview that assessed generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder symptoms at enrollment, (ii) participated in a one-week actigraphy study 9-14 years later, and (iii) completed a long-term follow-up, phone-based interview to quantify generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder symptoms 17-18 years from initial enrollment. A deep auto-encoder paired with a multi-layered ensemble deep learning model was leveraged to predict whether participants experienced increased anxiety disorder symptoms across this 17-18 year period. RESULTS: Out-of-sample cross-validated results suggested that wearable movement data could significantly predict which individuals would experience symptom deterioration (AUC = 0.696, CI [0.598, 0.793], 84.6% sensitivity, 52.7% specificity, balanced accuracy = 68.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Passive wearable actigraphy data could be utilized to predict long-term deterioration of anxiety disorder symptoms. Future studies should examine whether these methods could be implemented to prevent deterioration of anxiety disorder symptoms.","Jacobson, Nicholas C; Lekkas, Damien; Huang, Raphael; Thomas, Natalie",J Affect Disord,,583

Patients were divided into two groups based on the outcome: low risk (hospitalization in the infectious disease ward and discharge) and high risk (hospitalization in ICU or death). A total of 164 patients with positive PCR-RT were enrolled in this study. About 36 patients (22%) were in the high-risk group and 128 (78%) were in the low-risk group. Results of statistical analysis revealed a significant relationship between age, fatigue, history of cerebrovascular disease, organ failure, white blood cells (WBC), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) with increased risk of disease. The artificial neural network (ANN) could predict the high-risk group with an accuracy of 87.2%. Preliminary findings of COVID-19 patients can be used in predicting their outcome and ANN can determine the outcome of patients with appropriate accuracy (87.2%). Most treatment in Covid-19 are supportive and depend on the severity of the disease and its complications. The first step in treatment is to determine the severity of the disease. This study can improve the treatment of patients by predicting the severity of the disease using the initial finding of patients and improve the management of disease with differentiating high-risk from low-risk groups.","Khayat Kashani, Hamid Reza; Hajijafari, Mohamad; Khayat Kashani, Fereshte; Salimi, Sohrab",Dermatol Ther,,583

212754,"Impact of anxiety, stress, and burnout symptoms in Brazilian health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"INTRODUCTION: At the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, controversial data were reported concerning angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) that induced a number of physicians to stop using them in patients with COVID-19. Although large-scale studies have ruled out this concern, it is common experience that patients with COVID-19 taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs are at increased risk of death. The aim of this study was to investigate the reasons for this apparently high mortality rate. METHODS: During the first wave of the pandemic, we conducted a field study of 427 consecutive patients with COVID-19 upon their admission to the emergency department of a hospital in one of the most severely hit cities in northern Italy, and 30 days later. The disease was defined as being mild, moderate or severe on the basis of clinical, laboratory and imaging data, and a multivariate model was used to analyse the determinants of mortality. RESULTS: Within 30 days of admission, 31.6% of the patients treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs and 15.2% of those not treated with these drugs had died. Multivariate analysis showed that the determinants of mortality were age (p = 0.0001), hypertension (p = 0.0120) and diabetes (p = 0.0129), whereas ACE inhibitors or ARBs had no effect on mortality. There was no significant difference between the patients treated with ACE inhibitors and those treated with ARBs. CONCLUSION: The apparently increased mortality of patients with COVID-19 receiving long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs is not due to the drugs themselves, but to the conditions associated with their use.","Cugno, Massimo; Gualtierotti, Roberta; Casazza, Giovanni; Tafuri, Francesco; Ghigliazza, Gabriele; Torri, Adriana; Costantino, Giorgio; Montano, Nicola; Peyvandi, Flora",Adv Ther,,583

METHODS: The semester-long pipeline program, Saturday Academy at New York University College of Dentistry, was conducted remotely through Zoom, and materials for hands-on, pre-clinical activities, were mailed to participants. Saturday Academy aims to educate underrepresented minority and low-income high school students about the college application process and the dental profession. After the program's completion, program applications and engagement data were analyzed. An anonymous online survey was administered to the high school student participants. The survey questions included topics about their interest in the profession of dentistry, satisfaction with the Saturday Academy programming, and program engagement. RESULTS: In its remote format, Saturday Academy had an average attendance of 87.8% at each session. All (60/60, 100%) of the high school student participants responded to the anonymous program satisfaction survey. Sixty-seven percent reported an interest in the profession of dentistry before participating in the program and 82% after participating in the program. Ninety-eight percent agreed with the statement ""I enjoyed my experience participating in Saturday Academy."" Additionally, 97% agreed with the statement ""Saturday Academy's virtual programming was effective."" There were no statistically significant differences in program satisfaction when data from the virtual program were compared to 2 years of in-person program satisfaction data.

Due to the high rate of transmission and mortality, finding specific and effective treatment options for this infection is currently of urgent importance. Emerging technologies have created a promising platform for developing novel treatment options for various viral diseases such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here, we have described potential novel therapeutic options based on the structure and pathophysiological mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as the results of previous studies on similar viruses such as SARS and MERS. Many of these approaches can be used for controlling viral infection by reducing the viral damage or by increasing the potency of the host response. Owing to their high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility, siRNAs, aptamers, nanobodies, neutralizing antibodies, and different types of peptides can be used for interference with viral replication or for blocking internalization. Receptor agonists and interferon-inducing agents are also potential options to balance and enhance the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Solid evidence on the efficacy and safety of such novel technologies is yet to be established although many well-designed clinical trials are underway to address these issues.","Aghamollaei, Hossein; Sarvestani, Rahim; Bakherad, Hamid; Zare, Hamed; Guest, Paul C; Ranjbar, Reza; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Adv Exp Med Biol,,583

Polymorphisms in the population play a role in susceptibility to severity. We aimed to perform a systematic review related to the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Twenty-eight eligible articles published were identified in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, PMC Central and Portal BVS and additional records, with 20 studies performed in China. Information on study characteristics, genetic polymorphisms, and comorbidities was extracted. Study quality was assessed by the STrengthening the REporting of Genetic Association (STREGA) guideline. Few studies investigated the presence of polymorphisms in HLA, ACE1, OAS-1, MxA, PKR, MBL, E-CR1, FcÎ³RIIA, MBL2, L-SIGN (CLEC4M), IFNG, CD14, ICAM3, RANTES, IL-12 RB1, TNFA, CXCL10/IP-10, CD209 (DC-SIGN), AHSG, CYP4F3 and CCL2 with the susceptibility or protection to SARS-Cov. This review provides comprehensive evidence of the association between genetic polymorphisms and susceptibility or protection to severity SARS-CoV. The literature about coronavirus infection, susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and genetic variations is scarce.

Human CoVs (HCoVs) have long been known to be the causative agents of mild respiratory illnesses. However, two HCoVs associated with severe respiratory diseases are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV). Both viruses resulted in hundreds of deaths after spreading to several countries. Most recently, SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as the third HCoV causing severe respiratory distress syndrome and viral pneumonia (known as COVID-19) in patients from Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Soon after its discovery, SARS-CoV-2 spread to all countries, resulting in millions of cases and thousands of deaths. Since the emergence of SARS-CoV, many research groups have dedicated their resources to discovering effective antivirals that can treat such life-threatening infections. The rapid spread and high fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 necessitate the quick discovery of effective antivirals to control this outbreak. Since SARS-CoV-2 shares 79% sequence identity with SARS-CoV, several anti-SARS-CoV drugs have shown promise in limiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we discuss antivirals described for SARS-CoV and provide an update on therapeutic strategies and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. The control of the current outbreak will strongly depend on the discovery of effective and safe anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.","Elshabrawy, Hatem A.",Vaccines,,583

The aim of this paper is to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hip and knee arthroplasties in an Italian high-volume orthopedic center, located in the region of the country first and worst affected by the Coronavirus. METHODS: Data from an institutional database were retrospectively analyzed to obtain the number of hip and knee arthroplasties performed from February 24 to April 10 2020. The figures were compared with those of the same 7-week period of the last year (2019). RESULTS: The number of hip and knee arthroplasties showed a decrease from 706 in the same period of 2019 to 166 (76.5% less) in the current year. In 2019, a mean of 101 ± 9 hip and knee arthroplasties were performed per week compared with a mean of 24 ± 34 in 2020. Ten patients tested positive for SARS-CoV2 during their hospital stay. Two of these patients died after a regular postoperative period after developing unexpectedly COVID-19 during rehabilitation. The mortality in the 7-week period of the current year was 1.2% compared with 0% in 2019. CONCLUSION: The outbreak of COVID-19 had a considerable effect in our center on the number of hip and knee arthroplasties that rapidly decreased to 0 in parallel to the worsening of the situation in the country. Efforts will be soon requested because our practice is going to deal with the after-effects of the pandemic in the near future.","D039,; Apolito, Rocco; Faraldi, Martina; Ottaiano, Immacolata; Zagra, Luigi",J Arthroplasty,,583

Clinical trials have focused largely on direct antiviral therapies or on immunomodulation in patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19. One therapeutic approach that remains to be clinically investigated is disruption of the host-virus relationship through amino acid restriction, a strategy used successfully in the setting of cancer treatment. Arginine is an amino acid that has been shown in nonclinical studies to be essential in the life cycle of many viruses. Therefore, arginine depletion may be an effective therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2. Several arginine-metabolizing enzymes in clinical development may be a viable approach to induce a low arginine environment to treat COVID-19 and other viral diseases. Herein, we explore the rationale for arginine depletion as a therapeutic approach for COVID-19.","Grimes, Joseph M; Khan, Shaheer; Badeaux, Mark; Rao, Ravi M; Rowlinson, Scott W; Carvajal, Richard D",Int J Infect Dis,,583

Scientists and research staff were required to continue their work remotely with little time to prepare for the transition. This survey study used an explanatory sequential mixed method design to explore clinical and translational researcher and staff experiences of the transition to remote work during the first six weeks of the pandemic. Participants indicated the level of interference with their research and shared their experiences of remote work, how they were impacted, how they were adapting and coping, and any short or long-term concerns. Most participants indicated that remote work interfered with their research to a moderate or great degree. Participant stories illuminated the differences of remote work prior to and during COVID-19. They described both challenges and silver linings. Here we describe three themes that highlight the challenges of transitioning to remote work during a pandemic: 1) Leadership: ""This is an opportunity for leadership to lead, but leadership has disappeared"";2) Parenting: Parents are ""multitasked to death"" every day ;and 3) Mental health: The COVID-19 experience is ""psychologically taxing"";The study findings can be used to assist academic, hospital, department, and team leaders in building community, resiliency, and support productivity during current and future crises.","Leonard, C.; Connelly, B.; Albright, K.; Gilmartin, H.",,,583

Forty-nine participants were recruited from a group of 99 adults repatriated from a cruise ship with a high incidence of COVID-19. Respiratory and rectal swabs were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Sera were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and microneutralisation assay. Symptoms, viral shedding and antibody response were examined. Forty-five participants (92%) were considered cases based on either positive PCR or positive ELISA for immunoglobulin G. Forty-two percent of cases were asymptomatic. Only 15% of symptomatic cases reported fever. Serial respiratory and rectal swabs were positive for 10% and 5% of participants respectively about 3 weeks after median symptom onset. Cycle threshold values were high (range 31-45). Attempts to isolate live virus were unsuccessful. The presence of symptoms was not associated with demographics, comorbidities or antibody response. In closed settings, incidence of COVID-19 could be almost double that suggested by symptom-based screening.

222710,Post COVID-19 lockdown: measures and practices for dental institutes,2020,"Introduction Lors de la première vague de l’épidémie de COVID-19, la réduction d’activité des établissements de santé (ES), notamment en chirurgie, a pu entraîner un moindre recours aux antibiotiques. Toutefois, l’accueil de nombreux patients atteints de COVID-19 a engendré la prescription de traitements antibiotiques visant à prévenir ou traiter des (suspicions de) surinfections bactériennes. Les consommations d’antibiotiques au premier trimestre 2020 (début de première vague) ont été comparées à celles du deuxième trimestre (pic de la première vague) afin d’estimer l’impact de l’épidémie sur l’utilisation d’antibiotiques. Matériels et méthodes Les consommations d’antibiotiques à visée systémique dispensés dans les services d’hospitalisation complète ont été recueillies pour la période du 1er janvier au 31 mars 2020 (T1) puis du 1er avril au 30 juin 2020 (T2), dans des ES volontaires participant à la surveillance nationale SPARES, et ayant indiqué avoir accueilli ou non des patients COVID-19. Elles ont été exprimées en nombre de doses définies journalières (DDJ) pour 1000 journées d’hospitalisation (JH) et comparées entre T1 et T2 dans les secteurs d’activité clinique de réanimation, médecine et soins de suite et réadaptation (SSR) (test de Wilcoxon des rangs signés). Résultats Dans les 118 ES ayant accueilli des patients COVID-19 (C+) en T1 et T2 et les 75 ES n’en ayant pas accueilli (C−), l’activité en nombre de JH avait diminué de 14 % et 13 % respectivement. La consommation globale d’antibiotique était plus faible en T2 par rapport à T1 dans 35 secteurs de réanimation C+ (−19 %), 72 secteurs de médecine C+ (−9 %) et 25 secteurs de médecine C− (−19 %), ainsi que dans 37 SSR C− (−14 %). En réanimation, les consommations d’azithromycine, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime et amoxicilline–acide clavulanique étaient significativement plus faibles en T2 et celle de ceftazidime significativement plus élevée. La consommation d’antibiotiques était plus élevée en T2 dans 43 secteurs de SSR C+ (+6 %), avec une consommation de ceftriaxone significativement plus élevée. Conclusion Globalement, la pression de sélection antibiotique semble avoir été plus faible en T2 dans les ES volontaires ayant fourni des données de consommation par secteur d’activité clinique, qu’ils aient accueilli ou non des patients COVID-19. Cette tendance peut être liée à la réduction d’activité liée, d’une part, aux déprogrammations, et d’autre part, au confinement qui a réduit le nombre d’infections nécessitant potentiellement une hospitalisation. De plus, la mobilisation des comités anti-infectieux a pu conduire à la diffusion de recommandations de bon usage des antibiotiques pour les patients COVID-19 avant même la parution de l’avis du HCSP en juin. Toutefois, s’agissant de données agrégées de dispensation et non de données individuelles d’administration, un effet stockage en T1 ne peut être écarté. L’effet à moyen terme sur les résistances bactériennes reste à évaluer.","Jouzeau, A.; Chabaud, A.; Péfau, M.; Dugravot, L.; Lieutier-Colas, F.; Simon, L.; Dumartin, C.",Infectious Diseases Now,,583

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Medicine, Combined Military Hospital, Peshawar Cantt; Pakistan from March to June 2020. METHODOLOGY: Admitted patients with SARS-CoV-2 detectable by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were included. Patients with suggestive radiological findings but negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2, those with incomplete data or those leaving against medical advice were excluded. Serum C-reactive protein, ferritin and LDH levels were tested on admission. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was checked on nasopharyngeal samples. Disease severity was assessed using World Health Organization guidelines. RESULTS: There were 238 patients, aged 41.18 ± 16.74 years. Disease was mild in 157 (65.97%), moderate in 36 (15.13%), and severe in 45 (18.91%) cases. Twenty-two (9.24%) patients died in the hospital. Serum C-reactive protein, ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase levels were elevated in 122 (51.26%), 83 (34.87%) and 184 (77.31%) patients, respectively; more frequently amongst patients with moderate/severe disease or mortality. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves and 95% confidence intervals for serum C-reactive protein, ferritin and LDH were 0.909 (0.854-0.964), 0.915 (0.835-0.995) and 0.863 (0.785-0.942), respectively.

226768,A Developmental Pathway From Early Behavioral Inhibition to Young Adults' Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"This study investigated the effect of wind speed and air pollution on COVID-19 from March 10, 2020, to October 04, 2020, in Pakistan. Wind speed and COVID-19 had positive correlation in Pakistan and its provinces. The inverted U-shaped dose-response curve was found for wind speed and COVID-19 in Punjab. Initially, the dose-response curve showed a positive link between wind speed and COVID-19 in Pakistan, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad Capital Territory. Later, it becomes downward sloped in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad Capital Territory. The expected log count of COVID-19 was increased by 0.113 times (Pakistan), 0.074 times (Punjab), 0.042 times (Sindh), and 0.082 times (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) for a 1 km/h increase in the wind speed. The correlation between particulate matter and COVID-19 was positive (Pakistan, Punjab, and Islamabad Capital Territory) and negative (Sindh). The dose-response curve for particulate matter and COVID-19 had inverted U-shaped (Pakistan, Punjab, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) positively sloped (Islamabad Capital Territory), and negatively sloped (Sindh). The inverted U-shaped association shows that the COVID-19 initially increased due to a rise in the particulate matter but reduced when the particulate matter was above the threshold level. The particulate matter was also responsible to wear face masks and restricted mobility. The expected log count of COVID-19 cases was reduced by 0.005 times in Sindh for 1 unit increase in particulate matter. It is recommended to reduce particulate matter to control respiratory problems. The government should use media (print, electronic, social) and educational syllabus to create awareness about precautionary measures.","Ali, Q; Raza, A; Saghir, S; Khan, M T I",Int J Environ Sci Technol (Tehran),,583
227013,Food for thought: the importance of nutritional well-being during COVID-19,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to marked changes in surgical training, including that of plastic surgery residents. We performed a survey to gain an insight into the self-reported current and future impact of COVID-19 on plastic surgery residents. Methods: A 20-point questionnaire was designed by a panel of surgical trainees and trainers, which was filled in by Belgian plastic surgery residents and their international network of peers between 19 and 26 April 2020-week 6 of stringent Belgian lockdown measures. Questions covered the impact of COVID-19 on surgical activity, surgical training, and the future of training. Results: Thirty-five of 38 plastic surgery residents in Belgium filled in the questionnaire, as did 51 of their international peers from 9 other countries. Decreased surgical activity of >75% was reported by 86% of Belgian trainees and by 73% of international colleagues. All consultations were stopped for 26% of Belgian trainees and 37% of international peers. Forty-six percents of Belgian trainees and 27% of international peers were reassigned to different departments. Eighty-five percent of all trainees felt surgical training had suffered, yet 54% of Belgian residents and 39% of international peers felt training should not be prolonged. Anxiety regarding the pandemic was present in 54% of Belgian residents and 69% of international colleagues. Conclusions: This is the first report, expressing the voice of a representative group of plastic surgery residents, showing a significant impact of COVID-19 on training and activity. A joint effort is needed to provide continued forms of education by virtual education and skills-based learning.","Kapila, Ayush K; Schettino, Michela; Farid, Yasser; Ortiz, Socorro; Hamdi, Moustapha",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,,583

This virus has minimised the movement of humans, showing changes like never seen before. Positive effects have already been seen in nature and wildlife in the form of pollution control. The adverse effects of lockdown are seen as economic collapse. In this study, all the trauma patients coming to Acharya Vinobha Bhave Rural Hospital, Wardha were included irre-spective of their age and mode of trauma. Period of two weeks before and two weeks after the initiation of lockdown in India from 23 rdmarch 2020 have been taken into consideration. Both the outpatient and emergency patients were included in our study. We have observed a significant fall on overall trauma cases as expected due to the lockdown. There was a fall in the total number of cases by around three times. Our study showed that the demog-raphy of geriatric trauma, which remained almost the same and nearly all of them were old age females. Low-velocity trauma has shown an increase after lockdown from 42% to 64%, while the total numbers of cases are still less as compared to before the lockdown. High-velocity trauma cases have been reduced from 52% to 31% after lockdown, which indicates less road traffic-related injuries. During the lockdown, however, we have seen a significant fall in head neck and face trauma when compared to the upper limb and lower limb trauma.","Waghmare, Antariksh; Shrivastava, Sandeep; Date, Swapnil",Int.

228446,"Pivoting to ""No Contact"": A Protocol for Conducting a Virtual Reality Relaxation Home Study for Teens Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic",2021,"Background: Understanding antibody immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and how the virus evades it is of critical importance in the fight against COVID-19. Our best hope of ending the pandemic is antibody-inducing vaccination, yet the precise targets and indeed protective capacity of antibodies remain incompletely defined. The coronaviral spike is the dominant viral antigen and the target of neutralizing antibodies. We discovered neutralizing epitopes located on the distal face of the SARS-CoV-2 spike N-terminal domain (NTD). Remarkably, instead of glycosylation, the virus uses a surface-exposed loop to restrict the access to this patch, and the gate is controlled through recruitment and dissociation of a metabolite. Methods: Using cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography we mapped a tetrapyrrole binding site to a deep cleft on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD, Fig. 1) and characterized structural features of a neutralizing epitope controlled by metabolite dissociation. Results: We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike binds biliverdin and bilirubin, the tetrapyrrole products of haem metabolism, with nanomolar affinity in a pH-sensitive manner. At physiological concentrations, biliverdin significantly dampened the reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 spike with immune sera and inhibited a subset of neutralizing antibodies. Access to the tetrapyrrole-sensitive epitope is gated by a flexible loop on the distal face of the NTD. Accompanied by profound conformational changes in the NTD, antibody binding requires relocation of the gating loop, which folds into the cleft vacated by the metabolite. Conclusion: It is well-established that viruses employ extensive glycosylation of their envelopes to shield antibody epitopes. Compared to glycosylation, epitope masking via metabolite recruitment has the advantage of reversibility. For instance, pH-dependence of the spike-tetrapyrrole interaction potentially allows dissociation within the late endosomal compartment. In summary, our results indicate that the virus co-opts the haem metabolite for the evasion of humoral immunity via allosteric shielding of a sensitive epitope and demonstrate the remarkable structural plasticity of the NTD.","Rosa, A.; Pye, V.

229419,Dealing with Community Mental Health post the Fukushima disaster: lessons learnt for the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Starting from February 2020, in Italy most organizations have had a forced transition to flexible working practice - called ""smart working in emergency"" - due to the Covid-19 epidemic outbreak. This allowed to continue work activities and services and contributed to contain the risk of infection in different sectors, particularly in the public administration. OBJECTIVES: This follow up study focussed on a panel of 187 workers from the Italian Workers' Compensation Authority taking part to a pilot project ""Smart Working in INAIL"" from January 2019 to December 2019. The aim was to investigate the effects of work organization on work attitudes, work-life balance and health outcomes before and after the introduction of the smart working. METHODS: The data were collected at two time points through a web-based questionnaire. The first wave aimed to collect information up to one month before the implementation of the smart working. The second wave aimed to collect information about potential changes occurred after one year of smart working. RESULTS: This study showed that high demands, low control and low social support might lead to reduced well-being and less satisfaction with work, and have an effect on work engagement and work-life balance. Particularly, improving social support can moderate the negative impact of high strain on well-being, preventing work-life imbalance and risk of isolation. DISCUSSION: Findings and future perspectives are discussed to support stakeholders in defining policies and practices concerning health and wellbeing at work while preserving productivity, for a successful implementation of smart working in the public administration.","Di Tecco, Cristina; Ronchetti, Matteo; Russo, Simone; Ghelli, Monica; Rondinone, Bruna Maria; Persechino, Benedetta; Iavicoli, Sergio",Med Lav,,583

232567,Youth in a viral age: a collated auto-ethnographic response by young people (dis)orientated in strange times,2020,"BACKGROUND: With the aim of providing a dynamic evaluation of the effects of basic environmental parameters on COVID-19-related death rate, we assessed the correlation between average monthly high temperatures and population density, with death/rate (monthly number of deaths/1 M people) for the months of March (start of the analysis and beginning of local epidemic in most of the Western World, except in Italy where it started in February) and April 2020 (continuation of the epidemic). Different geographical areas of the Northern Hemisphere in the United States and in Europe were selected in order to provide a wide range among the different parameters. The death rates were gathered from an available dataset. As a further control, we also included latitude, as a proxy for temperature. METHODS: Utilizing a publicly available dataset, we retrieved data for the months of March and April 2020 for 25 areas in Europe and in the US. We computed the monthly number of deaths/1 M people of confirmed COVID-19 cases and calculated the average monthly high temperatures and population density for all these areas. We determined the correlation between number of deaths/1 M people and the average monthly high temperatures, the latitude and the population density. RESULTS: We divided our analysis in two parts: analysis of the correlation among the different variables in the month of March and subsequent analysis in the month of April. The differences were then evaluated. In the month of March there was no statistical correlation between average monthly high temperatures of the considered geographical areas and number of deaths/1 M people. However, a statistically significant inverse correlation became significant in the month of April between average monthly high temperatures (p = 0.0043) and latitude (p = 0.0253) with number of deaths/1 M people. We also observed a statistically significant correlation between population density and number of deaths/1 M people both in the month of March (p = 0.0297) and in the month of April (p = 0.0116), when three areas extremely populated (NYC, Los Angeles and Washington DC) were included in the calculation. Once these three areas were removed, the correlation was not statistically significant (p = 0.1695 in the month of March, and p = 0.7076 in the month of April). CONCLUSIONS: The number of COVID-19-related deaths/1 M people was essentially the same during the month of March for all the geographical areas considered, indicating essentially that the infection was circulating quite uniformly except for Lombardy, Italy, where it started earlier. Lockdown measures were implemented between the end of March and beginning of April, except for Italy which started March 9th. We observed a strong, statistically significant inverse correlation between average monthly high temperatures with the number of deaths/1 M people. We confirmed the data by analyzing the correlation with the latitude, which can be considered a proxy for high temperature. Previous studies indicated a negative effect of high climate temperatures on Sars-COV-2 spreading. Our data indicate that social distancing measure are more successful in the presence of higher average monthly temperatures in reducing COVID-19-related death rate, and a high level of population density seems to negatively impact the effect of lockdown measures.","Benedetti, Francesca; Pachetti, Maria; Marini, Bruna; Ippodrino, Rudy; Gallo, Robert C; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Zella, Davide",J Transl Med,,583

235835,Realigning Minds and Mental Health Resilience during Covid-19,2020,"Background: RNA exhibits a variety of structural configurations. Here we consider a structure to be tantamount to the noncrossing Watson-Crick and \pairGU-base pairings (secondary structure) and additional cross-serial base pairs. These interactions are called pseudoknots and are observed across the whole spectrum of RNA functionalities. In the context of studying natural RNA structures, searching for new ribozymes and designing artificial RNA, it is of interest to find RNA sequences folding into a specific structure and to analyze their induced neutral networks. Since the established inverse folding algorithms, {\tt RNAinverse}, {\tt RNA-SSD} as well as {\tt INFO-RNA} are limited to RNA secondary structures, we present in this paper the inverse folding algorithm {\tt Inv} which can deal with 3-noncrossing, canonical pseudoknot structures. Results: In this paper we present the inverse folding algorithm {\tt Inv}. We give a detailed analysis of {\tt Inv}, including pseudocodes. We show that {\tt Inv} allows to design in particular 3-noncrossing nonplanar RNA pseudoknot 3-noncrossing RNA structures-a class which is difficult to construct via dynamic programming routines. {\tt Inv} is freely available at \url{http://www.combinatorics.cn/cbpc/inv.html}. Conclusions: The algorithm {\tt Inv} extends inverse folding capabilities to RNA pseudoknot structures. In comparison with {\tt RNAinverse} it uses new ideas, for instance by considering sets of competing structures. As a result, {\tt Inv} is not only able to find novel sequences even for RNA secondary structures, it does so in the context of competing structures that potentially exhibit cross-serial interactions.","Gao, James Z.

The infection requires lifelong clinical management and is a leading risk factor for liver cancer and liver cirrhosis. Limited studies currently exist on the social impacts of living with chronic hepatitis B, especially for people from Sub-Saharan Africa. The current study explored the experiences of South Sudanese people living with chronic hepatitis B in Australia. Methods: A qualitative inquiry using face-to-face interviews with fifteen South Sudanese people with chronic hepatitis B in Australia explored the social impacts of living with chronic hepatitis B. The study purposively sampled participants who self-identified as South Sudanese with hepatitis B and over 18 years of age. Interviews were coded and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: The study identified three themes relating to the experiences of living with chronic hepatitis B, and were grouped into psychological, interpersonal and healthcare system levels. Psychological level experiences related to the uncertainty of living with chronic hepatitis B and liver cancer risk, where participants expressed persistent fear of disease progression and anxiety around death related to the disease. Interpersonal level experiences involved the disclosure of hepatitis B and its social impacts including stigma, social distancing and isolation. Healthcare system level experiences included receiving mixed messages about hepatitis B, challenges with regular testing and difficulty receiving hepatitis B treatment. Conclusion: The findings provide valuable insights into the social impacts of hepatitis B. It underlines the importance of integrated public health interventions at the community level to improve knowledge and awareness of hepatitis B which address stigma in the South Sudanese community in Australia.","Mude, William W; Fisher, Christopher M; Richmond, Jacqui; Gautier, Roslyn Le; Wallace, Jack",Ethn Health,,583

Without follow-up surveillance, some rapid and progressive newborn diseases, such as bilirubin encephalopathy, may be ignored. The characteristics of onset age of kernicterus suggest that monitoring of bilirubin level at home provides a useful way to alert hospital visits and to prevent the development of extremely hyperbilirubinemia. Therefore, we developed an online follow-up program for convenient monitoring of bilirubin level of newborns that is based on our practical experiences.

238807,Systematic Delineation of Media Polarity on COVID-19 Vaccines in Africa: Computational Linguistic Modeling Study,2021,"The developmental trajectory of the primate brain varies substantially with aging across subjects. However, this ubiquitous variability between individuals in brain structure is difficult to quantify and has thus essentially been ignored. Based on a large-scale structural magnetic resonance imaging dataset acquired from 162 cynomolgus macaques, we create a species-specific 3D template atlas of the macaque brain, and deploy normative modeling to characterize individual variations of cortical thickness (CT) and regional gray matter volume (GMV). We observed an overall decrease in total GMV and mean CT, and an increase in white matter volume from juvenile to early adult. Specifically, CT and regional GMV were greater in prefrontal and temporal cortices relative to early unimodal areas. Age-dependent trajectories of thickness and volume for each cortical region revealed an increase in the medial temporal lobe, and decreases in all other regions. A low percentage of highly individualized deviations of CT and GMV were identified (0.0021%, 0.0043%, respectively, P < 0.05, false discovery rate [FDR]-corrected). Our approach provides a natural framework to parse individual neuroanatomical differences for use as a reference standard in macaque brain research, potentially enabling inferences regarding the degree to which behavioral or symptomatic variables map onto brain structure in future disease studies.","Lv, Qiming; Yan, Mingchao; Shen, Xiangyu; Wu, Jing; Yu, Wenwen; Yan, Shengyao; Yang, Feng; Zeljic, Kristina; Shi, Yuequan; Zhou, Zuofu; Lv, Longbao; Hu, Xintian; Menon, Ravi; Wang, Zheng",Cereb. cortex,,583

(Special Issue: COVID-19: supporting scientific surge.)",2020,"Recent evidence suggests that CD147 serves as a novel receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Blocking CD147 via anti-CD147 antibody could suppress the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 replication. Meplazumab is a humanized anti-CD147 IgG2 monoclonal antibody, which may effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Here, we conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of meplazumab in healthy subjects, and an open-labeled, concurrent controlled add-on exploratory phase 2 study to determine the efficacy in COVID-19 patients. In phase 1 study, 59 subjects were enrolled and assigned to eight cohorts, and no serious treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) or TEAE grade &#8805;3 was observed. The serum and peripheral blood Cmax and area under the curve showed non-linear pharmacokinetic characteristics. No obvious relation between the incidence or titer of positive anti-drug antibody and dosage was observed in each cohort. The biodistribution study indicated that meplazumab reached lung tissue and maintained >14 days stable with the lung tissue/cardiac blood-pool ratio ranging from 0.41 to 0.32. In the exploratory phase 2 study, 17 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, and 11 hospitalized patients were involved as concurrent control. The meplazumab treatment significantly improved the discharged (P = 0.005) and case severity (P = 0.021), and reduced the time to virus negative (P = 0.045) in comparison to the control group. These results show a sound safety and tolerance of meplazumab in healthy volunteers and suggest that meplazumab could accelerate the recovery of patients from COVID-19 pneumonia with a favorable safety profile.","Bian, Huijie; Zheng, Zhao-Hui; Wei, Ding; Wen, Aidong; Zhang, Zheng; Lian, Jian-Qi; Kang, Wen-Zhen; Hao, Chun-Qiu; Wang, Jing; Xie, Rong-Hua; Dong, Ke; Xia, Jie-Lai; Miao, Jin-Lin; Kang, Wen; Li, Guoquan; Zhang, Di; Zhang, Mingru; Sun, Xiu-Xuan; Ding, Likun; Zhang, Kui; Jia, Junfeng; Ding, Jin; Li, Zhiqin; Jia, Yanyan; Liu, Lin-Na; Zhang, Zhe; Gao, Zhao-Wei; Du, Hong; Yao, Na; Wang, Qing; Wang, Ke; Geng, Jie-Jie; Wang, Bin; Guo, Ting; Chen, Ruo; Zhu, Yu-Meng; Wang, Li-Juan; He, Qian; Yao, Rui-Rui; Shi, Ying; Yang, Xiang-Min; Zhou, Jian-Sheng; Ma, Yi-Nan; Wang, Ya-Tao; Liang, Xue; Huo, Fei; Wang, Zhe; Zhang, Yang; Yang, Xu; Zhang, Ye",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,583

Especially, the tiny porous structures make sponge particulates a promising platform for drug delivery, tissue engineering, anti-infection, and wound healing by providing abundant reservoirs of broad surface and internal network for cargo shielding and shuttling. To control the sponge-like morphology and improve the diversity of drug loading, some optimized preparation techniques of sponge particulates have been developed, contributing to the simplified preparation process and improved production reproducibility. Bio-functionalized strategies, including target modification, cell membrane camouflage, and hydrogel of sponge particulates have been applied to modulate the properties, improve the performance, and extend the applications. In this review, we highlight the unique physical properties and functions, current manufacturing techniques, and an overview of spongy particulates in biomedical applications, especially in inhibition of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity.

241221,Impact of Covid-19 on the mental health needs of asylum seekers in Australia,2021,"The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the sports field unprecedentedly. The emergency alert has deprived athletes of training in a suitable environment, as they are faced with cancellations of relevant events in their sports careers. This situation can cause stress levels and other emotional disorders similar to those experienced by athletes during periods of injury. Since the relationship between psychological factors and sports injuries is well-studied, the Global Psychological Model of Sports Injury (MGPLD) is applied to this historical situation for athletes. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationships between perfectionism and trait anxiety with indicators of mental health (mood, depression, state anxiety, and stress) in high-performance athletes during confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to explore the coping strategies that athletes have applied and whether they are perceived as useful for managing negative emotional states. A cross-sectional study was conducted through online questionnaires during April 2020, adapting the Psychological Assessment Protocol of the High-Performance Sports Center of Murcia (Spain), to assess the psychological effects of confinement in a cross-cultural sample of 310 athletes (141 women and 169 men) from different countries in Europe, Asia, and America, and from diverse sports disciplines. The protocol comprised six instruments that test perfectionism, trait anxiety, mood states, stress, depression, coping strategies, and sleep. It was answered online via Google Forms. The results show that maladaptive perfectionism was related to all the indicators of athletes' mental health. However, athletes' levels of anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms are relatively low, and the use of coping strategies such as cognitive restructuring and emotional calm was associated with lower levels of negative emotional states. Besides, the Iceberg Profile, a suitable fit for the mental health model, is observed in the mood of athletes, both in men and in women, although women showed higher levels of anxiety, stress, and depression than men. A strong relationship was observed between maladaptive perfectionism and martial arts sports discipline, superior to other sports. In short, it can be concluded that high-performance athletes in the studied sample showed negative emotional state values below the expected average. Finally, the proposals for practical applications of the results collected are discussed.","Leguizamo, Federico; Olmedilla, Aurelio; Núñez, Antonio; Verdaguer, F Javier Ponseti; Gómez-Espejo, Verónica; Ruiz-Barquín, Roberto; Garcia-Mas, Alexandre",Front Public Health,,583

METHODS: The CONCEPTION study was a cohort, multidisciplinary study conducted at Conception University Hospital, in France, from March 17th to May 11th, 2020. Our study included all adult patients who underwent minor surgery in one of the seven surgical departments of our hospital: urology, digestive, plastic, gynecological, otolaryngology, gynecology or maxillofacial surgery. Preoperative self-isolation, clinical assessment using a standardized questionnaire, physical examination, nasopharyngeal RT-PCR and chest CT scan performed the day before surgery were part of our active prevention strategy. The main outcome was the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection within 21 days following surgery. The COVID-19 status of patients after discharge was updated during the postoperative consultation and to ensure the accuracy of data, all patients were contacted again by telephone. RESULTS: A total of 551 patients from six different specialized surgical Departments in our tertiary care center were enrolled in our study. More than 99% (546/551) of included patients underwent a complete preoperative Covid-19 screening including RT-PCR testing and chest CT scan upon admission to the Hospital. All RT-PCR tests were negative and in 12 cases (2.2%), preoperative chest CT scans detected pulmonary lesions consistent with the diagnosis criteria for COVID-19. No scheduled surgery was postponed. One patient (0.2%) developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection 20 days after a renal transplantation. No readmission or COVID-19 -related death within 30 days from surgery was recorded.

The objective is to assess the effectiveness of a single dose of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (BNT162b2) after twelve days of its administration in healthcare personnel (HCP) of a Health Department. Methods: A case-control study was made. HCP with suspected COVID-19 and HCP close contacts of COVID-19 cases were included between January 27 and February 7, 2021. They were PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2;those with positive PCR were considered cases and those with negative PCR were considered controls. The crude (VE) and adjusted (VEa) vaccine effectiveness to prevent COVID-19 cases and their 95% confidence interval were calculated using the formula VE = (1-Odds ratio) x 100. Results: 268 HCP were included, of which 70 (26.1%) were considered cases and 198 (73.9%) controls. The frequency of vaccine exposure in cases was 55.7% vs. 69.7% in controls (p=0.035). The VEa of the first vaccine dose was 52.6% (95%CI: 1.1-77.3). The VEa in the subgroup of HCP studied for suspected disease was 74.6% (CI95%: 38.4-89.5). Conclusions: One dose of BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 offers early protection after twelve days of administration. These data could be considered to adapt strategies and consider postponing the second dose in situations of limited vaccine supply in order to achieve the maximum number of people covered with a first dose.","Gras-Valenti, P.; Chico-Sanchez, P.; Algado-Selles, N.; Jimenez-Sepulveda, N.

Health professionals involved in dysphagia care are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in their day-to-day practices. Otolaryngologists, gastroenterologists, rehabilitation specialists, and speech-language pathologists are subject to virus exposure due to their proximity to the aerodigestive tract and reliance on aerosol-generating procedures in swallow assessments and interventions. Across the globe, professional societies and specialty associations are issuing recommendations about which procedures to use, when to use them, and how to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission during their use. Balancing safety for self, patients, and the public while maintaining adequate evidence-based dysphagia practices has become a significant challenge. This paper provides current evidence on COVID-19 transmission during commonly used dysphagia practices and provides recommendations for protection while conducting these procedures. The paper summarizes current understanding of dysphagia in patients with COVID-19 and draws on evidence for dysphagia interventions that can be provided without in-person consults and close proximity procedures including dysphagia screening and telehealth.","Miles, Anna; Connor, Nadine P; Desai, Rinki Varindani; Jadcherla, Sudarshan; Allen, Jacqui; Brodsky, Martin; Garand, Kendrea L; Malandraki, Georgia A; McCulloch, Timothy M; Moss, Marc; Murray, Joseph; Pulia, Michael; Riquelme, Luis F; Langmore, Susan E",Dysphagia,,583

As the COVID-19 pandemic increased the need for remote delivery tools, we explored the effectiveness of remote audio coaching (RAC) to teach this skill to college students with IDD. We used a multiple baseline design across participants to examine whether RAC might increase on-topic, small talk conversational exchanges. Results demonstrated that RAC effectively increased small talk skills between participants and a confederate. Upon removal of RAC, all participants still performed above their baselines, with two participants maintaining near mastery levels 2 weeks after the intervention was removed.

Each MOCHA parameter was independently associated with a thrombotic event (p<0.05) and &#8805; 2 abnormalities was associated with thrombotic endpoints (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-8.8) as were admission D-dimer &#8805; 2000 ng/mL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.6) and &#8805; 3000 ng/mL (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.9). However, only &#8805; 2 MOCHA abnormalities were associated with ICU admission (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.7-5.2) and intubation (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6-6.4). MOCHA and D-dimer cutoffs were not associated with mortality. MOCHA with <2 abnormalities (26% of the cohort) had 89% sensitivity and 93% negative predictive value for a thrombotic endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: An admission MOCHA profile is useful to risk-stratify COVID-19 patients for thrombotic complications and more effective than isolated d-dimer for predicting risk of ICU admission and intubation.","Alabyad, Darwish; Rangaraju, Srikant; Liu, Michael; Imran, Rajeel; Kempton, Christine L; Sharifpour, Milad; Auld, Sara C; Gaddh, Manila; Sniecinski, Roman; Maier, Cheryl L; Guarner, Jeannette; Duncan, Alexander; Nahab, Fadi",PLoS One,,583

248466,COVID-19 Vaccines- Panacea or Delusion: A Public Health Perspective,2020,"Since December 2019, a global pandemic has been observed, caused by the emergence of a new coronavirus, SARS CoV-2. The latter is responsible for the respiratory disease, COVID-19. The infection is also characterized by renal, hepatic, and gastrointestinal dysfunctions suggesting the spread of the virus to other organs. A dysregulated immune response was also reported. To date, there is no measure to treat or prevent SARS CoV-2 infection. Additionally, as gut microbiota composition is altered in patients with COVID-19, alternative therapies using probiotics can be considered to fight SARS CoV-2 infection. This review aims at summarizing the current knowledge about next-generation probiotics (NGPs) and their benefits in viral respiratory tract infections and in COVID-19. We describe these bacteria, highlighted by studies using metagenomic approaches. In addition, these bacteria generate metabolites such as butyrate, desaminotyrosine, and secondary bile acid, suggested to prevent viral respiratory infections. Gut microbial metabolites transported via the circulation to the lungs could inhibit viral replication or improve the immune response against viruses. The use of probiotics and/or their metabolites may target either the virus itself and/or the immunologic process. However, this review showed that more studies are needed to determine the benefits of probiotics and metabolite products in COVID-19.","Gautier, T.; David-Le Gall, S.; Sweidan, A.; Tamanai-Shacoori, Z.; Jolivet-Gougeon, A.; Loreal, O.; Bousarghin, L.",Microorganisms,,583

No specific anti-virus drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of this sudden and lethal disease. The supportive care and non-specific treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently. At the top of these conventional therapies, greater than 85% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in China are receiving Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment. In this article, relevant published literatures are thoroughly reviewed and current applications of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients are analyzed. Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV, the clinical evidence showing the beneficial effect of TCM in the treatment of patients with SARS coronaviral infections are discussed. Current experiment studies that provide an insight into the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of TCM, and those studies identified novel naturally occurring compounds with anti-coronaviral activity are also introduced.","Yang, Yang; Islam, Md Sahidul; Wang, Jin; Li, Yuan; Chen, Xin",Int J Biol Sci,,583

Further, the false negative rate is projected to be as high as 30% and test results can take some time to obtain. X-ray machines are widely available and provide images for diagnosis quickly. This paper explores how useful chest X-ray images can be in diagnosing COVID-19 disease. We have obtained 122 chest X-rays of COVID-19 and over 4,000 chest X-rays of viral and bacterial pneumonia. A pretrained deep convolutional neural network has been tuned on 102 COVID-19 cases and 102 other pneumonia cases in a 10-fold cross validation. The results were all 102 COVID-19 cases were correctly classified and there were 8 false positives resulting in an AUC of 0.997. On a test set of 20 unseen COVID-19 cases all were correctly classified and more than 95% of 4171 other pneumonia examples were correctly classified. This study has flaws, most critically a lack of information about where in the disease process the COVID-19 cases were and the small data set size.

250436,"""We've got through hard times before: acute mental distress and coping among disadvantaged groups during COVID-19 lockdown in North India - a qualitative study""",2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity is a major concern in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention and economic reopening. However, rigorous determination of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is very difficult owing to its continuous evolution with over 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) variants in many subtypes. We employ an algebraic topology-based machine learning model to quantitatively evaluate the binding free energy changes of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor following mutations. We reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 virus becomes more infectious. Three out of six SARS-CoV-2 subtypes have become slightly more infectious, while the other three subtypes have significantly strengthened their infectivity. We also find that SARS-CoV-2 is slightly more infectious than SARS-CoV according to computed S protein-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding free energy changes. Based on a systematic evaluation of all possible 3686 future mutations on the S protein receptor-binding domain, we show that most likely future mutations will make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious. Combining sequence alignment, probability analysis, and binding free energy calculation, we predict that a few residues on the receptor-binding motif, i.e., 452, 489, 500, 501, and 505, have high chances to mutate into significantly more infectious COVID-19 strains.","Chen, Jiahui; Wang, Rui; Wang, Menglun; Wei, Guo-Wei",J Mol Biol,,583

In response to Hooper's book, The River (1999), the Royal Society in London held a conference to debate the origins of HIV. Examination of the quick dismissal of the OPV theory opens a space for legitimately challenging the widely held belief that the vaccine contamination question was convincingly resolved. This article interrogates the relationship between historiography and the making of scientific facts and history, suggesting that historians have been too credulous of scientists' testimony. The further result of the lack of a thorough analysis of the evidence backing the OPV hypothesis has resulted in a missed opportunity to read The River as one of the few detailed accounts of the immense social, political, technological, and interspecies infrastructure constituted by Cold War vaccine production. This biomedical infrastructure dramatically changed the geographic and interspecies mobility of viruses in ways that may be impossible to reconstruct. Yet these potential transmission routes remain crucial to acknowledge. The COVID-19 pandemic draws attention to the critical importance of studying The WetNet, a concept coined by the author to name the conceptual and material infrastructures of inter- and intraspecies fluid bonding.","Jain, S Lochlann",Med. anthropol. q,,583

Unfortunately, the rapid spread of the virus has left us little time to prepare for such dataset in the wild. To circumvent this issue, we present a 3D model-based approach called WearMask3D for augmenting face images of various poses to the masked face counterparts. Our method proceeds by first fitting a 3D morphable model on the input image, second overlaying the mask surface onto the face model and warping the respective mask texture, and last projecting the 3D mask back to 2D. The mask texture is adapted based on the brightness and resolution of the input image. By working in 3D, our method can produce more natural masked faces of diverse poses from a single mask texture. To compare precisely between different augmentation approaches, we have constructed a dataset comprising masked and unmasked faces with labels called MFW-mini. Experimental results demonstrate WearMask3D produces more realistic masked faces, and utilizing these images for training leads to state-of-the-art recognition accuracy for masked faces.","Hong, Je Hyeong; Kim, Hanjo; Kim, Minsoo; Nam, Gi Pyo; Cho, Junghyun; Ko, Hyeong-Seok; Kim, Ig-Jae",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00803v2.pdf,583

254712,Eating Disorder in Teens During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"AIMS: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system and also a major receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Here, we reveal a role for NF-&#954;B in human lung cell expression of ACE2, and we further explore the potential utility of repurposing NF-&#954;B inhibitors to downregulate ACE2. MAIN METHODS: Expression of ACE2 was assessed by Western blotting and RT-qPCR in multiple human lung cell lines with or without NF-&#954;B inhibitor treatment. Surface ACE2 expression and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured with flow cytometry. p50 was knocked down with siRNA. Cytotoxicity was monitored by PARP cleavage and MTS assay. KEY FINDINGS: Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an NF-&#954;B inhibitor, suppressed endogenous ACE2 mRNA and protein expression in H322M and Calu-3 cells. The ROS level in H322M cells was increased after PDTC treatment, and pretreatment with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) reversed PDTC-induced ACE2 suppression. Meanwhile, treatment with hydrogen peroxide augmented ACE2 suppression in H322M cells with p50 knockdown. Two repurposed NF-&#954;B inhibitors, the anthelmintic drug triclabendazole and the antiprotozoal drug emetine, also reduced ACE2 mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, zinc supplementation augmented the suppressive effects of triclabendazole and emetine on ACE2 expression in H322M and Calu-3 cells. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that ACE2 expression is modulated by ROS and NF-&#954;B signaling in human lung cells, and the combination of zinc with triclabendazole or emetine shows promise for clinical treatment of ACE2-related disease.","Lee, Ming-Cheng; Chen, Yin-Kai; Tsai-Wu, Jyy-Jih; Hsu, Yih-Jen; Lin, Bor-Ru",Life Sci,,583

Recently, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has grown to be a global public health emergency but no effective drug is available to date. Several studies investigated MSCs therapy for COVID-19 patients. However, it remains unclear whether MSCs could be the host cells of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) and whether they might affect the SARS-CoV-2 entry into other cells. Here, we report that human MSCs barely express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two receptors required for the virus endocytosis, indicating that MSCs are free from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we observed that MSCs were unable to induce the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in epithelial cells and macrophages. Importantly, under different inflammatory challenge conditions, implanted human MSCs failed to up-regulate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the lung tissues of mice. Intriguingly, we showed that a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus failed to infect MSCs and co-cultured MSCs did not increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in epithelial cells. All these results suggest that human MSCs have no risk of assisting SARS-CoV-2 infection and the use of MSCs as the therapy for COVID-19 patients is feasible and safe.","Cao, Yajun; Wu, Hongyan; Zhai, Wanli; Wang, Ying; Li, Mengdi; Li, Meng; Yang, Liu; Tian, Ye; Song, Yunhao; Li, Jun; Wang, Yinyin; Ding, Qiang; Zhang, Linqi; Cai, Ming; Chang, Zhijie",Stem Cell Res,,583

In this study, we utilized comprehensive satellite, ground-level observations, and source-oriented chemical transport modeling to investigate the O3 variations during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Here we found that the significant elevated O3 in the North China Plain (40%) and Yangtze River Delta (35%) were mainly attributed to the enhanced atmospheric oxidant capacity (AOC) in these regions, associated with the meteorology and emission reduction during lockdown. Besides, O3 formation regimes shifted from VOC-limited regimes to NOx-limited and transition regimes with the decline of NOx during lockdown. We suggest that future O3 control policies should comprehensively consider the effects of AOC on the O3 elevation and coordinated regulations of the O3 precursor emissions.","Zhu, Shengqiang Poetzscher James Shen Juanyong Wang Siyu Wang Peng Zhang Hongliang",Geophysical Research Letters,,583

260623,Loneliness: A signature mental health concern in the era of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the absence of vaccines and established treatments, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are fundamental tools to control coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission. NPIs require public interest to be successful. In the United States, there is a lack of published research on the factors that influence public interest in COVID-19. Using Google Trends, we examined the US level of public interest in COVID-19 and how it correlated to testing and with other countries. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine how public interest in COVID-19 in the United States changed over time and the key factors that drove this change, such as testing. US public interest in COVID-19 was compared to that in countries that have been more successful in their containment and mitigation strategies. METHODS: In this retrospective study, Google Trends was used to analyze the volume of internet searches within the United States relating to COVID-19, focusing on dates between December 31, 2019, and March 24, 2020. The volume of internet searches related to COVID-19 was compared to that in other countries. RESULTS: Throughout January and February 2020, there was limited search interest in COVID-19 within the United States. Interest declined for the first 21 days of February. A similar decline was seen in geographical regions that were later found to be experiencing undetected community transmission in February. Between March 9 and March 12, 2020, there was a rapid rise in search interest. This rise in search interest was positively correlated with the rise of positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 (6.3, 95% CI -2.9 to 9.7; P<.001). Within the United States, it took 52 days for search interest to rise substantially after the first positive case; in countries with more successful outbreak control, search interest rose in less than 15 days. CONCLUSIONS: Containment and mitigation strategies require public interest to be successful. The initial level of COVID-19 public interest in the United States was limited and even decreased during a time when containment and mitigation strategies were being established. A lack of public interest in COVID-19 existed in the United States when containment and mitigation policies were in place.

The test has two steps: (1) heat saliva with a stabilization solution and (2) detect virus by incubating with a primer/enzyme mix. After incubation, saliva samples containing the SARS-CoV-2 genome turn bright yellow. Because this test is pH dependent, it can react falsely to some naturally acidic saliva samples. We report unique saliva stabilization protocols that rendered 295 healthy saliva samples compatible with the test, producing zero false positives. We also evaluated the test on 278 saliva samples from individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 but had no symptoms at the time of saliva collection, and from 54 matched pairs of saliva and anterior nasal samples from infected individuals. The Saliva TwoStep test described herein identified infections with 94% sensitivity and >99% specificity in individuals with sub-clinical (asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic) infections.","Yang, Qing; Meyerson, Nicholas R; Clark, Stephen K; Paige, Camille L; Fattor, Will T; Gilchrist, Alison R; Barbachano-Guerrero, Arturo; Healy, Benjamin G; Worden-Sapper, Emma R; Wu, Sharon S; Muhlrad, Denise; Decker, Carolyn J; Saldi, Tassa K; Lasda, Erika; Gonzales, Patrick; Fink, Morgan R; Tat, Kimngan L; Hager, Cole R; Davis, Jack C; Ozeroff, Christopher D; Brisson, Gloria R; McQueen, Matthew B; Leinwand, Leslie A; Parker, Roy; Sawyer, Sara L",eLife (Cambridge),,583

Nanotechnology has played a significant role in the success of these vaccines. Nanoparticles (NPs) aid in improving stability by protecting the encapsulated mRNA from ribonucleases and facilitate delivery of intact mRNA to the target site. The overwhelming success of these two mRNA based vaccines with ~95% efficacy in phase 3 clinical trials can be attributed to their unique nanocarrier, the ""lipid nanoparticles"" (LNPs). LNPs are unique compared with bilayered liposomes and provide improved stability of the cargo, possess rigid morphology, and aid in better cellular penetration. This EUA is a major milestone and showcases the immense potential of nanotechnology for vaccine delivery and for fighting against future pandemics. Currently, these two vaccines are aiding in the alleviation of the COVID-19 health crisis and demonstrate the potential utility of nanomedicine for tackling health problems at the global level.","Khurana, Amit; Allawadhi, Prince; Khurana, Isha; Allwadhi, Sachin; Weiskirchen, Ralf; Banothu, Anil Kumar; Chhabra, Deepak; Joshi, Kamaldeep; Bharani, Kala Kumar",Nano Today,,583

There are approximately 900 anesthesiologists in Israel, working in non-private hospitals. This nationwide cross-sectional study evaluated the readiness and involvement of anesthesia departments in Israel in management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact on anesthesiologists' health, workload, and clinical practices were also evaluated. METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to all of anesthesia department chairs in Israel on April 14th. Each response was identifiable on the hospital level only. Informed consent was waived since no patient data were collected. RESULTS: Response rate was 100%. A decrease of at least 40% in operating-room activity was reported by two-thirds of the departments. Anesthesiologists are leading the treatment of COVID-19 patients in 19/28 (68%) Israeli hospitals. Israel Society of Anesthesiologists' recommendations regarding intubation of COVID-19 patients were strictly followed (intubations performed by the most experienced available physician, by rapid-sequence induction utilizing video-laryngoscopy, while minimizing the number of people in the room - about 90% compliance for each). Anesthesiologists in most departments use standard personal protective equipment when caring for COVID-19 patients, including N95 masks, face shields, and water-proof gowns. Only one anesthesiologist across Israel was diagnosed with COVID-19 (unknown source of transmission). All department chairs reported emerging opportunities that advance the anesthesia profession: implementation of new technologies and improvement in caregivers' clinical capabilities (68% each), purchase of new equipment (96%), and increase in research activity (36%). CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide cross-sectional study had a complete response rate and therefore well-represents the anesthesia practice in Israel. We found that Israeli anesthesia departments are generally highly involved in the health system efforts to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Anesthesia and airway management are performed in a remarkably comparable manner and with proper protection of caregivers. Ambulatory anesthesia activity has dramatically decreased, but many departments find opportunities for improvement even in these challenging times.","Cohen, Barak; Baar, Yuval; Fein, Shai; Matot, Idit",BMC Anesthesiol,,583
267432,Factors influencing likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination: A survey of Tennessee adults,2021,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) was detected in Wuhan, China, which is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-CoV-2). AIM: This study attempted a narrative review of the researches about COVID-19 in children. METHODS: We searched all articles between 2000 and April 2020 in PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect related to COVID-19 in children, using the following terms: “COVID-19,” “coronavirus,” “SARS-CoV-2” in combination with “pediatrics,” or “children.” RESULTS: The most common method of transmitting the disease to children was through close contact with family members through respiratory droplets. Coinfection is common in pediatric with COVID-19 infection. One of the most important transmission routes is oral feces. The severity of the disease was mild or asymptomatic in most children. The most common clinical symptoms were fever and cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms were more common in children than in adults. Infants and preschoolers had more severe clinical symptoms than older children. The most common radiographic findings from the lungs were bilateral ground-glass opacity. Increased procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase should be considered in children. The use of intravenous immunoglobulin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and oseltamivir, along with oxygen therapy, had the greatest effect on improving children’s conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The most important way to prevent this disease in children is to follow the health tips of family members. Although the number of children with the disease is low, children are vulnerable to infection. Antiviral medications along with the use of muscle relaxants and oxygen therapy have a great impact on children’s condition.","Razavi, Alireza; Davoodi, Lotfollah; Shojaei, Layla; Jafarpour, Hamed",Open Access Maced.

Many patients with lung cancer are thought to be affected by this situation. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer treatment scheduling. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of lung cancer patients who were undergoing anticancer treatment at the National Hospital Organization Kyoto Medical Center (600 beds) in Kyoto, Japan, between 1 March 2020 and 31 May 2020. After the medical records were reviewed, the patients were assigned to one of two groups, depending on whether their lung cancer treatment schedule was delayed. We assessed the characteristics, types of histopathology and treatment, and the reason for the delay. A total 15 (9.1%) patients experienced a delay in lung cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with a treatment delay received significantly more immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy than patients without a treatment delay (P = 0.0057). On the contrary, no patients receiving molecular targeted agents experienced a treatment delay during the COVID-19 pandemic period (P = 0.0027). The treatments of most of the patients were delayed at their request. We determined that 9.1% lung cancer patients suffered anxiety and requested a treatment delay during the COVID-19 pandemic. Oncologists should bear in mind that patients with cancer have more anxiety than expected under unprecedented circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fujita, Kohei; Ito, Takanori; Saito, Zentaro; Kanai, Osamu; Nakatani, Koichi; Mio, Tadashi",Thorac Cancer,,583

The participants included 1780 left-behind (960 boys) and 1500 non-left-behind (811 boys) children in elementary and junior high school with a mean age of 11.23. Self-reported questionnaires concerning children's depression, loneliness, anxiety, and academic adjustment, and parents' coping with children's negative emotions were completed. The results suggested that compared with non-left-behind children, left-behind children's depression and anxiety symptoms were more severe and their academic adjustment was poorer. However, left-behind children had lower levels of loneliness than non-left-behind children. Additionally, supportive coping types, especially emotion-focused and problem-focused reactions, were significantly negatively correlated with children's depression and anxiety. Unsupportive coping types, especially distress and punitive reactions, were significantly positively correlated with children's depression and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, the relationships between punitive reactions and depression, ignoring and loneliness and problem-focused reactions and academic adjustment were significantly stronger in left-behind children. Hence, during the pandemic, left-behind children were still at a disadvantage even with their parents' company. However, parents' coping style towards left-behind children's negative emotions played a significant role in their adjustment.","Wang, Yining; Liu, Wen; Wang, Weiwei; Lin, Shuang; Lin, Danhua; Wang, Hongli",Int J Psychol,,583

Audio-recordings were transcribed and coded using NVivo 12. Analysis was conducted using Grounded Theory. RESULTS: The pandemic did not alter most participants' decisions to undergo prenatal genetic testing. Yet, it did impact how participants viewed the risks and benefits of testing and timing of testing. There was heightened anxiety among those who underwent testing, stemming from the risk of viral exposure and the fear of being alone if pregnancy loss or fetal abnormality was identified at the time of an ultrasound-based procedure. CONCLUSION: The pandemic may impact patients' access and utilization of prenatal genetic tests. More research is needed to determine how best to meet pregnant patients' decision-making needs during this time. This article is protected by copyright.

273678,Management of chronic cardiometabolic conditions and mental health during COVID-19,2020,"Inflammation is an evolutionary process that allows survival against acute infection or injury. Inflammation is also a pathophysiological condition shared by numerous chronic diseases. In addition, inflammation modulates important drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters (DMETs), thus contributing to intra- and interindividual variability of drug exposure. A better knowledge of the impact of inflammation on drug metabolism and its related clinical consequences would help to personalize drug treatment. Here, we summarize the kinetics of inflammatory mediators and the underlying transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms by which they contribute to the inhibition of important DMETs. We also present an updated overview of the effect of inflammation on the pharmacokinetic parameters of most of the drugs that are DMET substrates, for which therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended. Furthermore, we provide opinions on how to integrate the inflammatory status into pharmacogenetics, therapeutic drug monitoring, and population pharmacokinetic strategies to improve the personalization of drug treatment for each patient.","Stanke-Labesque, Françoise; Gautier-Veyret, Elodie; Chhun, Stephanie; Guilhaumou, Romain",Pharmacol Ther,,583

276289,Racial Disparities In Excess All-Cause Mortality During The Early COVID-19 Pandemic Varied Substantially Across States,2021,"In many enterprises and the private sector, the Internet of Things (IoT) has spread globally. The growing number of different devices connected to the IoT and their various protocols have contributed to the increasing number of attacks, such as denial-of-service (DoS) and remote-to-local (R2L) ones. There are several approaches and techniques that can be used to construct attack detection models, such as machine learning, data mining, and statistical analysis. Nowadays, this technique is commonly used because it can provide precise analysis and results. Therefore, we decided to study the previous literature on the detection of IoT attacks and machine learning in order to understand the process of creating detection models. We also evaluated various datasets used for the models, IoT attack types, independent variables used for the models, evaluation metrics for assessment of models, and monitoring infrastructure using DevSecOps pipelines. We found 49 primary studies, and the detection models were developed using seven different types of machine learning techniques. Most primary studies used IoT device testbed datasets, and others used public datasets such as NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. When it comes to measuring the efficiency of models, both numerical and graphical measures are commonly used. Most IoT attacks occur at the network layer according to the literature. If the detection models applied DevSecOps pipelines in development processes for IoT devices, they were more secure. From the results of this paper, we found that machine learning techniques can detect IoT attacks, but there are a few issues in the design of detection models. We also recommend the continued use of hybrid frameworks for the improved detection of IoT attacks, advanced monitoring infrastructure configurations using methods based on software pipelines, and the use of machine learning techniques for advanced supervision and monitoring.","Ahmed, Bahaa Abdelaziz Ahmed Abdalla Sayed Elfangary Laila Fahmy Hanan",Information,,583

277022,Transition from pandemic to infodemic: an analysis of Turkishlanguage COVID-19 YouTube videos,2021,"In December 2019, an atypical pneumonia invaded the city of Wuhan, China, and the causative agent of this disease turned out to be a new coronavirus. In January 2020, the World Health Organization named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV and subsequently it is referred to as SARS-CoV2 and the related disease as CoViD-19 (Lai et al., 2020). Very quickly, the epidemic led to a pandemic and it is now a worldwide emergency requiring the creation of new antiviral therapies and a related vaccine. The purpose of this article is to review and investigate further the molecular mechanism by which the SARS-CoV2 virus infection proceeds via the formation of a hetero-trimer between its protein S, the ACE2 receptor and the B0AT1 protein, which is the ""entry receptor"" for the infection process involving membrane fusion (Li et al., 2003). A reverse engineering process uses the formalism of the Hill function to represent the functions related to the dynamics of the biochemical interactions of the viral infection process. Then, using a logical evaluation of viral density that measures the rate at which the cells are hijacked by the virus (and they provide a place for the virus to replicate) and considering the ""time delay"" given by the interaction between cell and virus, the expected duration of the incubation period is predicted. The conclusion is that the density of the virus varies from the ""exposure time"" to the ""interaction time"" (virus-cells). This model can be used both to evaluate the infectious condition and to analyze the incubation period. BACKGROUND: The ongoing threat of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2 pandemic is alarming and strategies for combating infection are highly desired. This RNA virus belongs to the ß-coronavirus genus and is similar in some features to SARS-CoV. Currently, no vaccine or approved medical treatment is available. The complex dynamics of the rapid spread of this virus can be demonstrated with the aid of a computational framework. METHODS: A mathematical model based on the principles of cell-virus interaction is developed in this manuscript. The amino acid sequence of S proein and its interaction with the ACE-2 protein is mimicked with the aid of Hill function. The mathematical model with delay is solved with the aid of numerical solvers and the parametric values are obtained with the help of MCMC algorithm. RESULTS: A delay differential equation model is developed to demonstrate the dynamics of target cells, infected cells and the SARS-CoV2. The important parameters and coefficients are demonstrated with the aid of numerical computations. The resulting thresholds and forecasting may prove to be useful tools for future experimental studies and control strategies. CONCLUSIONS: From the analysis, I is concluded that control strategy via delay is a promising technique and the role of Hill function formalism in control strategies can be better interpreted in an inexpensive manner with the aid of a theoretical framework.","Sohail, Ayesha; Nutini, Alessandro",Prog Biophys Mol Biol,,583

At present standard treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not well defined because the evidence, either from randomized or observational studies, with conflicting results, has led to rapid changes in treatment guidelines. Our aim was to narratively summarize the available literature on the management of COVID-19 in order to combine current evidence and interpretation of the data by experts who are treating patients in the frontline setting. METHODS: The panel conducted a detailed review of the literature and eventual press releases from randomized clinical trials for each possible available treatment. Inductive PubMed search waws performed for publications relevant to the topic, including all clinical trials conducted. The result was a flowchart with treatment indications for patients with COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS: After 6 months of a pandemic situation and before a possible second coronavirus wave descends on Europe, it is important to evaluate which drugs proved to be effective while also considering that results from many randomized clinical trials are still awaited. Indeed, among treatments for COVID-19, only glucocorticoids have resulted in an association with a significant decrease in mortality in published randomized controlled trials.

While state Medicaid programs are currently expanding coverage policies and enrollment to address acute public health needs, states will soon face significant budget shortfalls. These impending changes may renew partisan debates about restrictive policies like work requirements, which generally require beneficiaries to verify their participation in certain activities-such as employment, job search, or training programs-in order to receive or retain coverage. We argue that restrictive Medicaid policies are driven, to a great extent, by political party affiliation, highlighting the outsized role of partisanship in Medicaid policy adoption. To combat these dynamics, additional efforts are needed to improve community-informed decision-making, strengthen evaluation approaches to tie evidence to policymaking, and boost participation in and understanding of the political processes that affect policy change.","Zhu, Jane M; Grande, David; Jones, David K; Tipirneni, Renuka",J Gen Intern Med,,583

This study aimed to evaluate the association between preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing and postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing elective cancer surgery. METHODS: This international cohort study included adult patients undergoing elective surgery for cancer in areas affected by SARS-CoV-2 up to 19 April 2020. Patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection before operation were excluded. The primary outcome measure was postoperative pulmonary complications at 30 days after surgery. Preoperative testing strategies were adjusted for confounding using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Of 8784 patients (432 hospitals, 53 countries), 2303 patients (26.2 per cent) underwent preoperative testing: 1458 (16.6 per cent) had a swab test, 521 (5.9 per cent) CT only, and 324 (3.7 per cent) swab and CT. Pulmonary complications occurred in 3.9 per cent, whereas SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 2.6 per cent. After risk adjustment, having at least one negative preoperative nasopharyngeal swab test (adjusted odds ratio 0.68, 95 per cent confidence interval 0.68 to 0.98; P = 0.040) was associated with a lower rate of pulmonary complications. Swab testing was beneficial before major surgery and in areas with a high 14-day SARS-CoV-2 case notification rate, but not before minor surgery or in low-risk areas. To prevent one pulmonary complication, the number needed to swab test before major or minor surgery was 18 and 48 respectively in high-risk areas, and 73 and 387 in low-risk areas. CONCLUSION: Preoperative nasopharyngeal swab testing was beneficial before major surgery and in high SARS-CoV-2 risk areas.

In addition, overweight/obese patients were more likely to improve other healthy behaviors on a larger scale than patients with normal BMI: increased intake of fruits and vegetables, reduction of snacks intake, and reduction of total dietary intake. WL was observed in 18.9% of people with a BMI &#8805;25 kg/m2, whereas 28.6% of them gained weight. Lifestyle favorable changes characterized patients with WL. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of overweight/obese patients with diabetes seized the opportunity of lockdown to improve their lifestyle and to lose weight. Identifying those people may help clinicians to personalize practical advice in the case of a recurrent lockdown.","Hansel, Boris; Potier, Louis; Chalopin, Sarah; Larger, Etienne; Gautier, Jean-François; Delestre, Fabienne; Masdoua, Virginie; Visseaux, Benoit; Lucet, Jean-Christophe; Kerneis, Solen; Abouleka, Yawa; Thebaut, Jean-François; Riveline, Jean-Pierre; Kadouch, Diana; Roussel, Ronan",Nutr. metab. cardiovasc. dis,,583

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic was first reported in Wuhan, China, and has now spread worldwide, which has brought attention to the pivotal role of nurses in public health emergencies. Work-family enrichment is a bidirectional structure, including work-to-family enrichment and family-to-work enrichment, that can yield many mutually beneficial results in both work and family domains among clinical nurses. However, few studies have investigated work-family enrichment and its influential factors among front-line nurses during public health emergencies. METHODS: A cross-sectional research design was adopted with a snowball sample of 258 Chinese nurses assisting Wuhan's anti-pandemic efforts. Data were collected from March 21, 2020 until April 10, 2020 through a battery of online questionnaires. Descriptive, univariate, and hierarchical linear regression analyses and a Pearson correlation test were performed. A STROBE checklist was used to report findings. RESULTS: The results showed that prosocial motivation, family support and job support predicted high work-to-family enrichment in those nurses, while prosocial motivation, family support, and family boundary flexibility predicted high family-to-work enrichment. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed the importance of paying attention to the work-family enrichment of front-line medical workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, so that they could concentrate on their anti-pandemic work and maintain their enthusiasm for disaster nursing. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The findings can help health administrators in affected countries around the world identify the influential factors of work-family enrichment among front-line nurses during infectious disease outbreaks, specifically in the areas of mobilizing nurses' prosocial motivation and giving sufficient job support.","Zhang, Yinying; Yang, Min; Wang, Rong",J. clin. nurs,,583

287104,The digital divide: Amplifying health inequalities for people with severe mental illness in the time of covid-19,2021,"The catalytic subunit of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) Nsp12 has a unique nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain that transfers nucleoside monophosphates to the Nsp9 protein and the nascent RNA. The NiRAN and RdRp modules form a dynamic interface distant from their catalytic sites, and both activities are essential for viral replication. We report that codon-optimized (for the pause-free translation in bacterial cells) Nsp12 exists in an inactive state in which NiRAN-RdRp interactions are broken, whereas translation by slow ribosomes and incubation with accessory Nsp7/8 subunits or nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) partially rescue RdRp activity. Our data show that adenosine and remdesivir triphosphates promote the synthesis of A-less RNAs, as does ppGpp, while amino acid substitutions at the NiRAN-RdRp interface augment activation, suggesting that ligand binding to the NiRAN catalytic site modulates RdRp activity. The existence of allosterically linked nucleotidyl transferase sites that utilize the same substrates has important implications for understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 replication and the design of its inhibitors. IMPORTANCE In vitro interrogations of the central replicative complex of SARS-CoV-2, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), by structural, biochemical, and biophysical methods yielded an unprecedented windfall of information that, in turn, instructs drug development and administration, genomic surveillance, and other aspects of the evolving pandemic response. They also illuminated the vast disparity in the methods used to produce RdRp for experimental work and the hidden impact that this has on enzyme activity and research outcomes. In this report, we elucidate the positive and negative effects of codon optimization on the activity and folding of the recombinant RdRp and detail the design of a highly sensitive in vitro assay of RdRp-dependent RNA synthesis. Using this assay, we demonstrate that RdRp is allosterically activated by nontemplating phosphorylated nucleotides, including naturally occurring alarmone ppGpp and synthetic remdesivir triphosphate.","Wang, Bing; Svetlov, Vladimir; Wolf, Yuri I; Koonin, Eugene V; Nudler, Evgeny; Artsimovitch, Irina",mBio,,583

Despite its well-documented merit as a model of practice, social medicine remains underrepresented at the undergraduate medical education level. We hypothesize that the success of this student-led COVID-19 initiative proposes a tangible and innovative solution to address the lack of social medicine exposure in undergraduate medical education. Methodology: We sought to evaluate the impact of sustaining clinical learning during the pandemic using the social pediatrics model as a didactic vector for clerkship students. We extracted learning objectives relevant to the teaching of social medicine from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada's CanMEDS framework and developed a survey aimed at evaluating the attainability of each of those objectives. The survey was distributed to students enrolled in the social pediatrics COVID-19 initiative after 6 weeks (April-May), as well as a control group. Results: Completing the survey were 19 students from the University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine, 7 in the intervention group and 12 in the control group. Students that participated in the social pediatrics initiative yielded significantly higher values for the achievement of 6 out of 9 social medicine learning objectives when compared to the control group. Although the values followed a similar trend for the remaining 3 objectives, favoring the intervention group, they were not statistically significant. Conclusion: The positive results from this study and the COVID-19 student-led initiative template can serve as a catalyst for curricular change so as to ensure graduates are adequately trained to contend with the realities of the social landscape in which they will practice. Future plans include the incorporation of interactive social medicine experiences throughout all 4 years of medical school.","Daccache, Jennifer; Khoury, Michel; Habibi, Charlene; Bennett, Susan",J Med Educ Curric Dev,,583

The study aim was to compare short- and long-term outcomes among HCC patients with normal and diseased liver parenchyma, undergoing potentially curative liver resection in a developing country. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2001 until January 2017, 228 patients with HCC underwent curative-intent hepatectomy at the University Clinic for Digestive Surgery. From that number, 190 patients were eligible for analysis. Diseased liver (DL) was present in 112 patients while 78 patients had HCC in non-diseased liver (NDL). RESULTS: Median age, sex, ASA score, the presence of extrahepatic disease and lobar distribution of tumors were similar in both groups. The number of tumors was higher in DL group, while tumor diameter was higher in NDL group. Anatomic liver resection and major liver resections were performed more commonly in NDL than in DL group (66.7 vs 47.4%, p = 0.008; 33.3 vs. 15.2%, p = 0.003). Postoperative morbidity was significantly higher in DL group (p = 0.004). Overall survival was statistically longer in NDL group (p = 0.024). By univariate analysis potential prognostic factors for long-term survival were identified: presence of chronic HCV infection, presence of cirrhosis, Child-Pugh score B and operative time longer than 240 min. The last two were confirmed by multivariate analysis as independent negative prognostic factors for overall survival. CONCLUSION: Liver resection in patients with HCC arising in non-diseased livers, despite of need for extended hepatectomies, provides favorable long-term prognosis.","Bogdanovic, Aleksandar; Bulajic, Predrag; Zuvela, Marinko; Bidzic, Nemanja; Zivanovic, Marko; Galun, Danijel",Surg Oncol,,583

This study was conducted to assess the performance of 10 lateral flow device viral antigen immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We analyzed 231 nasopharyngeal samples collected from October 2020 to December 2020, from suspected COVID-19 cases and contacts of positive cases at Biotechnology Research Center laboratories, Tripoli, Libya. The performance of 10 COVID-19 Antigen (Ag) rapid test devices for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen was compared to a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In this study, 161 cases had symptoms consistent with COVID-19. The mean duration from symptom onset was 6.6 ± 4.3 days. The median cycle threshold (Ct ) of positive samples was 25. Among the 108 positive samples detected by RT-qPCR, the COVID-19 antigen (Ag) tests detected 83 cases correctly. All rapid Ag test devices used in this study showed 100% specificity. While tests from six manufacturers had an overall sensitivity range from 75% to 100%, the remaining four tests had a sensitivity of 50%-71.43%. Sensitivity during the first 6 days of symptoms and in samples with high viral loads (Ct < 25), was 100% in all but two of the test platforms. False-negative samples had a median Ct of 34 and an average duration of onset of symptoms of 11.3 days (range = 5-20 days). Antigen test diagnosis has high sensitivity and specificity in early disease when patients present less than 7 days of symptom onset. Patients are encouraged to test as soon as they get COVID-19-related symptoms within 1 week and to seek medical advice within 24 h if they develop disturbed smell/taste. The use of rapid antigen tests is important for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and reducing the burden on molecular diagnostic laboratories.","Abusrewil, Zakarya; Alhudiri, Inas M; Kaal, Hamza H; El Meshri, Salah Eldin; Ebrahim, Fawzi O; Dalyoum, Tarek; Efrefer, Abdussamee A; Ibrahim, Khaled; Elfghi, Mohammed B; Abusrewil, Suleiman; Elzagheid, Adam",J. med. virol,,583
289920,Legal and Health Response to COVID-19 in the Arab Countries,2021,"BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a leading cause of death worldwide, and hypoalbuminemia is associated with worse outcomes. However, it remains uncertain whether albumin administration could have any beneficial effects. We aim to assess whether the administration of albumin in hypoalbuminemic patients with CAP increases the proportion of clinically stable patients at day 5 compared with the standard of care alone. METHODS: This is a trial protocol for a superiority, non-blinded, multicenter, randomized, phase 3, interventional controlled clinical trial. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of clinical stable patients at day 5 (intention to treat), defined as those with stable vital signs for at least 24 h. The secondary endpoints will be time to clinical stability, duration of intravenous and total antibiotic treatment, length of hospital stay, intensive care unit admission, duration of mechanical ventilation and vasopressor treatment, adverse events, readmission within 30 days, and all-cause mortality. The trial has been approved by the Spanish Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. The investigators commit to publish the data in peer-reviewed journals within a year of the study completion date. Subjects will be recruited from three Spanish hospitals over a planned enrolment period of 2 years. A follow-up visit will be performed 1 month after discharge. We have estimated the need for a sample size of 360 patients at a two-sided 5% alpha-level with a power of 80% based on intention to treat. Eligible participants must be hospitalized, hypoalbuminemic (&#8804; 30 g/L), non-immunosuppressed, adults, and diagnosed with CAP. They will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive standard care plus albumin (20 g in 100 mL) every 12 h for 4 days or standard care alone. DISCUSSION: If this randomized trial confirms the hypothesis, it should lead to a change in current clinical practice for the management of hypoalbuminemic patients with CAP.

Although concerns exist that exposure may be harmful, there is a poor understanding of the smoke in terms of particle size, morphology, composition and biological viability. Notably, it is not known how the biological tissue source and cutting method influence the smoke. The objective of this study was to develop a collection method for airborne by-product from surgical cutting. This would enable comprehensive analyses of the particulate burden, composition and biological viability. The method was applied to compare the electrosurgical smoke generated (in the absence of any evacuation mechanism) with the aerosolized/airborne by-products generated by ultrasonic and high-speed cutting, from bone and liver tissue cutting. We report a wide range of particle sizes (0.93-806.31 µm for bone, 0.05-1040.43 µm for liver) with 50% of the particles being <2.72 µm (~PM2.5) and 90% being <10 µm (PM10). EDX and biochemical analysis reveal components of biological cells and cellular metabolic activity in particulate from liver tissue cut by electrosurgery and ultrasonic cutting. We show for the first time however that bone saws and ultrasonic cutting do not liberate viable cells from bone.","Casey, Vincent J; Martin, Cian; Curtin, Peter; Buckley, Kevin; McNamara, Laoise M",Ann. biomed. eng,,583

Matériels et méthodes Évaluation des freins à la vaccination par audit qualitatifs collectifs et individuels par deux médecins infectiologues intervenant dans deux unité de soins pénitentiaire en Ile de France. La première phase de l’intervention évaluait le nombre de vaccinés, de volontaires à la vaccination et de personnels ayant été infectés par le Covid-19. La deuxième phase a comporté quatre axes de communication : Premièrement réunion d’information collectives avec questions réponses en fin de présentation dans les locaux de l’unité sanitaire. Deuxièmement, une consultation personnalisée d’infectiologie, ciblée pour les réfractaires à la vaccination. Troisièmement, la remise d’une procédure formalisée, simplifié, avec un numéro de téléphone de rendez-vous de vaccination. Un mois plus tard, un rapport de retour d’expérience a été réalisé par le chef de service de l’unité sanitaire. Résultats Le 16/02/2021, à la première phase de l’audit, zéro des 88 personnels était vacciné, zéro des 88 n’avait entrepris de démarche pour se faire vacciner, 4(4,5 %) étaient volontaires « au bon moment », aucun ne se définissait comme anti vaccin et 3(3,4 %) avaient contracté le Covid-19. Au moment de l’entretien collectif : 27(30,5 %) membres du personnel étaient prévus et présent. Les principaux freins à la vaccination par ordre décroissant de fréquence étaient : « L’absence de recul chronologique suffisant », « Ne pas servir de cobayes », « la peur d’effets secondaires graves », « L’absence de clarté des informations transmises », « La défiance envers la gestion de la crise par les autorités », et « La complexité parmi le choix des vaccins proposés ». Au bilan de fin d’intervention un mois plus tard, l’ensemble des 27 présents à la réunion étaient vaccinés, et au totale 84(95,4 %) des personnels était vacciné selon le parcours de soins spécifiques proposé. Trois avaient une contre-indication temporaire, et 1 resta réfractaire malgré la consultation individuelle. Conclusion Les actions structurées de promotion de la vaccination prenant en compte les spécificités des personnels sanitaires en milieu carcéral peuvent permettre une couverture vaccinale très satisfaisante.

The first case involved a middle-age man with no known psychiatric history who presented with acute psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganization) after recovery from a recent respiratory illness. This patient tested positive for COVID-19 on admission. The patient's symptoms were not consistent with delirium and testing did not suggest a neurological etiology. The patient's psychosis eventually resolved 6 weeks after its abrupt onset with treatment with antipsychotic medication. The second case involved a 44-year-old man with a history of depression and psychotic symptoms who presented after a serious suicide attempt and tested positive for COVID-19 on admission. The patient had subsequent negative tests while on the inpatient psychiatric unit before again testing positive later in his admission. The patient's positive COVID-19 tests appeared to coincide with exacerbations in his mood symptoms, which led to the suicide attempt and psychotic episode that initially caused his admission. This patient was successfully treated with clozapine. In both of these cases, the question arose as to whether there was a link between the COVID-19 infections and the neuropsychiatric symptoms. Growing evidence suggests that severe neuropsychiatric sequelae can develop after COVID-19 infection.","Garakani, Amir",J Psychiatr Pract,,583

These receptors are widely expressed and regulate numerous physiological processes including cardiovascular and metabolic functions and airway tone. The ßARs are also important targets in the treatment of many diseases including hypertension, heart failure and asthma. In some cases, the use of current ßAR ligands to treat a disease is suboptimal and can lead to severe side effects. One strategy to potentially improve such treatments is the development of biased agonists that selectively regulate a subset of ßAR signaling pathways and responses. Here we discuss the compounds identified to date that preferentially activate a Gs- or ß-arrestin-mediated signaling pathway through ßARs. Mechanistic insight on how these compounds bias signaling sheds light on the potential development of even more selective compounds that should have increased utility in treating disease.","Ippolito, Michael; Benovic, Jeffrey L",Cell Signal,,583

301423,"Covid-19, mental health and physical activity",2021,"In recent years, a large number of respiratory infectious diseases (especially COVID-19) have broken out worldwide. Respiratory infectious viruses may be released in the air, resulting in cross-infection between patients and medical workers. Indoor ventilation systems can be adjusted to affect fine particles containing viruses. This study was aimed at performing a series of experiments to evaluate the ventilation performance and assess the exposure of healthcare workers (HW) to virus-laden particles released by patients in a confined experimental chamber. In a typical ward setting, four categories (top supply and exhaust, side supply and exhaust) were evaluated, encompassing 16 different air distribution patterns. The maximum reduction in the cumulative exposure level for HW was 70.8% in ventilation strategy D (upper diffusers on the sidewall supply and lower diffusers on the same sidewall return). The minimum value of the cumulative exposure level for a patient close to the source of the contamination pertained to Strategy E (upper diffusers on the sidewall supply and lower diffusers on the opposite sidewall return). Lateral ventilation strategies can provide significant guidance for ward operation to minimizing the airborne virus contamination. This study can provide a reference for sustainable buildings to construct a healthy indoor environment.","Kong, Xiangfei Guo Chenli Lin Zhang Duan Shasha He Junjie Ren Yue Ren Jianlin",Sustainable Cities and Society,,583

However, due to the limitation of their on-board power and flight time, it is challenging to obtain an optimal resource allocation scheme for the UAV-assisted Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we design a new UAV-assisted IoT systems relying on the shortest flight path of the UAVs while maximising the amount of data collected from IoT devices. Then, a deep reinforcement learning-based technique is conceived for finding the optimal trajectory and throughput in a specific coverage area. After training, the UAV has the ability to autonomously collect all the data from user nodes at a significant total sum-rate improvement while minimising the associated resources used. Numerical results are provided to highlight how our techniques strike a balance between the throughput attained, trajectory, and the time spent. More explicitly, we characterise the attainable performance in terms of the UAV trajectory, the expected reward and the total sum-rate.","Nguyen, Khoi Khac; Duong, Trung Q.; Do-Duy, Tan; Claussen, Holger; Hanzo, and Lajos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03129v1.pdf,583

304701,The health and socioeconomic impact on menopausal women of working from home,2020,"Coronavirus (COVID-19), an enveloped RNA virus, primarily affects human beings. It has been deemed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic. For this reason, COVID-19 has become one of the most lethal viruses which the modern world has ever witnessed although some established pharmaceutical companies allege that they have come up with a remedy for COVID-19. To that end, a set of carboxamides sulfonamide derivatives has been under study using 3D-QSAR approach. CoMFA and CoMSIA are one of the most cardinal techniques used in molecular modeling to mold a worthwhile 3D-QSAR model. The expected predictability has been achieved using the CoMFA model (Q2 = 0.579;R2 = 0.989;R2test = 0.791) and the CoMSIA model (Q2 = 0.542;R2 = 0.975;R2test = 0.964). In a similar vein, the contour maps extracted from both CoMFA and CoMSIA models provide much useful information to determine the structural requirements impacting the activity;subsequently, these contour maps pave the way for proposing 8 compounds with important predicted activities. The molecular surflex-docking simulation has been adopted to scrutinize the interactions existing between potentially and used antimalarial molecule on a large scale, called Chloroquine (CQ) and the proposed carboxamides sulfonamide analogs with COVID-19 main protease (PDB: 6LU7). The outcomes of the molecular docking point out that the new molecule P1 has high stability in the active site of COVID-19 and an efficient binding affinity (total scoring) in relation with the Chloroquine. Last of all, the newly designed carboxamides sulfonamide molecules have been evaluated for their oral bioavailability and toxicity, the results point out that these scaffolds have cardinal ADMET properties and can be granted as reliable inhibitors against COVID-19.","Khaldan, A.; Bouamrane, S.; En-Nahli, F.; El-Mernissi, R.; El-Khatabi, K.; Hmamouchi, R.; Maghat, H.; Ajana, M.

305211,Recommending Physical Activity During the COVID-19 Health Crisis. Fitness Influencers on Instagram,2020,"Background: As teledermatology has been widely adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to examine patients' experiences and satisfaction with teledermatology. Objective: We aimed to assess the teledermatology experiences of new and existing clinic patients in the context of the rapid shift toward teledermatology practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 184 teledermatology patients who were assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic at a major southeastern medical center from May 13 to June 5, 2020. The primary outcome was patient satisfaction levels among new and existing patients. The secondary outcome was patients' willingness to use teledermatology in the future. Results: Of the 288 teledermatology patients who were assessed during the study period, 184 (63.9%) completed the survey. Patients reported high overall satisfaction with teledermatology, with 86.4% (159/184) of participants reporting positive overall satisfaction and experiences with teledermatology. New patients had significantly higher Likert scores for overall satisfaction with teledermatology than those of follow-up patients (new patients: mean 4.70; existing patients: mean 4.43; P=.03). Overall, patients' satisfaction with teledermatology did not significantly differ based on age (P=.36), race and ethnicity (P=.46), education level (P=.11), residence (P=.74), or insurance status (P=.74). There were no significant differences in overall satisfaction between patients with and without prior telehealth experience (P=.53), between the video and telephone visit types (P=.17), and among platform types (P=.22). Prior telehealth experience was associated with higher odds of being willing to use telehealth in the future (odds ratio 2.39, 95% CI 1.31-4.35; P=.004). Conclusions: This cross-sectional survey study demonstrates that during the rapid expansion of teledermatology, new clinic patients had significantly higher scores for overall satisfaction with their teledermatology experience compared to those of established clinic patients (P=.03). Prior telehealth experience was associated with higher odds of being willing to use teledermatology in the future. Overall, teledermatology expansion was met with high levels of patient satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hamad, Judy; Fox, Amy; Kammire, Maria Suzanne; Hollis, Alison Nancy; Khairat, Saif",JMIR Dermatol,,583

This study evaluated the effectiveness of the negative pressure isolation stretcher (NPIS) and additional negative pressure isolation rooms (NPIRs) on the maintenance of emergency care capacity during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A before and after intervention study was performed between February 27, 2020 and March 31, 2020 at the ED of Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, South Korea. A total of 2455 patients who visited the ED during the study period were included. Interventions included the introduction of the NPIS and additional NPIRs in the ED. The main outcome of the study was frequency of medical cessation. Secondary outcomes were the average number of ED visits and lengths of stay. RESULTS: After the intervention, average frequency of medical cessation was significantly decreased from 1.6 times per day (range 0-4) in the pre-intervention period to 0.6 times per day (range 0-3) in the post-intervention period (p-value <0.01). On the other hand, the number of patients visiting the ED increased significantly from 67.2 persons per day (range 58-79) pre-intervention to 76.3 persons per day (range 61-88) post-intervention (p value <0.01). However, there were no statistically significant differences in the average ED length of stay across the study phases (p value = 0.50). CONCLUSIONS: This intervention may provide an effective way to prepare and meet the ED response needs of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kim, Sang-Chul; Kong, So Yeon; Park, Gwan-Jin; Lee, Ji-Han; Lee, Joon-Kee; Lee, Mou-Seop; Han, Heon Seok",Am. j. emerg. med,,583

307563,Telepsychiatry and healthcare access inequities during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Brief overview: Current evidence suggests that Echinacea supplementation may decrease the duration and severity of acute respiratory tract infections; however, no studies using Echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to COVID-19 have been identified. Few adverse events were reported, suggesting that this herbal therapy is reasonably safe. Because Echinacea can increase immune function, there is a concern that it could worsen over-activation of the immune system in cytokine storm; however, clinical trials show that Echinacea decreases levels of immune molecules involved in cytokine storm. Verdict: Echinacea supplementation may assist with the symptoms of acute respiratory infections (ARI) and the common cold, particularly when administered at the first sign of infection; however, no studies using Echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to COVID-19 have been identified. Previous studies have reported that Echinacea may decrease the severity and/or duration of ARI when taken at the onset of symptoms. The studies reporting benefit used E. purpurea or a combination of E. purpurea and E. angustifolia containing standardized amounts of active constituents.Few adverse events from the use of Echinacea were reported, suggesting that this herbal therapy is reasonably safe. No human trials could be located reporting evidence of cytokine storm when Echinacea was used for up to 4 months.When assessing all human trials which reported changes in cytokine levels in response to Echinacea supplementation, the results were largely consistent with a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines that play a role in the progression of cytokine storm and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), factors that play a significant role in the death of COVID-19 patients. While there is currently no research on the therapeutic effects of Echinacea in the management of cytokine storm, this evidence suggests that further research is warranted.","Aucoin, Monique; Cooley, Kieran; Saunders, Paul Richard; Carè, Jenny; Anheyer, Dennis; Medina, Daen N; Cardozo, Valentina; Remy, Daniella; Hannan, Nicole; Garber, Anna",Advances in integrative medicine (Print),,583

Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) are highly susceptible to environmental stress. In the current study, we aimed to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic psychologically affected patients with chronic progressive diseases such as AS and RA and the effects of these psychological factors on disease activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Age and gender-matched patients with AS (n=80), RA (n=80), and healthy controls (n=80) were included in the study. All participants were evaluated with the ?Perceived COVID-19 Threat Form (PCTF)?, ?Suicide-Ideation Scale (SIS)?, ?Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)?, ?The Ability to Cope with Trauma (PACT)? and ?Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB)? scales. BASDAI was used in patients with AS and DAS28 was used in patients with RA to assess disease severity. RESULTS: Compared to healthy individuals, patients with RA and AS had lower PGWB scores and higher HADS depression and anxiety subscale scores. Almost all psychometric assessment test scores were worse in AS patients with high-disease activity compared to those in low-disease activity. PACT scores were higher in patients with moderate RA compared to patients with mild RA (p=0.006). While a positive correlation was identified between BASDAI and most of the psychometric assessment test scores (r=0 .36 for PCTF, r= 0.53 for depressive scores, r= 0.54 for anxiety scores, r= 0.57 for suicidal ideation), DAS28 scores were found to be associated only with PACT total and PACT perceived forward-focused subscale scores (r= -.26 and r= .33, respectively). CONCLUSION: Psychologically, AS and RA patients were found to be worse off compared to healthy controls. The perceived COVID threat and psychological status were associated with disease activity in AS, but not RA patients. Patients with chronic illnesses may be more vulnerable to the psychological effects of the pandemic, which can worsen disease activity.","Gica, Sakir; Akkubak, Yasemin; Aksoy, Zakire Kübra; Küçük, Adem; Cüre, Erkan",Turkish journal of medical sciences,,583

It is, however, unknown which features of the serological response may affect clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. We analyzed 983 longitudinal plasma samples from 79 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 175 SARS-CoV-2-infected outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. Within this cohort, 25 patients died of their illness. Higher ratios of IgG antibodies targeting S1 or RBD domains of spike compared to nucleocapsid antigen were seen in outpatients who had mild illness versus severely ill patients. Plasma antibody increases correlated with decreases in viral RNAemia, but antibody responses in acute illness were insufficient to predict inpatient outcomes. Pseudovirus neutralization assays and a scalable ELISA measuring antibodies blocking RBD-ACE2 interaction were well correlated with patient IgG titers to RBD. Outpatient and asymptomatic individuals' SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, including IgG, progressively decreased during observation up to five months post-infection.","Röltgen, Katharina; Powell, Abigail E; Wirz, Oliver F; Stevens, Bryan A; Hogan, Catherine A; Najeeb, Javaria; Hunter, Molly; Wang, Hannah; Sahoo, Malaya K; Huang, ChunHong; Yamamoto, Fumiko; Manohar, Monali; Manalac, Justin; Otrelo-Cardoso, Ana R; Pham, Tho D; Rustagi, Arjun; Rogers, Angela J; Shah, Nigam H; Blish, Catherine A; Cochran, Jennifer R; Jardetzky, Theodore S; Zehnder, James L; Wang, Taia T; Narasimhan, Balasubramanian; Gombar, Saurabh; Tibshirani, Robert; Nadeau, Kari C; Kim, Peter S; Pinsky, Benjamin A; Boyd, Scott D",Sci. immunol,,583

311547,Intelligent machines and mental health in the era of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Spain is one of the European countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Serological surveys are a valuable tool to assess the extent of the epidemic, given the existence of asymptomatic cases and little access to diagnostic tests. This nationwide population-based study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain at national and regional level. METHODS: 35â883 households were selected from municipal rolls using two-stage random sampling stratified by province and municipality size, with all residents invited to participate. From April 27 to May 11, 2020, 61â075 participants (75·1% of all contacted individuals within selected households) answered a questionnaire on history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and risk factors, received a point-of-care antibody test, and, if agreed, donated a blood sample for additional testing with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Prevalences of IgG antibodies were adjusted using sampling weights and post-stratification to allow for differences in non-response rates based on age group, sex, and census-tract income. Using results for both tests, we calculated a seroprevalence range maximising either specificity (positive for both tests) or sensitivity (positive for either test). FINDINGS: Seroprevalence was 5·0% (95% CI 4·7-5·4) by the point-of-care test and 4·6% (4·3-5·0) by immunoassay, with a specificity-sensitivity range of 3·7% (3·3-4·0; both tests positive) to 6·2% (5·8-6·6; either test positive), with no differences by sex and lower seroprevalence in children younger than 10 years (<3·1% by the point-of-care test). There was substantial geographical variability, with higher prevalence around Madrid (>10%) and lower in coastal areas (<3%). Seroprevalence among 195 participants with positive PCR more than 14 days before the study visit ranged from 87·6% (81·1-92·1; both tests positive) to 91·8% (86·3-95·3; either test positive). In 7273 individuals with anosmia or at least three symptoms, seroprevalence ranged from 15·3% (13·8-16·8) to 19·3% (17·7-21·0). Around a third of seropositive participants were asymptomatic, ranging from 21·9% (19·1-24·9) to 35·8% (33·1-38·5). Only 19·5% (16·3-23·2) of symptomatic participants who were seropositive by both the point-of-care test and immunoassay reported a previous PCR test. INTERPRETATION: The majority of the Spanish population is seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in hotspot areas. Most PCR-confirmed cases have detectable antibodies, but a substantial proportion of people with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 did not have a PCR test and at least a third of infections determined by serology were asymptomatic. These results emphasise the need for maintaining public health measures to avoid a new epidemic wave.

312270,Beyond PPE: a mixed qualitative-quantitative study capturing the wider issues affecting doctors' well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"AimsStudies have shown that people with intellectual disability (ID) show a greater severity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and atypical presentation, as well as having a greater risk of developing comorbidities, such as challenging behaviour, anxiety, tic disorders and sleep problems. It is estimated that 1.5% of patients with ID will have a clinical diagnosis of ADHD.The aim of this audit was to find whether individuals with ID and ADHD, who are prescribed medication for ADHD are adequately monitored and reviewed in accordance with the ADHD medication prescription guidance by NICE and the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych).MethodThis audit looked at ADHD medication prescription for the ID population within Greater Glasgow & Clyde NHS. This is the 6th audit cycle where electronic records (EMIS) were analysed between 28/9/19 to 09/10/20. (The 5th cycle data collection period ended on 28/9/19). We collected data on all patients aged over 18 years.An audit tool was developed to find whether the following were documented;patient demographics, physical health monitoring, symptom severity, medication dosage, side effects, need for ongoing treatment and frequency of review. 100% of patients should have all components on the ADHD audit tool documented, as per NICE/ RCPsych prescription guidance.Result32 patients were identified as being diagnosed with ADHD prescribed medication. One patient was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which meant that the required monitoring was not fully carried out. The age ranged from 18 to 56 years. 75% had mild intellectual disability, 19% had moderate and 6% had severe, with no cases of profound intellectual disability. Blood Pressure/pulse was recorded in 84% of patients. Height/weight/ BMI was recorded in 81% of patients. 97% of patients had ADHD symptom severity, medication dosage, side effects, need for ongoing treatment and frequency of review recorded.ConclusionThere is further scope for improvement in the monitoring and documentation of physical health observations, however there was a significant improvement compared to the previous cycle of the audit. Other aspects of monitoring and documentation appear to be recorded in almost 100% of patients. This finding emphasises the challenges of physical health monitoring and compliance in psychiatry as a whole. We need to continue to encourage awareness and education around the physical health risks to our patients, not only due to their comorbidities but also as a result of the psychotropic medications we prescribe them.","Bansal, Neha Hayat Muzammil",BJPsych Open,,583

METHODS: Patients who were admitted to the emergency service of Izmir Çigli Training and Research Hospital between 01.04.2020 and 31.05.2020 and who were suspected of having COVID-19 infection were included in the study. The medical records of the patients were retrospectively analysed through the hospital data processing database. Age, gender, hospitalisation, status of home quarantine, real-time RT-PCR, thorax CT and rapid antibody test results of the patients were examined. The relationship between RT-PCR, thorax CT and rapid antibody test results was compared statistically. RESULTS: A total of 181 patients, 115 (63.5%) male and 66 (36.5%) female, with an average age of 56.4 ± 18.06 years were included in the study. The nasopharyngeal swab PCR result obtained at the first admission of the patients to the emergency department was positive in 71 (39.2%) patients. Rapid antibody tests performed at hospital admission were positive in 57 (31.5%) patients. Thorax CT was performed in 173 (95.6%) patients who applied to the emergency department, and 112 (64.7%) of them had findings that could be compatible with COVID-19. According to the thorax CT findings in patients, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for detecting COVID-19 infection were, respectively, 76.1%, 43.1%, 48.2% and 72.1% (Ä¸: 0.176, P < .001). According to the rapid antibody test results, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for detecting COVID-19 infection were 57.5%, 85.5%, 71.9% and 75.8%, respectively (Ä¸: 0.448, P < .001). In our study, the mortality rate for COVID-19 was found to be 2.8%. CONCLUSION: Rapid antibody test and thorax CT examinations were found to have low diagnostic value in patients who admitted to the emergency department of our hospital and whose first RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test was positive. Studies involving larger patient groups are needed for their use alone in diagnosis and screening.","Kiziloglu, Ilker; Sener, Asli; Siliv, Neslihan",Int J Clin Pract,,583

315705,Coronavirus disease-19 and access to medicines in Africa,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV, COVID-19) is historically one of the most severe acute respiratory syndromes and pandemics to affect the globe in the twenty-first century. Originating in Wuhan, the virus rapidly spread and impacted subsets of populations with initial unclear risk factors contributing to worsening morbidity and mortality. Patients with diagnosis of cancer and undergoing treatment further represent a population at risk for worsening cardiopulmonary outcomes. This review explores specific risk factors, diagnoses, and treatment options that impact cardio-oncologic patients with COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple studies globally, including Italy, China, and the USA, have documented severe outcomes. Cancer patients are at increased risk of cardiac injury which itself is a risk factor for mortality. Additionally, elderly cancer patients undergoing recent anti-cancer treatment may be at greater risk for sustaining worse outcomes, although data remains suboptimal in this population. Major gaps remain regarding risk associated with type of cancer and type of anti-cancer treatment, as well as the layered risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Immunomodulatory therapies used to treat cytokine release syndrome secondary to anti-cancer therapies, as well as other agents being traditionally used to treat cardiovascular and cancer disease states, are being investigated for treatment of COVID-19. Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer have been associated with more severe COVID-19 infection and worse outcomes. Patients undergoing anti-cancer therapy or those who have suffered from coronavirus infection may develop long-standing changes, not limited to pulmonary fibrosis, hyperlipidemia, and worsening atherosclerosis. Those undergoing anti-cancer therapy are at theoretically increased susceptibility for infection, with type of cancer not necessarily dictating outcome. A review of the literature of patients with cardiovascular and/or cancer disease is presented, as well as proposed strategies to attenuate risk regarding treatment, management, and surveillance in this vulnerable population.","Asokan, Ishan; Rabadia, Soniya V; Yang, Eric H",Curr Oncol Rep,,583

Early epidemiological indications were of a zoonotic origin: many of the initial patients confirmed contact with a local wet market and the genomic sequencing showed similar characteristics with coronaviruses known to be carried by bats. The theory of subsequent human to human transmission became evident once global epidemiological reporting of COVID infection was established. Confirmation of the origins of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 was enabled by the early sharing of the initial genomic sequence by China in January 2020 and since developed collaboratively on a globally accessible database, supported by the World Health Organization (https://tinyurl.com/rj32fp3).","Phillis, Alison",Br J Community Nurs,,583

Using immunophenotyping, RNA sequencing, and serum cytokine analysis, we analyzed serial samples from 207 SARS-CoV2-infected individuals with a range of disease severities over 12 weeks from symptom onset. An early robust bystander CD8+ T cell immune response, without systemic inflammation, characterized asymptomatic or mild disease. Hospitalized individuals had delayed bystander responses and systemic inflammation that was already evident near symptom onset, indicating that immunopathology may be inevitable in some individuals. Viral load did not correlate with this early pathological response but did correlate with subsequent disease severity. Immune recovery is complex, with profound persistent cellular abnormalities in severe disease correlating with altered inflammatory responses, with signatures associated with increased oxidative phosphorylation replacing those driven by cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-6. These late immunometabolic and immune defects may have clinical implications.","Bergamaschi, Laura; Mescia, Federica; Turner, Lorinda; Hanson, Aimee L; Kotagiri, Prasanti; Dunmore, Benjamin J; Ruffieux, Hélène; De Sa, Aloka; Huhn, Oisín; Morgan, Michael D; Gerber, Pehuén Pereyra; Wills, Mark R; Baker, Stephen; Calero-Nieto, Fernando J; Doffinger, Rainer; Dougan, Gordon; Elmer, Anne; Goodfellow, Ian G; Gupta, Ravindra K; Hosmillo, Myra; Hunter, Kelvin; Kingston, Nathalie; Lehner, Paul J; Matheson, Nicholas J; Nicholson, Jeremy K; Petrunkina, Anna M; Richardson, Sylvia; Saunders, Caroline; Thaventhiran, James E D; Toonen, Erik J M; Weekes, Michael P; Göttgens, Berthold; Toshner, Mark; Hess, Christoph; Bradley, John R; Lyons, Paul A; Smith, Kenneth G C",Immunity,,583

319204,Using social media data to assess the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in China,2021,"Stereopsis provides critical information for the spatial visual perception of object form and motion. We used virtual reality as a tool to understand the role of global stereopsis in the visual perception of self-motion and spatial presence using virtual environments experienced through head-mounted displays (HMDs). Participants viewed radially expanding optic flow simulating different speeds of self-motion in depth, which generated the illusion of self-motion in depth (i.e., linear vection). Displays were viewed with the head either stationary (passive radial flow) or laterally swaying to the beat of a metronome (active conditions). Multisensory conflict was imposed in active conditions by presenting displays that either: (i) compensated for head movement (active compensation condition), or (ii) presented pure radial flow with no compensation during head movement (active no compensation condition). In Experiment 1, impairing stereopsis by anisometropic suppression in healthy participants generated declines in reported vection strength, spatial presence and severity of cybersickness. In Experiment 2, vection and presence ratings were compared between participants with and without clinically-defined global stereopsis. Participants without global stereopsis generated impaired vection and presence similarly to those found in Experiment 1 by subjects with induced stereopsis impairment. We find that reducing global stereopsis can have benefits of reducing cybersickness, but has adverse effects on aspects of self-motion perception in HMD VR.","Luu, Wilson; Zangerl, Barbara; Kalloniatis, Michael; Kim, Juno",Sci Rep,,583

The protection provided by N95 particulate respirator masks is dependent on the filter's efficiency and seal quality. In this prospective randomised crossover study, we conducted the user seal check and the quantitative fit test on two readily available duckbill models of N95 masks, the Halyard Fluidshield® N95 (Halyard, Alpharetta, GA, USA) and the BSN Medical ProShield® N-95 (BSN Medical, Mount Waverley, Victoria) particulate respirator masks. We recruited a total of 96 anaesthetic staff, of whom 26% were of South-East Asian ethnicity. We found that both types of masks provided reasonably high fit test pass rates among our participants and there was no significant difference between the two brands (77% for the Fluidshield and 65% for the ProShield, P = 0.916). Ninety-two percent of the participants could find at least one well-fitted mask among these two types of masks. We also demonstrated that the user seal check had low accuracy and low concordance (kappa coefficient of 0.16 for the Fluidshield and 0.08 for the ProShield) when compared to the quantitative fit test, and hence was not a reliable method to test seal quality.","Williams, Daryl L; Kave, Benjamin; Lee, Keat; Segal, Reny; Krieser, Roni B; Mezzavia, Paul M; Ng, Irene",Anaesth Intensive Care,,583

In response, centers are increasingly treating selected patients with intermediate-dose prophylactic or even therapeutic dose anticoagulation in order to prevent potentially catastrophic thrombotic complications. With this changing practice, the authors suspect that inpatient gastrointestinal consult teams across the country will be frequently managing COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). In order to reduce potentially avoidable hospital readmissions for GIB while improving patient outcomes, it is imperative to appropriately risk-stratify patients prior to initiation of anticoagulation. In this review, we discuss how to appropriately identify high-risk patients for GIB and how to mitigate GIB risk with proton-pump inhibitor co-therapy, medication reconciliation, and Helicobacter pylori testing and treating in this complex and morbid population.","Patel, Parita; Sengupta, Neil",Dig Dis Sci,,583

We formulate the investing problem as a portfolio choice problem under a time-varying risk capacity constraint. We derive the optimal investment strategy under the specific condition on model parameters in terms of second-order ordinary differential equations. We demonstrate an endogenous number that measures the expected value to sustain the spending post-retirement. The optimal portfolio is nearly neutral to the stock market movement if the portfolio's value is higher than this number; but, if the portfolio is not worth enough to sustain the retirement spending, the retiree actively invests in the stock market for the higher expected return. Besides, we solve an optimal portfolio choice problem under a leverage constraint and show that the optimal portfolio would lose significantly in stressed markets. This paper shows that the time-varying risk capacity constraint has important implications for asset allocation in retirement.","Tian, Weidong; Zhu, Zimu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13741v2.pdf,583

320973,Correlates of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders symptom severity during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Since their identification as a unique cell population, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have revolutionized our understanding of immune responses, leaving their impact on multiple inflammatory and fibrotic pathologies without doubt. Thus, a tightly controlled regulation of local ILC numbers and their activity is of crucial importance. Even though this has been extensively studied in murine ILCs in the last few years, our knowledge of human ILCs is still lagging behind. Our review article will therefore summarize recent insights into the function of human ILCs and will particularly focus on their regulation under inflammatory conditions. The quality and intensity of ILC involvement into local immune responses at mucosal sites of the human body can potentially be modulated via three different axes: (1) activation of tissue-resident mature ILCs, (2) plasticity and local transdifferentiation of specific ILC subsets, and (3) tissue migration and accumulation of peripheral ILCs.

However, little is known about the timing of measures' implementation, scope, and duration in relation to their impact. The study aimed to describe the social distancing measures implemented by Brazil's states and the Federal District, including the types of measures and the timing of their implementation. This is a descriptive study of the measures' type, chronological and epidemiological timing of the implementation, and scope. The survey of measures used searches in official websites of the government departments and each state's Government Register. The official number of COVID-19 cases and deaths were obtained from an official a data platform. We considered the following categories of social distancing measures: suspension of events, school closure, quarantine of risk groups, economic lockdown (partial or full), restrictions on transportation, and quarantine of the population. The implementation's timing considered both the chronological date and the epidemiological timing, based on the time since the 10th case or 1st death from COVID-19 in each state. All the states implemented distancing measures, mostly during the latter half of March 2020. Economic lockdown was implemented early, prior to the 10th case by 67% of the states and prior to the 1st death from COVID-19 by 89% of the states. Early social distancing measures were widely implemented in Brazil, before or in the initial phase of the exponential growth curve of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the great majority of states.","Silva, Lara Lívia Santos da; Lima, Alex Felipe Rodrigues; Polli, Démerson André; Razia, Paulo Fellipe Silvério; Pavão, Luis Felipe Alvim; Cavalcanti, Marco Antônio Freitas de Hollanda; Toscano, Cristiana Maria",Cad Saude Publica,,583

322299,Factors influencing vaccination coverage among children age 12-23 months in Afghanistan: Analysis of the 2015 Demographic and Health Survey,2020,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has created a sense of global panic and the medical community started to search for rapid answers. Pharmaceuticals and research labs across the world are racing to find vaccines and treatments for the new coronavirus, using a variety of different technological ways. With Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is observed that asymptomatic symptoms turn out to be severe and fatal. By raising pyrexia, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failure are observed to develop which are not only associated with coronavirus. The treatment of the virus and the systemic inflammatory response it causes are also very important. The rapid response to infection has been well defined and comprises a complex interaction of cytokine storm, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and pathologic coagulation. Since the effective therapies are missing and immunological treatments may be deficient, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), by reason of their potent immunomodulatory ability, can have useful results in order to prevent the cytokine storm and reduce morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. The aim of this article is to discuss the potential effect of MSCs types in COVID-19 infection without definite treatment.","Yildiz Gülhan, Pinar",Tuberk Toraks,,583
322433,Using cloud technology in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Statins have known pleiotropic effects that confer protection from ischemia-reperfusion injury. Because cardiopulmonary bypass is a potentially reversible ischemia-reperfusion sequence, we aimed to assess whether statin loading could help to limit myocardial injury in patients undergoing isolated heart valve replacement under cardiopulmonary bypass. METHODS: One hundred patients with rheumatic valvular heart disease undergoing valve replacement received either a loading dose of rosuvastatin (40 mg initiated 7 days before surgery; loaded group) or no statins (non-loaded group). Cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase MB, and brain natriuretic peptide were measured at 8, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the extent of perioperative myocardial injury measured by the area under the curve for each biomarker. RESULTS: Despite similar baseline levels, all biomarkers at 8, 24, and 48 h were significantly lower in the loaded group. The area under the curve of each biomarker was significantly lower in the loaded group than in the non-loaded group (troponin I: 31.43 vs. 77.21 ng·h·mL-1, creatine kinase MB 309.31 vs. 429.12 ng·h·mL-1, brain natriuretic peptide 5176.11 vs. 16119.31 pg·h·mL-1, all p < 0.001). The mean changes from baseline to peak levels were also significantly lower in the loaded group. The loaded group had a shorter hospital stay but no significant difference was seen in ventilator time, inotrope time, aortic crossclamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, or intensive care unit stay. CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing valve replacement, high-dose statin loading before surgery had a favorable impact on the release kinetics of various cardiac biomarkers.","Kaushik, Atul; Kapoor, Aditya; Agarwal, Surendra Kumar; Pande, Shantanu; Kashyap, Shiridhar; Sinha, Archana; Khanna, Roopali; Kumar, Sudeep; Garg, Naveen; Tewari, Satyendra; Goel, Pravin K",Asian Cardiovasc Thorac Ann,,583
322434,Using cloud technology in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"This work assesses the potential of new water cluster-based ion beams for improving the capabilities of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) for in situ lipidomics. The effect of water clusters was compared to carbon dioxide clusters, along with the effect of using pure water clusters compared to mixed water and carbon dioxide clusters. A signal increase was found when using pure water clusters. However, when analyzing cells, a more substantial signal increase was found in positive ion mode when the water clusters also contained carbon dioxide, suggesting that additional reactions are in play. The effects of using a water primary ion beam on a more complex sample were investigated by analyzing brain tissue from an Alzheimer's disease transgenic mouse model. The results indicate that the ToF-SIMS results are approaching those from MALDI as ToF-SIMS was able to image lyso-phosphocholine (LPC) lipids, a lipid class that for a long time has eluded detection during SIMS analyses.

322752,An Overview of Human Resources and Capacity in Health Care Institutions in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Context of Responding to the COVID 19 Pandemic,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants are emerging around the globe. Unfortunately, several SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially, variants of concern (VOC) are less susceptible to neutralization by the convalescent and post-vaccination sera, raising concerns of increased disease transmissibility and severity. Recent data suggests the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing anti-body levels as a good correlate of vaccine mediated protection. However, currently used BSL3 based virus micro-neutralization (MN) assays are more laborious, time consuming and expensive, underscoring the need for BSL2 based, cost effective neutralization assays against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In light of this unmet need, we have developed a BSL2 pseudovirus based neutralization assay (PBNA) in cells expressing Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The assay is reproducible (R2=0.96), demonstrates a good dynamic range and high sensitivity. Our data suggests that the biological Anti-SARS-CoV-2 research reagents such as NIBSC 20/130 show lower neutralization against B.1.351 RSA and B1.1.7 UK VOC, whereas a commercially available monoclonal antibody MM43 retains activity against both these variants. SARS-CoV-2 Spike Pseudovirus based neutralization assays for VOC would be useful tools to measure the neutralization ability of candidate vaccines in both preclinical models and clinical trials and further help develop effective prophylactic countermeasures against emerging neutralization escape phenotypes.","Kalkeri, Raj; Cai, Zhaohui; Lin, Shuling; Farmer, John; Kuzmichev, Yury V; Koide, Fusataka",,,583

Despite sharing a similar etiology, COVID-19 patients present different patterns from asymptomatic to severely hypoxemic patients. In some patients, patterns of multiorgan failure have been observed similarly to patients with bacterial sepsis. This review aimed to analyze the currently available data on the treatment of COVID-19, specifically the most studied antiviral agents and therapies targeting the immune system including those that have been investigated in sepsis. RECENT FINDINGS: In the last months, several trials have been conducted worldwide to try to identify optimal antiviral treatments against COVID-19. Antiviral agents such as lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine have been investigated as well as specific and non-specific immunomodulators in order to determine their potential efficacy against SARS-Cov2. SUMMARY: To date, the vast majority of the studied antiviral and immunomodulatory agents have failed to improve outcomes of patients with COVID-19 except for dexamethasone. Many other trials are currently underway with new antiviral agents and various immunomodulatory agents with potential clinical benefit for COVID-19 patients. Despite these emerging data, robust controlled clinical trials assessing patient-centered outcomes remain imperative.","Roger, Claire",Curr. opin. anaesthesiol,,583

Moreover, influenza-related respiratory illnesses may increase the risk of adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Thus, this study examines the mechanisms involved in influenza vaccination uptake. Specifically, this study investigates how health information sources are associated with perceived vaccine efficacy and safety, which, in turn, associated with influenza vaccine uptake. Analyzing cross-sectional survey data from a national U.S. adult sample (N = 19,420), mediation analyses were conducted. Results revealed that considering vaccine efficacy, health information seekers who assigned more value to medical professionals, medical journals, and newspaper articles were more likely to perceive a vaccine as effective, thus being more likely to receive the influenza vaccine. By contrast, individuals who placed more value in social media were less likely to perceive vaccine efficacy, and, in turn, were less likely to get the influenza vaccine. Turning to vaccine safety, the value ascribed to medical professionals was positively associated with vaccine safety, which, in turn, related to influenza vaccine uptake. By contrast, social media, family or friends, and promotions were negatively associated with vaccine safety, and then influenza vaccine uptake.","Hwang, Juwon",J Health Commun,,583

They had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 47.0 (38.0-70.3) years, and 16 (38.1%) were men. Patients with ketosis were younger (median age 47.0 vs. 58.0 years; P = 0.003) and had a greater prevalence of fatigue (31.0% vs. 10.6%; P < 0.001), diabetes (35.7% vs. 18.5%; P = 0.007) and digestive disorders (31.0% vs. 12.0%; P < 0.001). They had a longer median (IQR) length of hospital stay (19.0 [12.8-33.3] vs. 16.0 [10.0-24.0] days; P < 0.001) and a higher mortality rate (21.4% vs. 8.9%; P = 0.017).

Two (7.4%) and four (14.3%) of the 27 non-diabetic ketotic patients developed severe acidosis and died, respectively, and one (25.0%) of these presented with acidosis. This suggests that COVID-19 infection caused ketosis or ketoacidosis, and induced diabetic ketoacidosis for those with diabetes. Ketosis increased the length of hospital stay and mortality. Meanwhile, diabetes increased the length of hospital stay for patients with ketosis but had no effect on their mortality.","Li, Juyi; Wang, Xiufang; Chen, Jian; Zuo, Xiuran; Zhang, Hongmei; Deng, Aiping",Diabetes obes. metab,,583

In elderly individuals and those with comorbidities, COVID-19 is associated with high mortality, frequently caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome. We examine in situ expression of SARS-CoV-2 in airways and lung obtained at autopsy of individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Seven autopsy cases (male, N = 5; female, N = 2) with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and a median age of 66 years (range, 50-77 years) were evaluated using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against SARS Nucleocapsid protein in correlation with clinical parameters. The median time from symptom onset to death was 9 days (range, 6-31 days), from hospitalization 7 days (range, 1-21 days), from positive RT-PCR 7 days (range, 0-18 days), and from intensive care unit admission defining onset of respiratory failure 3 days (range, 1-18 days). Chest imaging identified diffuse airspace disease in all patients corresponding to acute and (N = 5) or organizing (N = 2) diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) on histologic examination. Among five patients with acute-phase DAD (&#8804;7 days from onset of respiratory failure), SARS-CoV-2 was detected in pulmonary pneumocytes and ciliated airway cells (N = 5), and in upper airway epithelium (N = 2). In two patients with organizing DAD (>14 days from onset of respiratory failure), no virus was detected in lungs or airways. No endothelial cell infection was observed. The findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells in lungs and airways of patients with COVID-19 who developed respiratory failure can be detected during the acute phase of lung injury and is absent in the organizing phase.","Schaefer, Inga-Marie; Padera, Robert F; Solomon, Isaac H; Kanjilal, Sanjat; Hammer, Mark M; Hornick, Jason L; Sholl, Lynette M",Mod. pathol,,583

To support WHO with their recommendations on quarantine, we conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine during severe coronavirus outbreaks. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a rapid review to assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in regions with high transmission of the disease. SEARCH METHODS: An information specialist searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 12 February 2020 and updated the search on 12 March 2020. WHO provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases up to 16 March 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Cohort studies, case-control-studies, case series, time series, interrupted time series, and mathematical modelling studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID-19. We also included studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as indirect evidence for the current coronavirus outbreak. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened 30% of records; a single review author screened the remaining 70%. Two review authors screened all potentially relevant full-text publications independently. One review author extracted data and assessed evidence quality with GRADE and a second review author checked the assessment. We rated the certainty of evidence for the four primary outcomes: incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and resource use. MAIN RESULTS: We included 29 studies; 10 modelling studies on COVID-19, four observational studies and 15 modelling studies on SARS and MERS. Because of the diverse methods of measurement and analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a meta-analysis and conducted a narrative synthesis. Due to the type of evidence found for this review, GRADE rates the certainty of the evidence as low to very low. Modeling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases averted 44% to 81% incident cases and 31% to 63% of deaths compared to no measures based on different scenarios (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS, low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence suggests that the earlier quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings (2 modelling studies on SARS). Very low-certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and deaths was small (2 modelling studies on SARS). When the models combined quarantine with other prevention and control measures, including school closures, travel restrictions and social distancing, the models demonstrated a larger effect on the reduction of new cases, transmissions and deaths than individual measures alone (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID-19; onward transmission: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19; low-certainty evidence). Studies on SARS and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on COVID-19. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence for COVID-19 is limited to modelling studies that make parameter assumptions based on the current, fragmented knowledge. Findings consistently indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure effectiveness. In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures implemented. Testing in representative samples in different settings could help assess the true prevalence of infection, and would reduce uncertainty of modelling assumptions.

In this work, IoT based wearable monitoring device is designed to measure various vital signs related to COVID-19. Moreover, the system automatically alerts the concerned medical authorities about any violations of quarantine for potentially infected patients by monitoring their real time GPS data. The wearable sensor placed on the body is connected to edge node in IoT cloud where the data is processed and analyzed to define the state of health condition. The proposed system is implemented with three layered functionalities as wearable IoT sensor layer, cloud layer with Application Peripheral Interface (API) and Android web layer for mobile phones. Each layer has individual functionality, first the data is measured from IoT sensor layer to define the health symptoms. The next layer is used to store the information in the cloud database for preventive measures, alerts, and immediate actions. The Android mobile application layer is responsible for providing notifications and alerts for the potentially infected patient family respondents. The integrated system has both API and mobile application synchronized with each other for predicting and alarming the situation. The design serves as an essential platform that defines the measured readings of COVID-19 symptoms for monitoring, management, and analysis. Furthermore, the work disseminates how digital remote platform as wearable device can be used as a monitoring device to track the health and recovery of a COVID-19 patient.","Al Bassam, Nizar; Shaik Asif, Hussain; Al Qaraghuli, Ammar; Khan, Jibreal; Sumesh, E P; Lavanya, Vidhya",Inform Med Unlocked,,583

METHODS: The case of a man with SARS-CoV-2 infection and complicated acute otitis media with facial paralysis is presented to illustrate unique clinical decisions made in context of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cadaveric temporal bone was used to simulate droplet spread during suctioning of fluorescein-labelled middle ear fluid and visualized with a blue-light filter. RESULTS: A 23-year-old male who presented with complicated acute otitis media with facial paralysis was found to have an acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, with positive viral PCR of nasopharyngeal swab, and a negative PCR of the middle ear fluid. He was placed on isolation precautions and treated with myringotomy, topical and systemic antibiotics, and antivirals. Consistent with observations during endonasal suctioning, suctioning of middle ear fluid was not found to be aerosol or droplet generating. CONCLUSION: The case of a patient with active COVID-19 presenting with complicated acute otitis media in whom middle ear fluid was sampled to evaluate the etiology of the infection and the potential middle ear predilection of SARS-CoV-2 is described. This study has implications for the clinical management of patients with both known and unknown SARS-CoV-2 infection who present with ear disease. While middle ear suctioning may not be aerosol-generating, the risk of coughing or prolonged close contact requires heightened precautions during otologic procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.","Mohan, Suresh; Workman, Alan; Barshak, Miriam; Welling, D Bradley; Abdul-Aziz, Dunia",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,,583

RECENT FINDINGS: Headache, dizziness, excessive tiredness, myalgia, anosmia/hyposmia, and ageusia/dysgeusia are common nonspecific neurological manifestations during early COVID-19 disease found in the majority of patients. Less frequent but more severe and specific neurological manifestations include Guillain--Barré syndrome, encephalopathy, encephalitis/meningitis, epileptic seizures, and cerebrovascular events. Beyond standard neurological examination, these require a more extensive work-up, including cerebrospinal fluid assessment, neurophysiological evaluation, neuroimaging, and cognitive testing. Symptomatic treatment is advisable unless the neurological complication's immune pathogenesis is proven. SUMMARY: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 occur during the acute, para-infectious, and 'recovery' phase.

Methods: The clinical data and chest CT images of 105 cases with confirmed COVID-19 (55 males and 50 females, aged from 2 month to 88 years) and 97 cases with suspected COVID-19 (59 males and 38 females, aged from 1 month to 93 years) were analyzed retrospectively in Shiyan Taihe Hospital from January 21 to February 10, 2020. χ2test and two independent sample t test were used to analyze the clinical data and CT signs of the two group cases, with P&lt;0.05 for statistically significant difference. Results: Compared with the suspected patients, the average age of confirmed ones was higher (t=2.460, P=0.01). The main pathological changes were pure ground glass (68 cases) and mixed ground glass density (53 cases) (χ2=50.016, P&lt;0.01). Interstitial thickening (83 cases) (χ2=55.395, P&lt;0.01), vascular widening (73 cases) (χ2=57.527, P&lt;0.01), air bronchogram sign or bronchiectasis (67 cases) (χ2=17.899, P&lt;0.01), fibrous streak shadow (54 cases) (χ2=5.500, P=0.02), commonly distributed under the pleura and the long axis of the lesion was parallel to the pleura (89 cases) (χ2=23.597, P&lt;0.01), most of them had no pleural effusion (χ2= 7.017, P&lt;0.01); both lesions were mainly distributed in patches (89 confirmed cases, 87 suspected cases) (χ2=19.573, P&lt; 0.01). In addition, the lesions of patients with confirmed COVID-19 showed progress in short term (72/87, 82.76%), and those with suspected COVID-19 showed remission in short term (63/89, 70.78%). The difference was statistically significant (χ2=51.114, P&lt; 0.01). There was no significant difference in gender and distribution of pulmonary lobes (χ2=1.462, P=0.23; χ2= 7.381, P=0.19).

331969,Mental health in conditions of covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Antifungal prophylaxis during induction for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) varies according to local rates of invasive fungal infections (IFIs). We evaluated fluconazole prophylaxis and no antifungal prophylaxis, as a natural interrupted time-series study to assess survival and infection complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified patients with AML &#8805; 18 years old undergoing induction chemotherapy during 2 time periods: period 1, fluconazole prophylaxis from August 1, 2013 to September 30, 2015, and period 2, no prophylaxis from October 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017. The primary outcome was incidence of proven or probable IFI. Secondary outcomes included types of IFIs and 60-day overall survival (OS). IFI was defined by the 2002 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group Consensus criteria. RESULTS: One hundred forty-four patients received induction chemotherapy over the 2 time periods. In the prophylaxis versus no-prophylaxis groups, the rate of proven or probable IFIs was 4 (5%) of 87 versus 12 (21%) of 57 (P = .01). The total number of proven IFIs was 3 (3%) of 87 versus 4 (7%) of 57 (P = .44), whereas probable IFIs were 1 (1%) of 87 versus 8 (14%) of 57 (P < .01). No difference was observed in fungemia. Incidence of IFIs was too low to detect resistance patterns. OS at 60 days was improved in with fluconazole prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis (hazard ratio, 0.329; 95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.89; P = .028). CONCLUSION: Observed rates of proven or probable IFI were lower in the fluconazole prophylaxis group versus the no-prophylaxis group. Sixty-day OS was higher with fluconazole prophylaxis. Further study is required to evaluate how fluconazole may impart the differences in survival seen in this analysis.","Signorelli, Jessie; Lei, Matthew; Lam, Jenna; Jalbut, Marla; Amrein, Philip C; Fathi, Amir T; Hobbs, Gabriela; Hock, Hanno; McAfee, Steven Lawrence; Letourneau, Alyssa R; Narayan, Rupa; Brunner, Andrew",Clin. lymphoma myeloma leuk.

332698,Caring for the Most Vulnerable: A Model for Managing Maladaptive Behavior in Children with Mental Special Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Viroporins are oligomeric, pore forming, viral proteins that play critical roles in the life cycle of pathogenic viruses. Viroporins like HIV-1 Vpu, Alphavirus 6 K, Influenza M2, HCV p7, and Picornavirus 2B, form discrete aqueous passageways which mediate ion and small molecule transport in infected cells. The alterations in host membrane structures induced by viroporins is essential for key steps in the virus life cycle like entry, replication and egress. Any disruption in viroporin functionality severely compromises viral pathogenesis. The envelope (E) protein encoded by coronaviruses is a viroporin with ion channel activity and has been shown to be crucial for the assembly and pathophysiology of coronaviruses. We used a combination of virtual database screening, molecular docking, all-atom molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA analysis to test four FDA approved drugs - Tretinoin, Mefenamic Acid, Ondansetron and Artemether - as potential inhibitors of ion channels formed by SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Interaction and binding energy analysis showed that electrostatic interactions and polar solvation energy were the major driving forces for binding of the drugs, with Tretinoin being the most promising inhibitor. Tretinoin bound within the lumen of the channel formed by E protein, which is lined by hydrophobic residues like Phe, Val and Ala, indicating its potential for blocking the channel and inhibiting the viroporin functionality of E. In control simulations, tretinoin demonstrated a lower binding energy with a known target as compared to SARS-CoV-2 E protein. This work thus highlights the possibility of exploring Tretinoin as a potential SARS-CoV-2 E protein ion channel blocker and virus assembly inhibitor, which could be an important therapeutic strategy in the treatment for coronaviruses.","Dey, Debajit; Borkotoky, Subhomoi; Banerjee, Manidipa",Comput Biol Med,,583

333173,Using Telemedicine to Reach Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 novel coronavirus closed oral health care in Nova Scotia (NS) Canada in March 2020. Preparing for a phased reopening, a knowledge exchange coalition (representing government, academia, hospitals, oral health professions, and regulators) developed return-to-work (RTW) guidelines detailing the augmentation of standard practices to ensure safety for patients, oral health care providers (OHPs), and the community. Using online surveys, this study explored the influence of the RTW guidelines and related education on registered NS OHPs during a phased return to work. METHODS: Dissemination of R2W guidelines included website or email communiques and interdisciplinary education webinars that coincided with 2 RTW phases approved by the government. Aligned with each phase, all registered dentists, dental hygienists, and dental assistants were invited to complete an online survey to gauge the influence of the coalition-sponsored education and RTW guidelines, confidence, preparedness, and personal protective equipment use before and after the pandemic. RESULTS: Three coalition-sponsored multidisciplinary webinars hosted 3541 attendees prior to RTW. The response to survey 1 was 41% (881/2156) and to survey 2 was 26% (571/2177) of registrants. Survey 1 (82%) and survey 2 (89%) respondents ""agreed/strongly agreed"" that R2W guidelines were a primary source for guiding return to practice, and most were confident with education received and had the skills needed to effectively treat patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Confidence and preparedness improved in survey 2. Gowns/lab coat use for aerosol-generating procedures increased from 26% to 93%, and the use of full face shields rose from 6% to 93% during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: A multistakeholder coalition was effective in establishing and communicating comprehensive guidelines and web-based education to ensure unified reintegration of oral health services in NS during a pandemic. This multiorganizational cooperation lay the foundation for responses to subsequent waves of COVID-19 and may serve as an example for collaboratively responding to future public health threats in other settings.

333305,Resident Mental Health at the Epicenter of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Water is an essential resource required for various human activities such as drinking, cooking, and other recreational activities. While developed nations have made significant improvement in providing adequate quality water and sanitation devoid of virus contaminations to a significant percentage of the residences, many of the developing countries are still lacking in these regards, leading to many death cases among the vulnerable due to ingestion of virus-contaminated water and other waterborne pathogens. However, the recent global pandemic of COVID-19 seems to have changed the paradigm by reawakening the importance of water quality and sanitation, and focusing more attention on the pervasive effect of the use of virus-contaminated water as it can be a potential driver for the spread of the virus and other waterborne diseases, especially in developing nations that are characterized by low socioeconomic development. Therefore, this review assessed the socioeconomic inequalities related to the usage of virus-contaminated water and other waterborne pathogens in developing countries. The socioeconomic factors attributed to the various waterborne diseases due to the use of virus-contaminated water in many developing countries are poverty, the standard of living, access to health care facilities, age, gender, and level of education. Some mitigation strategies to address the viral contamination of water sources are therefore proposed, while future scope and recommendations on tackling the essential issues related to socioeconomic inequality in developing nations are highlighted.","Adelodun, Bashir; Ajibade, Fidelis Odedishemi; Ighalo, Joshua O; Odey, Golden; Ibrahim, Rahmat Gbemisola; Kareem, Kola Yusuff; Bakare, Hashim Olalekan; Tiamiyu, AbdulGafar Olatunji; Ajibade, Temitope F; Abdulkadir, Taofeeq Sholagberu; Adeniran, Kamoru Akanni; Choi, Kyung Sook",Environ Res,,583

Most recently, studies on confirmed COVID-19 cases have suggested that mortality might be due to virally induced hyperinflammation. Uncontrolled pro-inflammatory states are often driven by continuous positive feedback loops between pro-inflammatory signaling and oxidative stress, which cannot be resolved in a targeted manner. Here, we report on the development of multidrug nanoparticles for the mitigation of uncontrolled inflammation. The nanoparticles are made by conjugating squalene, a natural lipid, to adenosine, an endogenous immunomodulator, and then encapsulating &#945;-tocopherol, as antioxidant. This resulted in high drug loading, biocompatible, multidrug nanoparticles. By exploiting the endothelial dysfunction at sites of acute inflammation, these multidrug nanoparticles delivered the therapeutic agents in a targeted manner, conferring survival advantage to treated animals in models of endotoxemia. Selectively delivering adenosine and antioxidants together could serve as a novel therapeutic approach for safe treatment of acute paradoxal inflammation.","Dormont, Flavio; Brusini, Romain; Cailleau, Catherine; Reynaud, Franceline; Peramo, Arnaud; Gendron, Amandine; Mougin, Julie; Gaudin, Françoise; Varna, Mariana; Couvreur, Patrick",Sci Adv,,583

The WHO's EDRM Framework was used for reviewing the Belgian Public health emergency preparedness and responses in the context of COVID-19. Information on the measures taken was collected through the literature review including all government's communication, reports, and scientific papers. All epidemic data were extracted from a national open database managed and published by the Sciensano. Additionally, two authors closely followed the Belgian situation since the beginning of the pandemic and updated the data every day. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the anti-epidemic strategy was mainly to avoid medical resources exceeding the upper limit. Belgium issued a series of emergency decrees to limit the spread of the virus. An existing structure of ""federal-region-municipal"" as the framework of public health emergency preparedness and response was adapted. The emergency response process in Belgium was divided into four phases: information-evaluation-coordination-decision-making at the region level and the final decision-making at the federal level. Belgium also implemented a phased plan in the process of setting up and lifting the lockdown. However, it was vulnerable in early response, due to the shortage of medical equipment supplies in general, and more particularly for the long term care facilities (LTCFs). Belgium has achieved an intensive cooperation between stakeholders based on an existing multisectoral emergency organization framework. Legislation, medical insurance, and good communication also played a role in limiting the spread of viruses. However, the authorities underestimated the risk of an epidemic and did not take quarantine measures among people suspected affected by SARS-COV-2 in the early stages, resulting in insufficient medical equipment supply and a large number of deaths in the LTCF. The implementation of the lockdown measure in Belgium also encountered obstacles. The lockdown and its exit strategy were both closely related to the pandemic situation and social and economic life. The authorities should strengthen information management, improve the public awareness of the measures, and find out the balance points between the social and economic life and infection control measures.","He, Rongxin; Zhang, Jun; Mao, Ying; Degomme, Olivier; Zhang, Wei-Hong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,583
335466,Age alone is not adequate to determine health-care resource allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease is a general concern for the development of vaccines and antibody therapies because the mechanisms that underlie antibody protection against any virus have a theoretical potential to amplify the infection or trigger harmful immunopathology. This possibility requires careful consideration at this critical point in the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we review observations relevant to the risks of ADE of disease, and their potential implications for SARS-CoV-2 infection. At present, there are no known clinical findings, immunological assays or biomarkers that can differentiate any severe viral infection from immune-enhanced disease, whether by measuring antibodies, T cells or intrinsic host responses. In vitro systems and animal models do not predict the risk of ADE of disease, in part because protective and potentially detrimental antibody-mediated mechanisms are the same and designing animal models depends on understanding how antiviral host responses may become harmful in humans. The implications of our lack of knowledge are twofold. First, comprehensive studies are urgently needed to define clinical correlates of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Second, because ADE of disease cannot be reliably predicted after either vaccination or treatment with antibodies-regardless of what virus is the causative agent-it will be essential to depend on careful analysis of safety in humans as immune interventions for COVID-19 move forward.","Arvin, Ann M; Fink, Katja; Schmid, Michael A; Cathcart, Andrea; Spreafico, Roberto; Havenar-Daughton, Colin; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Corti, Davide; Virgin, Herbert W",Nature,,583

The BMSC-sEV was isolated by Exosome Isolation&#8482; reagent and identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and western blotting (WB). The human periodontal stem cells (hPDLCs) were co-cultured with BMSC-sEV in vitro to detect the effects of BMSC-sEV on hPDLCs migration, proliferation and differentiation. The BMSC-sEV loaded by hydrogel was injected into experimental periodontitis rats to verify the therapeutic effect and possible mechanism. The results showed that BMSC-sEV was 30-150 nm vesicles and expressed the exosomes protein CD63 and tumor susceptibility 101 (TSG101), which could promote the migration, proliferation, osteogenic differentiation of hPDLCs. The BMSC-sEV-hydrogel had a therapeutic effect on periodontitis rats. After administration for four to eight weeks, micro-CT and histological analysis showed the alveolar bone loss (ABL), inflammatory infiltration and collagen destruction in BMSC-sEV-hydrogel group were less than that in PBS-hydrogel group and periodontitis group. The further immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining revealed that the number of Trap positive cells and the expression ratio of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor-activator of nuclear factor kappa beta ligand (RANKL) in BMSC-sEV-hydrogel group were lower than that in PBS-hydrogel group and periodontitis group, while the expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-ß1) and the ratio of macrophages type 2 and macrophages type 1(M2/M1) were opposite. Therefore, BMSC-sEV can promote the regeneration of periodontal tissues, and that may be partly due to BMSC-sEV involve in the OPG-RANKL-RANK signaling pathway to regulate the function of osteoclasts and affect the macrophages polarization and TGF-ß1 expression to modulate the inflammatory immune response, thereby inhibiting the development of periodontitis and immune damage of periodontal tissue.","Liu, Li; Guo, Shujuan; Shi, Weiwei; Liu, Qian; Huo, Fangjun; Wu, Yafei; Tian, Weidong",Tissue engineering.

343055,Older Adults' Risk Perception during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Lombardy Region of Italy: A Cross-sectional Survey,2021,"BACKGROUND: We need an effective treatment to cure COVID-19 patients and to decrease virus carriage duration. METHODS: We conducted an uncontrolled, non-comparative, observational study in a cohort of 80 relatively mildly infected inpatients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of at least three days, with three main measurements: clinical outcome, contagiousness as assessed by PCR and culture, and length of stay in infectious disease unit (IDU). RESULTS: All patients improved clinically except one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74 year-old patient still in intensive care. A rapid fall of nasopharyngeal viral load was noted, with 83% negative at Day7, and 93% at Day8. Virus cultures from patient respiratory samples were negative in 97.5% of patients at Day5. Consequently patients were able to be rapidly discharged from IDU with a mean length of stay of five days. CONCLUSION: We believe there is urgency to evaluate the effectiveness of this potentially-life saving therapeutic strategy at a larger scale, both to treat and cure patients at an early stage before irreversible severe respiratory complications take hold and to decrease duration of carriage and avoid the spread of the disease. Furthermore, the cost of treatment is negligible.","Gautret, Philippe; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Parola, Philippe; Hoang, Van Thuan; Meddeb, Line; Sevestre, Jacques; Mailhe, Morgane; Doudier, Barbara; Aubry, Camille; Amrane, Sophie; Seng, Piseth; Hocquart, Marie; Eldin, Carole; Finance, Julie; Vieira, Vera Esteves; Tissot-Dupont, Hervé Tissot; Honoré, Stéphane; Stein, Andreas; Million, Matthieu; Colson, Philippe; La Scola, Bernard; Veit, Véronique; Jacquier, Alexis; Deharo, Jean-Claude; Drancourt, Michel; Fournier, Pierre Edouard; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Brouqui, Philippe; Raoult, Didier",Travel Med Infect Dis,,583

METHODS: A total of 4262 women with T1-2N1M0 breast cancer treated at two institutions were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 3858 patients underwent MRM, and 832 (21.6%) of them received postoperative RT (MRM + RT). A total of 404 patients received BCS plus postoperative RT (BCS + RT). All patients received axillary lymph node dissection, while 3.8% of them had upfront sentinel node biopsy. The association of survival outcomes with different surgical modalities (BCS vs. MRM) and the role of RT were evaluated using multivariable proportional hazards regression and confirmed by the propensity score-matching (PSM) method. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 71 months (range of 6-230 months), the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of the BCS and MRM groups were 96.5 and 92.7%, respectively (P = .001), and the corresponding 5-year disease-free-survival (DFS) and locoregional recurrence (LRR) rates were 92.9 and 84.0%, and 2.0 and 7.0% (P = .001), respectively (P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that RT was an independent prognostic factor for improved OS (P = .001) and DFS (P = .009), and decreased LRR (P < .001). However, surgery procedure was not independently associated with either OS (P = .495), DFS (P = .204), or LRR (P = .996), which was confirmed by PSM analysis. CONCLUSION: Postoperative radiotherapy rather than the surgery procedures was associated with superior survival outcomes in patients with T1-2N1M0 breast cancer.","Sun, Guang-Yi; Wen, Ge; Zhang, Yu-Jing; Tang, Yu; Jing, Hao; Wang, Jian-Yang; Zhang, Jiang-Hu; Yang, Yong; Zhao, Xu-Ran; Chen, Si-Ye; Jin, Jing; Song, Yong-Wen; Liu, Yue-Ping; Fang, Hui; Ren, Hua; Tang, Yuan; Qi, Shu-Nan; Li, Ning; Chen, Bo; Lu, Ning-Ning; Wang, Shu-Lian; Li, Ye-Xiong",BMC Cancer,,583

Researchers foresee that such transformations will continue in the future with virtual worlds becoming an integral part of education. Until now, however, students' behaviors in immersive virtual environments have not been investigated in depth. In this work, we study students' attention by exploiting object-of-interests using eye tracking in different classroom manipulations. More specifically, we varied sitting positions of students, visualization styles of virtual avatars, and hand-raising percentages of peer-learners. Our empirical evidence shows that such manipulations play an important role in students' attention towards virtual peer-learners, instructors, and lecture material.

351816,The COVID-19 Pandemic and Rapid Implementation of Adolescent and Young Adult Telemedicine: Challenges and Opportunities for Innovation,2020,"BACKGROUND: Prior literature examining the impact of social distancing on US COVID-19 mortality predominantly examines this relationship at the national level in addition to not separating nursing home COVID-19 deaths from total COVID-19 deaths. This approach may obscure differences in social distancing behaviors by county in addition to the actual effectiveness of social distancing in preventing COVID-19 deaths. OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of county level social distancing behavior on COVID-19 mortality (deaths/100,000 people) for counties throughout the US over the timespan that stay at home orders were implemented in most US states (March 2020-May 2020). METHODS: Using social distancing data from tracked mobile phones in all US counties, we estimated the relationship between social distancing (average % of mobile phone use outside the home between March 2020-May 2020) and COVID-19 mortality (when the state a county is in had its first confirmed case and up to May 31st, 2020) with a mixed-effects negative binomial model while separating nursing home COVID-19 deaths from total COVID-19 deaths as well as accounting for social distancing and COVID-19 related factors (days between when the first confirmed case was reported and May 31st, 2020, population density, social vulnerability, and hospital resource availability). Results from the mixed-effects negative binomial model were then used to generate marginal effects at the mean which allowed for the separation of the influence of social distancing on COVID-19 deaths from other covariates while calculating COVID-19 deaths/100,000 people. RESULTS: We observed that a 1% increase in average mobile phone use outside the home between March 2020-May 2020 led to a significant increase in COVID-19 mortality by a factor of 1.18 (p < .001) while every 1% increase in average % of mobile phone use outside the home in February was found to significantly decrease COVID-19 mortality by a factor of 0.90 (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: As stay-at-home orders have been lifted in many US states, continued adherence to other social distancing measures such as avoiding large gatherings and maintaining physical distance in public are key to preventing additional COVID-19 deaths in counties across the country.","Tran, Phoebe; Tran, Lam; Tran, Liem",,,583

The Thoracic Domain of the Asian Society for Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery reports a consensus statement on the provision of thoracic cancer surgery during this pandemic. METHODS: A Thoracic Experts Panel was convened by the Society. A consensus on the provision, safety, and setting of thoracic cancer surgery during the pandemic was obtained through a Delphi process. RESULTS: Responses were received from 26 panel members (96% response rate) from 10 regions across Asia. The Society recommended that elective thoracic cancer surgery services may need to be reduced or postponed if medical resources were needed for COVID-19 patients, especially intensive care unit beds and ventilators. However, thoracic cancer surgery should proceed as normal for all solid tumors, without restrictions based on disease stage, availability of non-surgical treatment options, or patient condition (unless there is a high likelihood of postoperative intensive care unit stay). Aerosol-forming procedures should be avoided intra- and perioperatively. The surgical approach does not make a difference in terms of safety. Services for thoracic cancer patients should be offered only in hospitals that maintain isolation wards for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Services for patients with thoracic cancer should be maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic. The position of the Society is that thoracic surgeons have a responsibility to perform good surgical management of thoracic cancer during the pandemic, to advocate for patients' rights to receive it, and to safeguard patients and staff from infection.","Jheon, Sanghoon; Ahmed, Aneez Db; Fang, Vincent Wt; Jung, Woohyun; Khan, Ali Zamir; Lee, Jang-Ming; Sihoe, Alan Dl; Thongcharoen, Punnarerk; Tsuboi, Masahiro; Turna, Akif; Nakajima, Jun",Asian Cardiovasc Thorac Ann,,583

Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable with common hyperactivity of immune responses known as a ""cytokine storm"". In fact, this massive release of inflammatory cytokines into in the pulmonary alveolar structure is a main cause of mortality during COVID-19 infection. Current management of COVID-19 is supportive and there is no common clinical protocol applied to suppress this pathological state. Lactoferrin (LF), an iron binding protein, is a first line defense protein that is present in neutrophils and excretory fluids of all mammals, and is well recognized for its role in maturation and regulation of immune system function. Also, due to its ability to sequester free iron, LF is known to protect against insult-induced oxidative stress and subsequent ""cytokine storm"" that results in dramatic necrosis within the affected tissue. Review of the literature strongly suggests utility of LF to silence the ""cytokine storm"", giving credence to both prophylactic and therapeutic approaches towards combating COVID-19 infection.","Zimecki, Michal; Actor, Jeffrey K; Kruzel, Marian L",Int Immunopharmacol,,583

What was the excess mortality in Israel in 2020 and when, where and for whom was this excess? METHODS: Mortality rates between March to November 2020 for various demographic groups, cities, month and week were compared with the average rate during 2017-2019 for the same groups or periods. RESULTS: Total mortality rates for March-November were significantly higher by 6% in 2020, than the average of 2017-2019, 14% higher among the Arab population and 5% among Jews and Others. Significantly higher monthly mortality rates were found in August, September and October by 11%, 13% and 19%, respectively, among Jews and Others, and by 19%, 64% and 40% in the Arab population. Excess mortality was significant only at older ages, 7% higher rates at ages 65-74 and 75-84 and 8% at ages 85 and above, and greater for males than females in all ages and population groups. Interestingly, mortality rates decreased significantly among the younger population aged under 25. The cities with most significant excess mortality were Ramla (25% higher), Bene Beraq (24%), Bat Yam (15%) and Jerusalem (8%). CONCLUSION: Israel has seen significant excess mortality in August-October 2020, particularly in the Arab sector. The excess mortality in March-November was statistically significant only at older ages, over 65. It is very important to protect this susceptible population from exposure and prioritize them for inoculations. Lockdowns were successful in lowering the excess mortality. The excess mortality is similar to official data on COVID-19 deaths.","Haklai, Ziona; Aburbeh, Miriam; Goldberger, Nehama; Gordon, Ethel-Sherry",Isr J Health Policy Res,,583
352928,Social Connection is Essential in Long-Term Care Homes: Considerations During COVID-19 and Beyond,2021,"PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to determine the usability of lung ultrasonography (LUS) in the diagnosis of COVID-19, and to match the morphological features of lesions detected on computed tomography (CT) with the findings observed on LUS. METHODS: Sixty patients with COVID-19 were included in this prospective study. Patients were examined by radiology and anesthesia clinic specialists for a visual CT score. A LUS 12-zone ultrasonography protocol was applied by the investigator blinded to the CT and PCR test results. The characteristics of abnormal findings and the relationship of lesions to the pleura and the distance to the pleura were investigated. RESULTS: Forty-five males and 25 females evaluated within the scope of the study had an average age of 61.2 ± 15.3 years. The total CT score was calculated as 14.3 ± 5.3, and the LUS score was found to be 19.9 ± 7.6. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the measured LUS and CT scores (r = 0.857, p < 0.001). The mean distance of these lesions to the pleura was 5.2 ± 1.76 cm. LUS findings in 51 areas corresponded to non-pleural lesions on CT. There was a negative correlation between the measured distance to the pleura and the LUS scores (p < 0.001, r = - 0.708). CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the correlation between CT and LUS findings may be used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, although there are some limitations.

355234,How social determinants of health affect COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality,2021,"The early phase of embryonic development involves a lot of signaling and growth factor proteins that will influence the interactions among cells. Administration of BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin) at the beginning of embryo development can interferes organogenesis and causing abnormalities in embryo development. Administrations of BSA were expected to induce responses of the immune system, which be hoped mimicking the stress on immune system caused by infection such as of covid-19. This study aimed to screen the right BSA dose to influence the zebrafish immune system as model animal further study for covid-19 treatment. This research was conducted in the Laboratory of Animal Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Biology, Universitas Gadjah Mada. Eggs were immersed in 1%, 2.5% and 5% of BSA for imemersed in 1 hours and 5 hours repeated 3 times. The Parameter of the study were embryo survivalability rate, morphology, and physiological performance of contraction muscle per minutes and also heart rate per minutes. The data obtained were tested by ANOVA and DMRT test with a confidence level of 95%. The result showed BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin) 1% and 5% has significant effect on normal development and organ function of zebrafish embryos, such as muscle contraction and heart rate of the embryos, as conclusion 1% BSA dose is the most effective responses to induce immune system as model animal further study for covid-19 treatment.","Dita Arya, Widatama Retnoaji Bambang",IOP Conference Series.

356166,Correction to: Association of Death Anxiety with Spiritual Well­Being and Religious Coping in Older Adults During the COVID­19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection has become a pandemic disease (coronavirus disease 2019). The infection has moved from China to the rest of the world and Italy represents one of the most affected countries. Older adults are more susceptible to develop complications with the consequent highest mortality rates. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 95-year-old Caucasian woman affected by pneumonia, initially defined as common aspiration pneumonia in a bedridden patient with vascular dementia, which later turned out to be coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia during the initial spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in our district. Some features of a computed tomography scan of her chest and her clinical history with known dysphagia had led at first to a different diagnosis with a consequent exposure of health professionals to infectious risk in two distinct hospitals. In this case report, we describe the clinical/imaging features of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia and the diagnostic process that led to a correct diagnosis in a nonagenarian with multiple comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: This case report highlights both the possible pitfalls in diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in very old patients with comorbidities and the greater than expected spread of the infection, even in individuals with reduced interpersonal contacts and no defined epidemiological link.","Spannella, Francesco; Ristori, Letizia; Giulietti, Federico; Re, Serena; Schiavi, Paola; Giordano, Piero; Sarzani, Riccardo",J Med Case Rep,,583

In this study, 8 pregnant women with SARS-COV-2 who were admitted into Wuhan Children's Hospital, China from February 1, 2020 to March 30, 2020 and the clinical features, laboratory data, maternal and neonatal outcomes were analyzed. The mean age of the women at the time of admission was 30.6 years. The mean gestational age of the women was 37 weeks+4 days, and one woman presented with dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twin pregnancy. Except for one woman who was febrile, others had no typical clinical symptoms. For all pregnant women, the count of white blood cells and lymphocytes appeared normal, but 6 had a lower percentage of lymphocytes. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were normal for all the women. One neonate was tested positive for the coronavirus IgG and IgM antibodies. The clinical symptoms of the pregnant women with SARS-COV-2 were mild, and the laboratory data showed similar characteristics to those of non-infected pregnant women. Since one neonate was tested positive for coronavirus, there is a possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Prompt and efficient screening, triage, and isolation of pregnant women are effective management strategies to reduce nosocomial infection during the SARS-COV-2 epidemic.","Chen, Yu; Pang, Xiang-Li; Ding, Wen-Ping; Peng, Xiang-Chi; Yang, Jing; Zhou, Yan",Curr Med Sci,,583

356750,Emerging From the COVID-19 Crisis With a Stronger Health Care Workforce,2020,"PURPOSE: Although the use of steroids in the management of COVID-19 has been addressed by a few systematic review and meta-analysis, however, they also used data from ""SARS-CoV"" and ""MERS-CoV."" Again, most of these studies addressed only one severity category of patients or addressed only one efficacy endpoint (mortality). In this context, we conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of steroid therapy among all severity categories of patients with COVID-19 (mild to moderate and severe to critical category) in terms of ""mortality,"" ""requirement of mechanical ventilation,"" ""requirement of ICU"" and clinical cure parameters. METHODS: 11 databases were screened. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or high quality (on the basis of risk of bias analysis) comparative-observational studies were included in the analysis. RevMan5.3 was used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies (3 RCT and 12 comparative-observational studies) were included. In the mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 population, treatment with dexamethasone showed significant protection against mortality (single study). Among severe and critically ill combined population, steroid administration was significantly associated with lowered mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.83 [0.76-0.910]), lowered requirement of mechanical ventilation (RR 0.59 [0.51-0.69]), decreased requirement of intensive care unit (ICU) (RR 0.62 [0.45-0.86]), lowered length of ICU stay (single-study) and decreased duration of mechanical ventilation (two-studies). In mild to moderate population, steroid treatment was associated with a higher ""duration of hospital stay,"" while no difference was seen in other domains. In patients at risk of progression to ""acute respiratory distress syndrome,"" steroid administration was associated with ""reduced requirement of mechanical ventilation"" (single-study). CONCLUSION: This study guides the use of steroid across patients with different severity categories of COVID-19. Among mechanically ventilated patients, steroid therapy may be beneficial in terms of reduced mortality. Among ""severe and critical"" patients; steroid therapy was associated with lowered mortality, decreased requirement of mechanical ventilation, and ICU. However, no benefit was observed in ""mild to moderate"" population. To conclude, among properly selected patient populations (based-upon clinical severity and biomarker status), steroid administration may prove beneficial in patients with COVID-19.","Sarma, Phulen; Bhattacharyya, Anusuya; Kaur, Hardeep; Prajapat, Manisha; Prakash, Ajay; Kumar, Subodh; Bansal, Seema; Kirubakaran, Richard; Reddy, Dibbanti Harikrishna; Muktesh, Gaurav; Kaushal, Karanvir; Sharma, Saurabh; Shekhar, Nishant; Avti, Pramod; Thota, Prasad; Medhi, Bikash",Indian J Pharmacol,,583

METHODS: We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infections among U.S. Marine Corps recruits who underwent a 2-week quarantine at home followed by a second supervised 2-week quarantine at a closed college campus that involved mask wearing, social distancing, and daily temperature and symptom monitoring. Study volunteers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by means of quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) assay of nares swab specimens obtained between the time of arrival and the second day of supervised quarantine and on days 7 and 14. Recruits who did not volunteer for the study underwent qPCR testing only on day 14, at the end of the quarantine period. We performed phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes obtained from infected study volunteers to identify clusters and to assess the epidemiologic features of infections. RESULTS: A total of 1848 recruits volunteered to participate in the study; within 2 days after arrival on campus, 16 (0.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 15 of whom were asymptomatic. An additional 35 participants (1.9%) tested positive on day 7 or on day 14. Five of the 51 participants (9.8%) who tested positive at any time had symptoms in the week before a positive qPCR test. Of the recruits who declined to participate in the study, 26 (1.7%) of the 1554 recruits with available qPCR results tested positive on day 14. No SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified through clinical qPCR testing performed as a result of daily symptom monitoring. Analysis of 36 SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained from 32 participants revealed six transmission clusters among 18 participants. Epidemiologic analysis supported multiple local transmission events, including transmission between roommates and among recruits within the same platoon. CONCLUSIONS: Among Marine Corps recruits, approximately 2% who had previously had negative results for SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of supervised quarantine, and less than 2% of recruits with unknown previous status, tested positive by day 14. Most recruits who tested positive were asymptomatic, and no infections were detected through daily symptom monitoring. Transmission clusters occurred within platoons.

Organized by a multidisciplinary committee, Israel's research community was invited to offer insights to COVID-19 policy challenges. The Datathon was designed to (1) develop operationalizable data-driven models to address COVID-19 health-policy challenges and (2) build a community of researchers from academia, industry, and government and rebuild their trust in the government. Three specific challenges were defined based on their relevance (significance, data availability, and potential to anonymize the data): immunization policies, special needs of the young population, and populations whose rate of compliance with COVID-19 testing is low. The MoH team extracted diverse, reliable, up-to-date, and deidentified governmental datasets for each challenge. Secure remote-access research environments with relevant data science tools were set on Amazon Web. The MoH screened the applicants and accepted around 80 participants, teaming them to balance areas of expertise as well as represent all sectors of the community. One week following the event, anonymous surveys for participants and mentors were distributed to assess overall usefulness and points for improvement. The 48-hour Datathon and pre-event sessions included 18 multidisciplinary teams, mentored by 20 data scientists, 6 epidemiologists, 5 presentation mentors, and 12 judges. The insights developed by the 3 winning teams are currently considered by the MoH as potential data science methods relevant for national policies. The most positive results were increased trust in the MoH and greater readiness to work with the government on these or future projects. Detailed feedback offered concrete lessons for improving the structure and organization of future government-led datathons.","Peleg, Mor; Reichman, Amnon; Shachar, Sivan; Gadot, Tamir; Tsadok, Meytal Avgil; Azaria, Maya; Dunkelman, Orr; Hassid, Shiri; Partem, Daniella; Shmailov, Maya; Yom-Tov, Elad; Cohen, Roy",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13068v1.pdf,583

358282,"CNAs and Friends, Allies Rally for Health Care Heroes With Virtual March",2021,"This study investigated the possibility of inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the compounds alpha-Boswellic acid (ABA) and beta-Boswellic acid (BBA) which are active components in the well-known natural product Boswellia carterii (BC). The SARS-CoV-2 virus reproduces in the body by linking its spike with the cell receptor. At the same time, a pH range (4.5-6) of the cell's lysosomes is considered as a perfect environment to release RNA in the cell cytoplasm. In view of these, docking studies were employed to study the interaction between the spikes of the virus and ABA or BBA using Molecular Graphic Laboratory (MGL) tools and AutoDock Vina application. The binding of the ABA and BBA with the spike of the virus could inhibit its reproduction or provide sufficient time for the immune system to recognize the virus and hence, produce suitable antibodies. In addition, the pKa of ABA, BBA and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were calculated using HF/6-311G (d,p) method and then they were compared with the experimental pKa of HCQ. The Lethal Concentrations (LC50) of ABA and BBA were also calculated. In addition, molecular electrostatic potential is reported which indicates the active sites of ABA and BBA.","Kadhim, M.

358406,Physical health interventions for patients who have experienced a first episode of psychosis: a narrative review,2020,"BACKGROUND: Qingfei Paidu Tang (QPT), a formula of traditional Chinese medicine, which was suggested to be able to ease symptoms in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been recommended by clinical guidelines and widely used to treat COVID-19 in China. However, whether it decreases mortality remains unknown. PURPOSE: We aimed to explore the association between QPT use and in-hospital mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study based on a real-world database was conducted. METHODS: We identified patients consecutively hospitalized with COVID-19 in 15 hospitals from a national retrospective registry in China, from January through May 2020. Data on patients' characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were extracted from the electronic medical records. The association of QPT use with COVID-19 related mortality was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models based on propensity score analysis. RESULTS: Of the 8939 patients included, 28.7% received QPT. The COVID-19 related mortality was 1.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8% to 1.7%) among the patients receiving QPT and 4.8% (95% CI 4.3% to 5.3%) among those not receiving QPT. After adjustment for patient characteristics and concomitant treatments, QPT use was associated with a relative reduction of 50% in-hospital COVID-19 related mortality (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.66 p < 0.001). This association was consistent across subgroups by sex and age. Meanwhile, the incidences of acute liver injury (8.9% [95% CI, 7.8% to 10.1%] vs. 9.9% [95% CI, 9.2% to 10.7%]; odds ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.81% to 1.14%], pâ¯=â¯0.658) and acute kidney injury (1.6% [95% CI, 1.2% to 2.2%] vs. 3.0% [95% CI, 2.6% to 3.5%]; odds ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.17], pâ¯=â¯0.318) were comparable between patients receiving QPT and those not receiving QPT. The major study limitations included that the study was an observational study based on real-world data rather than a randomized control trial, and the quality of data could be affected by the accuracy and completeness of medical records. CONCLUSIONS: QPT was associated with a substantially lower risk of in-hospital mortality, without extra risk of acute liver injury or acute kidney injury among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Zhang, Lihua; Zheng, Xin; Bai, Xueke; Wang, Qing; Chen, Bowang; Wang, Haibo; Lu, Jiapeng; Hu, Shuang; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Haibo; Liu, Jiamin; Shi, Ying; Zhou, Zhiye; Gan, Lanxia; Li, Xi; Li, Jing",Phytomedicine,,583

359066,Assessing the Readability of Covid-19 Testing Messages on the Internet,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unprecedented worldwide health problem that requires concerted and global approaches to stop the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets lung epithelium cells, there is growing evidence that the intestinal epithelium is also infected. Here, using both colon-derived cell lines and primary non-transformed colon organoids, we engage in the first comprehensive analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle in human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs). Our results demonstrate that hIECs fully support SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication, and production of infectious de novo virus particles. We found that viral infection elicits an extremely robust intrinsic immune response where interferon-mediated responses are efficient at controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication and de novo virus production. Taken together, our data demonstrate that hIECs are a productive site of SARS-CoV-2 replication and suggest that the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2 may participate in the pathologies observed in COVID-19 patients by contributing to increasing patient viremia and fueling an exacerbated cytokine response.","Stanifer, Megan L; Kee, Carmon; Cortese, Mirko; Zumaran, Camila Metz; Triana, Sergio; Mukenhirn, Markus; Kraeusslich, Hans-Georg; Alexandrov, Theodore; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Boulant, Steeve",Cell Rep,,583

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cohort study included 115 adult patients admitted to the ICU with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Anthropometric variables and biochemical (C-reactive protein, ferritin, leukocyte, neutrophils, and fibrinogen) were measured. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations. RESULTS: Mean age was 50.6±11.2 years, 68.7% were male. Median BMI was 30.9kg/m2. All patients had invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients with diabetes had increased risk of mortality with OR of 2.86 (CI 95% 1.1-7.4, p=0.026); among those patients who, in addition to diabetes had obesity, the risk was de 3.17 (CI 95% 1.9-10.2, p=0.038). Patients with obesity had 1.25 times greater risk of developing a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (95% CI 1.09-1.46, p=0.025). Negative correlation was observed between BMI and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio (r=-0.023, p<0.05). Obese patients required more days of mechanical ventilation and longer hospital stay compared to non-obese patients. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes and obesity are risk factors for increasing severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and they are both associated with an increase in mortality.","Pérez-Cruz, Elizabeth; Castañón-González, Jorge Alberto; Ortiz-Gutiérrez, Salvador; Garduño-López, Jessica; Luna-Camacho, Yuritzy",Obesity research &amp; clinical practice (Online),,583

361544,National Health Service interventions in England to improve care to Armed Forces veterans,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is an international crisis placing tremendous strain on medical systems around the world. Like other specialties, neuroanesthesiology has been adversely affected and training programs have had to quickly adapt to the constantly changing environment. METHODS: An email-based survey was used to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on clinical workflow, clinical training, education, and trainee well-being. The impact of the International Council on Perioperative Neuroscience Training (ICPNT) accreditation was also assessed. RESULTS: Responses were received from 14 program directors (88% response rate) in 10 countries and from 36 fellows in these programs. Clinical training was adversely affected because of the cancellation of elective neurosurgery and other changes in case workflow, the introduction of modified airway and other protocols, and redeployment of trainees to other sites. To address educational demands, most programs utilized online platforms to organize clinical discussions, journal clubs, and provide safety training modules. Several initiatives were introduced to support trainee well-being during the pandemic. Feelings of isolation and despair among trainees varied from 2 to 8 (on a scale of 1 to 10). Fellows all reported concerns that their clinical training had been adversely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic because of decreased exposure to elective subspecialty cases and limited opportunities to complete workplace-based assessments and training portfolio requirements. Cancellation of examination preparation courses and delayed examinations were cited as common sources of stress. Programs accredited by the ICPNT reported that international networking and collaboration was beneficial to reduce feelings of isolation during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Neuroanesthesia fellowship training program directors introduced innovative ways to maintain clinical training, educational activity and trainee well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rajan, Shobana; Bebawy, John; Avitsian, Rafi; Lee, Chanhung Z; Rath, Girija; Luoma, Astri; Bilotta, Federico; Pierce, John T; Kofke, William A",J Neurosurg Anesthesiol,,583
361657,Eating Habits and Physical Activity of the Spanish Population during the COVID-19 Pandemic Period,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Our primary aim was to validate the Liverpool Peritonsillar abscess Score (LPS) externally in a new patient cohort. Our secondary aim was to modify the LPS in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic to produce a no-examination variant for use in this instance. DESIGN: Prospective multicentre external validation study. SETTING: Six different secondary care institutions across the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Patients over 16 years old who were referred to ENT with any uncomplicated sore throat such a tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess (PTA). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for both the original LPS model and the modified model for COVID-19. RESULTS: The LPS model had sensitivity and specificity calculated at 98% and 79%, respectively. The LPS has a high negative predictive value (NPV) of 99%. The positive predictive value (PPV) was slightly lower at 63%. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, including the area under the curve (AUROC), was 0.888 which indicates very good accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: External validation of the LPS against an independent geographically diverse population yields high NPV. This may support non-specialist colleagues who may have concerns about mis-diagnosing a PTA. The COVID-19 modification of the LPS has a similar NPV, which may be of use where routine oral examination is to be avoided during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Selwyn, David; Yang, Ding; Heward, Elliot; Kerai, Ashwin; Thompson, Elinor; Shommakhi, Abulgasem; Faulkner, Scott; Siau, Richard; Walijee, Hussein; Hampton, Tom; Chudek, Dorota; Singhera, Supriya; Din, Waqas; Lau, Andrew S",Clin. otolaryngol,,583

365974,"Nursing Homes, COVID-19, And More",2021,"The precautionary principle is part of evidence-based healthcare and is used both preventively and therapeutically when there is no available evidence about how to manage problems/diseases/conditions that are especially life-threatening. However, since it is not always based in the most qualified evidence, it is frequently questioned. The emergence of a highly contagious disease, with increased levels of morbimortality, an acute respiratory syndrome, the so called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), led health professionals to look for the best alternatives to save lives. In this sense, the precautionary principle was evocated. The aim of this paper is to make a reflection about the precautionary principle, the dental profession and COVID-19. It is important to have in mind that in such a disease, guidelines, protocols and approaches can change very fast, since a continuous evaluation of all policies is mandatory. During the pandemic, elective procedures may be restricted, but international organizations removed the recommendation to postpone elective procedures. Clinicians are advised to be updated about their local current policies. On the other hand, there are cases in which in-office dental care is unavoidable, such as individuals with pain, spontaneous bleeding and dental trauma. Biosafety is upmost importance when seeking patients during pandemic. In this sense, it was concluded that precautionary principle should be, therefore, used. However, caution needs to be taken and continuous surveillance necessary.","Rösing, Cassiano Kuchenbecker; Cavagni, Juliano; Langa, Gerson Pedro José; Mazzetti, Thais; Muniz, Francisco Wilker Mustafa Gomes",Pesqui.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out between 1 May and 30 June 2020. The study included 359 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and assessed by clinical evaluation, nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction, and lung computed tomography. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-seven (54.9%) of the patients were male and 162 (45.1%) were female. The mean age of the patients was 58.5 years (20-91). Two hundred ninety-four (81.9%) patients were treated in the inpatient clinic and 65 (18.1%) patients were treated in the intensive care unit. Various ocular diseases were observed in 16 (4.5%) of the patients. Although the rate of ocular disease was 12 out of 294 (4.1%) in patients followed up in the inpatient clinic, this rate was 4 out of 65 (6.2%) in intensive care patients. There was no systemic problem in one patient, in whom conjunctival hyperemia was the first and only reason for admission to the hospital. Four patients followed up in the inpatient clinic had conjunctivitis at the time of admission, and conjunctivitis occurred in three patients during hospitalization.

Using information obtained from Italian surgeons in Milan and given the concerns regarding the increasing case numbers in Washington State, we implemented new vascular surgery guidelines, which canceled all nonemergent surgical procedures and involved significant changes to our inpatient and outpatient workflow. The consequences of these decisions are not yet understood. METHODS: The vascular surgery division at Harborview Medical Center immediately instituted new vascular surgery COVID-19 practice guidelines on March 17, 2020. Subsequent clinic, operative, and consultation volume data were collected for the next 4 weeks and compared with the historical averages. The Washington State case and death numbers and University of Washington Medical Center (UW Medicine) hospital case volumes were collected from publicly available sources. RESULTS: Since March 10, 2020, the number of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases within the UW Medicine system has increased 1867%, with floor and intensive care unit bed usage increasing by 120% and 215%, respectively. After instituting our new COVID-19 guidelines, our average weekly clinical volume decreased by 96.5% (from 43.1 patients to 1.5 patients per week), our average weekly surgical volume decreased by 71.7% (from 15 cases to 4.25 cases per week), and our inpatient consultation volume decreased to 1.81 consultations daily; 60% of the consultations were completed as telemedicine ""e-consults"" in which the patient was never evaluated in-person. The trainee surgical volume has also decreased by 86.4% for the vascular surgery fellow and 84.8% for the integrated resident. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed every aspect of ""normal"" vascular surgical practice in a large academic institution. New practice guidelines effectively reduced operating room usage and decreased staff and trainee exposure to potential infection, with the changes to clinic volume not resulting in an immediate increase in emergency department or inpatient consultations or acute surgical emergencies. These changes, although preserving resources, have also reduced trainee exposure and operative volume significantly, which requires new modes of education delivery. The lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, if analyzed, will help us prepare for the next crisis.","Hemingway, Jake F; Singh, Niten; Starnes, Benjamin W",J Vasc Surg,,583

An online survey was conducted with 11,333 people (52.4% females; mean age = 46.3 ± 14.6 years, range = 18-89 years) during the mild lockdown in the seven prefectures most affected by COVID-19 infection. Over one-third (36.6%) of participants experienced mild-to-moderate psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale [K6] score 5-12), while 11.5% reported serious psychological distress (K6 score &#8805; 13). The estimated prevalence of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score &#8805; 10) was 17.9%. Regarding the distribution of K6 scores, the proportion of those with psychological distress in this study was significantly higher when compared with the previous national survey data from 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019. Healthcare workers, those with a history of treatment for mental illness, and younger participants (aged 18-19 or 20-39 years) showed particularly high levels of psychological distress. Psychological distress severity was influenced by specific interactional structures of risk factors: high loneliness, poor interpersonal relationships, COVID-19-related sleeplessness and anxiety, deterioration of household economy, and work and academic difficulties. Even when non-coercive lockdowns are implemented, people's mental health should be considered, and policies to prevent mental health deterioration are needed. Cross-disciplinary public-private sector efforts tailored to each individual's problem structure are important to address the mental health issues arising from lockdown.","Yamamoto, Tetsuya; Uchiumi, Chigusa; Suzuki, Naho; Yoshimoto, Junichiro; Murillo-Rodriguez, Eric",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,583

371839,Older Adults with COVID-19 Can Choose Care at Home: Lessons Learned from New York City,2020,"BACKGROUND: Platelets have been demonstrated to be potent activators of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation during sepsis. However, the mediators and molecular pathways involved in human platelet-mediated NET generation remain poorly defined. Circulating plasma exosomes mostly originating from platelets may induce vascular apoptosis and myocardial dysfunction during sepsis; however, their role in NET formation remains unclear. This study aimed to detect whether platelet-derived exosomes could promote NET formation during septic shock and determine the potential mechanisms involved. METHODS: Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were cocultured with exosomes isolated from the plasma of healthy controls and septic shock patients or the supernatant of human platelets stimulated ex vivo with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A lethal cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model was used to mimic sepsis in vivo; then, NET formation and molecular pathways were detected. RESULTS: NET components (dsDNA and MPO-DNA complexes) were significantly increased in response to treatment with septic shock patient-derived exosomes and correlated positively with disease severity and outcome. In the animal CLP model, platelet depletion reduced plasma exosome concentration, NET formation, and lung injury. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that exosomal high-mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1) and/or miR-15b-5p and miR-378a-3p induced NET formation through the Akt/mTOR autophagy pathway. Furthermore, the results suggested that I&#954;B kinase (IKK) controls platelet-derived exosome secretion in septic shock. CONCLUSIONS: Platelet-derived exosomes promote excessive NET formation in sepsis and subsequent organ injury. This finding suggests a previously unidentified role of platelet-derived exosomes in sepsis and may lead to new therapeutic approaches.","Jiao, Yang; Li, Weiwei; Wang, Wei; Tong, Xingyu; Xia, Ran; Fan, Jie; Du, Jianer; Zhang, Chengmi; Shi, Xueyin",Crit Care,,583

The infection causes Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in people of all age groups, notably diabetic and old age people, at a higher risk of infectivity and fatality. Around 35% of the patients who have died of the disease were diabetic. The infection is associated with weakening immune response, chronic inflammation, and potential direct pancreatic impairment. There seems to be a three-way association of the SARS-CoV-2 infection with diabetes and aging. The COVID-19 infection causes metabolism complications, which may induce diabetes and accelerate aging in healthy individuals. How does diabetes elevate the likelihood of the infection is not clearly understood. we summarize mechanisms of accelerated aging in COVID-19 and diabetes, and the possible correlation of these three diseases. Various drug candidates under different stages of pre-clinical or clinical developments give us hope for the development of COVID-19 therapeutics, but there is no approved drug so far to treat this disease. Here, we explored the potential of anti-diabetic and anti-aging natural compounds for the COVID-19 treatment. We have also reviewed different therapeutic strategies with plant-based natural products that may be used to cure patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and post-infection syndrome.","Chawla, Udeep; Kashyap, Manoj Kumar; Husain, Amjad",Mol. cell. biochem,,583

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 158 patients with biologically confirmed COVID-19 who underwent a chest CT after the onset of the symptoms were included. There were 84 men and 74 women with a mean age of 68±14 (SD) years (range: 24-96years). There were 100 non-severe and 58 severe cases. Their clinical data were recorded and the first chest CT examination was reviewed using a computerized standardized report. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed in order to identify the risk factors associated with disease severity. Two models were built: one was based only on qualitative CT features and the other one included a semi-quantitative total CT score to replace the variable representing the extent of the disease. Areas under the ROC curves (AUC) of the two models were compared with DeLong's method. RESULTS: Central involvement of lung parenchyma (P<0.001), area of consolidation (P<0.008), air bronchogram sign (P<0.001), bronchiectasis (P<0.001), traction bronchiectasis (P<0.011), pleural effusion (P<0.026), large involvement of either one of the upper lobes or of the middle lobe (P<0.001) and total CT score&#8805;15 (P<0.001) were more often observed in the severe group than in the non-severe group. No significant differences were found between the qualitative model (large involvement of either upper lobes or middle lobe [odd ratio (OR)=2.473], central involvement [OR=2.760], pleural effusion [OR=2.699]) and the semi-quantitative model (total CT score&#8805;15 [OR=3.342], central involvement [OR=2.344], pleural effusion [OR=2.754]) with AUC of 0.722 (95% CI: 0.638-0.806) vs. 0.739 (95% CI: 0.656-0.823), respectively (P=0.209).

OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the incidence and predictive factors of cardiovascular complications and new-onset arrhythmias in Black and White hospitalized COVID-19 patients and determine the impact of new-onset arrhythmia on outcomes. METHODS: We collected and analyzed baseline demographic and clinical data from COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans, Louisiana, between March 1 and May 1, 2020. RESULTS: Among 310 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the mean age was 61.4 ± 16.5 years, with 58,7% females, and 67% Black patients. Black patients were more likely to be younger, have diabetes and obesity. The incidence of cardiac complications was 20%, with 9% of patients having new-onset arrhythmia. There was no significant difference in cardiovascular outcomes between Black and White patients. A multivariate analysis determined age &#8805;60 years to be a predictor of new-onset arrhythmia (OR = 7.36, 95% CI [1.95;27.76], p = .003). D-dimer levels positively correlated with cardiac and new-onset arrhythmic event.

Emerging research suggest an unanticipated impact of COVID-19 on mental and/or psychological health of both the general community and affected individuals. The fear of the COVID-19 epidemic and the consequent lockdown and economic crisis has led to globally increased psychological distress. The biological bases of immediate and new onset of psychiatric symptoms in individuals with COVID-19 are not yet known. COVID-19 infection may lead to activated immune-inflammatory pathways and a cytokine storm. Activated immune-inflammatory pathways, especially chronic low-grade inflammation, are associated with major psychiatric disorders in at least a subset of individuals. We propose that both the (sub)chronic inflammatory response and cytokine storm might crucially be involved in the immediate manifestation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with COVID-19 infection as well as heightened expression of psychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 infected individuals with prior psychiatric conditions. These events might expand concepts in psychoneuroimmunology, with the importance of chronic-low grade inflammation augmented by the cytokine storm hypothesis. Additionally, this might augment and refine diagnosis and prognostic management as well as treatment.","Debnath, Monojit; Berk, Michael; Maes, Michael","Brain, Behav., Immun. - Health",,583

This study explored various factors influencing the COVID-19 vaccination intention and the applicability of the health belief model (HBM) to explore vaccination intention among the population of Saudi Arabia. Methods: This is an online survey conducted between January 6, 2021, and January 19, 2021, using a GoogleTM form questionnaire among Saudi population. The questionnaire aimed to assess the factors that influence the intent to receive the vaccine, by evaluating demographic details, COVID-19 experience and health self-assessment, acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination and preferences and health belief regarding COVID-19 illness and vaccination. Results: The survey generated a total of 1333 responses from all over the 13 provinces of the Kingdom. The participants had mixed perceptions regarding the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. A total of 959 (71.9%) subjects responded positively to COVID-19 vaccine intent. Those with &gt;15,000 SR per month income, no past exposure to COVID-19, and comorbidities reported significantly higher intention to take vaccination (p&lt;0.05). Among the HBM variables, the perceived susceptibility construct (OR=3.82, 95% CI 1.64-8.94) and perceived benefit construct (OR=7.59, CI 1.65-34.86) were important facilitators for a definite intention to vaccinate. The perceived barriers construct (safety [OR= 0.062, CI 0.03-0.15];side effects of the vaccine [OR=0.31, CI 0.13-0.75]) and cues to action construct (OR=0.32, CI 0.13-0.77) were the significant factors hindering the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine. However, the perceived severity construct did not play an important role in predicting definite intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the Saudi population.

Methods: In this prospective study, 206 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from regional medical institutions between December 20, 2019, and April 10, 2020. We collated a range of data to derive and validate a predictive model for COVID-19 progression, including demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and cytokine levels. Variation analysis, along with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Boruta algorithms, was used for modeling. The performance of the derived models was evaluated by specificity, sensitivity, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), Akaike information criterion (AIC), calibration plots, decision curve analysis (DCA), and Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Results: We used the LASSO algorithm and logistic regression to develop a model that can accurately predict the risk of progression to severe COVID-19. The model incorporated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), interleukin (IL)-6, expectoration, fatigue, lymphocyte ratio (LYMR), aspartate transaminase (AST), and creatinine (CREA). The model yielded a satisfactory predictive performance with an AUC of 0.9104 and 0.8792 in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. The final model was then used to create a nomogram that was packaged into an open-source and predictive calculator for clinical use. The model is freely available online at https://severeconid-19predction. shinyapps.io/SHINY/. Conclusion: In this study, we developed an open-source and free predictive calculator for COVID-19 progression based on ALT, IL-6, expectoration, fatigue, LYMR, AST, and CREA.

383007,Caring for the Psychological Well-Being of Healthcare Professionals in the Covid-19 Pandemic Crisis,2020,"There is a great debate regarding the usefulness and efficacy of this medication in anti-viral treatment: chloroquine is not included in the panel recommended for HIV treatment, while its modest effect in the therapy of human virus infection is reported for chronic hepatitis C These findings did not allow for its inclusion in the standardised therapeutic protocols for hepatitis C patients The benefits of chloroquine therapy strongly depend on: (i) the age of the patient;(ii) the clinical presentation and (iii) the stage of the COVID-19 disease Noteworthy, the use of this drug is contraindicated in some conditions, particularly the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency The latter is a condition that has not been deeply taken into account particularly when, on the web, there has been a ""viral"" spread of news emphasizing the safe use and the free availability of chloroquine Therefore, before establishing that the use of chloroquine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 could represent a good option in light of such announcements, we should not miss the following important information that limit the friendly access to the drug: (a) G6PD is a housekeeping enzyme that, in the red blood cell (RBC), guarantees the production of NADPH, which is required to preserve glutathione in the reduced state (GSH), (b) G6PD deficiency shows marked genetic heterogeneity In this regard, we have reported more than 186 mutations, (c) G6PD deficiency is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the occurrence of clinical manifestations: the incidence of clinically evident favism in a group of randomly selected enzymopenic individuals resulted to be less than 30%, (d) the estimated number of G6PD-deficient individuals is close to 400 million people worldwide, while the number of pathogenic gene variants is generally concentrated in a small group of variations that can be easily detected in reference laboratories, and (e) as the rate of deficient RBCs in heterozygote carriers is not predictable a priori, potential individual clinical complications can strongly be proportional to the fraction of the number of G6PD-imbalanced RBCs Moreover, the majority of G6PD-deficient subjects do not show clinical manifestations in the steady state and the condition remains undetected until they are exposed to an exogenous haemolytic trigger such as bacterial or viral infections, ingestion of fava beans (favism) or drugs, mainly the hydroxychloroquine","Capoluongo, E.

384743,Usefulness of a Telemedicine Tool TELEA in the Management of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Currently there are no licensed vaccines and limited antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19. Heparin (delivered systemically) is currently used to treat anticoagulant anomalies in COVID-19 patients. In addition, in the UK, Brazil and Australia, nebulised unfractionated heparin (UFH) is being trialled in COVID-19 patients as a potential treatment. A systematic comparison of the potential antiviral effect of various heparin preparations on live wild-type SARS-CoV-2, in vitro, is needed. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Seven different heparin preparations including UFH and low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) of porcine or bovine origin were screened for antiviral activity against live SARS-CoV-2 (Australia/VIC01/2020) using a plaque inhibition assay with Vero E6 cells. Interaction of heparin with spike protein RBD was studied using differential scanning fluorimetry, and the inhibition of RBD binding to human ACE2 protein using ELISA assays was examined. KEY RESULTS: All the UFH preparations had potent antiviral effects, with IC50 values ranging between 25-41 µg ml-1 whereas LMWHs were less inhibitory by ~150-fold (IC50 range 3.4 - 7.8 mg ml-1 ). Mechanistically we observed that heparin binds and destabilizes the RBD protein, and furthermore we show heparin directly inhibits the binding of RBD to the human ACE2 protein receptor. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This comparison of clinically relevant heparins shows UFH has significantly stronger SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity compared to LMWHs. UFH acts to directly inhibit binding of spike protein to the human ACE2 protein receptor. Overall the data strongly support further clinical investigation of UFH as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19.","Tree, Julia A; Turnbull, Jeremy E; Buttigieg, Karen R; Elmore, Michael J; Coombes, Naomi; Hogwood, John; Mycroft-West, Courtney J; Lima, Marcelo A; Skidmore, Mark A; Karlsson, Richard; Chen, Yen-Hsi; Zhang, Yang; Spalluto, Cosma Mirella; Staples, Karl J; Yates, Edwin A; Gray, Elaine; Singh, Dave; Wilkinson, Tom; Page, Clive P; Carroll, Miles W",Br. j. pharmacol,,583

However, little is known about the adoption of ICTs by psychologists and the impact of such technologies on their practice. This study aimed to explore psychologists' practices related with the use of ICTs before and during the COVID-19 lockdown, to identify the main changes that the pandemic has brought and the impact that such changes have had on their practice with clients, and also identify the factors that potentially have affected such changes. The Portuguese Psychologists Association announced the study, and 108 psychologists responded to an online survey during the mandatory lockdown. The results showed that these professionals continued to provide their services due to having adopted ICTs. Comparing with face-to-face interventions, psychologists recognized that additional precautions/knowledge were needed to use such technologies. Despite the challenges identified, they described the experience with the use of ICTs as positive, meeting clients' adherence, and yielding positive results. Psychologists with the most years of professional experience maintained their services the most, but those with average experience showed the most favorable attitudes toward the use of technologies and web-based interventions.","Dores, Artemisa R; Geraldo, Andreia; Carvalho, Irene P; Barbosa, Fernando",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,583

390241,Key messages and actions for coronavirus peneumonia prevention and control in education institutions/ 中国学校卫生,2020,"BACKGROUND: Gender imbalances in academia have been evident historically and persist today. For the past 60 years, we have witnessed the increase of participation of women in biomedical disciplines, showing that the gender gap is shrinking. However, preliminary evidence suggests that women, including female researchers, are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of unequal distribution of childcare, elderly care, and other kinds of domestic and emotional labor. Sudden lockdowns and abrupt shifts in daily routines have had disproportionate consequences on their productivity, which is reflected by a sudden drop in research output in biomedical research, consequently affecting the number of female authors of scientific publications. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate adverse effect on the productivity of female researchers in the biomedical field in terms of authorship of scientific publications. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational bibliometric study. We investigated the proportion of male and female researchers who published scientific papers during the COVID-19 pandemic, using bibliometric data from biomedical preprint servers and selected Springer-Nature journals. We used the ordinary least squares regression model to estimate the expected proportions over time by correcting for temporal trends. We also used a set of statistical methods, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and regression discontinuity design, to test the validity of the results. RESULTS: A total of 78,950 papers from the bioRxiv and medRxiv repositories and from 62 selected Springer-Nature journals by 346,354 unique authors were analyzed. The acquired data set consisted of papers that were published between January 1, 2019, and August 2, 2020. The proportion of female first authors publishing in the biomedical field during the pandemic dropped by 9.1%, on average, across disciplines (expected arithmetic mean yest=0.39; observed arithmetic mean y=0.35; standard error of the estimate, Sest=0.007; standard error of the observation, &#963;x=0.004). The impact was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19 research, where the proportion of female scientists in the first author position dropped by 28% (yest=0.39; y=0.28; Sest=0.007; &#963;x=0.007). When looking at the last authors, the proportion of women dropped by 7.9%, on average (yest=0.25; y=0.23; Sest=0.005; &#963;x=0.003), while the proportion of women writing about COVID-19 as the last author decreased by 18.8% (yest=0.25; y=0.21; Sest=0.005; &#963;x=0.007). Further, by geocoding authors' affiliations, we showed that the gender disparities became even more apparent when disaggregated by country, up to 35% in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings document a decrease in the number of publications by female authors in the biomedical field during the global pandemic. This effect was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19, indicating that women are producing fewer publications related to COVID-19 research. This sudden increase in the gender gap was persistent across the 10 countries with the highest number of researchers. These results should be used to inform the scientific community of this worrying trend in COVID-19 research and the disproportionate effect that the pandemic has had on female academics.","Muric, Goran; Lerman, Kristina; Ferrara, Emilio",J Med Internet Res,,583
390380,"The confrontation in the scenario of vaccines, health, and COVID-19",2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a rapid increase of space in highly infectious disease intensive care units (ICUs). At Houston Methodist Hospital (HMH), a virtual intensive care unit (vICU) was used amid the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to detail the novel adaptations and rapid expansion of the vICU that were applied to achieve patient-centric solutions while protecting staff and patients' families during the pandemic. METHODS: The planned vICU implementation was redirected to meet the emerging needs of conversion of COVID-19 ICUs, including alterations to staged rollout timing, virtual and in-person staffing, and scope of application. With the majority of the hospital critical care physician workforce redirected to rapidly expanded COVID-19 ICUs, the non-COVID-19 ICUs were managed by cardiovascular surgeons, cardiologists, neurosurgeons, and acute care surgeons. HMH expanded the vICU program to fill the newly depleted critical care expertise in the non-COVID-19 units to provide urgent, emergent, and code blue support to all ICUs. RESULTS: Virtual family visitation via the Consultant Bridge application, palliative care delivery, and specialist consultation for patients with COVID-19 exemplify the successful adaptation of the vICU implementation. Patients with COVID-19, who were isolated and separated from their families to prevent the spread of infection, were able to virtually see and hear their loved ones, which bolstered the mental and emotional status of those patients. Many families expressed gratitude for the ability to see and speak with their loved ones. The vICU also protected medical staff and specialists assigned to COVID-19 units, reducing exposure and conserving personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Telecritical care has been established as an advantageous mechanism for the delivery of critical care expertise during the expedited rollout of the vICU at Houston Methodist Hospital. Overall responses from patients, families, and physicians are in favor of continued vICU care; however, further research is required to examine the impact of innovative applications of telecritical care in the treatment of critically ill patients.","Dhala, Atiya; Sasangohar, Farzan; Kash, Bita; Ahmadi, Nima; Masud, Faisal",J Med Internet Res,,583

392341,Shared voices of Filipino occupational therapists during the COVID-19 pandemic: reflections from an online forum,2020,"Current management of valvular heart disease (VHD) seeks to optimize long-term outcome by timely intervention. Recommendations for treatment of patients with symptoms due to severe valvular disease are based on a foundation of solid evidence. However, when to intervene in asymptomatic patients remains controversial and decision requires careful individual weighing of the potential benefits against the risk of intervention and its long-term consequences. The primary rationale for earlier intervention is prevention of irreversible left ventricular (LV) myocardial changes that might result in later clinical symptoms and adverse cardiac events. A number of outcome predictors have been identified that facilitate decision-making. This review summarizes current recommendations and discusses recently published data that challenge them suggesting even earlier intervention. In adults with asymptomatic aortic stenosis (AS), emerging risk markers include very severe valve obstruction, elevated serum natriuretic peptide levels, and imaging evidence of myocardial fibrosis or increased extracellular myocardial volume. Currently, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is not recommended for treatment of asymptomatic severe AS although this may change in the future. In patients with aortic regurgitation (AR), the potential benefit of early intervention in preventing LV dilation and dysfunction must be balanced against the long-term risk of a prosthetic valve, a particular concern because severe AR often occurs in younger patients with a congenital bicuspid valve. In patients with mitral stenosis, the option of transcatheter mitral balloon valvotomy tilts the balance towards earlier intervention to prevent atrial fibrillation, embolic events, and pulmonary hypertension. When chronic severe mitral regurgitation is due to mitral valve prolapse, anatomic features consistent with a high likelihood of a successful and durable valve repair favour early intervention. The optimal timing of intervention in adults with VHD is a constantly changing threshold that depends not only on the severity of valve disease but also on the safety, efficacy, and long-term durability of our treatment options.","Baumgartner, Helmut; Iung, Bernard; Otto, Catherine M",Eur. heart j,,583

The aim of this study was to compare the impact of COVID-19 lockdown orders and after lockdown orders were lifted on substance use, mental health, and weight-related behaviors among a sample of post-BS adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective medical chart review identified BS patients from one university-based obesity medicine clinic and two BS practices. An online non-anonymous survey was implemented in two phases: during lockdown (April 1-May 31, 2020) and after lockdown orders were lifted (June 1, 2020-September 30, 2020) to obtain information about the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on BS patients. RESULTS: A total of 189 (during lockdown=39, post-lockdown=150) participants (90.4% female, mean age 52.4 years, SD 11.1, 49.8% non-Hispanic White, 30.6% non-Hispanic Black, 16.1% Hispanic) participated. Lockdown participants were more likely to have sleep problems (74.3% vs. 56.1%, P=.039) and feel anxious (82.0% vs. 63.0%, P=.024) versus post-lockdown participants. A majority (83.4%) reported depression in both lockdown/post-lockdown. Post-lockdown participants were more than 20 times more likely to report substance use compared those in lockdown (aOR 20.56, 95% CI 2.66-158.4). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a substantial negative impact on substance use, mental health, and weight-related health behaviors in diverse BS patients.

This report comprises the cases of 3 patients with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy who were evaluated with thromboelastography (TEG) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) to enable personalized anticoagulant therapy. CASE REPORT Three patients presented with COVID-19 pneumonia, confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, who developed thrombohemorrhagic coagulopathy.Case 1: A 72-year-old woman on long-term warfarin therapy for a history of venous thromboembolism developed a right upper lobe pulmonary embolus, despite an international normalized ratio of 6.4 and aPTT of 120.7 s. TEG enabled successful anticoagulation with heparin, and her pulmonary infarct was no longer present 2 weeks later.Case 2: A 55-year-old woman developed a rectus sheath hematoma while on heparin, and TEG demonstrated increased fibrinolysis despite COVID-19 patients more commonly undergoing fibrinolytic shutdown.Case 3: A 43-year-old woman had significant thrombus burden while severely hypocoagulable according to laboratory testing. As the venous thrombi enlarged in a disseminated intravascular coagulopathic-like state, the heparin dose was escalated to achieve a target aPTT of 70 to 80 s, resulting in a flat line TEG tracing. CONCLUSIONS These 3 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia with complex and varied clinical histories demonstrated the clinical value of TEG combined with the measurement of aPTT to facilitate personalized anticoagulation, resulting in good clinical outcomes.","Bunch, Connor M; Thomas, Anthony V; Stillson, John E; Gillespie, Laura; Lin, Kevin P; Speybroeck, Jacob; Kwaan, Hau C; Fulkerson, Daniel H; Zamlut, Mahmud; Khan, Rashid; Walsh, Mark M",Am J Case Rep,,583

We aimed to describe the clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory findings of patients in Saudi Arabia infected with SARS-CoV-2 to direct us in helping prevent and treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across Saudi Arabia and around the world. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of pediatric and adult patients in five hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were surveyed in this study. RESULTS: 401 patients (mean age 38.16 ± 13.43 years) were identified to be SARS-CoV-2 positive and 80% of cases were male. 160 patients had moderate severity and 241 were mild in severity. The most common signs and symptoms at presentation were cough, fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, aspartate aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, and ferritin were higher in the COVID-19 moderate severity patient group.

399669,"Mental health, the hidden crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 is posing major public health challenges. One feature of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the insertion of multi-basic residues at the S1/S2 subunit cleavage site. Here, we find that the virus with intact spike (Sfull) preferentially enters cells via fusion at the plasma membrane, whereas a clone (Sdel) with deletion disrupting the multi-basic S1/S2 site utilizes an endosomal entry pathway. Using Sdel as model, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR screen and identify several endosomal entry-specific regulators. Experimental validation of hits from the CRISPR screen shows that host factors regulating the surface expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) affect entry of Sfull virus. Animal-to-animal transmission with the Sdel virus is reduced compared to Sfull in the hamster model. These findings highlight the critical role of the S1/S2 boundary of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in modulating virus entry and transmission and provide insights into entry of coronaviruses.","Zhu, Yunkai; Feng, Fei; Hu, Gaowei; Wang, Yuyan; Yu, Yin; Zhu, Yuanfei; Xu, Wei; Cai, Xia; Sun, Zhiping; Han, Wendong; Ye, Rong; Qu, Di; Ding, Qiang; Huang, Xinxin; Chen, Hongjun; Xie, Youhua; Cai, Qiliang; Yuan, Zhenghong; Zhang, Rong",Nat Commun,,583

Much of this development has been based on the reference genome collected on January 5, 2020. Based on the genotyping of 15â¯140 genome samples collected up to June 1, 2020, we report that SARS-CoV-2 has undergone 8309 single mutations which can be clustered into six subtypes. We introduce mutation ratio and mutation h-index to characterize the protein conservativeness and unveil that SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein, main protease, and endoribonuclease protein are relatively conservative, while SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, spike protein, and papain-like protease are relatively nonconservative. In particular, we have identified mutations on 40% of nucleotides in the nucleocapsid gene in the population level, signaling potential impacts on the ongoing development of COVID-19 diagnosis, vaccines, and antibody and small-molecular drugs.","Wang, Rui; Hozumi, Yuta; Yin, Changchuan; Wei, Guo-Wei",J. chem. inf. model,,583

400567,I may never see the ocean again: Loss and grief among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Political and public health leaders promoting COVID-19 vaccination should identify the most relevant criteria driving the vaccination decision. Social media is increasingly used as a source of vaccination data and as a powerful communication tool to increase vaccination. In December 2020, we performed a cross-sectional social media-based survey addressing personal sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccination in the USA. Our primary research objective is to identify socio-demographic characteristics and the reasons for the 1644 survey participants' attitudes regarding vaccination. We present clear evidence that, contrary to the prevailing public perceptions, young audiences using social media have mostly a positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination (81.5%). These younger individuals want to protect their families and their relatives (96.7%); they see vaccination as an act of civic responsibility (91.9%) and express strong confidence in their healthcare providers (87.7%). Another critical factor is the younger population's fear of personal COVID-19 infection (88.2%); moreover, the greater the number of children the participants have, the greater is their intent to get the COVID-19 vaccine. These results enable a practical public-messaging pathway to reinforce vaccination campaigns addressing the younger population.","Benis, Arriel; Seidmann, Abraham; Ashkenazi, Shai",,,583

As hospital systems run well over capacity, facing possible shortages of critical care medical resources and personal protective equipment as well as clinician deaths, the psychological stressors necessitate a strong well-being support model for staff. At the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York City, health care workers have been heroically providing frontline care to COVID-19 patients while facing their own appropriate fears for their personal safety in the setting of contagion. This moral obligation cannot be burdened by unacceptable risks; the health system's full support is required to address the needs of its workforce.In this Invited Commentary, the authors describe how an MSHS Employee, Faculty, and Trainee Crisis Support Task Force-created in early March 2020 and composed of behavioral health, human resources, and well-being leaders from across the health system-used a rapid needs assessment model to capture the concerns of the workforce related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The task force identified 3 priority areas central to promoting and maintaining the well-being of the entire MSHS workforce during the pandemic: meeting basic daily needs; enhancing communications for delivery of current, reliable, and reassuring messages; and developing robust psychosocial and mental health support options. Using a work group strategy, the task force operationalized the rollout of support initiatives for each priority area. Attending to the emotional well-being of health care workers has emerged as a central element in the MSHS COVID-19 response, which continues to be committed to the physical and emotional needs of a workforce that courageously faces this crisis.","Ripp, Jonathan; Peccoralo, Lauren; Charney, Dennis",Acad Med,,583

A first step to establish whether pre-existing responses can impact SARS-CoV-2 infection is to understand the nature and extent of cross-reactivity in humans to coronaviruses. Here we compare serum antibody and memory B cell responses to coronavirus spike proteins from pre-pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors using binding and functional assays. We show weak evidence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive serum antibodies in pre-pandemic donors. However, we find evidence of pre-existing cross-reactive memory B cells that are activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Monoclonal antibodies show varying degrees of cross-reactivity with betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and endemic coronaviruses.

Methods: A total of 118 patients with advanced NSCLC who progressed after standard regimens were included in this retrospective study. Efficacy was evaluated and toxicity profile was recorded. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curve and multivariate analysis was adjusted using Cox regression analysis. Results: All of the 118 patients with NSCLC were available for evaluation of efficacy. Complete response (CR, 0 case), partial response (PR, 10 cases), stable disease (SD, 79 cases) and progressive disease (PD, 29 cases) were evaluated according to RECIST version 1.1. In consequence, objective response rate (ORR) was 8.47% and disease control rate (DCR) was 75.42%. The median PFS of the 118 patients with NSCLC was 4.3 months and the median OS was 10.3 months. The results of Cox regression analysis suggested that ECOG score was an independent factor for PFS. The toxicity profile indicated that hypertension and hand-foot syndrome were the most common adverse reactions. Additionally, the preliminary analysis of an efficacy predictor suggested that the PFS of patients with hypertension was superior to those without hypertension. Conclusion: Anlotinib is effective and safe for patients with advanced NSCLC who progressed after standard regimens in real world situations. Hypertension may be a biomarker for efficacy prediction.","Cheng, Jian-De; Chai, Li-Xun; Zhao, Zhi-Ping; Hao, Yan-Yan; Li, Shuo",Cancer Manag Res,,583

A review of research articles produced in the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic shows that COVID-19 research had smaller teams and involved fewer nations than pre-COVID-19 coronavirus research. The United States and China were, and continue to be in the pandemic era, at the center of the global network in coronavirus related research, while developing countries are relatively absent from early research activities in the COVID-19 period. Not only are China and the United States at the center of the global network of coronavirus research, but they strengthen their bilateral research relationship during COVID-19, producing more than 4.9% of all global articles together, in contrast to 3.6% before the pandemic. In addition, in the COVID-19 period, joined by the United Kingdom, China and the United States continued their roles as the largest contributors to, and home to the main funders of, coronavirus related research. These findings suggest that the global COVID-19 pandemic shifted the geographic loci of coronavirus research, as well as the structure of scientific teams, narrowing team membership and favoring elite structures. These findings raise further questions over the decisions that scientists face in the formation of teams to maximize a speed, skill trade-off. Policy implications are discussed.","Fry, Caroline V; Cai, Xiaojing; Zhang, Yi; Wagner, Caroline S",PLoS One,,583

RESULTS: Four patients underwent endonasal (4) and endo-oral surgery (1). Fluorescein was applied to the surgical field. Black light examination of fluorescein-treated operative fields revealed minimal contamination distant to the surgical field. In two prolonged cases with high-speed drilling, droplets were identified under the barrier and on the tip of the smoke evacuator.

405200,Psychometric properties of the COVID stress scales (CSS) within Arabic language in a Palestinian context,2021,"Neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to correlate with protection in animals and humans, disease severity, survival, and vaccine efficacy. With the ongoing large-scale vaccination in different countries and continuous surge of new variants of global concerns, a convenient, cost-effective and high-throughput neutralization test is urgently needed. Conventional SARS-CoV-2 neutralization test is tedious, time-consuming and requires a biosafety level 3 laboratory. Despite recent reports of neutralizations using different pseudoviruses with a luciferase or green fluorescent protein reporter, the laborious steps, inter-assay variability or high background limit their high-throughput potential. In this study we generated lentivirus-based pseudoviruses containing a monomeric infrared fluorescent protein reporter to develop neutralization assays. Similar tropism, infection kinetics and mechanism of entry through receptor-mediated endocytosis were found in the three pseudoviruses generated. Compared with pseudovirus D614, pseudovirus with D614G mutation had decreased shedding and higher density of S1 protein present on particles. The 50% neutralization titers to pseudoviruses D614 or D614G correlated with the plaque reduction neutralization titers to live SARS-CoV-2. The turn-around time of 48-72 h, minimal autofluorescence, one-step image quantification, expandable to 384-well, sequential readouts and dual quantifications by flow cytometry support its high-throughput and versatile applications at a non-reference and biosafety level 2 laboratory, in particular for assessing the neutralization sensitivity of new variants by sera from natural infection or different vaccinations during our fight against the pandemic.","Tsai, Wen-Yang; Ching, Lauren L; Hsieh, Szu-Chia; Melish, Marian E; Nerurkar, Vivek R; Wang, Wei-Kung",Emerg Microbes Infect,,583

METHODS: We draw eight lessons from the first 8 months of the pandemic, describing how COVID-19 has intensified pre-existing gaps in the MCH support network and created new problems. For each lesson identified, we present supporting evidence and a call for specific actions that can be taken by MCH practitioners, researchers and advocates. RESULTS: LESSON #1: COVID-19 hits communities of color hardest, exposing and exacerbating health inequities caused by systemic racism. LESSON #2: Women experience the most devastating social, economic and mental health tolls during COVID-19. LESSON #3: Virulent pathogens find and exacerbate cracks in our public health and health care systems. LESSON #4: COVID-19 has become a pretext to limit access to sexual and reproductive health care. LESSON #5: COVID-19 has exposed and deepened fault lines in maternity care: over-medicalization, discrimination, lack of workforce diversity, underutilization of collaborative team approaches, and lack of post-delivery follow-up. LESSON #6: The pandemic adds impetus to much-needed Medicaid policy reforms that can have a lasting positive effect on maternal health. LESSON #7: Social and health policy changes, heretofore deemed infeasible, ARE possible under pandemic threat. LESSON #8: Finally, an overarching COVID-19 lesson: We are all inextricably connected.

METHODS: The participants were 217 PLWH with confirmed diagnoses of HIV and undergoing antiretroviral treatment. They assessed their NA and rumination for five consecutive days each evening via an online survey. RESULTS: Results showed that inertia in NA is negatively related to inertia in rumination. Both innovations were unrelated. However, the individuals with relatively higher overall NA were also more reactive to external factors and/or had more variability in their daily lives, to which they respond with NA. Finally, the autoregressive effects were revealed to be important for spillover effects in a direction that is coherent with a given inertia. Thus, the direction of the cascade between daily NA and rumination depends on the area of major regulatory weakness. CONCLUSION: The results support the view that intensity, inertia, and innovation are distinct dimensions in spite of the common assumption that higher overall intensity of emotions and coping should be strongly related or even synonymous to their perseveration.","Rzeszutek, Marcin; Gruszczynska, Ewa",Anxiety Stress Coping,,583

409026,Vietnam's Containment of COVID-19: Why the Coronavirus Mortality has Been So Low,2021,"During the first Covid-19 wave, our paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), like many others across the globe, was transformed into an adult ICU for patients with severe Covid-19, due to a shortage of adult ICU beds. Here, we provide a comprehensive description of all the conditions that must be fulfilled to successfully accomplish this transformation. Strong support from all hospital departments was crucial, as their activity was modified by the change. Healthcare workers from various units, notably the paediatric anaesthesiology department, worked in the adult ICU to ensure sufficient staffing. The number of physiotherapists and psychologists was increased. A support system for both healthcare workers and patients' relatives was set up with the help of the mobile paediatric palliative care and support team. Supplies suitable for adults were ordered. Protocols for numerous procedures were written within a few days. Video tutorials, checklists, and simulation sessions were circulated to the entire staff. The head nurses guided and supported the new staff and usual PICU staff. The transformation was achieved within a week. The main difficulties were healthcare worker stress, changes in recommendations over time, absence of visits from relatives, and specific adult issues that paediatricians are unfamiliar with.Conclusion: For the staff, caring for adult patients was made easier by working in their familiar unit instead of being moved to an adult hospital with unfamiliar staff members and equipment. Strong support from the hospital and the assistance of consultants from adult hospital departments were crucial. What is Known: â¢ The dramatic spread across the world of coronavirus disease 2019 generated critical care needs that drastically exceeded resources in many countries worldwide. â¢ Paediatric ICU activity during this period decreased due to lockdown measures and the fact that children rarely required ICU for coronavirus disease 2019.

World War II witnessed a particularly shameful chapter in humanitarian history as the ICRC faced an impossible choice: publicly denouncing the Holocaust or collaborating with the Third Reich to secure access to prisoner-ofwar (POW) camps.1 Respecting neutrality and state sovereignty was the price to provide relief;it was a price that the ICRC paid, choosing to protect allied POWs over concentration camp victims. Aid agencies scramble for funds in a donor marketplace, which propels a competitive mindset of organizational preservation and branding that can overshadow outcomes. [...]resources shape who is saved and how. The global humanitarian architecture for the pandemic consists of the UN’s main bodies—the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Food Programme (WFP), and the International Organization for Migration (IOM).","Hoffman, Peter J.; Weiss, Thomas G.",Georgetown Journal of International Affairs,,583

Materials and Methods: The text processing pipeline first extracts COVID-19 symptoms and related concepts such as severity, duration, negations, and body parts from patients posts using conditional random fields. An unsupervised rule-based algorithm is then applied to establish relations between concepts in the next step of the pipeline. The extracted concepts and relations are subsequently used to construct two different vector representations of each post. These vectors are applied separately to build support vector machine learning models to triage patients into three categories and diagnose them for COVID-19. Results: We report that macro- and micro-averaged F1 scores in the range of 71-96% and 61-87%, respectively, for the triage and diagnosis of COVID-19, when the models are trained on human labelled data. Our experimental results indicate that similar performance can be achieved when the models are trained using predicted labels from concept extraction and rule-based classifiers, thus yielding end-to-end machine learning. Also, we highlight important features uncovered by our diagnostic machine learning models and compare them with the most frequent symptoms revealed in another COVID-19 dataset. In particular, we found that the most important features are not always the most frequent ones.","Hasan, Abul; Levene, Mark; Weston, David; Fromson, Renate; Koslover, Nicolas; Levene, Tamara",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.11850v3.pdf,583

412022,"Lessons from COVID 19: for now, and in the future",2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by a novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. Measurement of viral load requires the use of reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), which in turn requires advanced equipment and techniques. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the viral load measurement using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), which is a simpler procedure compared to RT-qPCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA was extracted by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. The RT-LAMP assay was performed by using the Loopamp® 2019-SARS-CoV-2 detection reagent kit and 10-fold serial dilutions of known viral load RT-LAMP were used to measure Tt, which is the time until the turbidity exceeds the threshold. Based on the relationship between viral load and Tt, the linearity and detection sensitivity of the calibration curve were evaluated. In addition, 117 clinical specimens were measured, and RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP assay results were compared. RESULTS: The dilution linearity of the calibration curve was maintained at five orders of magnitude 1.0× 106 to 1.0 × 101 copies/µL, and was confirmed to be detectable down to 1.0 × 100 copies/µL. The limit of quantification of RNA extracted from clinical specimens using RT-LAMP correlated well with that obtained using RT-qPCR (r2 = 0.930). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that RT-LAMP is an effective method to determine the viral load of SARS-CoV-2.","Minami, Kenta; Masutani, Ryota; Suzuki, Youichi; Kubota, Meri; Osaka, Naofumi; Nakanishi, Toyofumi; Nakano, Takashi; Ukimura, Akira",J. infect. chemother,,583

We performed a systemic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence and the duration of shedding of fecal RNA in patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Chinese databases Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang Data up to June 2020 were searched for studies evaluating fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including anal and rectal samples, in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The pooled prevalence of fecal RNA in patients with detectable respiratory RNA was estimated. The days of shedding and days to loss of fecal and respiratory RNA from presentation were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies (N = 1,636) met criteria. The pooled prevalence of fecal RNA in COVID-19 patients was 43% (95% confidence interval [CI] 34%-52%). Higher proportion of patients with GI symptoms (52.4% vs 25.9%, odds ratio = 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.7) compared with no GI symptoms, specifically diarrhea (51.6% vs 24.0%, odds ratio = 3.0, 95% CI 1.9-4.8), had detectable fecal RNA. After loss of respiratory RNA, 27% (95% CI 15%-44%) of the patients had persistent shedding of fecal RNA. Days of RNA shedding in the feces were longer than respiratory samples (21.8 vs 14.7 days, mean difference = 7.1 days, 95% CI 1.2-13.0). Furthermore, days to loss of fecal RNA lagged respiratory RNA by a mean of 4.8 days (95% CI 2.2-7.5). DISCUSSION: Fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA is commonly detected in COVID-19 patients with a 3-fold increased risk with diarrhea. Shedding of fecal RNA lasted more than 3 weeks after presentation and a week after last detectable respiratory RNA.","Zhang, Yawen; Cen, Mengsha; Hu, Mengjia; Du, Lijun; Hu, Weiling; Kim, John J; Dai, Ning",Clin Transl Gastroenterol,,583

Parity has yet to be investigated as an indicator of social vulnerability in young women. We adapted an SVI score, previously used by the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC), and calculated SVI for young urban South African women (n = 1584; median age 21.6, IQR 3.6 years). Social vulnerability was more frequently observed in women with children and increased as parity increased. Furthermore, young women classified as socially vulnerable were 2.84 times (95% CI 2.10-3.70; p < 0.001) more likely to report household food insecurity. We collected this information in 2018-2019, prior to the current global COVID-19 pandemic. With South Africa having declared a National State of Disaster in March 2020, early indicators suggest that this group of women have indeed been disproportionally affected, supporting the utility of such measures to inform disaster relief efforts.","Ware, Lisa J; Kim, Andrew W; Prioreschi, Alessandra; Nyati, Lukhanyo H; Taljaard, Wihan; Draper, Catherine E; Lye, Stephen J; Norris, Shane A",J. public health policy,,583

ObjectiveTo estimate the association between vaccination and COVID-19 hospitalization rate in MHD patients DesignUsing Bayesian multivariable spatiotemporal models, we estimated the expected number of SARS-CoV-2 severe infections (infections with hospital admission) in MHD patients from simultaneous cases in the general population. SettingFrench population-based retrospective analysis in MHD and non-dialysis patients. ParticipantsModels were fitted from 3620 hospitalizations of MHD patients and 457,160 hospitalizations in the general population. ExposureSevere SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general population and vaccine exposure. Main Outcome and MeasureWeekly incidence of severe infections in MHD patients. ResultsDuring the first epidemic wave, incidence of severe infections in MHD patients was approximately proportional to incidence in the general population. However, our model overestimated incidence during the second wave, suggesting an effect of prevention measures during the 2nd wave. A second model (based on data up to the end of the 2nd wave) estimated that the risk in MHD patients decreased between waves 1 and 2, with incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.70 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.76). Moreover, while this model correctly estimated the reported MHD cases up to the end of the 2nd wave, predictions overestimated the expected number of cases from the beginning of the vaccination campaign. Using vaccination coverages as additional predictors permitted to correctly fit the weekly reported number of cases, with IRR in MHD patients of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.58) for vaccine exposure in MHD patients and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.61) per 10% increase in vaccination coverage in the same-age general population. Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings suggest that both individual and herd immunity due to vaccination may yield a protective effect against severe forms of COVID-19 in MHD patients. QuestionWhether vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 limits hospitalization rates in hemodialysis patients is still unknown. FindingsBy modeling the dynamics of 3620 hospital admissions for SARS-CoV-2 infections among hemodialysis patients, as a proportion of 457,160 cases reported in the French general population from March 2020 to April 2021, we identified vaccination coverage in both hemodialysis patients and the general population as independently associated with protection of hemodialysis patients against severe infection. MeaningVaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is associated with reduced hospitalization rate in hemodialysis patients.","karoui, khalil el; hourmant, maryvonne; ayav, carole; glowacki, francois; couchoud, cecile; lapidus, nathanael; registry, - REIN",,,583

By comparing the responses of 867 churchgoers aged seventy or over with the responses of 924 churchgoers under the age of sixty, the data found that those aged seventy or over had less sympathy for the national leadership of the Church, had experienced the lock-up of churches more negatively, had less good experience of the online alternatives provided by the Church, and were more pessimistic about the longer-term sustainability of their churches. Those aged seventy or over may have been shielding during the lockdown, but may not have been shielded from the impact of the experience on their attitude toward the Church.

Monuments are being taken down, flags are being redesigned, and institutions that honored those who denied the humanity of Black people are being renamed. Unfortunately for Sandra Bland, Breonna Taylor, Sha-Asia Washington and countless other Black transgender people including those with capacity for pregnancy, there was no justice even prior to the global pandemic of SARS-Cov-2 or coronavirus; namely racism, violence, and the Black Maternal Health crisis that makes it less likely that Black women will survive pregnancy and childbirth. The purpose of this article is to situate the state of Black people with the capacity for pregnancy in the context of these existing crises to illuminate the myths that racism has perpetuated through science, health services provision and policy. The greatest of these is the myth of a default human that can serve as a standard for the rest of the population. This racist ideal underpins education, provision of care, research, policies, and public health praxis. Demolishing the myth starts with acknowledging that Black people are not the architects of their own destruction: the default standard of whiteness is. The article begins with a historical background on how this myth came to be and elucidates the development and perpetuations of the myth of the default human. Next, we present an evidence based scoping review of the literature to summarize current thinking with specific focus on the Black maternal health crisis, we make policy recommendations and retrofits of upstream public health approaches for existing programs toward health equity. We also situate Black maternal health as part of a reproductive justice frame that centers Black women and birthing people's autonomy and agency. In other words, we use the scoping review to end with reimagining public health policy and provide an actionable roadmap to specifically disrupt the myth of the default human and dismantle racism in education, provision of care, research, policies, and public health praxis.","Bray, Stephanie R M; McLemore, Monica R",Front Public Health,,583

The presentation of the disease ranges from asymptomatic manifestations through to acute respiratory distress syndrome with the necessity of mechanical ventilation. Cytokine storm and maladaptive responses to the viral spread in the body could be responsible for the severity of disease. Many patients develop acute kidney injury (AKI) during the course of their disease, especially in more severe cases. Many factors could cause kidney damage during infection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. It is still unclear whether direct viral damage or the overexpression of cytokines and inflammatory factors are preeminent. According to autoptic studies, in most of the cases, AKI is due proximal tubular damage. However, cases of collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis were reported as well in the absence of signs of direct viral infection of the kidney. Considering that severe hypoxia is a hallmark of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the involvement of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) system is very likely, possibly influencing the inflammatory response and outcome in both the lungs and kidneys. Several bodies of evidence have shown a possible role of the HIF pathway during AKI in various kidney disease models. Similar observations were made in the setting of acute lung injury. In both organs, HIF activation by means of inhibition of the prolyl-hydroxylases domain (PHD) could be protective. Considering these promising experimental data, we hypothesize that PHD inhibitors could be considered as a possible new therapy against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Del Vecchio, Lucia; Locatelli, Francesco",Clin Kidney J,,583

The photocatalytic processes could effectively decrease the load of viruses in indoor air. However, a constant viral model may not be generalizable to other airborne viruses. In photocatalytic processes, temperature and humidity play a distinct role in the inactivation of viruses through changing photocatalytic rate. The main mechanisms for inactivation of airborne viruses in the photocatalytic processes included chemical oxidation by the reactive oxygen species (ROS), the toxicity of metal ions released from metal-containing photocatalysts, and morphological damage of viruses.","Poormohammadi, Ali; Bashirian, Saeid; Rahmani, Ali Reza; Azarian, Ghasem; Mehri, Freshteh",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,583
422452,Single-valued neutrosophic N-soft set and intertemporal single-valued neutrosophic N-soft set to assess and pre-assess the mental health of students amidst COVID-19,2020,"The UNWTO’s discourse has focused on managing the effects of COVID-19 on tourism mobility since the outbreak was taken over by the WHO, as tourism is prominent amongst the hardest hit sectors. Emanating from the UNWTO as one of the dominant stakeholders in tourism discourse construction, an interesting component is the new meaning attributed to ‘responsible tourism’, which coincides with severe sanitary measures in this moment. Through critical discourse analysis and the theoretical framework offered by Iris Marion Young on responsibility for justice, this article will first demonstrate how the reappropriation of the term is in line with the UNWTO’s neoliberal perspective on tourism. The result is the promotion of sanitary measures for the protection of tourism as a consumer industry, rather than for the protection of the individuals involved. It is also cementing the pedestal on which the UN agency places the tourist-consumer, namely through the International Code for the Protection of Tourists project. This paper closes with thoughts on how the emerging dominant discourse on responsible tourism is internalized by tourism stakeholders as the new normal, which would gain in being explored through the lens of Foucault’s work on the concept of biopolitics and the neoliberal subject.","Tremblay-Huet, Sabrina Lapointe Dominic",Tourism and Hospitality,,583

425008,Views on COVID-19 and Use of Face Coverings Among U.S. Youth,2021,"COVID-19, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019 and has resulted in the current pandemic. The disease continues to pose a major therapeutic challenge. Patient mortality is ultimately caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Cytokine release syndrome (or cytokine storm ) is likely to be a contributing factor to ARDS in many patients. Because interleukin 6 (IL-6) is known to play a key role in inflammation, IL-6 receptor inhibitors such as tocilizumab may potentially treat COVID-19 by attenuating cytokine release. We present the case of a 48-year-old male with severe COVID-19, on the verge of meeting intubation requirements, who needed progressive oxygen support for respiratory distress. The patient was treated with a non-weight-based dosage of tocilizumab to prevent the onset of a cytokine storm. We chose to administer an IL-6 inhibitor because of the gradually increasing levels of acute phase reactants identified on serial blood draws, as well as his declining respiratory status. The treatment was well-tolerated in conjunction with standard drug therapies for COVID-19 (hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and zinc). The patient subsequently experiencedmarked improvements in his respiratory symptoms and overall clinical status over the following days. We believe that tocilizumab played a substantial role in his ability to avert clinical decline, particularly the need for mechanical ventilation. Ultimately, the patient was downgraded from the ICU and discharged within days. We highlight the potential of IL-6 inhibitors to prevent the progression of respiratory disease to a point requiring ventilator support. This case underscores the potential importance of early serial measurements of IL-6 and cytokine storm-associated acute phase reactants, such as ferritin, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein, in guiding clinical decision-making in the management of patients with suspected COVID-19. Conclusion: The early, proactive identification of serumacute phase reactants should be implemented in the treatment of COVID-19 in order to screen for a primary contributor tomortality the cytokine storm. This screening, when followed by aggressive early treatment for cytokine storm, may have optimal therapeutic benefits and obviate the need for mechanical ventilation, thereby decreasing mortality. Additionally, we reviewcurrent evidence regarding cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 and the use of IL-6 receptor inhibition as a therapeutic strategy, and examine other reported cases in the literature describing IL-6 antagonist treatment for patients with COVID-19.","Farooqi, Faryal; Dhawan, Naveen; Morgan, Richard; Dinh, John; Nedd, Kester; Yatzkan, George",Trop.

Higher mortality among men, disproportionate social, economic, and health effects on ethnic and racial minorities, high infection rates among the predominantly female health workforce, the rise in violence against women and people of diverse sexual orientation and gender identities, the heavy burden of unpaid care on women, and diminished access to essential services such as sexual and reproductive health services are some of the factors that bring to the fore the urgency of capturing disparities and delivering a gender transformative and equitable response to the pandemic.

The analytic engine includes automated techniques, whereas common visual outputs include flow maps and spatiotemporal hot spots. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to address a gap in the literature, with the specific objective to synthesize literature on the use of VA tools, techniques, and frameworks in interrelated health care areas of population health and health services research (HSR). METHODS: Using the 2018 PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, the review focuses on peer-reviewed journal articles and full conference papers from 2005 to March 2019. Two researchers were involved at each step, and another researcher arbitrated disagreements. A comprehensive abstraction platform captured data from diverse bodies of the literature, primarily from the computer and health sciences. RESULTS: After screening 11,310 articles, findings from 55 articles were synthesized under the major headings of visual and analytic engines, visual presentation characteristics, tools used and their capabilities, application to health care areas, data types and sources, VA frameworks, frameworks used for VA applications, availability and innovation, and co-design initiatives. We found extensive application of VA methods used in areas of epidemiology, surveillance and modeling, health services access, use, and cost analyses. All articles included a distinct analytic and visualization engine, with varying levels of detail provided. Most tools were prototypes, with 5 in use at the time of publication. Seven articles presented methodological frameworks. Toward consistent reporting, we present a checklist, with an expanded definition for VA applications in health care, to assist researchers in sharing research for greater replicability. We summarized the results in a Tableau dashboard. CONCLUSIONS: With the increasing availability and generation of big health care data, VA is a fast-growing method applied to complex health care data. What makes VA innovative is its capability to process multiple, varied data sources to demonstrate trends and patterns for exploratory analysis, leading to knowledge generation and decision support. This is the first review to bridge a critical gap in the literature on VA methods applied to the areas of population health and HSR, which further indicates possible avenues for the adoption of these methods in the future. This review is especially important in the wake of COVID-19 surveillance and response initiatives, where many VA products have taken center stage.

Also, previous studies have reported that neighborhood contexts have an influence on health outcomes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the association between neighborhood contexts and cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (per 100,000) in U.S. counties. Cumulative number of COVID-19 cases gained from USA FACTS and variables related to neighborhood contexts gained from the 2018 5-Year American Community Survey at the county level. Data were analyzed using spatial autoregressive models. According to the present results, firstly, larger population, high poverty rate, higher % of bachelor's degree, higher % of no health insurance, higher employment rate, higher % of manufacturing jobs, higher % of primary industry jobs, higher % of commute by drove alone, higher % of foreign born, higher % of Hispanic, and higher % of Black are positively associated with higher cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. Secondly, higher income, higher % of cash assistance recipient, higher % of SNAP recipient, higher unemployment rate, higher % of commute by walked, higher % of Asian, and higher % of senior citizen are negatively associated with higher cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. In conclusion, there exist geographical differences in cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in U.S. counties, which is influenced by various neighborhood contexts.

432893,The Tragic Plight of Frontline COVID-19 Warriors in Nepal,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Pandemic outbreaks necessitate effective responses to rapidly mitigate and control the spread of disease and eliminate the causative organism(s). While conventional chemical and biological solutions to these challenges are characteristically slow to develop and reach public availability; recent advances in device components operating at Super High Frequency (SHF) bands (3-30 GHz) of the electromagnetic spectrum enable novel approaches to such problems. METHODS: Based on experimentally documented evidence, a clinically relevant in situ radiation procedure to reduce viral loads in patients is devised and presented. Adapted to the currently available medical device technology to cause viral membrane fracture, this procedure selectively inactivates virus particles by forced oscillations arising from Structure Resonant Energy Transfer (SRET) thereby reducing infectivity and disease progression. RESULTS: Effective resonant frequencies for pleiomorphic Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is calculated to be in the 10-17 GHz range. Using the relation y = -3.308x + 42.9 with x and y representing log10 number of virus particles and the clinical throat swab Ct value respectively; in situ patient-specific exposure duration of ~15x minutes can be utilized to inactivate up to 100% of virus particles in the throat-lung lining, using an irradiation dose of 14.5 ± 1 W/m2; which is within the 200 W/m2 safety standard stipulated by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). CONCLUSIONS: The treatment is designed to make patients less contagious enhancing faster recoveries and enabling timely control of a spreading pandemic.

434156,Physical activity in periods of social distancing due to COVID-19: a cross-sectional survey,2020,"BACKGROUND: Maintaining the therapeutic care of psychiatric patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland required changes to the way in which sessions were conducted, such as telepsychiatric interventions or using face masks during on-site sessions. While little is known about how face masks affect the therapeutic experience of patients and therapists, the effectiveness of telepsychiatry is well documented for several psychiatric disorders. However, research on the benefits of telepsychiatry in adult patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remains scarce. This seems problematic since the symptoms typically associated with ADHD, such as attention problems and distractibility, may lessen the utility of telepsychiatry for this particular group. The present study's aim was to explore how adult patients with ADHD and their therapists experienced therapy sessions during the COVID-19 pandemic in three different settings: face-to-face with the therapist wearing a face mask, via telephone, or via videoconferencing. METHODS: In this exploratory, quantitatively driven mixed-method study (quantitative questionnaire data and qualitative data from open-ended responses), we assessed patients' evaluation of the session, their treatment satisfaction, and patients' and therapists' ratings of therapeutic alliance. We also collected qualitative comments on both sides' experience of the session. Overall, 97 therapist and 66 patient questionnaires were completed. Results are reported for the N = 60 cases for which data from both parties were available. Sequential multiple regressions adjusted for therapist and number of sessions were used for the main quantitative analyses. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences regarding session flow, post-session positivity, satisfaction and therapeutic alliance were observed. The only exception was that telepsychiatric sessions were rated as significantly less deep than face-to-face sessions, an effect that may decline over time, especially in the videoconferencing group. Patients and therapists identified similar facilitating and complicating aspects, but differed in their emphasis of specific elements. CONCLUSIONS: Both settings, on-site with the therapist wearing a face mask and telepsychiatric, seem to be valid options to continue treatment of adults with ADHD during a situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Aspects such as patient preference, session content, and therapeutic methods may be useful to identify the most suitable modality.","Wyler, Helen; Liebrenz, Michael; Ajdacic-Gross, Vladeta; Seifritz, Erich; Young, Susan; Burger, Pascal; Buadze, Anna",BMC Psychiatry,,583

434703,"Commentary: Social Determinants of Health and Latinx Families, Risk for COVID-19 Infection",2020,"The detection and management of diseases become quite complicated when pathogens contain asymptomatic phenotypes amongst their ranks, as evident during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Spreading of diseases has been studied extensively under the paradigm of Susceptible - Infected - Recovered - Deceased (SIRD) dynamics. Various game-theoretic approaches have also addressed disease spread, many of which consider S, I, R, and D as strategies rather than as states. Remarkably, most studies from the above approaches do not account for the distinction between the symptomatic or asymptomatic aspect of the disease. It is well-known that precautionary measures like washing hands, wearing masks and social distancing significantly mitigate the spread of many contagious diseases. Herein, we consider the adoption of such precautions as strategies and treat S, I, R, and D as states. We also attempt to capture the differences in epidemic spreading arising from symptomatic and asymptomatic diseases on various network topologies. Through extensive computer simulations, we examine that the cost of maintaining precautionary measures as well as the extent of mass testing in a population affects the final fraction of socially responsible individuals. We observe that the lack of mass testing could potentially lead to a pandemic in case of asymptomatic diseases. Network topology also seems to play an important role. We further observe that the final fraction of proactive individuals depends on the initial fraction of both infected as well as proactive individuals. Additionally, edge density can significantly influence the overall outcome. Our findings are in broad agreement with the lessons learnt from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Sinha, Saptarshi; Nath, Deep; Roy, Soumen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10387v2.pdf,583

The public healthcare system in Greece was already facing serious challenges at the outset of the outbreak following years of austerity and an escalating refugee crisis. This multi-center, cross-sectional study aims to assess the levels and associated risk factors of anxiety, depression, traumatic stress and burnout of frontline staff in Greece. A total of 464 self-selected HCWs in six reference hospitals completed a questionnaire comprising sociodemographic and work-related information and validated psychometric scales. The proportion of HCWs with symptoms of moderate/severe depression, anxiety and traumatic stress were 30%, 25% and 33%, respectively. Burnout levels were particularly high with 65% of respondents scoring moderate/severe in emotional exhaustion, 92% severe in depersonalization and 51% low/moderate in personal accomplishment. Predictive factors of adverse psychological outcomes included fear, perceived stress, risk of infection, lack of protective equipment and low social support. The psychological burden associated with COVID-19 in healthcare professionals in Greece is considerable, with more than half experiencing at least mild mental health difficulties. Findings signal the need for immediate organizational and individually tailored interventions to enhance resilience and support wellbeing under pandemic conditions.","Pappa, Sofia; Athanasiou, Nikolaos; Sakkas, Nikolaos; Patrinos, Stavros; Sakka, Elpitha; Barmparessou, Zafeiria; Tsikrika, Stamatoula; Adraktas, Andreas; Pataka, Athanasia; Migdalis, Ilias; Gida, Sofia; Katsaounou, Paraskevi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,583

We analysed odontogenic cervicofacial infections (CFI) presenting to oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) departments during the first wave of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom. From 1 April 2020 until 31 July 2020 a database was used to prospectively collect records for all patients with CFI who presented to oral and maxillofacial teams. Information gathered included clinical presentation, location/origin of infection, and how this was managed. The OMFS units were asked to compare the patient's care with the treatment that would usually have been given prior to the crisis. A total of 32 OMFS units recorded 1381 cases of CFI in the UK. Most of the infections were referred via the emergency department (74%). Lower first or second molars were the most common origin, contributing 40% of CFI. Collaborators reported that patients' treatments were modified as a response to COVID in 20% of cases, the most frequently cited reason being the application of COVID-19 hospital policy (85%). The impact of the first wave of COVID modified the management of a significant number of patients presenting with CFI, and there was a proactive move to avoid general anaesthetics where possible. Some patients who presented to secondary care were given no treatment, suggesting they could have been managed in primary dental care if this had been available. We recommend that OMFS units and urgent dental care centres (UDCCs) build strong communication links not only to provide the best possible patient care, but to minimise COVID exposure and the strain on emergency departments during the pandemic.","Puglia, F A; Ubhi, H; Dawoud, B; Magennis, P; Chiu, G A",Br. j. oral maxillofac. surg,,583

Over the last decade, new devices and fitness technology companies are attempting to tap into this data, uncovering a treasure trove of useful information that, when applied correctly, has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach healthcare and chronic conditions like asthma, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: By harnessing exciting developments in personalization, digitization, wellness, and patient engagement, care providers can improve health outcomes for our patients in a way we have never been able to do in the past. While new technologies to capture individual health metrics are everywhere, how can we use this information to make a real difference in our patients' lives? Navigating the complicated landscape of personal wearable devices, asthma inhaler sensors, and exercise apps can be daunting to even the most tech savvy physician. This manuscript will give you the tools necessary to make lasting changes in your patients' lives by exposing them to a world of usable, affordable, and relatable health technology that resonates with their personal fitness and wellness goals. These tools will be even more important post-COVID-19, as the landscape of clinical outpatient care changes from mainly in-person visits to a greater reliance on telemedicine and remote monitoring.","Greiwe, Justin; Nyenhuis, Sharmilee M",Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,,583

When personality profiles influence mental health and creativity during the COVID-19 lockdown,2021,"Introduction: 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks have been occurring in China and other countries in the world. To prevent further spread of the disease, restrictions of population flow from the government and measures to reduce virus transmission from hospitals may lead to the delay of diagnosis and treatment in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods: All NPC patients with radiotherapy indications were included from 20 weekdays before (group A) and after (group B) January 31, 2020, when the institute began to take measures against COVID-19. The waiting intervals of each step and variation from the diagnosis and treatment path of NPC between two groups were compared. Results: Significant differences were found between the group A and group B in the median waiting days for pathological biopsy (5 vs 15, P=0.012), radiotherapy immobilization and simulation (3.5 vs 16.5, P&lt;0.001), validation of position and plan (20 vs 61, P&lt;0.001) and initiation of radiotherapy (28 vs 36, P=0.005). During the waiting period of radiotherapy, 32.4% of the NPC patients received an additional one cycle of chemotherapy to the original treatment strategy. Conclusion: The prevalence of COVID-19 caused delay in the diagnosis and treatment of NPC patients to a certain extent. Additional chemotherapy could be considered to counteract the effect of treatment delay. More specific measures should be taken to balance the risk of delayed diagnosis and treatment of NPC and infection of COVID-19.","Yang, Youqi; Shen, Chunying; Hu, Chaosu",Cancer Manage. Res.,,583

445699,"Comments on ""Benefits of Sexual Activity on Psychological, Relational, and Sexual Health During the COVID-19 Breakout""",2021,"SARS-COV-2, or COVID-19, is a respiratory virus infecting over 86 million people worldwide. In addition to respiratory infections, SARS-COV-2 has been shown to include cardiovascular (CV) complications, including myocarditis and acute coronary syndrome. Risk of severe complications from SARS-COV-2 in individuals with existing CV and metabolic disease has been shown to be increased. Evidence indicates SARS-COV-2 enters tissues via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and that the virus is primed and activated by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The goal of this study was to determine ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels in pre-clinical swine models of heart failure (HF). We hypothesized sex, pressure-overload, and comorbidities would increase ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels. A retrospective analysis was conducted in previously completed studies in our lab including: 1) Female, intact Ossabaw swine that were either lean control or western diet-fed aortic-banded (N=4-5/group);2) Female Yucatan mini-swine subject to ovariectomy and/or aortic banding (N=5-8/group);and 3) Sedentary and exercise trained male, intact Yucatan mini-swine that were aortic banded. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels were evaluated in the left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV), and coronary vasculature using qRT-PCR. Linear regression analysis was used to determine differences between the following variables: pig species, sex hormones, aortic banding, comorbidities, exercise training, and tissue. Data was log-transformed to meet linear regression assumptions. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels were significantly influenced by sex, comorbidity, and tissue type. TMPRSS2 mRNA levels were also influenced by species and disease status. Specifically, ACE2 mRNA levels decreased 57.1% in the LV and increased 169.9% in the RV of males compared to coronary vessels in intact females. TMPRSS2 mRNA levels increased in the LV and RV of males (1,218.6% and 5,479.8%, respectively) compared to coronary vessels in intact females. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels increased 344% and 453.4%, respectively, in the LV of Ossabaw swine fed a Western Diet compared to coronary vessels from Yucatan and Ossabaw swine without comorbidities. Species differences indicated TMPRSS2 mRNA levels increased 449.2% in the RV and 498.6% in the LV in Yucatan mini-swine compared to coronary vessels in Ossabaw swine. A 107.3% increase in TMPRSS2 mRNA level was observed in male swine without HF compared to female intact swine with HF highlighting the importance of sex and disease state. Exercise training did not impact ACE2 or TMPRSS2 mRNA levels irrespective of tissue. In conclusion, these results suggest differences in RV, LV and coronary mRNA levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are dependent upon sex and comorbidities. TMPRSS2 levels are additionally influenced by pig species and pressure-overload. These results provide insight into how ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels may influence the cardiovascular involvement of SARS-COV-2 infection in an experimental setting of pre-clinical HF incorporating different swine species, sex, and comorbidities.","Kelly, Shannon Thorne Pamela Leary Emily Emter Craig",The FASEB Journal,,583
448143,HIV self-testing partially filled the HIV testing gap among men who have sex with men in China during the COVID-19 pandemic: results from an online survey,2021,"We are currently facing a highly critical case of a world-wide pandemic. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, a.k.a. COVID-19) has proved to be extremely contagious and the original outbreak from Asia has now spread to all continents. This situation will fruitfully profit from the study in regards of the spread of the virus, assessing effective countermeasures to weight the impact of the adopted strategies. The standard Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model is a very successful and widely used mathematical model for predicting the spread of an epidemic. We adopt the SIR model on a random network and extend the model to include control strategies {\em lockdown} and {\em testing} -- two often employed mitigation strategies. The ability of these strategies in controlling the pandemic spread is investigated by varying the effectiveness with which they are implemented. The possibility of a second outbreak is evaluated in detail after the mitigation strategies are withdrawn. We notice that, in any case, a sudden interruption of such mitigation strategies will likely induce a resurgence of a second outbreak, whose peak will be correlated to the number of susceptible individuals. In fact, we find that a population will remain vulnerable to the infection until the herd immunity is achieved. We also test our model with real statistics and information on the epidemic spread in South Korea, Germany, and New York and find a remarkable agreement with the simulation data.","Priyanka,; Verma, Vicky",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14373v1.pdf,583

449790,Youth mental health in the time of COVID-19,2020,"Importance: The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) indicated that urgent or emergent vitreoretinal surgical procedures should continue during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although decreases in the frequency of critical procedures have been reported outside the field of ophthalmology, analyses are limited by volume, geography, and time. Objective: To evaluate whether the frequency of ophthalmic surgical procedures deemed urgent or emergent by the AAO changed across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: Vitreoretinal practices from 17 institutions throughout the US participated in this multicenter cross-sectional study. The frequency of 11 billed vitreoretinal Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes across respective weeks was obtained from each practice between January 1, 2019, and May 31, 2020. Data were clustered into intravitreal injections (code 67028), lasers and cryotherapy (codes 67141, 67145, and 67228), retinal detachment (RD) repairs (codes 67107, 67108, 67110, and 67113), and other vitrectomies (codes 67036, 67039, and 67040). Institutions were categorized by region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West Coast), practice setting (academic [tax-exempt] or private [non-tax-exempt]), and date of respective statewide stay-at-home orders. Main Outcomes and Measures: Nationwide changes in the frequency of billing for urgent or emergent vitreoretinal surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 526â¯536 CPT codes were ascertained: 483â¯313 injections, 19â¯257 lasers or cryotherapy, 14â¯949 RD repairs, and 9017 other vitrectomies. Relative to 2019, a weekly institutional decrease in injections was observed from March 30 to May 2, 2020, with a maximal 38.6% decrease (from a mean [SD] of 437.8 [436.3] to 273.8 [269.0] injections) from April 6 to 12, 2020 (95% CI, -259 to -69 injections; P = .002). A weekly decrease was also identified that spanned a longer interval, at least until study conclusion (March 16 to May 31, 2020), for lasers and cryotherapy, with a maximal 79.6% decrease (from a mean [SD] of 6.6 [7.7] to 1.5 [2.0] procedures) from April 6 to 12, 2020 (95% CI, -6.8 to -3.3 procedures; P < .001), for RD repairs, with a maximal 59.4% decrease (from a mean [SD] of 3.5 [4.0] to 1.6 [2.2] repairs) from April 13 to 19, 2020 (95% CI, -2.7 to -1.4 repairs; P < .001), and for other vitrectomies, with a maximal 84.3% decrease (from a mean [SD] of 3.0 [3.1] to 0.4 [0.8] other vitrectomies) from April 6 to 12, 2020 (95% CI, -3.3 to -1.8 other vitrectomies; P < .001). No differences were identified by region, setting, or state-level stay-at-home order adjustment. Conclusions and Relevance: Although the AAO endorsed the continued performance of urgent or emergent vitreoretinal surgical procedures, the frequency of such procedures throughout the country experienced a substantial decrease that may persist after the COVID-19 pandemic's initial exponential growth phase. This decrease appears independent of region, setting, and state-level stay-at-home orders. It is unknown to what extent vitreoretinal intervention would have decreased without AAO recommendations, and how the decrease is associated with outcomes. Although safety is paramount during the COVID-19 pandemic, practices should consider prioritizing availability for managing high-acuity conditions until underlying reasons for the reduction are fully appreciated.","Breazzano, Mark P; Nair, Archana A; Arevalo, J Fernando; Barakat, Mark R; Berrocal, Audina M; Chang, Jonathan S; Chen, Andrew; Eliott, Dean; Garg, Sunir J; Ghadiali, Quraish; Gong, Dan; Grewal, Dilraj S; Handa, James T; Henderson, Matthew; Leiderman, Yannek I; Leng, Theodore; Mannina, Amar; Mendel, Thomas A; Mustafi, Debarshi; de Koo, Lisa C Olmos; Patel, Shriji N; Patel, Tapan P; Prenner, Jonathan; Richards, Paige; Singh, Rishi P; Wykoff, Charles C; Yannuzzi, Nicolas A; Yu, Hannah; Modi, Yasha S; Chang, Stanley",JAMA Ophthalmol,,583

This was a prospective clinical trial on non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 (>18 years) who had severe microsmia or anosmia within two weeks. The subjects were randomly assigned to the mometasone furoate group (100 mcg twice daily) or sodium chloride group (0.9%); both groups also received olfactory training for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was the improvement of the olfactory score at the end of the study. Visual analog scale (VAS) and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) were used to assess primary outcome. A total of 80 patients were recruited, 77 of them completed the study and were analyzed. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of demographics and baseline clinical characteristics. The olfactory scores (based on VAS) at weekly intervals showed a significant difference between the two groups (P:0.318, <0.001, <0.001, <0.001, respectively). The analyses also showed significant within-group differences from baseline. Nevertheless, the changes were not significant between the two groups (P: 0.444, 0.402, 0.267, 0.329). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the UPSIT results (p > 0.239). However, a significant between-group difference was noted in the severity of loss of smell (P < 0.001). Compared to olfactory training, mometasone furoate nasal spray combination with olfactory training showed a higher improvement in severe chronic anosmia by COVID-19.","Kasiri, Hossein; Rouhani, Nima; Salehifar, Ebrahim; Ghazaeian, Monireh; Fallah, Sahar",Int Immunopharmacol,,583

454251,The impact of physical activity on psychological health during Covid-19 pandemic in Italy,2020,"Graphite felt is a widely used electrode material for vanadium redox flow batteries. Electrode activation leads to the functionalization of the graphite surface with epoxy, OH, C=O, and COOH oxygenic groups and changes the carbon surface morphology and electronic structure; thus, improving the electrode's electroactivity relative to the untreated graphite. In this study, we conduct density functional theory (DFT) calculations to evaluate functionalization's role towards the positive half-cell reaction of the vanadium redox flow battery. The DFT calculations show that oxygenic groups improve the graphite felt's affinity towards the VO2+/VO2+ redox couple in the following order: C=O > COOH > OH > basal plane. Projected density of states (PDOS) calculations show that these groups increase the electrode's sp3 hybridization in the same order. We conclude that the increase in the sp3 hybridization is responsible for the improved electroactivity, while the oxygenic groups' presence is responsible for this sp3 increment. These insights can help in the better selection of activation processes and optimization of their parameters.","Hassan, Ali; Haile, Asnake Sahele; Tzedakis, Theodore; Hansen, Heine Anton; de Silva, Piotr","ChemSusChem (Weinh., Internet)",,583
454549,Negotiating Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Performing Migrant Domestic Work in Contentious Conditions,2021,"Due to the continuing high impact of lung diseases on society and the emergence of new respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, there is a great need for in vitro lung models that more accurately recapitulate the in vivo situation than current models based on lung epithelial cell cultures on stiff membranes. Therefore, we developed an in vitro airway epithelial-endothelial cell culture model based on Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells and human lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMVECs), cultured on opposite sides of flexible porous poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) membranes. Calu-3 cells, cultured for two weeks at an air-liquid interface (ALI), showed good expression of the tight junction (TJ) protein Zonula Occludens 1 (ZO-1). LMVECs cultured submerged for three weeks were CD31-positive, but the expression was diffuse and not localized at the cell membrane. Barrier functions of the Calu-3 cell cultures and the co-cultures with LMVECs were good, as determined by electrical resistance measurements and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dextran) permeability assays. Importantly, the Calu-3/LMVEC co-cultures showed better cell viability and barrier function than mono-cultures. Moreover, there was no evidence for epithelial- and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT and EndoMT, respectively) based on staining for the mesenchymal markers vimentin and &#945;-SMA, respectively. These results indicate the potential of this new airway epithelial-endothelial model for lung research. In addition, since the PTMC membrane is flexible, the model can be expanded by introducing cyclic stretch for enabling mechanical stimulation of the cells. Furthermore, the model can form the basis for biomimetic airway epithelial-endothelial and alveolar-endothelial models with primary lung epithelial cells.","Pasman, Thijs; Baptista, Danielle; van Riet, Sander; Truckenmüller, Roman K; Hiemstra, Pieter S; Rottier, Robbert J; Hamelmann, Naomi M; Paulusse, Jos M J; Stamatialis, Dimitrios; Poot, André A",,,583
454822,Organizational and External Factors Associated with Video Telehealth Use in the Veterans Health Administration Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the risk of infection of children with that of adults and to explore risk factors of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by following up close contacts of COVID-19 patients. METHOD: The retrospective cohort study was performed among close contacts of index cases diagnosed with COVID-19 in Guangzhou, China. Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms and exposure information were extracted. Logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the risk factors. The restricted cubic spline was conducted to examine to the dose-response relationship between age and SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The secondary attack rate (SAR) was 4.4% in 1,344 close contacts. The group of household contacts (17.2%) had the highest SAR. The rare-frequency contact (p < 0.001) and moderate-frequency contact (p < 0.001) were associated with lower risk of infection. Exposure to index cases with dry cough symptoms was associated with infection in close contacts (p = 0.004). Compared with children, adults had a significantly increased risk of infection (p = 0.014). There is a linear positive correlation between age and infection (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Children are probably less susceptible to COVID-19. Close contacts with frequent contact with patients and those exposed to patients with cough symptoms are associated with an increased risk of infection.","Hu, Peipei; Ma, Mengmeng; Jing, Qinlong; Ma, Yu; Gan, Lin; Chen, Yan; Liu, Jundi; Wang, Dahu; Zhang, Zhoubin; Zhang, Dingmei",Int J Infect Dis,,583
455018,Mathematical modelling and projecting the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Europe,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a great concern on both public and veterinary health. Multiple studies showed that the SARS-CoV-2 can persist for few days in wet condition, but it has not been clear whether the virus can maintain the infectivity in dry condition. Thus, we measured the infectious titer of dried SARS-CoV-2 (104 pfu/25 µL droplet) at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 24, and 48 h. Strikingly, the dried SARS-CoV-2 virus did not lose the infectivity to Vero E6 cells for up to 48 h. Our findings warrants that the drying cannot replace the surface disinfection to prevent transmission via common vehicle or nosocomial infection. Future studies can apply our experimental setting to test the efficacy of diverse disinfecting procedures.","Jang, Hyesun; Ross, Ted M",Vet Microbiol,,583

BACKGROUND: IPE is a highly purified and stable omega-3 fatty acid prescription medication that is approved for cardiovascular risk reduction in high-risk adults on statin therapy with elevated triglycerides. Preclinical data and clinical observations suggest that IPE may have pleiotropic effects including antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties that may prevent or reduce the downstream sequelae and cardiopulmonary consequences of viral URIs. METHODS: MITIGATE is a virtual, electronic health record-based, open-label, randomized, pragmatic clinical trial enrolling â¼16,500 participants within Kaiser Permanente Northern California - a fully integrated and learning health care delivery system with 21 hospitals and >255 ambulatory clinics serving â¼4.5 million members. Adults &#8805;50 years with established ASCVD and no prior history of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be prospectively identified and pre-randomized in a 1:10 allocation ratio (â¼ 1,500 IPE: â¼15,000 usual care) stratified by age and previous respiratory health status to the intervention (IPE 2 grams by mouth twice daily with meals) vs the control group (usual care) for a minimum follow-up duration of 6 months. The co-primary endpoints are moderate-to-severe laboratory-confirmed viral URI and worst clinical status due to a viral URI at any point in time. CONCLUSION: The MITIGATE study will inform clinical practice by providing evidence on the real-world clinical effectiveness of pretreatment with IPE to prevent and/or reduce the sequelae of laboratory-confirmed viral URIs in a high-risk cohort of patients with established ASCVD.","Ambrosy, Andrew P; Malik, Umar I; Thomas, Rachel C; Parikh, Rishi V; Tan, Thida C; Goh, Choon H; Selby, Van N; Solomon, Matthew D; Avula, Harshith R; Fitzpatrick, Jesse K; Skarbinski, Jacek; Philip, Sephy; Granowitz, Craig; Bhatt, Deepak L; Go, Alan S",Am Heart J,,583
455872,PMH4 The Psychological and Behavioral Responses to Covid-19 Epidemic in Pregnant Women in China: A Nationwide Survey,2020,"The use of Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI) devices in the upper zones of occupied buildings has gained increased attention as one of the most effective mitigation technologies for the transmission of COVID-19. To ensure safe and effective use of upper-room UVGI, it is necessary to devise a simulation technique that enables engineers, designers, and users to explore the impact of different design and operational parameters. We have developed a simulation technique for calculating UV-C fluence rate within the volume of the upper zone and planar irradiance in the lower occupied zone. Our method is based on established ray-tracing light simulation methods adapted to the UV-C wavelength range. We have included a case study of a typical hospital patient room. In it, we explored the impact of several design parameters: ceiling height, device location, room configuration, proportions, and surface materials. We present a spatially mapped parametric study of the UV-C irradiance distribution in three dimensions. We found that the ceiling height and mounting height of the UVGI fixtures combined can cause the largest variation (up to 22%) in upper zone fluence rate. One of the most important findings of this study is that it is crucial to consider interreflections in the room. This is because surface reflectance is the design parameter with the largest impact on the occupant exposure in the lower zone: Applying materials with high reflectance ratio in the upper portion of the room has the highest negative impact (over 700% variation) on increasing hot spots that may receive over 6 mJ/cm2 UV dose in the lower occupied zone.","Hou, Miaomiao; Pantelic, Jovan; Aviv, Dorit",Indoor air,,583

Study of the validity and reliability of the discourse approach for the psycholinguistic understanding of the nature, structure, and features of the linguistic consciousness functioning. Materials & Methods. This paper analyzes artificial neural network models built on the corpus of texts, which were obtained in the process of experimental research of the coronavirus quarantine concept as a new category of linguistic consciousness. The methodology of feedforward artificial neural networks (multilayer perception) was used in order to assess the possibility of predicting the leading texts semantics based on the discourses ranks and their place in the respective linear sequence. Same baseline parameters were used to predict respondents' self-assessments of changes in their psychological well-being and in daily life routine during the quarantine, as well as to predict their preferences of the quarantine strategies. The study relied on basic ideas about discourse as a meaning constituted by the dispersion of other meanings (Foucault). The same dispersion mechanism realizes itself in interdiscourse interaction, forming a discursive formation at a higher level. The method of T-units (Hunt) was used to identify and count discourses in the texts. The ranking of discourses was provided based on the criterion of their semantic-syntactic autonomy. Results. The conducted neural network modeling revealed a high accuracy in predicting the work of the linguistic consciousness functions associated with retrospective self-assessment and anticipatory imagination of the respondents. Another result of this modeling is a partial confirmation of the assumption concerning existence a relationship between the structural parameters of the discursive field (the rank of the discourses and their place in the respective linear sequence) and the leading semantics of the text. Conclusions. A discourse approach to the study of linguistic consciousness, understanding of its structure and functioning features seems to be reasonably appropriate. The implementation of the approach presupposes the need to form a base of linguistic corpora with the inclusion in each text markup of such parameters as: the presence of specific discourses, their ranks, positions in the linear sequence of discourses.","Shymko, V.",Psycholinguistics,,583

456486,Incarceration And COVID-19: The Authors Reply,2021,"This paper examines the frequency of spillovers between crude oil futures and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) stock markets. We use the methodologies proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and Baruník and Křehlík (2018) and the wavelet coherency approach. The results show time-varying volatility spillovers in the considered markets. The short-term spillovers are higher than their intermediate-term counterparts. The highest jump in spillovers occurs during the COVID-19 outbreak, followed by the global financial crisis and the recent oil price crash. The spillovers are higher for oil-exporting countries than oil-importing countries. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are the main contributors to spillovers in the short and intermediate terms. Brent oil, Egypt, Morocco, and Turkey are the net receivers of spillovers in the short term, and they switch to become net contributors to spillovers in the intermediate term. Turkey and oil-exporting stock markets receive more spillovers than oil-importing stock markets irrespective of the time frequency. Wavelet analysis shows evidence of co-movements between oil futures and stock markets at intermediate and low frequencies. The lead–lag relationships between crude oil and stock markets are mixed and time-varying. Moreover, a mixed portfolio offers diversification benefits. Hedging is more expensive during the pandemic period and particularly in the intermediate term compared to the short term. Hedging effectiveness is highest during the COVID-19 pandemic in the short and intermediate terms for almost all markets.","Mensi, Walid Al-Yahyaee Khamis Hamed Vo Xuan Vinh Kang Sang Hoon",Economic Analysis and Policy,,583

The problem is exacerbated by biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens on the surfaces of indwelling medical and dental devices that facilitate high levels of tolerance to antibiotics. The development of new antibacterial nanostructured surfaces shows excellent prospects for application in medicine as next-generation biomaterials. The physico-mechanical interactions between these nanostructured surfaces and bacteria lead to bacterial killing or prevention of bacterial attachment and subsequent biofilm formation, and thus are promising in circumventing bacterial infections. This Review explores the impact of surface roughness on the nanoscale in preventing bacterial colonization of synthetic materials and categorizes the different mechanisms by which various surface nanopatterns exert the necessary physico-mechanical forces on the bacterial cell membrane that will ultimately result in cell death.","Linklater, Denver P; Baulin, Vladimir A; Juodkazis, Saulius; Crawford, Russell J; Stoodley, Paul; Ivanova, Elena P",,,583
458550,Survey-reported medication changes among older adults during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic,2020,"The challenges presented by the global COVID-19 pandemic have intensified the stressors placed on nurses, leading to burnout. Oncology nurse burnout is likely to be an increasingly significant issue for cancer services as the true cost of the pandemic is revealed. Delays in diagnosis and treatment of cancers are reported widely, inevitably leading to poor prognosis and more aggressive treatments for patients. Gaining a better understanding of oncology nurse burnout, its prevalence and causes as well as strategies to reduce or prevent it will help to improve patient care and support staff wellbeing during and after the pandemic. Methodology: A search of the literature related to oncology nurse burnout, covering North America and Europe over 5 years (August 2014-January 2020), resulted in 31 articles for review. None of the studies were carried out in the UK, suggesting a need for robust investigations into oncology nurse burnout in the British health service. Summary: The prevalence of burnout among oncology nurses before the COVID-19 outbreak appeared to be high and is likely to have increased as a result of the pandemic. However, the studies investigating oncology nurse burnout are small and cross-sectional, with low-quality methods. The literature suggests the major causes of burnout arise in the workplace, particularly aspects of the environment that prevent nurses from working according to their values. Although burnout is frequently attributed to workplace factors, interventions remain focused on individuals' coping mechanisms and rarely on the workplace factors that are known to cause it.","Nwanya, Melanie; Rowberry, Deborah",Br J Nurs,,583
459037,Use PROSEVA study criteria not COVID-19 phenotype to guide proning treatment decisions,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), has resulted in a significant loss of human life due in part to the paucity of therapeutic options for treatment of the disease. The Spike glycoprotein is responsible for the attachment and infection of host cell and as such it is the target of many countermeasures including vaccines. Most of these therapeutics focus only on the ectodomain of the protein leaving the cytosolic domain of the Spike protein largely unexplored. Our study focuses on the cytosolic domain of the Spike protein as it conserved amongst coronaviruses. This domain contains numerous highly conserved cysteine (cys) residues that are potential sites of S-palmitoylation;a post-translational modification mediated by the host enzymes (palmitoyltransferases) that add palmitate to the target protein. In other coronaviruses, palmitoylation of the cytosolic domain of the Spike protein is required for its partitioning into de novo synthesized viral progeny. Here we investigated the cytosolic domain of Spike and its interaction with the protein palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC5. We have found that the Spike protein is palmitoylated on multiple juxtamembrane cysteine residues. Additionally, increased abundance of ZDHHC5 resulted in hyper-palmitoylation of Spike while silencing of ZDHHC5 reduced palmitoylation as well as the ability of the human coronavirus 229E to form viral plaques in cell monolayers. We used a fatty acid synthase inhibitor TVB-3166 to reduce palmitoyl-CoA levels which in turn eliminated palmitoylation of SARS-CoV2 Spike. Treating cells with TVB-3166 attenuates the ability of human coronavirus 229E to form plaques and promoted the survival of mice from a lethal murine coronavirus infection. Thus, inhibition of the Spike protein palmitoylation has the potential to treat SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections.","Mekhail, Katrina",The FASEB Journal,,583

All dentist were members of the Swiss Dental Association SSO from all over Switzerland-including all Swiss cantons and Liechtenstein-and received a previously calibrated questionnaire as an ad hoc online version. The questionnaire was divided into four parts: personal data; precautionary measures; awareness; perception. In total, 1324 questionnaires were analyzed; the response rate was 30.59% (ntotal = 4328). Participants stated in less than 2% common symptoms/signs of COVID-19; of which only fatigue was statistically significant (p < 0.01). A small number of dentists reported a positive test (0.91%; n = 12) or having one or more symptoms (2.65%; n = 35) of COVID-19 during the pandemic; whereas only 6.71% (n = 87) of the participants reported having treated SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. High prevalence areas were only medium-large and large Swiss cantons (p < 0.01). Face filter (FFP2/FFP3) masks were used by about half of the dentists, while disposable visor was rarely used. The majority of dentists had to reduce the dental practice activity to a minimum of 0-10% (n = 923; 69.98%) due to the lockdown. This economic impact forced 1.4% (n = 18) to close their practice permanently or by the end of 2020 due to the economic situation. These results can be helpful to better prepare dental practices for future outbreaks of infection (e.g., prophylactic storage of additional protective measures), define the best strategy and organize the dental workforce. Political decision-makers should consider drastic economic effects when deciding on drastic measures such as ""lockdown"", which can lead to practice closures and unemployment of dental staff after only a few weeks. This should be taken into account, especially with regard to possible financial assistance to severely impaired dental practices to maintain a high level of dental care.","Wolf, Thomas Gerhard; Zeyer, Oliver; Campus, Guglielmo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,583

It is has resulted in and continues in over a million deaths worldwide and halted medical systems and particularly elective surgeries worldwide. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of the initial COVID-19 pandemic months on orthopaedic surgeons in British Columbia. METHODS: The study surveyed (June until August 2020) 187 orthopaedic surgeons in British Columbia affiliated with the University of British Columbia or the British Columbia Orthopaedic Association using an online survey to help identify the impact of COVID-19 on patient care, work and personal life. RESULTS: Eighty-seven out of 187 (46.5%) orthopaedic surgeons participated in the online survey. All types of surgeries were completely cancelled for 23 respondents. Elective surgeries were cancelled for most respondents (in-hospital n = 38 and/or ambulatory n = 32). Trauma cases were reduced according to 35 respondents. Outpatient clinics were stopped initially and transferred in virtual clinics (telemedicine). Approximately 40% of respondents were afraid of infecting others (patients, family) and 25% admitted to drink more heavily. Ninety percent of respondents reported an income loss of > 15% (range 0-100%). CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic surgeons and their patients have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Cancellation of surgeries has created an increased backlog of 32,400 orthopaedic surgeries in British Columbia. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has expedited the implementation of telemedicine, which will be a long-lasting benefit in providing healthcare.","Simon, Maciej J K; Regan, William D",J Orthop Surg Res,,583

Features of the pathophysiology and clinical presentation partially distinguish it from 'classical' ARDS. A Research and Development (RAND) analysis gauged the opinion of an expert panel about the management of ARDS with and without COVID-19 as the precipitating cause, using recent UK guidelines as a template. METHODS: An 11-person panel comprising intensive care practitioners rated the appropriateness of ARDS management options at different times during hospital admission, in the presence or absence of, or varying severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection on a scale of 1-9 (where 1-3 is inappropriate, 4-6 is uncertain and 7-9 is appropriate). A summary of the anonymised results was discussed at an online meeting moderated by an expert in RAND methodology. The modified online survey comprising 76 questions, subdivided into investigations (16), non-invasive respiratory support (18), basic intensive care unit management of ARDS (20), management of refractory hypoxaemia (8), pharmacotherapy (7) and anticoagulation (7), was completed again. RESULTS: Disagreement between experts was significant only when addressing the appropriateness of diagnostic bronchoscopy in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Adherence to existing published guidelines for the management of ARDS for relevant evidence-based interventions was recommended. Responses of the experts to the final survey suggested that the supportive management of ARDS should be the same, regardless of a COVID-19 diagnosis. For patients with ARDS with COVID-19, the panel recommended routine treatment with corticosteroids and a lower threshold for full anticoagulation based on a high index of suspicion for venous thromboembolic disease. CONCLUSION: The expert panel found no reason to deviate from the evidence-based supportive strategies for managing ARDS outlined in recent guidelines.","Griffiths, Mark; Meade, Susanna; Summers, Charlotte; McAuley, Daniel Francis; Proudfoot, Alastair; Baladia, Marta Montero; Dark, Paul M; Diomede, Kate; Finney, Simon J; Forni, Lui G; Meadows, Chris; Naldrett, Ian A; Patel, Brijesh; Perkins, Gavin D; Samaan, Mark A; Sharifi, Laurence; Suntharalingam, Ganesh; Tarmey, Nicholas T; Young, Harriet F; Wise, Matt P; Irving, Peter M",Thorax,,583

Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) in Singapore has routinely fit-tested staff for high-filtration N95 respirators and established Web-based staff surveillance systems. The routine systems were enhanced in response to Singapore's first imported COVID-19 case on 23 January 2020. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study from 23 January to 23 February 2020 among healthcare workers to evaluate the effectiveness of the staff protection and surveillance strategy in TTSH, a 1600-bed multidisciplinary acute-care hospital colocated with the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). As of 23 February 2020, TTSH/NCID has managed 76% of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore. The hospital adopted a multipronged approach to protect and monitor staff with potential COVID-19 exposures: (1) risk-based personal protective equipment, (2) staff fever and sickness surveillance, and (3) enhanced medical surveillance of unwell staff. RESULTS: A total of 10 583 staff were placed on hospitalwide fever and sickness surveillance, with 1524 frontline staff working in COVID-19 areas under close surveillance. Among frontline staff, a median of 8 staff illness episodes was seen per day; almost 10% (n = 29) resulted in hospitalization. None of the staff was found to be infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: A robust staff protection and health surveillance system that is routinely implemented during non-outbreak periods and enhanced during the COVID-19 outbreak is effective in protecting frontline staff from the infection.","Htun, Htet Lin; Lim, Dwee Wee; Kyaw, Win Mar; Loh, Wan-Ning Janis; Lee, Lay Tin; Ang, Brenda; Chow, Angela",Clin Infect Dis,,583

Daily inpatient antimicrobial therapy is an alternative to hospitalization, which is similar to OPAT; patients go home after they are administered antibiotics in a separate room in the hospital setting. OBJECTIVES: We assessed our previous daily inpatient practice to revitalize the model in the COVID-19 era. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical and microbiological responses and the cost effectiveness of the patients with cUTIs who received daily inpatient ertapenem therapy. RESULTS: Our study population was 136 patients in 156 episodes. It was a difficult-to-treat group with older age (mean 63.0 ± 14.8 years) and a high burden of underlying conditions (86.5%). The most common causative organisms were Escherichia coli (74.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.2%); 89.7% of the isolates were producing extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL). The microbiologic and clinical success rates were 82.1% and 95.5%, respectively. The patients required hospitalization in 16 episodes (10.2%) because of clinical failures (3.8%), superinfections (2%), planned invasive interventions (3.2%), and side effects (1.2%). Our university hospital saved 1608 bed-days and 2596  (9702 TL) bed costs. CONCLUSIONS: In the COVID-19 pandemic period, this seems to be an effective, safe, and cost-effective way to decrease hospitalizations for cUTIs in settings where OPAT is unavailable.","Nazli Zeka, Arzu; Avkan-Oguz, Vildan; Irmak, Caglar; Eren Kutsoylu, Oya; Alp Cavus, Sema; Kuruüzüm, Ziya; Ergon, M Cem",Int J Clin Pract,,583

However, its circulation dynamics in and through horses are still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate prevalence of C. burnetii and its genomic characteristics in horse sera samples in the North of Iran (Golestan Province). The samples were collected in 2018 and the age, sex, and breed of each animal were recorded. Nested-PCR was used to detect C. burnetii based on the presence of the transposable gene IS1111. The results showed that 7.50 % (P < 0.05; 95 % CI: 0.5 %-0.12 %) of the examined sera samples were positive for C. burnetii. Based on the resuls, prevalence of C. burnetii in the age groupof < Years 1-5 (p-value <0.05, 95 % CI: 1 %-8 %) was less than the age group of >6 years old (p-value <0.05, 95 %, CI: 7 %-19.8 %). In previous studies, it was concluded that the horses' population in Golestan Province should be considered as an important factor in the epidemiology of Q fever and consequently in public health. Further studies should be implemented to evaluate if horses may be relevant indicators of zoonotic risk in urban and suburban endemic areas.","Khademi, P; Ownagh, A; Ataei, B; Kazemnia, A; Eydi, J; Khalili, M; M, Mahzounieh; Mardani, K",Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,,583

To goal of this study was to measure neighborhood disadvantage and primary language effects on the risk of COVID-19 severity across and within racial/ethnic groups. Methods This retrospective cohort study analyzed health records of PCR+ COVID-19 patients across 12 Midwest hospitals and 60 clinics in Minnesota between March 4, 2020 to August 19, 2020. The main exposures include area deprivation index (ADI), and primary language. The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity using hospitalization within 45 days of diagnosis. Logistic and competing-risk regression models (censored at 45 days and accounting for the competing-risk of death prior to hospitalization) assessed the effects of neighborhood-level deprivation (using the ADI) and primary language. Within race, effects of ADI and primary language were measured using logistic regression. Results 5,577 COVID-19 patients were included, 866 (n=15.5%) were hospitalized within 45 days of diagnosis. Hospitalized patients were older (60.9 vs. 40.4 years, p&lt;0.001) and more likely to be male (n=425 [49.1%] vs. 2,049 [43.5%], p=0.002). Of those requiring hospitalization, 43.9% (n=381), 19.9% (n=172), 18.6% (n=161), and 11.8% (n=102) were White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic, respectively. Independent of ADI, minority race/ethnicity was associated with COVID-19 severity;Hispanic patients (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.72-5.30), Asians (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.74-3.29), and Blacks (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.15-1.94). ADI was not associated with hospitalization. Non-English speaking (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.51-2.43) significantly increased odds of hospital admission across and within minority groups. Conclusions Minority populations have increased odds of severe COVID-19 independent of neighborhood deprivation, a commonly suspected driver of disparate outcomes. Non-English-speaking accounts for differences across and within minority populations. These results support the continued concern that racism contributes to disparities during COVID-19 while also highlighting the underappreciated role primary language plays in COVID-19 severity amongst minority groups.

Logistic workers had the highest rate of SARS-CoV-2 (pâ¯=â¯0.002), but nurse technicians had the highest rate among those reporting routine contacts with patients (pâ¯=â¯0.001). Doctors presented the lowest rate of infection, although living in most affected districts (pâ¯<â¯0.001). Policies and adequate training for all hospital employees may improve the prevention of the infection among all health care service categories.","Faíco-Filho, Klinger Soares; Carvalho, Joseane Mayara Almeida; Conte, Danielle Dias; de Souza Luna, Luciano Kleber; Bellei, Nancy",Braz. j. infect. dis,,583
476057,Is COVID-19 lockdown associated with vitamin D deficiency?,2021,"Objective: To analyze the blood test indicators of patients after infection of COVID-19 in Chongqing and analyze the clinical indicators of 8 patients with diarrhea. Materials and Methods: From January 26, 2019 to February 13, 2020, 70 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV according to the World Health Organization interim guidance for NCP and divided into diarrhea and non-diarrhea groups. The laboratory tests liver and kidney function, blood routine, coagulation function, and immune status. Results: The study population included 70 hospitalized patients with confirmed CONV-2019. NCP patients (43males and 27 females) with a mean age of 48.57±17.80 (9~82) years and only 4.3% of patients have lung-related diseases. The positive rate of ESR, CRP, PT, IL6, lymphocyte count, GGT, Prealbumin and CD4 was more than 50%. We further analyzed the differences between 8 diarrhea patients and 62 non-diarrhea patients. Among these indicators, only Lymphocyte, CRP, Prealbumin and Cystatin C positive rate is more than 50%. Although there is no statistical difference in GGT, 100% of the 7 patients tested decreased. Conclusion: Our data recommended that the ESR, CRP, PT, IL6, lymphocyte count, GGT, prealbumin and CD4 have important value in the diagnosis of COVID-19, and the decrease of GGT may be an important indicator for judging the intestinal dysfunction of patients.","Wei, Xiao-Yu; Jing, Ding; Jia, Bei; Li, Qing; Zhou, Xia-Qia; Gong, Ming-Feng; Zou, Jing-Bo; Zhang, Qiang; Huang, Wen-Xiang; Tian, Wen-Guang",Int J Med Sci,,583
476087,Oral Health Matters: The Ethics of Providing Oral Health During COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in China, December 2019. The clinical features and treatment of COVID-19 patients remain largely elusive. However, accurate detection is required for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. We aimed to evaluate the antibodies-based test and nucleic acid-based test for SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 133 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, China, from January 23 to March 1, 2020. Demographic data, clinical records, laboratory tests, and outcomes were collected. Data were accessed by SARS-CoV-2 IgM-IgG antibody test and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) detection for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Of 133 COVID-19 patients, there were 44 moderate cases, 52 severe cases, and 37 critical cases with no differences in gender and age among three subgroups. In RT-PCR detection, the positive rate was 65.9%, 71.2%, and 67.6% in moderate, severe, and critical cases, respectively. Whereas the positive rate of IgM/IgG antibody detection in patients was 79.5%/93.2%, 82.7%/100%, and 73.0%/97.3% in moderate, severe, and critical cases, respectively. Moreover, the IgM and IgG antibodies concentrations were also examined with no differences among three subgroups. CONCLUSION: The IgM-IgG antibody test exhibited a useful adjunct to RT-PCR detection, and improved the accuracy in COVID-19 diagnosis regardless of the severity of illness, which provides an effective complement to the false-negative results from a nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis after onsets.","Liu, Rui; Liu, Xinghui; Yuan, Li; Han, Huan; Shereen, Muhammad Adnan; Zhen, Jiesheng; Niu, Zhili; Li, Dong; Liu, Fang; Wu, Kailang; Luo, Zhen; Zhu, Chengliang",Int Immunopharmacol,,583

These patients can experience rapid progression to profound hypoxemia and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Some patients, despite receiving lung-protective ventilation and maximal medical therapy, develop refractory hypoxemia, rendering candidates for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Centers with experience in this technique are available only in a few reference hospitals and some patients are too ill to be transferred with conventional mechanical ventilation so they need mobile ECMO (interhospital transport under ECMO). Here we report the first interhospital extracorporeal membrane oxygenation transport of a COVID-19 patient in Chile, showing that it is feasible and safe to transfer a COVID-19 patient under ECMO support if a mobile ECMO program is correctly implemented and the particularities of protective measures are properly taken.","Daniela, Martínez; Felipe, Salech; Van Nicolette, Sint Jan; Tomás, Regueira; Eli, Villalabeitia; Jorge, Rufs; Christian, Fajardo; Roberto, Castillo; Jose, Iñiguez; Luisa, Durán; Rodrigo, Díaz",J. artif. organs,,583

The rapid sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus facilitated identification of the receptor for angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the high affinity binding site that allows virus endocytosis. Parallel evidence that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease evolution shows greater lethality in patients with antecedent cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or even obesity questioned the potential unfavorable contribution of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blockers as facilitators of adverse outcomes due to the ability of these therapies to augment the transcription of Ace2 with consequent increase in protein formation and enzymatic activity. We review, here, the specific studies that support a role of these agents in altering the expression and activity of ACE2 and underscore that the robustness of the experimental data is associated with weak clinical long-term studies of the existence of a similar regulation of tissue or plasma ACE2 in human subjects.","Ferrario, Carlos M; Ahmad, Sarfaraz; Groban, Leanne",Clin Sci (Lond),,583

Shortages in healthcare staff and manpower bring the practical skills of medical students under the spotlight. However, before they can be placed on hospital frontlines, it is crucial to assess their preparedness for patient interaction. This can be achieved by comparing their behavioral dynamics to those of physicians. An online questionnaire was administered between March 20, 2020 and March 27, 2020. The preventive strategies adopted by medical students and physicians at different ages and levels of education were compared by using chi-square test where a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We report that the demonstration of preventive behaviors increased with educational attainment and age. Older age groups avoided crowded areas, wore more masks, used disinfectants and did not touch their faces as compared to the younger participants (p < 0.001). Similarly, postgraduate doctors used more masks and disinfectants as compared to graduate doctors and medical students (p < 0.001). Based on our results, the lack of preventive behavior shown by medical students has implications for policy makers. We recommend short- and long-term changes to medical programs and admissions policies to equip medical students with the personal and professional skills to better contribute to the healthcare system in the present pandemic and beyond.","Haque, Ayesha; Mumtaz, Sadaf; Khattak, Osama; Mumtaz, Rafia; Ahmed, Amal",,,583

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective population cohort study of hospital admissions in New Zealand between 23 April and 27 May 1988-2018. We compared acute and arranged hospitalisation and mortality rates in holiday (Anzac Day Monday to Friday) and non-holiday (Anzac Day Saturday or Sunday) years, for mid-week holidays and long weekends; and measured total weekly average acute and arranged hospitalisation counts. RESULTS: Hospitalisation rates were lower in holiday years than non-holiday years (rate ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.96, p<0.001), with fewer arranged admissions (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.94, p<0.001), but no significant difference for acute admissions (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.00, p=0.087). Holiday year acute admission rates were lower than non-holiday years for children aged 0-4 years, but higher for adults aged 15-44 years. Holidays reduced arranged admissions most in children and areas of higher socioeconomic deprivation. There was no significant difference for mortality. Average weekly acute hospitalisations were higher than arranged admissions between 10 June and 7 October. CONCLUSION: Secondary holidays do not reduce deaths; or acute hospital admissions except in the holiday week; and may delay elective treatment. However, if New Zealand is to add a new public holiday, it would have least detrimental health effect scheduled between 10 June and 7 October.","Telfar Barnard, Lucy Frances",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,583

TPCs are involved in various pathophysiological processes, including cell growth and development, metabolism, and cancer progression. Most studies of TPCs have used TPC-/- cell or whole-animal models, or Ned-19, an indirect inhibitor. The TPC activation mechanism remains controversial, which has made it difficult to develop selective modulators. Recent studies of TPC structure and their interactomes are aiding the development of direct pharmacological modulators. This process is still in its infancy, but will facilitate future research and TPC targeting for therapeutical purposes. Here, we review the progress of current research into TPCs, including recent insights into their structures, functional roles, mechanisms of activation, and pharmacological modulators.","Jin, Xuhui; Zhang, Yuxuan; Alharbi, Abeer; Hanbashi, Ali; Alhoshani, Ali; Parrington, John",Trends Pharmacol Sci,,583

480067,Anxiety and Its Associated Factors During the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia,2021,"Infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is mediated by the binding of its spike protein to the membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which plays a pivotal role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The understanding of RAS dysregulation due to this viral infection is of fundamental importance to better understand the pathogenic mechanisms and risk factors of the coronavirus disease COVID-19, and to design effective therapeutic strategies. To address this issue, we built a mathematical model of RAS based on data about protein and peptide concentrations in normotensive and hypertensive individuals. We first tested our model on clinical data on the action of antihypertensive RAS-blocking drugs in control individuals. Despite the simplicity of our model, it reproduces very well, without any fitting of additional parameters, the impact of a series of drugs, i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), direct renin inhibitors (DRI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). We applied our model to analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the RAS system, which we modeled through a downregulation of ACE2 related to viral load. Moreover, we analyzed the effect of RAS-blockers and other RAS-targeting drugs, i.e. human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2) and angiotensin 1-7 peptide (Ang1-7), on the RAS system of normotensive and hypertensive COVID-19 patients. We found that while ACE-I, DRI, rhACE2 and Ang1-7 tend to improve the clinical outcomes in a tension-dependent manner, the use of ARB appears to worsen it. The mathematical model that we developed offers the interesting possibility of testing in silico the RAS dysregulation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and of predicting how risk factors as well as different drugs, alone or in combination, impact on RAS and disease severity.","Pucci, Fabrizio; Bogaerts, Philippe; Rooman, Marianne",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02772v1.pdf,583

However, we lack insights into local communities' experiences in coping with the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study explored both the impact of, and response to, COVID-19 within the Orthodox Jewish communities of Antwerp (Belgium) during the first lockdown period (March 2020 - May 2020). METHODS: We conducted an explorative qualitative study using a participatory approach. First, we performed a community mapping to identify relevant stakeholders. Through the active involvement of a community advisory board and based on qualitative interviews with key-informants and community members, we elicited lived experiences, attitudes, and perceptions towards COVID-19. Interviews were conducted both face-to-face and using online web conferencing technology. Data were analyzed inductively according to the principles of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Government-issued outbreak control measures presented context-specific challenges to the Orthodox Jewish communities in Antwerp. They related mainly to the remote organization of religious life, and practicing physical distancing in socially and culturally strongly connected communities. Existing community resources were rapidly mobilized to adapt to the outbreak and to self-organize response initiatives within communities. The active involvement of community and religious leaders in risk communication proved to be of great importance to facilitate the coverage and uptake of pandemic control measures while protecting essential community values and traditions. Creating bottom-up and community-adapted communication strategies, including addressing language barriers and involving Rabbis in the dissemination of prevention messages, fostered a feeling of trust in government's response measures. However, unmet information and prevention needs were also identified, such as the need for inclusive communication by public authorities and the need to mitigate the negative effects of stigmatization. CONCLUSION: The experiences of Orthodox Jewish communities in Antwerp demonstrate a valuable example of a feasible community-centered approach to health emergencies. Increasing the engagement of communities in local decision-making and governance structures remains a key strategy to respond to unmet information and prevention needs.","Vanhamel, Jef; Meudec, Marie; Van Landeghem, Ella; Ronse, Maya; Gryseels, Charlotte; Reyniers, Thijs; Rotsaert, Anke; Ddungu, Charles; Manirankunda, Lazare; Katsuva, Deogratias; Grietens, Koen Peeters; Nöstlinger, Christiana",Int J Equity Health,,583

The objective of the work is to identify SARS-CoV2 spike variants that emerged during the pandemic and evaluate their binding affinity with ACE2. Evolutionary analysis of 2178 SARS-CoV2 genomes identifies RBD variants that are under selection bias. The binding efficacy of these RBD variants to the ACE2 has been analyzed by using protein-protein docking and binding free energy calculations. Pan-proteomic analysis reveals 113 mutations among them 33 are parsimonious. Evolutionary analysis reveals five RBD variants A348T, V367F, G476S, V483A, and S494P are under strong positive selection bias. Variations at these sites alter the ACE2 binding affinity. A348T, G476S, and V483A variants display reduced affinity to ACE2 in comparison to the Wuhan SARS-CoV2 spike protein. While the V367F and S494P population variants display a higher binding affinity towards human ACE2. Reorientation of several crucial residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface facilitates additional hydrogen bond formation for the V367F variant which enhances the binding energy during ACE2 recognition. On the other hand, the enhanced binding affinity of S494P is attributed to strong interfacial complementarity between the RBD and ACE2.","Chakraborty, Sandipan",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,583

Likewise, important measures have been adopted in healthcare and research centers aimed at halting the pandemic as soon as possible. The objective of this study is to gather the main aspects of the clinical research studies undertaken by the Departments of Hospital Pharmacy (DHP) of Spain during the COVID-19 crisis. The decision of the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy (SEFH) to sponsor CTs made it possible that 13% of DHP had been led at least one CT. The Spanish Agency for Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS), in coordination with Institutional Review Boards, has adopted a fast-track review procedure to accelerate authorizations for CTs related to the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. There have also been numerous public and private calls for financing research projects aimed at contributing to the fight against this virus. Despite the pandemic, actions have been taken to continue ongoing CTs and studies while the safety and well-being of patients are guaranteed.

485841,The Use of Digital Applications and COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: It is claimed that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a negative impact on mental health. However, to date, prospective studies are lacking. Moreover, it is important to identify which factors modulate the stress response to the pandemic. Previously, sense of coherence (SOC) has emerged as a particularly important resistance factor. OBJECTIVE: This prospective study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and to investigate the ability of pre-outbreak SOC levels to predict changes in psychopathological symptoms. METHODS: This study assessed psychopathological symptoms and SOC before and after the COVID-19 outbreak as well as post-outbreak COVID-19-related traumatic distress in a German-speaking sample (n =1,591). Bivariate latent change score (BLCS) modeling was used to analyze pre- to post-outbreak changes in psychopathological symptoms and the ability of SOC to predict symptom changes. RESULTS: Overall, there was no change in psychopathological symptoms. However, on an individual-respondent level, 10% experienced a clinically significant increase in psychopathological symptoms and 15% met cut-off criteria for COVID-19-related traumatic distress. Using BLCS modeling, we identified a high-stress group experiencing an increase in psychopathological symptoms and a decrease in SOC and a low-stress group showing the reversed pattern. Changes in SOC and psychopathological symptoms were predicted by pre-outbreak SOC and psychopathological symptom levels. CONCLUSIONS: Although mental health was stable in most respondents, a small group of respondents characterized by low levels of SOC experienced increased psychopathological symptoms from pre- to post-outbreak. Thus, SOC training might be a promising approach to enhance the resistance to stressors.","Schäfer, Sarah K; Sopp, M Roxanne; Schanz, Christian G; Staginnus, Marlene; Göritz, Anja S; Michael, Tanja",Psychother Psychosom,,583
486378,Can remotely supervised exercise positively affect self-reported depressive symptoms and physical activity levels during social distancing?,2021,"Human respiratory virus infections lead to a spectrum of respiratory symptoms and disease severity, contributing to substantial morbidity, mortality and economic losses worldwide, as seen in the COVID-19 pandemic. Belonging to diverse families, respiratory viruses differ in how easy they spread (transmissibility) and the mechanism (modes) of transmission. Transmissibility as estimated by the basic reproduction number (R0) or secondary attack rate is heterogeneous for the same virus. Respiratory viruses can be transmitted via four major modes of transmission: direct (physical) contact, indirect contact (fomite), (large) droplets and (fine) aerosols. We know little about the relative contribution of each mode to the transmission of a particular virus in different settings, and how its variation affects transmissibility and transmission dynamics. Discussion on the particle size threshold between droplets and aerosols and the importance of aerosol transmission for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus is ongoing. Mechanistic evidence supports the efficacies of non-pharmaceutical interventions with regard to virus reduction; however, more data are needed on their effectiveness in reducing transmission. Understanding the relative contribution of different modes to transmission is crucial to inform the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the population. Intervening against multiple modes of transmission should be more effective than acting on a single mode.","Leung, Nancy H L",Nat Rev Microbiol,,583

A triple aim for clinical research would (1) improve the individual research participant's experience; (2) promote the health of populations; and (3) reduce per capita costs of clinical research. Such an approach is possible by designing trials around the needs of participants rather than sites, embracing digital measures of health, and advancing decentralized studies. Recent studies, including those evaluating therapies for COVID-19, have demonstrated the value of such an approach. Accelerating the adoption of these methods can help fulfill this new triple aim of clinical research.","Dorsey, E Ray; Kieburtz, Karl",Clin Trials,,583

489006,"Patient flow, health delivery processes, and areas for improvement in the up health service (UPHS) during May to June 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"IntroductionNitric Oxide (NO) is an endogenous vasodilator that is synthesized by the vascular endothelium. Due to its vasodilatory effect and short half-life, the use of NO as an exogenous inhaled medication (iNO) to target the pulmonary vasculature, in conditions with increased pulmonary vascular resistance, has been studied. The use of iNO in patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 has therapeutic importance in improving oxygenation. It also has potential anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic properties. Herein, we want to share our experience of use of iNO in hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID 19 pneumonia. We hypothesized that iNO may be beneficial at preventing intubation, decreasing invasive mechanical ventilation duration, and consequently improve outcomes including hospital mortality. MethodsThis is a descriptive hypothesis generating study of patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia who received iNO for hypoxemic respiratory failure, at a single tertiary care center. We collected information on patient demographics, co-morbidities, iNO treatment, need for intubation, arterial blood gas analysis, laboratory values, hospital length of stay, and mortality. Patients were divided into two groups based on the timing of iNO administration: group 1 - ""pre-intubation"" (i.e. iNO started at least 1 day prior to endotracheal intubation, if any) and group 2 - ""post-intubation"" (i.e. iNO started on the same day as or after endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation). ResultA total of 45 (group 1, n=26 [57.8%] vs group2, n=19 [42.2%]) COVID 19 patients who had iNO use. The mean time from hospital admission to iNO administration(days) in group 1 was 2.1 ({+/-}1.8) vs 4.2 ({+/-}5.9) in group 2. The mean hospital length of stay from the beginning of iNO treatment until discharge or death was 18.3 vs 26.2 days, with 8 deaths (30.8%) vs 9 deaths (47.4%) in group 1 vs group 2, respectively. DiscussionOur study is unable to demonstrate comparably outcomes benefit of iNO. Although there was a trend towards decreased need for invasive mechanical ventilation in group 1[Only 11 (42.3%) patients were intubated out of 26 who received iNO early after hospital admission (2.3 days)], no statistical significance could be achieved because of small sample size. Our study demonstrated that iNO administration pre-intubation did not appear harmful and appears to be safe, complementary to HFNC, signalling the domain where systematic investigation is required to confirm or not the potential for iNO to improve patient outcomes in the management of COVID 19-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure. ConclusionThis study showcases the potential benefit of early pre-intubation use of iNO in COVID patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. This study could conclusively form the basis for a prospective trial and could have a tremendous impact in improving patient outcomes. HighlightsO_LIInhaled nitric oxide can be used in the treatment COVID 19 induced hypoxemic respiratory failure. C_LIO_LIInhaled nitric oxide use can lower the burden on overwhelmed medical system.

It results in increased vulnerability to chronic diseases. Despite growing clinical concerns about sarcopenia in an aging society, there are few validated biomarkers for age-related sarcopenia. We tested the potential of growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) as a biomarker for sarcopenia in mice and humans across wide age ranges. We used four groups of mice (6, 10, 14, and 18â¯months old) to explore the association between GDF-15 levels and age, muscle mass, and endurance capacity. Among those four groups, 6- and 18-month-old mice were exposed to 8â¯weeks of treadmill exercise. The GDF-15 levels were measured in serum and muscle at baseline and after exercise intervention. The body composition was assessed using animal dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). GDF-15 levels in tissue and serum increased with age in these mice. The serum levels of GDF-15 had a strong negative correlation with both muscle weight and exercise endurance capacity. Expression of GDF-15 in muscle also had a negative trend with muscle weight and endurance capacity. The muscle expression of GDF-15 was significantly attenuated after 8â¯weeks of exercise compared with the group without exercise, particularly in older mice. GDF-15 levels were also related to functional capacity and showed responses to therapeutic exercise intervention in this model. We also measured serum GDF-15 levels and muscle mass using DXA in healthy human adults (19 men and 18 women). As in mice, serum levels of GDF-15 were correlated positively with age, but negatively with muscle mass in these subjects. These findings support the potential of GDF-15 as a biomarker for age-related sarcopenia.","Kim, Hoyoun; Kim, Kyoung Min; Kang, Min Ji; Lim, Soo",Exp Gerontol,,583

METHODS: Two groups of COVID-19 patients were retrospectively screened on the basis of plasma sodium level at admission: hyponatremic (sodium < 135 mM, n = 92) or normonatremic (sodium &#8805; 135 mM, n = 198) patients. Pearson's chi-2 (qualitative variables) and Student's T tests (quantitative variables) were used to compare the two groups. A multiple logistic regression model was used to explore the association between patients' clinical data and outcomes. RESULTS: Hyponatremia was frequent but generally mild. There were more male patients in the hyponatremic group (p = 0.014). Pulmonary lesions on the first thoracic CT-scan performed during hospitalization were significantly more extensive in the hyponatremic group (p = 0.010). ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or death were significantly more frequent in hyponatremic compared to normonatremic patients (37 versus 14%; p < 0.001; 17 versus 6%; p = 0.003; 18 versus 9%, p = 0.042, respectively). Hyponatremia was an independent predictor of adverse outcomes (adjusted Odds-ratio: 2.77 [1.26-6.15, p = 0.011]). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed an independent relationship between hyponatremia at admission and transfer to ICU, use of mechanical ventilation or death in COVID-19 patients. Hyponatremia may reflect the severity of underlying pulmonary lesions. Our results support the use of sodium levels as a simple bedside screening tool for the early identification of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at high risk of poor outcome.","De Carvalho, Hugo; Letellier, Thibault; Karakachoff, Matilde; Desvaux, Geoffrey; Caillon, Hélène; Papuchon, Emmanuelle; Bentoumi-Loaec, Maxime; Benaouicha, Nesrine; Canet, Emmanuel; Chapelet, Guillaume; Le Turnier, Paul; Montassier, Emmanuel; Rouhani, Armine; Goffinet, Nicolas; Figueres, Lucile",J. nephrol,,583

Collectively these have become known as long COVID. Our aim was to first determine long COVID prevalence in 185 randomly surveyed COVID-19 patients and, subsequently, to determine if there was an association between occurrence of long COVID symptoms and reactivation of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) in 68 COVID-19 patients recruited from those surveyed. We found the prevalence of long COVID symptoms to be 30.3% (56/185), which included 4 initially asymptomatic COVID-19 patients who later developed long COVID symptoms. Next, we found that 66.7% (20/30) of long COVID subjects versus 10% (2/20) of control subjects in our primary study group were positive for EBV reactivation based on positive titers for EBV early antigen-diffuse (EA-D) IgG or EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM. The difference was significant (p &lt;0.001, Fisher’s exact test). A similar ratio was observed in a secondary group of 18 subjects 21–90 days after testing positive for COVID-19, indicating reactivation may occur soon after or concurrently with COVID-19 infection. These findings suggest that many long COVID symptoms may not be a direct result of the SARS-CoV-2 virus but may be the result of COVID-19 inflammation-induced EBV reactivation.","Gold, Jeffrey E.; Okyay, Ramazan A.; Licht, Warren E.; Hurley, David J.",Pathogens,,583

Getting Low-Income Adolescents and Young Adults in Baltimore Out of Transportation Deserts: Use of Ride-Sharing Services Before And During COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Background: As COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, early prevention and control of the epidemic is extremely important. Telemedicine, which includes medical advice given over telephone, Internet, mobile phone applications or other similar ways, may be an efficient way to reduce transmission and pressure on medical institutions. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, CBM, CNKI and Wanfang databases for literature on the use of telemedicine for COVID-19, SARS and MERS from their inception to March 31st, 2020. We included studies about the content of the consultation (such as symptoms, therapy and prevention, policy, public service), screening of suspected cases, the provision of advice given to those people who may have symptoms or contact history. We conducted meta-analyses on the main outcomes of the studies. Results: A total of 2,041 articles were identified after removing duplicates. After reading the full texts, we finally included nine studies. People were most concerned about symptoms (64.2%), epidemic situation and public problems (14.5%), and psychological problems (10.3%) during COVID-19 epidemic. During the SARS epidemic, the proportions of people asking for consultation for symptoms, prevention and therapy, and psychological problems were 35.0%, 22.0%, and 23.0%, respectively. Two studies demonstrated that telemedicine can be used to screen the suspected patients and give advice. One study emphasized the limited possibilities to follow up people calling hotlines and difficulties in identifying all suspect cases. Conclusions: Telemedicine services should focus on the issues that the public is most concerned about, such as the symptoms, prevention and treatment of the disease, and provide reasonable advice to patients with symptoms or people with epidemic history.","Gao, Yelei; Liu, Rui; Zhou, Qi; Wang, Xingmei; Huang, Liping; Shi, Qianling; Wang, Zijun; Lu, Shuya; Li, Weiguo; Ma, Yanfang; Luo, Xufei; Fukuoka, Toshio; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lee, Myeong Soo; Luo, Zhengxiu; Liu, Enmei; Chen, Yaolong; Shu, Chang; Tian, Daiyin",Ann.

In response, many diagnostic manufacturers have developed molecular assays for SARS-CoV-2 under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) pathway. This study compared three of these assays, the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay (Fusion), the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay (Aptima), and the BioFire Defense COVID-19 test (BioFire), to determine analytical and clinical performance as well as workflow. All three assays showed similar limits of detection (LODs) using inactivated virus, with 100% detection, ranging from 500 to 1,000 genome equivalents/ml, whereas use of a quantified RNA transcript standard showed the same trend but had values ranging from 62.5 to 125 copies/ml, confirming variability in absolute quantification of reference standards. The clinical correlation found that the Fusion and BioFire assays had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 98.7%, followed by the Aptima assay at 94.7%, compared to the consensus result. All three assays exhibited 100% negative percent agreement (NPA). Analysis of discordant results revealed that all four samples missed by the Aptima assay had cycle threshold (Ct ) values of >37 by the Fusion assay. In conclusion, while all three assays showed similar relative LODs, we showed differences in absolute LODs depending on which standard was employed. In addition, the Fusion and BioFire assays showed better clinical performance, while the Aptima assay showed a modest decrease in overall PPA. These findings should be kept in mind when making platform testing decisions.","Smith, Elizabeth; Zhen, Wei; Manji, Ryhana; Schron, Deborah; Duong, Scott; Berry, Gregory J",J. clin. microbiol,,583
498900,Prescribing stigma in mental disorders: A comparative study of Portuguese psychiatrists and general practitioners,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the absence of robust preventive or curative strategies, the implementation of social distancing has been a key component of limiting the spread of the virus. METHODS: Daily estimates of R(t) were calculated and compared with measures of social distancing made publicly available by Unacast. Daily generated variables representing an overall grade for distancing, changes in distances traveled, encounters between individuals, and daily visitation, were modeled as predictors of average R value for the following week, using linear regression techniques for 8 counties surrounding the city of Syracuse, New York. Supplementary analysis examined differences between counties. RESULTS: A total of 225 observations were available across the 8 counties, with 166 meeting the mean R(t) < 3 outlier criterion for the regression models. Measurements for distance (ß = 1.002, P = .012), visitation (ß = .887, P = .017), and encounters (ß = 1.070, P = .001) were each predictors of R(t) for the following week. Mean R(t) drops when overall distancing grades move from D+ to C-. These trends were significant (P < .001 for each). CONCLUSIONS: Social distancing, when assessed by free and publicly available measures such as those shared by Unacast, has an impact on viral transmission rates. The scorecard may also be useful for public messaging about social distance, in hospital planning, and in the interpretation of epidemiological models.","Morley, Christopher P; Anderson, Kathryn B; Shaw, Jana; Stewart, Telisa; Thomas, Stephen J; Wang, Dongliang",J Public Health Manag Pract,,583

Based on the literature available at the moment, it can be assumed that the clinical course of COVID-19 disease may be complicated by pregnancy which could be associated with a higher mortality rate. It may also be assumed at the moment that transmission from mother to child in utero is unlikely.

In our body there are subcutaneous (sWAT), visceral (vWAT) and bone marrow (bWAT) fat depots. Obesity affects the size, function and inflammatory state of WATs. In particular, obesity may affect the activity of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) present in WAT. MSCs are a heterogeneous population containing stromal cells, progenitor cells, fibroblasts and stem cells that are able to differentiate among adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteocytes and other mesodermal derivatives.In the first study of this kind, we performed a comparison of the effects of obesity on MSCs obtained from sWAT, vWAT and bWAT. Our study showed that obesity affects mainly the biological functions of MSCs obtained from bone marrow and vWAT by decreasing the proliferation rate, reducing the percentage of cells in S phase and triggering senescence. The onset of senescence was confirmed by expression of genes belonging to RB and P53 pathways.Our study revealed that the negative consequences of obesity on body physiology may also be related to impairment in the functions of the stromal compartment present in the several adipose tissues.

(Special edition for COVID-19.),2020,"The paper discusses multivariate self- and cross-exciting processes. We define a class of multivariate point processes via their corresponding stochastic intensity processes that are driven by stochastic jumps. Essentially, there is a jump in an intensity process whenever the corresponding point process records an event. An attribute of our modelling class is that not only a jump is recorded at each instance, but also its magnitude. This allows large jumps to influence the intensity to a larger degree than smaller jumps. We give conditions which guarantee that the process is stable, in the sense that it does not explode, and provide a detailed discussion on when the subclass of linear models is stable. Finally, we fit our model to financial time series data from the S\&P 500 and Nikkei 225 indices respectively. We conclude that a nonlinear variant from our modelling class fits the data best. This supports the observation that in times of crises (high intensity) jumps tend to arrive in clusters, whereas there are typically longer times between jumps when the markets are calmer. We moreover observe more variability in jump sizes when the intensity is high, than when it is low.","Eyjolfsson, Heidar; Tjostheim, Dag",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10176v1.pdf,583
502657,The year of the patientThe Urgent Need to Address Violence Against Health Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The essays in this special issue of HEC Forum provide reflections that make explicit the implicit anthropology that our current pandemic has brought but which in the medical ethics literature around COVID-19 has to a great extent ignored. Three of the essays are clearly ""journalistic"" as a literary genre: one by a hospital chaplain, one by a medical student in her pre-clinical years, and one by a fourth-year medical student who reports her experience as she completed her undergraduate clerkships and applied for positions in graduate medical education. Other essays explore the pandemic from historical, sociological, and economic perspectives, particularly how triage policies have been found to be largely blind to structural healthcare disparities, while simultaneously unable to appropriately address those disparities. Central issues that need to be addressed in triage are not just whether a utilitarian response is the most just response, but what exactly is the greatest good for the greatest number? Together, the essays in this special issue of HEC Forum create a call for a more anthropological approach to understanding health and healthcare. The narrow approach of viewing health as resulting primarily from healthcare will continue to hinder advances and perpetuate disparities. Health outcomes result from a complex interaction of various social, economic, cultural, historical, and political factors. Advancing healthcare requires contextualizing the health of populations amongst these factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has made us keenly aware of how interdependent our health as a society can be.","Childs, Brian H; Vearrier, Laura",HEC Forum,,583

503648,A critique of digital mental health via assessing the psychodigitalisation of the COVID-19 crisis,2021,"PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department (ED) imaging. METHODS: This retrospective study included all ED visits at a four-hospital academic health system in two matched 5-week periods. Demographic information, COVID-19 status, and disposition were reviewed. Type of imaging, acquisition time, and radiology reports were analyzed. Significance level was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: A 43.2% decrease in ED visits and 12% reduction in overall ED imaging occurred during the pandemic period. Mean age was unchanged, but a shift in gender and racial characteristics was observed (p < 0.001). In the pandemic period, COVID-19 ED patients were older (61.8 ± 16.9 years, p < 0.001) and more likely to be Black (64.2%; p < 0.001) than non-COVID-19 patients. Imaging per ED encounter increased to 2.4 ± 2.8 exams from 1.7 ± 1.1 (p < 0.001). Radiography increased (57.2% vs. 52.4%) as a fraction of total ED imaging, while computed tomography (23.4% vs. 27.2%) and ultrasound (8.5% vs. 9.6%) decreased (pre-pandemic vs. pandemic). COVID-19 ED patients underwent CT and US at a lower rate (11.5% and 5.4%) than non-COVID-19 patients (25.4% and 9.1%). The proportion of imaging study reports concluding ""no disease"" or ""no acute disease"" decreased from 56.7 to 40.6% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant reduction in ED visits, a shift in patient demographics, and a significant decrease in imaging volume. Additional impact included a significant increase in the proportion of positive imaging studies.","Sharperson, Camara; Hanna, Tarek N; Herr, Keith D; Zygmont, Matthew E; Gerard, Roger L; Johnson, Jamlik-Omari",Emerg. radiol,,583

In order to assist medical personnel to achieve an efficient and fast diagnosis of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia, this paper proposes an assisted diagnosis algorithm based on ensemble deep learning. The method combines the Stacked Generalization ensemble learning with the VGG16 deep learning to form a cascade classifier, and the information constituting the cascade classifier comes from multiple subsets of the training set, each of which is used to collect deviant information about the generalization behavior of the data set, such that this deviant information fills the cascade classifier. The algorithm was experimentally validated for classifying patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia, patients with common pneumonia (CP), and normal controls, and the algorithm achieved a prediction accuracy of 93.57%, sensitivity of 94.21%, specificity of 93.93%, precision of 89.40%, and F1-score of 91.74% for the three categories. The results show that the method proposed in this paper has good classification performance and can significantly improve the performance of deep neural networks for multicategory prediction tasks.","Li, Xiaoshuo; Tan, Wenjun; Liu, Pan; Zhou, Qinghua; Yang, Jinzhu",J Healthc Eng,,583

506896,Global Perspectives on Improving Chronic Disease Prevention and Management in Diverse Settings,2021,"BACKGROUND: When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, surgical services had to design and implement a new system to safely manage patients and prevent workforce exposure. METHODS: A team of clinicians and educators rapidly reengineered the surgical care process. An online learning management system (LMS) and authoring tool that supported iterative remote asynchronous communication was used to build a learning module employed to train an interprofessional team to the new care process. RESULTS: Care process redesign was accomplished in a concentrated effort involving clinicians and educators. Patient flow and the role of each team member at every phase of care was presented in the LMS. The LMS was refined by input from team members provided through the authoring tool directly to the educator on the screens where the edit was applicable. The LMS was deployed after four days to more than 100 surgical team members who managed their first COVID-19 patient two days later. The number of COVID-19 patients managed was limited, but there were no untoward patient events and no staff exposure. CONCLUSION: Care process reengineering and deployment efforts are accelerated by early involvement of educators and use of an LMS with an authoring tool that supports rapid module build and refinement in a socially distant workplace. The LMS enables access on any online platform at a time convenient to team members who can then learn at their own pace. This reengineering and LMS development approach can be generally applied to speed many care process modification and improvement efforts.","Stickney, Isaac; Schoenbrod, Tanja; Cushing, Haley; Grosvenor, Julie; Cushing, Brad",Jt.

This is by nature a stochastic problem, since e.g., random perturbation in parameters can cause instability of estimation and prediction. This leaves us with a plenty of possible statistical regularizations, thus generating a plethora of sub-problems. We can mention as examples stability and sensitivity of peak estimation, starting point of exponential growth curve, or estimation of parameters of SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model. Moreover, each parameter has its specific sensitivity, and naturally, the most sensitive parameter deserves a special attention. E.g., in SIR model, parameter β is more sensitive than parameter γ. In a simple exponential epidemic growth model, parameter b is more sensitive than the parameter a. We also discuss on statistical quality of COVID-19 incidence prediction, where we justify an exponential curve considering the microbial growth in ideal conditions for epidemic. The empirical data from Iowa State, USA, Hubei Province in China, New York State, USA, and Chile justifies an exponential growth curve for initiation of epidemics outbreaks.","Stehlík, M.; Kiseľák, J.; Dinamarca, M.

507271,Assessing the psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreak and its related factors on Lebanese individuals with physical disabilities,2021,"Despite claims from prominent scientists that SARS-CoV-2 indubitably emerged naturally, the etiology of this novel coronavirus remains a pressing and open question: Without knowing the true nature of a disease, it is impossible for clinicians to appropriately shape their care, for policy-makers to correctly gauge the nature and extent of the threat, and for the public to appropriately modify their behavior. Unless the intermediate host necessary for completing a natural zoonotic jump is identified, the dual-use gain-of-function research practice of viral serial passage should be considered a viable route by which the novel coronavirus arose. The practice of serial passage mimics a natural zoonotic jump, and offers explanations for SARS-CoV-2's distinctive spike-protein region and its unexpectedly high affinity for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2), as well as the notable polybasic furin cleavage site within it. Additional molecular clues raise further questions, all of which warrant full investigation into the novel coronavirus's origins and a re-examination of the risks and rewards of dual-use gain-of-function research.","Sirotkin, Karl; Sirotkin, Dan",Bioessays,,583

Vitamin D deficiency has been reported in several chronic conditions associated with increased inflammation and dysregulation of the immune system. Vitamin D in modulates immune function too. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed by most immune cells, including B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells and the signalling of vitamin D and VDR together has an anti-inflammatory effect. Some studies have reported that vitamin D treatment could be useful for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 because vitamin D plays an important role as a modulator of immunocompetence. Over the last few months, some studies have hypothesized the possible beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation in patients with COVID-19 in order to improve the immune balance and prevent the hyperinflammatory cytokine storm. Some preliminary studies have already shown promising results with vitamin D supplementation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Vitamin D should be administered daily until adequate levels are achieved due to vitamin D behaves as a negative acute phase reactant (APR). Despite the lack of evidence on specific doses of vitamin D to treat COVID-19 in older adults, authors consider it is necessary to standardize the use in clinical practice.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS) has recently become a method of choice for routine identification of pathogens in clinical settings and has largely replaced biochemical assays. Identification relies on well-curated databases such as SARAMIS. Extensive use of SARAMIS to generate consensus mass spectra, in conjunction with statistical analysis, such as partial least square-discriminant analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis, is useful in subtyping bacteria. While MALDI-ToF MS has been extensively used for pathogen detection, its application in bacterial subtyping has been limited.

This study aimed to determine whether the Radiological Scale for Evaluating Hospital Admission (RSEHA) applied to chest X-rays of patients with COVID-19 when they present at the emergency department is related with the severity of COVID-19 in terms of the need for admission to the hospital, the need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and/or mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 292 patients with COVID-19 who presented at the emergency department between March 16, 2020 and April 30, 2020. To standardize the radiologic patterns, we used the RSEHA, categorizing the radiologic pattern as mild, moderate, or severe. We analyzed the relationship between radiologic severity according to the RSEHA with the need for admission to the hospital, admission to the ICU, and mortality. RESULTS: Hospital admission was necessary in 91.4% of the patients. The RSEHA was significantly associated with the need for hospital admission (p=0.03) and with the need for ICU admission (p<0.001). A total of 51 (17.5%) patients died; of these, 57% had the severe pattern on the RSEHA. When we analyzed mortality by grouping patients according to their results on the RSEHA and their age range, the percentage of patients who died increased after age 70 years in patients classified as moderate or severe on the RSEHA. CONCLUSIONS: Chest X-rays in patients with COVID-19 obtained in the emergency department are useful for determining the prognosis in terms of admission to the hospital, admission to the ICU, and mortality; radiologic patterns categorized as severe on the RSEHA are associated with greater mortality and admission to the ICU.","Adarve Castro, A; Díaz Antonio, T; Cuartero Martínez, E; García Gallardo, M M; Bermá Gascón, M L; Domínguez Pinos, D",Radiologia,,583

Current studies have reported that PDENs could modulate gene expression in a cross-kingdom fashion. Therefore, PDENs could be a potential future functional food ingredient as their cross-kingdom communication abilities were reported to exert multiple health benefits. Macrophage and other cells have been reported to absorb PDENs in a manner regulated by the membrane lipid and protein profile and the intactness of the PDENs lipid bilayer. PDENs could be extracted from plant materials by various techniques such as ultracentrifugation, immunoaffinity, size-based isolation, and precipitation, though each method has its pros and cons. PDENs mainly contain lipid, protein, and genetic materials, mainly micro RNAs, which could exert multiple health benefits and functionalities when consumed in sufficient amounts. However, most studies on the health functionalities of PDENs were conducted through in-vitro and in-vivo studies, and its potency to be used as a functional ingredient remains a question as PDENs are sensitive to storage and processing condition and requires costly extraction method. This concise review features various exosome extraction methods, contents of PDENs and their roles, the health functionalities of PDENs, and its potency as a functional food ingredient.","Suharta, Sigit; Barlian, Anggraini; Hidajah, Atik Choirul; Notobroto, Hari Basuki; Ana, Ika Dewi; Indariani, Susi; Wungu, Triati Dewi Kencana; Wijaya, Christofora Hanny",J. food sci,,583

While the size of this stimulus is unprecedented, Draghi probably has a short window of time in which to begin implementing reforms and to improve relations between Italy and the EU before national consensus frays and yet another government takes power. © 2021 The International Institute for Strategic Studies.","Anonymous,",Strategic Comments,,583

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to fight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another, strongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In this paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19 pandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are helping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread, enabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and conferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the pandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss the challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and misinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication technologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of industries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at risk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the pandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.","Saeed, Nasir; Bader, Ahmed; Al-Naffouri, Tareq Y.; Alouini, Mohamed-Slim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06637v2.pdf,583

METHODS: In this Institution Review Board approved study, we retrospectively evaluated COVID-19 patients treated in our tertiary center from March to November 2020 who underwent an unenhanced chest CT scan within three weeks from hospitalization.We recorded the mean Hounsfield Unit (Hu) value of the right paravertebral muscle at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra, the hospitalization unit (ICU and COVID-19 wards), clinical symptoms, Barthel Index, and laboratory findings.Logistic regression analysis was applied to assess if muscle loss (Hu<30) is a predictor of ICU admission and outcome.Fisher's exact and Student's tests were applied to evaluate if differences between patients with and without muscle loss occurred (p<0.05). RESULTS: One-hundred-fifty patients matched the inclusion criteria (46 females; mean age±SD 61.3±15 years-old), 36 treated in ICU. Patients in ICU showed significantly lower Hu values (29±24 vs 39.4±12, p = 0.001). Muscle loss was a predictor of ICU admission (p = 0.004).Patients with muscle loss were significantly older (73.4±10 vs 56.4±14 years), had lower Barthel Index scores (54.4±33 vs 85.1±26), red blood-cell count (3.9±1 vs 4.6±1×1012L-1), and Hb levels (11.5±2 vs 13.2±2g/l) as well as higher white blood-cell count (9.4±7 vs 7.2±4×109L-1), C-reactive protein (71.5±71 vs 44±48U/L), and lactate dehydrogenase levels (335±163 vs 265.8±116U/L) (p<0.05, each).

In particular, we consider the forecast of the number of new daily confirmed cases. A forecast procedure combining a log-polynomial model together with a first-order integer-valued autoregressive model is proposed. An out-of-sample comparison with forecasts from an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is considered. This comparison indicates that our procedure outperforms the ARIMA model. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the ARIMA is always greater than that of the our procedure and generally more than twice as high as the our procedure RMSE. We have also conducted Diebold and Mariano (1995) tests of equal mean square error (MSE). The tests results confirm that forecasts from our procedure are significantly more accurate at all horizons. We think that the advantage of our approach comes from the fact that it explicitly takes into account the number of swabs.","Triacca, Marco; Triacca, Umberto",,,583

Youth Perceptions about the Relationship Between E-Cigarette Use and COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe public health problem around the globe. Various epidemiological, statistical, and laboratory-based studies have shown that the role of temperature and other environmental factors has important influence in the transmission of coronaviruses. Scientific research is needed to answer the questions about the spread and transmission of the infection, whether people could be avoided from being infected with COVID-19 in next summer. AIM: We aim to investigate the association of daily average temperature, daily average dew point, daily average humidity, daily average wind speed, and daily average pressure with the infection caused by this novel coronavirus in Pakistan. KEY FINDINGS: First, we check the correlation between environmental factors and daily infected cases of COVID-19; among them, temperature and dew point have positive linear relationship with daily infected cases of COVID-19. The thought-provoking findings of the present study suggested that higher temperature and dew point can contribute to a rise in COVID-19 disease in four provinces of Pakistan, possible to genome modifications and viral resistance to harsh environment. Moreover, it is also observed that humidity in Punjab and Sindh, and wind speed in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have influenced the spreading of daily infected COVID-19 cases. SIGNIFICANCE: Current study will serve as a guideline to develop understanding of environmental factors that influence COVID-19 spread, helping policymakers to prepare and handle a catastrophe resulting from this pandemic.","Fawad, Muhammad; Mubarik, Sumaira; Malik, Saima Shakil; Ren, Jingli",Life Sci,,583

The mechanisms used by viruses to cause arrest vary widely; some involve the activation of the cellular pathways that induce arrest in response to DNA damage, while others use completely novel means. The analysis of virus-mediated arrest has not been proven easy, and in most cases the consequences of arrest for the virus life cycle are not well defined. However, a number of effects of arrest are being investigated and it will be interesting to see to what extent perturbation of the G2/M transition is involved in viral infections.","Davy, Clare; Doorbar, John",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17675127/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268220700387X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268220700387X,583

In Ethiopia, more than 90,490 and 1,300 confirmed cases and deaths were reported by the Federal Ministry of Health at the time of writing up this project. As health care providers are frontline workers managing the COVID-19 pandemic, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the pooled level of knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 among health professionals in Ethiopia. METHODS: PubMed, Google Scholar, Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and African Journal of Online (AJOL) were searched. The data were extracted using Microsoft Excel and analyzed using STATA version 14. Publication bias was checked by funnel plot and more objectively through Egger’s regression test, with P < 0.05 considered to indicate potential publication bias. The heterogeneity of studies was checked using I(2) statistics. Pooled analysis was conducted using a weighted inverse variance random-effects model. Subgroup analysis was done related to geographic region and time. A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was also employed. RESULT: A total of 11 studies with 3,843 study participants for knowledge, eight studies with 2,842 study participants for attitude and 10 studies with 3, 435 study participants for practice were used to estimate the pooled level of good knowledge, positive attitude and poor practice among health professionals. The overall estimated good level of knowledge, positive attitude and poor practice towards COVID-19 was found to be 79.4% (95% CI: 73.5%-85.2%; I2 = 96%), 73.7% (95%CI: 63.09%-84.4%; I2 = 98.3%) and 40.3% (95%CI: 31.1%-49.6%; I2 = 97.1%) respectively. CONCLUSION: Study findings showed that there were significant gaps in COVID-19 related knowledge, attitude and practice with respect to World Health Organization recommendations on COVID-19 management and personal protection practices. This study therefore recommends that institutions provide with immediate effect accurate and up-to-date information on COVID-19 and training that encourages improved knowledge, attitude and practice to mitigate this pandemic.","Lake, Eyasu Alem; Demissie, Birhanu Wondimeneh; Gebeyehu, Natneal Atnafu; Wassie, Addisu Yeshambel; Gelaw, Kelemu Abebe; Azeze, Gedion Asnake",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606744/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247204,583

We wish to emphasize the fact that commonly GBS occurs as a result of a post‐infectious process but in a few cases where the symptoms of COVID‐19 and GBS occur concurrently, corresponding to the viremic phase, separate pathogenesis needs to be thought of. This para‐infectious nature is exemplified by the presence of virus in the cerebrospinal fluid of one of our patients.

Yet, selection pressures driving DENV microevolution within human hosts (‘intrahost’) remain unknown. We employed a whole-genome segmented amplification approach coupled with deep sequencing to profile DENV-3 intrahost diversity in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and plasma samples from 77 dengue patients. DENV-3 intrahost diversity appears to be driven by immune pressures as well as replicative success in PBMCs and potentially other replication sites. Hotspots for intrahost variation were detected in 59–78% of patients in the viral Envelope and pre-Membrane/Membrane proteins, which together form the virion surface. Dominant variants at the hotspots arose via convergent microevolution, appear to be immune-escape variants, and were evolutionarily constrained at the macro-level due to viral replication defects. Dengue is thus an example of an acute infection in which selection pressures within infected individuals drive rapid intrahost virus microevolution.","Parameswaran, Poornima; Wang, Chunling; Trivedi, Surbhi Bharat; Eswarappa, Meghana; Montoya, Magelda; Balmaseda, Angel; Harris, Eva",Cell Host & Microbe,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312817303359; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2017.08.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312817303359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28910637/; http://www.cell.com/article/S1931312817303359/pdf,583

Since the first COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved with a few genetic variants associated with higher infectivity. We aimed to identify polymorphic loci in SARS-CoV-2 that can be used to define and monitor the viral epidemiology and population genetics in different geographical regions. Between December 2019 and September 2020, we sampled 5,959 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. More than 80% of the genomes sampled in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and South America were reportedly isolated from clinical infections in older patients, [≥] 20 years. We used the first indexed genome (NC_045512.2) as a reference and constructed multilocus genotypes (MLGs) for each sampled genome based on amino acids detected at 74 polymorphic loci located in ORF1ab, ORF3a, ORF8, matrix (M), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) genes. Eight of the 74 loci were informative in estimating the risk of carrying infections with mutant alleles among different age groups, gender and geographical regions. Four mutant alleles - ORF1ab L4715, S G614, and N K203 and R204 reached 90% prevalence globally, coinciding with peaks in transmission but not COVID-19 severity, from March to August 2020. During this period, the MLG genetic diversity was moderate in Asia, Oceania and North America; in contrast to Africa, Europe and South America, where lower genetic diversity and absence of linkage disequilibrium indicated clonal SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Despite close relatedness to Asian MLGs, MLGs in the global population were genetically differentiated by geographic region, suggesting structure in SARS-CoV-2 populations. Our findings demonstrate the utility of the 74 loci as a genetic tool to study and monitor SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and evolution, which can inform future control interventions.","Chan, F.; Ataide, R.; Richards, J.

During the second week of viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur and carries high mortality. Unlike most common respiratory viruses, children seem to be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and generally develop mild disease with low mortality. However, clusters of severe shock associated with high levels of cardiac biomarkers and unusual vasoplegia requiring inotropes, vasopressors and volume loading have recently been described. Both the clinical symptoms (i.e. high and persistent fever, gastrointestinal disorders, skin rash, conjunctival injection and dry cracked lips) and the biological signs (e.g. elevated C-reactive protein/procalcitonin and high levels of ferritinaemia) mimicked Kawasaki disease. In most cases, intravenous immunoglobin therapy improved cardiac function and led to full recovery within a few days. Adjunctive steroid therapy and sometimes biotherapy (e.g. anti-interleukin 1Ra and anti-interleukin 6 monoclonal antibodies) were often necessary. Although almost all children fully recovered within a week, some of them later developed coronary artery dilation or aneurysm. Thus, a new “multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children” related to SARS-CoV-2 has recently been described.

The pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) is efficiently formed in multiple human cell types incubated with GS-5734 in vitro, and the NTP acts as an alternate substrate and RNA-chain terminator in primer-extension assays utilizing a surrogate respiratory syncytial virus RNA polymerase. Intravenous administration of GS-5734 to nonhuman primates resulted in persistent NTP levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (half-life = 14 h) and distribution to sanctuary sites for viral replication including testes, eye, and brain. In a rhesus monkey model of EVD, once daily intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg GS-5734 for 12 days resulted in profound suppression of EBOV replication and protected 100% of EBOV-infected animals against lethal disease, ameliorating clinical disease signs and pathophysiological markers, even when treatments were initiated three days after virus exposure when systemic viral RNA was detected in two of six treated animals. These results provide the first substantive, post-exposure protection by a small-molecule antiviral compound against EBOV in nonhuman primates. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of GS-5734 in vitro against other pathogenic RNA viruses – including filoviruses, arenaviruses, and coronaviruses – suggests the potential for expanded indications. GS-5734 is amenable to large-scale manufacturing, and clinical studies investigating the drug safety and pharmacokinetics are ongoing.","Warren, Travis K.; Jordan, Robert; Lo, Michael K.; Ray, Adrian S.; Mackman, Richard L.; Soloveva, Veronica; Siegel, Dustin; Perron, Michel; Bannister, Roy; Hui, Hon C.; Larson, Nate; Strickley, Robert; Wells, Jay; Stuthman, Kelly S.; Van Tongeren, Sean A.; Garza, Nicole L.; Donnelly, Ginger; Shurtleff, Amy C.; Retterer, Cary J.; Gharaibeh, Dima; Zamani, Rouzbeh; Kenny, Tara; Eaton, Brett P.; Grimes, Elizabeth; Welch, Lisa S.; Gomba, Laura; Wilhelmsen, Catherine L.; Nichols, Donald K.; Nuss, Jonathan E.; Nagle, Elyse R.; Kugelman, Jeffrey R.; Palacios, Gustavo; Doerffler, Edward; Neville, Sean; Carra, Ernest; Clarke, Michael O.; Zhang, Lijun; Lew, Willard; Ross, Bruce; Wang, Queenie; Chun, Kwon; Wolfe, Lydia; Babusis, Darius; Park, Yeojin; Stray, Kirsten M.; Trancheva, Iva; Feng, Joy Y.; Baraskaus, Ona; Xu, Yili; Wong, Pamela; Braun, Molly R.; Flint, Mike; McMullan, Laura K.; Chen, Shan-Shan; Fearns, Rachel; Swaminathan, Swami; Mayers, Douglas L.; Spiropoulou, Christina F.; Lee, William A.; Nichol, Stuart T.; Cihlar, Tomas; Bavari, Sina",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26934220/; https://doi.org/10.1038/nature17180,583
597535,Visual Algorithm of VR E-Sports for Online Health Care,2021-06-29,"BACKGROUND: In this case report, we describe the trajectory of recovery of a young, healthy patient diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. The purpose of this case report is to highlight the potential role of intensive care unit recovery or follow-up clinics for patients surviving acute hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 27-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history of asthma transferred from a community hospital to our medical intensive care unit for acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to bilateral pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation (ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fraction of inspired oxygen, 180). On day 2 of her intensive care unit admission, reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction confirmed coronavirus disease 2019. Her clinical status gradually improved, and she was extubated on intensive care unit day 5. She had a negative test result for coronavirus disease 2019 twice with repeated reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction before being discharged to home after 10 days in the intensive care unit. Two weeks after intensive care unit discharge, the patient returned to our outpatient intensive care unit recovery clinic. At follow-up, the patient endorsed significant fatigue and exhaustion with difficulty walking, minor issues with sleep disruption, and periods of memory loss. She scored 10/12 on the short performance physical battery, indicating good physical function. She did not have signs of anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder through self-report questionnaires. Clinically, she was considered at low risk of developing post–intensive care syndrome, but she required follow-up services to assist in navigating the healthcare system, addressing remaining symptoms, and promoting return to her pre–coronavirus disease 2019 societal role. CONCLUSION: We present this case report to suggest that patients surviving coronavirus disease 2019 with subsequent development of acute respiratory distress syndrome will require more intense intensive care unit recovery follow-up. Patients with a higher degree of acute illness who also have pre-existing comorbidities and those of older age who survive mechanical ventilation for coronavirus disease 2019 will require substantial post–intensive care unit care to mitigate and treat post–intensive care syndrome, promote reintegration into the community, and improve quality of life.","Mayer, Kirby P.; Sturgill, Jamie L.; Kalema, Anna G.; Soper, Melissa K.; Seif, Sherif M.; Cassity, Evan P.; Hatton Kolpek, Jimmi; Dupont-Versteegden, Esther E.; Montgomery-Yates, Ashley A.; Morris, Peter E.",J Med Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-020-02481-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912329/,583

Crucial interference with their everyday lives likely increased psychological distress while accessibility of conventional mental health care was limited. Ongoing online trials offer a unique opportunity to analyse mental health status and help‐seeking behaviour of adolescents during the pandemic. The ProHEAD‐online trial aims at improving help‐seeking behaviour of children and adolescents with significant psychological impairment. From January to May 2020, 1,042 students had access to the ProHEAD‐online platform providing information on mental illness, monitoring, peer support and professional counselling. In the week from 11 March, when schools were closed in Germany, a drastic (more than 2 standard deviations) but time‐limited increase in utilization of the ProHEAD‐online services became apparent. This may indicate a worsened mental health status and an increased help seeking via digital services during the lockdown. Although this finding is purely observational, it speaks to the importance of evidence‐based online service in the field of mental health within the current crisis and beyond.","Kaess, Michael; Moessner, Markus; Koenig, Julian; Lustig, Sophia; Bonnet, Sabrina; Becker, Katja; Eschenbeck, Heike; Rummel‐Kluge, Christine; Thomasius, Rainer; Bauer, Stephanie",J Child Psychol Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32924134/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13317,583

Los ictus cardioembólicos habitualmente son más graves y tienen altas tasas de recurrencias y discapacidad permanente en comparación con los ictus de otras etiologías. En consecuencia, la reducción del riesgo de ictus mediante una adecuada anticoagulación es uno de los principales objetivos en el tratamiento de los pacientes con fibrilación auricular. Los antagonistas de la vitamina K han sido ampliamente superados por los anticoagulantes orales de acción directa, ya que tanto los resultados de los ensayos clínicos como los de los estudios de práctica clínica y, últimamente, estudios poblacionales han demostrado que los anticoagulantes orales de acción directa tienen mayores eficacia (menos ictus y muerte) y seguridad (menos hemorragias intracraneales) que los antagonistas de la vitamina K. Además, durante la pandemia de COVID-19, el empleo preferente de anticoagulantes orales de acción directa frente a los antagonistas de la vitamina K constituye una estrategia clave para garantizar una calidad óptima de la anticoagulación y una mejor protección del paciente contra el SARS-CoV-2, al no precisarse control de la razón internacional normalizada. Atrial fibrillation is associated with up to a five-fold increase in the risk of stroke. Cardioembolic stroke is usually more severe than other types of stroke and has higher rates of recurrence and permanent disability. Consequently, reducing the risk of stroke through adequate anticoagulation is one of the main goals of treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation. Vitamin K antagonists have been largely superseded by direct oral anticoagulants because the results of clinical trials, real-life studies and, recently, population studies have all demonstrated that direct oral anticoagulants are more effective (i.e. the risk of stroke and death is lower) and safer (i.e. the risk of intracranial hemorrhage is lower) than vitamin K antagonists. In addition, COVID-19 pandemic, the preferential use of direct oral anticoagulants instead of vitamin K antagonists has been a key strategy for ensuring that the quality of anticoagulation is optimal and that patients are better protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as no international normalized ratio control is required.","Vallejo, Jaime Masjuan; Fillat, Ángel Cequier; García, Víctor Expósito; Fernández, Carmen Suárez; Rabadán, Inmaculada Roldán; Freixa-Pamias, Román; Pérez Cabeza, Alejandro Isidoro; Muñoz, Alfonso Valle; Lozano, Ignacio Fernández",Revista Española de Cardiología Suplementos,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1131358721000029; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1131-3587(21)00002-9; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1131358721000029,583
599923,Online education at the medical School of Tongji University during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study,2021-09-28,"Summary Background and Aims In the newly emerged Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disaster, little is known about the nutritional risks for critically ill patients. It is also unknown whether the modified Nutrition Risk in the Critically ill (mNUTRIC) score is applicable for nutritional risk assessment in intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 patients. We set out to investigate the applicability of the mNUTRIC score for assessing nutritional risks and predicting outcomes for these critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods This retrospective observational study was conducted in three ICUs which had been specially established and equipped for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. The study population was critically ill COVID-19 patients who had been admitted to these ICUs between January 28 and February 21, 2020. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patients of <18 years; 2) patients who were pregnant; 3) length of ICU stay of <24 hours; 4) insufficient medical information available. Patients’ characteristics and clinical information were obtained from electronic medical and nursing records. The nutritional risk for each patient was assessed at their ICU admission using the mNUTRIC score. A score of ≥5 indicated high nutritional risk. Mortality was calculated according to patients’ outcomes following 28 days of hospitalization in ICU. Results A total of 136 critically ill COVID-19 patients with a median age of 69 years (IQR: 57-77), 86 (63%) males and 50 (37%) females, were included in the study. Based on the mNUTRIC score at ICU admission, a high nutritional risk (≥5 points) was observed in 61% of the critically ill COVID-19 patients, while a low nutritional risk (<5 points) was observed in 39%. The mortality of ICU 28-day was significantly higher in the high nutritional risk group than in the low nutritional risk group (87% vs 49%, P <0.001). Patients in the high nutritional risk group exhibited significantly higher incidences of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute myocardial injury, secondary infection, shock and use of vasopressors. Additionally, use of a multivariate Cox analysis showed that patients with high nutritional risk had a higher probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk (adjusted HR =2.01, 95% CI: 1.22-3.32, P =0.006). Conclusions A large proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients had a high nutritional risk, as revealed by their mNUTRIC score. Patients with high nutritional risk at ICU admission exhibited significantly higher mortality of ICU 28-day, as well as twice the probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk. Therefore, the mNUTRIC score may be an appropriate tool for nutritional risk assessment and prognosis prediction for critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Ping; He, Zhigang; Yu, Gang; Peng, Dan; Feng, Yikuan; Ling, Jianmin; Wang, Ye; Li, Shusheng; Bian, Yi",Clin Nutr,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261561420302880; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2020.05.051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32527576/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561420302880?v=s5,583

U.S. studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection have examined infections in nonrandom samples (1) or seroprevalence in specific populations* (2), which are limited in their generalizability and cannot be used to accurately calculate infection-fatality rates. During April 25-29, 2020, Indiana conducted statewide random sample testing of persons aged ≥12 years to assess prevalence of active infection and presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; additional nonrandom sampling was conducted in racial and ethnic minority communities to better understand the impact of the virus in certain racial and ethnic minority populations. Estimates were adjusted for nonresponse to reflect state demographics using an iterative proportional fitting method. Among 3,658 noninstitutionalized participants in the random sample survey, the estimated statewide point prevalence of active SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 1.74% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-2.54); 44.2% of these persons reported no symptoms during the 2 weeks before testing. The prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) seropositivity, indicating past infection, was 1.09% (95% CI = 0.76-1.45). The overall prevalence of current and previous infections of SARS-CoV-2 in Indiana was 2.79% (95% CI = 2.02-3.70). In the random sample, higher overall prevalences were observed among Hispanics and those who reported having a household contact who had previously been told by a health care provider that they had COVID-19. By late April, an estimated 187,802 Indiana residents were currently or previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 (9.6 times higher than the number of confirmed cases [17,792]) (3), and 1,099 residents died (infection-fatality ratio = 0.58%). The number of reported cases represents only a fraction of the estimated total number of infections. Given the large number of persons who remain susceptible in Indiana, adherence to evidence-based public health mitigation and containment measures (e.g., social distancing, consistent and correct use of face coverings, and hand hygiene) is needed to reduce surge in hospitalizations and prevent morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.","Menachemi, Nir; Yiannoutsos, Constantin T.; Dixon, Brian E.; Duszynski, Thomas J.; Fadel, William F.; Wools-Kaloustian, Kara K.; Unruh Needleman, Nadia; Box, Kristina; Caine, Virginia; Norwood, Connor; Weaver, Lindsay; Halverson, Paul K.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32701938/; https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6929e1,583

In such situation, predicting as accurately as possible the future dynamics of the virus is a challenging problem for scientists and decision-makers. In this paper, four phenomenological epidemic models as well as Suspected-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model are investigated for predicting the cumulative number of infected cases in Saudi Arabia in addition to the probable end-date of the outbreak. The prediction problem is formulated as an optimization framework and solved using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The Generalized Richards Model (GRM) has been found to be the best one in achieving two objectives: first, fitting the collected data (covering 223 days between March 2(nd) and October 10, 2020) with the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE = 3.2889%), the highest coefficient of determination (R(2) = 0.9953) and the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE = 8827); and second, predicting a probable end date found to be around the end of December 2020 with a projected number of 378,299 at the end of the outbreak.

Objectives The objective of this study was to compare the test characteristics of point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) with chest x-ray (CXR) at radiographically detecting COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods This was a single-center, prospective, observational study at an urban university hospital with >105,000 patient visits annually. Patients >18 years old, who presented to the emergency department with predefined signs and symptoms of COVID-19, were eligible for enrollment. Each patient received a LUS using a portable, handheld ultrasound followed by a single view, portable anteroposterior CXR. Patients with an abnormal LUS or CXR underwent a non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (NCCT). The primary outcome was the radiographic diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia on NCCT. Results 110 patients underwent LUS, CXR, and NCCT. 99 LUS and 73 CXRs were interpreted as positive. 81 NCCT were interpreted as positive providing a prevalence of COVID-19 pneumonia of 75% (95% CI 66-83.2) in our study population. LUS sensitivity was 97.6% (95% CI 91.6-99.7) vs 69.9% (95% CI 58.8-79.5) for CXR. LUS specificity was 33.3% (95% CI 16.5-54) vs 44.4% (95% CI 25.5-64.7) for CXR. LUS positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 81.8% (95% CI 72.8-88.9) and 81.8% (95% CI 48.2-97.7) vs. 79.5% (95% CI 68.4-88) and 32.4% (95% CI 18-49.8) for CXR.

METHODS: Sixty-two typically developing adolescents participated in the study before (Time 1: January 15 to March 13, 2020) and during (Time 2: May 15 to June 30, 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. At Time 1, each participant’s sleep pattern was assessed in the home environment using actigraphy and sleep logs for seven consecutive nights. Adolescents completed a battery of questionnaires in which they reported on their sleep schedule, duration, and quality, as well as their activities at bedtime, their daytime sleepiness, and their social/emotional behavior. The participants’ parents provided demographic information. At Time 2, each participant completed a sleep log, the same battery of questionnaires regarding sleep, and the Perceived Stress Scale. RESULTS: (1) Adolescents’ reported sleep was of longer duration and on a delayed schedule during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-pandemic. (2) A larger proportion of adolescents reported meeting or exceeding the recommended amount of sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-pandemic sleep. (3) “Social jet lag” disappeared during the COVID-19 pandemic. (4) A shorter reported sleep duration and higher level of arousal at bedtime at Time 1 were significant predictors of adolescents’ perceived stress at Time 2—during the COVID-19 pandemic. (5) A higher levels of arousal at bedtime and lower reported sleep quality at Time 2 were concurrently associated with higher levels of perceived stress among adolescents, even when we controlled for the levels of pre-pandemic emotional or behavioral issues, sleep duration, or sleep quality. CONCLUSION: Sleep duration and cognitive-emotional arousal, which are both modifiable behaviors, were associated with adolescents’ perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. These behaviors could be useful targets for preventive interventions aiming to reduce adolescents’ stress in the face of stressogenic situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gruber, Reut; Gauthier-Gagne, Gabrielle; Voutou, Denise; Somerville, Gail; Saha, Sujata; Boursier, Johanne",Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-021-00399-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34461960/,583

While the long fiber binds to the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor, the function of the short fiber in the virus life cycle is poorly understood. Here, we show, by glycan microarray analysis and cellular studies, that the short fiber knob (SFK) of HAdV-52 recognizes long chains of α-2,8-linked polysialic acid (polySia), a large posttranslational modification of selected carrier proteins, and that HAdV-52 can use polySia as a receptor on target cells. X-ray crystallography, NMR, molecular dynamics simulation, and structure-guided mutagenesis of the SFK reveal that the nonreducing, terminal sialic acid of polySia engages the protein with direct contacts, and that specificity for polySia is achieved through subtle, transient electrostatic interactions with additional sialic acid residues. In this study, we present a previously unrecognized role for polySia as a cellular receptor for a human viral pathogen. Our detailed analysis of the determinants of specificity for this interaction has general implications for protein–carbohydrate interactions, particularly concerning highly charged glycan structures, and provides interesting dimensions on the biology and evolution of members of Human mastadenovirus G.","Lenman, Annasara; Liaci, A.

The work packages making up the current research project use quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the psychological sequelae for HCWs in the context of COVID-19 in geographically adjacent healthcare areas (South and Mid-West of Ireland) across four time points (induction, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year follow-up). The quantitative arm of the project (WP 1) utilises the Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM-SR) and examines a number of key psychological factors pertinent to this model including perceptions about COVID-19 and infection more generally, coping, formal and informal support and a number of impact variables including mood, sleep quality, and perceptions of stigma. The qualitative study (WP 2) will address HCWs experiences of working during the pandemic, ascertain any additional areas of psychological functioning, environmental and workplace factors and resources that may be utilised by HCWs and that are not assessed by the quantitative study protocol, focusing particularly on those staff groups typically underrepresented in previous studies.","Fortune, Donal G.; Richards, Helen L.; Wormald, Andrew; O Connor, Kieran; McKiernan, Margaret; Najt, Pablo; O Dwyer, Amanda; O Dea, Edmond; Burke, Paul; Eustace, Joseph",HRB Open Res,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13204.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34109298/,583

Among the proresolving mediators, the essential fatty acid-derived specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPM) govern immune responses to limit disease severity. Notably, little is known about the relationship between the expression and activity of SPM pathways, circulating phagocyte function and disease severity in patients infected with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 leading to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: Herein, we investigated the link between circulating SPM concentrations and phagocyte activation status and function in patients with COVID-19 (n=39) compared with healthy (n=12) and post-COVID-19 (n=8) volunteers. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lipid mediator profiling demonstrated that plasma SPM concentrations were upregulated in patients with mild COVID-19 and are downregulated in those with severe disease. SPM concentrations were correlated with both circulating phagocyte activation status and function. Perturbations in plasma SPM concentrations and phagocyte activation were retained after the resolution of COVID-19 clinical symptoms. Treatment of patients with dexamethasone upregulated both the expression of SPM biosynthetic enzymes in circulating phagocytes and plasma concentration of these mediators. Notably, incubation of phagocytes from patients with COVID-19 with SPM rectified their phenotype and function. This included a downregulation in the expression of activation markers, a decrease in the tissue factor and inflammatory cytokine expression, and an upregulation of bacterial phagocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that downregulation of systemic SPM concentrations is linked with both increased disease severity and dysregulated phagocyte function. They also identify the upregulation of these mediators by dexamethasone as a potential host protective mechanism elicited by this drug in patients with COVID-19. Taken together, our findings elucidate a role for altered resolution mechanisms in the disruption of phagocyte responses and the propagation of systemic inflammation in COVID-19.","Koenis, Duco Steven; Beegun, Issa; Jouvene, Charlotte Camille; Aguirre, Gabriel Amador; Souza, Patricia Regina; Gonzalez-Nunez, Maria; Ly, Lucy; Pistorius, Kimberly; Kocher, Hemant M.; Ricketts, William; Thomas, Gavin; Perretti, Mauro; Alusi, Ghassan; Pfeffer, Paul; Dalli, Jesmond",Circ Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34238021/; https://doi.org/10.1161/circresaha.121.319142,583

ARDS is documented in severe cases of COVID-19. No effective pharmacological treatments for ARDS are currently available. Dysfunctional immune responses and pulmonary and systemic inflammation are characteristic features of ARDS pathogenesis. Recent advances in our understanding of the regulation of inflammation point to an important role of the vagus-nerve-mediated inflammatory reflex and neural cholinergic signaling. We examined whether pharmacological cholinergic activation using a clinically approved (for myasthenia gravis) cholinergic drug, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine alters pulmonary and systemic inflammation in mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS. Male C57Bl/6 mice received one intratracheal instillation of LPS or were sham manipulated (control). Both groups were treated with either vehicle or pyridostigmine (1.5 mg/kg twice daily, 3 mg/day) administered by oral gavage starting at 1 h post-LPS and euthanized 24 h after LPS administration. Other groups were either sham manipulated or received LPS for 3 days and were treated with vehicle or pyridostigmine and euthanized at 72 h. Pyridostigmine treatment reduced the increased total number of cells and neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in mice with ARDS at 24 and 72 h. Pyridostigmine also reduced the number of macrophages and lymphocytes at 72 h. In addition, pyridostigmine suppressed the levels of TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ in BALF and plasma at 24 and 72 h. However, this cholinergic agent did not significantly altered BALF and plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Neither LPS nor pyridostigmine affected BALF IFN-γ and IL-10 levels at 24 h post-LPS. In conclusion, treatments with the cholinergic agent pyridostigmine ameliorate pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses in mice with endotoxin-induced ARDS. Considering that pyridostigmine is a clinically approved drug, these findings are of substantial interest for implementing pyridostigmine in therapeutic strategies for ARDS.","Bricher Choque, Pamela Nithzi; Vieira, Rodolfo P.; Ulloa, Luis; Grabulosa, Caren; Irigoyen, Maria Claudia; De Angelis, Katia; Ligeiro De Oliveira, Ana Paula; Tracey, Kevin J.; Pavlov, Valentin A.; Consolim-Colombo, Fernanda Marciano",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34017249/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.624895,583

Among these, CCR5 and CXCR4 play pivotal roles in cancer metastasis and HIV-1 transmission and infection. They act as essential co-receptors for HIV and furnish a route to the cell entry. In particular, inhibition of either CCR5 or CXCR4 leads very often the virus to shift to a more virulent dual-tropic strain. Therefore, dual receptor inhibition might improve the therapeutic strategies against HIV. In this study, we aimed to discover selective CCR5, CXCR4, and dual CCR5/CXCR4 antagonists using both receptor- and ligand-based computational methods. We employed this approach to fully incorporate the interaction attributes of the binding pocket together with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energy calculations. The best hits were evaluated for their anti-HIV-1 activity against CXCR4- and CCR5-specific NL4.3 and BaL strains. Moreover, the Ca(2+) mobilization assay was used to evaluate their antagonistic activity. From the 27 tested compounds, three were identified as inhibitors: compounds 27 (CCR5), 6 (CXCR4) and 3 (dual) with IC(50) values ranging from 10.64 to 64.56 μM. The binding mode analysis suggests that the active compounds form a salt bridge with the glutamates and π-stacking interactions with the aromatic side chains binding site residues of the respective co-receptor. The presented hierarchical virtual screening approach provides essential aspects in identifying potential antagonists in terms of selectivity against a specific co-receptor. The compounds having multiple heterocyclic nitrogen atoms proved to be relatively more specific towards CXCR4 inhibition as compared to CCR5. The identified compounds serve as a starting point for further development of HIV entry inhibitors through synthesis and quantitative structure-activity relationship studies.","Mirza, Muhammad Usman; Saadabadi, Atefeh; Vanmeert, Michiel; Salo-Ahen, Outi M.H.; Abdullah, Iskandar; Claes, Sandra; De Jonghe, Steven; Schols, Dominique; Ahmad, Sarfraz; Froeyen, Matheus",Eur J Pharm Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejps.2020.105537; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928098720303250?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890663/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0928098720303250,583

612372,Pharmacists' perspectives on providing the COVID-19 vaccine in community pharmacies,2021-04-21,"BACKGROUND: Historically, indigo-yielding plant species were important cash crops from Central Asia to the southern United States and Central America. Indigo-dyed textiles were widely traded along the legendary Silk Road that linked China to Europe. Today, due to the labor-intensive nature of indigo extraction at the household level, lifestyle changes and the widespread availability of commercially produced indigo paste, traditional indigo extraction methods have declined in villages. Yet Li textile weavers on Hainan Island are internationally recognized as producers of indigo-dyed textile using warp ikat techniques. In contrast, Hainan Miao weavers produce indigo-dyed textiles using batik (wax resist) techniques. The aim of this study was to document the indigenous knowledge on indigo-yielding plant species used by both Hainan Miao and Li people on Hainan Island, China. METHOD: Ethnic uses were documented during three field surveys, through a questionnaire survey of 193 respondents, comprising 144 Hainan Miao and 49 Li traditional dyers. Mention index (QI), Availability index (AI), and Preference ranking (PR) of each indigo-yielding plant species were calculated to screen out plant resources with potential development value. RESULTS: Five indigo-yielding plant species (from four plant families and four genera) were historically used by Hainan Miao and Li dyers. However, just four species are still in use. Strobilanthes cusia was the main indigo source for Hainan Miao dyers. Li dyers also commonly use Indigofera species (I. tinctoria and I. suffruticosa) for indigo extraction. Wrightia laevis is less commonly used as a contemporary indigo source. Indigo extraction by steeping in water to which lime is added to increase the pH is sharing by the five indigo-yielding plant species. Strobilanthes cusia had the highest QI, AI and PR values in Hainan Miao villages. Indigofera tinctoria had the highest QI and AI values, but Indigofera suffruticosa was preferred by Li dyers. CONCLUSION: In the process of modernization and urbanization, some Hainan Miao and Li dyers retain the traditional indigo extraction methods. We found that Strobilanthes cusia and Indigofera tinctoria have the most potential for sustainable indigo production in the future. Furthermore, this study documents the details of extraction method from Wrightia laevis for the first time and the use of Ricinus communis seeds in that process. As one of the last places globally where Wrightia laevis is still used for indigo production, the may also be a nice market among textile collectors and museums that keeps the tradition of Wrightia laevis production and use for indigo extraction alive.","Zhang, Libin; Wang, Lu; Cunningham, Anthony B.; Shi, Yuru; Wang, Yuhua",J Ethnobiol Ethnomed,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13002-019-0314-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269961/,583
612688,Post COVID-19 lockdown: measures and practices for dental institutes,2020-10-27,"The genus Sapovirus belongs to the family Caliciviridae, and its members are common causative agents of severe acute gastroenteritis in both humans and animals. Some caliciviruses are known to use either terminal sialic acids or histo-blood group antigens as attachment factors and/or cell surface proteins, such as CD300lf, CD300ld, and junctional adhesion molecule 1 of tight junctions (TJs), as receptors. However, the roles of TJs and their proteins in sapovirus entry have not been examined. In this study, we found that porcine sapovirus (PSaV) significantly decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and increased paracellular permeability early in infection of LLC-PK cells, suggesting that PSaV dissociates TJs of cells. This led to the interaction between PSaV particles and occludin, which traveled in a complex into late endosomes via Rab5- and Rab7-dependent trafficking. Inhibition of occludin using small interfering RNA (siRNA), a specific antibody, or a dominant-negative mutant significantly blocked the entry of PSaV. Transient expression of occludin in nonpermissive Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells conferred susceptibility to PSaV, but only for a limited time. Although claudin-1, another TJ protein, neither directly interacted nor was internalized with PSaV particles, it facilitated PSaV entry and replication in the LLC-PK cells. We conclude that PSaV particles enter LLC-PK cells by binding to occludin as a coreceptor in PSaV-dissociated TJs. PSaV and occludin then form a complex that moves to late endosomes via Rab5- and Rab7-dependent trafficking. In addition, claudin-1 in the TJs opened by PSaV infection facilitates PSaV entry and infection as an entry factor. IMPORTANCE Sapoviruses (SaVs) cause severe acute gastroenteritis in humans and animals. Although they replicate in intestinal epithelial cells, which are tightly sealed by apical-junctional complexes, such as tight junctions (TJs), the mechanisms by which SaVs hijack TJs and their proteins for successful entry and infection remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that porcine SaVs (PSaVs) induce early dissociation of TJs, allowing them to bind to the TJ protein occludin as a functional coreceptor. PSaVs then travel in a complex with occludin into late endosomes through Rab5- and Rab7-dependent trafficking. Claudin-1, another TJ protein, does not directly interact with PSaV but facilitates the entry of PSaV into cells as an entry factor. This work contributes to our understanding of the entry of SaV and other caliciviruses into cells and may aid in the development of efficient and affordable drugs to treat SaV infections.","Alfajaro, Mia Madel; Cho, Eun-Hyo; Kim, Deok-Song; Kim, Ji-Yun; Park, Jun-Gyu; Soliman, Mahmoud; Baek, Yeong-Bin; Park, Chul-Ho; Kang, Mun-Il; Park, Sang-Ik; Cho, Kyoung-Oh",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30463963/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01773-18,583

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the antibiotic azithromycin (AZ) are still being used by thousands and numerous hospitals to treat COVID-19. In a related context, immunotherapy using checkpoint blockade (ICB) with antibodies such as anti-PD-1 has revolutionised cancer therapy. Given that cancer patients on ICB continue to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, an understanding of the effects of HCQ and AZ on the elimination of tumors by anti-PD-1 ICB is urgently needed. In this study, we report that HCQ alone, or in combination with AZ, at doses used to treat COVID-19 patients, reverses the therapeutic benefit of anti-PD-1 in controlling B16 melanoma tumor growth in mice. No deleterious effect was seen on untreated tumors, or in using AZ alone in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Mechanistically, HCQ and HCQ/AZ inhibited PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, while specifically targeting the anti-PD-1 induced increase in progenitor CD8+CD44+PD-1+TCF1+ tumor-infiltrating T-cells (TILs) and the generation of CD8+CD44+PD-1+ effectors. Surprisingly, it also blocked the appearance of a subset of terminally exhausted CD8+ TILs. No effect was seen on the presence of CD4+ T-cells, FoxP3+ Tregs, thymic subsets, B-cells, antibody production, myeloid cells, or the vasculature of mice. Lastly, we identified TCF-1 expression in peripheral CD8+ T-cells from cancer or non-cancer human patients infected with SARs CoV2 as a marker for the effects of COVID-19 and HCQ on the immune system.

We aim to develop and validate a reliable aging-related gene pair signature (ARGPs) to predict the prognosis of gastric cancer (GC) patients. METHODS: The mRNA expression data and clinical information were obtained from two public databases, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset, respectively. The best prognostic signature was established using Cox regression analysis (univariate and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). The optimal cut-off value to distinguish between high- and low-risk patients was found by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The prognostic ability of the ARGPS was evaluated by a log‐rank test and a Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS: The 24 ARGPs were constructed for GC prognosis. Using the optimal cut-off value − 0.270, all patients were stratified into high risk and low risk. In both TCGA and GEO cohorts, the results of Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that the high-risk group has a poor prognosis (P < 0.001, P = 0.002, respectively). Then, we conducted a subgroup analysis of age, gender, grade and stage, and reached the same conclusion. After adjusting for a variety of clinical and pathological factors, the results of multivariate COX regression analysis showed that the ARGPs is still an independent prognostic factor of OS (HR, 4.919; 95% CI 3.345–7.235; P < 0.001). In comparing with previous signature, the novel signature was superior, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.845 vs. 0.684 vs. 0.695. The results of immune infiltration analysis showed that the abundance of T cells follicular helper was significantly higher in the low-risk group, while the abundance of monocytes was the opposite. Finally, we identified and incorporated independent prognostic factors and developed a superior nomogram to predict the prognosis of GC patients.

While the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed standardization for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation of a 387 nt region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with whole-genome analyses based on designated holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses are sufficient for the attribution of subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, MyCoV, which provides a method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution.","Wilkinson, David A.; Joffrin, Léa; Lebarbenchon, Camille; Mavingui, Patrick",J Gen Virol,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32902374/,583
616003,Average lifetime lost (ALL): a descriptive statistic for assessing disease fatality with a COVID-19 example,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND: The clinical efficiency of laser treatments is limited by the low penetration of visible light used in certain procedures like photodynamic therapy (PDT). Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) PDT is an innovative technique to overcome this limitation that enables the use of Near Infrared (NIR) light instead of visible light. NIR frequency bands present an optical window for deeper penetration into biological tissue. In this research, we compare the penetration depths of 405 and 808 nm continuous wave (CW) lasers and 808 nm pulsed wave (PW) laser in two different modes (high and low frequency). METHODS: Increasing thicknesses of beef and chicken tissue samples were irradiated under CW and PW lasers to determine penetration depths. RESULTS: The 808 nm CW laser penetrates 2.3 and 2.4 times deeper than the 405 nm CW laser in beef and chicken samples, respectively. 808 nm PW (pulse frequency—500 Hz) penetrates deeper than CW laser at the same wavelength. Further, increasing the pulse frequency achieves higher penetration depths. High frequency 808 nm PW (pulse frequency—71.4 MHz) penetrates 7.4- and 6.0-times deeper than 405 nm CW laser in chicken and beef, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the higher penetration depths of high frequency PW laser compared to low frequency PW laser, CW laser of the same wavelength and CW laser with half the wavelength. The results indicate that integrating SHG in the PDT process along with pulsed NIR light may allow the treatment of 6–7 times bigger tumours than conventional PDT using blue light.","Barbora, Ayan; Bohar, Oryan; Sivan, Ariel Alexander; Magory, Eyal; Nause, Ariel; Minnes, Refael",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411831/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245350,583

These are based on the fact that ACE2 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 cell invasion via binding of a viral spike protein to ACE2. However, the effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs and other drugs on ACE2 is unclear and all theories are based on conflicting evidence mainly from animal studies. Therefore, clinical evidence is urgently needed. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between use of these drugs on clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19. Patients will be included from several hospitals in Europe. Data will be collected in a user-friendly database (Digitalis) on an external server.

A role for nitric oxide in controlling infection remains debatable; thus, we monitored nitric oxide levels in blood and liver of immunized and nonimmunized spf mice during infection by electron paramagnetic resonance. In parallel, liver histology, virus titers, and plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity were monitored. Nitric oxide synthesis was barely detectable in BALB/c mice, which showed a progressive increase in virus titers and ALT activity. These animals died with a shorter survival time than A/J mice. The latter displayed a less severe infection and presented detectable levels of nitric oxide as nitrosyl complexes in blood and liver at 72 hpi. Immunized mice from both strains became resistant to MHV-3 and showed comparable levels of nitrosyl complexes in blood and liver at an early time (24 hpi). Thereafter, nitric oxide levels decreased but remained detectable in blood up to 96 hpi. Immunized mice were capable of clearing the virus and clearance was inhibited by administration of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. Overall, the results support a role for nitric oxide in controlling MHV-3 infection.","Tsuhako, Maria H.; Augusto, Ohara; Linares, Edlaine; Dagli, Maria L.Z.; Pereira, Carlos A.",Free Radic Biol Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0891584906005168; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584906005168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17045921/,583

The most amount of the death toll is accounted by old people affected by age-related diseases that develop a hyper-inflammatory syndrome. In this regard, we hypothesized that COVID-19 severity may be linked to inflammaging. Here, we examined 30 serum samples from patients enrolled in the clinical trial NCT04315480 assessing the clinical response to a single-dose intravenous infusion of the anti-IL-6 receptor drug Tocilizumab (TCZ) in COVID-19 patients with multifocal interstitial pneumonia. In these serum samples, as well as in 29 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects, we assessed a set of microRNAs that regulate inflammaging, i.e. miR-146a-5p, miR-21-5p, and miR-126-3p, which were quantified by RT-PCR and Droplet Digital PCR. We showed that COVID-19 patients who did not respond to TCZ have lower serum levels of miR-146a-5p after the treatment (p = 0.007). Among non-responders, those with the lowest serum levels of miR-146a-5p experienced the most adverse outcome (p = 0.008). Our data show that a blood-based biomarker, such as miR-146a-5p, can provide clues about the molecular link between inflammaging and COVID-19 clinical course, thus allowing to better understand the use of biologic drug armory against this worldwide health threat.","Sabbatinelli, Jacopo; Giuliani, Angelica; Matacchione, Giulia; Latini, Silvia; Laprovitera, Noemi; Pomponio, Giovanni; Ferrarini, Alessia; Svegliati Baroni, Silvia; Pavani, Marianna; Moretti, Marco; Gabrielli, Armando; Procopio, Antonio Domenico; Ferracin, Manuela; Bonafè, Massimiliano; Olivieri, Fabiola",Mech Ageing Dev,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047637420302098?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33307107/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0047637420302098; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mad.2020.111413,583
621711,"The epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and management toward COVID-19 patients with Type 2 diabetes: a systematic review",2021-09-06,"Objective: The current study seeks to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Data were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the socio-demographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. Results: Twitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. Conclusions: Exposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted.","Chartier, K. G.; Guidry, J. P. D.; Lee, C.

622082,Social and psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with Parkinson’s disease: Scoping review,2021-09-01,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to quantify the motion dynamics of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: Three physical models of Newton’s and Stokes’s laws with(out) air resistance in the calm air are used to determine the falling time and velocity regimes of SARS-CoV-2 with(out) a respiratory water droplet of 1 to 2000 micrometers (µm) in diameter of an infected person of 0.5 to 2.6 m in height. RESULTS: The horizontal distance travelled by SARS-CoV-2 in free fall from 1.7 m was 0.88 m due to breathing or talking and 2.94 m due to sneezing or coughing. According to Newton’s laws of motion with air resistance, its falling velocity and time from 1.7 m were estimated at 3.95 × 10(−2) m s(−1) and 43 s, respectively. Large droplets > 100 µm reached the ground from 1.7 m in less than 1.6 s, while the droplets ≥ 30 µm fell within 4.42 s regardless of the human height. Based on Stokes’s law, the falling time of the droplets encapsulating SARS-CoV-2 ranged from 4.26 × 10(−3) to 8.83 × 10(4) s as a function of the droplet size and height. CONCLUSION: The spread dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic is closely coupled to the falling dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 for which Newton’s and Stokes’s laws appeared to be applicable mostly to the respiratory droplet size ≥ 237.5 µm and ≤ 237.5 µm, respectively. An approach still remains to be desired so as to better quantify the motion of the nano-scale objects.","Aydin, Mehmet; Evrendilek, Fatih; Savas, Seckin Aydin; Aydin, Ismail Erkan; Evrendilek, Deniz Eren",J Med Biol Eng,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40846-020-00575-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100940/,583

In stochastic multicriteria decision-making models, the risk attitude of the decision maker is a relevant factor. Traditionally, the shape of a utility function is the only element that represents the decision maker’s risk attitude. The eduction process of multi-attribute utility functions implies some operational drawbacks, and it is not always easy. In this paper, we propose a new element with which the decision maker’s risk attitude can be implemented: the selection of the stochastic efficiency concept to be used during a decision analysis. We suggest representing the risk attitude as a conflict between two poles: risk neutral attitude, associated with best expectations, and risk aversion attitude, associated with a lower uncertainty. The Extended Goal Programming formulation has inspired the parameter that is introduced in a new risk attitude formulation. This parameter reflects the trade-off between the two classical poles with respect to risk attitude. Thus, we have produced a new stochastic efficiency concept that we call Compromise Efficiency.","Ribes, Juan; González-Pachón, Jacinto",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126536; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34204460/,583

The current study was conducted to determine the health effects of teleworking during an emergency statement as evidence for future policy development. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study in which we administered an online questionnaire to 5,214 general workers (response rate = 36.4%) from June 2020 to August 2020. Based on working methods during the pandemic, workers were categorized into the office group (n = 86) and telework group (n = 1597), and we characterized their demographics, changes in lifestyle, telework status, physical symptoms, and mental health. RESULTS: The results showed that the workers’ residence, marital status, management positions, and employee status affected the choice of the work method. During the emergency, teleworkers experienced more changes in their habits than office workers. In terms of exercise habits, 67.0% of the individuals belonging to the office-telework (OT) group exercised less. Approximately half of the teleworkers were satisfied with their telework, and those in the OT group were less satisfied with their telework than those in the telework-telework (TT) group, and they reported an increase in both working hours and meeting hours. Work-family conflict was more pronounced in the TT group than in the two other groups. Only 13.2% of individuals did not experience any stress in the past 30 days, and all three groups showed varying degrees of anxiety and depressive tendencies. In addition, all teleworkers experienced adverse physical symptoms before and after the emergency.

624965,Caring for people who care: supporting health workers during the COVID 19 pandemic.,2020-11-01,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with fast spreading all over the world caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus which can culminate in a severe acute respiratory syndrome by the injury caused in the lungs. However, other organs can be also damaged. SARS-CoV-2 enter into the host cells using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as receptor, like its ancestor SARS-CoV. ACE2 is then downregulated in lung tissues with augmented serum levels of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Interestingly, ACE2(+) organs reveal the symptomatic repercussions, which are signals of the infection such as dry cough, shortness of breath, heart failure, liver and kidney damage, anosmia or hyposmia, and diarrhea. ACE2 exerts a chief role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by converting angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7) that activates Mas receptor, inhibits ACE1, and modulates bradykinin (BK) receptor sensitivity, especially the BK type 2 receptor (BKB2R). ACE2 also hydrolizes des-Arg(9)-bradykinin (DABK), an active BK metabolite, agonist at BK type 1 receptors (BKB1R), which is upregulated by inflammation. In this opinion article, we conjecture a dialogue by the figure of Sérgio Ferreira which brought together basic science of classical pharmacology and clinical repercussions in COVID-19, then we propose that in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection: i) downregulation of ACE2 impairs the angiotensin II and DABK inactivation; ii) BK and its metabolite DABK seems to be in elevated levels in tissues by interferences in kallikrein/kinin system; iii) BK1 receptor contributes to the outbreak and maintenance of the inflammatory response; iv) kallikrein/kinin system crosstalks to RAS and coagulation system, linking inflammation to thrombosis and organ injury. We hypothesize that targeting the kallikrein/kinin system and BKB1R pathway may be beneficial in SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially on early stages. This route of inference should be experimentally verified by SARS-CoV-2 infected mice.","Nicolau, Lucas A.D.; Magalhães, Pedro J.C.; Vale, Mariana L.",Med Hypotheses,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720311063; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720311063?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32504925/,583

OBJECTIVE: To conduct an updated and comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis comparing mortality and severe adverse events (AEs) associated with receipt vs nonreceipt of ACEIs or ARBs among patients with COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase databases were systematically searched from December 31, 2019, until September 1, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: The meta-analysis included any study design, with the exception of narrative reviews or opinion-based articles, in which COVID-19 was diagnosed through laboratory or radiological test results and in which clinical outcomes (unadjusted or adjusted) associated with COVID-19 were assessed among adult patients (≥18 years) receiving ACEIs or ARBs. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Three authors independently extracted data on mortality and severe AEs associated with COVID-19. Severe AEs were defined as intensive care unit admission or the need for assisted ventilation. For each outcome, a random-effects model was used to compare the odds ratio (OR) between patients receiving ACEIs or ARBs vs those not receiving ACEIs or ARBs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Unadjusted and adjusted ORs for mortality and severe AEs associated with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 1788 records from the PubMed and Embase databases were identified; after removal of duplicates, 1664 records were screened, and 71 articles underwent full-text evaluation. Clinical data were pooled from 52 eligible studies (40 cohort studies, 6 case series, 4 case-control studies, 1 randomized clinical trial, and 1 cross-sectional study) enrolling 101 949 total patients, of whom 26 545 (26.0%) were receiving ACEIs or ARBs. When adjusted for covariates, significant reductions in the risk of death (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43-0.76; P < .001) and severe AEs (aOR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.88; P < .001) were found. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses of a subgroup of patients with hypertension indicated decreases in the risk of death (unadjusted OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.49-0.91]; P = .01; aOR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.32-0.84]; P = .008) and severe AEs (unadjusted OR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.54-0.91]; P = .007; aOR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.36-0.85]; P = .007). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, receipt of ACEIs or ARBs was not associated with a higher risk of multivariable-adjusted mortality and severe AEs among patients with COVID-19 who had either hypertension or multiple comorbidities, supporting the recommendations of medical societies. On the contrary, ACEIs and ARBs may be associated with protective benefits, particularly among patients with hypertension. Future randomized clinical trials are warranted to establish causality.","Baral, Ranu; Tsampasian, Vasiliki; Debski, Maciej; Moran, Brendan; Garg, Pankaj; Clark, Allan; Vassiliou, Vassilios S.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33787911/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.3594,583

We aimed at quantifying the lung deposition of poractant alfa with a new supraglottic delivery system for surfactant atomization in an experimental neonatal model. METHODS: The method involved six sedated 1-day-old piglets lying in the lateral decubitus, spontaneously breathing on nasal-mask continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP). A pharyngeal cannula housing a multi-channel air-blasting atomization catheter was placed through the mouth with its tip above the glottis entrance. In all, 200 mg kg(−1) of a (99m)Tc-surfactant mixture was atomized through the catheter synchronously with inspiration. Six intubated control piglets received an equal amount of intratracheally instilled (99m)Tc-surfactant mixture. The percentage of the (99m)Tc-surfactant mixture deposited in the lungs was estimated by scintigraphy. RESULTS: Median (range) deposition in the lungs was 40% (24–68%) after atomization and 87% (55–95%) after instillation (p < 0.001). Overall, almost 80% of the deposited surfactant was in the dependent lung. Effective atomization time (atomizer on) was 28 (17–52) min, yielding an output rate of 0.1–0.2 mL min(−1). CONCLUSIONS: Without endotracheal intubation, in spontaneously breathing newborn piglets, this new supraglottic atomizer delivery system attained a median lung deposition of 40% of the nominal dose of surfactant.","Nord, Anders; Linner, Rikard; Milesi, Ilaria; Zannin, Emanuela; di Castri, Marco; Bianco, Federico; Dellacá, Raffaele L.; Cunha-Goncalves, Doris; Perez-de-Sa, Valeria",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31785590/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0696-x,583

The Blueprint for a Safer Economy assigns each of California's 58 counties into 1 of 4 tiers based on 2 metrics: test positivity rate and adjusted case rate. To advance to the next less-restrictive tier, counties must meet that tier's test positivity and adjusted case rate thresholds. In addition, counties must have a plan for targeted investments within disadvantaged communities, and counties with more than 106 000 residents must meet an equity metric. California's explicit incorporation of health equity into its reopening plan underscores the interrelated fate of its residents during the COVID-19 pandemic and creates incentives for action. This article evaluates the benefits and challenges of this novel health equity focus, and outlines recommendations for other US states to address disparities in their reopening plans.","Largent, Emily A; Persad, Govind; Mello, Michelle M; Wenner, Danielle M; Kramer, Daniel B; Edmonds, Brownsyne Tucker; Peek, Monica",Am J Public Health,https://doi.org/10.2105/ajph.2021.306263; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34111945/,583

Methods: An epidemiological scenario analysis was developed in order to simulate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Italian national healthcare system in 2021. Hospitalisations, ICU admissions and death rates were modelled based on 2020 data. We forecast the impact of the introduction of a primary prevention strategy on the national healthcare system by considering vaccine efficacy, availability of doses and potential population coverage over time. Results: In the absence of immunisation, between 57,000 and 63,000 additional deaths are forecast in 2021. Based on the assumptions underlying the two epidemiological scenarios from the 2020 data, our model predicts that cumulative hospital admissions in 2021 will range from 3.4 to 3.9 million. The deployment of vaccine immunisation has the potential to control the evolution of 2021 infections and avoid from 60 to 67 percent of deaths compared to not vaccinating. Conclusions: In order to inform Italian policymakers on delivering a mass vaccination programme, this study highlights and detects some key factors that must be controlled to ensure that immunisation targets will be met in reasonable time.","Marcellusi, A.; Fabiano, G.; Sciattella, P.; Andreoni, M.; Mennini, F.

625933,Qatar's Primary Health Care Medication Home Delivery Service: A Response Toward COVID-19,2021-03-17,"It has previously been shown that a novel blend of carbohydrates could preserve lobster meat after 6 months of frozen storage. Increased year-round demand for high-quality lobster may make selling to the frozen seafood market an unintended option for some fishermen. Yet, the chemical and sensory changes that occur in lobster meat after one-year frozen storage in this cryoprotectant blend is not known. The objective of this study was to determine the chemical and sensory characteristics of lobster frozen in five different solutions: solution-1 (water); solution-2 (water + NaCl + STPP, sodium tripolyphosphate, 0.5%); solution-3 (water + NaCl + carbohydrate blend); solution-4 (water + NaCl + STPP, 0.25% + carbohydrate blend), and solution-5 (water + NaCl + STPP, 0.5% + carbohydrate blend). No difference (P > 0.05) existed among the treatments with regard to Malondialdehyde levels as a measure of lipid oxidation. Lobster frozen in the cryoprotectant showed increased tenderness, compared to the control which was frozen in water. The lobster meat treated with a combination of the carbohydrate blend and STPP had lower (P < 0.05) moisture content than the control. In addition, consumers preferred (P < 0.05) lobster frozen in the novel cryoprotectant blend and STPP with respect to flavour, texture, and overall acceptability compared to the control. Penalty analysis revealed that overall liking scores were positively associated with the attributes moist and sweet. In conclusion, the combination of the novel carbohydrate blend and STPP enhanced the sensory quality and the chemical properties of frozen lobster, which in turn extended the shelf‐life of these products. These findings may have wide implications for the long-term preservation of frozen lobster meat.","English, Marcia M.; Scrosati, Pablo M.; Aquino, Anthony J.; McSweeney, Matthew B.; Gulum Razul, M.

In response to this ongoing shortage, we began production of VTM in-house in support of diagnostic testing in our hospital network. As our diagnostic laboratory was not equipped for reagent production, we took advantage of space and personnel that became available due to closure of the research division of our medical center. We utilized a formulation of VTM described by the CDC that was simple to produce, did not require filtration for sterilization, and used reagents that were available from commercial suppliers. Performance of VTM was evaluated by several quality assurance measures. Based on cycle threshold (C(T)) values of spiking experiments, we found that our VTM supported highly consistent amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 target (coefficient of variation = 2.95%) using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) assay on the Abbott m2000 platform. VTM was also found to be compatible with multiple swab types and, based on accelerated stability studies, able to maintain functionality for at least 4 months at room temperature. We further discuss how we met logistical challenges associated with large-scale VTM production in a crisis setting, including use of a staged assembly line for VTM transport tube production.","Smith, Kenneth P.; Cheng, Annie; Chopelas, Amber; DuBois-Coyne, Sarah; Mezghani, Ikram; Rodriguez, Shade; Talay, Mustafa; Kirby, James E.",J Clin Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00913-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404481/,583

The exaggerated host immune response, incapable of viral clearance, instead aggravates respiratory distress, as well as cardiac and/or damage to other organs. The mortality pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infection, higher in older vs younger adults and almost absent in children, is possibly caused by the effects of age and pre-existing co-morbidities on innate and adaptive immunity. Here, w speculate that the abnormal and excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection partly depends on T cell immunological memory, that is more pronounced in adults compared to children, and may significantly contribute to immunopathology and massive collateral damage in COVID-19 patients.","de Candia, Paola; Prattichizzo, Francesco; Garavelli, Silvia; Matarese, Giuseppe",Trends Immunol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S147149062030260X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2020.11.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33277181/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147149062030260X?v=s5,583

Punt Politics refers to national leaders in federal systems deferring or deflecting responsibility for health systems decision-making to sub-national entities without evidence or coordination. The fragmentation of authority and overlapping functions in federal, decentralized political systems make them more susceptible to coordination problems than centralized, unitary systems. We apply the concept to pandemics, which require national health system stewardship, using sub-national NPI data that we developed and curated through the Observatory for the Containment of COVID-19 in the Americas to illustrate Punt Politics in Mexico and Brazil. Both countries suffer from protracted, high levels of COVID-19 mortality and inadequate pandemic responses, including little testing and disregard for scientific evidence. We illustrate how populist leadership drove Punt Politics and how partisan politics contributed to disabling an evidence-based response in Mexico and Brazil. These cases illustrate the combination of decentralization and populist leadership that is most conducive to punting responsibility. We discuss how Punt Politics reduces health system functionality, providing lessons for other countries and future pandemic responses, including vaccine rollout.","Knaul, Felicia Marie; Touchton, Michael; Arreola-Ornelas, Héctor; Atun, Rifat; Anyosa, Renzo JC Calderon; Frenk, Julio; Martínez-Valle, Adolfo; McDonald, Tim; Porteny, Thalia; Sánchez-Talanquer, Mariano; Victora, Cesar",Lancet Reg Health Am,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2021.100086; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667193X2100082X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X2100082X,583

METHODS: During April and May 2020 a cross‐sectional quantitative study was performed. Data from 3915 households were analyzed. The study of FNS was performed with the Latin American and Caribbean Scale for Food Security. To identify associated factors, bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were applied. RESULTS: Household food insecurity affected 55.9% of the sample (mild: 39.3%, moderate: 10.8%, severe: 5.8%). Analyzing the spatial distribution, the eastern area showed the highest food insecurity prevalence, followed by the south and west areas. Logistic regression analysis showed that household food insecurity varied according to household size, presence of children, socioeconomic status, and health area of residence. CONCLUSIONS: Household size, presence of children, socioeconomic status and public health area of residence were associated to household food insecurity.

Although Ghana did not record (and is yet to) any case, and several health workers have received numerous training schemes, there is no record of any study that assessed preparedness of healthcare workers (HCWS) regarding EVD and any emergency prone disease in Ghana. We therefore conducted a hospital based cross sectional study involving 101 HCWs from two facilities in Kumasi, Ghana to assess the level of preparedness of HCWs to respond to any possible EVD. METHODS: We administered a face-to-face questionnaire using an adapted WHO (2015) and CDC (2014) Checklist for Ebola Preparedness and assessed overall knowledge gaps, and preparedness of the Ghanaian HCWs in selected health facilities of the Ashanti Region of Ghana from October to December 2015. RESULTS: A total 92 (91.09%) HCWs indicated they were not adequately trained to handle an EVD suspected case. Only 25.74% (n = 26) considered their facilities sufficiently equipped to handle and manage EVD patients. When asked which disinfectant to use after attending to and caring for a suspected patient with EVD, only 8.91% (n = 9) could correctly identify the right disinfectant (χ(2) = 28.52, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates poor knowledge and ill preparedness and unwillingness of many HCWs to attend to EVD. Beyond knowledge acquisition, there is the need for more training from time to time to fully prepare HCWs to handle any possible EVD case.","Annan, Augustina Angelina; Yar, Denis Dekugmen; Owusu, Michael; Biney, Eno Akua; Forson, Paa Kobina; Okyere, Portia Boakye; Gyimah, Akosua Adumea; Owusu-Dabo, Ellis",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28587602/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-017-4474-6,583

However, there have been no multicenter studies on how the number of hospitalized children with various infectious diseases changed before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 in Japan. Methods We conducted a multicenter, prospective survey for hospitalized pediatric patients in 18 hospitals in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan, from July 2019 to February 2021. We defined July 2019 to February 2020 as pre-COVID-19, and July 2020 to February 2021 as post-COVID-19. We surveyed various infectious diseases by sex and age. Results In total, 5,300 patients were hospitalized during the study period. The number of patients decreased from 4,266 in the pre-COVID-19 period to 701 (16.4%) post-COVID-19. Patients with influenza and RSV decreased from 308 and 795 pre-COVID-19 to zero and three (0.4%) post-COVID-19. However, patients with adenovirus (respiratory infection) only decreased to 60.9% (46 to 28) of pre-COVID levels. Patients with rotavirus, norovirus, and adenovirus gastroenteritis decreased markedly post-COVID-19 to 2.6% (38 to 1), 27.8% (97 to 27) and 13.5% (37 to 5). The number of patients with UTIs was similar across the two periods (109 and 90). KD patients decreased to 31.7% (161 to 51) post-COVID-19. Conclusions We suggest that current infection control measures for COVID-19 such as wearing masks, washing hands, and disinfecting hands with alcohol are effective against various infectious diseases.

The system consists of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) step to amplify target viral DNA, followed by detection of the amplified DNA using a membrane-anchored probe array and an avidin-alkaline phosphatase (Av-AP) indicator system. The lower limit of detection of PCV using the miniarray was 10(1.9) tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID(50))/ml and 10(2.08)TCID(50)/ml for PCV1 and PCV2, respectively, and 100 viral copies/μl for both PCV1 and PCV2. We validated the miniarray system using 141 lymph node specimens from pigs with suspected postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome or porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome. Of the 141 samples evaluated, 55 were identified as positive for PCV by the miniarray. Relative to in situ hybridization, the sensitivity and specificity of the miniarray was 100% and 98.9%, respectively. In contrast to other microarray systems, the miniarray does not require a DNA chip reader, since the results can be determined by visual inspection of colorized spots on a nylon membrane.

We use a combination of genomic analysis and sensitive profile-based sequence and structure analysis to understand the potential pathogenesis determinants of this virus. As a result, we identify several fast-evolving genomic regions that might be at the interface of virus-host interactions, corresponding to the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein, the three tandem Macro fold domains in ORF1a, and the uncharacterized protein ORF8. Further, we show that ORF8 and several other proteins from alpha- and beta-CoVs belong to novel families of immunoglobulin (Ig) proteins. Among them, ORF8 is distinguished by being rapidly evolving, possessing a unique insert, and having a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its predicted ligand-binding groove. We also uncover numerous Ig domain proteins from several unrelated metazoan viruses, which are distinct in sequence and structure but share comparable architectures to those of the CoV Ig domain proteins. Hence, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 and other previously unidentified CoV Ig domain proteins fall under the umbrella of a widespread strategy of deployment of Ig domain proteins in animal viruses as pathogenicity factors that modulate host immunity. The rapid evolution of the ORF8 Ig domain proteins points to a potential evolutionary arms race between viruses and hosts, likely arising from immune pressure, and suggests a role in transmission between distinct host species.","Tan, Yongjun; Schneider, Theresa; Leong, Matthew; Aravind, L.; Zhang, Dapeng",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32471829/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00760-20,583

Historically, the use of antibody therapy was based on multiple targets including receptors involved in local hyper-reactivity in asthma, viruses and micro-organisms involved in a variety of pulmonary infectious disease. Generally, protein therapeutics pose challenges with respect to formulation and delivery to retain activity and assure therapy.

636875,A Rapid Guidance Process for the Development of an Anticoagulation Protocol in the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-05-26,"The future of awake bruxism assessment will incorporate physiological data, possibly electromyography (EMG) of the temporal muscles. But up to now, temporal muscle contraction patterns in awake bruxism have not been characterized to demonstrate clinical utility. The present study aimed to perform surface EMG evaluations of people assessed for awake bruxism to identify possible different subtypes. A 2-year active search for people with awake bruxism in three regions of the country resulted in a total of 303 participants (223 women, 38 ± 13 years, mean and SD). Their inclusion was confirmed through non-instrumental approaches for awake bruxism: self-reported questionnaire and clinical exam, performed by three experienced and calibrated dentists (Kappa = 0.75). Also, 77 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited (49 women, 36 ± 14 years). Temporalis surface EMG was performed with a portable device (Myobox; NeuroUp, Brazil). EMG signals were sent to a computer via Bluetooth 4.0 at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz. Digital signal processing was performed using the commercial neuroUP software, transformed in RMS and then normalized for peak detection (EMG peaks/min), in a 10 min session. Cluster analysis revealed three distinct subtypes of awake bruxism: phasic, tonic, and intermediate. Individuals with a predominance of EMG peaks/min were classified as the “phasic” subtype (16.8%). Those with the highest EMG rest power were classified as the “tonic” subtype (32.3%). There was also an “intermediate” subtype (50.8%), when both variables remained low. Characterization of awake bruxism physiology is important for future establishment of instrumental assessment protocols and treatment strategies.","Monteiro, Ubirakitan Maciel; Soares, Vinicius Belém Rodrigues Barros; Soares, Caio Belém Rodrigues Barros; Pinto, Tiago Coimbra Costa; Ximenes, Rosana Christine Cavalcanti; Araújo Cairrão Rodrigues, Marcelo",Front Hum Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2020.601881; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584222/,583

There is a relative paucity of data regarding its effectiveness in the prevention of asymptomatic infection. METHODS: In this real-world observational study, we identified a subpopulation of individuals in a large health maintenance organization who were repeatedly tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We included these individuals in the study cohort and compared those who were vaccinated with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to unvaccinated individuals. A positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result was used as the outcome. The follow-up period was from January 1, 2021, until February 11, 2021. RESULTS: A total of 6286 individuals were included in the cohort. Seven days after the second vaccine dose, a rate of 6 positive PCR tests per 10 000 person-days was recorded, compared with a rate of 53 positive tests per 10 000 person-days for the unvaccinated group. The estimated vaccine effectiveness against infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus after 2 vaccine doses was 89% (95% CI, 82%–94%). The estimated effectiveness 2 weeks after the first vaccine dose was 61% (95% CI, 49%–71%). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, vaccination with BNT162b2 reduced infection rates among individuals who underwent screening by frequent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Using a cohort of frequently tested individuals reduced the indication bias for the PCR testing, which enabled estimation of infection rates.","Zacay, Galia; Shasha, David; Bareket, Ronen; Kadim, Itai; Hershkowitz Sikron, Fabienne; Tsamir, Judith; Mossinson, David; Heymann, Anthony D",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189176/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab262,583

If not balanced, the inflammation may cause extensive tissue damage, which is associated with common diseases, e.g., asthma and atherosclerosis. Anti‐inflammatory drugs come with side effects that may be aggravated by high and fluctuating drug concentrations. To remedy this, an anti‐inflammatory drug should have an appropriate pharmacokinetic half‐life or better still, a sustained anti‐inflammatory drug response. However, we still lack a quantitative mechanistic understanding of such sustained effects. Here, we study the anti‐inflammatory response to a common glucocorticoid drug, dexamethasone. We find a sustained response 22 hours after drug removal. With hypothesis testing using mathematical modeling, we unravel the underlying mechanism—a slow release of dexamethasone from the receptor–drug complex. The developed model is in agreement with time‐resolved training and testing data and is used to simulate hypothetical treatment schemes. This work opens up for a more knowledge‐driven drug development to find sustained anti‐inflammatory responses and fewer side effects.","Nyman, Elin; Lindh, Maria; Lövfors, William; Simonsson, Christian; Persson, Alexander; Eklund, Daniel; Bäckström, Erica; Fridén, Markus; Cedersund, Gunnar",CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33217190/; https://doi.org/10.1002/psp4.12568,583

The objective of the study is to analyze the barriers encountered by the glaucoma patients for the follow-up visit and medication adherence during the pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included glaucoma patients who did not attend the scheduled appointment from April 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020 in a tertiary eye care center (88.21%). Eligible patients of age >18 years and advised antiglaucoma medication in Madurai Zone were interviewed with validated questionnaire through telephonic call. RESULTS: 363 patients answered the questionnaire through telephonic interview. 57.3% of the patients were found to be non-adherent to medication. The main barriers for glaucoma follow-up visit during the pandemic were lockdown restriction, transport problem, and financial difficulties. The top barriers for medication adherence were non availability of medication (54.81%), financial difficulties (30.29%), did not feel much improvement with eye drops (20.19%). On multiple regression analysis, longer distance to hospital, low socioeconomic status, more than one antiglaucoma medication use, lack of awareness of glaucoma, non-complaint before COVID-19 and stress due to the pandemic were found to be significant factors for medication non adherence. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for reformation in health care system for accessibility of medical care to patients in rural areas. Decentralization of health system to primary care level and utilization of teleophthalmology should be considered by health care planners in future.","Subathra, GN; Rajendrababu, Sharmila R; Senthilkumar, Vijayalakshmi A; Mani, Iswarya; Udayakumar, B",Indian J Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33913874/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_164_21,583

Appendicitis is frequently managed by appendicectomy. After the onset of the pandemic, selected cases of appendicitis were managed with antibiotics which is a recognised treatment option. Our objective was to compare the management of appendicitis and post-operative outcomes between pre- and post-COVID-19. METHODS: Ninety-six patients were identified from before the onset of the pandemic (November 2019) to after the onset of the pandemic (May 2020). Data were collected retrospectively from electronic records including demographics, investigations, treatment, duration of inpatient stay, complications, readmissions and compared between pre- and post-COVID-19 groups. RESULTS: One hundred percent underwent surgical treatment before the onset of pandemic, compared with 56.3% from the onset of the pandemic. A greater percentage of patients were investigated with imaging post-COVID-19 (100% versus 60.9%; p < 0.00001). There was no significant difference in the outcomes between the two groups. CONCLUSION: CT/MRI scan was preferred to laparoscopy in diagnosing appendicitis and conservative management of uncomplicated appendicitis was common practice after the onset of pandemic. Health boards can adapt their management of surgical conditions during pandemics without adverse short-term consequences. Long term follow-up of this cohort will identify patients suitable for conservative management.","Ganesh, Radhakrishnan; Lucocq, James; Ekpete, Neville Ogbonnia; Ain, Noor Ul; Lim, Su Kwan; Alwash, Al; Bibi, Saira; Alijani, Afshin",Scott Med J,https://doi.org/10.1177/0036933020956316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32878574/,583

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) revealed a new variant, currently defining a novel SARS CoV 2 lineage: B.1.616. In March, WHO classified this variant as ""under investigation"" (VUI). We analyzed the characteristics and outcomes of COVID 19 cases related to this new variant. Methods: Clinical, virological, and radiological data were retrospectively collected from medical charts in the two hospitals involved. We enrolled patients with at least one of the following: i) positive SARS CoV 2 RT PCR on a respiratory sample; ii) seroconversion with anti SARS CoV 2 IgG/IgM; iii) suggestive symptoms and typical features of COVID 19 on chest CT scan. Cases were categorized as either: i) B.1.616; ii) variant of concern (VOC); iii) unknown. Findings: From January 1st to March 24th, 2021, 114 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria: B.1.616 (n=34), VOC (n=32), and unknown (n=48). B.1.616 related cases were older than VOC related cases (81 years [73-88], vs 73 years [67-82], P<0.05) and their first RT PCR tests were less often positive (5/34, 15% vs 31/32, 97%, P<0.05). The B.1.616 variant was independently associated with severe disease (multivariable Cox model HR 4.2 [1.3 , 13.5], P=0.018), and increased lethality (logrank test P=0.01): 28day mortality 15/34 (44%) with B.1.616, vs. 5/32 (16%) for VOC, P=0.036. Interpretation: We report a nosocomial outbreak of COVID-19 cases related to a new variant, B.1.616, poorly detected by RT PCR on nasopharyngeal samples, with high lethality.","FILLATRE, P.; DUFOUR, M.

Recent findings suggest that lncRNAs play various regulatory roles in multiple major biological and pathological processes. During viral life cycles, lncRNAs are involved in a series of steps, including enhancing viral gene expression, promoting viral replication and genome packaging, boosting virion release, maintaining viral latency and assisting viral transformation; additionally, lncRNAs antagonize host antiviral innate immune responses. In contrast to proteins that function in viral infection, lncRNAs are expected to be novel targets for the modulation of all types of biochemical processes due to their broad characteristics and profound influence. This review highlights our current understanding of the regulatory roles of lncRNAs during viral infection processes with an emphasis on the potential usefulness of lncRNAs as a target for viral intervention strategies, which could have therapeutic implications for the application of a clinical approach for the treatment of viral diseases.","Wang, Ziqiang; Zhao, Yiwan; Zhang, Yaou",Noncoding RNA Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468054016300294; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ncrna.2017.03.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30159419/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468054016300294,583

Data from cerebrospinal fluid analyses and postmortem samples have been shown that SARS-CoV-2 has neuroinvasive properties. Therefore, ongoing studies have focused on mechanisms involved in neurotropism and neural injuries of SARS-CoV-2. The inflammasome is a part of the innate immune system that is responsible for the secretion and activation of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and interleukin-18. Since cytokine storm has been known as a major mechanism followed by SARS-CoV-2, inflammasome may trigger an inflammatory form of lytic programmed cell death (pyroptosis) following SARS-CoV-2 infection and contribute to associated neurological complications. We reviewed and discussed the possible role of inflammasome and its consequence pyroptosis following coronavirus infections as potential mechanisms of neurotropism by SARS-CoV-2. Further studies, particularly postmortem analysis of brain samples obtained from COVID-19 patients, can shed light on the possible role of the inflammasome in neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2.","Sepehrinezhad, Ali; Gorji, Ali; Sahab Negah, Sajad",Inflammopharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34241783/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10787-021-00845-4,583

They are uneasy with the difficulty children have disengaging from screens and concerned that this behavior is obsessive or a sign of addiction. However, technology is recognized as having a “rightful role” in early childhood contexts. This scoping paper reports on a review of literature relating to digital play for children aged birth to five years, with the aim of further understanding digital wellbeing. Csikszentmihalyi’s flow theory serves as a theoretical framework for understanding why many young children enjoy digital play and become deeply engaged, with a disconnect between how young children and adults perceive digital play. Concerns about children’s deep immersion with digital play are interrogated to understand the connections with perceived addictive traits. The review highlights the critical importance of supporting children’s agency and digital citizenship skills from a young age, including the ability to critique content, balance screen-time with non-screen time and to develop self-control and self-regulation as a means to promote long-term positive outcomes for children in their digital lifeworlds and beyond.","Johnston, Kelly",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639481/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910179,583

In this paper, we explore the role of animal farming and meat consumption in the emergence and amplification of infectious diseases. First, we discuss how meat production increases epidemic risks, either directly through increased contact with wild and farmed animals or indirectly through its impact on the environment (e.g., biodiversity loss, water use, climate change). Traditional food systems such as bushmeat and backyard farming increase the risks of disease transmission from wild animals, while intensive farming amplifies the impact of the disease due to the high density, genetic proximity, increased immunodeficiency, and live transport of farmed animals. Second, we describe the various direct and indirect costs of animal-based infectious diseases, and in particular, how these diseases can negatively impact the economy and the environment. Last, we discuss policies to reduce the social costs of infectious diseases. While existing regulatory frameworks such as the “One Health” approach focus on increasing farms’ biosecurity and emergency preparedness, we emphasize the need to better align stakeholders’ incentives and to reduce meat consumption.

Cytokine storm refers to a set of clinical conditions caused by excessive immune reactions and has been recognized as a leading cause of severe COVID-19. While comparisons have been made between COVID-19 cytokine storm and other kinds of cytokine storm such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cytokine release syndrome, the pathogenesis of cytokine storm has not been clearly elucidated yet. Recent studies have shown that impaired response of type-1 IFNs in early stage of COVID-19 infection played a major role in the development of cytokine storm, and various cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1 were involved in severe COVID-19. Furthermore, many clinical evidences have indicated the importance of anti-inflammatory therapy in severe COVID-19. Several approaches are currently being used to treat the observed cytokine storm associated with COVID-19, and expectations are especially high for new cytokine-targeted therapies, such as tocilizumab, anakinra, and baricitinib. Although a number of studies have been conducted on anti-inflammatory treatments for severe COVID-19, no specific recommendations have been made on which drugs should be used for which patients and when.

The’omics revolution has enabled a better understanding of the biological basis of disease, unlocking the possibility of new products such as gene and cell therapies which offer novel patient centric solutions. Innovative approaches to clinical trial designs promise greater efficiency, and in recent years, scientific collaborations, and consortia have been developing novel approaches to leverage new sources of evidence such as real-world data, patient experience data, and biomarker data. Alongside this there have been great strides in digital innovation. Cloud computing has become mainstream and the internet of things and blockchain technology have become a reality. These examples of transformation stand in sharp contrast to the current inefficient approach for regulatory submission, review, and approval of medicinal products. This process has not fundamentally changed since the beginning of medicine regulation in the late 1960s. Fortunately, progressive initiatives are emerging that will enrich and streamline regulatory decision making and deliver patient centric therapies, if they are successful in transforming the current transactional construct and harnessing scientific and technological advances. Such a radical transformation will not be simple for both regulatory authorities and company sponsors, nor will progress be linear. We examine the shortcomings of the current system with its entrenched and variable business processes, offer examples of progress as catalysts for change, and make the case for a new cloud based model. To optimize navigation toward this reality we identify implications and regulatory design questions which must be addressed.

The impact of respiratory co-infection in SOTR with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) is unknown. A multicentre prospective study of consecutive cases of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) in SOTR was carried out to assess the clinical characteristics and outcome and the risk factors for co-infection. Overall, 51 patients were included. Median time from transplant was 3.7 years, 5.9% of the cases occurred perioperatively and 7.8% were hospitalacquired. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 15 (29.4%) patients. Ten cases were severe (19.6%): 13.7% were admitted to intensive care units, 5.9% suffered septic shock, 5.9% developed acute graft rejection and 7.8% died. Co-infection was detected in 15 patients (29.4%): eight viral, six bacterial and one fungal. Viral co-infection did not affect the outcome. Patients with non-viral co-infection had a worse outcome: longer hospital stay (26.2 ± 20.7 vs. 5.5 ± 10.2) and higher rate of severe diseases (85.7% vs. 2.3%) and mortality (42.8% vs. 2.3%). Independent risk factors for non-viral co-infection were: diabetes mellitus and septic shock. Other factors associated with severe influenza were: delayed antiviral therapy, diabetes mellitus, time since transplantation <90 days and pneumonia. In conclusion, pandemic influenza A can cause significant direct and indirect effects in SOTR, especially in the early post-transplant period, and should be treated early.

With the ease and speed of map-making, many map creators seem to forget about the fundamental principles of good and easy-to-read thematic choropleth maps, which requires geo-spatial data literacy. Geo-spatial data literacy is an important skill, to be able to judge the reliability of spatial data, and to create ingenuous thematic maps. This contribution intends to make people of disciplines other than those that are map-related aware of the power of thematic maps and how one can create trustworthy thematic maps instead of misleading thematic maps which could, in a worst case, lead to misinterpretation.","Juergens, Carsten",KN J Cartogr Geogr Inf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134849/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42489-020-00057-w,583

The impact of the March-June 2020 UK Covid-19 lockdown response on mental health: a longitudinal survey of mothers in the Born in Bradford study.,2020-11-30,"Currently, there is no widely acceptable and proven effective treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). Colchicine has been shown to offer a benefit in reducing the inflammation in several inflammatory diseases. This study aims to analyze the efficacy of colchicine administration and outcomes of COVID‐19. We systematically searched the PubMed and Europe PMC database using specific keywords related to our aims until January 29, 2021. All articles published on COVID‐19 and colchicine treatment were retrieved. The quality of the study was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) tool for observational studies and Revised Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) for clinical trial studies. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 software. A total of eight studies with 5778 COVID‐19 patients were included in this meta‐analysis. This meta‐analysis showed that the administration of colchicine was associated with improvement of outcomes of COVID‐19 [OR 0.43 (95% CI 0.34–0.55), p < 0.00001, I (2) = 0%, fixed‐effect modelling] and its subgroup which comprised of reduction from severe COVID‐19 [OR 0.44 (95% CI 0.31–0.63), p < 0.00001, I (2) = 0%, fixed‐effect modelling] and reduction of mortality rate from COVID‐19 [OR 0.43 (95% CI 0.32–0.58), p < 0.00001, I (2) = 0%, fixed‐effect modelling]. Our study suggests the routine use of colchicine for treatment modalities of COVID‐19 patients.

As of June 15, 2020, approximately 2 million cases and 115,000 COVID-19-associated deaths have been reported in the United States.* Reports of U.S. patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection (the virus that causes COVID-19) describe high proportions of older, male, and black persons (2-4). Similarly, when comparing hospitalized patients with catchment area populations or nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients, high proportions have underlying conditions, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or chronic respiratory disease (3,4). For this report, data were abstracted from the medical records of 220 hospitalized and 311 nonhospitalized patients aged ≥18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from six acute care hospitals and associated outpatient clinics in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia. Multivariable analyses were performed to identify patient characteristics associated with hospitalization. The following characteristics were independently associated with hospitalization: age ≥65 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.4), black race (aOR = 3.2), having diabetes mellitus (aOR = 3.1), lack of insurance (aOR = 2.8), male sex (aOR = 2.4), smoking (aOR = 2.3), and obesity (aOR = 1.9). Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can lead to severe outcomes, including death, and measures to protect persons from infection, such as staying at home, social distancing (5), and awareness and management of underlying conditions should be emphasized for those at highest risk for hospitalization with COVID-19. Measures that prevent the spread of infection to others, such as wearing cloth face coverings (6), should be used whenever possible to protect groups at high risk. Potential barriers to the ability to adhere to these measures need to be addressed.","Killerby, Marie E.; Link-Gelles, Ruth; Haight, Sarah C.; Schrodt, Caroline A.; England, Lucinda; Gomes, Danica J.; Shamout, Mays; Pettrone, Kristen; O'Laughlin, Kevin; Kimball, Anne; Blau, Erin F.; Burnett, Eleanor; Ladva, Chandresh N.; Szablewski, Christine M.; Tobin-D’Angelo, Melissa; Oosmanally, Nadine; Drenzek, Cherie; Murphy, David J.; Blum, James M.; Hollberg, Julie; Lefkove, Benjamin; Brown, Frank W.; Shimabukuro, Tom; Midgley, Claire M.; Tate, Jacqueline E.; Browning, Sean D.; Bruce, Beau B.; da Silva, Juliana; Gold, Jeremy A.W.; Jackson, Brendan R.; Bamrah Morris, Sapna; Natarajan, Pavithra; Neblett Fanfair, Robyn; Patel, Priti R.; Rogers-Brown, Jessica; Rossow, John; Wong, Karen K.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32584797/; https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6925e1,583
645205,County-Level Planning for Efficient Distribution of Emergency Medical Countermeasures with RealOpt Software,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis, yet certain countries have had far more success in limiting COVID-19 cases and deaths. We suggest that collective threats require a tremendous amount of coordination, and that strict adherence to social norms is a key mechanism that enables groups to do so. Here we examine how the strength of social norms—or cultural tightness–looseness—was associated with countries' success in limiting cases and deaths by October, 2020. We expected that tight cultures, which have strict norms and punishments for deviance, would have fewer cases and deaths per million as compared with loose cultures, which have weaker norms and are more permissive. METHODS: We estimated the relationship between cultural tightness–looseness and COVID-19 case and mortality rates as of Oct 16, 2020, using ordinary least squares regression. We fit a series of stepwise models to capture whether cultural tightness–looseness explained variation in case and death rates controlling for under-reporting, demographics, geopolitical factors, other cultural dimensions, and climate. FINDINGS: The results indicated that, compared with nations with high levels of cultural tightness, nations with high levels of cultural looseness are estimated to have had 4·99 times the number of cases (7132 per million vs 1428 per million, respectively) and 8·71 times the number of deaths (183 per million vs 21 per million, respectively), taking into account a number of controls. A formal evolutionary game theoretic model suggested that tight groups cooperate much faster under threat and have higher survival rates than loose groups. The results suggest that tightening social norms might confer an evolutionary advantage in times of collective threat. INTERPRETATION: Nations that are tight and abide by strict norms have had more success than those that are looser as of the October, 2020. New interventions are needed to help countries tighten social norms as they continue to battle COVID-19 and other collective threats.

Some apparently conflicting results are likely due to the intricacy of IFN subtypes (type I: IFN-alpha/beta, type III: IFN-lambda), timing and mode of administration (nebulized/subcutaneous) and clinical groups targeted (asymptomatic/mild, moderate, severe/critical COVID-19). Within the COntAGIouS (COvid-19 Advanced Genetic and Immunologic Sampling) clinical trial, we investigated endogenous type I and type III IFNs in nasal mucosa as possible predictors of clinical outcome in critical patients, as well as their correlation to SARS-CoV-2 viral load, using nCounter technology. We found that endogenous IFN-beta expression in the nasal mucosa predicts clinical outcome, independent of viral replication or Apache II score, and should be considered as a prognostic tool in a precision medicine approach of IFN therapy in COVID-19 clinical management.","MENEZES, S.

Such is the case, of the novel coronavirus SARS-Cov-2, which has expanded of exponential way, practically, to whole world population. For this reason, the enhancement of real microscopic images of this coronavirus is of great importance. Of this way, one can highlight the S-spikes and visualizing those areas that show a high density, which are related to active zones of viral germination and major spread of the virus. The SARS-Cov-2 images were captured from nasopharyngeal samples of Cuban symptomatic individuals (RT-PCR positives for SARS-CoV-2) and processed via scanning electron microscopy. However, many times these microscopic images present some blurring problems, and the S-spikes do not look well defined. Therefore, the aim of this work is to propose new computational methods to carry out enhancement and segmentation of SARS-Cov-2 high-resolution microscopic images. The proposed strategy obtained very satisfactory results, and we validated its performance, together with specialist physicians, on a set of 1005 images. Due to the importance of the obtained results, this first work will be addressed to the application of the proposed algorithm. A second paper will deeply analyze the theory related to these algorithms.","Rodríguez, Roberto; Mondeja, Brian A.; Valdés, Odalys; Resik, Sonia; Vizcaino, Ananayla; Acosta, Emilio F.; González, Yorexis; Kourí, Vivian; Díaz, Angelina; Guzmán, María G.",Signal Image Video Process,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33907588/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11760-021-01912-7,583

648473,Harnessing the Neurobiology of Resilience to Protect the Mental Well-Being of Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-03-18,"The envelope (E) protein from coronaviruses is a small polypeptide that contains at least one α-helical transmembrane domain. Absence, or inactivation, of E protein results in attenuated viruses, due to alterations in either virion morphology or tropism. Apart from its morphogenetic properties, protein E has been reported to have membrane permeabilizing activity. Further, the drug hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), but not amiloride, inhibited in vitro ion channel activity of some synthetic coronavirus E proteins, and also viral replication. We have previously shown for the coronavirus species responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) that the transmembrane domain of E protein (ETM) forms pentameric α-helical bundles that are likely responsible for the observed channel activity. Herein, using solution NMR in dodecylphosphatidylcholine micelles and energy minimization, we have obtained a model of this channel which features regular α-helices that form a pentameric left-handed parallel bundle. The drug HMA was found to bind inside the lumen of the channel, at both the C-terminal and the N-terminal openings, and, in contrast to amiloride, induced additional chemical shifts in ETM. Full length SARS-CoV E displayed channel activity when transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells in a whole-cell patch clamp set-up. This activity was significantly reduced by hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), but not by amiloride. The channel structure presented herein provides a possible rationale for inhibition, and a platform for future structure-based drug design of this potential pharmacological target.","Pervushin, Konstantin; Tan, Edward; Parthasarathy, Krupakar; Lin, Xin; Jiang, Feng Li; Yu, Dejie; Vararattanavech, Ardcharaporn; Soong, Tuck Wah; Liu, Ding Xiang; Torres, Jaume",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19593379/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000511,583

We aimed to analyse trends in the prevalence of mental disorders prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analysed data from repeated cross-sectional surveys on a representative sample of non-institutionalised Czech adults (18+ years) from both November 2017 (n = 3306; 54% females) and May 2020 (n = 3021; 52% females). We used Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) as the main screening instrument. We calculated descriptive statistics and compared the prevalence of current mood and anxiety disorders, suicide risk and alcohol-related disorders at baseline and right after the first peak of COVID-19 when related lockdown was still in place in CZ. In addition, using logistic regression, we assessed the association between COVID-19-related worries and the presence of mental disorders. RESULTS: The prevalence of those experiencing symptoms of at least one current mental disorder rose from a baseline of 20.02 (95% CI = 18.64; 21.39) in 2017 to 29.63 (95% CI = 27.9; 31.37) in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of both major depressive disorder (3.96, 95% CI = 3.28; 4.62 v. 11.77, 95% CI = 10.56; 12.99); and suicide risk (3.88, 95% CI = 3.21; 4.52 v. 11.88, 95% CI = 10.64; 13.07) tripled and current anxiety disorders almost doubled (7.79, 95% CI = 6.87; 8.7 v. 12.84, 95% CI = 11.6; 14.05). The prevalence of alcohol use disorders in 2020 was approximately the same as in 2017 (10.84, 95% CI = 9.78; 11.89 v. 9.88, 95% CI = 8.74; 10.98); however, there was a significant increase in weekly binge drinking behaviours (4.07% v. 6.39%). Strong worries about both, health or economic consequences of COVID-19, were associated with an increased odds of having a mental disorder (1.63, 95% CI = 1.4; 1.89 and 1.42, 95% CI = 1.23; 1.63 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence matching concerns that COVID-19-related mental health problems pose a major threat to populations, particularly considering the barriers in service provision posed during lockdown.

We characterized the mRNA copy number, glycosylation status, transduction efficiency, and innate immune property of the new vaccine platform. Importantly, we showed the ShaCoVacc induced strong spike-specific humoral immune responses and potent neutralizing activities by a single injection.

651750,The impact of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental and social health of children and adolescents,2020-11-04,"Abstract We have previously shown the presence of multiple small leader-containing RNA species in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected cells. In this paper, we have analyzed the origin, structure, and mechanism of synthesis of these small RNAs. Using cDNA probes specific for leader RNA and genes A, D, and F, we demonstrate that subsets of these small RNAs were derived from the various viral genes. These subsets have discrete and reproducible sizes, varying with the gene from which they are derived. The size of each subset correlates with regions of secondary structure, whose free energy ranges from −1.6 to −77.1 kcal/mol, in each of the mRNAs examined. In addition, identical subsets were detected on the replicative intermediate (RI) RNA, suggesting that they represent functional transcriptional intermediates. The biological significance of these small RNAs is further supported by the detection of leader-containing RNAs of 47, 50, and 57 nucleotides in length, which correspond to the crossover sites in two MHV recombinant viruses. These data, coupled with the high frequency of RNA recombination during MHV infection, suggest that the viral polymerase may pause in or around regions of secondary structure, thereby generating pools of free leader-containing RNA intermediates which can reassociate with the template, acting as primers for the synthesis of full-length or recombinant RNAs. These data suggest that MHV transcription uses a discontinuous and nonprocessive mechanism in which RNA polymerase allows the partial RNA products to be dissociated from the template temporarily during the process of transcription.","Baric, Ralph S.; Shieh, Chien-Kou; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682287904144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3027983/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682287904144,583

Typically, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella-zoster, and enterovirus are responsible for a high number of cases in immunocompetent hosts, whereas other herpesviruses (for example, cytomegalovirus) are the most common in immunocompromised individuals. Arboviruses have also been associated with outbreaks with a high burden of neurological disorders, such as the Zika virus epidemic in Brazil. There is a current lack of understanding in Brazil about the most common viruses involved in CNS infections. In this review, we briefly summarize the most recent studies and findings associated with the CNS, in addition to epidemiological data that provide extensive information on the circulation and diversity of the most common neuro-invasive viruses in Brazil. We also highlight important aspects of the prion-associated diseases. This review provides readers with better knowledge of virus-associated CNS infections.

Patients were divided in 2 groups (severe and critical) according to the World health organization definition. FINDINGS: From 19(th) of March to 7(th) of April 2020, 43 patients were included. Fourteen patients (33%) were in the severe group and twenty-nine patients (67%) in the critical group. Patients in the critical group were all mechanically ventilated. The critical group had significantly higher values of MFI, DBS and PVD in comparison to severe group (respectively, PaCO(2): 49 [44–45] vs 36 [33–37] mmHg; p<0,0001, MFI: 2.8 ± 0.2 vs 2.5 ± 0.3; p = 0.001, DBS: 12.7 ± 2.6 vs 10.8 ± 2.0 vessels mm(-2); p = 0.033, PVD: 12.5 ± 3.0 vs 10.1 ± 2.4 mm.mm(-2); p = 0.020). PPV, HI and TVD were similar between groups Correlation was found between microcirculatory parameters and PaCO(2) levels. CONCLUSION: Critical COVID-19 patients under mechanical ventilation seem to have higher red blood cell velocity than severe non-ventilated patients.","Abou-Arab, Osama; Beyls, Christophe; Khalipha, Abdelilah; Guilbart, Mathieu; Huette, Pierre; Malaquin, Stéphanie; Lecat, Benoit; Macq, Pierre-Yves; Roger, Pierre Alexandre; Haye, Guillaume; Bernasinski, Michaël; Besserve, Patricia; Soriot-Thomas, Sandrine; Jounieaux, Vincent; Dupont, Hervé; Mahjoub, Yazine",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33556081/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246636,583

It may lead to death if not treated promptly. RNASE 3 has been linked to Pf growth inhibition and its polymorphisms found associated with SM and cerebral malaria in African populations. This study aimed to assess the association of RNASE 3 polymorphisms with SM in an Indian population. RNASE 3 gene and flanking regions were amplified followed by direct DNA sequencing in 151 Indian patients who visited Wenlock District Government Hospital, Mangalore, Karnataka, India. Allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies were compared between patients with SM (n = 47) and uncomplicated malaria (UM; n = 104). Homozygous mutant genotype was only found for rs2233860 (+ 499G > C) polymorphism (< 1% frequency). No significant genetic associations were found for RNASE 3 polymorphism genotypes and alleles in Indian SM patients using the Fisher's exact test. C-G-G haplotype of rs2233859 (− 38C > A), rs2073342 (+ 371C > G) and rs2233860 (+ 499G > C) polymorphisms was correlated significantly with SM patients (OR = 3.03; p = 0.008) after Bonferroni correction. A haplotype of RNASE 3 gene was found associated with an increased risk of SM and confirming that RNASE 3 gene plays a role in susceptibility to SM.

656034,Adolescent Driver Testing During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-10-15,"AIMS: The adequate provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers has come under considerable scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate staff awareness of PPE guidance, perceptions of PPE measures, and concerns regarding PPE use while caring for COVID-19 patients. In addition, responses of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals (OHCPs) were compared. METHODS: The inclusion criteria were all staff working in clinical areas of the hospital. Staff were invited to take part using a link to an online questionnaire advertised by email, posters displayed in clinical areas, and social media. Questions grouped into the three key themes - staff awareness, perceptions, and concerns - were answered using a five-point Likert scale. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare results across all three groups of staff. RESULTS: Overall, 315 staff took part in our study. There was a high awareness of PPE guidance at 84.4%, but only 52.4% of staff reported adequate PPE provision. 67.9% were still keen to come to work, despite very high levels of anxiety relating to contracting COVID-19 despite wearing PPE. Doctors had significantly higher ratings for questions relating to PPE awareness compared to other staff groups, while nursing staff and OHCPs had significantly higher levels of anxiety compared to doctors in relation to PPE and contracting COVID-19 (p < 0.05 using a Kruskal-Wallis test). CONCLUSION: We believe four recommendations are key to improve PPE measures and decrease anxiety: 1) nominated ward/department PPE champions; 2) anonymized reporting for PPE concerns; 3) formal PPE education sessions; and 4) drop-in counselling sessions for staff. We hope the insight and recommendations from this study can improve the PPE situation and maintain the health and wellbeing of the clinical work force, in order to care for COVID-19 patients safely and effectively.","Key, Thomas; Mathai, Naveen J.; Venkatesan, Aakaash Sethuraman; Farnell, Damian; Mohanty, Khitish",Bone Jt Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33241223/; https://doi.org/10.1302/2633-1462.15.bjo-2020-0027.r1,583
656036,Role of community-based measures in adherence to self-protective behaviors during first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia,2021-02-07,"A critical event during the process of cell infection by a viral particle is attachment, which is driven by adhesive interactions and resisted by bending and tension. The biophysics of this process has been studied extensively, but the additional role of externally applied force or displacement has generally been neglected. In this work, we study the adhesive force-displacement response of viral particles against a cell membrane. We have built two models: one in which the viral particle is cylindrical (say, representative of a filamentous virus such as Ebola) and another in which it is spherical (such as SARS-CoV-2 and Zika). Our interest is in initial adhesion, in which case deformations are small, and the mathematical model for the system can be simplified considerably. The parameters that characterize the process combine into two dimensionless groups that represent normalized membrane bending stiffness and tension. In the limit where bending dominates, for sufficiently large values of normalized bending stiffness, there is no adhesion between viral particles and the cell membrane without applied force. (The zero external force contact width and pull-off force are both zero.) For large values of normalized membrane tension, the adhesion between virus and cell membrane is weak but stable. (The contact width at zero external force has a small value.) Our results for pull-off force and zero force contact width help to quantify conditions that could aid the development of therapies based on denying the virus entry into the cell by blocking its initial adhesion.

656402,Challenges in maintaining treatment services for people who use drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-05-06,"Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) could emit a large amount of bioaerosols containing pathogenic bacteria. Assessing the health risks of exposure to these bioaerosols by using quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is important to protect workers in WWTPs. However, the relative impacts of the stochastic input variables on the health risks determined in QMRA remain vague. Hence, this study performed a Monte Carlo simulation-based QMRA case study for workers exposing to S. aureus or E. coli bioaerosols and a sensitivity analysis in two WWTPs with various aeration modes. Results showed that when workers equipped without personal protective equipment (PPE) were exposed to S. aureus or E. coli bioaerosol in the two WWTPs, the annual probability of infection considerably exceeded the U.S. EPA benchmark (≤10E-4 pppy), and the disease burden did not satisfy the WHO benchmark (≤10E-6 DALYs pppy) (except exposure to E. coli bioaerosol for disease health risk burden). Nevertheless, the use of PPE effectively reduced the annual infection health risk to an acceptable level and converted the disease health risk burden to a highly acceptable level. Referring to the sensitivity analysis, the contribution of mechanical aeration modes to the variability of the health risks was absolutely dominated in the WWTPs. On the aeration mode that showed high exposure concentration, the three input exposure parameters (exposure time, aerosol ingestion rate, and breathing rate) had a great impact on health risks. The health risks were also prone to being highly influenced by the various choices of the dose–response model and related parameters. Current research systematically delivered new data and a novel perspective on the sensitivity analysis of QMRA. Then, management decisions could be executed by authorities on the basis of the results of this sensitivity analysis to reduce related occupational health risks of workers in WWTPs.","Chen, Yan-huan; Yan, Cheng; Yang, Ya-fei; Ma, Jia-xin",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142615; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720361441?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720361441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33038813/,583

The ADAPT consortium was formed to document and analyse the effects of the pandemic on medical education in the United Kingdom (UK), with the aim of capturing current and future snapshots of disruption to inform trends in the future performance of cohorts graduating during COVID-19. Methods Members of the consortium were recruited from various national medical student groups to ensure representation from medical schools across the UK. The groups involved were: Faculty of Medical Leadership and Management Medical Students Group (FMLM MSG); Neurology and Neurosurgery Interest Group (NANSIG); Doctors Association UK (DAUK); Royal Society of Medicine (RSM) Student Members Group and Medical Student Investigators Collaborative (MSICo.org). In total, 29 medical schools are represented by the consortium. Our members reported teaching postponement, examination status, alternative teaching provision, elective status and UK Foundation Programme Office (UKFPO) educational performance measure (EPM) ranking criteria relevant to their medical school during a data collection window (1st April 14:00 to 2nd April 23:59). Results All 29 medical schools began postponement of teaching between the 11th and 17th of March 2020. Changes to assessments were highly variable. Final year examinations had largely been completed before the onset of COVID-19. Of 226 exam sittings between Year 1 and Year 4 across 29 schools: 93 (41%) were cancelled completely; 14 (6%) had elements cancelled; 57 (25%) moved their exam sitting online. 23 exam sittings (10%) were postponed to a future date. 36% of cohorts with cancelled exams and 74% of cohorts with online exams were granted automatic progression to the next academic year. There exist 19 cohorts at 9 medical schools where all examinations (written and practical) were initially cancelled and automatic progression was granted. Conclusions The approaches taken by medical schools have differed substantially, though there has been universal disruption to teaching and assessments. The data presented in this study represent initial responses, which are likely to evolve over time. In particular, the status of future elective cancellations and UK Foundation Programme Office (UKFPO) educational performance measure (EPM) decile calculations remains unclear. The long-term implications of the heterogeneous disruption to medical education remains an area of active research. Differences in specialty recruitment and performance on future postgraduate examinations may be affected and will be a focus of future phases of the ADAPT Study.","Arora, A.; Solomou, G.; Bandyopadhyay, S.; Simons, J.; Osborne, A.; Georgiou, I.; Dominic, C.; Mahmood, S.; Badhrinarayanan, S.; Ahmed, S.

660071,Mental health problems and social media exposure during COVID-19 outbreak,2020-04-16,"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, and over 80 million cases and over 1.8 million deaths were reported in 2020. This highly contagious virus is spread primarily via respiratory droplets from face-to-face contact and contaminated surfaces as well as potential aerosol spread. Over half of transmissions occur from presymptomatic and asymptomatic carriers. Although several vaccines are currently available for emergency use, there are uncertainties regarding the duration of protection and the efficacy of preventing asymptomatic spread. Thus, personal protective health behaviour and measures against COVID-19 are still widely recommended after immunization. This study aimed to clarify the efficacy of these measures, and the results may provide valuable guidance to policymakers to educate the general public about how to reduce the individual-level risk of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This case-control study enrolled 24 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients from Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário (C.H.C.S.J.), which was the only hospital designated to manage COVID-19 patients in Macao SAR, China, and 1113 control participants who completed a 14-day mandatory quarantine in 12 designated hotels due to returning from high-risk countries between 17 March and 15 April 2020. A questionnaire was developed to extract demographic information, contact history, and personal health behaviour. RESULTS: Participants primarily came from the United Kingdom (33.2%), followed by the United States (10.5%) and Portugal (10.2%). Independent factors for COVID-19 infection were having physical contact with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients (adjusted OR, 12.108 [95% CI, 3.380–43.376], P < 0.005), participating in high-risk gathering activities (adjusted OR, 1.129 [95% CI, 1.048–1.216], P < 0.005), handwashing after outdoor activity (adjusted OR, 0.021 [95% CI, 0.003–0.134], P < 0.005), handwashing before touching the mouth and nose area (adjusted OR, 0.303 [95% CI, 0.114–0.808], P < 0.05), and wearing a mask whenever outdoors (adjusted OR, 0.307 [95% CI, 0.109–0.867], P < 0.05). The daily count of handwashing remained similar between groups. Only 31.6% of participants had a sufficient 20-s handwashing duration. CONCLUSIONS: Participating in high-risk gatherings, wearing a mask whenever outdoors, and practising hand hygiene at key times should be advocated to the public to mitigate COVID-19 infection.

However, the impact of COVID-19 infection on thrombus burden and the outcome of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has not been studied. Methods This was a retrospective, observational study that included all adult patients (>18 years) diagnosed with AMI with or without COVID-19 infection. Epidemiological, laboratory, clinical, interventional, and outcome data were extracted and the impact of COVID-19 on thrombus burden and the primary clinical composite endpoint of all-cause death during hospital admission or 30 days after discharge was studied. Results The study population included 336 patients, including 56 patients with COVID and AMI and 280 patients with AMI without COVID-19 infection. Chest pain was the most common symptom (84.8%) while one or more co-morbidity was present in 117 (34.8%) patients. Forty-eight patients in the AMI with COVID group had ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) while 256 patients in the AMI without COVID group had STEMI, eight patients in the AMI with COVID group had non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and 24 in the AMI without COVID group had NSTEMI. Patients with COVID-19 co-infection had a higher thrombus burden as compared to the patients without COVID-19 AMI group (p-value 0.008). The primary outcome in the form of all-cause mortality was seen in 13 (3.9%) patients, which was also more in the AMI with COVID group.

We aimed to evaluate and assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on management of diabetes and challenges faced by people with diabetes in India during and after the lockdown phase. Methods: A cross-sectional study based on an online questionnaire survey was designed. The questions collected socio-demographic details, medical and social history, and impact of the pandemic on medical and social life from 1582 participants. Linear regression was employed to evaluate association of different parameters with the change in glycemic levels. Results: The frequency of clinical visits during the COVID-19 pandemic were reduced in 87.28% of participants. 92.45% of participants were able to monitor their blood glucose levels (BGLs) in which 78.42% (49.35%, 20.91%, and 8.16%) participants experienced an increase in BGL (mild, moderate, and severe respectively).

Fusion proteins from a broad range of disparate viruses, such as paramyxovirus, HIV, ebola, and the influenza viruses share a variety of common features that are augmented by glycosylation. Each of these viruses contain multiple glycosylation sites that must be processed and modified by the host post-translational machinery to be fusogenically active. In most viruses, glycosylation plays a role in biogenesis, stability, antigenicity and infectivity. In bacteria, glycosylation events play an important role in the formation of flagellin and pili and are vitally important to adherence, attachment, infectivity and immune evasion.

662647,From in vitro research to real life studies: an extensive narrative review of the effects of balneotherapy on human immune response,2021-05-20,"INTRODUCTION: The rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic and the associated high morbidity and mortality led to sudden lock down, forcing the elderly and others in the high risk group into isolation. Elective health care services including diagnostics, therapeutics and elective surgical services were put on hold, leading to delays seriously affecting cancer and non-cancer related services. In spite of lessons learnt during the first wave, similar issues have persisted during the second wave, increasing the pressure on an already fragile infrastructure. METHODS: Information related to surgical patients admitted since lock down (March to August 2020) as an emergency was collected on a structured proforma and analysed. Data was gathered from prospectively kept patient admission lists and Electronic Discharge summaries. All the patients who were directly or indirectly affected with poor outcomes including delayed diagnosis and treatment were identified and included in the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 185 patients were admitted as an emergency during this period. Of these Eight patients admitted under surgical care were included in the study. Four out of eight patients were diagnosed with advanced cancer and the remainder presented with complications of benign pathologies. Of the four patients with advanced cancer, three patients had advanced colorectal and the fourth had advanced ovarian cancer. All four patients either presented late or had delayed access to investigations. Three out four patients with benign disease presented with complications due to cancellation of elective and semi urgent services. One patient who was COVID positive and presented with bowel perforation died after a prolonged hospital stay. CONCLUSION: There is definite evidence of unfavourable patient outcomes in non COVID patients as a result of the COVID pandemic. As COVID is unlikely to whither down in the very near future and highs and lows are expected, rapid and safe reintroduction of elective health care services affected by COVID is the call of the hour. In addition, more efforts should be directed towards increasing awareness amongst patients regarding the importance of reporting red flag symptoms and encouraging them to access health care services.","Khan, Rehan; Zaidi, Nisar; Chituku, Tsitsi; Rao, Milind",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367632/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080121005677; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080121005677?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102617,583

664076,What we learned in the past year in managing our COVID-19 patients in intensive care units?,2021-07-09,"Abstract In recent years, manipulation of particles by inertial microfluidics has attracted significant attention. However, most studies focused on inertial focusing of particles suspended within liquid phase, in which the ratio of the density of the particle to that of the medium is O(1). The investigation on manipulation of aerosol particles in an inertial microfluidics is very limited. In this study, we numerically investigate the aerosol particle's motion in a 3D straight microchannel with rectangular cross section by fully resolved simulation of the particle–air flow. The air flow is modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations. The particle's motions, including translation and rotation, are governed, respectively, by the Newton's second law and the Euler equations without using any approximation models for the lift and drag forces. The coupled mathematical model is numerically solved by combining immersed boundary with lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM). We find that the Reynolds number (Re), the particle's initial position, particle's density and diameter are the influential parameters in this process. The equilibrium positions and their stabilities of aerosols are different from those suspended in liquid.","Qian, Shizhi; Jiang, Maoqiang; Liu, Zhaohui",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674200120300845?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1674200120300845,583

Viruses that cause acute disease tend to bear characteristics that make them very contagious, as survival does not derive from chronicity of infection, but spread of disease throughout the herd. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is one of the most contagious viruses known. Upon infection of susceptible species, cloven-hoofed animals, the virus proliferates rapidly and causes a vesicular disease within 2–4 days. Disease symptoms resolve by 10 days to 2 weeks and in most cases, virus can no longer be detected. Periods of fever and viremia are usually brief, 1–3 days. In vivo control of virus infection and clearance of the virus during and following acute infection is of particular interest. The interaction of this virus with cells mediating the early, innate immune response has been analyzed in a number of recent studies. In most reports, the virus has a distinct inhibitory effect on the response of cells early in infection. Here we review these new data and discuss the dynamics of the interaction of virus with different cell types mediating the immune response to infection.","Toka, Felix N.; Golde, William T.",Immunol Lett,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2013.05.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165247813000679; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165247813000679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23727070/,583

The purpose of this study is to evaluate how this novel setting impacted on management of children with trauma, and the use and appropriateness of imaging studies in such patients at the pED. All imaging studies performed in patients with trauma at the pED of a tertiary children’s Hospital during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (between March and May 2020) were reviewed, in comparison with a control time interval (March to May 2019). In the pre-COVID control era, 669 imaging studies documented bone fractures in 145/568 children (25.5%). In the COVID-era, 79/177 (44.6%) pediatric patients showed bone fractures on 193 imaging studies. Comparative analysis shows a 71% decrease in imaging studies, and the proportion of negative imaging studies (with no evidence of bone fractures) dropped in 2020 by 19% compared to the 2019 control era (p < 0.001). The sharp decrease of negative studies suggests that the rate of appropriateness was higher during COVID-era, suggesting some attitude toward defensive medicine in the previous control year, as a result of some degree of imaging inappropriateness. The impact of a pandemic on emergency medicine may offer a unique opportunity to revisit diagnostic and therapeutic protocols in pediatrics.","Bottari, Giampiero; Stellacci, Giandomenico; Ferorelli, Davide; Dell’Erba, Alessandro; Aricò, Maurizio; Benevento, Marcello; Palladino, Giuseppe; Solarino, Biagio",Children (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/children8060463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34205841/,583

OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in pregnant patients, the effects of pregnancy on the course of COVID-19 disease, and the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy outcomes. DISCUSSION: The physiological and mechanical changes associated with pregnancy increase maternal susceptibility to infections and complicate intubation and mechanical ventilation. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant patients are cough and fever, although many infected individuals are asymptomatic. The majority of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 disease have a mild course of illness and will recover without needing to deliver, but the risk of critical illness and need for mechanical ventilation are increased compared to the general population. Risk factors for death and severe disease include obesity, diabetes, and maternal age > 40 years. Women in their third trimester have the highest risk for critical illness, intensive care unit admission, and need for mechanical ventilation. Adverse fetal outcomes of maternal COVID-19 infection include increased risk of miscarriage, prematurity, and fetal growth restriction. Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible but has not been conclusively proven. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is a potentially deadly infection, but data are limited concerning the pregnant population. Pregnant patients appear to present similarly to the general population, with fever and cough being the most reported symptoms in studies. Knowledge of these presentations and outcomes can assist clinicians caring for these patients.","Boushra, Marina N.; Koyfman, Alex; Long, Brit",Am J Emerg Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720309517; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720309517?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.10.055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33162266/,583

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We combined data from four countries to produce pooled age-banded case fatality rates, calculated the sex difference in survival and used data from four recent studies to convert case fatality rates into age/sex-stratified infection fatality rates (IFRs). We estimated the additional risk of death in cancer patients and in those receiving chemotherapy. We illustrate the impact of these by considering the impact on a national incident cancer cohort and analyse the risk–benefit in some clinical scenarios. RESULTS: We obtained data based on 412 985 cases and 41 854 deaths. The pooled estimate for IFR was 0.92%. IFRs for patients with cancer ranged from 0 to 29% and were higher in patients receiving chemotherapy (0.01–46%). The risk was significantly higher with age and in men compared with women. 37.5% of patients with a new diagnosis of cancer in 2018 had an IFR ≥5%. Survival benefits from adjuvant chemotherapy ranged from 5 to 10% in some common cancers, compared with the increased risk of death from COVID-19 of 0–3%. CONCLUSIONS: Older male patients are at a higher risk of death with COVID-19. Patients with cancer are also at a higher risk, as are those who have recently received chemotherapy. We provide well-founded estimates to allow patients and clinicians to better balance these risks and illustrate the wider impact in a national incident cohort.","Williams, M.; Mi, E.; Le Calvez, K.; Chen, J.; Pakzad-Shahabi, L.; Dadhania, S.; Wang, J.; Ho, A.; Rabinowicz, S.",Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0936655520304106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33218850/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clon.2020.10.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0936655520304106,583

The etiology is hypothesized to be related to thrombotic vasculopathy based on lesional biopsy specimen findings, but the pathogenesis of the vasculopathy is not completely understood. Here, we present a case of a retiform purpuric patch on the sacrum/buttocks in a hospitalized patient prior to subsequent diagnosis of COVID‐19 and an eventual fatal disease course. Two lesional biopsy specimens at different time points in the disease course revealed thrombotic vasculopathy, despite therapeutic anticoagulation. Detailed histopathologic evaluation using immunohistochemical markers suggest the etiology of the vasculopathy involves both persistent complement activation and platelet aggregation, which possibly promote ongoing thrombus formation. This case highlights that sacral/buttock retiform purpuric patches may be a presenting sign of infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 virus and may represent an ominous sign supporting a future severe disease course. In addition, biopsy specimen findings at separate time points demonstrate that cutaneous vasculopathy may persist despite adequate systemic anticoagulation, possibly due to the combination of persistent complement and platelet activation. Finally, occlusive thrombi in sacral/buttock retiform purpuric patches may contribute to future ulceration and significant cutaneous morbidity in patients who survive COVID‐19.","McBride, Jeffrey D.; Narang, Jatin; Simonds, Robert; Agrawal, Shruti; Rodriguez, E.

Abstraction methods, like the “distant reading” of corpora, are increasingly important for knowledge discovery in the sciences and humanities. We demonstrate how abstraction methods complement the metrics on which research reviews currently rely. We model cross-disciplinary topics of research publications and projects emerging at multiple levels of detail in the context of an institutional review of the Earth Research Institute (ERI) at the University of California at Santa Barbara. From these, we design science maps that reveal the latent thematic structure of ERI's interdisciplinary research and enable reviewers to “read” a body of research at multiple levels of detail. We find that our approach provides decision support and reveals trends that strengthen the institutional review process by exposing regions of thematic expertise, distributions and clusters of work, and the evolution of these aspects.","Lafia, Sara; Kuhn, Werner; Caylor, Kelly; Hemphill, Libby",Patterns (N Y),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33748794/,583
678121,Using social media data to assess the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in China,2021-04-20,"Misinformation is usually adjusted to fit distinct narratives and propagates rapidly through social networks. False beliefs, once adopted, are rarely corrected. Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, pandemic-deniers and people who oppose wearing face masks or quarantine have already been a substantial aspect of the development of the pandemic. With the vaccine for COVID-19, different anti-vaccine narratives are being created and are probably being adopted by large population groups with critical consequences. Assuming full adherence to vaccine administration, we use a diffusion model to analyse epidemic spreading and the impact of different vaccination strategies, measured with the average years of life lost, in three network topologies (a proximity, a scale-free and a small-world network). Then, using a similar diffusion model, we consider the spread of anti-vaccine views in the network, which are adopted based on a persuasiveness parameter of anti-vaccine views. Results show that even if anti-vaccine narratives have a small persuasiveness, a large part of the population will be rapidly exposed to them. Assuming that all individuals are equally likely to adopt anti-vaccine views after being exposed, more central nodes in the network, which are more exposed to these views, are more likely to adopt them. Comparing years of life lost, anti-vaccine views could have a significant cost not only on those who share them, since the core social benefits of a limited vaccination strategy (reduction of susceptible hosts, network disruptions and slowing the spread of the disease) are substantially shortened.","Prieto Curiel, Rafael; González Ramírez, Humberto",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758218/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85555-1,583

Regarding the important role of nutrition on the immunity, the present review article aimed to outline nutritional support of DM during the outbreak of COVID-19 with a mechanistic insight. METHODS: Searches were performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases from 2000 until December 2020 using the following keywords. All relevant clinical and experimental studies published in English were included. RESULTS: Evidences revealed that hyperglycemia is a significant predictor of some viral infections including COVID-19 which can exacerbate the complications of DM. According to the literature review, adequate intake of dietary protein, fiber, essential fatty acids and some micronutrients especially vitamins D, C, B12, folate, zinc and selenium has beneficial effects on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in diabetic patients through modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses or direct effects on virus enzymes or the rate of cell entrance. CONCLUSIONS: It is well understood that malnutrition may increase susceptibility to viral infections and disease progression. Therefore, considering nutritional status of diabetic patients and reasonable supplementation of the above mentioned nutrients can ameliorate the symptoms of COVID-19 in DM. However, further well-designed clinical trials are needed to determine their therapeutic dose.","Mahluji, Sepideh; Jalili, Mahsa; Ostadrahimi, Alireza; Hallajzadeh, Jamal; Ebrahimzadeh-Attari, Vahideh; Saghafi-Asl, Maryam",J Diabetes Metab Disord,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40200-021-00784-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842400/,583
679430,"Individual, Relational, and Sociocultural Determinants of Sexual Function and Sexual Satisfaction in Ecuador",2021-03-12,"Viruses, viroids and prions are the smallest infectious biological entities that depend on their host for replication. The number of pathogenic viruses is considerably large and their impact in human global health is well documented. Currently, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has classified ∼4379 virus species while the National Center for Biotechnology Information Viral Genomes Resource (NCBI-VGR) database has mapped 617 705 proteins to eight large taxonomic groups. Despite these efforts, an automated approach for mapping the ICTV master list and its officially accepted virus naming to the NCBI-VGR’s taxonomical classification is not available. Due to metagenomic sequencing, it is likely that the discovery and naming of new viral species will increase by at least ten fold. Unfortunately, existing viral databases are not adequately prepared to scale, maintain and annotate automatically ultra-high throughput sequences and place this information into specific taxonomic categories. ORION-VIRCAT is a scalable and interoperable object-relational database designed to serve as a resource for the integration and verification of taxonomical classifications generated by the ICTV and NCBI-VGR. The current release (v1.0) of ORION-VIRCAT is implemented in PostgreSQL and it has been extended to ORACLE, MySQL and SyBase. ORION-VIRCAT automatically mapped and joined 617 705 entries from the NCBI-VGR to the viral naming of the ICTV. This detailed analysis revealed that 399 095 entries from the NCBI-VGR can be mapped to the ICTV classification and that one Order, 10 families, 35 genera and 503 species listed in the ICTV disagree with the the NCBI-VGR classification schema.

This study aimed to identify knowledge, attitudes, experiences, and practices regarding medical nutrition therapy and barriers and facilitators to medical nutrition therapy access for individuals with CKD stages G1-G5 from the perspective of patients and providers. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study composed of anonymous surveys. SETTING & POPULATION: Adults with CKD stages G1-G5 and medical providers and registered dietitian nutritionists who regularly see patients with CKD stages G1-G5 were recruited by email using National Kidney Foundation and Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics databases and through the National Kidney Foundation 2019 Spring Clinical Meetings mobile app. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Descriptive analyses and Fisher exact tests were conducted with Stata SE 16. RESULTS: Respondents included 348 patients, 66 registered dietitian nutritionists, and 30 medical providers. In general, patients and providers had positive perceptions of medical nutrition therapy and its potential to slow CKD progression and manage complications, and most patients reported interest in a medical nutrition therapy referral. However, there were feasibility concerns related to cost to the patient, lack of insurance coverage, and lack of renal registered dietitian nutritionists. There was low awareness of Medicare no-cost share coverage for medical nutrition therapy across patients and providers. About half the practices did not bill for medical nutrition therapy and those that did reported issues with being paid and low reimbursement rates. LIMITATIONS: Results may not be generalizable due to the small number of respondents and the potential for self-selection, nonresponse, and social desirability bias. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with CKD stages G1-G5 are interested in medical nutrition therapy and confident that it can help with disease management, but there are feasibility concerns related to cost to the patient, insurance coverage, and reimbursement. There are significant opportunities to design and test interventions to facilitate medical nutrition therapy access for patients with CKD stages G1-G5.","Jimenez, Elizabeth Yakes; Kelley, Kathryn; Schofield, Marsha; Brommage, Deborah; Steiber, Alison; Abram, Jenica K.; Kramer, Holly",Kidney Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33604538/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xkme.2020.09.005,583
680971,"Factors associated with preventive behaviors, anxiety among healthcare workers and response preparedness against COVID-19 outbreak: A one health approach",2020-12-04,"PURPOSE: Lens adapted smartphones are being used regularly instead of ophthalmoscopes. The most common causes of preventable blindness in the world, which are glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy, can develop asymptomatic changes to the optic nerve head (ONH) especially in the developing world where there is a dire shortage of ophthalmologists but ubiquitous mobile phones. We developed a proof-of-concept ONH biometric (application [APP]) to use as a routine biometric on a mobile phone. The unique blood vessel pattern is verified if it maps on to a previously enrolled image. METHODS: The iKey APP platform comprises three deep neural networks (DNNs) developed from anonymous ONH images: the graticule blood vessel (GBV) and the blood vessel specific feature (BVSF) DNNs were trained on unique blood vessel vectors. A non-feature specific (NFS) baseline ResNet50 DNN was trained for comparison. RESULTS: Verification reached an accuracy of 97.06% with BVSF, 87.24% with GBV and 79.8% using NFS. CONCLUSIONS: A new ONH biometric was developed with a hybrid platform of ONH algorithms for use as a verification biometric on a smartphone. Failure to verify will alert the user to possible changes to the image, so that silent changes may be observed before sight threatening disease progresses. The APP retains a history of all ONH images. Future longitudinal analysis will explore the impact of ONH changes to the iKey biometric platform. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Phones with iKey will host ONH images for biometric protection of both health and financial data. The ONH may be used for automatic screening by new disease detection DNNs.","Coleman, Kate; Coleman, Jason; Franco-Penya, Hector; Hamroush, Fatima; Murtagh, Patrick; Fitzpatrick, Patricia; Aiken, Mary; Combes, Andrew; Keegan, David",Transl Vis Sci Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196679/; https://doi.org/10.1167/tvst.10.8.1,583
681735,The perspective of undergraduate dental students on web-based learning in pediatric dentistry during the COVID-19 pandemic: a Korean multicenter cross-sectional survey,2021-09-25,"OBJECTIVE: Since December 2019, an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to almost all parts of China. This was followed by prevention programs recommending Chinese medicine (CM) for the prevention. In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed ancient classics and human studies. METHODS: Historical records on prevention and treatment of infections in CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention programs issued by health authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were retrieved from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020. Research evidence included data from clinical trials, cohort or other population studies using CM for preventing contagious respiratory virus diseases. RESULTS: The use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases was traced back to ancient Chinese practice cited in Huangdi’s Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) where preventive effects were recorded. There were 3 studies using CM for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 influenza. None of the participants who took CM contracted SARS in the 3 studies. The infection rate of H1N1 influenza in the CM group was significantly lower than the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24–0.52; n=4). For prevention of COVID-19, 23 provinces in China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness. The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao). CONCLUSIONS: Based on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population. Prospective, rigorous population studies are warranted to confirm the potential preventive effect of CM.

However, structural and ultrastructural evidence on how the SARS-CoV-2 infection progresses in the frozen-hydrated native cellular context is scarce, and there is a lack of comprehensive knowledge on the SARS-CoV-2 replicative cycle. To correlate the cytopathic events induced by SARS-CoV-2 with virus replication process under the frozen-hydrated condition, here we established a unique multi-modal, multi-scale cryo-correlative platform to image SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero cells. This platform combines serial cryoFIB/SEM volume imaging and soft X-ray cryo-tomography with cell lamellae-based cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) and subtomogram averaging. The results place critical SARS-CoV-2 structural events â€“ e.g. viral RNA transport portals on double membrane vesicles, virus assembly and budding intermediates, virus egress pathways, and native virus spike structures from intracellular assembled and extracellular released virus - in the context of whole-cell images. The latter revealed numerous heterogeneous cytoplasmic vesicles, the formation of membrane tunnels through which viruses exit, and the drastic cytoplasm invasion into the nucleus.

Initial workup was remarkable for refractory anemia, moderate schistocytes on peripheral smear and lab work suggestive of a hemolytic anemia. Due to concern for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), she subsequently underwent several rounds of plasma exchange without significant improvement. Secondary to progressive renal failure, patient eventually had a renal biopsy with findings remarkable for thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Simultaneously, patient was also diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. After a few weeks of supportive care, she was stable for discharge. Unfortunately, she did become dialysis dependent. Prior to hospital admission, she was being treated for metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and had received chemotherapy with gemcitabine. Her last chemotherapy session was approximately 3 weeks prior to her first hospitalization. Furthermore, although her hemolytic work did suggest TMA, it was not consistent with the diagnosis of TTP. She was transferred to a tertiary care center where hemolytic labs were trended, and supportive care was maximized. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to further investigate the pathophysiology of TMA in patients with active malignancies and COVID-19 infections.

This ban, which includes family members, has been criticized for being unfair, unhealthy, and unsafe. Against this backdrop, I examine the roles family play in residents’ daily lives and care routines. I argue that classifying family as “visitors” rather than essential care partners overlooks their critical contributions and stems from taken-for-granted assumption about gender, families, and care work, and I demonstrate why families are more than visitors. Policies that ban family visits also reflect a narrow understanding of health that focuses on mitigating infection risk, but neglects overall health and well-being. This policy further stems from a limited comprehension of care relations. Research shows that banning family visits has negative consequences for residents, but also families themselves, and direct care workers. I argue that identifying ways to better understand and support family involvement is essential and demonstrate the utility of the Convoys of Care model for guiding the reconceptualization of family in long-term care research, policy, and practice during and beyond the pandemic.","Kemp, Candace L",Gerontologist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33295960/; https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaa161,583

In the infected animals, viral variants arose that harbored mutations in the spike (S) protein, the target of neutralizing antibodies, and these variants were transmitted back to humans. This raised concerns that mink might become a constant source of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with an increased threat to human health and resulted in mass culling of mink. Here, we report that mutations frequently found in the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 from mink are mostly compatible with efficient entry into human cells and its inhibition by soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In contrast, mutation Y453F reduces neutralization by an antibody with emergency use authorization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapy and sera/plasma from COVID-19 patients.

687364,Job loss and lower healthcare utilisation due to COVID-19 among older adults across 27 European countries,2021-05-12,"COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 pathogen has been a catastrophic pandemic outbreak all over the world, with exponential increasing of confirmed cases and, unfortunately, deaths. In this work we propose an AI-powered pipeline, based on the deep-learning paradigm, for automated COVID-19 detection and lesion categorization from CT scans. We first propose a new segmentation module aimed at automatically identifying lung parenchyma and lobes. Next, we combine the segmentation network with classification networks for COVID-19 identification and lesion categorization. We compare the model’s classification results with those obtained by three expert radiologists on a dataset of 166 CT scans. Results showed a sensitivity of 90.3% and a specificity of 93.5% for COVID-19 detection, at least on par with those yielded by the expert radiologists, and an average lesion categorization accuracy of about 84%. Moreover, a significant role is played by prior lung and lobe segmentation, that allowed us to enhance classification performance by over 6 percent points. The interpretation of the trained AI models reveals that the most significant areas for supporting the decision on COVID-19 identification are consistent with the lesions clinically associated to the virus, i.e., crazy paving, consolidation and ground glass. This means that the artificial models are able to discriminate a positive patient from a negative one (both controls and patients with interstitial pneumonia tested negative to COVID) by evaluating the presence of those lesions into CT scans. Finally, the AI models are integrated into a user-friendly GUI to support AI explainability for radiologists, which is publicly available at http://perceivelab.com/covid-ai. The whole AI system is unique since, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first AI-based software, publicly available, that attempts to explain to radiologists what information is used by AI methods for making decisions and that proactively involves them in the decision loop to further improve the COVID-19 understanding.","Pennisi, Matteo; Kavasidis, Isaak; Spampinato, Concetto; Schinina, Vincenzo; Palazzo, Simone; Salanitri, Federica Proietto; Bellitto, Giovanni; Rundo, Francesco; Aldinucci, Marco; Cristofaro, Massimo; Campioni, Paolo; Pianura, Elisa; Di Stefano, Federica; Petrone, Ada; Albarello, Fabrizio; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Cuzzocrea, Salvatore; Conoci, Sabrina",Artif Intell Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34412837/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S093336572100107X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2021.102114; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S093336572100107X,583
688101,Lessons Learned from 9/11: Mental Health Perspectives on the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-04-15,"BACKGROUND: The aim was to describe the organisational changes in French EDs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic with regard to architectural constraints and compare with the recommendations of the various bodies concerning the structural adjustments to be made in this context. METHODS: As part of this cross-sectional study, all heads of emergency services or their deputies were contacted to complete an electronic survey. This was a standardised online questionnaire consisting of four parts: characteristics of the responding centre, creation of the COVID-19 zone and activation of the hospital’s emergency operations plan, flow and circulation of patients and, finally, staff management. Each centre was classified according to its workload related to COVID-19 and its size (university hospital centre, high-capacity hospital centre and low-capacity hospital centre). The main endpoint was the frequency of implementation of international guidelines for ED organisation. RESULTS: Between 11 May and 20 June 2020, 57 French EDs completed the online questionnaire and were included in the analysis. Twenty-eight EDs were able to separate patient flows into two zones: high and low viral density (n=28/57, 49.1%). Of the centres included, 52.6% set up a specific triage area for patients with suspected COVID-19 (n=30/57). Whereas, in 15 of the EDs (26.3%), the architecture made it impossible to increase the surface area of the ED. CONCLUSION: All EDs have adapted, but many of the changes recommended for the organisation of ED could not be implemented. ED architecture constrains adaptive capacities in the context of COVID-19.","Douillet, Delphine; Saloux, Thomas; Ravon, Pauline; Morin, François; Moumneh, Thomas; Carneiro, Bruno; Roy, Pierre Marie; Savary, Dominique",Emerg Med J,https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2020-211012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34429371/,583
689119,Potential changes to the hikikimori phenomenon in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic,2020-07-11,"Two large wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), covering around 2.7 million inhabitants, which represents around 85% of the metropolitan area of Barcelona, were sampled before, during, and after the implementation of a complete lockdown. Five one-step reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays, targeting the polymerase (IP2 and IP4), the envelope (E), and the nucleoprotein (N1 and N2) genome regions, were employed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection in 24-h composite wastewater samples concentrated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a sewage sample collected 41 days ahead of the declaration of the first COVID-19 case. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies in wastewater evidenced the validity of water-based epidemiology (WBE) to anticipate COVID-19 outbreaks, to evaluate the impact of control measures, and even to estimate the burden of shedders, including presymptomatic, asymptomatic, symptomatic, and undiagnosed cases. For the latter objective, a model was applied for the estimation of the total number of shedders, evidencing a high proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals. In this way, an infection prevalence of 2.0 to 6.5% was figured. On the other hand, proportions of around 0.12% and 0.09% of the total population were determined to be required for positive detection in the two WWTPs. At the end of the lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 RNA apparently disappeared in the WWTPs but could still be detected in grab samples from four urban sewers. Sewer monitoring allowed for location of specific hot spots of COVID-19, enabling the rapid adoption of appropriate mitigation measures. IMPORTANCE Water-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable early warning tool for tracking the circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among the population, including not only symptomatic patients but also asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and misdiagnosed carriers, which represent a high proportion of the infected population. In the specific case of Barcelona, wastewater surveillance anticipated by several weeks not only the original COVID-19 pandemic wave but also the onset of the second wave. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in wastewater evidenced the efficacy of the adopted lockdown measures on the circulation of the virus. Health authorities profited from WBE to complement other inputs and adopt rapid and adequate measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. For example, sentinel surveillance of specific sewers helped to locate COVID-19 hot spots and to conduct massive numbers of RT-PCR tests among the population.","Chavarria-Miró, Gemma; Anfruns-Estrada, Eduard; Martínez-Velázquez, Adán; Vázquez-Portero, Mario; Guix, Susana; Paraira, Miquel; Galofré, Belén; Sánchez, Gloria; Pintó, Rosa M.; Bosch, Albert",Appl Environ Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.02750-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33483313/,583
690062,The Urgent and Growing Needs of Youths Experiencing Homelessness During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-09-17,"PURPOSE: While most influenza patients have a self-limited respiratory illness, 5–10% of hospitalized patients develop severe disease requiring ICU admission. The aim of this study was to identify influenza-specific factors associated with ICU admission and mortality. Furthermore, influenza-specific pulmonary bacterial, fungal and viral co-infections were investigated. METHODS: 199 influenza patients, admitted to two academic hospitals in the Netherlands between 01-10-2015 and 01-04-2016 were investigated of which 45/199 were admitted to the ICU. RESULTS: A history of Obstructive/Central Sleep Apnea Syndrome, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, influenza type A, BMI > 30, the development of renal failure and bacterial and fungal co-infections, were observed more frequently in patients who were admitted to the ICU, compared with patients at the normal ward. Co-infections were evident in 55.6% of ICU-admitted patients, compared with 20.1% of patients at the normal ward, mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Non-survivors suffered from diabetes mellitus and (pre-existent) renal failure more often. CONCLUSIONS: The current study indicates that a history of OSAS/CSAS, myocardial infarction and BMI > 30 might be related to ICU admission in influenza patients. Second, ICU patients develop more pulmonary co-infections. Last, (pre-existent) renal failure and diabetes mellitus are more often observed in non-survivors.","Beumer, M.C.; Koch, R.M.; van Beuningen, D.; OudeLashof, A.M.; van de Veerdonk, F.L.; Kolwijck, E.; van der Hoeven, J.G.; Bergmans, D.C.; Hoedemaekers, C.W.E.",J Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30481669/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0883944118300327; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883944118300327; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2018.11.013,583
690601,Psychological Distress Among a Tunisian Community Sample During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Correlations with Religious Coping,2021-03-27,"Isotretinoin is a highly efficacious medication for the treatment of acne vulgaris; however, its prescription is subject to the strict requirements of the iPLEDGE restricted distribution program. These requirements have placed significant financial, time, and logistical burdens on patients taking the medication. The stay-at-home ordinances enacted by many states during the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic have accelerated previous trends toward utilization of telehealth and decreased laboratory monitoring in the care of patients on isotretinoin. Recent changes to the iPLEDGE program allowing use of at-home pregnancy tests to meet monthly pregnancy test requirements during the pandemic have increased availability of testing options for patients of child-bearing potential on isotretinoin. The change to use of at-home pregnancy test monitoring as well as long-term trends toward increasing access to isotretinoin through the use of telehealth are discussed.","Kane, Sierra; Admani, Shehla",J Dermatol Nurses Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191969/; https://doi.org/10.1097/jdn.0000000000000595,583
