Identification of patients at risk for infection is based on each patient's type of oral microbial colonization and the presence of latent viral infections. Systemic and local resistance to infection will be decisive, and in many patients the risk can be estimated from the expected myelosuppressive effect of anticancer treatment. Diagnosis of infection is often based on clinical findings together with the results of microbiological investigations. Biopsies could be useful, but can seldom be obtained. Blood samples are mandatory for isolation of microorganisms involved in systemic infections in myelosuppressed patients. Prevention of infection requires both local and systemic measures. Elimination of the risk of a breach in the first line of defence is urgent, and the maintenance of mucosal integrity is important. Monitoring microbial colonization is common, as is the institution of antiviral prophylaxis in patients with increased anti-HSV IgG (ELISA >10 000). Antifungal prophylaxis, to avoid colonization and superinfection, should be instituted in patients with low neutrophil counts. Gastrointestinal prophylaxis with quinolones is also commonly used in these patient groups. Treatment of oral infections in cancer patients should include systemic antimicrobial agents in most cases. Special attention should be directed to oral infections in neutropenic (<0.5×l0(9)/l) patients in whom oral microorganisms are the leading cause of bacteraemia. Invasive fungal infections of the oral cavity can be associated with systemic fungal infection and are indications for the use of liposomal amphotericin B.","Heimdahl, Anders",Support Care Cancer,516,22

Although originally proposed to have intracellular and extracellular functions, upon the discovery that perforin, in combination with GrB, could induce apoptosis, other potential functions for this protease were, for the most part, disregarded. As there are 5 granzymes in humans and 11 granzymes in mice, many studies used perforin knockout mice as an initial screen to evaluate the role of granzymes in disease. However, in recent years, emerging clinical and biochemical evidence has shown that the latter approach may have overlooked a critical perforin-independent, pathogenic role for these proteases in disease. This review focuses on GrB, the most characterized of the granzyme family, in disease. Long known to be a pro-apoptotic protease expressed by cytotoxic lymphocytes and natural killer cells, it is now accepted that GrB can be expressed in other cell types of immune and nonimmune origin. To the latter, an emerging immune-independent role for GrB has been forwarded due to recent discoveries that GrB may be expressed in nonimmune cells such as smooth muscle cells, keratinocytes, and chondrocytes in certain disease states. Given that GrB retains its activity in the blood, can cleave extracellular matrix, and its levels are often elevated in chronic inflammatory diseases, this protease may be an important contributor to certain pathologies. The implications of sustained elevations of intracellular and extracellular GrB in chronic vascular, dermatological, and neurological diseases, among others, are developing. This review examines, for the first time, the multiple roles of GrB in disease pathogenesis.","Boivin, Wendy Anne; Cooper, Dawn Michelle; Hiebert, Paul Ryan; Granville, David James",Lab Invest,516,19

We evaluated factors associated with failed de-cannulations to develop a prediction model that could be easily be used at the time of weaning from MV. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort of 346 tracheostomised patients managed by a standardized de-cannulation program, multivariable logistic regression analysis identified variables that were independently associated with failed de-cannulation. Based on the logistic regression analysis, the new predictive scoring system for successful de-cannulation, referred to as the DECAN score, was developed and then internally validated. RESULTS: The model included age > 67 years, body mass index < 22 kg/m(2), underlying malignancy, non-respiratory causes of mechanical ventilation (MV), presence of neurologic disease, vasopressor requirement, and presence of post-tracheostomy pneumonia, presence of delirium. The DECAN score was associated with good calibration (goodness-of-fit, 0.6477) and discrimination outcomes (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.890, 95% CI 0.853–0.921). The optimal cut-off point for the DECAN score for the prediction of the successful de-cannulation was ≤ 5 points, and was associated with the specificities of 84.6% (95% CI 77.7–90.0) and sensitivities of 80.2% (95% CI 73.9–85.5). CONCLUSIONS: The DECAN score for tracheostomised patients who are successfully weaned from prolonged MV can be computed at the time of weaning to assess the probability of de-cannulation based on readily available variables.","Park, Chul; Ko, Ryoung-Eun; Jung, Jinhee; Na, Soo Jin; Jeon, Kyeongman",Respir Res,516,22

However, transplanted stem cells show a high death percentage, creating challenges to successful transplantation and prognosis. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the mechanisms underlying stem cell death, such as apoptotic cascade activation, excessive autophagy, inflammatory response, reactive oxygen species, excitotoxicity, and ischemia/hypoxia. Targeting the molecular pathways involved may be an efficient strategy to enhance stem cell viability and maximize transplantation success. Notably, a more complex network of cell death receives more attention than one crucial pathway in determining stem cell fate, highlighting the challenges in exploring mechanisms and therapeutic targets. In this review, we focus on programmed cell death in transplanted stem cells. We also discuss some promising strategies and challenges in promoting survival for further study.","Hu, Xi-Min; Zhang, Qi; Zhou, Rui-Xin; Wu, Yan-Lin; Li, Zhi-Xin; Zhang, Dan-Yi; Yang, Yi-Chao; Yang, Rong-Hua; Hu, Yong-Jun; Xiong, Kun",World J Stem Cells,516,22

The interferon-inducible, antiviral PKR signaling pathway positively regulates autophagy, and both mammalian and plant autophagy genes restrict viral replication and protect against virus-induced cell death. Given this role of autophagy in innate immunity, it is not surprising that viruses have evolved numerous strategies to inhibit host autophagy. Different viral gene products can either modulate autophagy regulatory signals or directly interact with components of the autophagy execution machinery. Moreover, certain RNA viruses have managed to “co-apt” the autophagy pathway, selectively utilizing certain components of the dynamic membrane rearrangement system to promote their own replication inside the host cytoplasm. In addition to this newly emerging role of autophagy in innate immunity, autophagy plays an important role in many other fundamental biological processes, including tissue homeostasis, differentiation and development, cell growth control, and the prevention of aging. Accordingly, the inhibition of host autophagy by viral gene products has important implications not only for understanding mechanisms of immune evasion, but also for understanding novel mechanisms of viral pathogenesis. It will be interesting to dissect the role of viral inhibition of autophagy in acute, persistent, and latent viral replication, as well as in the pathogenesis of cancer and other medical diseases.","Seay, Montrell; Dinesh-Kumar, Savithramma; Levine, Beth",Modulation of Host Gene Expression and Innate Immunity by Viruses,516,19

Effective laboratory markers and prognostic indicators are needed to predict the clinical progression of the disease. AIMS The purpose of this study was to investigate IL6, IL8/CXCL8, and IP10/CXCL10, and biochemical parameters associated with SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 infections and their significance on prognosis in healthy volunteers and mild-moderate and severe COVID 19 patients. METHODS Healthy volunteers (n=30), and patients with mild-moderate (n=30) and severe (n=30) COVID-19 patients were included in the study. IL-6, IL-8 and IP-10 levels and biochemical parameters were assessed among the groups and their correlations with each other were subjected to statistical analysis. RESULTS Blood serum IL-6, IL-8 and IP-10 levels were the highest in the severe patient group (p=0.001), and also higher in the mild-moderate group as compared to the healthy volunteers (p=0.001). Statistically significant positive correlations were identified between serum IL-8 and IL-6 levels (p=0.001 r=0.660), between serum IP-10 and IL-6 (p=0.001 r =0.599) and between serum IP-10 and IL-8 (p=0.001 r=0.729).

Nevertheless, each year 800,000 people die of suicide in the world. While there is evidence indicating that suicide rates de-crease during times of crises, they are expected to increase once the immediate crisis has passed. The COVID-19 pandemic affects risk and pro-tective factors for suicide at each level of the socio-ecological model. Economic downturn, augmented barriers to accessing health care, increased access to suicidal means, inappropriate media reporting at the societal level; deprioritization of mental health and preventive activities at the community level; interpersonal conflicts, neglect and violence at the relationship level; unemployment, poverty, loneliness and hopelessness at the individual level: all these variables contribute to an increase of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, harmful use of alcohol, substance abuse, and ultimately suicide risk. Suicide should be prevented by strengthening universal strategies directed to the entire population, including mitigation of unemployment, poverty and inequalities; prioritization of access to mental health care; responsible media reporting, with information about available support; prevention of increased alcohol intake; and restriction of access to lethal means of suicide. Selective interventions should continue to target known vulnerable groups who are socio-economically disadvantaged, but also new ones such as first responders and health care staff, and the bereaved by COVID-19 who have been deprived of the final contact with loved ones and funerals. Indicated preventive strategies targeting individuals who display suicidal behaviour should focus on available pharmacological and psychological treatments of mental disorders, ensuring proper follow-up and chain of care by increased use of telemedicine and other digital means. The scientific community, health care professionals, politicians and decision-makers will find in this paper a systematic description of the effects of the pandemic on suicide risk at the society, community, family and individual levels, and an overview of how evidence-based suicide preventive interventions should be adapted.

We determined the enzymic activity of each allele across a range of temperatures in vitro The F and S alleles have higher activity and are less sensitive to high temperatures than the M allele, which loses activity after incubation at temperatures found in the thorax of foraging bees in hot climates. Next, we predicted the protein structure of each allele and used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate their molecular flexibility. The M allele is more flexible than the S and F alleles at 50°C, suggesting a plausible explanation for M's loss of activity at high temperatures, and has the greatest structural flexibility at 15°C, suggesting that it can retain some enzyme activity at cooler temperatures. MM bees recovered from two hours of cold narcosis significantly better than all other genotypes.

NT-proBNP was repeatedly demonstrated to be a strong and independent predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with HF. Only few - and conflicting - data are available on the efficacy of serial measurement of NT-proBNP as a tool for treatment monitoring in HF. These data are limited to the outpatient setting. Currently, no data are available on the effects of this approach in patients hospitalized for acute decompensated HF. The goal of this study is to explore whether the availability of serial NT-proBNP measurements may influence treatment decisions in patients with acute decompensated HF, and whether this leads to more rapid dose adjustments of prognostically beneficial medical therapies and earlier hospital discharge. In the intervention group, serial measurements of NT-proBNP every second business day are performed and made available to the treating physician, while no serial measurements are available in control group.

The possibility of vaccine interference after simultaneous combined vaccination with Arkansas (Ark) and Massachusetts (Mass)-type vaccines was evaluated in an effort to explain the high prevalence of Ark-type infectious bronchitis virus in vaccinated chickens. Chickens ocularly vaccinated with combinations of Ark and Mass showed predominance of Mass vaccine virus before 9 days post-vaccination (DPV) in tears. Even when Mass and Ark vaccines were inoculated into separate eyes, Mass vaccine virus was able to outcompete Ark vaccine virus. Although Mass vaccine virus apparently had a replication advantage over Ark vaccine in ocular tissues, Ark vaccine virus appeared to have an advantage in spreading to and/or replicating in the trachea. When chickens vaccinated with Ark or Mass vaccine were housed together, Mass vaccine virus was able to spread to Ark-vaccinated chickens, but the Ark vaccine was not detected in Mass-vaccinated chickens. Only Mass vaccine was detected in tears of sentinel birds introduced into groups receiving both vaccines. Furthermore, Ark vaccine virus RNA was not detectable until 10 DPV in most tear samples from chickens vaccinated with both Ark and Mass vaccines at varying Ark vaccine doses, while high concentrations of Mass virus RNA were detectable at 3-7 DPV. In contrast, Ark vaccine virus replicated effectively early after vaccination in chickens vaccinated with Ark vaccine alone. The different replication dynamics of Ark and Mass viruses in chickens vaccinated with combined vaccines did not result in reduced protection against Ark challenge at 21 DPV. Further studies are needed to clarify if the viral interference detected determines differences in protection against challenge at other time points after vaccination.","Ndegwa, Eunice N; Bartlett, Samantha N; Toro, Haroldo; Joiner, Kellye S; van Santen, Vicky L",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,516,6

We developed a thin-walled ETT cuff made of Lycra polyurethane. METHODS In vitro, we tested 6 of each of the new prototype Lycra cuff, the Mallinkrodt Hi-Lo ETT (polyvinyl chloride cuff), and the Kimberly-Clark Microcuff ETT (polyurethane cuff), for leakage, in an acrylic mock trachea (inner diameter 20-mm), with a cuff inflation pressure of 20 cm H(2)O. We poured 15 mL of methylene-blue colored water into the acrylic tube above the cuff and observed for leakage for 24 hours. RESULTS The Lycra cuffs had no folds upon inflation in the mock trachea and completely prevented fluid leakage for 24 hours (P < .001 vs the Hi-Lo and the Microcuff). The average leakage past the Hi-Lo was 1,182 ± 1,321 mL/h. The average leakage past the Microcuff was 1.2 ± 0.4 mL/h (P < .001 vs the Hi-Lo).

Although subcuticular skin closure techniques offer an aesthetic advantage over conventional skin stapling, no measurable differences have been reported. Furthermore, newer barbed sutures, such as the V-Loc absorbable suture (Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts), theoretically distribute tension evenly through the wound and help decrease knot-related complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether wound complication rates were (1) lower in V-Loc closure cases as theoretically suggested, (2) lower for subcuticular closure vs staples, and (3) significantly different for knee and hip joint reconstruction.A retrospective chart review was conducted of 278 consecutive cases of primary joint reconstruction performed by a single surgeon (L.P.). The study group comprised 106 men and 161 women. Average patient age at surgery was 63 years (range, 18-92 years), and average body mass index of the cohort was 33.7 kg/m(2) (range, 25-51 kg/m(2)). Skin was closed via staple gun or subcuticular stitch (3-0 Biosyn [Covidien] vs V-Loc). Seven (3.9%) wound complications occurred in 181 cases closed with staples. Four (7.8%) wound complications occurred in 51 cases closed via subcuticular Biosyn suture. Six (13.0%) wound complications occurred in 46 cases closed with V-Loc suture. The staple group had a lower rate of complications when compared with the suture group as a whole (P=.033) and when compared specifically with the V-Loc suture group (P=.017).","Patel, Ronak M; Cayo, Max; Patel, Arpan; Albarillo, Marie; Puri, Lalit",Orthopedics,516,16

Although mask wearing is a convenient way to reduce the spread of disease, it is important to know how the mask affects our communication via facial expression. For example, when we are wearing the mask and meet a friend, are our facial expressions different compared to when we are not? We investigated the effect of face mask wearing on facial expression, including the area around the eyes. We measured surface electromyography from zygomaticus major, orbicularis oculi, and depressor anguli oris muscles, when people smiled and talked with or without a mask. Only the actions of the orbicularis oculi were facilitated by wearing the mask. We thus concluded that mask wearing may increase the recruitment of the eyes during smiling. In other words, we can express joy and happiness even when wearing a face mask.","Okazaki, Shuntaro; Yamanami, Haruna; Nakagawa, Fumika; Takuwa, Nozomi; Kawabata Duncan, Keith James",Scientific reports,516,1

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that are involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Altered abundance levels of ODF2 and UBQLN3 have been reported in patients with different spermatogenic impairments. However, the transcriptional regulation of these two genes by miR-23a/b-3p is still unclear. OBJECTIVES To investigate experimentally whether miR-23a/b-3p targets the genes ODF2 and UBQLN3 and whether this targeting impacts abundance levels of ODF2 and UBQLN3 in patients with oligoasthenozoospermia. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 92 men attending a fertility clinic were included in the study, including 46 oligoasthenozoospermic men and 46 age-matched normozoospermic volunteers who served as controls. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), Western blot, and dual-luciferase (Firefly-Renilla) assays were used to validate the miRNAs and their target genes. RESULTS RT-qPCR revealed that miR-23a/b-3p was more abundant and ODF2 and UBQLN3 targets were less abundant in men with impaired spermatogenesis. Besides, Western blot shows that ODF2 and UBQLN3 protein levels were reduced in men with impaired spermatogenesis. In silico prediction and dual-luciferase assays revealed that potential links exist between the higher abundance level of miR-23a/b-3p and the lower abundance level of ODF2 and UBQLN3 targets. Mutations in the miR-23a/b-3p-binding site within the 3'UTRs (3'untranslated regions) of ODF2 and UBQLN3 genes resulted in abrogated responsiveness to miR-23a/b-3p. Correlation analysis showed that sperm count, motility, and morphology were negatively correlated with miR-23a/b-3p and positively correlated with the lower abundance level of UBQLN3, while ODF lower abundance level was positively correlated with sperm motility. CONCLUSION Findings indicate that the higher abundance level of miR-23a/b-3p and the lower abundance level of ODF2 and UBQLN3 targets are associated with oligoasthenozoospermia and male subfertility.","Abu-Halima, Masood; Belkacemi, Anouar; Ayesh, Basim M; Simone Becker, Lea; Sindiani, Amer M; Fischer, Ulrike; Hammadeh, Mohamad; Keller, Andreas; Meese, Eckart",Andrology,516,10

Viral tissue tropism is an active area of investigation, one approach to which is identification of virus within tissues by electron microscopy of post-mortem and surgical specimens. Most diagnostic histopathologists have limited understanding of the ultrastructural features of normal cell trafficking pathways, which can resemble intra- and extracellular coronavirus; in addition, viral replication pathways make use of these trafficking pathways. Herein, we review these pathways and their ultrastructural appearances, with emphasis on structures which may be confused with coronavirus. In particular, we draw attention to the fact that, when using routine fixation and processing, the typical 'crown' that characterises a coronavirus is not readily identified on intracellular virions, which are located in membrane-bound vacuoles. In addition, the viral nucleocapsid is seen as black dots within the virion and is more discriminatory in differentiating virions from other cellular structures. The identification of the viral replication organelle, a collection of membranous structures (convoluted membranes) seen at a relatively low scanning power, may help draw attention to infected cells, which can be sparse.

The need to accommodate growing numbers of hospitalized patients has led facilities in affected areas to suspend anew or curtail normal hospital activities, including elective surgery, even as earlier-affected areas normalized surgical services. Backlogged surgical cases now number in the tens of millions globally. Facilities will be hard-pressed to address these backlogs, even absent the recrudescence of COVID-19. This document provides guidance for the safe and effective resumption of surgical services as circumstances permit. Methods: Review and synthesis of pertinent international peer-reviewed literature, with integration of expert opinion. Results: The ""second-wave"" of serious infections is placing the healthcare system under renewed stress. Surgical teams likely will encounter persons harboring the virus, whether symptomatic or not. Continued vigilance and protection of patients and staff remain paramount. Reviewed are the impact of COVID-19 on the surgical workforce, considerations for operating on a COVID-19 patient and the outcomes of such operations, the size and nature of the surgical backlog, and the logistics of resumption, including organizational considerations, patient and staff safety, preparation of the surgical candidate, and the role of enhanced recovery programs to reduce morbidity, length of stay, and cost by rational, equitable resource utilization. Conclusions: Resumption of surgical services requires institutional commitment (including teams of surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, pharmacists, therapists, dieticians, and administrators). Structured protocols and equitable implementation programs, and iterative audit, planning, and integration will improve outcomes, enhance safety, preserve resources, and reduce cost, all of which will contribute to safe and successful reduction of the surgical backlog.","Barie, Philip S; Ho, Vanessa P; Hunter, Catherine J; Kaufman, Elinore J; Narayan, Mayur; Pieracci, Fredric M; Schubl, Sebastian D; Heffernan, Daithi S; Huston, Jared M",Surgical infections,516,31

The goals of this systematic review were (1) to review the types of laryngeal injuries and their patient-reported symptoms and clinical signs resulting from endotracheal intubation in patients intubated for surgeries and (2) to better understand the overall the frequency at which these injuries occur. We conducted a search of 4 online bibliographic databases (ie, PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL], and The Cochrane Library) and ProQuest and Open Access Thesis Dissertations (OPTD) from database inception to September 2019 without restrictions for language. Studies that completed postextubation laryngeal examinations with visualization in adult patients who were endotracheally intubated for surgeries were included. We excluded (1) retrospective studies, (2) case studies, (3) preexisting laryngeal injury/disease, (4) patients with histories of or surgical interventions that risk injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, (5) conference abstracts, and (6) patient populations with nonfocal, neurological impairments that may impact voice and swallowing function, thus making it difficult to identify isolated postextubation laryngeal injury. Independent, double-data extraction, and risk of bias assessment followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the Cochrane Collaboration's criteria. Twenty-one articles (1 cross-sectional, 3 cohort, 5 case series, 12 randomized controlled trials) representing 21 surgical studies containing 6140 patients met eligibility criteria. The mean patient age across studies reporting age was 49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 45-53) years with a mean intubation duration of 132 (95% CI, 106-159) minutes. Studies reported no injuries in 80% (95% CI, 69-88) of patients. All 21 studies presented on type of injury. Edema was the most frequently reported mild injury, with a prevalence of 9%-84%. Vocal fold hematomas were the most frequently reported moderate injury, with a prevalence of 4% (95% CI, 2-10). Severe injuries that include subluxation of the arytenoids and vocal fold paralysis are rare (<1%) outcomes. The most prevalent patient complaints postextubation were dysphagia (43%), pain (38%), coughing (32%), a sore throat (27%), and hoarseness (27%). Overall, laryngeal injury from short-duration surgical intubation is common and is most often mild. No uniform guidelines for laryngeal assessment postextubation from surgery are available and hoarseness is neither a good indicator of laryngeal injury or dysphagia. Protocolized screening for dysphonia and dysphagia postextubation may lead to improved identification of injury and, therefore, improved patient outcomes and reduced health care utilization.","Brodsky, Martin B; Akst, Lee M; Jedlanek, Erin; Pandian, Vinciya; Blackford, Brendan; Price, Carrie; Cole, Gai; Mendez-Tellez, Pedro A; Hillel, Alexander T; Best, Simon R; Levy, Matthew J",Anesthesia and analgesia,516,30

We estimated the management of vascular access during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. RESULTS Of the 9231 hemodialysis patients included, 5387 patients (58.4%) were men and 2959 patients (32.1%) were older than 65 years. Arteriovenous fistula was the predominant type of vascular access, accounting for 76.5%; 496 patients (5.4%) developed vascular access complications; catheter flow reduction was the most common vascular access complication, and stenosis was the predominant complication among those with arteriovenous access. Overall, 280 vascular access sites were placed in patients newly diagnosed with uremia, of whom 260 (92.8%) underwent catheter insertion; 149 rescue procedures were carried out to treat the vascular access complications, which consisted of 132 catheters, 7 percutaneous transluminal angioplasties, 6 arteriovenous fistula repairs, and 4 arteriovenous fistulas. Occlusion of the arteriovenous access had the highest rescue rate (92.7%), while many other vascular access complications remained untreated; 69 and 142 patients were diagnosed with confirmed and suspected coronavirus disease 2019, respectively.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS the study group consisted of individuals who resided in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region and who underwent COVID-19 testing from 01.03 to 24.04.2020. The study group was identified from the laboratory database, which contains all the microbiological testing performed in regional facilities. Tested people were categorized into positive or negative cases, based on test results. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES probability of being tested for and cumulative incidence of COVID-19. RESULTS the cumulative probability of being tested for COVID-19 was 278/10,000 inhabitants, while the cumulative incidence was 22 cases/10,000. Out of 33,853 tested people, 2,744 (8.1%) turned out to be positive for COVID-19. Women were tested more often than men (337 vs 216/10,000), and they showed a higher incidence of infection than men (25 and 19 infected cases/10,000 residents, respectively). Both cumulative incidence and cumulative probability of being tested were higher in the elderly population. About 25% of infected people was hosted in retirement homes and 9% was represented by healthcare workers.

The study examined statements about Medicaid expansion made by all Republican governors as reported in two large newspapers in each governor's state from 28 June 2012 to 31 December 2018. A slight majority of the statements (183 or 58.5%) used moral arguments in support of Medicaid expansion. Governors from both policy camps most frequently used the moral foundations shared by liberals and conservatives: care/harm and fairness/cheating. Those supporting expansion also used loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation. Those opposing expansion used liberty/oppression. Policymakers recognize that activating the public's moral intuitions can be an effective way to advance a policy of interest. Those interested in advancing health policies would do well to better understand the kind of moral arguments that are used with potential supporters and arguments that may be used by opponents.","Rozier, Michael D; Singer, Phillip M",AJOB empirical bioethics,516,19

With a goal to delineate radiation induced changes in gene expression, we followed eight NHPs for 60 days after exposure to 6.5 Gy gamma-radiation for survival outcomes. Analysis of differential gene expression in response to radiation exposure yielded 26,944 dysregulated genes that were not significantly impacted by sex. Further analysis showed an increased association of several pathways including IL-3 signaling, ephrin receptor signaling, ErbB signaling, nitric oxide signaling in the cardiovascular system, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and inflammasome pathway, which were associated with positive survival outcomes in NHPs after acute exposure to radiation. This study provides novel insights into major pathways and networks involved in radiation-induced injuries that may identify biomarkers for radiation injury.","Li, Yaoxiang; Singh, Jatinder; Varghese, Rency; Zhang, Yubo; Fatanmi, Oluseyi O; Cheema, Amrita K; Singh, Vijay K",Scientific reports,516,1

High rates of cerebral desaturation events (CDEs) have been reported during surgery in the beach chair position. However, correlations have not been made with blood pressure measured at the cerebral level. The purpose of this study was to examine the correlations between brachial noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) and estimated temporal mean arterial pressure (eTMAP) during CDEs in the beach chair position. METHODS Fifty-seven patients underwent elective shoulder surgery in the beach chair position. Values for eTMAP, NIBP, and rSO2 were recorded supine (0°) after induction and when a CDE occurred in the 70° beach chair position. Twenty-six patients experienced 45 CDEs, defined as a 20% drop in rSO2 from baseline. RESULTS Median reduction in NIBP, eTMAP, and rSO2 from baseline to the CDE were 48.2%, 75.5%, and 33.3%, respectively. At baseline, there was a significant weak negative correlation between rSO2 and NIBP (rs = -0.300; P = .045) and no significant association between rSO2 and eTMAP (rs = -0.202; P = .183). During CDEs, there were no significant correlations between rSO2 and NIBP (rs = -0.240; P = .112) or between rSO2 and eTMAP (rs = -0.190; P = .212). No significant correlation between the decrease in rSO2 and NIBP (rs = 0.064; P = .675) or between rSO2 and eTMAP (rs = 0.121; P = .430) from baseline to CDE was found. CONCLUSION NIBP and eTMAP are unreliable methods for identifying a CDE in the beach chair position. Cerebral oximetry provides additional information to the values obtained from NIBP and eTMAP, and all should be considered independently and collectively.","Triplet, Jacob J; Lonetta, Christopher M; Levy, Jonathan C; Everding, Nathan G; Moor, Molly A",Journal of shoulder and elbow surgery,516,1

At present there is insufficient evidence from clinical trials to determine the safety and efficacy of HCQ as a treatment for COVID-19. However, since the World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorisation to allow HCQ and Chloroquine (CQ) to be distributed and used for certain hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and numerous clinical trials are underway around the world, including the UK based RECOVERY trial, with over 1000 volunteers. The validation of a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous determination of HCQ and two of its major metabolites, desethylchloroquine (DCQ) and di-desethylchloroquine (DDCQ), in whole blood is described. Methods Blood samples were deproteinised using acetonitrile. HCQ, DCQ and DDCQ were chromatographically separated on a biphenyl column with gradient elution, at a flow rate of 500 μL/min. The analysis time was 8 min. Results For each analyte linear calibration curves were obtained over the concentration range 50-2000 μg/L, the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 13 μg/L, the inter-assay relative standard deviation (RSD) was <10% at 25, 800 and 1750 μg/L and mean recoveries were 80, 81, 78 and 62% for HCQ, d4-HCQ, DCQ and DDCQ, respectively.

The influence of pH was investigated in the pH range of 1.0 to 9.0. Facilitated adsorption of TU on electrode surface results in enhanced catalytic response in acidic medium and maximum electro-catalytic response was found at pH~3.0. Chronoamperometric (CA) experiment determined this oxidation as 1e - transfer process and the variation of TU concentration reveals a 1st order kinetics. In the CV responses, the large value of peak separation ( ∆E p > 380 mV) calculated by the variation of scan rate indicates that oxidation of TU is an irreversible process. With the aid of convolution potential sweep voltammetry (CPSV), the standard rate constant ( k °) for the reaction was found to be 7.1´10 -4 cm/s and the formal potential constant ( E° ¢ ) was evaluated to be ~0.37 V vs Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl). The value of transfer coefficient ( α ) was found to vary from 0.74 to 0.40 with applied potential ( E ). From the potential dependent variation of transfer coefficient ( α ) and activation energy (∆G ≠ ), it was concluded that the overall electrochemical oxidation of TU follows a stepwise mechanism at lower potential (<0.40) V and a concerted one at relatively higher potential (>0.40) V. The FTIR analysis of the product after oxidation of TU molecules confirmed the appearance of a new sharp band near 530 cm -1 due to the formation of S-S bonds suggesting formation of formamidine disulfide (FD) ions.","Shabik, Md Fazle; Begum, Humayra; Rahman, Mohammed M; Hasnat, Mohammad A; Marwani, Hadi M","Chemistry, an Asian journal",516,6

METHODS Prospective, single-center investigator initiated randomized controlled trial in a comprehensive stroke center focusing on time from imaging to groin puncture (primary end point) and time from hospital admission to final angiographic result (secondary end point) in patients receiving mechanical thrombectomy for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion after randomization to the CTT or DTAS pathway. RESULTS The trial was stopped early after the enrollment of n=60 patients (CTT: n=34/60 [56.7 %]; DTAS: n=26/60 [43.3%]) of n=110 planned patients because of a preplanned interim analysis. Time from imaging to groin puncture was shorter in DTAS-patients (in minutes, median [interquartile range]: CTT: 26 [23-32]; DTAS: 19 [15-23]; P value: 0.001). Time from hospital admission to stroke imaging was shorter in patients randomized to DTAS (CTT: 12 (7-18); DTAS: 21 (15-25), P value: 0.007). Time from hospital admission to final angiographic reperfusion was comparable between patient groups (CTT: 78 [58-92], DTAS: 80 [66-118]; P value: 0.067). CONCLUSIONS This trial showed a reduction in time from imaging to groin-puncture when patients are transferred directly to the angiosuite for advanced stroke-imaging compared with imaging in a CT scanner suite. This time saving was outweighed by a longer admission to imaging time and could not translate into a shorter time to final angiographic reperfusion in this trial.","Pfaff, Johannes A R; Schönenberger, Silvia; Herweh, Christian; Ulfert, Christian; Nagel, Simon; Ringleb, Peter A; Bendszus, Martin; Möhlenbruch, Markus A",Stroke,516,1

As part of efforts to improve the reliability of forensic evidence, scientific and policy groups increasingly recommend routine and blind proficiency tests of practitioners. What is not known is how doing so affects how lay jurors assess testimony by forensic practitioners in court. In Study 1, we recruited 1398 lay participants, recruited online using Qualtrics to create a sample representative of the U.S. population with respect to age, gender, income, race/ethnicity, and geographic region. Each read a mock criminal trial transcript in which a forensic examiner presented the central evidence. The low-proficiency forensic examiner elicited a lower conviction rate and less favorable impressions than the control, an examiner for which no proficiency information was disclosed. However, the high-proficiency examiner did not correspondingly elicit a higher conviction rate or more favorable impressions than the control. In Study 2, 1420 participants, similarly recruited using Qualtrics, received the same testimony, but for some conditions the examiner was cross-examined by a defense attorney. We find cross-examination significantly reduced guilty votes and examiner ratings for low-proficiency examiners. These results suggest that disclosing results of blind proficiency testing can inform jury decision-making, and further, that defense lawyering can make proficiency information particularly salient at a criminal trial.","Crozier, William E; Kukucka, Jeff; Garrett, Brandon L",Forensic science international,516,10

However, the benefits of this approach have never been scientifically validated. We thus compared the early and late administration of rocuronium before and after checking mask ventilation to investigate the efficiency of mask ventilation and the time to tracheal intubation in patients with normal airways. METHODS Patients (n = 114) were randomized to receive IV rocuronium either before (early rocuronium group, n = 58) or after (late rocuronium group, n = 56) checking mask ventilation. Expiratory tidal volumes (VTs) were measured at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 seconds after apnea during mask ventilation. We graded the ease of mask ventilation and measured the time from apnea to tracheal intubation. The primary outcome was the average of mask VTs measured at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 seconds after apnea. The main secondary outcome was the time from apnea to tracheal intubation. STATA was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS The average of mask VTs measured at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 seconds after apnea was larger in the early rocuronium group than in the late rocuronium group (552 mL breath [165 mL breath] vs 393 mL breath [165 mL breath], mean difference, 160 mL breath; 95% CI, 98-221 mL breath; P < .001, unpaired t test). Because the interaction between time and group was significant in mask VTs measured at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 seconds after apnea (P < .001, linear mixed effects model), pairwise comparisons were performed at the 6 time points. The differences in VTs between the groups were significant at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 seconds after apnea (P < .001 each, contrast statements in STATA). The time from apnea to tracheal intubation was shorter in the early rocuronium group than in the late rocuronium group (116 seconds [42 seconds] vs 195 seconds [41 seconds]; mean difference, -79 seconds; 95% CI, -96 to -64 seconds, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS The early administration of rocuronium before checking mask ventilation resulted in a larger mask VT and earlier tracheal intubation than the late administration of rocuronium after checking mask ventilation in patients with normal airways.","Min, Se-Hee; Im, Hyunjae; Kim, Bo Rim; Yoon, Susie; Bahk, Jae-Hyon; Seo, Jeong-Hwa",Anesthesia and analgesia,516,22

PH refers to the incomplete pulmonary development due to embryologic imbalance of bronchial development between the lung buds, while CLE is defined as alveolar hyperinflation due to bronchial collapse during expiration caused by bronchial cartilage dysplasia, external bronchial compression, and idiopathic etiology. CLE may develop into pulmonary blebs or bullae that may rupture and induce a spontaneous pneumothorax. There are no reports on concurrent PH and CLE in animals. CASE PRESENTATION A 7-month-old castrated male Italian Greyhound weighing 5.5 kg presented with vomiting and acute onset of severe dyspnea without any previous history of disease. After emergency treatment including oxygen supplementation and thoracocentesis, plain radiology and computed tomography scanning were performed and lobar emphysema with multiple bullae in the left cranial lung lobe associated with tension pneumothorax was identified. Since the pneumothorax was not resolved despite continuous suction of intrathoracic air for 3 days, a complete lobectomy of the left cranial lung lobe was performed. The excised lobe was not grossly divided into cranial and caudal parts, but a tissue mass less than 1 cm in size was present at the hilum and cranial to the excised lobe. Postoperatively, the dog recovered rapidly without air retention in the thoracic cavity. Histopathologically, the mass was identified as a hypoplastic lung tissue with collapsed alveoli, bronchial dysplasia, and pulmonary arterial hypertrophy. Additionally, the excised lung lobe presented CLE with marked ectasia of alveoli, various blebs and bullae, and general bronchial cartilage dysplasia. According to gross and histopathologic findings, the dog was diagnosed with concurrent PH and CLE in the left cranial lung lobe. During 16 months of follow-up, the dog was well and without any respiratory problems. CONCLUSIONS This case report confirmed the clinical and histologic features of two different types of rare congenital pulmonary anomalies, PH and CLE, which occurred concurrently in a single lung lobe of a young dog. The condition was successfully managed with lobectomy.","Han, Hyun-Jung; Kim, Jung-Hyun",Acta veterinaria Scandinavica,516,1

IRT is a useful tool that has been used mainly as a diagnostic method for various stress-causing pathologies, though recent suggestions indicate that it can be used to assess the block quality of certain body regions. In the field of anaesthesiology, IRT has been applied to brachial and epidural blocks, while in algology, changes in surface blood circulation associated with sympathetic activity have been investigated. Thermography has also been employed to complement pain level scales based on the facial expressions of patients in critical condition, or after surgery. In addition, it has been used as a tool in research designed to evaluate different surgical procedures in human medicine, as in the case of surgical burrs for placing dental implants, where IRT helps assess the degree of heating associated with bone devascularisation, reduction in vascular perfusion as a consequence of stroke, and changes in the autonomous nervous system, or the degree of vascular changes in flaps applied to burn patients. In veterinary medicine, thermography has brought several benefits for animals in terms of evaluating lesions, diseases, and surgical procedures. The aim of this review is to evaluate how IRT can be used as a tool in surgical procedures, cases of vascular change, and pain monitoring in veterinary medicine with an emphasis on small animals.","Casas-Alvarado, Alejandro; Mota-Rojas, Daniel; Hernández-Ávalos, Ismael; Mora-Medina, Patricia; Olmos-Hernández, Adriana; Verduzco-Mendoza, Antonio; Reyes-Sotelo, Brenda; Martínez-Burnes, Julio",Journal of thermal biology,516,0

METHODS we reviewed 3D US volumes acquired transvaginally (TVUS) through the anterior fontanelle, between 14-17 weeks. The following landmarks were recognized: tela-choroidea (TC), foramina of Moro, early CC and the evolving cavum septi pellucidi. The following measurements were taken: total, anterior and posterior sections, and height of the CC (referenced to the anterior TC border). All measurements were correlated to both the gestational age and the transverse cerebellar diameter (TCD). RESULTS Eighty nine volumes were included in the study (mean 15.1 weeks +/- 0.84, TCD range: 13.1-18.4 mm) with high inter and intra observer correlation of the measurements. We found high correlation between CC length and height, and TCD. The anterior segment of the CC appear earlier than the posterior one, and growth continues bi-directionally. Initially, the posterior elongation is significantly larger than the anterior one. Association of all CC measurements with TCD remained significant when co-varying for maternal age and fetal sex.

However, the viral glycoprotein determinants responsible for initiating the IFN response remain unidentified. In this study, we have used a collection of 60 synthetic 20-mer overlapping peptides (pepscan) spanning the full length of glycoprotein G (gpG) of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) to investigate what regions of this protein are implicated in triggering the type I IFN-associated immune responses. Briefly, two regions with ability to increase severalfold the basal expression level of the IFN-stimulated mx gene and to restrict the spread of virus among responder cells were mapped to amino acid residues 280 to 310 and 340 to 370 of the gpG protein of VHSV. In addition, the results obtained suggest that an interaction between VHSV gpG and integrins might trigger the host IFN-mediated antiviral response after VHSV infection. Since it is known that type I IFN plays an important role in determining/modulating the protective-antigen-specific immune responses, the identification of viral glycoprotein determinants directly implicated in the type I IFN induction might be of special interest for designing new adjuvants and/or more-efficient and cost-effective viral vaccines as well as for improving our knowledge on how to stimulate the innate immune system.","Chico, V; Martinez-Lopez, A; Ortega-Villaizan, M; Falco, A; Perez, L; Coll, J M; Estepa, A",Journal of virology,516,1

The present study aims to identify and critically review studies examining the frequency of grazing in both clinical and community samples, as well as, to investigate its relationship with eating disorder psychopathology, Loss of Control eating (LOC), psychological impairment, and weight-related variables. This systematic review followed the PRISMA recommendations for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analysis. A total of 138 articles were initially retrieved from the database search. In the end, 18 articles were considered for this systematic review. The results were separated in Grazing and Grazing-like behavior (picking and nibbling). Results of studies of grazing-like behaviors displays that, in these studies, the results are sometimes inconsistent and controversial. On the other hand, studies of Grazing behavior showed more consistent results. These results show that the use of different definitions across the literature makes it difficult to establish comparisons across studies. In this literature review, the studies selected used five different definitions of grazing and five different instruments to assess this eating behavior which reinforces the requirement for standardized definition and evaluation.

It has been suggested that the influenza vaccine might attenuate the severity of COVID-19. METHODS This is a retrospective single-centered cohort review of a de-identified database of 2005 patients over the age of 18 within the University of Florida health care system who tested positive for COVID-19. Comorbidities and influenza vaccination status were examined. The primary outcome was severity of disease as reflected by hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between influenza status and hospitalization. RESULTS COVID-19-positive patients who had not received the influenza vaccination within the last year had a 2.44 (95% CI, 1.68, 3.61) greater odds of hospitalization and a 3.29 (95% CI, 1.18, 13.77) greater odds of ICU admission when compared with those who were vaccinated. These results were controlled to account for age, race, gender, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. DISCUSSION Our analysis suggests that the influenza vaccination is potentially protective of moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 infection. This protective effect holds regardless of comorbidity. The literature points to a potential mechanism via natural killer cell activation. Though our data potentially is limited by its generalizability and our vaccination rate is low, it holds significant relevance given the upcoming influenza season. Not only could simply encouraging influenza vaccination decrease morbidity and mortality from the flu, but it might help flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic as well. We encourage further studies into this finding.","Yang, Ming-Jim; Rooks, Benjamin J; Le, Thanh-Tam Thi; Santiago, Inocente O; Diamond, Jeffrey; Dorsey, Nicholas L; Mainous, Arch G",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,516,7

Immediate-type allergy to PEGs including anaphylaxis are rare. The recent introduction of the mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines has led to an increased focus on PEG as a possible culprit of allergic reactions to the vaccine. A low awareness of the allergenic potential of PEG among consumers, manufacturers and doctors leads to under-diagnosis and under-reporting of allergy to PEGs, putting patients at risk of repeated severe reactions. OBJECTIVES To investigate clinical manifestations, time to diagnosis and impact of a PEG allergy diagnosis on the daily life of patients diagnosed with allergy to PEG from 2010 to 2019. METHOD Ten patients diagnosed with allergy to PEG were included. Detailed clinical history was obtained, and allergy investigations had been performed at the time of diagnosis. All patients were contacted and asked to retrospectively complete a questionnaire about causes and impact on daily life of an allergy to PEG, scored on a likert scale (0-10) before and after diagnosis. RESULTS Eight patients had experienced at least one anaphylactic reaction requiring adrenaline treatment. Anaphylaxis was primarily caused by antibiotic/analgesic tablets, depot-steroids, antacids and laxatives. Seven patients reported repeated reactions before diagnosis (median 3, range 2-6). Median time from first reaction to diagnosis was 20 months (range 2-120). None of the patients experienced severe allergic reactions after the diagnosis. Median likert score of the impact on daily life before diagnosis was 7 compared to 4 after diagnosis. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The clinical manifestations of PEG allergy are often dramatic. Improved awareness about the clinical presentation and common culprits, clear product labelling and a standardized nomenclature is needed to ensure timely diagnosis of PEG allergy to prevent repeated anaphylactic reactions with severe impact on patient's lives.","Bruusgaard-Mouritsen, Maria A; Johansen, Jeanne D; Garvey, Lene H",Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,516,5

METHODS Thirty-five patients with medial compartment knee OA were assessed for the presence of effusion using a brush test. Based on the results, they were assigned to the knee effusion (n = 17) and no knee effusion (n = 18) groups. Electromyograms from seven lower extremity muscles (lateral and medial gastrocnemius, vastus lateralis and medialis, rectus femoris and the lateral and medial hamstrings), leg motion and ground reaction forces were recorded during self-selected walking. Isometric knee extensor, plantar flexor and knee flexor strength were measured. Discrete measures from angular knee motion and net external moment of force waveforms were identified. Principal component analysis extracted electromyographic waveform features. Analysis of variance models tested for main effects (group, muscle) and interactions (α = 0.05). Bonferroni post-hoc testing was employed. RESULTS No differences in age, body mass index, knee pain, Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index scores, gait velocity and muscle strength were found between groups (P > 0.05). Individuals with effusion had a greater overall quadriceps activation and prolonged hamstring activation into mid-stance (P < 0.05). Knee joint flexion angles were higher (P < 0.05) and net external knee extension (KE) moments in mid to late stance lower in the effusion group. CONCLUSION Quadriceps and hamstrings activation during walking were altered when effusions were present. Increased knee flexion (KF) angles and decreased KE moment in mid-late stance provide a mechanical explanation for the effect of joint effusion on muscle activation in those with knee OA.","Rutherford, D J; Hubley-Kozey, C L; Stanish, W D",Osteoarthritis and cartilage,516,1

To determine the effect of two doses BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination schedule in individuals who recovered from COVID-19 (COVID-19 recovered) compared to naïve subjects, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific T and B cell responses, as well as specific IgA, IgG, IgM and neutralizing antibodies titers in 22 individuals who received BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, 11 of which had a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evaluations were performed before vaccination and then weekly until 7 days post second injection. Data obtained clearly showed that one vaccine dose is sufficient to increase both cellular and humoral immune response in COVID-19 recovered subjects without any additional improvement after the second dose. On the contrary, the second dose is proved mandatory in naïve ones to further enhance the immune response. These findings were further confirmed at serological level in a larger cohort of naïve (68) and COVID-19 recovered (29) subjects, tested up to 50 days post vaccination. These results question whether a second vaccine injection in COVID-19 recovered subjects is required and indicate that millions of vaccine doses may be redirected to naïve individuals, thus shortening the time to reach herd immunity.","Mazzoni, Alessio; Di Lauria, Nicoletta; Maggi, Laura; Salvati, Lorenzo; Vanni, Anna; Capone, Manuela; Lamacchia, Giulia; Mantengoli, Elisabetta; Spinicci, Michele; Zammarchi, Lorenzo; Kiros, Seble Tekle; Rocca, Arianna; Lagi, Filippo; Colao, Maria Grazia; Parronchi, Paola; Scaletti, Cristina; Turco, Lucia; Liotta, Francesco; Rossolini, Gian Maria; Cosmi, Lorenzo; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Annunziato, Francesco",The Journal of clinical investigation,516,19

Treatment aims are to relieve symptoms and prevent disease-related complications. Naftopidil is an alpha-blocker (AB) that has a high affinity for the A1d receptor that may have advantages in treating LUTS in this setting. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2009. Since that time, several large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported, making this update relevant. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effects of naftopidil for the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH. SEARCH METHODS We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, LILAC, and Web of Science), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status up to 31 May 2018 SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all parallel RCTs. We also included cross-over design trials. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently classified and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Primary outcomes were urological symptom scores, quality of life (QoL) and treatment withdrawals for any reason; secondary outcomes were treatment withdrawals due to adverse events, acute urinary retention, surgical intervention for BPH, and cardiovascular and sexual adverse events. We considered outcomes measured up to 12 months after randomisation as short term, and later than 12 months as long term. We rated the certainty of the evidence according to the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We included 22 RCTs with 2223 randomised participants across four comparisons for short-term follow-up. This abstract focuses on only two of four comparisons for which we found data since two comparators (i.e. propiverine and Eviprostat (phytotherapy)) are rarely used. One study comparing naftopidil to placebo did not report any relevant outcomes and was therefore excluded. There were no trials that compared to combination therapy with naftopidil or any 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) to combination therapy with other ABs and any 5-ARIs.All included studies were conducted in Asian countries. Study duration ranged from four to 12 weeks. Mean age was 67.8 years, prostate volume was 35.4 mL, and International Prostate Symptom Score was 18.3. We were unable to perform any of the preplanned subgroup analyses based on age and baseline symptom score.Naftopidil versus tamsulosinBased on 12 studies with 965 randomised participants, naftopidil may have resulted in little or no difference in urological symptom score (mean difference (MD) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.09 to 1.04 measured on a scale from 0 to 35 with higher score representing increased symptoms), QoL (MD 0.11, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.30; measured on a scale from 0 to 6 with higher scores representing worse QoL), and treatment withdrawals for any reason (risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.34; corresponding to 7 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 32 fewer to 31 more). Naftopidil may have resulted in little to no difference in sexual adverse events (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.22); this would result in 26 fewer sexual adverse events per 1000 participants (95% CI 43 fewer to 13 more). We rated the certainty of evidence as moderate for urological symptom score and low for the other outcomes.Naftopidil versus silodosinBased on five studies with 652 randomised participants, naftopidil may have resulted in little or no difference in the urological symptom scores (MD 1.04, 95% CI -0.78 to 2.85), QoL (MD 0.21, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.66), and treatment withdrawals for any reason (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.23; corresponding to 26 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 62 fewer to 32 more). We rated the certainty of evidence as low for all these outcomes. Naftopidil likely reduced sexual adverse events (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.42; corresponding to 126 fewer sexual adverse events per 1000 participants, 95% CI 139 fewer to 86 fewer). We rated the certainty of evidence as moderate for sexual adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Naftopidil appears to have similar effects in the urological symptom scores and QoL compared to tamsulosin and silodosin. Naftopidil has similar sexual adverse events compared to tamsulosin but has fewer compared to silodosin.","Hwang, Eu Chang; Gandhi, Shreyas; Jung, Jae Hung; Imamura, Mari; Kim, Myung Ha; Pang, Ran; Dahm, Philipp",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,516,1

Although breastfeeding rates in the United States have increased during the past decade, racial/ethnic disparities persist (2). Breastfeeding surveillance typically focuses on disparities at the national level, because small sample sizes limit examination of disparities at the state or territorial level. However, birth certificate data allow for assessment of breastfeeding initiation among nearly all newborn infants in the United States both nationally and at the state and territorial levels. To describe breastfeeding initiation by maternal race/ethnicity,* CDC analyzed 2019 National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) birth certificate data for 3,129,646 births from 48 of the 50 states (all except California and Michigan†), the District of Columbia (DC), and three U.S. territories (Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico). The prevalence of breastfeeding initiation was 84.1% overall and varied by maternal race/ethnicity, ranging from 90.3% among infants of Asian mothers to 73.6% among infants of Black mothers, a difference of 16.7 percentage points. Across states, the magnitude of disparity between the highest and lowest breastfeeding rates by racial/ethnic groups varied, ranging from 6.6 percentage points in Vermont to 37.6 percentage points in North Dakota, as did the specific racial/ethnic groups with the highest and lowest rates. These state/territory-specific data highlight the variation that exists in breastfeeding disparities across the United States and can help public health practitioners and health departments identify groups on which to focus efforts. Targeting breastfeeding promotion programs on populations with lower breastfeeding rates might help reduce racial/ethnic disparities in breastfeeding initiation and improve infant nutrition and health.","Chiang, Katelyn V; Li, Ruowei; Anstey, Erica H; Perrine, Cria G",MMWR.

By following the disappearance of resonances of protons near the endoperoxide group in ATS, the rate at which the drug is activated can be directly measured. In an aqueous medium, the rate of ATS activation is limited by the rate of reduction of the FPIX Fe(III) center by GSH. The reaction is observed to slow dramatically in the presence of other heme binding antimalarial drugs. These findings explain the long observed antagonism between artemisinin derivatives and quinoline-based drugs. This discovery suggests that combination therapy that involves artemisinin or any of its derivatives and a quinoline-based drug may be compromised.","Heller, Laura; Roepe, Paul D; de Dios, Angel C",Inorganica chimica acta,516,1

The aim of this study was to assess the increase in FLAIR signal intensity in a large patient cohort and in subgroups to assess its prognostic value for early tumor recurrence in glioma patients. METHODS A total of 212 patients (213 cases) who had undergone surgery for an intracranial glioma (WHO Grade IV [n = 103], WHO Grade III [n = 57], and WHO Grade II [n = 53]) were included in this retrospective study. FLAIR signal within the resection cavity at the time of tumor recurrence/last contact and on the previous MRI study was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. Appearance of FLAIR signal increase was studied over time using Kaplan-Meier estimates in subgroups. RESULTS Patients with WHO Grade II glioma and connection of the resection cavity to CSF who did not undergo radiotherapy did not regularly develop this sign and were excluded from further analysis. For the remaining 87 cases, FLAIR signal intensity increase was observed in 27 cases. Recurrent disease was found in 26 of these 27 cases, resulting in a specificity of 80.0%, a sensitivity of 31.7%, and positive and negative predictive values of 96.3% and 6.7%, respectively. In 4 cases this sign had been observed prior (range 2.8-8.5 months) to tumor recurrence defined by standard criteria. Quantitative analysis underlined the results of qualitative analysis, but it did not add a diagnostic value. CONCLUSIONS Signal intensity increase of the fluid within the resection cavity on FLAIR images is a rare but highly specific and early sign for tumor recurrence/tumor progression in completely and incompletely resected high-grade glioma without connection of the resection cavity to CSF and with radiotherapy.","Bette, Stefanie; Gempt, Jens; Huber, Thomas; Delbridge, Claire; Meyer, Bernhard; Zimmer, Claus; Kirschke, Jan S; Boeckh-Behrens, Tobias",Journal of neurosurgery,516,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective data (January 1, 2018, to July 31, 2020) on firearm incidents/injuries/deaths and types of firearm violence were obtained from the Gun Violence Archive. The periods for SAH and reopening for the US were based on dates for California. Ohio dates were based on Ohio's timeline. Mann-Whitney U analyses compared trends and types of daily firearm violence per 100,000 legal firearm owners across 2018-2020 periods. RESULTS In California, SAH and reopening orders had no effect on firearm violence in 2020 compared with 2018 and 2019 periods, respectively. In Ohio, daily median firearm deaths increased during 2020 SAH compared with 2018 and 2019 and firearm incidents and injuries increased during 2020 reopening compared with 2018, 2019 and 2020 SAH. In the United States, during 2020, SAH firearm deaths increased compared with historical controls and firearm incidents, deaths and injuries increased during 2020 reopening compared with 2018, 2019 and 2020 SAH (all P < 0.05).

AIM The aim is to evaluate the impact of an early assisted rehabilitation program on the functional status of an acutely hospitalized population affected by COVID-19. DESIGN Single-institution retrospective longitudinal study. SETTING Inpatient Intensive Care Units (ICU) and Medical Care Units (MCU). POPULATION Acute COVID-19 Patients. METHODS General information was collected; age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index was used for comorbidities. Duration of hospital stay, the length of stay in ICU and/or MCU, the length of the rehabilitative treatment, and the destination at the discharge were collected. Evaluation was performed when patients were clinically stable (T0), and at hospital discharge (T1); for subjects enrolled in ICU functional status was assessed at the time of transfer to the MCU. Muscle strength of the four limbs was measured with the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum-score. Functional status was assessed using the 3-item Barthel index (BI-3) and the General physical mobility score (GPMS). Early assisted-tailored rehabilitation protocol was applied in ICU and in MCU: the aims were the maintenance (or recovery) of the range of motion and of the strength and the recovery of sitting/standing position and gait. RESULTS we evaluated 116 patients (mean age 65, SD 11) (65% male) , 68 in ICU (mean age 60,SD 10), 48 in MCU (mean age 73,SD 9). At discharge, BI-3 and GPMS significantly improved in both ICU (p<0,001) and MCU (p<0,001) subgroups of patients. MRC sum-score significantly improved in ICU patients (p<0.001). Patients hospitalized in ICU had a significantly longer hospital stay. At discharge, patients admitted to the ICU reach a functional state that is close to that of patients admitted to the MCU. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that an early assisted rehabilitation program may be helpful in improving the short-term functional status of an acutely hospitalized population affected by COVID-19, with discharge at home of 48%.

The present study was conducted when the pandemic was spreading exponentially in the United States. To address important theoretical questions about age differences in emotional experience in times of crisis, we surveyed a representative sample of 945 Americans between the ages of 18 and 76 years and assessed the frequency and intensity of a range of positive and negative emotions. We also assessed perceived risk of contagion and complications from the virus, as well as personality, health, and demographic characteristics. Age was associated with relatively greater emotional well-being both when analyses did and did not control for perceived risk and other covariates. The present findings extend previous research about age and emotion by demonstrating that older adults' relatively better emotional well-being persists even in the face of prolonged stress.","Carstensen, Laura L; Shavit, Yochai Z; Barnes, Jessica T",Psychological science,516,19

The patient had suffered from recurrent catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) since 2009, despite several prevention approaches and attempts. In 2013, the patient's catheter was substituted for the BIP Foley Catheter, coated with a noble metal alloy (NMA) of gold, silver, and palladium. Method This is a retrospective-prospective clinical case study covering 4 years history for the control catheters and up to 2.5 years for the anti-infective BIP Foley Catheter. CAUTI incidences, symptoms, antibiotics, catheter performance, and comfort were evaluated. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines were measured pre- and post-substitution to BIP Foley Catheter in urine of the case and of four other permanently catheterized patients. In addition, the levels of noble metals were assessed in urine of the case subject during use of the BIP Foley Catheter. Results While using control catheters, the patient experienced symptomatic CAUTIs requiring antibiotics almost every month for 4 years. After 1 month with the BIP Foley Catheter, the symptoms disappeared, and the patient remained free of symptomatic CAUTIs and antibiotic treatment for the following 2.5 years, despite bacteriuria. The patient was satisfied with the comfort during insertion, use, and removal of the BIP Foley Catheter. Urinary levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) decreased towards normal levels post catheter type substitution. Traces of noble metals detected in a few urine samples were ⩽4% of the permitted daily exposure. The levels of the noble metals gold, silver, and palladium remaining on the BIP Foley Catheter after use were the same as for unused catheters. Conclusion Long-term use of a NMA-coated catheter was associated with cessation of frequent CAUTIs. The catheter was experienced as comfortable and inflammatory markers were reduced with time. The coating was stable, with no significant metal release into urine and is therefore safe for patient use.","Magnusson, Birgitta; Kai-Larsen, Ylva; Granlund, Petter; Seiger, Åke; Lindbo, Lena; Sanchez, Javier; Johansson, Dorota",Therapeutic advances in urology,516,17

MATERIALS AND METHODS Three-way 22Fr catheters from Bard (Bard Limited), Rusch Simplastic (Teleflex Medical), Dover (COVIDIEN), and Rusch Golden were included in the study. Irrigation channel, drainage channel, and overall CSAs were digitally measured with an image-processing program. Irrigation channel and drainage channel flow rates were measured and correlated with their corresponding catheter CSA values. RESULTS Catheter CSA and French value did not predict flow-rate characteristics, but irrigation channel CSA and drainage channel CSA were predictive. The 22Fr Rusch Simplastic catheter had the largest irrigation channel CSA (2.87 mm(2)) and drainage channel CSA (12.6 mm(2)), and had the greatest irrigation (5.27 ± 0.02 ml/s) and drainage flow rates (14.42 ± 0.22 ml/s). Twenty-two French gauge Rusch Golden catheters had the smallest irrigation channel CSA (1.34 mm(2)) and drainage channel CSA (7.82 mm(2)) and the lowest irrigation (1.83 ± 0.03 ml/s) and drainage flow rates (1.83 ± 0.03 ml/s). CONCLUSION An alternative catheter labelling system to include overall CSA, irrigation channel CSA, and drainage channel CSA values would provide more accurate and transparent data relevant to anticipated drainage and irrigation flow rates. The proposed labelling method will assist urologists in selecting 3-way catheters for bladder irrigation.","Davis, Niall F; Abdelrahman, Mamoun; Cunnane, Conor V; Cunnane, Eoghan M; Walsh, Michael T; Thornhill, John A",Urology,516,26

In view of this, patients with head and neck cancer may present with oral complications due to anticancer therapy, making dental assistance necessary. Thus, the objective of the study was to review the literature and critically discuss important concerns about the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because dental professionals are in close contact with the main viral transmission routes, this study presents recommendations for management and protection during clinical dental care. The main characteristics and transmission routes of COVID-19 are also discussed. Dental professionals should control pain and the side effects of antineoplastic treatment and use preventive measures for infection control. During this pandemic, patients with head and neck cancer should not undergo elective procedures, even if they do not have symptoms or a history of COVID-19; therefore, in asymptomatic or painless cases, only preventive actions are recommended. In symptomatic or painful cases, precautions for safe interventional treatments must be implemented by following the hygiene measures recommended by health agencies and using personal protective equipment. During health crises, new protocols emerge for cancer treatment, and professionals must act with greater attention toward biosafety and updated knowledge. It is important to offer adequate individualized treatment based on the recommendations of preventative and interventional treatments so that patients can face this difficult period with optimized quality of life.","Miranda, Rafael Resende de; Lopes, Camila de Carvalho Almança; Franco, Nathália Maria Afonso Silveira; Cabral, Luana Cardoso; Simamoto JÚnior, Paulo Cézar; Novais, Veridiana Resende",Brazilian oral research,516,1

Tetracyclines were developed as a result of the screening of soil samples for antibiotic organisms. The first of these compounds chlortetracycline was introduced in 1948. Soon after their development tetracyclines were found to be highly effective against various pathogens including rickettsiae, Gram-positive, and Gram-negative bacteria, thus, becoming a class of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The mechanism of action of tetracyclines is thought to be related to the inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the 30S bacterial ribosome. Tetracyclines are also an effective anti-malarial drug. Over time, many other ""protective"" actions have been described for tetracyclines. Minocycline, which can readily cross cell membranes, is known to be a potent anti-apoptotic agent. Its mechanism of action appears to relate to specific effects exerted on apoptosis signaling pathways. Another tetracycline, doxycycline is known to exert antiprotease activities. Doxycycline can inhibit matrix metalloproteinases, which contribute to tissue destruction activities in diseases such as gingivitis. A large body of literature has provided additional evidence for the ""beneficial"" actions of tetracyclines, including their ability to act as oxygen radical scavengers and anti-inflammatory agents. This increasing volume of published work and ongoing clinical trials supports the notion that a more systematic examination of their possible therapeutic uses is warranted. This review provides a summary of tetracycline's multiple mechanisms of action and while using the effects on the heart as an example, this review also notes their potential to benefit patients suffering from various pathologies such as cancer, Rosacea, and Parkinson's disease.","Griffin, Michael O; Fricovsky, Eduardo; Ceballos, Guillermo; Villarreal, Francisco",American journal of physiology.

As the COVID-19 was brought under control in China, the Department of General Surgery in Nanfang Hospital resumed regular medical services gradually. Based on our clinical practice, the four major measures of strengthening pre-hospital screening, perioperative prevention and control, medical staff protection, and ward management were adopted. These main measures include the strict implementation of the appointment system and triage system before admission; the conduction of epidemiological and preliminary screening of viral nucleic acids; the chest CT examination during the perioperative period to re-screen COVID-19; the reduction of the risk of droplets and aerosol transmission; the minimally invasive surgery combined with enhanced recovery program in order to reduce patient's susceptibility and shorten the length of postoperative hospital stay; the reinforcement of specific infection control training for medical staff; the strict implementation of hierarchical protection; the establishment of gastrointestinal surgery prevention and control system; the rehearsal of emergency exercise; the installation of quarantine wards; the screening and management of family care-givers; the strict disinfection of environment and materials.

Emerging evidence suggests that small-molecule metabolites derived from bacterial breakdown of a variety of dietary nutrients confer a wide array of host benefits, including amelioration of inflammation in IBDs. Yet, in many cases, the molecular pathways targeted by these molecules remain unknown. Here, we describe roles for three metabolites-indole-3-ethanol, indole-3-pyruvate, and indole-3-aldehyde-which are derived from gut bacterial metabolism of the essential amino acid tryptophan, in regulating intestinal barrier function. We determined that these metabolites protect against increased gut permeability associated with a mouse model of colitis by maintaining the integrity of the apical junctional complex and its associated actin regulatory proteins, including myosin IIA and ezrin, and that these effects are dependent on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Our studies provide a deeper understanding of how gut microbial metabolites affect host defense mechanisms and identify candidate pathways for prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for IBDs.","Scott, Samantha A; Fu, Jingjing; Chang, Pamela V",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,516,27

The Surpass flow diverter is a new system under evaluation in the USA. OBJECTIVE To report our initial experience of 20 cases with the Surpass flow diverter to demonstrate its basic properties, the required triaxial delivery platform, and the methodologies used to deploy it during treatment of large internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms METHODS Twenty patients with ICA aneurysms ≥10 mm with ≥4 mm neck treated as part of the Surpass IntraCranial Aneurysm Embolization System Pivotal Trial (the SCENT trial; Stryker) were included. Details of patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, and technical procedures were collected. RESULTS Twenty patients (mean age 63.3±1.3 years; range 51-72) with 20 unruptured aneurysms (mean size 13.4±0.9 mm; range 10-21 mm) were treated. For proximal access, 60% of cases had aortic arch ≥grade II, 55% had significant cervical ICA tortuosity, and 60% had cavernous ICA ≥grade II. The Surpass device was implanted in 19/20 (95%) cases. Of 19 cases, a single device was used in 18 cases (95%) and 2 devices in only 1 case (5%). Balloon angioplasty was performed in 8/19 cases (42%). Complete aneurysm neck coverage and adequate vessel wall apposition was obtained in all 19 cases. CONCLUSIONS Surpass is a next-generation flow diverter with unique device-specific and delivery-specific features compared with clinically available endoluminal flow diverters.

Methods We included 109 patients who underwent VATS pulmonary resection at Samsung Medical Center from October 1 to October 31, 2016. Eighty-five patients underwent VATS pulmonary resection with chest drain wound closure utilizing knotless suture material, and 24 patients underwent VATS pulmonary resection with chest drain wound closure by the conventional method. Complications related to the chest drain wound were compared between the 2 groups. Results There were 2 cases of pneumothorax after chest tube removal in both groups (8.3% in the conventional group, 2.3% in the knotless suture group; p=0.172) and there was 1 case of wound discharge due to wound dehiscence in the knotless suture group (0% in the conventional group, 1.2% in the knotless suture group; p=0.453). There was no reported case of chest tube dislodgement in either group. The complication rates were non-significantly different between the 2 groups. Conclusion The results for the complication rates of this new chest drain wound closure method suggest that this method is not inferior to the conventional method. Chest drain wound closure using knotless suture material is feasible based on the short-term results of the complication rate.","Kim, Min Soo; Shin, Sumin; Kim, Hong Kwan; Choi, Yong Soo; Kim, Jhingook; Zo, Jae Ill; Shim, Young Mog; Cho, Jong Ho",The Korean journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,516,19

Vaccine A was a water-in-oil emulsion containing the E2 glycoprotein originating from the Alfort/Tübingen strain and vaccine B was a water-oil-water emulsion containing the E2 glycoprotein originating from the Brescia strain. Eight groups, of ten pigs each, were vaccinated with either vaccine A or B, intramuscularly (IM) or intradermally (ID). Two different vaccination-challenge intervals were used for each vaccine. Furthermore, one group was vaccinated with a tenfold ID dose of vaccine A and one non-vaccinated group served as a control group. Five pigs from each group were challenged with the moderately virulent CSFV strain Paderborn, while the remaining five pigs served as contacts. Using vaccine A, full transmission to all contact pigs in both ID vaccinated groups occurred. No virus transmission was observed when IM vaccinated pigs were challenged 14 days post-vaccination (14dpv) whereas only one out of five contact pig became infected when they were challenged 10dpv. Using vaccine B no virus transmission was observed when pigs were ID or IM vaccinated and challenged 10dpv. When challenged 3dpv full transmission occurred in the ID vaccinated group, whereas four out of five contact pigs became infected in the IM vaccinated group. This result indicates that ID vaccination does not result in better protection against horizontal CSFV transmission compared to IM vaccination, for the vaccines studied.","Dortmans, J C F M; Loeffen, W L A; Weerdmeester, K; van der Poel, W H M; de Bruin, M G M",Vaccine,516,1

These subtypes are characterized by distinct sets of driver mutations and phenotypic appearance, and they often show varying degrees of heterogenicity, aggressiveness, and response/resistance to therapy. Intriguingly, lung cancers are also capable of showing features of multiple subtypes or converting from one subtype to another. The intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity of lung cancers as well as incidences of subtype transdifferentiation raise the question of to what extent the tumor characteristics are dictated by the cell of origin rather than the acquired driver lesions. We provide here an overview of the studies in experimental mouse models that try to address this question. These studies convincingly show that both the cell of origin and the genetic driver lesions play a critical role in shaping the phenotypes of lung tumors. However, they also illustrate that there is far from a direct one-to-one relationship between the cell of origin and the cancer subtype, as most epithelial cells can be reprogrammed toward diverse lung cancer fates when exposed to the appropriate set of driver mutations.","Ferone, Giustina; Lee, Myung Chang; Sage, Julien; Berns, Anton",Genes & development,516,1

The major risk factor for BE is gastroesophageal reflux disease, however this is highly prevalent and only a small proportion of individuals have BE, therefore an endoscopy-based screening strategy to detect BE is unfeasible. Minimally invasive esophageal sampling devices offer an alternative, cost-effective strategy which can be deployed within an at-risk population in a primary care setting to identify individuals with probable BE who can then be referred for endoscopic confirmation.

TFF3 immunohistochemistry has consistently been shown to be a valuable adjunct that increases the accuracy of the CytospongeTM test by highlighting early goblet cells which may be missed on morphological assessment and by allowing pseudogoblet cells to be differentiated from true goblet cells.","Paterson, Anna L; Gehrung, Marcel; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C; O'Donovan, Maria",Diagnostic cytopathology,516,1

Here we demonstrate that an oncogenic mutant form of NPM1 (NPM1c) impairs mitochondrial function. NPM1c also hampers formation of PML nuclear bodies (NBs), which are regulators of mitochondrial fitness and key senescence effectors. Actinomycin D (ActD), an antibiotic with unambiguous clinical efficacy in relapsed/refractory NPM1c-AMLs, targets these primed mitochondria, releasing mtDNA, activating cGAS signaling and boosting ROS production. The latter restore PML NB formation to drive TP53 activation and senescence of NPM1c-AML cells. In several models, dual targeting of mitochondria by venetoclax and ActD synergized to clear AML and prolong survival through targeting of PML. Our studies reveal an unexpected role for mitochondria downstream of NPM1c and implicate a mitochondrial/ROS/PML/TP53 senescence pathway as an effector of ActD-based therapies.","Wu, Hsin-Chieh; Rerolle, Domitille; Berthier, Caroline; Hleihel, Rita; Sakamoto, Takashi; Quentin, Samuel; Benhenda, Shirine; Morganti, Claudia; Wu, Chengchen; Conte, Lidio; Rimsky, Sylvie; Sebert, Marie; Clappier, Emmanuelle; Souquere, Sylvie; Gachet, Stephanie; Soulier, Jean; Durand, Sylvere; Trowbridge, Jennifer J; Benit, Paule; Rustin, Pierre; El Hajj, Hiba; Raffoux, Emmanuel; Ades, Lionel; Itzykson, Raphael; Dombret, Herve; Fenaux, Pierre; Espeli, Olivier; Kroemer, Guido; Brunetti, Lorenzo; Mak, Tak W; Lallemand-Breitenbach, Valerie; Bazarbachi, Ali; Falini, Brunangelo; Ito, Keisuke; Martelli, Maria Paola; de The, Hugues",Cancer discovery,516,1

We evaluated whether SCH affects subsequent live births and whether levothyroxine is effective in improving the live birth rate in patients with RPL. METHOD OF STUDY This observational cohort study included 1418 pregnancies of 1014 patients with a history of 2 or more pregnancy losses, who were euthyroid or had hypothyroidism, and had at least one subsequent pregnancy outcome. Some patients with SCH, as defined as a TSH >2.5mIU/L, were treated with levothyroxine and these comprised the levothyroxine group. The prevalence of SCH, subsequent live birth rates per patient and per pregnancy were compared among patients with SCH treated with and without levothyroxine and patients with euthyroid. RESULTS The prevalence of SCH was 14.4 %. Subsequent live birth rates were 75.0 % for the levothyroxine group, 68.6 % for the untreated SCH group and 70.1 % for the euthyroid group. After excluding miscarriages with abnormal karyotypes, live birth rates were 89.2 %, 90.0 % and 91.1 %. The adjusted odds ratio (95%CI) was 0.95 (0.23-3.83) after controlling covariables when comparing SCH patients with and without treatment. The live birth rates per pregnancy were 93.1%, 85.7% and 90.9%, respectively. The adjusted OR was 0.95 (0.23-3.83). CONCLUSIONS Levothyroxine has no effect on improving the live birth rate in patients with RPL associated with SCH. Treatment in patients with RPL and SCH raised TSH levels (2.5-10mIU/L) might not be beneficial in improving the live birth rate.","Yoshihara, Hiroyuki; Sugiura-Ogasawara, Mayumi; Goto, Shinobu; Kitaori, Tamao",American journal of reproductive immunology,516,25

Most such infections are of viral origin and self-limiting, but viral infection is often hard to distinguish from bacterial infection. The use of a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect viruses in respiratory secretions is potentially beneficial, as it might help physicians avoid giving antibiotics unnecessarily. METHOD This article is based on a selective review of the literature and on the findings of the authors' own investigations. RESULTS Multiplex PCR is a highly sensitive, highly specific test for the detection of viral nucleic acids in respiratory secretions. If PCR reveals the presence of RNA derived from respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, or influenza virus, then an acute infection caused by the corresponding pathogen is probably present, and further treatment can be given accordingly. On the other hand, the nucleic acids of adeno-, boca-, rhino- or coronaviruses can be found in relatively trivial infections as well as in asymptomatic persons, probably reflecting either a prior infection or a current subclinical one. For children in particular, upper respiratory infections are so common in the winter months that acute and prior infections with these pathogens cannot be distinguished by multiplex PCR. The use of multiplex PCR in children has not been shown to shorten hospital stays or to lessen antibiotic consumption or overall cost. CONCLUSION The detectability of viral nucleic acids is an important contribution to the diagnostic assessment of children with severe respiratory infection. For these highly sensitive diagnostic tests to be used optimally, primary viral infections must be distinguished from bacterial superinfections.","Krause, Jens Christian; Panning, Marcus; Hengel, Hartmut; Henneke, Philipp",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,516,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS From December 2010 to May 2012, all patients with an exophytic, solitary, enhancing small (≤4.0 cm) renal mass were chosen to receive the study treatment. A multichannel port provided both a retroperitoneal and transperitoneal approach. A rigid, articulating apparatus was used to perform dissection, exposure of tumor, tissue coagulation, and resection without hilar clamping. Pathologic and hematologic data, subjective evaluation of pain, and scar appearance were analyzed. RESULTS Nonhilar clamp LESS partial nephrectomy by using a microwave tissue coagulator was performed in seven patients (mean operative time, 208 min; mean blood loss, 39 mL; mean renal mass size, 1.7 cm); one procedure with uncontrolled bleeding needed to be converted to conventional laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. No transfusion was necessary. Pathologic investigation demonstrated six renal-cell carcinomas and one oncocytoma. The hemoglobin level decreased by a mean of 1.1 g/dL. Patients did not complain about pain, and they had great satisfaction with the results. The mean duration of hospital stay was 13.8 days. CONCLUSIONS LESS partial nephrectomy without hilar clamping by using a microwave tissue coagulator is possible for renal masses, confers postoperative outcomes comparable to the standard counterpart, and assures patient satisfaction. By use of a microwave tissue coagulator, additional trocars were not necessary, and LESS partial nephrectomy could be accomplished through a single port, which reduced invasion and increased the cosmetic satisfaction of the patients.","Kawai, Noriyasu; Yasui, Takahiro; Umemoto, Yukihiro; Kubota, Yasue; Mizuno, Kentaro; Okada, Atsushi; Ando, Ryosuke; Tozawa, Keiichi; Hayashi, Yutaro; Kohri, Kenjiro",Journal of endourology,516,30

METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted in 1262 participants. The Covid-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S) and Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS) were used to measure outcomes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were constructed to determine risk factors for coronaphobia. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between C19P-S and JSS. RESULTS The following risk factors were found to be associated with coronaphobia: gender, marital status, presence of chronic disease, staying home, and sleep disturbances. Female gender (OR = 2.23 and OR = 2.12), being married (OR = 1.31 and OR = 1.45), chronic disease status (OR = 1.39 and OR = 1.27), staying home (OR = 1.72 and OR = 1.35) and sleep disturbances (OR = 2.63 and OR = 2.49) were found to be associated with the likelihood of having a higher coronaphobia score (p < 0.05). Weak positive correlations were found between C19P-S and its subscales and JSS scores (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Female gender, being married, having chronic diseases, staying home, and having sleep disturbances were found to be risk factors for having high coronaphobia scores. Moreover, the severity of coronaphobia was associated with sleep disturbances. These results should be considered in the management of coronaphobia.","Karaaslan, Yasemin; Mete, Oguzhan; Karadag, Mehmet; Ozer Kaya, Derya; Toprak Celenay, Seyda",Sleep medicine,516,10

We previously investigated the optimal return cannula position; however, the optimal drainage cannula position has not yet been fully clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the optimal drainage cannula position. METHODS: Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed in four adult goats (mean body weight 59.6 ± 0.6 kg). The position of the drainage cannula was varied among the right atrium, the upper inferior vena cava, and the lower inferior vena cava, whereas the position of the return cannula was fixed in the superior vena cava. The recirculation fraction and arterial oxygen saturation and pressure (SaO2, PaO2) were measured in all drainage cannula positions. RESULTS: In the lower inferior vena cava drainage cannula position, the recirculation fraction was the lowest. In the lower inferior vena cava, upper inferior vena cava, and right atrium drainage cannula positions at 3 L/min, SaO2 and PaO2 after 20 min were 92.9% ± 4.9% and 75.1 ± 26.0 mm Hg, 99.5% ± 0.5% and 113.8 ± 20.9 mm Hg, and 93.8% ± 6.2% and 91.9 ± 17.7 mm Hg, respectively. CONCLUSION: With respect to blood oxygenation, the optimal position for the drainage cannula was the upper inferior vena cava. These findings suggested that blood from the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and hepatic vein was most efficiently drained in the upper inferior vena cava cannula position.","Togo, Konomi; Takewa, Yoshiaki; Katagiri, Nobumasa; Fujii, Yutaka; Yamashita, Akihiro C; Tastumi, Eisuke",The International journal of artificial organs,516,33

Trials reporting effect estimates on healthcare appointment attendance and medicine adherence were assessed for risk of bias and included in meta-analyses using random-effects models. Other outcomes were reported descriptively. The protocol is registered in PROSPERO, ID:CRD42018081062. RESULTS We included 38 one-way SMS trials conducted in Africa within a broad range of clinical conditions. Eighteen trials were included in the meta-analyses, and four were assessed as overall low risk of bias.

Several postoperative complications related to the “in situ” distal stomach have been described, and few cases of undetected gastric carcinoma located in this segment of stomach have been published. In this paper, we present our early postoperative results in patients submitted to laparoscopic gastric bypass with resection of distal stomach in patients with morbid obesity. METHODS One hundred twelve consecutive patients were included in this study. The mean body weight was 112.15±5.1 (range 78–145), and BMI was 40.5±6.9 kg/m2 (32.9–50.3). Patients were submitted to resectional gastric bypass by laparoscopic approach. The operative time was 133.7±29.1 min (range 120–240). RESULTS Postoperative complications occurred in 12 patients (10.7%) without any mortality. Early complications were observed in 11 patients while one patient presented a late complication, four patients were re-hospitalized, three of them without operation and other four of them were re-operated due to early (three patients) or late complication (one patient). One hundred patients (89.2%) were discharged at fourth postoperative day, seven patients remained in hospital between 5 and 10 days, and four patients after the tenth day due to complications. Leaks were observed in three patients. The histological study of the resected specimen was normal in only 8.9%. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic resectional gastric bypass presents very similar results compared to classic gastric bypass, without significant increase of morbidity, mortality, early and late postoperative results, and therefore, it is an option for the surgical treatment of morbid obesity in countries with high risk of gastric carcinoma.","Braghetto, Italo; Csendes, Attila; Korn, Owen; Gutierrez, Luis; Brunet, Luis; Lanzarini, Enrique; Mushle, Maher; Valladares, Héctor; Rojas, Jorge",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,516,1

This approach uses mutagenic drugs to increase viral mutation rates and burden viral populations with mutations that reduce the number of infectious progeny. We investigated the effectiveness of lethal mutagenesis as a strategy against influenza virus using three nucleoside analogs, ribavirin, 5-azacytidine, and 5-fluorouracil. All three drugs were active against a panel of seasonal H3N2 and laboratory-adapted H1N1 strains. We found that each drug increased the frequency of mutations in influenza virus populations and decreased the virus' specific infectivity, indicating a mutagenic mode of action. We were able to drive viral populations to extinction by passaging influenza virus in the presence of each drug, indicating that complete lethal mutagenesis of influenza virus populations can be achieved when a sufficient mutational burden is applied. Population-wide resistance to these mutagenic agents did not arise after serial passage of influenza virus populations in sublethal concentrations of drug. Sequencing of these drug-passaged viral populations revealed genome-wide accumulation of mutations at low frequency. The replicative capacity of drug-passaged populations was reduced at higher multiplicities of infection, suggesting the presence of defective interfering particles and a possible barrier to the evolution of resistance. Together, our data suggest that lethal mutagenesis may be a particularly effective therapeutic approach with a high genetic barrier to resistance for influenza virus. IMPORTANCE Influenza virus is an RNA virus that causes significant morbidity and mortality during annual epidemics. Novel therapies for RNA viruses are needed due to the ease with which these viruses evolve resistance to existing therapeutics. Lethal mutagenesis is a broad-spectrum strategy that exploits the high mutation rate and the low mutational tolerance of most RNA viruses. It is thought to possess a higher barrier to resistance than conventional antiviral strategies. We investigated the effectiveness of lethal mutagenesis against influenza virus using three different drugs. We showed that influenza virus was sensitive to lethal mutagenesis by demonstrating that all three drugs induced mutations and led to an increase in the generation of defective viral particles. We also found that it may be difficult for resistance to these drugs to arise at a population-wide level. Our data suggest that lethal mutagenesis may be an attractive anti-influenza strategy that warrants further investigation.","Pauly, Matthew D; Lauring, Adam S",Journal of virology,516,33

An angiogram revealed DAVF with feeders from the right occipital artery and the meningeal branch of the right distal vertebral artery with drainage into the anterior medullary venous system and the perimedullary veins. The patient underwent a successful transarterial endovascular embolization and improved gradually. A brain MRI at 3-month follow-up revealed a residual hyperintense signal on the T2WIs in the left lower medulla. Six cases of patients exhibiting DAVF with isolated unilateral brainstem swelling from the literature were reviewed. Isolated unilateral brainstem swelling due to intracranial DAVF with perimedullary venous drainage is extremely rare and might mimic a tumor on MRI. Abnormal serpentine flow void vessels on the surface of the brainstem or spinal cord are crucial diagnostic clues.","Chen, Pei-Ya; Juan, Yu-Hsiu; Lin, Shinn-Kuang",Journal of Nippon Medical School = Nippon Ika Daigaku zasshi,516,1

The hybrid film exhibits excellent light transmittance, high electrical conductivity, ultra-flexibility, and strong adhesion. These outstanding performances benefit from the filling and adhesion of hydrophilic TCNT layers to the AgNW networks. Besides, we introduced the post-treatment process of mechanical pressing and covering polymer conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS, which obtained three layers of TCNT/AgNW/PEDOT hybrid film and greatly improved the comprehensive properties. The hybrid film can reach a sheet resistance of 9.2 Ω/sq with a transmittance of 83.4% at 550 nm wavelength, and a low root mean square (RMS) roughness (approximately 3.8 nm). After 10000 bends and tape testing, the conductivity and transmittance of the hybrid film remain stable. The resistance of the film has no significant degradation after 14 days of exposure to high temperature of 85 °C and humidity of 85%, indicating excellent stability. The organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with TCNT/AgNW/PEDOT hybrid film as anode exhibit high current density and luminosity, confirming this process has considerable potential application in photovoltaic devices.","Zhu, Ze-Ru; Geng, Wenming; Zhu, Qingxia; Ethiraj, Anita Sagadevan; Wang, Tao; Jing, Li-Chao; Ning, Yu-Jie; Tian, Ying; Geng, Wen-Hao; Wu, Lei; Geng, Hong-Zhang",Nanotechnology,516,1

There is a need to identify social mechanisms underlying the effect of social media on mental health outcomes. Our study breaks new ground by proposing and testing a moderated mediation pathway from social media use to stress in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a two-wave online panel survey in the context of China. With a general basis of the Street's three-stage model, our results indicated that social media failed to directly affect young adults' stress. Instead, fatalism completely mediated this relationship. Also, one's perceived social media exhaustion negatively moderated this mediation pathway. The findings have significant theoretical and practical implications for the use of social media to promote health, well-being, and quality of life among young people during public health crises.","Ngien, Annabel; Jiang, Shaohai",Health communication,516,27

The disease called COVID-19 threatens health and life in patients with comorbid disease, especially in patients with kidney failure. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical findings, laboratory parameters, and prognosis of COVID-19 disease in end-stage renal patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment. METHODS We included the hemodialysis patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 disease and received inpatient treatment between 11.03.2020-24.04.2020 in hospital. The demographic characteristics, comorbidities, symptoms, clinical course, laboratory parameters, and treatments were recorded. FINDINGS The study included 25 hemodialysis patients, 15 (60%) were female. The mean age was 60.5±15 years. All patients had chest computed tomography findings compatible with COVID-19 disease. The findings were bilateral in 88% of patients. The real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test was positive in 48% of the patients. The most common symptoms were dyspnea (56%) and fever (52%). The most common comorbid disease was hypertension (76%). Leukocytosis in 12% of the patients while 72% had lymphopenia. All patients had a high C-reactive protein value. 64% of patients required oxygen support and 32% intensive care. 28% developed a secondary infection. 76% (19/25) of the patients has been discharged with cure and 20% (5/25) died. The inpatient follow-up of a patient (4%) continues. Secondary infection development was significantly associated with oxygen demand (p = 0.027) and need for intensive care (p = 0.001). DISCUSSION The associated clinical symptoms of COVID-19 were similar in hemodialysis patients to those of patients without renal disease. However, it caused pneumonia in all hemodialysis patients. It was associated with a more severe disease and worse prognosis with a mortality rate of 20%. Our study suggests that COVID-19 disease has a significantly more severe course and worse prognosis in hemodialysis patients. This article is protected by copyright.

While the benefits of anaphylaxis-risk prevention are well-known, potential harms resulting from pre-emptive approaches to mitigate anaphylaxis-risk are not insignificant. Still, great progress has been made in recent years to avoid the unintended consequences of anaphylaxis-risk overdiagnosis. Reflection on recent advances in the use of diagnostic testing, as well as the application of diagnostic labels, provides an important perspective to understand how far the specialty of allergy and immunology has come in improving the lives of patients and families. Examples of recent paradigm shifts in anaphylaxis risk management include approaches to peanut allergy prevention without screening, deferral of corticosteroids to prevent biphasic anaphylaxis reactions, re-evaluation of reflex use of emergency medical services for resolved community anaphylaxis, and an approach to penicillin allergy delabeling with direct oral challenge. Routine medical practices to decrease anaphylaxis-risk can have lifelong impacts for patients - beyond just preventing anaphylaxis. As our understanding of these trade-offs evolves it becomes necessary to weigh both the benefits and the harms of past management approaches. Because medicine remains a science of uncertainty and an art of probability, a critical approach to risk mitigation remains necessary to find the often elusive balance in anaphylaxis prevention.","Abrams, Elissa M; Greenhawt, Matthew; Alqurashi, Waleed; Singer, Alexander G; Shaker, Marcus",The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

As part of the host response, sympathetic stimulation can result in septic myocardial depression, and metabolic, haematological and immunological dysfunction. Administration of β-blockers may attenuate this pathophysiological response to infection, but the effects on clinical outcomes are unknown. The objective of this systematic review is to determine the efficacy and safety of β-blockers in adults with sepsis using data from randomised control trials. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will identify randomised control trials comparing treatment with β-blockers, versus placebo or standard care in adults with sepsis. Data sources will include MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, clinical trial registries and conference proceedings. Two reviewers will independently determine trial eligibility. For each included trial, we will conduct duplicate independent data extraction, risk of bias assessment and evaluation of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Our systematic review will evaluate the effects of β-blockers in adults with sepsis, comprehensively summarising and appraising the available evidence from randomised control trials. The results of this systematic review will help clinicians treating patients with sepsis to understand the potential role of β-blockade, and inform future research on this topic.

Following the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there has been an urgent need to develop therapeutic interventions. ACE2 is a potential target for many treatment approaches for the SARS-CoV-2. With the help of bioinformatics, we have predicted several novel exons of the human ACE2 gene. The inclusion of novel exons located in the 5'UTR/intronic region in the mature transcript may remove the critical ACE2 residues responsible for the interaction with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, thus preventing their binding and entry into the cell. Additionally, inclusion of a novel predicted exons located in the 3'UTR by alternative splicing may remove the C-terminal transmembrane domain of ACE2 and generate soluble ACE2 isoforms. Splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (SSOs) have been employed effectively as a therapeutic strategy in several disease conditions. Alternative splicing of the ACE2 gene could similarly be modulated using SSOs to exclude critical domains required for the entry of SARS-CoV-2. Strategies can also be designed to deliver these SSOs directly to the lungs in order to minimize the damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.","Rehman, Sayeed Ur; Tabish, Mohammad",Clinical science,516,1

The aim of the study was to assess feasibility of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) in recurrent varicose veins of the GSV and to compare this technique with conventional surgical reintervention. METHODS Case files of all patients treated for GSV varicosities were evaluated and recurrences selected. Demographics, duplex scan findings, CEAP classification, perioperative data, and follow-up examinations were all registered. A questionnaire focusing on patient satisfaction was administered. RESULTS Sixty-seven limbs were treated with EVLA and 149 were surgically treated. General and regional anesthesia were used more in the surgery group (P < .001). Most complications were minor and self-limiting. Wound infections (8% vs 0%; P < .05) and parasthesia (27% vs 13%; P < .05) were more abundant in the surgery group, whereas the EVLA-treated patients reported more delayed tightness (17% vs 31%; P < .05). Surgically-treated patients suffered less postoperative pain (P < .05) but reported a higher use of analgesics (P < .05). Hospital stay in the surgery group was longer (P < .05) and they reported a longer delay before resuming work (7 vs 2 days; P < .0001). Patient satisfaction was equally high in both groups. At 25 weeks of follow-up, re-recurrences occurred in 29% of the surgically-treated patients and in 19% of the EVLA-treated patients (P = .511). CONCLUSION EVLA is feasible in patients with recurrent varicose veins of the GSV. Complication rates are lower and socioeconomic outcome is better compared to surgical reintervention.","van Groenendael, Laura; van der Vliet, J Adam; Flinkenflögel, Lizel; Roovers, Elisabeth A; van Sterkenburg, Steven M M; Reijnen, Michel M P J",Journal of vascular surgery,516,31

We aimed to assess the associations between body temperature and several adiposity and metabolic markers according to gender and menopausal status in a large population-based sample. METHODS The data collected between 2009 and 2012 from 4224 participants (mean age 57.3 ± 10.4 years, 2225 women) of the CoLaus study (Lausanne, Switzerland). Body temperature was measured at the tympanic membrane. RESULTS Mean body temperature was 36.1 ± 0.4, 36.4 ± 0.4 and 36.3 ± 0.4 °C in men, premenopausal, and postmenopausal women, respectively (p < 0.001). In men and postmenopausal women, body temperature was positively and significantly (p < 0.05) associated with body mass index (Spearman correlation coefficients 0.157 and 0.083, respectively), waist (r = 0.163 and r = 0.104), waist to hip ratio (r = 0.187 and r = 0.132), body area (r = 0.094 and r = 0.085), resting heart rate (r = 0.227 and r = 182), glucose (r = 0.104 and r = 0.088) and insulin (r = 0.148 and r = 0.117). Except for body area and BMI in postmenopausal women, all associations remained significant after multivariable adjustment. In premenopausal women, body temperature was positively associated with resting heart rate (r = 0.140) and insulin (r = 0.170), and no significant associations were found after multivariable adjustment. CONCLUSION Body temperature is strongly associated with obesity markers in men and postmenopausal women. The absence of association in premenopausal women might be due to the influence of the menstrual cycle.","Bastardot, François; Marques-Vidal, Pedro; Vollenweider, Peter",International journal of obesity,516,1

While there is an emerging body of evidence supporting the positive influence of workplace lactation programs on breastfeeding outcomes, there is a lack of literature on the mechanisms underlying those interventions. Aims of this realist review were three-fold: to uncover underlying mechanisms, determine who benefits the most from such interventions and important contextual factors influencing uptake. METHODS Purposive bibliographic searches on Medline, Web of Science Core Collection, CINAHL, Global Health, LILACS, Global Index Medicus, Business Source Complete, Proquest Dissertations and Theses and Open Access Theses and Dissertations were conducted to identify relevant publications. Included publications (qualitative and quantitative) described interventions aiming to improve the breastfeeding behavior of working mothers, that were initiated by the employer, reported on breastfeeding outcomes and had a clearly defined workplace. Publications only focusing on maternity leave or that were not published in English, Spanish, Portuguese or German were excluded. A realist approach was followed to identify how workplace interventions work, who benefits the most and the important contextual factors. RESULTS The bibliographic search yielded a total of 4985 possible publications of which 37 publications were included in the realist analysis. Effective workplace breastfeeding interventions activate three mechanisms: 1) awareness of the intervention, 2) changes in workplace culture, manager/supervisor support, co-worker support and physical environments, and 3) provision of time. Contextual factors such as the distance between the workplace and the infant and the type of workplace may influence the degree of activation of the underlying mechanisms for programs to positively impact breastfeeding outcomes. CONCLUSIONS In order to be effective, workplace breastfeeding interventions need to: raise awareness of the intervention(s) available among working mothers as well as their work environment, change the workplace culture, foster manager/supervisor support and co-workers support, provide enough time and adequate space and facilities for women to breastfeed or express breastmilk during the workday.","Litwan, Kathrin; Tran, Victoria; Nyhan, Kate; Pérez-Escamilla, Rafael",International journal for equity in health,516,1

In this study, we utilized genomes of Xenopus laevis (XLA, a tetraploid species with (L) and (S) sub-genomes) and X. tropicalis (XTR, a diploid species) to investigate whether synonymous substitution rates among orthologous or homoeologous genes displayed any heterogeneity. From over 1500 orthologous/homoeologous genes collected, we calculated proportion of synonymous substitutions between genomes/sub-genomes (k) and found variation within and between chromosomes. Within most chromosomes, we identified higher k with distance from the centromere, likely attributed to higher substitution rates and recombination in these regions. Using maximum likelihood methods, we identified further evidence supporting rate heterogeneity, and estimated species divergence times and ancestral population sizes. Estimated species divergence times (XLA.L-XLA.S: ~25.5 mya; XLA-XTR: ~33.0 mya) were slightly younger compared to a past study, attributed to consideration of population size in our study. Meanwhile, we found very large estimated population size in the ancestral populations of the two species (NA = 2.55 x 106). Local hybridization and population structure, which have not yet been well elucidated in frogs, may be a contributing factor to these possible large population sizes.","Lau, Quintin; Igawa, Takeshi; Ogino, Hajime; Katsura, Yukako; Ikemura, Toshimichi; Satta, Yoko",PloS one,516,10

We test the hypothesis that this has reduced tropospheric and ground-level air pollution concentrations, using satellite data and a network of >10,000 air quality stations. After accounting for the effects of meteorological variability, we find declines in the population-weighted concentration of ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2: 60% with 95% CI 48 to 72%), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5: 31%; 95% CI: 17 to 45%), with marginal increases in ozone (O3: 4%; 95% CI: -2 to 10%) in 34 countries during lockdown dates up until 15 May. Except for ozone, satellite measurements of the troposphere indicate much smaller reductions, highlighting the spatial variability of pollutant anomalies attributable to complex NOx chemistry and long-distance transport of fine particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5). By leveraging Google and Apple mobility data, we find empirical evidence for a link between global vehicle transportation declines and the reduction of ambient NO2 exposure.

Docking of garcinol into the active site of the enzyme was carried out to rationalize the difference in activities between the two compounds. Garcinol showed higher HIV-1-RNase H inhibition than the known inhibitor RDS1759 and retained full potency against the RNase H of a drug-resistant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase form. Isogarcinol was distinctly less active than garcinol, indicating the importance of the enolizable β-diketone moiety of garcinol for anti-RNase H activity. Docking calculations confirmed these findings and suggested this moiety to be involved in the chelation of metal ions of the active site. On the basis of its HIV-1 reverse transcriptase-associated RNase H inhibitory activity, garcinol is worth being further explored concerning its potential as a cost-effective treatment for HIV patients.","Corona, Angela; Seibt, Sebastian; Schaller, David; Schobert, Rainer; Volkamer, Andrea; Biersack, Bernhard; Tramontano, Enzo",Archiv der Pharmazie,516,12

Unlike clinical practice guidelines, a SCAMP is a flexible algorithm that undergoes iterative updates based on periodic data collection and review. We recently implemented a SCAMP for the closed treatment of pediatric torus fractures. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of SCAMP implementation on resource utilization, practice variability, cost of care, and outcomes. METHODS This study was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data on 273 patients with pediatric torus fractures. The pre-SCAMP cohort included 116 subjects from 2008 to 2010. The SCAMP cohort included 157 subjects from 2011 to 2013. The pre-SCAMP cohort was treated according to the judgment of attending fellowship-trained pediatric orthopaedic surgeons. The SCAMP cohort was treated with a standardized algorithm including radiographs and splint application at initial presentation, with a single follow-up at 3 weeks. Patient demographics were analyzed to verify comparability between cohorts. Follow-up data including clinic visits, x-rays and practice variability was recorded. Costing analysis was conducted using time-derived activity-based costing methodology. Outcomes were compared using Poisson regression analysis. Incident rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence limits were estimated. RESULTS No differences in clinical results were observed between the pre-SCAMP and SCAMP cohorts, and all patients demonstrated return to baseline activity at final follow-up. Patient demographics were comparable across cohorts. The SCAMP cohort had a 48% reduction in clinic visits [IRR, 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.44-0.60; P<0.001], 60% reduction in x-rays (IRR, 0.40; CI, 0.33-0.47; P<0.001), and a 23% reduction in x-rays per clinic visit (IRR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65-0.91; P<0.001). Furthermore, SCAMP implementation resulted in a 49% reduction in the overall cost of care. CONCLUSIONS SCAMPs provide a novel alternative to CPGs to implement cost effective changes in Orthopaedic practice.

To protect and maintain the competitive advantage afforded to the Australian goat industry by the absence of many diseases endemic elsewhere, it is important to identify the vulnerability of producers to livestock disease incursions. This study developed a framework of producer vulnerability built from the beliefs and practices of producers that may impact on their likelihood of exposure and response capacity to an emergency animal disease (EAD), using foot and mouth disease as a model. A cross-sectional questionnaire gathered information on producer/enterprise demographics, animal health management and biosecurity practices, with 107 participating in the study. The biosecurity measures that were most commonly implemented by producers were always using animal movement documentation for purchased stock (74.7 %) and isolating new stock (73.1 %). However, moderate to low uptake of biosecurity protocols related to visitors to the property were reported. Response capacity variables such as checking animals daily (72.0 %) and record keeping (91.7 %) were reported by the majority of respondents, with 40.7 % reporting yearly veterinary inspection of their animals. Using the vulnerability framework, a Bayesian Network model was developed and populated by the survey data, and the relationships between variables were investigated. Six vulnerability profiles were developed, with three levels of exposure (high, moderate, low) and two levels of response capacity (high, low), as described by producer demographics and practices. The most sensitive exposure variables on producer vulnerability included implementation of visitor biosecurity and control of feral animals. Results from this study can inform risk based perspectives and decisions around biosecurity and surveillance resource allocation within the goat industry. The results also highlight opportunities for improving Australia's preparedness for a future EAD incursion by considering producer behaviour and beliefs by applying a vulnerability framework.","Manyweathers, Jennifer; Maru, Yiheyis; Hayes, Lynne; Loechel, Barton; Kruger, Heleen; Mankad, Aditi; Xie, Gang; Woodgate, Rob; Hernandez-Jover, Marta",Preventive veterinary medicine,516,26

MATERIAL AND METHODS Nose and throat swabs were used to obtain samples. The samples were analyzed in the National Influenza Center, Department of Influenza Research at the National Institute of Public Health-National Institute of Hygiene as well as in 16 Voivodship Sanitary Epidemiological Stations across the country. Methods of RNA isolation depended on the laboratory where the isolation was performed. In all laboratories, quantitative polymerase chain reactions were used to determine the influenza virus type as well as the subtype. RESULTS The study group was confirmed to be infected with influenza A and B, with influenza A/H1N1/pdm09 as the dominant subtype. Among the age group of children up to 14 years of age, cases of infection with viruses that cause influenza-like disease were also reported. It was noticeable that the largest number of confirmed cases of infection was recorded in the group of the youngest children (0-4 years). In addition, several different variants of co-infection were registered. CONCLUSIONS This population study showed that in the 2018-2019 epidemic season in Poland children aged under 14 years were at risk of influenza virus infection and its complications. The presented data support increasing the percentage of children being vaccinated in Poland.","Kondratiuk, Katarzyna; Hallmann, Ewelina; Łuniewska, Katarzyna; Szymański, Karol; Brydak, Lidia",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,516,1

The prevalence and prognostic impact of dysnatremia in COVID-19 is inconclusive. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence and outcome of dysnatremia in COVID-19. DESIGN The prospective, observational, cohort study included consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 triaged to a Swiss Emergency Department between March and July 2020. METHODS Collected data included clinical, laboratory and disease severity scoring parameters on admission. COVID-19 cases were identified based on a positive nasopharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2, patients with a negative swab test served as controls. The primary analysis was to assess the prognostic impact of dysnatremia on 30-day mortality using a cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS 172 (17%) cases with COVID-19 and 849 (83%) controls were included. Patients with COVID-19 showed a higher prevalence of hyponatremia compared to controls (28.1% vs. 17.5%, p<0.001); while comparable for hypernatremia (2.9% vs 2.1%, p=0.34). In COVID-19 but not in controls, hyponatremia was associated with a higher 30-day mortality (HR 1.4, 95%-CI 1.10-16.62, p=0.05). In both groups, hypernatremia on admission was associated with higher 30-day mortality (COVID-19: HR 11.5, 95%-CI 5.00-26.43, p<0.001; controls: HR 5.3, 95%-CI 1.60-17.64, p=0.006). In both groups, hyponatremia and hypernatremia were significantly associated with adverse outcome, e.g. intensive care unit admission, longer hospitalization, and mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION Our results underline the importance of dysnatremia as predictive marker in COVID-19. Treating physicians should be aware and appropriate treatment measures taken in patients with COVID-19 and dysnatremia.","Atila, Cihan; Sailer, Clara O; Bassetti, Stefano; Tschudin-Sutter, Sarah; Bingisser, Roland; Siegemund, Martin; Osswald, Stefan; Rentsch, Katharina; Rüegg, Marco; Schaerli, Sabrina; Kuster, Gabriela M; Twerenbold, Raphael; Christ-Crain, Mirjam",European journal of endocrinology,516,1

We carried out the first study to investigate the migration pattern and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV genome epidemiology in Chinese horseshoe bats during a 4-year period. Of 1,401 Chinese horseshoe bats from Hong Kong and Guangdong, China, that were sampled, SARSr-Rh-BatCoV was detected in alimentary specimens from 130 (9.3%) bats, with peak activity during spring. A tagging exercise of 511 bats showed migration distances from 1.86 to 17 km. Bats carrying SARSr-Rh-BatCoV appeared healthy, with viral clearance occurring between 2 weeks and 4 months. However, lower body weights were observed in bats positive for SARSr-Rh-BatCoV, but not Rh-BatCoV HKU2. Complete genome sequencing of 10 SARSr-Rh-BatCoV strains showed frequent recombination between different strains. Moreover, recombination was detected between SARSr-Rh-BatCoV Rp3 from Guangxi, China, and Rf1 from Hubei, China, in the possible generation of civet SARSr-CoV SZ3, with a breakpoint at the nsp16/spike region. Molecular clock analysis showed that SARSr-CoVs were newly emerged viruses with the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) at 1972, which diverged between civet and bat strains in 1995. The present data suggest that SARSr-Rh-BatCoV causes acute, self-limiting infection in horseshoe bats, which serve as a reservoir for recombination between strains from different geographical locations within reachable foraging range. Civet SARSr-CoV is likely a recombinant virus arising from SARSr-CoV strains closely related to SARSr-Rh-BatCoV Rp3 and Rf1. Such frequent recombination, coupled with rapid evolution especially in ORF7b/ORF8 region, in these animals may have accounted for the cross-species transmission and emergence of SARS.","Lau, Susanna K P; Li, Kenneth S M; Huang, Yi; Shek, Chung-Tong; Tse, Herman; Wang, Ming; Choi, Garnet K Y; Xu, Huifang; Lam, Carol S F; Guo, Rongtong; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Woo, Patrick C Y; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of virology,516,1

Our aim is to evaluate a standardized technique of LRH and determine variances in performance. METHODS The procedure was deconstructed into 7 major step-wise components. All LRH followed the same surgical sequence, and used the same devices and operating room set-up. Thirty randomly selected video recordings of the procedure underwent intraoperative time analysis. The variances measured by standard deviation of each step were calculated (mean in minutes ± standard deviation). RESULTS Mean total operative time was 114 ± 25 min. The steps with the least variance were inferior vena cava dissection (8 ± 3) and right hepatic vein ligation (9 ± 5). The longest and also the step with the greatest variance was parenchymal transection (35 ± 12). CONCLUSIONS LRH can be performed consistently using a standardized step-wise technique. Parenchymal transection had most variation, and this could be explained by intrinsic liver factors. Surgical performance improvement should begin with deconstructing the operation into definable steps to identify areas for change.","Toro, Juan P; Patel, Ankit D; Lytle, Nathaniel W; Sweeney, John F; Medbery, Rachel L; Scott Davis, Steven; Lin, Edward; Sarmiento, Juan M",American journal of surgery,516,13

MethodsSurrogate clinical specimens were prepared by inoculating foam and polyester nasal swabs with residual SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens diluted in porcine or human matrix. Dry swab elution with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was evaluated by vortex, swab swirling, and passive methodologies. Surrogate and clinical nasal specimen stability were evaluated at refrigerated (4{degrees}C) and elevated temperatures (40{degrees}C for 12 hours, 32{degrees}C hold) through 72 hours. ResultsPolyester swabs demonstrated equivalent performance to foam swabs for detection of low and high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. Dry swab elution performed with PBS and mechanical disruption by vortex resulted in nearly complete quantitative recovery of virus. Dry polyester and foam surrogate specimens were stable through 72 hours both when refrigerated and after high temperature excursion, which simulated specimen transport without cold chain. Similarly, clinical specimens collected with polyester swabs and stored dry were stable through 72 hours in the presence and absence of cold chain. Polyester surrogate specimens stored in saline were stable through 72 hours refrigerated but only through 48 hours at elevated temperatures.

The metric depends on the expected mortality level, which can differ based on given choices, such as the method and the time series length used to estimate the baseline. However, these choices are often arbitrary, and are not subject to any sensitivity analysis. We bring to light the importance of carefully choosing the inputs and methods used to estimate excess mortality. Drawing on data from 26 countries, we investigate how sensitive excess mortality is to the choice of the mortality index, the number of years included in the reference period, the method, and the time unit of the death series. We employ two mortality indices, three reference periods, two data time units, and four methods for estimating the baseline. We show that excess mortality estimates can vary substantially when these factors are changed, and that the largest variations stem from the choice of the mortality index and the method. We also find that the magnitude of the variation in excess mortality can change markedly within countries, resulting in different cross-country rankings. We conclude that the inputs and method used to estimate excess mortality should be chosen carefully based on the specific research question.","Nepomuceno, M. R.; Klimkin, I.; Jdanov, D.

METHODS 59 critically ill patients with ARDS caused by SARS between March and July 2003 were studied prospectively and followed up for 1 year. Thirty-six underwent pulmonary function testing and a 6-minute walk test, and 35 underwent HRQoL evaluation by Short Form-36 questionnaire at 3, 6, and 12 months after illness onset. RESULTS Mean age was 47 (SD, 15.7) years. Median APACHE II score was 10 (interquartile range [IQR], 7-12). Only 47% required invasive mechanical ventilation. Median admission and worst PaO2/FIO2 ratio were 142 (IQR, 94-177) mmHg and 86 (IQR, 66-122) mmHg, respectively. Median stay in ICU and hospital were 9 (IQR, 5-20) and 31 (IQR, 20-54) days, respectively. Mortality was 24% at hospital discharge and at 1 year. Mean lung volumes and spirometric measurements were nearly normal by 6 months. Except for diffusion capacity adjusted for haemoglobin concentration (DLCO) measured at 12 months, there was no significant difference in pulmonary function measurement between those who had mechanical ventilation and those who did not. The 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) improved from 3 to 6 months, with no further significant change. Younger patients had near normal HRQoL by 6 months. Those aged over 40 years had impaired HRQoL at multiple domains even at 12 months. At 12 months, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, forced vital capacity and 6MWD correlated significantly with multiple SF-36 domain scores. DLCO correlated significantly only with domain scores reflecting physical function. CONCLUSIONS The mortality of SARS-related ARDS is similar to the mortality of ARDS from other causes.

Infection with the A59 strain of MHV induces both encephalitis and hepatitis, while the highly neurovirulent JHM strain induces a fatal encephalitis with little, if any, hepatitis. The pathogenic phenotype for each strain is determined by the genetic composition of the viral genome, as well as the host immune response. Using isogenic recombinant viruses with A59 background genes differing only in the spike gene, we have previously shown that high neurovirulence is associated with the JHM spike protein, the protein responsible for attachment to the host cell receptor (J. J. Phillips, M. M. Chua, G. F. Rall, and S. R. Weiss, Virology 301:109-120, 2002). Using another set of isogenic recombinant viruses with JHM background genes expressing either the JHM or A59 spike, we have further investigated the roles of viral genes in pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that the high neurovirulence of JHM is associated with accelerated spread through the brain and a heightened innate immune response that is characterized by high numbers of infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages, suggesting an immunopathogenic component to neurovirulence. While expression of the JHM spike is sufficient to confer a neurovirulent phenotype, as well as increased macrophage infiltration, background genes contribute to virulence as well, at least in part, by dictating the extent of the T-cell immune response.","Iacono, Kathryn T; Kazi, Lubna; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,516,24

Finally, three levels of healthcare worker competencies in the HEICS are suggested: (1) basic understanding of the HEICS for all hospital healthcare workers; (2) advanced understanding and proficiency in the HEICS for hospital healthcare workers likely to assume leadership roles in hospital emergency response; and (3) special proficiency in constituting the HEICS ad hoc from existing healthcare workers in resource-deficient settings.

Important questions remain on the contribution of hMPV to ARIs and its impact on public health. During the 2001-2002 season, we conducted a collaborative study with four provincial public health laboratories to study the prevalence of this new virus in the Canadian population. A total of 445 specimens were collected from patients of all age groups with ARIs and were tested for the presence of hMPV by reverse transcription-PCR. Of these, 66 (14.8%) tested positive for hMPV. Positive specimens were found in all age groups and in all four provinces studied. Virus activity peaked in February and March. The age range of the patients with hMPV infection was 2 months to 93 years (median age, 25 years), with similar numbers of females (35%) and males (41%). Thirty-three percent (n = 22) of hMPV-infected patients were hospitalized; of these, 27% (n = 6) had rhinitis and pneumonia, 23% (n = 5) had bronchiolitis, and 9% (n = 2) had bronchitis. The hospitalization rates were significantly higher among patients <5 years of age (P = 0.0005) and those >50 years of age (P = 0.0044) than among those 6 to 50 years of age. Phylogenetic analysis of the F gene showed that two hMPV genetic clusters were cocirculating in the 2001-2002 season, and comparison with earlier studies suggests a temporal evolutionary pattern of hMPV isolates. These results provide further evidence of the importance of hMPV in ARIs, particularly in young children and elderly individuals.","Bastien, Nathalie; Ward, Diane; Van Caeseele, Paul; Brandt, Ken; Lee, Spencer H S; McNabb, Gail; Klisko, Brian; Chan, Edward; Li, Yan",Journal of clinical microbiology,516,28

SUMMARY Hospitals and clinics are adopting the methods of high-reliability organizations to identify and change ineffective practice patterns. Although systems issues are emphasized in patient safety, people are critically important to effective teamwork and leadership. Advancements in procedural and cosmetic dermatology, organizational and clinical guidelines, and the revolution in information technology and electronic health records have introduced new sources of potential error.

This obstetric complication is very rare but characterized by high mortality rate. The main symptoms are dyspnea, cardiovascular collapse, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and even sudden cardiac death. The aim of the article is to draw attention to AFE as a rare but possible and catastrophic complication of perinatal period. The authors present a 28-year-old woman who was admitted to obstetric ward during the first stage of labour. The patient developed sudden deterioration of her medical state with acute respiratory distress symptoms. An emergency cesarean section was performed, complicated by excessive bleeding. After a detailed assessment of the patient's condition and evaluation of the results of additional tests, we diagnosed AFE as the cause of the patient's deterioration. CONCLUSION Conclusions: The case study shows how unpredictable, unpreventable and dangerous is AFE. It is still one of the main causes of maternal deaths in developed countries. Four diagnostic criteria proposed by the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) may accelerate diagnosis. AFE as a medical emergency, requires immediate multidisciplinary response and aggressive treatment. The initial medical care may be facilitated by the application of the general guidelines recommended by SMFM. The case report also emphasizes the need for further research on this disease, in particular on early detection and prevention.","Jermakow, Mateusz; Palus, Agnieszka; Ciurzyński, Michał; Pietrzak, Bronisława; Kurnicka, Katarzyna; Pruszczyk, Piotr; Bienias, Piotr",Wiadomosci lekarskie,516,17

RECENT FINDINGS In the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), many patients had abnormalities in liver function tests. Liver biopsy findings in three cases were reported that showed a generic picture of hepatitis, with exceptionally increased mitotic activity. The role of portal myofibroblasts in cirrhosis was examined in several studies. A newly described lesion, isolated ductular hyperplasia (IDH) was found in patients with prolonged abnormalities of liver function tests of uncertain origin. Hyperplastic, well-differentiated bile ductules were seen on liver biopsy in the absence of any identifiable biliary disease. Hereditary hemochromatosis is now a complex entity with various clinicopathological forms based on mutations in the HFE gene and other iron-homeostatic genes such as transferrin receptor 2 and ferroportin 1. In some of these heritable forms of primary iron overload, stainable iron is present in both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. After liver transplantation, differentiating recurrent HCV infection from acute rejection on liver biopsy is problematic, with exceptionally low inter- and intra-observer reliability shown in one study.

Some adolescents might be particularly vulnerable in this situation, including those who are deprived of psychological, social or health care services and/or are exposed to abuse or neglect in their home environment. The aims of the current international multicentre follow-up study are to: 1. collect data on the mental health and quality of life of adolescents during and after the pandemic; 2. improve their mental health by providing an online prevention program that addresses their actual needs; 3. accelerate the development of culturally adapted prevention programs by involving an international team, and 4. to contribute to adequate preparation for any potentially occurring, similar situationin the future. METHODS Participants aged 11-18 years and their parents/caregivers from diff erent parts of Europe and non-European countries are recruited online. Data are collected regularly in a follow-up study by means of structured self-administered online questionnaires on adolescents' mental health, quality of life and current attitudes and needs. The baseline data collection was in March 2020 at first restrictions of the COVID pandemic in Europe. It is followed up several times (at the beginning weekly, later monthly, bi-monthly, three-monthly) to study changes in mental health, quality of life and attitudes of children and adolescents during the coronavirus disease pandemic. Data were collected by means of structured questionnaires (see below). The time frame of the study is set to one year from study start, March 2021. The last data collection was done in December 2020. The prevention program is developed and provided based on continuously analysed incoming data. CONCLUSIONS Prevention based on the results of the study is expected to contribute to maintaining adolescents' mental health, improve their quality of life, increase their and their environment's cooperation with the necessary restrictions during the pandemic, and to make reintegration easier once the restrictions are over. Furthermore, the study has the potential to inform on the wellbeing of children and adolescents in extreme situations in general, thus contribute to future preventive measures and policymaking. Implications and Contribution: The proposed international online follow-up study is expected to provide scientifi c evidence for 1. possible changes in the mental health and quality of life of adolescents during and after a pandemic situation, 2. the eff ectiveness of a culturally adapted prevention program developed to address challenges associated with these changes.","Szentiványi, Dora; Horvath, Lili Olga; Kjeldsen, Anne; L Buist, Kirsten; Farkas, Bernadett Frida; Ferenczi-Dallos, Gyongyver; Garas, Peter; Gyori, Dora; Gyorfi, Agnes; Gyorfi, Dora; Ravens-Sieberer, Ulrike; Balazs, Judit",Neuropsychopharmacologia Hungarica : a Magyar Pszichofarmakologiai Egyesulet lapja = official journal of the Hungarian Association of Psychopharmacology,516,17

The recent Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) study demonstrated a high incidence of perioperative complications (15%) for treatment of ICAD with stenting. Although the incidence of stroke was lower in the medical arm, recurrent stroke was found in 12% of patients despite aggressive medical management, suggesting that intervention may remain a viable option for ICAD if perioperative risk is minimized. Angioplasty without stenting represents an alternative and understudied revascularization treatment for ICAD. Submaximal angioplasty limits the risks of thromboembolism, vessel perforation, and reperfusion hemorrhage that were frequently reported with stenting in the SAMMPRIS trial. The authors conducted a prospective Phase I trial designed to assess the safety of submaximal angioplasty in patients with symptomatic ICAD. METHODS This study was approved by the local institutional review board. Demographic and clinical data were prospectively collected. Angioplasty was performed with a balloon undersized to approximately 50%-70% of the nondiseased vessel diameter in patients with symptomatic ICAD who had angiographically significant stenosis of ≥ 70%. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of periprocedural complications (combined rate of death, stroke, and hemorrhage occurring within 30 days and at 1 year). RESULTS Among the 65 patients with symptomatic ICAD who were screened, 24 had significant angiographic stenosis that met the inclusion criteria of this study. The mean age was 64.08 years (median 65 years; SD ± 11.24 years), most were men (62.5%), and most were white (66.67%). Many patients had concomitants of vascular disease, including hypertension (95.8%), hyperlipidemia (70.83%), smoking history (54.1%), and diabetes mellitus (50.0%). Coronary artery disease (41.66%) and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (45.83%) were frequently present. Most patients (75%) had anterior circulation stenosis. The mean preprocedure stenosis was 80.16% (median 80%, range 70%-95%). Submaximal angioplasty was performed in patients who met the inclusion criteria, with a mean postangioplasty stenosis rate of 54.62% (median 55.5%, range 31%-78%). Rates of ischemic stroke in the territory of the treated artery were 0% within 30 days and 5.55% (in the only patient who presented with recurrent stroke) at 1 year. The mortality and hemorrhage rates in this series were 0%. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the safety of the submaximal angioplasty technique, with no permanent periprocedural complications in 24 treated patients.","Dumont, Travis M; Sonig, Ashish; Mokin, Maxim; Eller, Jorge L; Sorkin, Grant C; Snyder, Kenneth V; Hopkins, L Nelson; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurosurgery,516,17

Here we demonstrate that the spike (S) protein from the group 3 coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) contains a canonical dilysine endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal (-KKXX-COOH) in its cytoplasmic tail. This signal can retain a chimeric reporter protein in the ERGIC and when mutated allows transport of the full-length S protein as well as the chimera to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the IBV S protein also contains a tyrosine-based endocytosis signal in its cytoplasmic tail, suggesting that any S protein that escapes the ERGIC will be rapidly endocytosed when it reaches the plasma membrane. We also identified a novel dibasic motif (-KXHXX-COOH) in the cytoplasmic tails of S proteins from group 1 coronaviruses and from the newly identified coronavirus implicated in severe acute respiratory syndrome. This dibasic motif also retained a reporter protein in the ERGIC, similar to the dilysine motif in IBV S. The cytoplasmic tails of S proteins from group 2 coronaviruses lack an intracellular localization signal. The inherent differences in S-protein trafficking could point to interesting variations in pathogenesis of coronaviruses, since increased levels of surface S protein could promote syncytium formation and direct cell-to-cell spread of the infection.","Lontok, Erik; Corse, Emily; Machamer, Carolyn E",Journal of virology,516,12

Contact tracing is the process by which public-health officials identify people, or contacts, who have been exposed to a person infected with a pathogen or another hazard. For all its power, though, contact tracing yields a variable level of success. One reason is that contact tracing's ability to break the chain of transmission is only as effective as the proportion of contacts who are actually traced. In part, this proportion turns on the quality of the information that infected people provide, which makes human memory a crucial part of the efficacy of contact tracing. Yet the fallibilities of memory, and the challenges associated with gathering reliable information from memory, have been grossly underestimated by those charged with gathering it.

This study was aimed to compare the epidemiological characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in diabetic versus non-diabetic individuals. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, the epidemiological characteristics of the two groups of diabetic (n=1365) and non-diabetic (n=15,026) subjects with definite diagnosis of COVID-19 in the southwestern region of Iran were compared. All clinical signs and comorbidities of the patients were evaluated. Chi-square test was used to examine the differences in qualitative variables between diabetic and non-diabetic groups. Results: Of 16,391 enrolled subjects, 8.3% had diabetes, and 28.3% of COVID-19-related deaths occurred in diabetics. Also, the mortality rate among diabetics was reported as 14.3%. The average age of diabetic patients and non-diabetic patients was 59 and 37 years, respectively. The odds of fever, cough, shortness of breath, headache, and underlying diseases, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, immune deficiency, and hyperlipidemia, were significantly higher in diabetic patients than in non-diabetics. Conclusion: Diabetes is associated with increased mortality rate in patients with COVID-19 and is considered as a major risk factor for COVID-19 infection, posing a major public health challenge for health policymakers in managing and controlling the disease. Therefore, development of prevention and treatment strategies aimed at reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in diabetes patients is of significant importance.","Moftakhar, Leila; Moftakhar, Parisa; Piraee, Elahe; Ghaem, Haleh; Valipour, Aliasghar; Azarbakhsh, Habibollah",Int J Diabetes Dev Ctries,516,2

Research over the past decade has added further to our understanding of the role of prenatal infection in schizophrenia risk. These investigations include several well-powered designs, and like some earlier studies, measured maternal antibodies to specific infectious agents in stored serum samples and large registers to identify clinically diagnosed infections during pregnancy. Convergent findings from antibody studies suggest that prenatal maternal infection with Toxoplasma gondii is associated with increased schizophrenia risk in the offspring, while associations with HSV-2 infection are likely attributable to confounding. Maternal influenza infection remains a viable candidate for schizophrenia, based on an early serological study, though there has been only one attempt to replicate this finding, with a differing methodology. A prior association between maternal serologically confirmed cytomegalovirus infections require further study. Clinically diagnosed maternal infection, particularly bacterial infection, also appears to be associated with increased risk of offspring schizophrenia, and heterogeneity in these findings is likely due to methodological differences between studies. Further clarification may be provided by future studies that address the timing, type, and clinical features of infections. Important insight may be gained by examining the long-term offspring outcomes in emerging epidemics such as Zika virus and COVID-19, and by investigating the interaction between exposure to prenatal infection and other risk or protective factors.","Cheslack-Postava, Keely; Brown, Alan S",Schizophr. res,516,21

It is, however, so far unclear how patients with a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) perceive their individual COVID-19 risk. Moreover, their worries and preventive behaviors and their associations with risk perception are unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A postal survey was conducted in April 2020, including participants with previous PE from the German ""Lungenembolie Augsburg"" (LEA) cohort study. The questionnaire contained items on COVID-19 knowledge, risk perception (infection likelihood, susceptibility, dangerousness), information sources and satisfaction with information, individual assignment to a high risk group due to pre-existing conditions, worries, infection likelihood, and implementation of preventive behaviors. RESULTS: From the 185 respondents, 71.7% assigned themselves to a high risk group in terms of developing a severe case of COVID-19. The likelihood of being infected was rated as verylow/low by 82.3% and the susceptability by 37.8%. A considerable percentage of patients expected a very high/high infection risk in a hospital (48.3%) or at a doctor's practice (37.9%). Major sources of information were the patients' general practitioners (48.9%) and the internet (31.5%). Assignment to a high risk group (ß = 1.04) and uncertainty in terms of assignment (ß = 1.26) were significantly (p = 0.01) associated with a higher level of health-related worries. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with previous PE feel that they belong to a high risk group in terms of severe illness from COVID-19.

Patients with thoracic malignancies are thought to be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 given their older age, smoking habits, and pre-existing cardiopulmonary comorbidities, in addition to cancer treatments. We aimed to study the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on patients with thoracic malignancies. METHODS: The Thoracic Cancers International COVID-19 Collaboration (TERAVOLT) registry is a multicentre observational study composed of a cross-sectional component and a longitudinal cohort component. Eligibility criteria were the presence of any thoracic cancer (non-small-cell lung cancer [NSCLC], small-cell lung cancer, mesothelioma, thymic epithelial tumours, and other pulmonary neuroendocrine neoplasms) and a COVID-19 diagnosis, either laboratory confirmed with RT-PCR, suspected with symptoms and contacts, or radiologically suspected cases with lung imaging features consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia and symptoms. Patients of any age, sex, histology, or stage were considered eligible, including those in active treatment and clinical follow-up. Clinical data were extracted from medical records of consecutive patients from Jan 1, 2020, and will be collected until the end of pandemic declared by WHO. Data on demographics, oncological history and comorbidities, COVID-19 diagnosis, and course of illness and clinical outcomes were collected. Associations between demographic or clinical characteristics and outcomes were measured with odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs using univariable and multivariable logistic regression, with sex, age, smoking status, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease included in multivariable analysis. This is a preliminary analysis of the first 200 patients. The registry continues to accept new sites and patient data. FINDINGS: Between March 26 and April 12, 2020, 200 patients with COVID-19 and thoracic cancers from eight countries were identified and included in the TERAVOLT registry; median age was 68·0 years (61·8-75·0) and the majority had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 (142 [72%] of 196 patients), were current or former smokers (159 [81%] of 196), had non-small-cell lung cancer (151 [76%] of 200), and were on therapy at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis (147 [74%] of 199), with 112 (57%) of 197 on first-line treatment. 152 (76%) patients were hospitalised and 66 (33%) died. 13 (10%) of 134 patients who met criteria for ICU admission were admitted to ICU; the remaining 121 were hospitalised, but were not admitted to ICU. Univariable analyses revealed that being older than 65 years (OR 1·88, 95% 1·00-3·62), being a current or former smoker (4·24, 1·70-12·95), receiving treatment with chemotherapy alone (2·54, 1·09-6·11), and the presence of any comorbidities (2·65, 1·09-7·46) were associated with increased risk of death. However, in multivariable analysis, only smoking history (OR 3·18, 95% CI 1·11-9·06) was associated with increased risk of death. INTERPRETATION: With an ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, our data suggest high mortality and low admission to intensive care in patients with thoracic cancer. Whether mortality could be reduced with treatment in intensive care remains to be determined. With improved cancer therapeutic options, access to intensive care should be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting based on cancer specific mortality and patients' preference.

Madder roots were used, to produce natural dyes for the green coloration of PET fabrics in both dyeing and printing processes. The color strength (K/S) was measured to study the influence of both plasma gases and the cationization treatment on the coloration of PET fabric.

This scoping review aimed to map the existing literature that examines self-management in people affected by cancer who were post-treatment from rural and urban areas. METHODS: Arksey and O'Malley's framework for conducting a scoping review was utilised. Keyword searches were performed in the following: Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science. Supplementary searching activities were also conducted. RESULTS: A total of 438 articles were initially retrieved and 249 duplicates removed leaving 192 articles that were screened by title, abstract and full text. Nine met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. They were published from 2011 to 2018 and conducted in the USA (n = 6), Australia (n = 2) and Canada (n = 1). None of the studies offered insight into self-managing cancer within a rural-urban context in the UK. Studies used qualitative (n = 4), mixed methods (n = 4) and quantitative designs (n = 1). CONCLUSION: If rural and urban populations define their health in different ways as some of the extant literature suggests, then efforts to support self-management in both populations will need to be better informed by robust evidence given the increasing focus on patient-centred care. It is important to consider if residency can be a predictor of as well as a barrier or facilitator to self-management.","Nelson, David; McGonagle, Ian; Jackson, Christine; Kane, Ros",Support. care cancer,516,20

As a consequence, bike-sharing schemes have been affected partly due to the change in travel demand and behaviour as well as a shift from public transit. This study estimates the varying effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the London bike-sharing system (Santander Cycles) over the period March-December 2020. We employed a Bayesian second-order random walk time-series model to account for temporal correlation in the data. We compared the observed number of cycle hires and hire time with their respective counterfactuals (what would have been if the pandemic had not happened) to estimate the magnitude of the change caused by the pandemic. The results indicated that following a reduction in cycle hires in March and April 2020, the demand rebounded from May 2020, remaining in the expected range of what would have been if the pandemic had not occurred. This could indicate the resiliency of Santander Cycles. With respect to hire time, an important increase occurred in April, May, and June 2020, indicating that bikes were hired for longer trips, perhaps partly due to a shift from public transit.","Heydari, Shahram; Konstantinoudis, Garyfallos; Behsoodi, Abdul Wahid",,516,25

Less common presentations were neurologic problems (33%), and skin desquamation (30%), MIS-C was slightly more prevalent in males (53.7%) compared to females (46.3%). The findings of this meta-analysis on current evidence found that the common clinical presentations of COVID-19 associated MIS-C include a combination of fever and mucocutaneous involvements, similar to atypical Kawasaki disease, and multiple organ dysfunction.

There were 37 patients with CKD, mean age 58.3 ± 14.1 years, admitted to BHN due to COVID-19, and among them, 24 (65.7%) were males (p = 0.016).

In the entire cohort, the majority of patients presented with bilateral pneumonia, and the most common symptoms at admission were dyspnea, cough, and fever. Serum levels of D-dimer, ferritin and procalcitonin were significantly higher in patients with CKD compared with those without CKD. Multivariate analysis revealed that CKD, age (>60 years), and hypoxia measured in the ER were factors associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Among patients with CKD but not in those without CKD (OR 36.8, CI 1.5-88.3, p = 0.026), an increased monocytes-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) was associated with higher mortality and remained statistically significant after adjusting for confounders. The MLR measured in the ER may be useful for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with CKD and COVID-19 and could contribute to early risk stratification in this group.","Dávila-Collado, Ramsés; Jarquín-Durán, Oscar; Solís-Vallejo, Andrés; Nguyen, Mai Anh; Espinoza, J Luis",,516,1

ACE2 serves as a molecular target for the SARS-CoV-2, to enter the target cell, by interacting with the viral glycoprotein spikes. However, the complexity began when numerous studies identified the protective response of ACE2 in abbreviating the harmful effects of vasoconstrictor, anti-inflammatory peptide, angiotensin 2, by mediating its conversion to angiotensin-(1-7), which exercised antagonistic actions to angiotensin 2. Furthermore, certain investigations revealed greater resistance among children as compared to the geriatrics, towards COVID-19 infection, despite the elevated expression of ACE2 in pediatric population. Based upon such evidences, the review demonstrated possible therapeutic interventions, targeting both the protective and deleterious effects of ACE2 in COVID-19 disease, primarily inhibiting ACE2-virus interactions or administering soluble ACE2. Thus, the authors aim to provide an opportunity for the researchers to consider RAAS system to be a significant element in development of suitable treatment regime for COVID-19 pandemic.","Behl, Tapan; Kaur, Ishnoor; Bungau, Simona; Kumar, Arun; Uddin, Md Sahab; Kumar, Chanchal; Pal, Giridhari; Shrivastava, Kamal; Zengin, Gokhan; Arora, Sandeep",Life Sci,516,22

This study evaluated two candidate SACs for this purpose. One detected representative oral microbiota (Streptococcus species DNA) and the other, human cells (human mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays for the two target cell types were applied to buccal swabs (representing samples collected within the oral cavity) and hand swabs (representing improperly collected samples) obtained from 51 healthy U.S. volunteers. Quantification cycle (Cq) cutoffs that maximized Youden's index were established for each assay. The streptococcal target at a Cq cutoff of &#8804;34.9 had 99.0% sensitivity and specificity for oral swab samples, whereas human mtDNA perfectly distinguished between hand and mouth swabs with a Cq cutoff of 31.3. The human mtDNA test was then applied to buccal, tongue, and gum swabs that had previously been collected from TB patients and controls in South Africa, along with ""air swabs"" collected as negative controls (total N = 292 swabs from 71 subjects). Of these swabs, 287/292 (98%) exhibited the expected Cq values. In a paired analysis the three oral sites yielded indistinguishable amounts of human mtDNA, however PurFlockTM swabs collected slightly more human mtDNA than did OmniSwabsTM (p = 0.012). The results indicate that quantification of human mtDNA cannot distinguish swabs collected from different sites within the mouth. However, it can reliably distinguish oral swabs from swabs that were not used orally, which makes it a useful SAC for oral swab-based diagnosis.","Deviaene, Meagan; Weigel, Kris M; Wood, Rachel C; Luabeya, Angelique K K; Jones-Engel, Lisa; Hatherill, Mark; Cangelosi, Gerard A",PLoS One,516,26

John Hunter (1728-1793), in a letter to Edward Jenner. August 2nd, 1775. When Galen of Pergamum (2nd c. A.D.), physician, philosopher and experimentalist, sought to ascertain the therapeutic properties of Theriac, an antidote of repute against poisons, he resorted to an experiment. Theriac or Theriaca was a compound drug, containing in some versions used in antiquity numerous components; Galen's own composition included over 70 ingredients! One of its uses was as an antidote against snakebites, a frequent peril for the Roman armies marching on in sandals. Galen spent most of his life in Rome and was elevated to Imperial Physician at the court of Marcus Aurelius, who apparently took daily doses of Theriac, which among other components included opium. Describing the experiment to his friend Pison, Galen wrote, ""as I could not possibly conduct a trial on humans, I experimented on roosters"" For his experiment, Galen, studied two groups of roosters, but he doesn't tell us how many animals he included in each category. Both groups were exposed to poisonous snakebites. All roosters who were fed with theriac prior to exposure to viper bites survived, whereas in the second group that had not received prophylactic Theriac, all roosters died. Not only is Galen's methodology remarkable, preceding the modern randomised trial by eighteen centuries, but more importantly, it is notable for his ethical stance at a time when sensitivities about human rights, prevalent in our times, were largely absent in societies of widespread slavery. For example, Mithridates VI (132-63 BC), the King of Pontus who is credited with the first use of Theriac, tested its efficacy on criminals and slaves.

By April 26, 2021, Delphi-Facebook and Census Household Pulse estimated that at least 73% and 69% of US adults had received a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was 16 and 12 percentage points higher, respectively, than the CDC's estimate (57%). Moreover, estimates of vaccine hesitancy disagree significantly between surveys -- we find that these differences cannot be explained entirely by Delphi-Facebook's under-representation of racial minorities and non-college educated adults. These are examples of the Big Data Paradox: when a confidence interval based on a large but biased sample exhibits both a seriously displaced center and a grossly underestimated width, thus leading us (confidently) away from the truth. With sufficient attention to quality control, small surveys like Axios-Ipsos can be far more reliable than large ones. We leverage a recently established data quality identity (Meng, Annals of Applied Statistics, 2018) to quantify sources of the estimation errors and to conduct a scenario analysis for implications on vaccine willingness and hesitancy. Our study quantifies how bias in large samples can lead to overconfidence in incorrect inferences, which is particularly problematic in studies, like those examined here, that inform high-stakes public policy decisions.","Bradley, Valerie C.; Kuriwaki, Shiro; Isakov, Michael; Sejdinovic, Dino; Meng, Xiao-Li; Statistics, Seth Flaxman Department of; Oxford, University of; Science, Department of Political; University, Stanford; College, Harvard; University, Harvard; Statistics, Department of; Mathematics, Department of; London, Imperial College",,516,30

A reflection about its indicators.],18.789253,-0.79355067,2021,"Introduction: Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes play a major role in cancer formation, growth, and progression. One of the important findings in this area is that murine double minute 2 (MDM2) oncogene is a negative regulator of wild-type p53. In tumors, expressing wild-type p53, inhibition of MDM2 expression will stabilize p53 and allow it to perform its proapoptotic function, while simultaneously preventing MDM2 from exerting its p53-independent oncogenic effects. The intracellular levels of p53 are tightly regulated by MDM2, as it is a key player in autoregulatory feedback loop under nonstressed conditions. The p53-MDM2 relationship is vital not only for essential functions of the cell, but it also appears to be an integrated part of the complex cellular network which supports the importance of this affair and is a hallmark for its coexistence. Subjects and Methods: This study was designed to identify immunohistochemically the expression of p53 and MDM2 gene using monoclonal antibody in 60 cases of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, of which 20 cases were of solid multicystic ameloblastoma (SMA), 20 cases were of odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), and 20 cases were of unicystic ameloblastoma (UA). Results: Immunoexpression of p53 and MDM2 was highest in OKC followed by SMA and was minimum in UA. Further results showed positive correlation between both the molecules. Conclusion: The studied showed that the relationship has a significant role in cancer etiology and progression and therefore is an important topic for future research which should help in the development of new therapeutic agent against cancer.","Singh, Abhishek; Jain, Anshi; Shetty, Devi Charan; Rathore, Ajit Singh; Juneja, Saurabh",J Cancer Res Ther,516,26

Data were extracted from clinical and laboratory records. Follow-up was cut off on March 8, 2020.A total of 274 patients, 75 with hypertension and 199 without hypertension, were included in the analysis. Compared with patients without hypertension, patients with hypertension were older and were more likely to have preexisting comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, patients with hypertension tended to have higher positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 PCR detection.

338144,338144,338144,A Virtual Success,18.92538,-0.5709763,2020,"AIM: Psychiatric symptoms are often accompanied by impairments in decision-making to attain rewards and avoid losses. However, due to the complex nature of mental disorders (e.g., high comorbidity), symptoms that are specifically associated with deficits in decision-making remain unidentified. Furthermore, the influence of psychiatric symptoms on computations underpinning reward-seeking and loss-avoidance decision-making remains elusive. Here, we aim to address these issues by leveraging a large-scale online experiment and computational modelling. METHODS: In the online experiment, we recruited 1,900 non-diagnostic participants from the general population. They performed either a reward-seeking or loss-avoidance decision-making task, and subsequently completed questionnaires about psychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: We found that one trans-diagnostic dimension of psychiatric symptoms related to compulsive behaviour and intrusive thought (CIT) was negatively correlated with overall decision-making performance in both the reward-seeking and loss-avoidance tasks. A deeper analysis further revealed that, in both tasks, the CIT psychiatric dimension was associated with lower preference for the options that recently led to better outcomes (i.e., reward or no-loss). On the other hand, in the reward-seeking task only, the CIT dimension was associated with lower preference for recently unchosen options. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that psychiatric symptoms influence the two types of decision-making, reward-seeking and loss-avoidance, through both common and distinct computational processes.

Young children, women of reproductive age and pregnant women living in sub-Saharan Africa are the most vulnerable. It is estimated that iron deficiency accounts for half of anaemia cases. Apart from nutritional deficiency, infection, inflammation and genetic factors are the major drivers of anaemia. However, the role of genetic risk factors has not been thoroughly investigated. This is particularly relevant in African populations, as they carry high genetic diversity and have a high prevalence of anaemia. Multiple genetic variations in iron regulatory genes have been linked to impaired iron status. Here we conducted a literature review to identify genetic variants associated with iron imbalance among global populations. We compare their allele frequencies and risk scores and we investigated population-specific selection among populations of varying geographic origin using data from the Keneba Biobank representing individuals in rural Gambia and the 1000 Genomes Project. We identified a significant lack of data on the genetic determinants of iron status in sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the studies on genetic determinants of iron status have been conducted in Europeans. Also, we identified population differences in allele frequencies in candidate putative genetic risk factors. Given the disproportionately high genetic diversity in African populations coupled with their high prevalence of iron deficiency, there is need to investigate the genetic influences of low iron status in Sub-Saharan Africa. The resulting insights may inform the future implementation of iron intervention strategies.","Jallow, Momodou W; Cerami, Carla; Clark, Taane G; Prentice, Andrew M; Campino, Susana",PLoS One,516,6

This disease is diagnosed using radiological images taken with the help of basic scanning methods besides the test kits for Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Automatic analysis of chest Computed Tomography (CT) images that are based on image processing technology plays an important role in combating this infectious disease. Material and methods: In this paper, a new Multiple Kernels-ELM-based Deep Neural Network (MKs-ELM-DNN) method is proposed for the detection of novel coronavirus disease - also known as COVID-19, through chest CT scanning images. In the model proposed, deep features are extracted from CT scan images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For this purpose, pre-trained CNN-based DenseNet201 architecture, which is based on the transfer learning approach is used. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier based on different activation methods is used to calculate the architecture's performance. Lastly, the final class label is determined using the majority voting method for prediction of the results obtained from each architecture based on ReLU-ELM, PReLU-ELM, and TanhReLU-ELM. Results: In experimental works, a public dataset containing COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 classes was used to verify the validity of the MKs-ELM-DNN model proposed. According to the results obtained, the accuracy score was obtained as 98.36% using the MKs-ELM-DNN model. The results have demonstrated that, when compared, the MKs-ELM-DNN model proposed is proven to be more successful than the state-of-the-art algorithms and previous studies. Conclusion: This study shows that the proposed Multiple Kernels-ELM-based Deep Neural Network model can effectively contribute to the identification of COVID-19 disease.","Turkoglu, M",,516,10

However, simply broadcasting ""expert""knowledge carries a risk of being rejected, particularly in indigenous communities that traditionally rely on ancestral knowledge. This paper presents an investigation into developing a shared understanding of COVID-19 in indigenous communities of Choco, Colombia, that could help them develop effective mitigating practices, while being respectful of their believes. Unstructured interviews and observations were used to explore how indigenous communities perceive and respond to COVID-19. Based on these, a communicative strategy was developed using participatory design and gamification approach, that aimed at bridging their beliefs and traditional ancestral medicine with the official medical recommendations for prevention of the virus transmission. The findings revealed that the intervention became a trigger for mindful discussion within indigenous communities about the preventive measures from the virus, while gamification elements acted as an enabler of such discussion and created more trusting attitude towards the recommendations. Based on the initial findings, we discuss challenges of conducting indigenous research, including the role of trust between researchers and the communities, gamification as an enabler of shared knowing of a problem matter, and the importance of flexible participatory research methods whereby indigenous people are treated not as mere researched, but as full participants of the study.

In our research study, we aimed to examine the levels of perceived stress and health anxiety as well as coping styles among university students amid the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online-based survey at the University of Debrecen during the official lockdown in Hungary when dormitories were closed, and teaching was conducted remotely. Our questionnaire solicited data using three assessment tools, namely, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WCQ), and the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI). RESULTS: A total of 1320 students have participated in our study and 31 non-eligible responses were excluded. Among the remaining 1289 participants, 948 (73.5%) and 341 (26.5%) were Hungarian and international students, respectively. Female students predominated the overall sample with 920 participants (71.4%). In general, there was a statistically significant positive relationship between perceived stress and health anxiety. Health anxiety and perceived stress levels were significantly higher among international students compared to domestic ones. Regarding coping, wishful thinking was associated with higher levels of stress and anxiety among international students, while being a goal-oriented person acted the opposite way. Among the domestic students, cognitive restructuring as a coping strategy was associated with lower levels of stress and anxiety. Concerning health anxiety, female students (domestic and international) had significantly higher levels of health anxiety compared to males. Moreover, female students had significantly higher levels of perceived stress compared to males in the international group, however, there was no significant difference in perceived stress between males and females in the domestic group. CONCLUSION: The elevated perceived stress levels during major life events can be further deepened by disengagement from home (being away/abroad from country or family) and by using inadequate coping strategies. By following and adhering to the international recommendations, adopting proper coping methods, and equipping oneself with the required coping and stress management skills, the associated high levels of perceived stress and anxiety could be mitigated.","Garbóczy, Szabolcs; Szemán-Nagy, Anita; Ahmad, Mohamed S; Harsányi, Szilvia; Ocsenás, Dorottya; Rekenyi, Viktor; Al-Tammemi, Ala039; a, B; Kolozsvári, László Róbert",BMC Psychol,516,24

In this work, we report a random walk Monte Carlo simulation study of proximity-based infection spread. Social distancing is incorporated in the simulations through a single parameter, the size of each step in the random walk process. The step size $l$ is taken to be a multiple of $\langle r \rangle$, which is the average separation between individuals. Three temporal growth regimes (quadratic, intermediate power-law and exponential) are shown to emerge naturally from our simulations. For $l = \langle r \rangle$, we get intermediate power-law growth exponents that are in general agreement with available data from China. On the other hand, we obtain a quadratic growth for smaller step sizes $l \lesssim \langle r \rangle/2 $, while for large $l$ the growth is found to be exponential.

We monitored the longitudinal values of VR and other respiratory parameters for 28 days. Patients successfully discontinued from respiratory support by day 28 of ICU stay were defined as the successfully discontinued group, while those who died or failed to discontinue were defined as the failed to discontinue group. VR and other respiratory parameters were compared between these groups. ResultsExcept for advanced age, prolonged ventilation period, and higher mortality in the failed to discontinue group, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of any other background or respiratory parameter at 2 hours (day 0) after initiation of respiratory support. Longitudinal VR monitoring revealed significantly higher VR values in the failed to discontinue group than the successfully discontinued group on day 4 of respiratory support. Upon predicting the failure to discontinue respiratory support, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of VR values on day 4 of respiratory support was 0.748. A threshold of 1.56 achieved the highest predictive performance with a sensitivity of 0.667 and a specificity of 0.762. This threshold enabled the prediction of the successfully discontinued outcome at 0.810 of the negative predictive value. ConclusionsElevated VR values on day 4 of respiratory support were predictive of successful discontinuation of respiratory support in patients with severe COVID-19. Longitudinal VR values after initiation of respiratory support can be used as a practical index to stratify severe COVID-19.","Kaku, Natsuko; Nakagama, Yu; Shirano, Michinori; Shinomiya, Sari; Shimazu, Kazuhiro; Yamazaki, Katsuaki; Maehata, Yoshito; Morita, Ryo; Nitahara, Yuko; Yamamoto, Hiromasa; Mizobata, Yasumitsu; Kido, Yasutoshi",,516,30

Previous studies on COVID-19 mostly included older hospitalized-adults. Little information on infectivity among and characteristics of youngsters with COVID-19 is available. METHODS: A cluster of 22 close-contacts of a 22-year-old male (Patient-Index) including youngsters with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and hospitalized close-contacts testing negative for severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Anhui Province, China was prospectively-traced. RESULTS: Since January 23, 2020, we enrolled a cluster of eight youngsters with COVID-19 (median age [range], 22 [16-23] years; six males) originating from Patient-Index returning from Wuhan to Hefei on January 19. Patient-Index visited his 16-year-old female cousin in the evening on his return, and met 15 previous classmates in a get-together on January 21. He reported being totally asymptomatic and were described by all his contacts as healthy on January 19-21. His very first symptoms were itchy eyes and fever developed at noon and in the afternoon on January 22, respectively. Seven youngsters (his cousin and six classmates) became infected with COVID-19 after a-few-hour-contact with Patient-Index. None of the patients and contacts had visited Wuhan (except Patient-Index), or had any exposure to wet-markets, wild-animals, or medical-institutes within three months. For affected youngsters, the median incubation-period was 2 days (range, 1-4). The median serial-interval was 1 day (range, 0-4). Half or more of the eight COVID-19-infected youngsters had fever, cough, sputum production, nasal congestion, and fatigue on admission. All patients had mild conditions. Six patients developed pneumonia (all mild; one bilateral) on admission. As of February 20, four patients were discharged. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2-infection presented strong infectivity during the incubation-period with rapid transmission in this cluster of youngsters outside Wuhan. COVID-19 developed in these youngsters had fast onset and various nonspecific atypical manifestations, and were much milder than in older patients as previously reported.","Huang, Lei; Zhang, Xiuwen; Zhang, Xinyue; Wei, Zhijian; Zhang, Lingli; Xu, Jingjing; Liang, Peipei; Xu, Yuanhong; Zhang, Chengyuan; Xu, Aman",J Infect,516,16

This paper will analyse the implications for insurance investing. We start by showing the impact of the severe drawdown in the equity markets during the initial phase of the crisis in March/April 2020 on a typical insurer's balance sheet. We then look at the effects of the dislocations in fixed income, which make up the largest share of exposures in insurance companies' portfolios. We track the performance of investment grade credit during the year while paying special attention to the impact of downgrades on insurers' solvency capital. We finally study alternative investments with particular focus on private markets. These investments are a faster-growing part of insurance companies' exposures and pose specific challenges as they are complex, more difficult to access, have limited liquidity and are often harder to price, especially during times of high market volatility. Yet, compared to their equivalent public market exposures, private investments provide additional income, which allows insurers to charge lower rates on their products to policyholders. As the sophistication and complexity of investments keep growing, companies as well as regulators need to find a good balance between policyholder protection and market efficiency.","Liedtke, Patrick M",Geneva Pap Risk Insur Issues Pract,516,20

In particular, the usual task of outpatient care has shifted to the telemedicine format, bringing along all of its attendant advantages and gargantuan challenges. The authors sought to determine the responsiveness of this telemedicine setup to the needs of their disadvantaged patients and explored the application of Bayesian inference to enhance the use of teleconsultation in daily clinical decision-making. METHODS: The authors used the following methods to assess the telemedicine setup used in a low-resource setting during the pandemic: 1) a cross-sectional survey of patients who participated in a medical consultation via telemedicine during the 16-week period from March 16, 2020, to July 15, 2020; 2) a cost-benefit analysis of the use of telemedicine by patients; and 3) a case illustration of a Bayesian approach application unique to the teleconsultation scenario. RESULTS: Of the 272 patient beneficiaries of telemedicine in a 16-week period, 57 responded to the survey. The survey responses regarding neurosurgical outpatient care through telemedicine yielded high ratings of utility for the patients and their caregivers. According to 64% of respondents, the affordability of the telemedicine setup also prevented them from borrowing money from others, among other adverse life events prevented. There were realized financial gains on the part of the patients in terms of cost savings and protection from further impoverishment. The benefit-cost ratio was 3.51 for the patients, signifying that the benefits outweighed the costs. An actual teleconsultation case vignette was reported that is meant to be instructive and contributory to the preparedness of the neurosurgeon on the provider end of the service delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine holds promise as a viable and safe method for health service delivery during the pandemic. In the setting of a health system that is continually challenged by shortages of resources, this study shows that an effective telemedicine setup can come with high benefit-cost ratios and quality of care, along with the assurance of patient satisfaction. The potential for high-quality care can be enhanced by the inclusion of the Bayesian framework to the basic toolkit of remote clinical assessment. When confronted with choices in terms of differential diagnosis and tests, the rigor of a simple application of the Bayesian framework can minimize costs arising from uncertainties.","Ferraris, Kevin Paul; Golidtum, Jared Paul; Zuñiga, Brian Karlo W; Bautista, Maria Cristina G; Alcazaren, Jose Carlos; Seng, Kenny; Navarro, Joseph Erroll",Neurosurg Focus,516,4

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study at Clínico San Carlos Hospital to analyze the management of patients with breast cancer during the pandemic outbreak and the surgical strategy after the pandemic outbreak. We created a practical and dynamic tool based on a ""traffic light"" system for prioritizing surgical time. Every patient was contacted by telephone with a preoperative COVID-19 protocol. After surgical procedures, patient satisfaction was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer in-patient satisfaction with cancer care questionnaire (EORTC IN-PATSAT32). RESULTS: Patients with breast cancer actively treated with surgical procedures were put on a waiting list and received systemic therapy. Telemedicine was used to evaluate any side effects and to avoid unnecessary hospital visits. Surgery was only considered after the pandemic outbreak, and then, only those procedures designed to minimize surgical complications and, therefore, reduce hospital stay. We also measured patients' satisfaction with medical and nursing scales that resulted in a ""very good"" evaluation tending to ""excellent"".

Our main objective was to examine the association between in-hospital death and each routine at-home glucose-lowering drug both individually and in combination with metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus admitted for COVID-19. We also evaluated their association with the composite outcome of the need for ICU admission, invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death as well as on the development of in-hospital complications and a long-time hospital stay. METHODS: We selected all patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine's registry of COVID-19 patients (SEMI-COVID-19 Registry). It is an ongoing, observational, multicenter, nationwide cohort of patients admitted for COVID-19 in Spain from March 1, 2020. Each glucose-lowering drug user was matched with a user of other glucose-lowering drugs in a 1:1 manner by propensity scores. In order to assess the adequacy of propensity score matching, we used the standardized mean difference found in patient characteristics after matching. There was considered to be a significant imbalance in the group if a standardized mean difference > 10% was found. To evaluate the association between treatment and study outcomes, both conditional logit and mixed effect logistic regressions were used when the sample size was &#8805; 100. RESULTS: A total of 2666 patients were found in the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, 1297 on glucose-lowering drugs in monotherapy and 465 in combination with metformin. After propensity matching, 249 patients on metformin, 105 on dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, 129 on insulin, 127 on metformin/dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, 34 on metformin/sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, and 67 on metformin/insulin were selected. No at-home glucose-lowering drugs showed a significant association with in-hospital death; the composite outcome of the need of intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death; in-hospital complications; or long-time hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus admitted for COVID-19, at-home glucose-lowering drugs showed no significant association with mortality and adverse outcomes.

METHODS: A retrospective observational case series of ambulatory procedures was performed. Records since the reopening of ambulatory centers in New York were searched for patients with positive coronavirus disease 2019 nasal swab results who underwent ambulatory procedures. Chart reviews were conducted to determine coronavirus disease history and hospitalizations, demographic information, procedure details, and 30-day admissions. RESULTS: A total of 3,762 patients underwent ambulatory procedures. Of those, 53 were previously diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 but recovered and tested negative at preprocedural testing. Of the 3,709 asymptomatic patients, 37 (1.00%) tested positive during preprocedural testing; 21 patients had their procedures delayed on average 28.6 days until testing negative, while 16 had their procedures performed before testing negative owing to the time sensitivity of the procedure. There were no major complications or 30-day admissions in any of these asymptomatic patients. Three patients tested positive for coronavirus disease after having an ambulatory procedure. CONCLUSION: Positive tests in asymptomatic patients led to procedure delays of 28.6 days. No patients who underwent ambulatory procedures after a positive coronavirus disease 2019 test had any coronavirus disease-related complications, regardless of whether or not the procedure was delayed until testing negative. Three patients tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 after having an ambulatory procedure; however, at an average of 19.7 days after, these cases were likely community acquired making the rate of nosocomial infection negligible.","Larsen, Christopher G; Bub, Christine D; Schaffler, Benjamin C; Walden, Timothy; Intravia, Jessica M",Surgery (St. Louis),516,12

Given that pregnant women constitute a vulnerable group, they may be at greater risk for developing psychopathological symptoms due to the confinement. The current study aimed to longitudinally analyze the presence and evolution of indicators of depression and anxiety in pregnant and non-pregnant women, and to identify the differential effects of social isolation or distancing measures on these groups. Participants were 105 pregnant and 105 non-pregnant Argentine adult women. They completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and closed-ended questions on sociodemographic factors, at four different times. Results showed a progressive increase in anxiety and depressive symptoms in the first 50 days of confinement in both groups, and a slight decrease after approximately 150 days. Pregnant women presented a more pronounced initial increase in symptoms, and a weaker decrease at the last wave, compared to the non-pregnant. Results suggest that the pandemic context produces a moderate negative early response and that the initial flexibilizations of sanitary measures (50 days) did not slow down the progression of symptoms (even less in pregnant women). In conclusion, being pregnant could be an extra risk factor for the development of psychopathological symptoms during this pandemic. The particular vulnerability of pregnant women and the associated potential negative effects both on them and on their offspring underline the importance of perinatal health policies aimed at prevention and treatment of possible future consequences.","López-Morales, Hernán; Del-Valle, Macarena Verónica; Andrés, María Laura; Gelpi Trudo, Rosario; Canet-Juric, Lorena; Urquijo, Sebastián",,516,29

In-hospital mortality and discharge were evaluated by competing risk analysis. The Fine and Gray model was fitted in order to estimate the effect of covariates on the cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) for in-hospital mortality and discharge. 426 adult patients [median age 68 (IQR 56 to 77 years)] were admitted with confirmed COVID-19 over a 5-week period; 292 (69%) were male. By 21 April 2020, 141 (33%) of these patients had died, 239 (56%) patients had been discharged and 46 (11%) were still hospitalised. Among these 46 patients, updated as of 30 May, 2020, 5 (10.9%) had died, 8 (17.4%) were still in ICU, 12 (26.1%) were transferred to lower intensity care units and 21 (45.7%) were discharged. Regression on the CIFs for in-hospital mortality showed that older age, male sex, number of comorbidities and hospital admission after March 4th were independent risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Older age, male sex and number of comorbidities definitively predicted in-hospital mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.","Zuccaro, Valentina; Celsa, Ciro; Sambo, Margherita; Battaglia, Salvatore; Sacchi, Paolo; Biscarini, Simona; Valsecchi, Pietro; Pieri, Teresa Chiara; Gallazzi, Ilaria; Colaneri, Marta; Sachs, Michele; Roda, Silvia; Asperges, Erika; Lupi, Matteo; Di Filippo, Alessandro; Seminari, Elena; Di Matteo, Angela; Novati, Stefano; Maiocchi, Laura; Enea, Marco; Attanasio, Massimo; Cammà, Calogero; Bruno, Raffaele",Sci Rep,516,4

A protocol for the identification of novel coronaviruses by viral metagenomic sequencing in diagnostic laboratories may contribute to pandemic preparedness. AIM: The aim of this study is to validate a metagenomic virus discovery protocol as a tool for coronavirus pandemic preparedness. METHODS: The performance of a viral metagenomic protocol in a clinical setting for the identification of novel coronaviruses was tested using clinical samples containing SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, in combination with databases generated to contain only viruses of before the discovery dates of these coronaviruses, to mimic virus discovery. RESULTS: Classification of NGS reads using Centrifuge and Genome Detective resulted in assignment of the reads to the closest relatives of the emerging coronaviruses. Low nucleotide and amino acid identity (81% and 84%, respectively, for SARS-CoV-2) in combination with up to 98% genome coverage were indicative for a related, novel coronavirus. Capture probes targeting vertebrate viruses, designed in 2015, enhanced both sequencing depth and coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the latter increasing from 71% to 98%. CONCLUSION: The model used for simulation of virus discovery enabled validation of the metagenomic sequencing protocol. The metagenomic protocol with virus probes designed before the pandemic, can assist the detection and identification of novel coronaviruses directly in clinical samples.","Carbo, Ellen C; Sidorov, Igor A; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C; Snijder, Eric J; Claas, Eric C; Laros, Jeroen F J; Kroes, Aloys C M; de Vries, Jutte J C",J Clin Virol,516,20

Preliminary data suggest that the nutritional status can change the course of the infection, and on the matter, zinc is crucial for growth, development, and the maintenance of immune function. In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods that can contribute to control of disease. The aim of this paper is to establish the relation between zinc and COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: From the prior scientific knowledge, we have performed a review of the literature and examine the role of zinc in immune function in the infection by COVID-19. Our findings are that the zinc as an anti-inflammatory agent may help to optimize immune function and reduce the risk of infection.

The main aim was to assess the association of complete blood indices measured at baseline with COVID-19 related in-hospital clinical outcomes, including length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay, receiving mechanical ventilation, degree of lung injury and in-hospital death, and post-recovery status. This retrospective study included patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 infection from August 20, to September 25, 2020. The initial study cohort included 127 patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. Of whom 26 patients were excluded, leaving 101 patients for final analysis. low lymphocytes % [Odds ratio and confidence intervals = OR (CI)] [0.2(0.0-0.2, p=0.03] increased the odds of ICU stay length while high platelet mean volume (PMV) [0.9 (1.1-5, p<0.00], high platelet distribution width (PDW) [0.3(0.4-1.9), p<0.00], and low lymphocytes % [0.2 (0.0-0.2), p=0.02] increased the odds of length of hospital stay. Decreased lymphocytes % showed significant independent association with increased risk for mechanical ventilation use [0.9 (0.9-1), p=0.04], extensive degree of lung injury [0.2 (0.1-0.7), p<0.00], and in-hospital death [0.5 (0.3-0.8), p=0.01]. High lymphocytes %[0.9 (0.9-1), p<0.00] and high PMV [0.3 (0.3-0.8), p=0.02] were significantly associated with complete recovery while increased neutrophil % [1 (1-1.1), p=0.04] was associated with increased risk for post recovery fatigue. In conclusion, low lymphocytes % and high neutrophil % are useful markers for predicting adverse in-hospital outcome and post-recovery persistent fatigue, respectively. High PMV and lymphocyte % showed significant association with favorable short-term prognosis.","Al-Buthabhak, Karrar; Nafakhi, Hussein; Shukur, Mohammed H; Nafakhi, Ahmed; Alareedh, Mohammed; Shaghee, Foaad",Monaldi arch. chest dis,516,16

It is in the best interests of patients for care providers to streamline services where possible to maximise the number of cases that can be performed by limited surgical and anaesthetic teams, as well as minimising patient interactions and admission times to reduce potential spread of the virus. There is evidence that wide awake local anaesthetic no tourniquet (WALANT) hand and upper limb surgery can meet this need in a number of ways, including reduced pre-operative work up, the lack of a need for an anaesthetist or ventilator, shorter inpatient stays and improved cost efficiencies. Though updated national guidelines exist that advocate increased use of WALANT surgery in response to the pandemic there are not yet clear protocols to facilitate this. We outline a protocol being developed at one UK Major Trauma Centre tailored to the expansion of WALANT hand and upper limb emergency surgery with particular emphasis on facilitating timely surgical care while minimising healthcare encounters pre and post-operatively. This will serve to reduce potential transmission of the virus and create cost efficiencies to free funding for COVID-19 related care.

Moreover, CMT members in a pandemic face additional demands due to unknown characteristics of the disease and a highly volatile environment. To support and ensure the effectiveness of CMTs, we need to understand how CMT members can successfully cope with these multiple demands. Connecting teamwork research with the job demands and resources approach as starting framework, we conducted structured interviews and critical incident analyses with 144 members of various CMTs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Content analyses revealed both perceived demands as well as perceived resources in CMTs. Moreover, structuring work processes, open, precise and regular communication, and anticipatory, goal-oriented and fast problem solving were described as particularly effective behaviors in CMTs.

The resulting Bayesian Network is processed by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), implemented in JAGS interfaced to R via rjags. As outcome, we get several probability density functions (pdf's) of $\epsilon$, each conditioned on the data provided by the three pharma companies. The result is rather stable against large variations of the number of people participating in the trials and it is `somehow' in good agreement with the results provided by the companies, in the sense that their values correspond to the most probable value (`mode') of the pdf's resulting from MCMC, thus reassuring us about the validity of our simple model. However we maintain that the number to be reported as `vaccine efficacy' should be the mean of the distribution, rather than the mode, as it was already very clear to Laplace about 250 years ago (its `rule of succession' follows from the simplest problem of the kind). This is particularly important in the case in which the number of successes equals the numbers of trials, as it happens with the efficacy against `severe forms' of infection, claimed by Moderna to be 100%. The implication of the various uncertainties on the predicted number of vaccinated infectees is also shown, using both MCMC and approximated formulae.","D'Agostini, Giulio; Esposito, Alfredo",,516,16

Thus, these changes in living conditions have had deleterious consequences on the behavior of PWD and subsequently on their caregivers' mental health, the two being linked. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to examine changes in behavior among PWD and to look for associations between the evolution of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and caregivers' mental health in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: The study was conducted among caregivers of PWD living at home in France. Caregivers were interviewed via an anonymous cross-sectional online survey during the first lockdown between April 15 and June 15, 2020. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-nine caregivers accompanying a relative living at home participated in the study; 43.3%of the PWD presented a worsening of BPSD during the lockdown. With multivariate logistic regressions, a significant association was observed between ""more BPSD"" and burden, anxiety and depression, between ""BPSD equivalent"" and anxiety and depression, and between ""emerging BPSD"" and only depression. CONCLUSION: The lockdown seems to have an impact on behavioral disorders in PWD and these disorders are associated with poorer mental health of caregivers.

Equipment shortages and varying testing capabilities have however hindered the usefulness of the official reported positive COVID-19 case counts. We introduce four complementary approaches to estimate the cumulative incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in each state in the US as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, using a combination of excess influenza-like illness reports, COVID-19 test statistics, COVID-19 mortality reports, and a spatially structured epidemic model. Instead of relying on the estimate from a single data source or method that may be biased, we provide multiple estimates, each relying on different assumptions and data sources. Across our four approaches emerges the consistent conclusion that on April 4, 2020, the estimated case count was 5 to 50 times higher than the official positive test counts across the different states. Nationally, our estimates of COVID-19 symptomatic cases as of April 4 have a likely range of 2.3 to 4.8 million, with possibly as many as 7.6 million cases, up to 25 times greater than the cumulative confirmed cases of about 311,000. Extending our methods to May 16, 2020, we estimate that cumulative symptomatic incidence ranges from 4.9 to 10.1 million, as opposed to 1.5 million positive test counts. The proposed combination of approaches may prove useful in assessing the burden of COVID-19 during resurgences in the US and other countries with comparable surveillance systems.","Lu, Fred S; Nguyen, Andre T; Link, Nicholas B; Molina, Mathieu; Davis, Jessica T; Chinazzi, Matteo; Xiong, Xinyue; Vespignani, Alessandro; Lipsitch, Marc; Santillana, Mauricio",PLoS Comput Biol,516,16

The Mann-Kendall test was used to analyse SWE trends, and the ridge regression was performed to figure out the relative contributions of meteorological factors to SWE dynamics. The pixels with modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) higher than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were identified as SWE. The mean relative error (MRE) of the SWGs interpolation results was below 10%. At the annual scale, the average SWA and number of lakes over 1 ha showed significant upward trends of 4.4 km2 yr-1 and 7.53 yr-1, respectively. The monthly WBA increased in summer and autumn while decreased in spring and winter. The maximum freezing and thawing ratios were 53.74% in December and 37.32% in May, respectively.

The present literature review was aimed at assessing the potential effects of air pollutants on the transmission and severity of respiratory viral infections. We have reviewed the scientific literature regarding the association of outdoor air pollution and respiratory viruses on respiratory diseases. Evidence supports a clear association between air concentrations of some pollutants and human respiratory viruses interacting to adversely affect the respiratory system. Given the undoubted importance and topicality of the subject, we have paid special attention to the association between air pollutants and the transmission and severity of the effects caused by the coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, which causes the COVID-19. Although to date, and by obvious reasons, the number of studies on this issue are still scarce, most results indicate that chronic exposure to air pollutants delays/complicates recovery of patients of COVID-19 and leads to more severe and lethal forms of this disease.

A great number of medical centers have reported that patients with COVID-19 have developed acute kidney injury. The kidney is a target organ for SARS - COV2 because of ACE2 receptor, the binding site for this virus, is expressed in kidney tissue. The potential mechanisms for kidney injury are direct kidney injury, inflammation, activation of coagulation and complement cascades. Data from centers worldwide reported a wide range of AKI incidence, from 0,5% in China to 46% in USA. The aim of this study was to analyze incidence, risk factors and outcomes of AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID 19 who were treated from 01.04. to 01.06.2020. at Nephrology Department of University Clinical Center Zvezdara, which was at the time transformed into COVID hospital. METHOD: This retrospective observational study included 51 patients who had normal kidney function before the infection with SARS COV2, and 7 of them developed dialysis non-dependent AKI. Analysis included data collection from the patients’ history including demographic, clinical and administrative data. Statistical analysis has been performed using SPSS software version 20 (IBM Corporation, New York, USA). RESULTS: Out of 51 patients 7 (13.7%) developed AKI, mean age was 59 + 16 years and 53% were male. Diabetes mellitus was present in 27 of patients with AKI, hypertension in 6/7, obesity in 3/7, coronary artery disease in 1/7 and 1 of 7 patients was smoker. These risk factors except obesity (p= 0.05) didn’t vary significantly between two groups (AKI and non AKI patients with COVID-19). Our results showed significant correlation between AKI development and obesity (p= 0.05, OR 4.75), Charlston index score (p=0.01), D dimer score (p=0.01), and CT COVID score (p=0.03). Regarding the outcome, COVID 19 patients with AKI showed 7-fold higher risk for fatal outcome (p= 0.046). CONCLUSION: Obesity, higher D dimer values, worse CT findings and higher Charlston comorbidity score index were associated with acute kidney injury in patients with COVID 19. AKI proved to be significant risk factor for fatal outcome in patients with SARS COV2 infection.","Bulatovic, Ana; Bjedov, Jelena; Maslarevic Radovic, Vesna; Dimkovic, Nada; Naumovic, Radomir",Nephrol Dial Transplant,516,32

The development of prophylactics and therapeutics is urgently needed to prevent and control MERS-CoV infections. In this study, a bacterium (Lactococcus lactis)-like particle (BLP) vaccine displaying the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) was developed, and gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles were used as substrates to externally bind to the MERS-CoV RBD through a protein anchor (PA). The designs included different numbers of lysin motif (LysM) repeats in the PAs linked by linkers (RBD-linker-PA2 (RLP(2)), RBD-linker-PA3 (RLP(3)) and RBD-PA3 (RP(3))), and three LysM repeats and a linker in the fusion proteins increased the binding activity to the RBD. The specific immune responses were tested by intranasally immunizing mice with RLP(3)-GEM with or without the adjuvant GEL01.

We collected clinical data of COVID-19 patients between January 18 and March 29 2020 in Wuhan, China . Gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), logistic regression (LR) model, and simplified LR were built to predict the mortality of COVID-19. We also evaluated different models by computing area under curve (AUC), accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) under fivefold cross-validation. A total of 2924 patients were included in our evaluation, with 257 (8.8%) died and 2667 (91.2%) survived during hospitalization. Upon admission, there were 21 (0.7%) mild cases, 2051 (70.1%) moderate case, 779 (26.6%) severe cases, and 73 (2.5%) critically severe cases. The GBDT model exhibited the highest fivefold AUC, which was 0.941, followed by LR (0.928) and LR-5 (0.913). The diagnostic accuracies of GBDT, LR, and LR-5 were 0.889, 0.868, and 0.887, respectively. In particular, the GBDT model demonstrated the highest sensitivity (0.899) and specificity (0.889). The NPV of all three models exceeded 97%, while their PPV values were relatively low, resulting in 0.381 for LR, 0.402 for LR-5, and 0.432 for GBDT. Regarding severe and critically severe cases, the GBDT model also performed the best with a fivefold AUC of 0.918. In the external validation test of the LR-5 model using 72 cases of COVID-19 from Brunei, leukomonocyte (%) turned to show the highest fivefold AUC (0.917), followed by urea (0.867), age (0.826), and SPO2 (0.704).

AIM: To investigate the changes in sexual life and sexual function of Chinese men during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: An online questionnaire was created and the survey was administered through social media to Chinese adult men. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main end point was the deteriorated erectile function or ejaculatory control ability, defined by self-evaluation or by decreased International Index of Erectile Function-5 items (IIEF-5) scores or increased premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT) scores. RESULTS: Altogether, 612 questionnaires were collected. About 322 (52.6%) subjects were unmarried. About 8.4% and 8.5% subjects reported deteriorated erectile function or ejaculation control ability by self-evaluation, whereas 31.9% and 17.9% subjects showed decreased IIEF-5 scores or increased PEDT scores. Subjects with deteriorated erectile function by self-evaluation and decreased IIEF-5 scores had higher General Anxiety Disorder-7 (P < .001 and P = .001) and higher Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (P < .001 and P = .002) after the epidemic, decreased frequency of sexual life (P < .001 and P < .001) and physical exercise (P = .009 and .007) after the epidemic. Subjects with deteriorated ejaculation control ability by self-evaluation and increased PEDT scores had higher General Anxiety Disorder-7 (P < .001 and P < .001) and higher Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (P < .001 and P = .002) after the epidemic. Subjects with decreased frequency of sexual life had reduced income (P < .001), increased anxiety (P < .001) and depression (P < .001). Married subjects had higher proportion of improved depression (P = .048) and increased frequency of sexual life (P = .010). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 epidemic, decreased sexual function was present in a certain proportion of adult men, and the risk factors include increased anxiety and depression, and decreased frequency of sexual life.

However, DNA vaccines suffer from limited immunogenicity and thus strategies to enhance DNA vaccine potency are needed. We have previously demonstrated that for DNA vaccines encoding HPV-16 E7 antigen (CRT/E7) linkage with calreticulin (CRT) linked enhances both the E7-specific CD8(+) T cell immune responses and antitumor effects against E7-expressing tumors. In the current study, we aim to introduce an approach to elicit potent CD4(+) T cell help for the enhancement of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell immune responses generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination by using co-administration of a DNA vector expressing papillomavirus major and minor capsid antigens, L1 and L2. RESULT: We showed that co-administration of vectors containing codon-optimized bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) L1 and L2 in combination with DNA vaccines could elicit enhanced antigen-specific CD8(+) in both CRT/E7 and ovalbumin (OVA) antigenic systems. We also demonstrated that co-administration of vectors expressing BPV-1 L1 and/or L2 DNA with CRT/E7 DNA led to the generation of L1/L2-specific CD4(+) T cell immune responses and L1-specific neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, we showed that co-administration with DNA encoding BPV1 L1 significantly enhances the therapeutic antitumor effects generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination. In addition, the observed enhancement of CD8(+) T cell immune responses by DNA encoding L1 and L2 was also found to extend to HPV-16 L1/L2 system. CONCLUSION: Our strategy elicits both potent neutralizing antibody and therapeutic responses and may potentially be extended to other antigenic systems beyond papillomavirus for the control of infection and/or cancer.","Yang, Benjamin; Yang, Andrew; Peng, Shiwen; Pang, Xiaowu; Roden, Richard B.S.; Wu, T.-C.; Hung, Chien-Fu",Cell Biosci,516,3

The PEC treatment in the presence of 1.0 mM Br (PEC-Br) shows the highest virucidal efficiency, enabling complete inactivation of a ∼1000 TCID50 replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus (RDRADS) population within 31.7 s. The superior virucidal performances of PEC-X treatments can be attributed to the increased production of active oxygen species and additional viricides resulting from the PEC halide oxidation, as well as prolonged lifetime of photoholes (h(+)) for direct inactivation.

This is because the immunization system relies on functioning health facilities and stable communities to be effective. Its disruption increases the risk of epidemics of vaccine-preventable diseases which can increase child mortality. Therefore, policymakers must quickly identify robust and context-specific strategies to rapidly scale-up routine immunization in order to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on their national immunization performance. To achieve this, we propose a paradigm shift towards systems thinking and use of implementation science in immunization decision making. Systems thinking can inform a more nuanced and holistic understanding of the interrelationship that between COVID-19, its control strategies and childhood immunization. Tools like causal loop diagrams can be used to explicitly illustrate the systems structure by identifying the feedback loops. Once mapped and leverage points for interventions have been identified, implementation science can be used to guide the rapid uptake and utilization of multifaceted evidence-based innovations in complex practice settings. As Africa re-strategize for the post-2020 era, these emerging fields can contribute significantly in accelerating progress towards universal access to vaccines for all children on the continent despite COVID-19.","Adamu, Abdu A; Jalo, Rabiu I; Habonimana, Desire; Wiysonge, Charles S",Int J Infect Dis,516,10

We sought to develop a feasible means of getting repeated feedback from users. METHODS: Between 2017 and 2020, two Swiss centers for primary care (Lausanne and Bern) created citizen advisory groups to contribute to multiple improvement cycles for colorectal, prostate and lung cancer screening DAs. Following Community Based Participatory Research principles, we collaborated with local organizations to recruit citizens aged 50 to 75 without previous cancer diagnoses. We remunerated incidental costs and participant time. One center supplemented in-person meetings by mailed paper questionnaires, while the other supplemented meetings using small-group workshops and analyses of meeting transcripts. RESULTS: In Lausanne, we received input from 49 participants for three DAs between 2017 and 2020. For each topic, participants gave feedback on the initial draft and 2 subsequent versions during in-person meetings with ~ 8 participants and one round of mailed questionnaires. In Bern, 10 participants were recruited among standardized patients from the university, all of whom attended in-person meetings every three months between 2017 and 2020. At both sites, numerous changes were made to the content, appearance, language, and tone of DAs and outreach materials. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the participative process. CONCLUSIONS: Citizen advisory groups are a feasible means of repeatedly incorporating end-user feedback during the creation of multiple DAs.

METHODS: We evaluated a large cohort of patients with COVID-19-related hypoxemic respiratory failure at the temporary COVID-19 hospital in Mexico City. The primary outcome was the success rate of HFNC to prevent the progression to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). We also evaluated the risk factors associated with HFNC success or failure. RESULTS: HFNC use effectively prevented IMV in 71.4% of patients [270 of 378 patients; 95% confidence interval (CI) 66.6–75.8%]. Factors that were significantly different at admission included age, the presence of hypertension, and the Charlson comorbidity index. Predictors of therapy failure (adjusted hazard ratio, 95% CI) included the comorbidity-age-lymphocyte count-lactate dehydrogenase (CALL) score at admission (1.27, 1.09–1.47; p < 0.01), Rox index at 1 hour (0.82, 0.7–0.96; p = 0.02), and no prior steroid treatment (0.34, 95% CI 0.19–0.62; p < 0.0001). Patients with HFNC success rarely required admission to the intensive care unit and had shorter lengths of hospital stay [19/270 (7.0%) and 15.0 (interquartile range, 11–20) days, respectively] than those who required IMV [104/108 (96.3%) and 26.5 (20–36) days, respectively].

DYRKs and CLKs are also involved in diabetes, abnormal folate/methionine metabolism, osteoarthritis, several solid cancers (glioblastoma, breast, and pancreatic cancers) and leukemias (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute megakaryoblastic leukemia), viral infections (influenza, HIV-1, HCMV, HCV, CMV, HPV), as well as infections caused by unicellular parasites (Leishmania, Trypanosoma, Plasmodium). This variety of pathological implications calls for (1) a better understanding of the regulations and substrates of DYRKs and CLKs and (2) the development of potent and selective inhibitors of these kinases and their evaluation as therapeutic drugs.

The global propagation of the viral disease, denoted COVID-19 (“coronavirus disease 2019”), has unified the scientific community in searching for possible inhibitory small molecules or polypeptides. Given the known interaction between the human ACE2 (“Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2”) protein and the SARS-CoV virus (responsible for the coronavirus outbreak circa. 2003), considerable focus has been directed towards the putative interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and ACE2. However, a more holistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 vs. human inter-species interactome promises additional putative protein-protein interactions (PPI) that may be considered targets for the development of inhibitory therapeutics. To that end, we leverage two state-of-the-art, sequence-based PPI predictors (PIPE4 & SPRINT) capable of generating the comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 vs. human interactome, comprising approximately 285,000 pairwise predictions. Of these, we identify the high-scoring subset of human proteins predicted to interact with each of the 14 SARS-CoV-2 proteins by both methods, comprising 279 high-confidence putative interactions involving 225 human proteins. Notably, the Spike-ACE2 interaction was the highest ranked for both the PIPE4 and SPRINT predictors, corroborating existing evidence for this PPI. Furthermore, the PIPE-Sites algorithm was used to predict the putative subsequence that might mediate each interaction and thereby inform the design of inhibitory polypeptides intended to disrupt the corresponding host-pathogen interactions. We hereby publicly release the comprehensive set of PPI predictions and their corresponding PIPE-Sites landscapes in the following DataVerse repository: 10.5683/SP2/JZ77XA.

Viral vector based vaccines offer new avenues for the development of vaccines for effective disease control in poultry. Techniques developed for the construction of recombinant vaccinia viruses have been readily adapted to the construction of recombinant viruses based on fowlpox virus (rFPV). The ability to insert several genes into the large genome of fowlpox may enable the development of multivalent vaccines and vaccines incorporating immune response modifiers such as lymphokines. Newcastle disease, avian influenza, infectious bursal disease and Marek's disease antigens expressed by rFPV have been shown to be effective vaccines in poultry. None appear, however, to provide a substantial improvement in vaccine efficacy. Recombinant FPV will be a valuable adjunct to conventional vaccines currently in widespread use. Whether rFPV or other vector based vaccines can circumvent the problems of vaccination in the presence of high maternally derived antibodies is yet to be resolved. The observation that avipoxvirus recombinants may be suitable for the vaccination of non‐avian species provides an added dimension to vaccines based on FPV or other avipoxviruses.

This defect can be explained by the presence of circulating autoantibodies against IFN-I. We set out to improve the detection and the quantification of such antibodies (Abs) in a cohort of severe Covid-19 patients, in an effort to better document the prevalence of these Abs as the pandemics evolves and how they correlate with the clinical course of the disease. Methods Anti-IFN-a Abs was investigated 84 critical COVID-19 patients who were admitted to ICU at the Lyon University Hospital, France with a commercially available kit (Thermo-Fisher). Results Twenty-one patients out of 84 (25%) had anti-IFNa2 Ab above cut-off (>34ng/mL) in sera. A neutralizing activity against IFN-a2 was evidenced in 15 of them, suggesting that 18% of patients were positive for neutralizing anti-IFN-a and -w auto-Abs. In addition, in most of patients with neutralizing IFN-I Abs, we noticed an impairment of the IFN-I response. However, we did not find any difference in terms of clinical characteristics or outcome between critical COVID-19 patients with or without neutralizing anti-IFN-a2 auto-Abs in these conditions. Finally, we detected anti-type I IFN auto-Abs in sera of COVID-19 patients were detected throughout the ICU stay. Conclusions We report that 18% of severe COVID-19 patients were positive for these Anti-Type-I IFN Abs, confirming the detrimental role of these Abs on the antiviral response.

The low efficacy of this new mRNA vaccine, which showed only 47% protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, was surprising, given the high efficacy of two previous mRNA-based vaccines. A number of factors have been suggested to play a role in the low efficacy in the CVnCoV study, particularly around the dose and immunogenicity of the vaccine (which uses a slightly different mRNA construct) and the potential role of infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants (which were the dominant strains observed in the CVnCoV trial).","Cromer, D.; Reynaldi, A.; Steain, M.; Triccas, J.

Worsening infected patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission associated with 30% of mortality. A part of worsening is induced by hemostasis deregulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of coagulation activation in COVID-19 progression. Thirty-five of the 99 patients got clinically worse. The final model of the logistic regression analysis revealed that O(2) requirement (RR = 7.27 [1.50–19.31]), monocytes below 0.2G/L (RR = 2.88 [1.67–3.19]), fibrinogen levels (RR = 1.45 [1.17–1.82] per g/L increase), prothrombin fragments 1+2 higher than 290 pM (RR = 2.39 [1.20–3.30]), and thrombin peak (RR = 1.28 [1.03–1.59] per 50 nM increase) were associated with an increased risk of clinical worsening. A fibrinogen level threshold of 5.5 g/L, a thrombin peak measurement threshold of 99 pM, and O(2) requirement associated with clinical outcome in more than 80% of our cohort. In conclusion, we identified fibrinogen and thrombin peak at admission as coagulation biomarkers associated with an increased risk of ICU admission or death. This finding allows initiating steroids and triage for worsening patients. Our results should therefore be considered as exploratory and deserve confirmation.","Billoir, Paul; Alexandre, Kevin; Duflot, Thomas; Roger, Maxime; Miranda, Sébastien; Goria, Odile; Joly, Luc Marie; Demeyere, Mathieu; Feugray, Guillaume; Brunel, Valery; Etienne, Manuel; Le Cam Duchez, Véronique",Front Med (Lausanne),516,1

The cytokines secreted following inflammasome activation, which include IL-1 and IL-18, regulate cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system, guiding the subsequent immune responses. In this study we used murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), infection of the central nervous system and liver to assess of the role of the inflammasome and its related cytokines on pathogenesis and host defense during viral infection. Mice lacking all inflammasome signaling due to the absence of caspase-1 and -11 were more vulnerable to infection, with poor survival and elevated viral replication compared to wild type mice. Mice lacking IL-1 signaling experienced elevated viral replication but similar survival compared to wild type controls. In the absence of IL-18, mice had elevated viral replication and poor survival, and this protective effect of IL-18 was found to be due to promotion of interferon gamma production in αβ T cells. These data suggest that inflammasome signaling is largely protective during murine coronavirus infection, in large part due to the pro-inflammatory effects of IL-18.","Zalinger, Zachary B.; Elliott, Ruth; Weiss, Susan R.",Journal of NeuroVirology,516,1

Whether POAF persists beyond discharge is not well defined. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring enhances detection of POAF among cardiac surgical patients during the first 30 days after hospital discharge compared with usual care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study is an investigator-initiated, open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial conducted at 10 Canadian centers. Enrollment spanned from March 2017 to March 2020, with follow-up through September 11, 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, enrollment stopped on July 17, 2020, at which point 85% of the proposed sample size was enrolled. Cardiac surgical patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65-74 years, female sex) score greater than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 2 with risk factors for POAF, no history of preoperative AF, and POAF lasting less than 24 hours during hospitalization were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group underwent continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring with wearable, patch-based monitors for 30 days after randomization. Monitoring was not mandated in the usual care group within 30 days after randomization. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was cumulative AF and/or atrial flutter lasting 6 minutes or longer detected by continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring or by a 12-lead electrocardiogram within 30 days of randomization. Prespecified secondary outcomes included cumulative AF lasting 6 hours or longer and 24 hours or longer within 30 days of randomization, death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, non–central nervous system thromboembolism, major bleeding, and oral anticoagulation prescription. RESULTS: Of the 336 patients randomized (163 patients in the intervention group and 173 patients in the usual care group; mean [SD] age, 67.4 [8.1] years; 73 women [21.7%]; median [interquartile range] CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score, 4.0 [3.0-4.0] points), 307 (91.4%) completed the trial. In the intent-to-treat analysis, the primary end point occurred in 32 patients (19.6%) in the intervention group vs 3 patients (1.7%) in the usual care group (absolute difference, 17.9%; 95% CI, 11.5%-24.3%; P < .001). AF lasting 6 hours or longer was detected in 14 patients (8.6%) in the intervention group vs 0 patients in the usual care group (absolute difference, 8.6%; 95% CI, 4.3%-12.9%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In post–cardiac surgical patients at high risk of stroke, no preoperative AF history, and AF lasting less than 24 hours during hospitalization, continuous monitoring revealed a significant increase in the rate of POAF after discharge that would otherwise not be detected by usual care. Studies are needed to examine whether these patients will benefit from oral anticoagulation therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02793895","Ha, Andrew C.
