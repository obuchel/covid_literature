COVID-19 spread analysis has attracted considerable research efforts in many areas including the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. However, most studies do not use real data on population mobility, or choose an overly wide range of objects. This paper studies the COVID-19 epidemic in Shenzhen from January 26 to February 16, focusing on the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. Combined with the population mobility data, we propose the Source-SEIR model. We estimated that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.61. The experiment results show that the combination of population mobility data is helpful to the evaluation of the epidemic development, and the restrictions on population mobility in Shenzhen have played a role in curbing the deterioration of COVID-19 epidemic. Without restrictions on population mobility, there will be more than 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Wu, Z.; Li, X.; Cao, J.; Zhang, Z.; Lin, X.; Zhu, Y.; Ma, L.; Liao, H.","15th CCF Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, Chinese CSCW 2020",958,24

METHODS: Ecological longitudinal study using multivariable negative binomial regression for panel data. Daily numbers of Covid-19 cases and deaths, and data on social distancing interventions, for the 37 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) were analysed. RESULTS: Covid-19 cumulative mortality over the first pandemic wave varied widely across countries (range, 4.16 to 855 deaths per million population). On average, one-day delay in application of mass gatherings ban was associated with an adjusted increase in Covid-19 cumulative mortality by 6.97% (95% CI, 3.45 to 10.5), whilst a one-day delay in school closures was associated with an increase of 4.37% (95% CI, 1.58 to 7.17) over the study period. We estimated that if each country had enacted both interventions one week earlier, Covid-19 cumulative mortality could have been reduced by an average of 44.1% (95% CI, 20.2 to 67.9). CONCLUSIONS: Early application of mass gatherings ban and school closures in outbreak epicentres was associated with an important reduction in Covid-19 cumulative mortality during the first pandemic wave. These findings may support policy decision making.","Piovani, Daniele; Christodoulou, Maria Nefeli; Hadjidemetriou, Andreas; Pantavou, Katerina; Zaza, Paraskevi; Bagos, Pantelis G; Bonovas, Stefanos; Nikolopoulos, Georgios K",J. infect,958,22

This study aimed to assess the attitudes and perceptions of clinical medical and dental students in Lagos, Nigeria, about volunteering during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Materials and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted amongst medical and dental students undergoing clinical postings at the two public universities in Lagos, Nigeria, using total population sampling. Data were collected using a web-based questionnaire and analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to test for association at the level of significance of 5%. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 23.3 years ± 2.6 standard deviation and 62.5% were females. The majority (82.9%) of the respondents agreed to volunteer if provided with adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and if adequately trained to do so (79.3%). Although perceived as dangerous, the majority (91.2%) of the respondents considered volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic as a form of educational experience. Compared to the final-year students, penultimate year students were more likely to volunteer in the event of a health manpower shortage. The final-year students were more likely to volunteer if government made the request. Female students were more likely than male students to volunteer even if they were not compensated but would require parental approval. Conclusion: Medical and dental students perceived their involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic as a form of educational experience but would require adequate training and PPE. There is a need to train and provide adequate PPE for them to function as volunteers.","Adejimi, Adebola Afolake; Odugbemi, Babatunde Adeniran; Odukoya, Oluwakemi Ololade; Okunade, Kehinde Sharafadeen; Taiwo, Aminah Oluwatamilore; Osibogun, Akin",Niger Postgrad Med J,958,20

METHODS: Patients with cancer routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by nasal swab and real-time polymerase chain reaction between March 21 and May 4, 2020, were included. The results of this cancer cohort were statistically compared with the SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the Austrian population as determined by a representative nationwide random sample study (control cohort 1) and a cohort of patients without cancer presenting to our hospital (control cohort 2). RESULTS: A total of 1,688 SARS-CoV-2 tests in 1,016 consecutive patients with cancer were performed. A total of 270 of 1,016 (26.6%) of the patients were undergoing active anticancer treatment in a neoadjuvant/adjuvant and 560 of 1,016 (55.1%) in a palliative setting. A total of 53 of 1,016 (5.2%) patients self-reported symptoms potentially associated with COVID-19. In 4 of 1,016 (0.4%) patients, SARS-CoV-2 was detected. At the time of testing at our department, all four SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were asymptomatic, and two of them had recovered from symptomatic COVID-19. Viral clearance was achieved in three of the four patients 14-56 days after testing positive. The estimated odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence between the cancer cohort and control cohort 1 was 1.013 (95% CI, 0.209 to 4.272; P = 1), and between control cohort 2 and the cancer cohort it was 18.333 (95% CI, 6.056 to 74.157). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that continuation of active anticancer therapy and follow-up visits in a large tertiary care hospital are feasible and safe after implementation of strict population-wide and institutional safety measures during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Routine SARS-CoV-2 testing of patients with cancer seems advisable to detect asymptomatic virus carriers and avoid uncontrolled viral spread.","Berghoff, Anna S; Gansterer, Margaretha; Bathke, Arne C; Trutschnig, Wolfgang; Hungerländer, Philipp; Berger, Julia M; Kreminger, Judith; Starzer, Angelika M; Strassl, Robert; Schmidt, Ralf; Willschke, Harald; Lamm, Wolfgang; Raderer, Markus; Gottlieb, Alex D; Mauser, Norbert J; Preusser, Matthias",J Clin Oncol,958,20

Spectroscopic methods, XRD, TGA, 1H NMR, GPC and morphology analyses were utilized to characterize the structural properties of the BCT-g-inulin complex, and our results confirmed the conjugation of BCT and inulin. The conjugation possibly occurred between the hydroxyl group attached at the C6 position of inulin and the C6/C8 position of flavon-3-ol units of BCT. The grafting ratio and grafting efficiency of the BCT-g-inulin complex were 357.54 ± 2.98 g kg-1 complex and 74.57 ± 1.44%, respectively. The data of the antioxidant assays indicated that the BCT-g-inulin complex showed a significantly higher antioxidant activity than native inulin. Also, the grafting reaction remarkably improved the in vitro anti-diabetic activity of inulin. The glucose adsorption capacity and glucose dialysis retardation index of the BCT-g-inulin complex were remarkably higher than those of inulin, while the BCT-g-inulin complex showed much stronger inhibitory effects against &#945;-amylase and &#945;-glucosidase compared with inulin. Notably, the inhibition of both &#945;-amylase and &#945;-glucosidase by the BCT-g-inulin complex occurred through mixed-competitive mode. On the basis of fluorescence spectroscopy, the fluorescence of &#945;-amylase and &#945;-glucosidase could be quenched by the BCT-g-inulin complex through a static quenching mechanism. Hence, the BCT-g-inulin complex might have the potential to be developed as an effective anti-diabetic agent.","Zeng, Xiangquan; Du, Zhenjiao; Ding, Xiaomeng; Zhao, Yunshu; Jiang, Weibo",Food funct,958,16

In this project, we aimed to characterize similarities in dysregulated immune pathways between COVID-19 patients and patients with cardiomyopathy, venous thromboembolism (VTE), or coronary artery disease (CAD). We hypothesized that these similarly dysregulated pathways may be critical to how cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) exacerbate COVID-19. To evaluate immune dysregulation in different diseases, we used four separate datasets, including RNA-sequencing data from human left ventricular cardiac muscle samples of patients with dilated or ischemic cardiomyopathy and healthy controls; RNA-sequencing data of whole blood samples from patients with single or recurrent event VTE and healthy controls; RNA-sequencing data of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with and without obstructive CAD; and RNA-sequencing data of platelets from COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls. We found similar immune dysregulation profiles between patients with CVDs and COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, cardiomyopathy patients display the most similar immune landscape to COVID-19 patients. Additionally, COVID-19 patients experience greater upregulation of cytokine- and inflammasome-related genes than patients with CVDs. In all, patients with CVDs have a significant overlap of cytokine- and inflammasome-related gene expression profiles with that of COVID-19 patients, possibly explaining their greater vulnerability to severe COVID-19.","Lee, Abby C; Castaneda, Grant; Li, Wei Tse; Chen, Chengyu; Shende, Neil; Chakladar, Jaideep; Taub, Pam R; Chang, Eric Y; Ongkeko, Weg M",Viruses,958,24

This additional interaction provides a structural explanation for the increased ACE2 affinity of the N501Y mutant, and likely contributes to its increased infectivity.

Covid-19 attacks not only the lungs, making it difficult to breathe and life-threatening, but also the heart, kidneys, brain and other vital organs of the body, with possible sequela. At present, the detection of COVID-19 needs to be realized by the reverse transcription-polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). However, many countries are in the outbreak period of the epidemic, and the medical resources are very limited. They cannot provide sufficient numbers of gene sequence detection, and many patients may not be isolated and treated in time. Given this situation, we researched the analytical and diagnostic capabilities of deep learning on chest radiographs and proposed Cascade-SEMEnet which is cascaded with SEME-ResNet50 and SEME-DenseNet169. The two cascade networks of Cascade - SEMEnet both adopt large input sizes and SE-Structure and use MoEx and histogram equalization to enhance the data. We first used SEME-ResNet50 to screen chest X-ray and diagnosed three classes: normal, bacterial, and viral pneumonia. Then we used SEME-DenseNet169 for fine-grained classification of viral pneumonia and determined if it is caused by COVID-19. To exclude the influence of non-pathological features on the network, we preprocessed the data with U-Net during the training of SEME-DenseNet169. The results showed that our network achieved an accuracy of 85.6\% in determining the type of pneumonia infection and 97.1\% in the fine-grained classification of COVID-19.

Appropriate use of PPE by healthcare workers is, however, often suboptimal. Training and monitoring of PPE competency are essential components of an infection prevention and control program but there is a paucity of research and data on the content of such training programs across Australasia. This paper reports the results of a survey that characterised the nature of PPE training in Australian and New Zealand hospitals. METHODS: A population-based online survey was distributed to members of three major Australasian colleges representing infection prevention and control. RESULTS: Results indicate that, although training is frequently provided at orientation, many healthcare workers do not receive regular updates. Training programmes combine online and classroom sessions, but over a third do not include a practical component. The frequency of monitoring PPE competency is variable with one third of respondents indicating that no auditing occurs. PPE items used for high-level training are variable, with use of powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) uncommon. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that HCWs' confidence, competence and familiarity with PPE are a concern, which in the context of the current global COVID-19 pandemic is problematic.

According to research, early prediction and prevention can effectively reduce the incidence rate of the disease. However, it is difficult to predict the ischaemic stroke because the data related to the disease are multi-modal. To achieve high accuracy of prediction and combine the stroke risk predictors obtained by previous researchers, a method for predicting the probability of stroke occurrence based on a multi-model fusion convolutional neural network structure is proposed. In such a way, the accuracy of ischaemic stroke prediction is improved by processing multi-modal data through multiple end-to-end neural networks. In this method, the feature extraction of structured data (age, gender, history of hypertension, etc.) and streaming data (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.) based on a convolutional neural network is first realized. A neural network model for feature fusion is then constructed to realize the feature fusion of structured data and streaming data. Finally, a predictive model for predicting the probability of stroke is obtained by training. As shown in the experimental results, the accuracy of ischaemic stroke prediction reached 98.53%. Such a high prediction accuracy will be helpful for preventing the occurrence of stroke.","Liu, Yan; Yin, Bo; Cong, Yanping",,958,16

METHODS: Searching four databases, studies were investigated that described the evolution of pregnancies in women diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection through laboratory tests. A scoping review was undertaken, including 35 articles published in English. Two pairs of independent researchers synthesized the data. RESULTS: Most studies were case studies or case series and had a low risk of bias. A predominance of cases was found in women over the age of 30 years who got infected in the third term of pregnancy and who had comorbidities. The prematurity index varied with the heterogeneity of the samples, and the cases of abortion occurred in combination with severe forms of infection. Caesarean section deliveries predominated, indicated mainly by respiratory decompensation caused by infection. Most women were discharged. CONCLUSION: Based on the reviewed studies, the profile and evolution of pregnant women infected with COVID-19 could be evaluated.","de Oliveira, Karoline Faria; de Oliveira, Jacqueline Faria; Wernet, Monika; Carvalho Paschoini, Marina; Ruiz, Mariana Torreglosa",Int J Nurs Pract,958,17

The sudden increase in the number of patients and deaths from this novel type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic poses a serious challenge to all arenas of health care delivery system. The care of high-time dependent-factor illnesses is essential for the survival of a patient and the need for avoiding impairment of health. The purpose of the review is to highlight that a change in first-aid attitudes can be assumed behind the delay in immediate interventions initiated by first responders during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To maintain socially important first aid, the European Resuscitation Council amended its guidelines on first aid, basic life support and made further recommendations at the time of pandemic on first-aid education, too. For effective domestic adaptation, the present overview summarises the most important aspects of guidelines and their supplements and also covers their practical implementations. The main purpose of the change in guidelines is to bring the willingness of the first responders back to the level before the coronavirus pandemic, and to further enhance it with professional educational materials and modern methods.

The peripheral B cell distributions are similar in healthy persons and MS patients. In healthy controls, B cells are rarely present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) while in MS patients, a clonally expanded B cell population is detected. This consists of memory B cells, centroblasts and antibody-secreting plasma blasts and plasma cells that are responsible for intrathecal immunoglobulin G production and oligoclonal band formation in more than 90% of MS patients. Unfortunately, the targets of the autoreactive B cells and antibodies remain largely unknown. Various candidate antigens have been identified but often their involvement in the disease process is still unclear. Most studies characterizing these target antigens examined autoantibodies by analyzing sera or CSF of MS patients. An alternative approach is focusing on the clonally expanded B cells. In this way B cells directed against myelin, astroglia and axons have been denoted in MS patients. B cell immortalization, that is based on the antibody-producing potential of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) transformed B cells, can be used to expand B cells from MS patients for the production of antibodies, that ultimately can be analysed for target identification.","Fraussen, J.; Vrolix, K.; Martinez-Martinez, P.; Losen, M.; De Baets, M.H.; Stinissen, P.; Somers, V.",Autoimmun Rev,958,20
