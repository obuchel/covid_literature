Scientists working in the area of nucleic acid delivery using lipid nanoparticles will undoubtedly be energized by the success of these vaccines and begin to collect much needed data in the realm of nonviral-based RNA delivery, specifically, the use of lipid nanoparticles, the immune response, safety, and efficacy. It is easily conceivable that in the future we can utilize these data to streamline our approach for the delivery of genes or microRNA mimics or antigomers for gene therapy and therapeutic and regenerative medicine (ie, wound repair) applications, respectively.","Hadjiargyrou, Michael",Nucleic acid therapeutics,904,19

The records of 230 cancer patients were reviewed. Coronaphobia was assessed via the validated COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S). A total of 64% of the patients had a high coronaphobia score. Among them, 59% were noncompliant. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, low educational status, treatment type, following COVID-19 news, having knowledge about COVID-19 transmission and higher C19P-S score were associated with noncompliance (p = 0.006, p < 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that having knowledge about COVID-19 transmission was related to a higher C19P-S score (p = 0.001). The cancer patients studied had significant coronaphobia. Moreover, greater coronaphobia was significantly associated with noncompliance with follow-up and treatment.","Akagunduz, Baran; Ozer, Muhammet; Karacin, Cengiz; Atcı, Muhammed Mustafa; Yıldırım, Hasan Cagrı; Unver, Edhem",Future oncology,904,1

METHODS We examined 154 Internet news-site articles reporting adverse public psychosocial responses in the first 60 days of the outbreak. Rumor-related coverage and exclusive behavior coverage were dichotomously coded as included or not. Moreover, we assessed whether or not health information (eg, coping methods, virus toxicity information) or emphasis on information quality (eg, importance of information, cautions about overreactions) were simultaneously reported. RESULTS Rumor-related coverage (n=120, 77.9%) was less likely to simultaneously report public health information (eg, toxicity information, health support information, and cautions about overreactions; P<.05). Conversely, exclusive behavior coverage (n=41, 26.6%) was more likely to report public health information (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS Rumor-related coverage was less likely to have accompanying public health information, whereas exclusive behavior coverage was more likely to include it. During public health crises, it is essential to understand that rumors and exclusive behaviors have adverse effects on the public and that accompanying public health information may help people take proactive coping actions.","Shigemura, Jun; Harada, Nahoko; Tanichi, Masaaki; Nagamine, Masanori; Shimizu, Kunio; Katsuda, Yoshiaki; Tokuno, Shinichi; Tsumatori, Gentaro; Yoshino, Aihide",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,904,24

Measuring the electrical activity signals in brain using off-the-shelf consumer wearable devices such as smart wristwatch and mapping them in real time to underlying mood, behavioral and emotional changes play striking roles in postulating mental health anomalies. In this work, we propose to implement a wearable, On-device Mental Anomaly Detection (OMAD) system to detect anomalous behaviors and activities that render to mental health problems and help clinicians to design effective intervention strategies. We propose an intrinsic artifact removal model on Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal to better correlate the fine-grained behavioral changes. We design model compression technique on the artifact removal and activity recognition (main) modules. We implement a magnitude-based weight pruning technique both on convolutional neural network and Multilayer Perceptron to employ the inference phase on Nvidia Jetson Nano;one of the tightest resource-constrained devices for wearables. We experimented with three different combinations of feature extractions and artifact removal approaches. We evaluate the performance of OMAD in terms of accuracy, F1 score, memory usage and running time for both unpruned and compressed models using EEG data from both control and treatment (alcoholic) groups for different object recognition tasks. Our artifact removal model and main activity detection model achieved about approximate to 93% and 90% accuracy, respectively with significant reduction in model size (70%) and inference time (31%).","Dey, E.; Roy, N.; Ieee,",2020 Ieee 20th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering,904,1
