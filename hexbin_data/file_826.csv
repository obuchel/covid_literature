We evaluated 4 portable ventilators, Impact EMV, CareFusion LTV 1200, Newport HT70, and Hamilton T1, in terms of triggering, delivered tidal volume (V(T)) accuracy, battery duration, delivered F(IO(2)) accuracy, and gas consumption. METHODS Triggering was tested using a microprocessor controlled breathing simulator that simulated a weak, normal, and aggressive inspiratory effort using muscle pressures of -2, -4, and -8 cm H2O respectively. Delivered V(T) and F(IO(2)) accuracy were evaluated across a range of operation. To determine gas consumption, the ventilators were attached to an E type oxygen cylinder and operated at an F(IO(2)) of 1.0 until the tank was depleted. Battery duration was tested by operating each ventilator at an F(IO(2)) of 0.21 until the device ceased to operate. RESULTS Differences remain among devices in several aspects of the testing protocol. Gas consumption ranged from 9.2 to 16 L/min. Battery duration ranged from 101 to 640 min. Triggering performance varied among devices but was consistent breath to breath within the same device, using the fastest and slowest rise time settings. F(IO(2)) accuracy varied at the low range on the 50 mL V(T) setting with one device, and at the high range on both the 50 mL and 500 mL V(T) settings with another. CONCLUSIONS Manufacturers continue to improve the performance of portable ventilators. All the ventilators we tested performed well on V(T) delivery across a range of settings, using both the internal drive mechanism (F(IO(2)) 0.21) and compressed oxygen (F(IO(2)) 1.0). Two of the ventilators were unable to deliver accurate F(IO(2)) across the range of V(T). None of the devices was clearly superior to the others in all aspects of our evaluation.","Blakeman, Thomas C; Branson, Richard D",Respiratory care,826,4

How should we deal with complicated type IV paraesophageal hernias?",9.258024,3.0821795,2015,"This review provides a detailed look at the attributes and immunologic mechanisms of plasmid DNA vaccines and their utility as laboratory tools as well as potential human vaccines. The immunogenicity and efficacy of DNA vaccines in a variety of preclinical models is used to illustrate how they differ from traditional vaccines in novel ways due to the in situ antigen production and the ease with which they are constructed. The ability to make new DNA vaccines without needing to handle a virulent pathogen or to adapt the pathogen for manufacturing purposes demonstrates the potential value of this vaccine technology for use against emerging and epidemic pathogens. Similarly, personalized anti-tumor DNA vaccines can also readily be made from a biopsy. Because DNA vaccines bias the T-helper (Th) cell response to a Th1 phenotype, DNA vaccines are also under development for vaccines against allergy and autoimmune diseases. The licensure of four animal health products, including two prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases, one immunotherapy for cancer, and one gene therapy delivery of a hormone for a food animal, provides evidence of the efficacy of DNA vaccines in multiple species including horses and pigs. The size of these target animals provides evidence that the somewhat disappointing immunogenicity of DNA vaccines in a number of human clinical trials is not due simply to the larger mass of humans compared with most laboratory animals. The insights gained from the mechanisms of protection in the animal vaccines, the advances in the delivery and expression technologies for increasing the potency of DNA vaccines, and encouragingly potent human immune responses in certain clinical trials, provide insights for future efforts to develop DNA vaccines into a broadly useful vaccine and immunotherapy platform with applications for human and animal health.","Liu, Margaret A",Immunological reviews,826,11
78653,78653,78653,Applying the Exoscope to Lacrimal Surgery: Preliminary Experience.,9.209792,3.1016662,2021-03-18,"PURPOSE Prosthetic infections, although relatively uncommon in hernia surgery, are a source of considerable morbidity and cost. The aims of this experimental study were to assess the influence of the morphological properties of the mesh on bacterial adherence in vitro. The morphological properties assessed were the polymer type, filament type, filament diameter, mesh weight, mean pore size, and the addition of silver chlorhexidine and titanium coatings. In addition, the study assessed the effect on bacterial adherence of adding a commonly used suture to the mesh and compared adherence rates to self-gripping mesh that does not require suture fixation. METHODS Eight commercially sourced flat hernia meshes with different material characteristics were included in the study. These were Prolene(®) (Ethicon(®)), DualMesh(®) (Gore(®)), DualMesh(®) Plus (Gore(®)), Parietex™ ProGrip (Covidien™), TiMesh(®) Light (GfE Medical), Bard(®) Soft Mesh (Bard(®)), Vypro(®) (Ethicon(®)), and Omyra(®) (Braun(®)). Individual meshes were inoculated with Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus with a bacterial inoculum of 10(2) bacteria. To assess the effect of suture material on bacterial adhesion, a sterile piece of commonly used monofilament suture material (2.0 Prolene(®), ZB370 Ethicon(®)) was sutured to selected meshes (chosen to represent different commonly used polymers and/or the presence of an antibacterial coating). Inoculated meshes were incubated for 18 h in tryptone soy broth and then analysed using scanning electron microscopy. A previously validated method for enumeration of bacteria using automated stage movement electron microscopy was used for direct bacterial counting. The final fraction of the bacteria adherent to the mesh was compared between the meshes and for each morphological variable. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the bacterial counts. Tukey's test was used to determine the difference between the different biomaterials in the event the ANOVA was significant. RESULTS Properties that significantly increased the mean bacterial adherence were the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene polymer (P < 0.001); multifilament meshes (P < 0.001); increased filament diameter (P < 0.001); increased mesh weight (P < 0.001); and smaller mean pore size (P < 0.001). In contrast, mesh coating with antibacterial silver chlorhexidine significantly reduced bacterial adhesion (S. epidermidis mean bacterial count 140.7 ± 19.1 SE with DualMesh(®) vs. 2.3 ± 1.2 SE with DualMesh(®) Plus, P < 0.001; S. aureus mean bacterial count 371.7 ± 22.7 SE with DualMesh(®) vs. 19.3 ± 4.7 SE with DualMesh(®) Plus, P = 0.002). The addition of 2.0 Prolene suture material significantly increased the mean number of adherent bacteria independent of the mesh polymer or mesh coating (P = 0.04 to <0.001). CONCLUSION The present study demonstrates the significant influence of the prosthetic load on bacterial adherence. In patients at increased risk of infection, low prosthetic load materials, i.e., lightweight meshes with large pores, may be beneficial. Furthermore self-fixing meshes, which avoid increasing the prosthetic load and antibacterial impregnated meshes, may have an advantage in this setting.","Sanders, D; Lambie, J; Bond, P; Moate, R; Steer, J A",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,826,16

IBV is a member of the Coronaviridae family and the genus Gammacoronavirus. A new infectious bronchitis virus serotype can emerge from only very few amino acid changes within the major peplomer glycoprotein, namely in its S1 part forming the virion spike. Principally, the serotypes are identified by virus neutralization (VN) tests. This study is aimed to investigate the neutralizing efficiency of H52, H120, and 4/91 antiserum against IBV genotypes (IS-1494, IS-720, 793/B, IR-1) recently circulating in Iran. For the first time, we have used cross-neutralization tests for the serological classification of these isolates. In this study, all antisera failed to neutralize all IBV strains. According to the results of our research, cross-protection studies are necessary for the design of a proper vaccination program for IBV circulating genotypes in Iran. The data are useful for the development of new vaccine strategies.

The recent explosion of next generation sequencing protocols has enabled the study of the p53 gene regulatory network (GRN) and underlying mechanisms at an unprecedented depth and scale, helping us to understand precisely how p53 controls gene regulation. Here, we discuss our current understanding of where and how p53 binds to DNA and chromatin, its pioneer-like role, and how this affects gene regulation. We provide an overview of the p53 GRN and the direct and indirect mechanisms through which p53 affects gene regulation. In particular, we focus on delineating the ubiquitous and cell type-specific network of regulatory elements that p53 engages; reviewing our understanding of how, where, and when p53 binds to DNA and the mechanisms through which these events regulate transcription. Finally, we discuss the evolution of the p53 GRN and how recent work has revealed remarkable differences between vertebrates, which are of particular importance to cancer researchers using mouse models.","Sammons, Morgan A; Nguyen, Thuy-Ai T; McDade, Simon S; Fischer, Martin",Nucleic acids research,826,30

Methods This is a single-arm study for a preliminary assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of LEP in patients who experienced progression from prior systemic treatments. Pre-treatment tumor tissues were collected to retrospectively evaluate the expression status of PDL1. Results Thirty-two patients received second-line and above treatment with LEP. Overall, the objective response rate (ORR) was 25%, the disease control rate (DCR) was 78.1%, and the clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 40.5%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.9 months (95% CI: 4.7-5.2 months), and the median overall survival (OS) was 11.0 months (95% CI: 9.6-12.3 months). For tolerability, no grade 5 serious adverse events (AEs) were reported. All patients had any-grade AEs, and 59.3% of the patients experienced grade 3 AEs, while only 1 patient experienced a grade 4 AE of stomach bleeding. Fatigue was the most common AE, followed by hypertension and elevated aminotransferase levels. Retrospective analysis for PDL1 expression revealed that PDL1 positive tumor cells were associated with improved clinical benefits and survival outcomes. Conclusions LEP is a promising alternative as a non-first-line therapeutic regimen for patients with refractory BTC. Furthermore, well-designed prospective clinical trials with a control arm are still needed to obtain more evidences to confirm the efficacy and safety of this particular regimen as well as the role of PDL1 expression.","Lin, Jianzhen; Yang, Xu; Long, Junyu; Zhao, Songhui; Mao, Jinzhu; Wang, Dongxu; Bai, Yi; Bian, Jin; Zhang, Lei; Yang, Xiaobo; Wang, Anqiang; Xie, Fucun; Shi, Weiwei; Yang, Huayu; Pan, Jie; Hu, Ke; Guan, Mei; Zhao, Lin; Huo, Li; Mao, Yilei; Sang, Xinting; Wang, Kai; Zhao, Haitao",Hepatobiliary surgery and nutrition,826,12

Preventing small bowel obstruction from the V-loc® suture in laparoscopic ventral rectopexy.,9.224711,3.041549,2015,"Background Public health measures, such as physical distancing and closure of schools and non-essential services, were rapidly implemented in Canada to interrupt the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We sought to investigate the impact of mitigation measures during the spring wave of COVID-19 on the incidence of other laboratory-confirmed respiratory viruses in Hamilton, Ontario. Methods All nasopharyngeal swab specimens (n=57,503) submitted for routine respiratory virus testing at a regional laboratory serving all acute-care hospitals in Hamilton between January 2010 and June 2020 were reviewed. Testing for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza I-III, adenovirus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus was done routinely using a laboratory-developed polymerase chain reaction multiplex respiratory viral panel. A Bayesian linear regression model was used to determine the trend of positivity rates of all influenza samples for the first 26 weeks of each year from 2010 to 2019. The mean positivity rate of Bayesian inference was compared with the weekly reported positivity rate of influenza samples in 2020. Results The positivity rate of influenza in 2020 diminished sharply following the population-wide implementation of COVID-19 interventions. Weeks 12-26 reported 0% positivity for influenza, with the exception of 0.1% reported in week 13. Conclusion Public health measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with a reduced incidence of other respiratory viruses and should be considered to mitigate severe seasonal influenza and other respiratory virus pandemics.","Zhang, Kevin; Misra, Avika; Kim, Patrick J; Moghadas, Seyed M; Langley, Joanne M; Smieja, Marek",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,826,16

Paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, has an antioxidant effect in the vascular wall. We investigated whether paroxetine reduces myocardial ROS formation and LV remodeling following a MI. In a total of 32 Wistar rats, MI was induced by a 30-min ligation of the left anterior descending artery followed by 7- or 28-day reperfusion. During the 28 days of reperfusion, LV remodeling was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography (n = 20). After 28 days of reperfusion, the susceptibility to ventricular tachycardia was evaluated prior to sacrifice and histological assessment of myocyte cross-sectional area, fibrosis, and presence of myofibroblasts. Myocardial ROS formation was measured with dihydroethidium after 7 days of reperfusion in separate groups (n = 12). Diastolic LV volume, evaluated by MRI (417 ± 60 vs. 511 ± 64 µL, p < 0.05), and echocardiography (515 ± 80 vs. 596 ± 83 µL, p < 0.05) as well as diastolic LV internal diameter evaluated with echocardiography (7.2 ± 0.6 vs. 8.1 ± 0.7 mm, p < 0.05) were lower in the paroxetine group than in controls. Furthermore, myocyte cross-sectional area was reduced in the paroxetine group compared with controls (277 ± 26 vs. 354 ± 23 mm3, p < 0.05) and ROS formation was reduced in the remote myocardium (0.415 ± 0.19 normalized to controls, p < 0.05). However, no differences in the presence of fibrosis or myofibroblasts were observed. Finally, paroxetine reduced the susceptibility to ventricular tachycardia (induced in 2/11 vs. 6/8 rats, p < 0.05). Paroxetine treatment following MI decreases LV remodeling and susceptibility to arrhythmias, probably by reducing ROS formation.","Lassen, Thomas Ravn; Nielsen, Jan Møller; Johnsen, Jacob; Ringgaard, Steffen; Bøtker, Hans Erik; Kristiansen, Steen Buus",Basic research in cardiology,826,17

We sought to determine the efficacy of flow diverting stents (FDSs) to treat aneurysms in this specific location. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our database of prospectively collected information for all patients treated with flow diversion for an unruptured saccular para-ophthalmic aneurysm between September 2009 and January 2016. The aneurysm fundus size, neck size, number and type of FDS, complications, and follow-up data were recorded. RESULTS We identified 74 patients that matched our inclusion criteria. Of these patients, 18 patients were male (24.3%). The average fundus size was 4.8 mm, 11 aneurysms had previous coil occlusions and 63 were treated solely with flow diversion. At an initial angiographic follow-up (mean avg. 3.2 months), 71.8% of the aneurysms were occluded, and at the last follow-up (mean avg. 31.8 months), 88.9% of aneurysms were occluded. One patient suffered permanent morbidity (1.36%) secondary to interruption of the antiplatelet medication and another died (1.36%) secondary to in-stent thrombosis that was also due to an interruption in the antiplatelet medication. CONCLUSION Treatment of saccular para-ophthalmic aneurysms with FDS is feasible and carries a high degree of technical success with low complication rates and excellent rates of aneurysm exclusion.","Bhogal, Pervinder; Hellstern, Victoria; Bäzner, Hansjörg; Ganslandt, Oliver; Henkes, Hans; Aguilar Pérez, Marta",Frontiers in neurology,826,6

Sleeve gastrectomy, a relative new surgical approach, was initially conceived as a restrictive component of the biliopancreatic diversion and duodenal switch in the era of open bariatric surgery. With the advent of minimally invasive surgery in the late 1980s, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has been proposed as a step procedure in high-risk patients, followed by a second step Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion and duodenal switch and, recently, as a standalone bariatric approach. This article reviews the literature and reports the results achieved with LSG performed either as the initial operation for high-risk, high body mass index patients followed by a definitive weight loss operation, or used as a final viable alternative to other well-established bariatric procedures. An extensive literature review was conducted and the information currently available surrounding LSG, such as history, indications and contraindications, mechanism of weight loss, technique and outcomes and controversial issues are discussed. LSG is an accepted procedure for the surgical management of morbid obesity. It is gaining popularity as a primary, staged and revisional operation for its proven safety and simplicity, as well as short-term and mid-term efficacy. Excess weight loss and remission of comorbidities have been reported to take place in a frequency comparable with other well-established procedures. Despite all of the above-mentioned factors, long-term results and larger series are pending.","Abu-Jaish, Wasef; Rosenthal, Raul J",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,826,1

Recently, there have been several promising advances in male contraceptive research. This review will update readers on recent research in both hormonal and nonhormonal approaches to male contraception. Hormonal approaches to male contraception have been stymied by adverse effects, formulations requiring injections or implants, a 5% to10% nonresponse rate, as well as poor understanding of user acceptability. In the last several years, research has focused on novel, orally bioavailable androgens such as dimethandrolone undecanoate and 11β-methyl-19-nor-testosterone. Additionally, combinations of a topical testosterone gel combined with a gel containing segesterone acetate, a potent progestin, have shown promise in clinical trials recently. Simultaneously, significant preclinical progress has been made in several approaches to nonhormonal male contraceptives, including compounds that inhibit sperm motility such as eppin, compounds that inhibit retinoic acid binding or biosynthesis, and reversible approaches to obstruction of the vas deferens. It is imperative for these areas of research to continue making strides so that there is a gamut of contraceptive options for couples to choose from. Some of these approaches will hopefully reach clinical utility soon, greatly improving contraceptive choice for couples.","Thirumalai, Arthi; Amory, John K",Fertility and sterility,826,1

This behavior chiefly relies on the ability to extract information from the speech they hear and combine it with information from the external environment. Most theories assume that this ability critically hinges on the recognition of at least some syntactic structure. Here, we show that child-directed speech allows for semantic inference without relying on explicit structural information. We simulate the process of semantic inference with machine learning applied to large text collections of two different types of speech, child-directed speech versus adult-directed speech. Taking the core meaning of causality as a test case, we find that in child-directed speech causal meaning can be successfully inferred from simple co-occurrences of neighboring words. By contrast, semantic inference in adult-directed speech fundamentally requires additional access to syntactic structure. These results suggest that child-directed speech is ideally shaped for a learner who has not yet mastered syntactic structure.","You, Guanghao; Bickel, Balthasar; Daum, Moritz M; Stoll, Sabine",Scientific reports,826,5

Medical students experienced a greater degree of anxiety and psychological stress than during previous pandemics. Negative emotions were related to decreased medical career interest, increased career choice regret and dropout rates in medical students, which affected academic and professional development. The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of the current COVID-19 outbreak on the career preferences of pediatric medical students and to explore the underlying factors contributing to it. Methods A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted among all 120 pediatric medical students from Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University on November 23rd, 2019, and February 21st, 2020 using a 7-item online questionnaire about career choice. Results A total of 106 (41 male and 65 female) students with a mean age of 21 years consented to participate in this study. The response rate was 100% in November 2019 and 98.1% in February 2020. Since the outbreak, career choices to practice medicine or pediatrics did not drop significantly, decreasing by only 4.3% and 2.2%, respectively. There was a positive impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on strengthening 66.7% of students' beliefs and choices to become good pediatricians (P<0.001). Only 14 students (13.5%) thought that COVID-19 had a negative impact on their career choices, but the majority of them were in the 3rd (28.6%) and 4th (64.3%) years of medical education and had insufficient knowledge about the hospital environment and clinics. Conclusions The outbreak of COVID-19 might have an overall positive impact on career choice by strengthening students' belief and choice to become good doctors and may decrease the choice regret and drop rates of the next generation of doctors. Special attention should be paid to students with insufficient clinical experience. Good protection for students, sharing outstanding stories regarding fighting the pandemic, and innovations of needs-based curriculum could be helpful during this pandemic. Future studies are warranted to confirm these findings.","Hu, Liyuan; Wu, Hao; Zhou, Wenhao; Shen, Jianqing; Qiu, Wenwei; Zhang, Ruo; Wu, Jingyan; Chai, Yiming",Translational pediatrics,826,5

To have a better knowledge of influenza transmission, we carried out a detailed modelling investigation in a nosocomial influenza outbreak in Hong Kong. We identified three hypothesised transmission modes between index patient and other inpatients based on the long-range airborne and fomite routes. We considered three kinds of healthcare workers' routine round pathways in 1140 scenarios with various values of important parameters. In each scenario, we used a multi-agent modelling framework to estimate the infection risk for each hypothesis and conducted least-squares fitting to evaluate the hypotheses by comparing the distribution of the infection risk with that of the attack rates. Amongst the hypotheses tested in the 1140 scenarios, the prediction of modes involving the long-range airborne route fit better with the attack rates, and that of the two-route transmission mode had the best fit, with the long-range airborne route contributing about 94% and the fomite route contributing 6% to the infections. Under the assumed conditions, the influenza virus was likely to have spread via a combined long-range airborne and fomite routes, with the former predominant and the latter negligible.","Xiao, S; Tang, J W; Hui, D S; Lei, H; Yu, H; Li, Y",Epidemiology and infection,826,1

In this paper, antibody sulfhydrylation and protein A were used to modify the microcantilever Au surface, and the antibody activities on the microcantilever were evaluated with direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dcELISA). The activity of the antibodies immobilized on the microcantilever via protein A was 1.7-fold of that via the sulfhydrylation reagent 2-iminothiolane hydrochloride. A microcantilever immunosensor method with protein A as the functionalization reagent was established to detect the residues of clenbuterol and chloramphenicol at limits of detection (LOD) of approximately 0.1 and 0.2 ng/mL, respectively. Such LODs were better than that of the corresponding dcELISAs. The concentration of clenbuterol in a fortified feed sample detected with the microcantilever immunosensor after thorough extraction and purification agreed well with that detected with the dcELISA. Protein A showed to be simple and reproducible for functionalization of the antibodies on the Au surface and, thus, has common application values in microcantilever immunosensor development. The results suggest that microcantilever immunosensors be suitable for detection of small molecules, and the assay sensitivity is mainly related to the quality and activities of the antibodies.","Tan, Weiming; Huang, Yuan; Nan, Tiegui; Xue, Changguo; Li, Zhaohu; Zhang, Qingchuan; Wang, Baomin",Analytical chemistry,826,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS A clinical management protocol including intravenous treatment and mechanical thrombectomy was instigated in our center in 2009 (Prognostic Factors Related to Clinical Outcome Following Thrombectomy in Ischemic Stroke [RECOST] study). All patients with acute ischemic stroke with an anterior circulation major-vessel occlusion who presented within 6 hours were evaluated with an initial MR imaging examination and were analyzed according to age subgroups (younger than 50 years, 50-59 years, 60-69 years, 70-79 years; 80 years or older). The mRS score at 3 months was the study end point. RESULTS One hundred sixty-five patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 67.4 years (range, 29-90 years). The mean baseline NIHSS score was 17.24 (range, 3-27). The mean DWI-derived ASPECTS was 6.4. Recanalization of TICI 2b/3 was achieved in 80%. At 3 months, 41.72% of patients had a good outcome, with a gradation of prognosis depending on the age subgroup and a clear cutoff at 70 years. Only 19% of patients older than 80 years had a good outcome at 3 months (mean ASPECTS = 7.4) with 28% for 70-79 years (mean ASPECTS = 6.8), but 58% for 60-69 years (mean ASPECTS = 6), 52% for 50-59 years (mean ASPECTS = 5.91), and 72% for younger than 50 years (mean ASPECTS = 6.31). In contrast, the mortality rate was 35% for 80 years and older, and 26% for 70-79 versus 5%-9% for younger than 70 years. CONCLUSIONS The elderly may benefit from thrombectomy when their ischemic core volume is low in comparison with younger patients who still benefit from acute recanalization despite larger infarcts. Stroke volume thresholds should, therefore, be related and adjusted to the patient's age group.","Danière, F; Lobotesis, K; Machi, P; Eker, O; Mourand, I; Riquelme, C; Ayrignac, X; Vendrell, J F; Gascou, G; Fendeleur, J; Dargazanli, C; Schaub, R; Brunel, H; Arquizan, C; Bonafé, A; Costalat, V",AJNR.

We analyzed neutralizing antibody responses to egg- and cell-propagated vaccine and circulating viruses following vaccination in 375 individuals (aged 7 months to 82 years) across all vaccine eligible age groups in 3 influenza seasons. Antibody responses to cell- compared to egg-propagated vaccine viruses were significantly reduced due to egg-adapted changes T160K, D225G, and L194P in the vaccine hemagglutinins. Vaccine egg-adaptation had differential impact on antibody responses across different age groups. Immunologically naive children immunized with egg-adapted vaccines mostly mounted antibodies targeting egg-adapted epitopes, whereas those previously primed with infection produced broader responses even when vaccinated with egg-based vaccines. In elderly, repeated boost of vaccine egg-adapted epitopes significantly reduced antibody responses to the wild type cell-grown viruses. Analysis with reverse genetics viruses suggested that the response to each egg-adapted substitution varied by age. Antibody responses did not differ in male versus female vaccinees. Here, the combination of age-specific responses to vaccine egg-adapted substitutions, diverse host immune priming histories and virus antigenic drift impacted antibody responses following vaccination and may have led to the low and variable VE against A(H3N2) viruses across different age groups.","Liu, Feng; Gross, F Liaini; Jefferson, Stacie N; Holiday, Crystal; Bai, Yaohui; Wang, Li; Zhou, Bin; Levine, Min Z",The Journal of clinical investigation,826,8

The Stroke Unit-Commission of the German Stroke Society and the German Atrial Fibrillation NETwork (AFNET) endorsed this paper. Cardiac imaging is a key component of etiological work-up after stroke. Enhanced echocardiographic tools, constantly improving cardiac computer tomography (CT) as well as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer comprehensive non- or less-invasive cardiac evaluation at the expense of increased costs and/or radiation exposure. Certain imaging findings usually lead to a change in medical secondary stroke prevention or may influence medical treatment. However, there is no proof from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that the choice of the imaging method influences the prognosis of stroke patients. Summarizing present knowledge, the German Heart and Brain consortium proposes an interdisciplinary, staged standard diagnostic scheme for the detection of risk factors of cardio-embolic stroke. This expert opinion paper aims to give practical advice to physicians who are involved in stroke care. In line with the nature of an expert opinion paper, labeling of classes of recommendations is not provided, since many statements are based on expert opinion, reported case series, and clinical experience.","Schnabel, Renate B; Camen, Stephan; Knebel, Fabian; Hagendorff, Andreas; Bavendiek, Udo; Böhm, Michael; Doehner, Wolfram; Endres, Matthias; Gröschel, Klaus; Goette, Andreas; Huttner, Hagen B; Jensen, Christoph; Kirchhof, Paulus; Korosoglou, Grigorios; Laufs, Ulrich; Liman, Jan; Morbach, Caroline; Nabavi, Darius Günther; Neumann-Haefelin, Tobias; Pfeilschifter, Waltraud; Poli, Sven; Rizos, Timolaos; Rolf, Andreas; Röther, Joachim; Schäbitz, Wolf Rüdiger; Steiner, Thorsten; Thomalla, Götz; Wachter, Rolf; Haeusler, Karl Georg",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,826,19

The worldwide spread of the disease has led to a public health quarantine where health care professionals are at high risk of infection. In this context, telemedicine has been promoted and scaled up to reduce the risk of transmission. This study aims to demonstrate that a combined framework based on telematics and in-person clinical encounter not only ensures medical care but the safety of healthcare professionals and patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Descriptive observational study on the follow-up of patients during the COVID19 Pandemic, combining telephone and traditional. RESULTS: A total of 5031 telephone calls were made, differentiating between medical referrals, specialized primary care visits, and outpatient consultation. They were classified as successful, required an in-person visit, or no successful telephone contact. Furthermore, we divided them into 2 groups: resolved and unresolved. 53% of all telematic visits were successful. CONCLUSIONS: Telematic medical systems are a feasible option in a orthopedics department and an interesting resource to preserve once the pandemic is resolved. Future lines of research should be opened to improve system success, analyze its cost-effectiveness ratio, and correct any legal conflicts that may exist.","Miguela Álvarez, S M; Bartra Ylla, A; Salvador Carreño, J; Castillón, P; García Cardona, C; Anglès Crespo, F",Rev. esp. cir. ortop. traumatol.
