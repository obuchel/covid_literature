We present our successful experience with ECMO utilized in a respiratory failure patient with H7N9 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44 years-old female with H7N9-induced ARDS was admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and was treated with veno-venous ECMO for six days, antiviral therapy, prolonged corticosteroid infusion and other therapies. She suffered significant hemorrhage requiring transfusion of platelets and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii infection during ECMO support. Bleeding and infection almost killed the patient's life. Fortunately, she was alive at last and completly recovered after 38 days of ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: ECMO was effective in this H7N9 patient with a fatal respiratory failure. Mechanical circulatory support was the only chance for our patient with H7N9-associated ARDS to survive until respiratory function recovery. Early detection and rapid response are essential to these serious ECMO-associated complications such as hemorrhage, thrombosis and infection.","Nie, Qi; Zhang, Ding-yu; Wu, Wen-juan; Huang, Chao-lin; Ni, Zheng-yi",BMC Pulm Med,363,0

In immunocompetent individuals, the infection is usually subclinical but it can sometimes be life threatening. We describe a case of fatal CMV proctitis in a 71-year-old man following an Ivor–Lewis esophagectomy. After surgery he developed renal failure, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. He recovered but developed melena and massive fresh rectal bleeding. Sigmoidoscopy revealed severe proctitis and a biopsy was consistent with ischemia. Despite undergoing a proctectomy he continued to bleed and died despite every effort. The final histological examination of the rectum revealed a CMV infection.","Alam, Imran; Shanoon, Divina; Alhamdani, Ali; Boyd, A.; Griffiths, A.P.; Baxter, J.N.",Surg Today,363,22

This study, preliminarily investigated whether Rabies virus employs epigenetic mechanism for the suppression of the interferon using the Challenge virus standard (CVS) strain and Nigerian street Rabies virus (SRV) strain. Mice were challenged with Rabies virus (RABV) infection, and presence of RABV antigen was assessed by direct fluorescent antibody test (DFAT). A real time quantitative Polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of type II interferon gamma (IFNG) and methylation specific quantitative PCR for methylation analysis of 1FNG promoter region. Accordingly, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes activities were determined. RABV antigen was detected in all infected samples. A statistically significant increase (p < 0.05) in mRNA level of IFNG was observed at the onset of the disease and a decrease as the disease progressed. An increase in methylation in the test groups from the control group was observed, with a fluctuation in methylation as the disease progressed. DNMT and HAT activities also agree with methylation as there was an observed increase activity in test group compared with control group. Similar fluctuation pattern was observed in both CVS and SRV groups as the disease progressed with HAT, being the most active proportionally. This study suggests that epigenetic modification via DNA methylation and histone acetylation may have played a role in the expression of type II interferon gamma in Rabies virus infection.

We apply a novel clinical severity score and examine associations with the odds of being severe and differences in raw severity scores. We find no difference in severity between 0-, 1-, and 2-concurrent infections and little differences in severity between specific viruses. We find RSV and HMPV infections to be associated with 2- and 1.5-fold increase in odds of being severe, respectively, and that infection with ADV is consistently associated with lower risk of severity. Clinically, based on the results here, if RSV or HMPV virus is suspected, PCR testing for confirmatory diagnosis and for detection of multiple coinfecting viruses would be fruitful to assess whether a patient’s disease course is going to be severe.","Althouse, Benjamin M.; Flasche, Stefan; Toizumi, Michiko; Nguyen, Hien-Anh Thi; Vo, Hien Minh; Le, Minh Nhat; Hashizume, Masahiro; Ariyoshi, Koya; Anh, Dang Duc; Rodgers, Gail L.; Klugman, Keith P.; Hu, Hao; Yoshida, Lay-Myint",Sci Rep,363,16

The study used a mixed-method design involving four methods (document review, key informant interviews, organisational survey focus groups). Findings are presented following a systems change analytical framework that included (1) an emerging vision for local refugee support in the Waterloo Region, (2) the adaptation of local structures, (3) the emergence of collaborative processes and (4) an overall assessment of impact. Three main lessons are discussed. The first lesson demonstrates how local systems change is negotiated within a broader migration landscape (contextualizing local systems change). The second lesson acknowledges that a community’s historical migration response can be a springboard for local change (initiating local systems change). The third lesson suggests that expanding and coordinating community engagement in the refugee support system is integral for lasting change (sustaining local systems change). Combined, these lessons provide a comprehensive analysis into how local communities can be adaptive in supporting refugee newcomers.","Janzen, Rich; Leis, Kyla English; Ochocka, Joanna",J Int Migr Integr,363,3

Particularly in Northern Ireland, where 10% of the population live in food insecure households, the pandemic has potentially further exacerbated the nutritional challenges experienced by low-income families. This paper aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on food-related decisions as experienced by economically disadvantaged families in Northern Ireland, UK. METHODS: A qualitative study collected data through online individual interviews. Participation was open to parents of children 2–17 years old who self-identified as living on a tight budget in urban and rural areas of Northern Ireland. A sampling matrix enabled equal representation of single- and two-parent households, as well as younger (<12 y) and older children (>12 y). Photovoice and participatory mapping techniques were employed to capture participant data. A thematic approach was utilised for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 12 interviews were conducted. Five distinct themes were found, reflecting families’ food-related decisions that were affected by the COVID-19 lockdown: 1) food planning; 2) food purchasing; 3) meal preparation; 4) eating and feeding behaviours and 5) eating food prepared outside the house. Changes included an increase in home food preparation, but also in unhealthy snacking. Fear of being exposed to carriers of the virus led to infrequent food shopping and greater reliance on supermarket home deliveries. Long waiting times in-between food shops encouraged food planning but were also a barrier to providing daily fresh foods including fruit and vegetables to their families. Financial constraints were exacerbated during lockdown and led to a search for new ways to budget when food shopping. Food donations from the community and the government were important to maintain food security, particularly in single-parent families. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that the COVID-19 lockdown influenced a broad range of dietary decisions of economically disadvantaged families and offers an insight into the nutritional challenges they experienced. FUNDING SOURCES: The work was completed with financial support from internal funds of Queens University Belfast.","Spyreli, Eleni; McKinley, Michelle; Woodside, Jayne; Kelly, Colette",Curr Dev Nutr,363,6

This research examines how the salience of this knowledge influences consumer judgments. Two important characteristics of our research paradigm are especially relevant to digital contexts: (1) judgements made by the consumers are neither observable nor subject to others’ disapproval; and (2) consensus is not observable or verifiable. Nevertheless, in six main studies and one auxiliary study (Web Appendix), we found that high knowledge salience of others also evaluating reduced judgment extremity. Judgment extremity is quantified by the degree or strength of an evaluation or numeric estimate about a judgment target. This effect was driven by consumers’ tendency to predict a moderate consensus and to conform to this perception. Implications for marketing research and crowdsourcing are discussed.

The goal of this study was to assess patients' experiences receiving sleep care by telehealth. METHODS From June 2019 to May 2020, the authors recruited a sample of patients for semi-structured interviews, including patients who had one of three types of telehealth encounters in sleep medicine: in-clinic video, home-based video, and telephone. Two analysts coded transcripts using content analysis and identified themes that cut across patients and categories. RESULTS The authors conducted interviews with 35 patients and identified five themes. 1) Improved access to care: Patients appreciated telehealth as providing access to sleep care in a timely and convenient manner. 2) Security and Privacy: Patients described how home-based telehealth afforded them greater feelings of safety and security due to avoidance of anxiety provoking triggers (e.g. crowds). Patients also noted a potential loss of privacy with telehealth. 3) Personalization of care: Patients described experiences with telehealth care that either improved or hindered their ability to communicate their needs. 4) Patient Empowerment: Patients described how telehealth empowered them to manage their sleep disorders. 5) Unmet Needs: Patients recognized specific areas where telehealth did not meet their needs, including the need for tangible services (e.g. mask fitting). CONCLUSION Patients expressed both positive and negative experiences, highlighting areas where telehealth can be further adapted. As telehealth in sleep medicine continues to evolve, the authors encourage providers to consider these aspects of the patient experience.","Donovan, Lucas M; Mog, Ashley C; Blanchard, Kelly N; Magid, Kate H; Syed, Adnan S; Kelley, Lynette R; Palen, Brian N; Parsons, Elizabeth C; McCall, Catherine C; Thompson, William; Charlton, Matthew; Spece, Laura J; Kirsh, Susan; Au, David H; Sayre, George G",Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,363,19

METHODS A prospective observational single-center study was performed, including all antenatal and parturient women admitted from April to August 2020. Data were collected regarding number of admissions, deliveries, antenatal visits, reason for inaccessibility of health care, and complications during pregnancy, and compared with data from the pre-COVID period of October 2019 to February 2020. RESULTS There was a reduction of 45.1% in institutional deliveries (P<0.001), a percentage point increase of 7.2 in high-risk pregnancy, and 2.5-fold rise in admission to the intensive care unit of pregnant women during the pandemic. One-third of women had inadequate antenatal visits. The main reason for delayed health-seeking was lockdown and fear of contracting infection, resulting in 44.7% of pregnancies with complications. Thirty-two symptomatic women who tested positive for COVID-19 were managed at the center with good maternal and fetal outcomes.

STUDY DESIGN Survey study. METHODS An anonymous and voluntary survey approved by the Otolaryngology Program Directors Organization was administered to academic faculty members from April 24, 2020 through May 19, 2020. RESULTS Two hundred fifty-seven surveys were received from department chairs (17.5%), program directors (24.1%), associate program directors (12.5%), and department faculty (45.9%). USMLE Step 1 has been the most heavily weighted metric for offering interviews (44.0%), and it has correlated with residents' medical knowledge (77.0%) and in-service performance (79.8%) but not with surgical skills (57.6%) or patient care (47.1%). In total, 68.1% disagreed with the decision to make USMLE Step 1 pass/fail. This change is anticipated to lead to an increase in significance of USMLE Step 2 CK (89.1%), core clerkship grades (80.9%), elective rotation at the respective institutions (65.7%), Alpha Omega Alpha and other awards (64.6%), and letters of recommendation (63.8%). The new scoring is also anticipated to especially benefit students from top-ranked schools (70.8%), increase medical students' anxiety/uncertainty regarding obtaining interview invites (59.1%), and negatively affect international (51.4%), doctor of osteopathic medicine (45.9%), and underrepresented students (36.9%).

Many of these minimally invasive techniques have gained universal acceptance by demonstrating improved patient outcomes. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) was developed with the aim of reducing the invasiveness of traditional laparoscopy. Laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) herniorrhaphy via the three-trocar technique is widely used for recurrent inguinal hernia. To the author's knowledge, this report describes first series of SILS TAPP for recurrent inguinal hernia repair. METHODS From April 2009 to March 2010, 15 single-incision laparoscopic TAPP repairs of recurrent inguinal hernia were performed by the same surgical team. The data collected prospectively included patient demographics, type of hernia, operative time, complications, postoperative hospital stay, and recurrence. The umbilicus was the sole point of entry for all patients using a single port, and the same operative technique was used in all cases. RESULTS The SILS TAPP procedure was performed successfully for all the patients, and none required conversion to an open procedure or a conventional laparoscopic hernia repair by the addition of more entry ports. The mean operative time was 51 ± 17 min. No intra- or postoperative complications were recorded. There was no evidence of early recurrence during a mean follow-up period of 130 ± 77 days. CONCLUSION Based on this experience, the author believes that SILS approach is technically feasible and safe using standard and slightly modified instruments for standard TAPP. The cosmetic benefit is clear, but the advantages of SILS TAPP over conventional laparoscopic surgery during long-term follow-up evaluation will require further randomized clinical trials.","Kucuk, Can",Surgical endoscopy,363,0

Based on the literature background presented, two hypotheses were examined: First, autonomy help-seeking orientation, the authoritative parenting style, and high subjective well-being would be positive predictors of parental self-efficacy. Second, dependent help-seeking orientation and non-authoritative parenting styles are negative predictors of parental self-efficacy. One hundred and thirty-two parents of school-age children answered questionnaires measuring the research and background variables. A multivariate regression analysis found that the independent variables explain about 53% of the variance of the parental self-efficacy scores, with subjective well-being and the authoritative parenting style being uniquely associated with high parental self-efficacy, and the permissive parenting style being uniquely associated with low parental self-efficacy. The present study focuses on parental self-efficacy as an important parental component, demonstrating the personal characteristics of parents that may affect their perceived efficacy, and offers an integrative portrait of factors that can describe parents' attitudes and behavior toward their competence as parents.

Women's groups are voluntary groups, which aim to improve the well-being of members through activities, such as joint savings, credit, livelihoods development and/or health activities. Health interventions are increasingly added on to existing women's economic groups as a public health intervention for women and their families. Here, we present the protocol for a mixed-methods systematic review we will conduct of the evidence on integrated economic and health interventions on women's groups to assess whether and how they improve health-related knowledge, behaviour and outcomes in LMICs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search seven electronic databases for published literature, along with manual searches and consultation. The review will include (1) randomised trials and non-randomised quasiexperimental studies of intervention effects of integrated economic and health interventions delivered through women's groups in LMICs, and (2) sibling studies that examine factors related to intervention content, context, implementation processes and costs. We will appraise risk of bias and study quality using standard tools. High and moderate quality studies will be grouped by health domain and synthesised without meta-analysis. Qualitative evidence will be thematically synthesised and integrated into the quantitative synthesis using a matrix approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This protocol was reviewed and deemed exempt by the institutional review board at the American Institutes for Research. Findings will be shared through peer-reviewed publication and disseminated with programme implementers and policymakers engaged with women's groups.

Since in vitro models recapitulating this are limited, the aims of this study were to develop mixed macrovesicular steatosis in immortalized hepatocytes and investigate effects on intracellular metabolism by altering nutritional substrates. METHODS Huh7 cells were cultured in 11 mM glucose and 2% human serum (HS) for 7 days before additional sugars and fatty acids (FAs), either with 200 µM FAs (low fat low sugar; LFLS), 5.5 mM fructose + 200 µM FAs (low fat high sugar; LFHS), or 5.5 mM fructose + 800 µM FAs (high fat high sugar; HFHS), were added for 7 days. FA metabolism, lipid droplet characteristics, and transcriptomic signatures were investigated. RESULTS Between the LFLS and LFHS conditions, there were few notable differences. In the HFHS condition, intracellular triacylglycerol (TAG) was increased and the LD pattern and distribution was similar to that found in primary steatotic hepatocytes. HFHS-treated cells had lower levels of de novo-derived FAs and secreted larger, TAG-rich lipoprotein particles. RNA sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis showed changes in several pathways including those involved in metabolism and cell cycle. CONCLUSIONS Repeated doses of HFHS treatment resulted in a cellular model of NAFLD with a mixed macrovesicular LD pattern and metabolic dysfunction. Since these nutrients have been implicated in the development of NAFLD in humans, the model provides a good physiological basis for studying NAFLD development or regression in vitro.","Gunn, Pippa J; Pramfalk, Camilla; Millar, Val; Cornfield, Thomas; Hutchinson, Matthew; Johnson, Elspeth M; Nagarajan, Shilpa R; Troncoso-Rey, Perla; Mithen, Richard F; Pinnick, Katherine E; Traka, Maria H; Green, Charlotte J; Hodson, Leanne",Physiological reports,363,27

The presence of myocardial fibrosis provides both anatomical and functional barriers that promote arrhythmias in these patients. Propagation of VT in a reentrant circuit depends on the presence of excitable myocardium and the refractoriness of the circuit. We hypothesize that myocardial refractoriness can be modulated surgically in a model of HFrEF, leading to decreased susceptibility to VT.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were infarcted via permanent left coronary artery ligation. At 3 weeks post-infarction, engineered grafts composed of human dermal fibroblasts cultured into a polyglactin-910 biomaterial were implanted onto the epicardium to cover the area of infarction. Three weeks post-graft treatment, all rats underwent a terminal electrophysiologic study to compare monophasic action potential electroanatomic maps and susceptibility to inducible monomorphic VT.HFrEF rats (n=29) demonstrated a longer (p=0.0191) ventricular effective refractory period (ERP) and a greater (p=0.0394) VT inducibility compared with sham (n=7). HFrEF rats treated with the graft (n=12) exhibited no change in capture threshold (p=0.3220), but had a longer ventricular ERP (p=0.0029) compared with HFrEF. No statistically significant change in VT incidence was found between HFrEF rats treated with the graft and untreated HFrEF rats (p=0.0834).Surgical deployment of a fibroblast-containing biomaterial in a rodent ischemic cardiomyopathy model prolonged ventricular ERP as measured by programmed electrical stimulation. This hypothesis-generating study warrants additional studies to further characterize the antiarrhythmic or proarrhythmic effects of this novel surgical therapy.","Chinyere, Ikeotunye Royal; Hutchinson, Mathew; Moukabary, Talal; Koevary, Jen Watson; Juneman, Elizabeth; Goldman, Steven; Lancaster, Jordan J",Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,363,16

To initiate replication, viruses have developed powerful evasion strategies to counteract host IFN responses. In the present study, we found that the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) NS5 protein could inhibit double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-induced IFN-β expression in a dose-dependent manner. Our data further demonstrated that JEV NS5 suppressed the activation of the IFN transcriptional factors IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-κB. However, there was no defect in the phosphorylation of IRF3 and degradation of IκB, an upstream inhibitor of NF-κB, upon NS5 expression, indicating a direct inhibition of the nuclear localization of IRF3 and NF-κB by NS5. Mechanistically, NS5 was shown to interact with the nuclear transport proteins KPNA2, KPNA3, and KPNA4, which competitively blocked the interaction of KPNA3 and KPNA4 with their cargo molecules, IRF3 and p65, a subunit of NF-κB, and thus inhibited the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-κB. Furthermore, overexpression of KPNA3 and KPNA4 restored the activity of IRF3 and NF-κB and increased the production of IFN-β in NS5-expressing or JEV-infected cells. Additionally, an upregulated replication level of JEV was shown upon KPNA3 or KPNA4 overexpression. These results suggest that JEV NS5 inhibits the induction of type I IFN by targeting KPNA3 and KPNA4.IMPORTANCE JEV is the major cause of viral encephalitis in South and Southeast Asia, with high mortality. However, the molecular mechanisms contributing to the severe pathogenesis are poorly understood. The ability of JEV to counteract the host innate immune response is potentially one of the mechanisms responsible for JEV virulence. Here we demonstrate the ability of JEV NS5 to interfere with the dsRNA-induced nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-κB by competitively inhibiting the interaction of IRF3 and NF-κB with nuclear transport proteins. Via this mechanism, JEV NS5 suppresses the induction of type I IFN and the antiviral response in host cells. These findings reveal a novel strategy for JEV to escape the host innate immune response and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of JEV.","Ye, Jing; Chen, Zheng; Li, Yunchuan; Zhao, Zikai; He, Wen; Zohaib, Ali; Song, Yunfeng; Deng, Chenglin; Zhang, Bo; Chen, Huanchun; Cao, Shengbo",Journal of virology,363,26

METHODS Data comes from 59 population-based cancer registries in 22 countries. KS was defined as ICD-O-3 morphology code 9140 combined with any topography code. Crude and age-adjusted incidence rates and relative survival for years of diagnosis 2000-2007 and with trends during 1995-2007 were calculated overall, by age and by country. RESULTS The crude annual incidence rate was 0.28 per 100,000 and age-adjusted incidence was 0.23 per 100,000; incidence increased with age, from 0.18/100,000 at age 0-44 to 0.25/100,000 at age 45-64 and 0.69/100,000 at age 65 and over. Age-adjusted incidence in males was more than four times that in females. Portugal, which had the highest incidence of AIDS in Europe, had by far the highest incidence of KS at age 0-44, 1.44/100,000, more than four times the rate in any other country. Incidence among males in Europe aged 0-44 fell significantly between 1995-1998 and 1999-2002, followed by a significant increase in 2003-2007. Younger patients, with predominantly AIDS-related KS, formerly had a worse prognosis, but since 1999-2001 5-year relative survival increased for patients aged under 65, and by 2005-2007 was 83-86 % for all three age groups 0-44, 45-64, and 65 and over. CONCLUSION Survival and quality of life for the increasing number of people in Europe affected by KS should improve further following the development of evidence-based guidelines for its management. Population-based cancer registries will continue to play a vital role in monitoring the burden of KS and improvements in its outcome.","Stiller, Charles A; Botta, Laura; Sánchez Perez, Maria José; Chirlaque López, María Dolores; Marcos-Gragera, Rafael; Scuderi, Tiziana; Huws, Dyfed Wyn; Trama, Annalisa",Cancer epidemiology,363,19

Scenes were classified as high- or low-complexity by the number of unique object categories depicted. We found that recognition of high-complexity, but not low-complexity, scenes increased with age. Age was associated with decreased alpha power and increased instantaneous alpha frequency during the encoding of subsequently recognized high-compared to low-complexity scenes. Critically, decreased alpha power predicted improved recognition of high-complexity scenes in adolescents. These findings demonstrate how the functional maturation of the occipital cortex supports the development of memory for complex visual scenes.","Yin, Qin; Johnson, Elizabeth L; Tang, Lingfei; Auguste, Kurtis I; Knight, Robert T; Asano, Eishi; Ofen, Noa",Neuropsychologia,363,16

The present study was designed to assess the therapeutic effects and the possible underlying mechanism of action of Manjarix, a herbal combination composed of ginger and turmeric powder extracts, on chemically induced osteoarthritis in rats. An OA model was generated by intra-articular injection of 50 μL (40 mg mL-1) of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) into the right knee joint of rats. After one week of osteoarthritis induction, a comparison of the anti-inflammatory efficacy of indomethacin at an oral dose of 2 mg kg-1 daily for 4 successive weeks versus five decremental dose levels of Manjarix (1000, 500, 250, 125, and 62.5 mg kg-1) was performed. Serum inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha; C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were measured, along with weekly assessment of the knee joint swelling. Pain-like behavior was assessed and knee radiographic and histological examination were performed to understand the extent of pain due to cartilage degradation. Manjarix significantly reduced the knee joint swelling, decreased the serum levels of IL6, TNF-α, CTX-II and HA, and reduced the pathological injury in joints, with no evidence of osteo-reactivity in the radiographic examination. Manjarix also significantly prevented MIA-induced pain behavior. These results demonstrate that Manjarix exhibits chondroprotective effects and can inhibit the OA pain induced by MIA, and thus it can be used as a potential therapeutic product for OA.","Abdel-Rahman, Rehab F; Abd-Elsalam, Reham M; Amer, Mohammed S; El-Desoky, Ahmed M; Mohamed, Shanaz O",Food & function,363,16

The DNA sequence is first converted to a 59-dimensional feature vector where each element corresponds to the relative synonymous usage frequency of a codon. As the input to the classifier is independent of sequence length and variance, our approach is useful when the sequences to be classified are of different lengths, a condition that homology-based methods tend to fail. The method is demonstrated by using 1,841 Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) sequences which are classified into two major classes: HLA-I and HLA-II; each major class is further subdivided into sub-groups of HLA-I and HLA-II molecules. Using codon usage frequencies, binary SVM achieved accuracy rate of 99.3% for HLA major class classification and multi-class SVM achieved accuracy rates of 99.73% and 98.38% for sub-class classification of HLA-I and HLA-II molecules, respectively.

After surveillance carried out in 2009 and 2010, some farmers started vaccinating quail with the Massachusetts avian infectious bronchitis virus serotype. The samples for this study were collected in 2013 from São Paulo state in southeastern Brazil. Pools of trachea, lungs, reproductive tract, kidneys, and enteric contents from quail and laying hens kept in the same farms and from quail-only farms as well as from both healthy birds and those showing infectious bronchitis-like symptoms were sampled in this study. The samples were screened using nested RT-PCR targeting the 3'-untranslated region of the Gammacoronavirus genus. Based on the DNA sequence for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, the strains isolated from quail clustered within either the Gammacoronavirus or Deltacoronavirus genus, and sequences from both genera were found in one quail sample. The phylogeny based on the partial S1 subunit sequence showed that the gammacoronaviruses detected in quail and layers belonged to the Brazil type. These results suggest that quail are susceptible to Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus viruses and indicate that the Massachusetts vaccination was not controlling IBV in quail or chickens.","Torres, C A; Hora, A S; Tonietti, P O; Taniwaki, S A; Cecchinato, M; Villarreal, L Y B; Brandão, P E",Avian diseases,363,27

Our goal is to determine the impact of hand hygiene noncompliance among peripatetic (eg, highly mobile or highly connected) healthcare workers compared with less-connected workers. METHODS We used a mote-based sensor network to record contacts among healthcare workers and patients in a 20-bed intensive care unit. The data collected from this network form the basis for an agent-based simulation to model the spread of nosocomial pathogens with various transmission probabilities. We identified the most- and least-connected healthcare workers. We then compared the effects of hand hygiene noncompliance as a function of connectedness. RESULTS The data confirm the presence of peripatetic healthcare workers. Also, agent-based simulations using our real contact network data confirm that the average number of infected patients was significantly higher when the most connected healthcare worker did not practice hand hygiene and significantly lower when the least connected healthcare workers were noncompliant.

Moreover, the importance of advanced imaging in these patients has not been comprehensively assessed. Purpose To estimate the frequency of radiographically occult hip fracture in elderly patients, to define the higher-risk subpopulation, and to determine the diagnostic performance of CT and bone scanning in the detection of occult fractures by using MRI as the reference standard. Materials and Methods A literature search was performed to identify English-language observational studies published from inception to September 27, 2018. Studies were included if patients were clinically suspected to have hip fracture but there was no radiographic evidence of surgical hip fracture (including absence of any definite fracture or only presence of isolated greater trochanter [GT] fracture). The rate of surgical hip fracture was reported in each study in which MRI was used as the reference standard. The pooled rate of occult fracture, diagnostic performance of CT and bone scanning, and strength of evidence (SOE) were assessed. Results Thirty-five studies were identified (2992 patients; mean age, 76.8 years ± 6.0 [standard deviation]; 66% female). The frequency of radiographically occult surgical hip fracture was 39% (1110 of 2835 patients; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 35%, 43%) in studies of patients with no definite radiographic fracture and 92% (134 of 157 patients; 95% CI: 83%, 98%) in studies of patients with radiographic evidence of isolated GT fracture (moderate SOE). The frequency of occult fracture was higher in patients aged at least 80 years (44%, 529 of 1184), those with an equivocal radiographic report (58%, 71 of 126), and those with a history of trauma (41%, 977 of 2370) (moderate SOE). CT and bone scanning yielded comparable diagnostic performance in the detection of radiographically occult hip fracture (P = .67), with a sensitivity of 79% and 87%, respectively (low SOE). Conclusion Elderly patients with acute hip pain and negative or equivocal findings at initial radiography have a high frequency of occult hip fractures. Therefore, the performance of advanced imaging (preferably MRI) may be clinically appropriate in all such patients. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.","Haj-Mirzaian, Arya; Eng, John; Khorasani, Ramin; Raja, Ali S; Levin, Adam S; Smith, Stacy E; Johnson, Pamela T; Demehri, Shadpour",Radiology,363,1

PET/CT images showed reduced (18)F-FDG uptake in tumors, which correlated with a marked increase in survival after treatment with approximately 4 MBq of (166)Ho-MSNs. CONCLUSION The retention of holmium in nanoparticles during irradiation and in vivo after intraperitoneal administration as well as their efficacy in extending survival in tumor-bearing mice underscores their potential as a radiotherapeutic agent for ovarian cancer metastasis.","Di Pasqua, Anthony J; Yuan, Hong; Chung, Younjee; Kim, Jin-Ki; Huckle, James E; Li, Chenxi; Sadgrove, Matthew; Tran, Thanh Huyen; Jay, Michael; Lu, Xiuling","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",363,24

Moreover, unexplained OD is an early biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases and increases 5-year mortality risk. Structural alterations in olfactory eloquent brain regions may represent the neuroanatomical correlates of OD. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced gray matter (GM) volume in areas of presumed olfactory relevance in patients with OD. However, being cross-sectional in nature, these studies do not provide evidence of causality, for which longitudinal work is required. At present, however, longitudinal studies addressing olfactory structural plasticity are limited, both in number and methodological approach: to our knowledge, such work has not included parallel functional imaging to confirm the relevance of structural change. We therefore performed a longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging study investigating structural and functional plasticity in 24 patients undergoing surgical treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis, compared with 17 healthy controls. We demonstrated functionally significant structural plasticity within the orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate and insular cortices, and temporal poles in patients 3 months after surgery. Of interest, GM volume decreased in these regions, in association with increased psychophysical scores and BOLD signal. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate both structural and functional plasticity of the central olfactory networks, thereby confirming these areas as neuroanatomical correlates of olfactory function/dysfunction.","Whitcroft, Katherine L; Noltus, Jan; Andrews, Peter; Hummel, Thomas",Journal of neuroscience research,363,5

The purpose of this study is to estimate the seroprevalence of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 among workers in the University Hospi-tal of Guadeloupe and to assess this seroprevalence in asymptomatic personnel as well as the proportion of asymptomatic agents among seropositive agents. Setting and methods We carried out a seroprevalence study in the staff of the University Hospital of Guadeloupe. The presence of IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 was determined by a micro-particulate immunolo-gical assay using the chemiluminescence technique (CMIA, Architect i2000SR, Abbott). Data on the previous presence of symptoms sugge-stive of COVID-19, were identified using a standardized questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed using Epi Info® software. Results From 07/05/2020 to 28/10/2020, 892 serologies were performed, 45 of which were positive for SARS-CoV-2 : a prevalence of 5.0% [95% CI: 3.6% - 6.5%]. Seroprevalence was 1.5% [95% CI: 0.6% - 2.3%] among agents who reported being asymptomatic. Among seropositive individuals, 24.4% [95% CI:12% - 36%] was totally asymptomatic. Conclusion Our results highlight the importance of continuing seroprevalence studies for SARS-CoV-2 in hospital staff, which can provide important information on the level of exposure in healthcare workers and asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical set-tings.","Palmeri, V; Le Turdu-Chicot, C; Garin, B; Auguste, A; Roger, P M",La Clinica terapeutica,363,1

Ultrasound is considered the best tool to identify anatomic landmarks and the transection plane during liver surgery. The aim of this study was to analyse the outcomes of LLR performed with a standardized US guidance technique. METHODS We have standardized a 4-step technique for ultrasound-guided LLR: (1) compose a 3-D mind map by studying relationships among lesions and surrounding anatomic structures, (2) sketch the map on the liver surface, (3) check, and (4) correct the transection plane in real time. RESULTS Between 01/2006 and 12/2016, 190 consecutive patients treated with US-guided LLR were analysed. The indications for LLR included malignant tumours in 148 patients (81.8%). The procedures were classified according to a difficulty scale. There were 18 major hepatectomies (9.9%), 80 anatomic bi- and monosegmentectomies (44.2%), and 101 non-anatomic resections (55.8%). Redo resection was performed in 17 patients (9.4%), and multiple liver resections were performed in 25 patients (24.7%). Median intraoperative blood loss was 100 ± 154 mL. Overall and major morbidity rates were 14.9% and 1.6%, respectively. Mortality was nil.

A growing number of studies call attention to the relationship between VD deficiency and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of VD on subclinical left ventricular (LV) function in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with no significant coronary artery disease. Material and methods We recruited 140 patients (80 diabetics and 60 non-diabetics) with symptoms of stable ischemic heart disease who underwent coronary angiography and who had no significant coronary artery disease in our clinic. The 25(OH)D3 levels were measured and patients who had 25-(OH)D3 levels below 20 ng/dl were defined as the VD deficient group. In addition to conventional echocardiographic parameters, tissue Doppler echocardiography was used for LV diastolic functions and 2D speckle tracking strain echocardiography (2D STE) for evaluating the longitudinal deformation indices of the LV myocardium. Results In all groups, LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) was significantly impaired in patients with VD deficiency (p < 0.001) compared to patients without VD deficiency. LV global longitudinal strain rate (GLSR) was significantly impaired in patients with VD deficiency (p = 0.003). The GLS was negatively associated with 25-(OH)D3 in the VD deficiency group (r = -0.52623, p < 0.001). Conversely, GLS was positively associated with 25-(OH)D3 levels in the normal VD group (r = 0.28, p = 0.048). Conclusions VD deficiency is associated with impaired myocardial GLS. The present study demonstrated that VD deficiency may be the cause of subclinical myocardial dysfunction in patients with or without diabetes mellitus and no history of significant coronary artery disease.","Ozer, Pelin Karaca; Emet, Samim; Karaayvaz, Ekrem Bilal; Elitok, Ali; Bilge, Ahmet Kaya; Adalet, Kamil; Oncul, Aytac",Archives of medical sciences.

When Should It be Concerned?,16.621252,12.347812,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND Viruses are commonly detected in children with acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) and in asymptomatic children. Longitudinal studies of viral detections during asymptomatic periods surrounding ARI could facilitate interpretation of viral detections but are currently scant. METHODS We used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to analyze respiratory samples from young Andean children for viruses during asymptomatic periods within 8-120 days of index ARI (cough or fever). We compared viral detections over time within children and explored reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction cycle thresholds (CTs) as surrogates for viral loads. RESULTS At least 1 respiratory virus was detected in 367 (43%) of 859 samples collected during asymptomatic periods, with more frequent detections in periods with rhinorrhea (49%) than those without (34%, P < 0.001). Relative to index ARI with human rhinovirus (HRV), adenovirus (AdV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus detected, the same viruses were also detected during 32, 22, 10 and 3% of asymptomatic periods, respectively. RSV was only detected 8-30 days after index RSV ARI, whereas HRV and AdV were detected throughout asymptomatic periods. Human metapneumovirus and influenza were rarely detected during asymptomatic periods (<3%). No significant differences were observed in the CT for HRV or AdV during asymptomatic periods relative to ARI. For RSV, CTs were significantly lower during ARI relative to the asymptomatic period (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that influenza, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus and RSV detections in children with an ARI usually indicate a causal relationship. When HRV or AdV is detected during ARI, the causal relationship is less certain.","Howard, Leigh M; Johnson, Monika; Williams, John V; Zhu, Yuwei; Gil, Ana I; Edwards, Kathryn M; Griffin, Marie R; Lanata, Claudio F; Grijalva, Carlos G",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,363,29

To face the pandemic outbreak, hospitals converted wards to assure COVID-19 patients' care and adopted measures to reduce virus diffusion. The aim of this study was to determine how many physiotherapists, in the Lombardy region, worked during pandemic, whether they continued their usual practice or were employed in COVID-19 wards and in which tasks they were involved. The survey was submitted online by the national professional order. The response rate was 11.79%. During the pandemic, 648 (53.9%) respondents interrupted their services. Less than 20% of the physiotherapists that continued working were assigned to COVID-19 wards with the role of physiotherapist. Only a small proportion of respondents had advanced skills in respiratory physiotherapy. Moreover, this study showed a limited involvement of physiotherapists inside the very acute and intense settings. In conclusion, this work revealed that, during COVID-19 pandemic, in the Lombardy region a small percentage of physiotherapists was employed in COVID-19 wards, mainly in post-acute context. Even though the response rate of this survey was very low, this study highlights the need to define and underline the role of physiotherapy in acute setting during emergency.","Privitera, Emilia; D'Abrosca, Francesco; Gaudiello, Giuseppe; Lazzeri, Marta; Bellofiore, Angela; Frigerio, Pamela; Santambrogio, Martina",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,363,23

Carolinas Comfort Scale (CCS) is a hernia-specific questionnaire regarding health-related QoL after a mesh hernia repair. The primary objective of this study was to monitor changes in health-related QoL over time after different mesh hernia repair procedures using the CCS. METHODS We performed a prospective study with an exploratory, intraobserver design enrolling consecutive patients who were to undergo elective mesh hernia repair. Four different hernia repair techniques were included and analyzed specifically for each surgical group. Patients scored themselves using CCS preoperatively and at several fixed times postoperatively. Since no gold standard exists for either hernia-specific QoL questionnaires or change of scores on PROMs as a function of time after hernia repair, we compared the CCS scores with the visual analog scale (VAS) scores reflecting the subdomains of the CCS. RESULTS A total of 166 patients completed the study. CCS scores for QoL, pain, sensation of mesh, and activity limitations changed significantly with time during the 90-day study period. Furthermore, CCS and VAS showed significant agreement and correlation (ρ = 0.52-0.82, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The present study is the first to demonstrate significant changes over time in health-related QoL using the CCS after four different types of hernia repair with mesh.","Christoffersen, Mette W; Rosenberg, Jacob; Jorgensen, Lars Nannestad; Bytzer, Peter; Bisgaard, Thue",World journal of surgery,363,1

Underlying it is the recombination activating gene (RAG)-based V(D)J recombination system, which initiates the sequence diversification of the immunoglobulins and lymphocyte antigen receptors. It was convincingly argued that the RAG1 and RAG2 genes originated from a single transposon. The current dogma postulates that the V(D)J recombination system was established by the split of a primordial vertebrate immune receptor gene into V and J segments by a RAG1/2 transposon, in parallel with the domestication of the same transposable element in a separate genomic locus as the RAG recombinase. Here, based on a new interpretation of previously published data, we propose an alternative evolutionary hypothesis suggesting that two different elements, a RAG1/2 transposase and a Transib transposon invader with RSS-like terminal inverted repeats, co-evolved to work together, resulting in a functional recombination process. This hypothesis offers an alternative understanding of the acquisition of recombinase function by RAGs and the origin of the V(D)J system.","Yakovenko, Iryna; Agronin, Jacob; Smith, L Courtney; Oren, Matan",Frontiers in immunology,363,20

We analyzed flow modification in cases where a single Pipeline Embolization Device was deployed from the M1 to the distal supraclinoid ICA, covering the A1, for aneurysm treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS A1 flow modifications and size regression in postprocedure and follow-up angiography were analyzed. Vessel diameters and ratios of the proximal A1 and M1 segments and the distal ICA were assessed. Relationships between Pipeline Embolization Device nominal diameter and the vessel diameters at landing zones were obtained. Clinical assessments after flow modification were documented. RESULTS Six of 7 patients demonstrated no change of flow in the anterior cerebral artery/anterior communicating artery complex at immediate postembolization angiography. All patients who underwent follow-up angiography demonstrated size regression of the ipsilateral A1. Midterm follow-up angiography revealed complete reversal of flow in the ipsilateral A1 in 4 of 5 patients. One patient did not demonstrate flow modification. This patient had a dominant ipsilateral A1. Vessel ratios in this case demonstrated a unique configuration in favor of maintaining patency of the ipsilateral A1. There were no clinical or radiographic signs of ischemia. One patient experienced asymptomatic angiographic in-stent stenosis at the M1. CONCLUSIONS We found that deployment of a Pipeline Embolization Device from the distal supraclinoid ICA to the M1 may result in reversal of flow in the anterior cerebral artery/anterior communicating artery complex and regression of the ipsilateral A1.

Recently, desalination capacity significantly increased from approximately 35 million m3 daily (MCM/day) in 2005 to about 95 MCM/day in 2018. Seawater desalination accounts for about 61% of global desalination capacity, while brackish water desalination accounts for 30%. Membrane desalination, mainly using reverse osmosis (RO), accounts for ¾ of global desalination capacity, with the rest mostly used for thermal desalination using multi-stage flash distillation (MSF), and multi-effect distillation (MED). Despite the undeniable role of desalination for securing water supply in areas where natural freshwater supplies are scarce, desalination impacts the natural environment at different aspects. Environmental impacts (EIs) of the desalination process are different and vary significantly according to the nature of the utilized feedwater, the desalination technology in use, and the management of waste brine generated. In this work, the EIs of each desalination technology were thoroughly investigated, with careful consideration given to different feedwater qualities, and various brine management techniques. Although the different aspects of desalination EIs have been extensively studied in the literature, the literature lacks comprehensive reviews and summaries of all the associated EIs. This article compiles the different EIs associated with the whole desalination process in one-hub, applying an intake-to-outfall approach. The leading desalination technologies of RO, MSF, and MED were analyzed, along with different feedwaters. This article provides a mapping of the different technologies involving feedwater and brine management techniques and a detailed description of their impact on the environment. Finally, recommendations and conclusions were given to minimize the negative impacts of desalination on both the local and global environments.","Elsaid, Khaled; Kamil, Mohammed; Sayed, Enas Taha; Abdelkareem, Mohammad Ali; Wilberforce, Tabbi; Olabi, A",The Science of the total environment,363,25

Many such infections are known to be transmissible by blood transfusion, while others have properties indicating this potential. There has been no comprehensive review of such infectious agents and their threat to transfusion recipient safety to date. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The members of AABB's Transfusion Transmitted Diseases Committee reviewed a large number of information sources in order to identify infectious agents with actual or potential risk of transfusion transmission now or in the future in the US or Canada; with few exceptions, these agents do not have available interventions to reduce the risk of such transmission. Using a group discussion and writing process, key characteristics of each agent were identified, researched, recorded and documented in standardized format. A group process was used to prioritize each agent on the basis of scientific/epidemiologic data and a subjective assessment of public perception and/or concern expressed by regulatory agencies.

In this hospital-based cohort study, we analysed clinical profiles and outcomes of 1161 COVID-19 hospitalized patients (vaccinated with COVISHIELD (ChAdOx1) or COVAXIN (BBV-152), n = 495 and unvaccinated n = 666) in Hyderabad, India between April 24th and May 31st 2021. Viral genome sequencing revealed that >90% of patients in both groups were harbouring the Delta variant (Pango lineage B.1.617.2) of SARS-CoV-2. Vaccinated individuals showed higher neutralizing antibodies (545+-1256 AU/ml Vs 51.1+-296 AU/ml; p<0.001) and significantly decreased Ferritin (392.26+-448.4 ng/mL Vs 544.82+-641.41 ng/mL; p<0.001) and LDH (559.45+-324.05 U/L Vs 644.99+- 294.03 U/L; p<0.001), when compared to the unvaccinated group. Severity of the disease (3.2% Vs 7.2%; p=0.0039) and requirement of ventilatory support (2.8% Vs 5.9%; p=0.0154) were significantly low in the vaccinated group despite the fact that these individuals had significantly higher age and risk factors. The rate of mortality was about 50% lower (2/132=1.51%) in the completely vaccinated breakthrough infections although mortality in individuals who had received a single dose was similar to the unvaccinated group (9/269=3.35% vs 23/666= 3.45%).

Online learning also introduces other issues like higher stress level but still has a few of positive traits like spending less money to physically attend the classes. Many students argue that programming is the most difficult subject to learn in online environment. In response to the issues, some suggestions are provided for computing lecturers. © 2021 IEEE.","Wijanto, M.

The interferon molecules produced from infected cells act through autocrine and paracrine signaling to turn host cells into an antiviral state. Although the molecular mechanisms of IFN signaling have been well characterized, how the interferon response collectively contribute to the regulation of host cells to stop or suppress viral infection during early infection remain unclear. Here, we use mathematical models to delineate the roles of the autocrine and the paracrine signaling, and show that their impacts on viral spread are dependent on how infection proceeds. In particular, we found that when infection is well-mixed, the paracrine signaling is not as effective; in contrast, when infection spreads in a spatial manner, a likely scenario during initial infection in tissue, the paracrine signaling can impede the spread of infection by decreasing the number of susceptible cells close to the site of infection. Furthermore, we argue that the interferon response can be seen as a parallel to population-level epidemic prevention strategies such as contact tracing or ring vaccination. Thus, our results here may have implications for the outbreak control at the population scale more broadly.","Lavigne, G. M.; Russell, H.; Sherry, B.; Ke, R.",,363,1

Previous studies of this disease, especially for south-east Asia, have found very limited association between synoptic meteorological variables and the number of dengue hospitalisations. However, to tackle future severe outbreaks and to institute an early warning system, it will immensely beneficial to find and establish more clear association with rate of dengue hospitalisations and the most relevant meteorological variables. Objectives: A rigorous Bayesian modelling framework is provided to identify the most important meteorological covariates and their lagged effects for developing an early warning system for dengue outbreaks in the Central Region of Malaysia. Method: We obtain the dengue hospitalisations count data and the demographic information in the Central Region of Malaysia. Along with other mesoscale environmental measurements such as local temperature, precipitation and ozone concentration level, we also examine multiple synoptic scale Ni&ntildeo indices which are related to the phenomenon of El Ni&ntildeo Southern Oscillation and an unobserved meteorological variable derived from reanalysis data. A probabilistic early warning system is built based on a Bayesian spatio-temporal hierarchical model with a physically interpretable complex structure. Results: Our study finds a 46.87% of increase in dengue hospitalisations due to one degree increase in the sea surface temperature anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific region with a lag time of six weeks. We also discover the existence of a mild association between the rate of cases and a distant lagged cooling effect of 28 weeks related to a phenomenon called El Ni&ntildeo Modoki. The proposed model also observes significant amount of association with some other meteorological parameters with disease rates. These associations are assessed by using an optimal Bayesian spatio-temporal model that outperforms other candidate models in terms of estimated out-of-sample predictive accuracy and performance in correctly issuing the warnings early. Discussion: With the novel spatial dynamic early warning system presented, our results show that the synoptic meteorological drivers can enhance short-term detection of dengue outbreaks and these can also potentially be used to provide longer-term forecasts","Yip, S.; Che Him, N.; Jamil, N.

In this study we employ a new approach to elucidate the composition of the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) of a prototypical arbovirus called Sindbis (SINV). SINV RNPs contain 453 cellular and 6 viral proteins, many of these proteins are nuclear in uninfected cells and redistribute to the cytoplasm upon infection. These findings suggest that SINV RNAs act as ’spiderwebs’, capturing host factors required for viral replication and gene expression in the cytoplasm. Functional perturbation of several of these host proteins causes profound effects in virus infection, as illustrated here with the tRNA ligase complex. Moreover, inhibition of viral RNP components with available drugs hampers the infection of a wide range of viruses, opening new avenues for the development of broad-spectrum therapies. Research highlights SINV RNA interactome includes 453 cellular and 6 viral proteins.

While healthcare workers (HCWs) have been at the frontlines for the pandemic response, vaccine acceptance amongst them needs further study. Methods A web-based survey to assess vaccine acceptance and preparedness in India was disseminated to HCWs working in various settings between January and February 2021, shortly after the launch of Indias vaccination campaign. Descriptive statistics were used to examine respondent demographics and Likert scale responses. Binomial logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with vaccine acceptance. Results The survey yielded 624 respondents from 25 states and five union territories in India; 53.5% were male, and median age was 37 years (IQR 32-46). Amongst all respondents, 84.1% (525/624) supported COVID-19 vaccines, and 63.2% (141/223) of those unvaccinated at the time of survey administration were willing to accept a vaccine. Reliability on government sources, healthcare providers or scientific journal articles for COVID-19 related information was reported by 66.8%, while confidence in social media for this information was reported by only 4.5%. Factors independently associated with vaccine acceptance included advancing age (aOR 3.50 [95% CI, 1.04-11.76] for those above 45 years), evidence of vaccine effectiveness and safety (aOR 3.78 [95% CI 1.15-12.38]), and provision of free/no-cost vaccine (aOR 2.63 [95% CI, 1.06-6.50]). Most respondents (80%) were confident about their hospital being equipped to efficiently rollout COVID-19 vaccines to the general population. Conclusions Overall attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination and preparedness were positive among HCWs in India, although acceptance was lower among healthier and younger HCWs. Data availability on vaccine safety and effectiveness, and cost considerations were important for acceptance. Targeted interventions are needed to improve vaccine acceptance amongst HCWs, since they are critical in promoting vaccine acceptance amongst the general population.","Mehta, K.; Dhaliwal, B.; Zodpey, S.; Loisate, S.; Banerjee, P.; GUPTA, M.; Shet, A.",,363,31

METHODS Dog sputum models were established by administering dimethoate emulsifiable. Twenty-seven intubated dogs were equally randomized into three groups of conventional suctioning (CS) group, VSSS with no supplemental oxygen (VSSS) group and VSSS with 100% oxygen (VSSS/O2) group. The suctioning efficiency, vital signs and tracheal wall injury were assessed. RESULTS The VSSS/O2 (8.6 ± 0.7g) and VSSS groups (8.5 ± 0.9 g) collected significantly more sputum than the CS group (5.9 ± 0.8 g) (P < 0.05 for VSSS/O2 group versus CS group; P < 0.05 for VSSS group versus CS group). Immediately after suctioning, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2 ) of VSSS/O2 group was significantly higher than that of the VSSS group or the CS group (both P < 0.05), and 5 min after suction the PaO2 , the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) in all groups returned to the baseline (p = 0.54, P = 0.67, P = 0.11, respectively). Moreover, in the VSSS/O2 and VSSS groups all the three variables were higher than the CS group at 5 min after suctioning (P < 0.01, P = 0.03; P = 0.02, P < 0.01; P = 0.02, P = 0.01 respectively).

Another possible route of viral transmission is entry through aerosolized droplets into the tears, which then pass through the nasolacrimal ducts and into the respiratory tract. For nonemergent care, eye care providers should use telehealth. Eye care providers should prioritize patient care in order of absolute necessity, such as sudden vision loss, sudden onset flashes and floaters, and eye trauma. In those cases, exposure should be minimized. The close proximity between eye care providers and their patients during slit-lamp examination may require further precautions, such as shields, barriers, and mask use to lower the risk of transmission via droplets or through hand to eye contact.

The reactivity of three BECV isolates (strain G110, F15 and NCDCV) with the different monoclonal antibodies was studied by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), ELISA, hemagglutination-inhibition and seroneutralization. G110 and F15 interacted in a similar manner with the monoclonal antibodies, but NCDCV failed to react with A9 monoclonal antibody. IIF test allowed us to detect another difference between U.K. BECV isolate and other BECV, in that the U.K. isolate did not react with F7 monoclonal antibody. No differences could be seen by IIF in the reactivity of Danish BECV isolate, Human Enteric Coronavirus (HECV), Bovine Respiratory Coronavirus (BRCV) and our BECV strains, with the 12 monoclonal antibodies.

This article paints a more complex picture by distinguishing between a first and second phase of the pandemic. The initial spread of infections and its correlation with socio-economic factors depends on how the virus first entered a country. The second phase of the pandemic begins when individuals start taking precautionary measures and governments implement lockdowns. In this phase the spread of the virus depends on the ability of individuals to socially distance themselves, which is to some extent socially stratified. METHODS: We analyse the geographical distribution of known cumulative cases and fatalities per capita in an ecological analysis across local districts in Germany distinguishing between the first and the second phase of the pandemic. RESULTS: In Germany, the virus first entered via individuals returning from skiing in the Alps and other international travel. In this first phase we find a positive association between the wealth of a district and infection rates and a negative association with indicators of social deprivation. During the second phase and controlling for path dependency, districts with a higher share of university-educated employees record fewer new infections and deaths and richer districts record fewer deaths, districts with a higher unemployment rate record more deaths.

The AUC values of textural features and clinical features were 0.93 (0.86-1.00) and 0.95 (0.95-0.99), respectively. (4) The Spearman correlation analysis showed that most textural and clinical features had above-moderate correlations with disease severity (> 0.4). CONCLUSION: Texture analysis can provide reliable and objective information for differential diagnosis of COVID-19. KEY POINTS: â¢ CT texture analysis can well differentiate common and severe COVID-19 patients. â¢ Some textural features showed above-moderate correlations with clinical factors. â¢ CT texture analysis can provide useful information to judge the severity of COVID-19.","Wei, Wei; Hu, Xiao-Wen; Cheng, Qi; Zhao, Ying-Ming; Ge, Ya-Qiong",Eur Radiol,363,16

The present prebirth cohort study examined the relationship between BAIAP2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs8079781 and the risk of behavioral problems in Japanese children aged 5 years. Subjects were 1175 mother-child pairs. Emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity problems, peer problems, and low prosocial behavior were assessed using the parent version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Compared with the CC genotype of SNP rs8079781, at least one T allele was significantly inversely related to childhood emotional problems: the adjusted OR was 0.68 (95% CI 0.46-0.998, P = 0.049). Nevertheless, this significant inverse association disappeared after adjustment for multiple comparisons (adjusted P = 0.245). No associations were observed between SNP rs8079781 and childhood conduct problems, hyperactivity problems, peer problems, or low prosocial behavior. An independent positive relationship was observed between smoking in the household during the first year of life and emotional problems in children with the CC genotype, but not in those with at least one T allele (P for interaction = 0.04). This study is the first to show that at least one T allele of SNP rs8079781 was independently associated with a reduced risk of emotional problems in children aged 5 years, but this inverse association fell below significance after adjustment for multiple comparisons. The influence of smoking in the household during the first year of life might rely on rs8079781.","Miyake, Yoshihiro; Tanaka, Keiko; Arakawa, Masashi",,363,26

In this rapid review, we examine community-engaged responses that move beyond risk communication and instead meaningfully integrate communities into decision-making and multi-sectoral action on various dimensions of the response to COVID-19. Based on a rapid, global review of 42 case studies of diverse forms of substantive community engagement in response to COVID-19, this paper identifies promising models of effective community-engaged responses and highlights the factors enabling or disabling these responses. The paper reflects on the ways in which these community-engaged responses contribute to comprehensive approaches and address social determinants and rights, within dynamics of relational power and inequality, and how they are sometimes able to take advantage of the ruptures and uncertainties of a new pandemic to refashion some of these dynamics.","Loewenson, Rene; Colvin, Christopher J; Szabzon, Felipe; Das, Sayan; Khanna, Renu; Coelho, Vera Schattan P; Gansane, Zakaria; Yao, Soungalo; Asibu, Wilson D; Rome, Nyles; Nolan, Elizabeth",Glob Public Health,363,6

We investigated whether transcranial Doppler ultrasound has utility for identifying microemboli and clinically relevant cerebral blood flow velocities (CBFVs) in COVID-19. METHODS: We performed transcranial Doppler for a consecutive series of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection admitted to 2 intensive care units at a large academic center including evaluation for microembolic signals. Variables specific to hypercoagulability and blood flow including transthoracic echocardiography were analyzed as a part of routine care. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were included in this analysis, 16 with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Of those, 2 had acute ischemic stroke secondary to large vessel occlusion. Ten non-COVID stroke patients were included for comparison. Two COVID-negative patients had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and stroke due to large vessel occlusion. In patients with COVID-19, relatively low CBFVs were observed diffusely at median hospital day 4 (interquartile range, 3-9) despite low hematocrit (29.5% [25.7%-31.6%]); CBFVs in comparable COVID-negative stroke patients were significantly higher compared with COVID-positive stroke patients. Microembolic signals were not detected in any patient. Median left ventricular ejection fraction was 60% (interquartile range, 60%-65%). CBFVs were correlated with arterial oxygen content, and C-reactive protein (Spearman &#961;=0.28 [P=0.04]; 0.58 [P<0.001], respectively) but not with left ventricular ejection fraction (&#961;=-0.18; P=0.42). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection, we observed lower than expected CBFVs in setting of low arterial oxygen content and low hematocrit but not associated with suppression of cardiac output.","Ziai, Wendy C; Cho, Sung-Min; Johansen, Michelle C; Ergin, Bahattin; Bahouth, Mona N",Stroke,363,16

Here, we de novo defined full-length macaque gene models based on single molecule, long-read transcriptome sequencing in four macaque tissues (frontal cortex, cerebellum, heart and testis). Overall, 8 588 227 poly(A)-bearing complementary DNA reads with a mean length of 14 106 nt were generated to compile the backbone of macaque transcripts, with the fine-scale structures further refined by RNA sequencing and cap analysis gene expression sequencing data. In total, 51 605 macaque gene models were accurately defined, covering 89.7% of macaque or 75.7% of human orthologous genes. Based on the full-length gene models, we performed a human-macaque comparative analysis on polyadenylation (PA) regulation. Using macaque and mouse as outgroup species, we identified 79 distal PA events newly originated in humans and found that the strengthening of the distal PA sites, rather than the weakening of the proximal sites, predominantly contributes to the origination of these human-specific isoforms. Notably, these isoforms are selectively constrained in general and contribute to the temporospatially specific reduction of gene expression, through the tinkering of previously existed mechanisms of nuclear retention and microRNA (miRNA) regulation. Overall, the protocol and resource highlight the application of bioinformatics in integrating multilayer genomics data to provide an intact reference for model animal studies, and the isoform switching detected may constitute a hitherto underestimated regulatory layer in shaping the human-specific transcriptome and phenotypic changes.","Li, Yumei; Shen, Qing Sunny; Peng, Qi; Ding, Wanqiu; Zhang, Jie; Zhong, Xiaoming; An, Ni A; Ji, Mingjun; Zhou, Wei-Zhen; Li, Chuan-Yun",Brief. bioinform,363,10

The temperature dependence of the crystal structures of two quinacridone polymorphs (ß and Î³), along with the common variant 2,9-dimethylquinacridone, were investigated using powder X-ray diffraction and terahertz spectroscopy. These were then compared with solid-state density functional theory simulations of both structures and vibrations. X-ray patterns were collected at eight temperatures in the range 13-298 K and terahertz spectra at fifteen temperatures in the range 20-300 K. Simulations were at absolute zero and at appropriate expansions to model room temperature. It was found that some of the powder X-ray diffraction features in only ß-quinacridone (15.7°, 19.7° and 31.2° at 13 K) underwent anomalous shifting with temperature change. We attribute this to the unique coplanar hydrogen bonding pattern of ß-quinacridone compared to the other solids, with the unusual diffraction peaks originating from crystallographic planes perpendicular to the a axis intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This observation coincides with a contraction of the a axis with heating and results from its relatively weak N-HO hydrogen bonds and significant C-HH-C repulsions. Associated with this anomalous contraction, for ß-quinacridone only spectral peaks are seen to increase in energy with temperature.","Squires, A D; Zaczek, Adam J; Lewis, R A; Korter, Timothy M",,363,6

This is the result of economic, demographic, and technological changes, among others. In recent decades Israel has started implementing reforms in the public health services that have led to far-reaching changes in the health system, and consequently, increased competition within it. The impact of these changes has been exacerbated by pressure to reduce per capita public health costs, coupled with increased demand and greater health awareness. All these changes have created a turbulent environment for healthcare organizations in Israel. To cope with this dynamic environment, various parts of the system have had to adopt appropriate management behaviors and business styles. This study, carried out in six public hospitals in Israel, evaluates the nature and degree of adaptation, implementation, and inculcation of management strategies in public hospitals in Israel, using the Ginter model of strategic management of health organizations. METHODS: The study used semi-structured in-depth interviews of key figures in the health system and managers at various levels in the hospitals and HMOs included in the sample. The 55 interviews, conducted in two time periods, were analyzed in accordance with an established theory of qualitative methodological analysis. RESULTS: The main findings are that the health market and hospitals in Israel are increasingly adopting competitive business behaviors. But strategic managerial behavior has been adopted only in part, and there is a lack of collaboration between staff and management in defining goals and strategic activity. These are obstacles to change and inculcation of the strategy in hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: This study affords an important view over time and a better understanding of the behavior and adaptation of hospitals in Israel to their constantly changing surroundings. Adapting and inculcating appropriate managerial strategies in hospitals requires close collaboration between staff and management; its absence is an obstacle that contributes to partial, and possibly counter-productive, strategic behavior. The solution may lie in a combination of changes: providing hospital management with the necessary tools and broad professional support by the Ministry of Health; organizational changes in hospital management and departments; the creation of a clinical leadership role; and a self-supervised planning system . POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS: These recommendations regarding training and the direction and organization of the change, coupled with systemic oversight of them by the Ministry of Health, will enable the system to become more efficient. They are particularly relevant today because the Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated and highlighted Israeli public hospitals' financial and organizational problems. Hospitals that already faced many challenges have had to cope with an unfamiliar medical crisis and a reduction of elective medical activity, causing them various types of damage, especially in term of economic stability. The hospitals' fragile situation must become a top government priority because it can no longer be ignored. To achieve a strong healthcare system with stable hospitals, able to respond both to everyday challenges and to crises like the current pandemic, policymakers must provide financial and organizational support alongside managerial training, while maintaining an overall systemic plan.","Naamati Schneider, Lior",Isr J Health Policy Res,363,20

This brief report draws on a service evaluation undertaken immediately prior to and during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic creates a paradox when considering safety in the home, but it is important to recognise the dangers this presents to many victims of stalking. The information presented in this report is based on existing literature and early evidence from semi-structured interviews and discussions with 15 victims and six practitioners. Whilst lockdown measures might appear to be a time when victims are less accessible to their stalkers, early evidence from this study suggests that their vulnerability is increased. Technology has helped to facilitate stalking behaviours by providing stalkers with new approaches to control, humiliate, threaten and isolate their victims. Some lockdown restrictions have provided increased opportunities for stalkers to monitor their victims and the professional uncertainty and recognition around stalking has continued, coupled with delays in the criminal justice system. The COVID-19 crisis has reversed gains made by stalking victims and has imprisoned some victims in their homes making their whereabouts easier to monitor. Stalking behaviour has not ceased as a result of the COVID-19 restrictions and the risk of harm to victims remains significant. Effective practice, policy and legal responses are required for both the victims and perpetrators of stalking during the pandemic and afterwards.","Bracewell, Kelly; Hargreaves, Paul; Stanley, Nicky",J Fam Violence,363,1

We conducted a systematic scoping review to identify network-building interventions that address loneliness and isolation, describe their components and impact on network structure, and consider their application in the wake of COVID19. METHODS: We performed forward and backward citation tracking of three seminal publications on network interventions and Bibliographic search of Web of Science and SCOPUS. We developed data charting tables and extracted and synthesized the characteristics of included studies, using an iteratively updating form. FINDINGS: From 3390 retrieved titles and abstracts, we included 8 studies. These interventions focused on building networks at either individual- or group-levels. Key elements that were incorporated in the interventions at varying degrees included (a) creating opportunities to build networks; (b) improving social skills; (c) assessing network diagnostics (i.e. using network data or information to inform network strategies); (d) promoting engagement with influential actors; and (e) a process for goal-setting and feedback. The effect of interventions on network structures, or the moderating effect of structure on the intervention effectiveness was rarely assessed. CONCLUSIONS: As many natural face-to-face opportunities for social connection are limited due to COVID19, groups already at risk for social isolation and loneliness are disproportionately impacted. Network-building interventions include multiple components that address both the structure of individuals' networks, and their skills and motivation for activating them. These intervention elements could be adapted for delivery via online platforms, and implemented by trained facilitators or novice volunteers, although more rigorous testing is needed.","Yousefi Nooraie, Reza; Warren, Keith; Juckett, Lisa A; Cao, Qiuchang A; Bunger, Alicia C; Patak-Pietrafesa, Michele A",PLoS One,363,1

Therefore, anticipation of potential novel SARS-causing species or SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced binding to ACE2 is key in the prevention of future threats to come. We have characterized a de novo single substitution, Q498Y, in SARS-CoV-2 RBD that confers stronger adherence to ACE2. While the SARS-CoV-2 {beta} variant, which includes three simultaneous amino acid replacements, induces a 4-fold stronger affinity, a single Q498Y substitution results in 2.5-fold tighter binding, compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 2019 strain.

Our aim was to determine whether the administration of adipose-tissue derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AT-MSC) is safe and potentially useful in these patients. Methods: Thirteen COVID-19 adult patients under invasive mechanical ventilation who had received previous antiviral and/or anti-inflammatory treatments (including steroids, lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine and/or tocilizumab, among others) were treated with allogeneic AT-MSC. Ten patients received two doses, with the second dose administered a median of 3 days (interquartile range-IQR- 1 day) after the first one. Two patients received a single dose and another patient received 3 doses. Median number of cells per dose was 0.98 × 106 (IQR 0.50 × 106) AT-MSC/kg of recipient's body weight. Potential adverse effects related to cell infusion and clinical outcome were assessed. Additional parameters analyzed included changes in imaging, analytical and inflammatory parameters. Findings: First dose of AT-MSC was administered at a median of 7 days (IQR 12 days) after mechanical ventilation. No adverse events were related to cell therapy. With a median follow-up of 16 days (IQR 9 days) after the first dose, clinical improvement was observed in nine patients (70%). Seven patients were extubated and discharged from ICU while four patients remained intubated (two with an improvement in their ventilatory and radiological parameters and two in stable condition). Two patients died (one due to massive gastrointestinal bleeding unrelated to MSC therapy). Treatment with AT-MSC was followed by a decrease in inflammatory parameters (reduction in C-reactive protein, IL-6, ferritin, LDH and d-dimer) as well as an increase in lymphocytes, particularly in those patients with clinical improvement. Interpretation: Treatment with intravenous administration of AT-MSC in 13 severe COVID-19 pneumonia under mechanical ventilation in a small case series did not induce significant adverse events and was followed by clinical and biological improvement in most subjects.

METHODS: In this single-center retrospective cohort study, characteristics of patients infected with four different SARS-CoV-2 variants were documented from medical files. The outcome was the occurrence of clinical failure, defined as hospitalization (for outpatients), transfer to the intensive-care unit (inpatients), and death (all). RESULTS: 254 patients were infected with clade 20A (20AS), 85 with Marseille-1 (M1V), 190 with Marseille-4 (M4V) and 211 with N501Y (N501YV) variants. 20AS presented a bell-shaped epidemiological curve and nearly disappeared around May 2020. M1V reached a very weak peak, then disappeared after a month-and-a-half. M4V appeared in July presented an atypical wave form during seven months. N501YV has only recently appeared. As compared to 20AS, patients infected with M1V were less likely to report dyspnoea (aOR=0.50, p=0.04), rhinitis (aOR=0.57, p=0.04) and to be hospitalised (aOR=0.22, p=0.002). Patients infected with M4V were more likely to report fever than those with 20AS and M1V (aOR=2.49, p<0.0001 and aOR=2.30, p=0.007, respectively) and to be hospitalised than those with M1V (aOR=4.81, p=0.003). Patients infected with N501YV reported lower rate of rhinitis (aOR=0.50, p=0.001) and anosmia (aOR=0.57, p=0.02), as compared to those infected with 20AS. A lower rate of hospitalisation associated with N501YV infection as compared to 20AS and M4V (aOR=0.33, p<0.0001 and aOR=0.27, p<0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The four lineages have presentations which differ from one other, epidemiologically and clinically. This supports SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance through next-generation sequencing.","Dao, Thi Loi; Hoang, Van Thuan; Nguyen, Nhu Ngoc; Delerce, Jérémy; Chaudet, Hervé; Levasseur, Anthony; Lagier, Jean Christophe; Raoult, Didier; Colson, Philippe; Gautret, Philippe",Clin. microbiol. infect,363,27

For cellular fusion, its antigenic peptides are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in humans. Therefore, exploration into residual interaction details of CoV2 with MHCs shall be a promising point for instigating the vaccine development. Envelope (E) protein, the smallest outer surface protein from SARS-CoV2 genome was found to possess the highest antigenicity and is therefore used to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes. Four novel mutations (T55S, V56F, E69R and G70del) were observed in E-protein of SARS-CoV2 after evolutionary analysis. It showed a coilâhelix transition in the protein conformation. Antigenic variability of the epitopes was also checked to explore the novel mutations in the epitope region. It was found that the interactions were more when SARS-CoV2 E-protein interacted with MHC-I than with MHC-II through several ionic and H-bonds. Tyr42 and Tyr57 played a predominant role upon interaction with MHC-I. The higher &#916;G values with lesser dissociation constant values also affirm the stronger and spontaneous interaction by SARS-CoV2 proteins with MHCs. On comparison with the consensus E-protein, SARS-CoV2 E-protein showed stronger interaction with the MHCs with lesser solvent accessibility. E-protein can therefore be targeted as a potential vaccine target against SARS-CoV2.","Bhattacharya, Shreya; Banerjee, Arundhati; Ray, Sujay",Int J Biol Macromol,363,6

Distinguished from two resistance states in conventional giant magnetoresistance, the magnetoresistance in the MnPS3/Fe3GeTe2 heterostructure exhibits three states, of high, intermediate, and low resistance. This antisymmetric magnetoresistance spike is determined by an unsynchronized magnetic switching between the AFM/FM interface layer and the bulk of Fe3GeTe2 during magnetization reversal. Our work highlights that the artificial vdW stacking structure holds potential to explore some physical phenomena and spintronic device applications.","Hu, Guojing; Zhu, Yuanmin; Xiang, Junxiang; Yang, Tzu-Yi; Huang, Meng; Wang, Zhe; Wang, Zhi; Liu, Ping; Zhang, Ying; Feng, Chao; Hou, Dazhi; Zhu, Wenguang; Gu, Meng; Hsu, Chia-Hsiu; Chuang, Feng-Chuan; Lu, Yalin; Xiang, Bin; Chueh, Yu-Lun",ACS nano,363,16

METHODS: We retrospectively matched (1:2) critical COVID-19 patients with one or more MDR GNB from any clinical specimen (cases), with those with no MDR GNB isolates (controls). RESULTS: Seventy-eight cases were identified (4.5 per 1,000 ICU days, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.6-5.7). Out of 98 MDR GNB isolates, the most frequent species were Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (24, 24.5%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (23, 23.5%). Two (8.7%) K. pneumoniae, and six (85.7%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were carbapenem resistant. A total of 24 (24.5%) isolates were not considered to be associated with active infection. Those with active infection received appropriate antimicrobial agent within a median of one day. The case group had significantly longer median central venous line days, mechanical ventilation days, and hospital length of stay (P<0.001 for each). All-cause mortality at 28 days was not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.19). Mechanical ventilation days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.062, 95% CI 1.012 to 1.114; P 0.015), but not receipt of corticosteroids or tocilizumab, was independently associated with the isolation of MDR GNB. There was no association between MDR GNB and 28-day all-cause mortality (aOR 2.426, 95% CI 0.833 to 7.069; P = 0.104). CONCLUSION: In critically ill COVID-19 patients, prevention of MDR GNB colonization and infections requires minimising the use of invasive devices, and to remove them as soon as their presence is no longer necessary.","Baiou, Anas; Elbuzidi, Abdurrahman A; Bakdach, Dana; Zaqout, Ahmed; Alarbi, Khalid M; Bintaher, Awadh A; Ali, Maisa M B; Elarabi, Anam M; Ali, Gawahir A M; Daghfal, Joanne; Almaslamani, Muna A; Ibrahim, Abdul Salam S; Alkhal, Abdullatif; Omrani, Ali S",J. hosp. infect,363,16

A comparative study through statistical analysis is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the various SAT systems build using various combinations of SM and SC soil types along with bioadsorbents such as eucalyptus leaves, sawdust and Mosambi peel. Further, the mass balance analysis of heavy metals is carried out to comprehend the course of expulsion. The study, through a statistical approach, endorses that the SAT in conjunction with adsorbent gives much better removal efficiency than the SAT without adsorbent. Additional removal efficiency of 14% to 30% can be achieved with introduction of adsorbents within the SAT system.

One thousand and eighty-two participants from Spain, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador took part in this study. Irrespective of the country, and controlling for income level, young people, especially females, suffered a greater level of stress, perceived the situation as more severe, showed less adherence to health guidelines, and reported lower levels of health consciousness, in comparison to their male peers and older groups. However, in the case of self-care, it seems that older and female groups are generally more involved in self-care activities and adopt more healthy daily routines. These results are mostly similar between Colombia, Ecuador, and Spain. However, Chile showed some different tendencies, as males reported higher levels of healthy daily routines and better adherence to health guidelines compared to females and people over the age of 60. Differences between countries, genders, and age ranges should be considered in order to improve health recommendations and adherence to guidelines. Moreover, developing community action and intersectoral strategies with a gender-based approach could help to reduce health inequalities and increase the success of people's adherence to health guidelines and self-care-promoting interventions. Future studies should be addressed to explore the possible causations of such differences in more cultural-distant samples and at later stages of the current outbreak.","Bermejo-Martins, Elena; Luis, Elkin O; Sarrionandia, Ainize; Martínez, Martín; Garcés, María Sol; Oliveros, Edwin Y; Cortés-Rivera, Cristian; Belintxon, Maider; Fernández-Berrocal, Pablo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),363,10

Materials/Methods: Between April 2020 and July 2020, patients without influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms at four radiation oncology departments (2 academic university hospitals and 2 community hospitals) underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 prior to the initiation of treatment. Patients were tested either prior to radiotherapy simulation or after simulation but prior to treatment initiation. Patients tested for indications of ILI symptoms were excluded from this analysis. Management of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients was individualized based on disease site and acuity. Results: Over a three-month period, a total of 385 tests were performed in 336 asymptomatic patients either prior to simulation (n=75), post-simulation, prior to treatment (n=230), or on-treatment (n=49). A total of 5 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, for a pre-treatment prevalence of 1.3% (2.6% in North/Central NJ and 0.4% in Southern NJ/Southeast PA). The median age of positive patients was 58 years (range: 38-78 years). All positive patients were white and were relatively equally distributed with regard to gender (2 male, 3 female) and ethnicity (2 Hispanic and 3 non-Hispanic). The median Charlson comorbidity score among positive patients was 5. All 5 patients were treated for different primary tumor sites, the large majority had advanced disease (80%), and all were treated for curative intent. The majority of positive patients were being treated with either sequential or concurrent immunosuppressive systemic therapy (80%). Initiation of treatment was delayed for 14 days with the addition of re-testing for 4 patients, while one patient was treated without delay but with additional infectious-disease precautions. Conclusion: Broad-based pre-treatment asymptomatic testing of radiation oncology patients for SARS-CoV-2 is of limited value, even in a high-incidence region. Future strategies may include focused risk-stratified asymptomatic testing.","Modi, C; Dragun, A E; Henson, C F; Jain, S; Ahlawat, S; Eastwick, G; Kubicek, G J; Mezera, M; Mulvihill, D J; Perri, J; Juneja, B; Khullar, K; Ennis, R D; Haffty, B G",Adv Radiat Oncol,363,24

COVID-19-related closed- and open-ended questions were included. A mixed-methods approach assessed COVID-19-related changes in well-being and sexual health by outness with an accepting guardian. RESULTS: The majority (57%) of participants reported being worried about COVID-19. Almost all (91%) were physically distancing. Participants noted that COVID-19 changed school, home, work, and family life. Participants highlighted that COVID-19 reduced their ability to socialize and had a deleterious effect on their mental health. In the past 3 months, participants reported seeing sexual partners in person less often, masturbating and viewing pornography more often, and sexting and messaging on men-seeking-men websites/phone applications about the same amount. Many described being physically distanced from sexual partners, and some noted an increase in their use of virtual ways to connect with partners (e.g., video chatting). There were no differences by outness with an accepting guardian in quantitative or qualitative responses.

Healthcare professionals are exposed to a particularly high risk of contracting the virus while providing resuscitation and respiratory support, which may in turn result in grave consequences and even death. Although COVID-19 has been shown to cause milder disease in children, paediatricians and intensivists who provide care for children must be prepared to provide optimal respiratory support without putting themselves or other medical, nursing, and paramedical staff at undue risk. We propose an airway management approach that is especially relevant in the current COVID-19 pandemic and provides instructions for: (1) Elective intubation for respiratory failure; and (2) Emergency intubation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. To minimise risk, intubation methods must be kept as straightforward as possible and should include the provision of appropriate personal protection and equipment to healthcare workers. We identify two key considerations: that bag-mask ventilation should be avoided if possible and that bacterial and viral filters should be placed in the respiratory circuit. Our novel approach provides a framework for airway management that could benefit paediatric critical care practitioners who provide care for any children with a novel viral illness, with a focus on infection prevention during high-risk airway management procedures.","Leung, K K Y; Ku, S W; Fung, R C M; Hui, W F; Au, C C; Cheung, W L; Szeto, W H; Wong, J C P; Kwan, K F; Hon, K L",Hong Kong med. j,363,16

We also show that intuitively reasonable contact tracing performance indicators, such as the proportion of contacts quarantined before symptom onset, are often not well correlated with the reproduction number.

This study empirically integrates ?technology readiness? and ?technology acceptance? models (TRAM) to predict subjective wellbeing among MAWF users. It also critically assesses the strength of the mediating effects on the link between technology readiness and subjective wellbeing. Data analysis of 694 actual users of MAWF by means of SEM-PLS approach proves the robust power of the TRAM model in predicting subjective wellbeing. In addition to their mediating effects, technology acceptance constructs tend to be more influenced by positive dimensions (i.e., optimism and innovativeness) than that of negative dimensions (i.e., insecurity and discomfort) of technology readiness. This study is one of the first attempts to predict subjective wellbeing among actual users of MAWF.

However, sequencing is necessary for mutation monitoring and tracking of clusters of transmission, development of diagnostics and for vaccines and drug development. Many sequencing methods are fast evolving to reduce test turn-around-time and to increase through-put compared to Sanger sequencing method; however, Sanger sequencing remains the gold standard for clinical research sequencing with its 99.99% accuracy This study sought to generate sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 using Sanger sequencing method and to characterize them for possible site(s) of mutations. About 30 pairs of primers were designed, synthesized, and optimized using endpoint PCR to generate amplicons for the full length of the virus. Cycle sequencing using BigDye Terminator v.3.1 and capillary gel electrophoresis on ABI 3130xl genetic analyser were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. The sequence data generated were assembled and analysed for variations using DNASTAR Lasergene 17 SeqMan Ultra. Total length of 29,760bp of SARS-CoV-2 was assembled from the sample analysed and deposited in GenBank with accession number: MT576584. Blast result of the sequence assembly shows a 99.97% identity with the reference sequence. Variations were noticed at positions: nt201, nt2997, nt14368, nt16535, nt20334, and nt28841-28843, which caused amino acid alterations at the S (aa614) and N (aa203-204) regions. The mutations observed at S and N-gene in this study may be indicative of a gradual changes in the genetic coding of the virus hence, the need for active surveillance of the viral genome.","Shaibu, Joseph Ojonugwa; Onwuamah, Chika K; James, Ayorinde Babatunde; Okwuraiwe, Azuka Patrick; Amoo, Olufemi Samuel; Salu, Olumuyiwa B; Ige, Fehintola A; Liboro, Gideon; Odewale, Ebenezer; Okoli, Leona Chika; Ahmed, Rahaman A; Achanya, Dominic; Adesesan, Adesegun; Amuda, Oyewunmi Abosede; Sokei, Judith; Oyefolu, Bola A O; Salako, Babatunde Lawal; Omilabu, Sunday Aremu; Audu, Rosemary Ajuma",PLoS One,363,24

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the setup, design, facilities, and strategic priorities of leading United Kingdom and United States health care innovation centers to identify transferable lessons for accelerating their creation and maximizing their impact. METHODS: We conducted qualitative case studies consisting of semistructured, audio-recorded interviews with decision makers and center staff in 6 innovation centers. We also conducted nonparticipant observations of meetings and center tours, where we took field notes. Qualitative data were analyzed initially within and then across cases facilitated by QSR International's NVivo software. RESULTS: The centers had different institutional arrangements, including university-associated institutes or innovation laboratories, business accelerators or incubators, and academic health science partnership models. We conducted interviews with 34 individuals, 1 group interview with 3 participants, and observations of 4 meetings. Although the centers differed significantly in relation to their mission, structure, and governance, we observed key common characteristics. These included high-level leadership support and incentives to engage in innovation activities, a clear mission to address identified gaps within their respective organizational and health system settings, physical spaces that facilitated networking through open-door policies, flat managerial structures characterized by new organizational roles for which boundary spanning was key, and a wider innovation ecosystem that was strategically and proactively engaged with the center facilitating external partnerships. CONCLUSIONS: Although innovation in health care settings is unpredictable, we offer insights that may help those establishing innovation centers. The key in this respect is the ability to support different kinds of innovations at different stages through adequate support structures, including the development of new career pathways.","Cresswell, Kathrin; Williams, Robin; Carlile, Narath; Sheikh, Aziz",J Med Internet Res,363,6

However, although there is considerable heterogeneity in the comorbidity profiles of these populations, not much is known about how prior comorbidities co-occur to form COVID-19 patient subgroups, and their implications for targeted care. Here we used bipartite networks to quantitatively and visually analyze heterogeneity in the comorbidity profiles of COVID-19 inpatients, based on electronic health records from 12 hospitals and 60 clinics in the greater Minneapolis region. This approach enabled the analysis and interpretation of heterogeneity at three levels of granularity (cohort, subgroup, and patient), each of which enabled clinicians to rapidly translate the results into the design of clinical interventions. We discuss future extensions of the multigranular heterogeneity framework, and conclude by exploring how the framework could be used to analyze other biomedical phenomena including symptom clusters and molecular phenotypes, with the goal of accelerating translation to targeted clinical care.","Bhavnani, S.

We hypothesised that differences in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes might influence this variation. Using next generation sequencing, we analysed the class I and class II classical HLA genes of 147 individuals of European descent experiencing variable clinical outcomes following COVID-19 infection. Forty-nine of these patients were admitted to hospital with severe respiratory disease. They had no significant pre-existing comorbidities. We compared the results to those obtained from a group of 69 asymptomatic hospital workers who evidence of COVID exposure based on blood antibody testing. Allele frequencies in both the severe and asymptomatic groups were compared to local and national healthy controls with adjustments made for age and sex. With the inclusion of hospital staff who had reported localised symptoms only (limited to loss of smell/taste, n = 13) or systemic symptoms not requiring hospital treatment (n = 16), we carried out ordinal logistic regression modelling to determine the relative influence of age, BMI, sex and the presence of specific HLA genes on symptomatology. We found a significant difference in the allele frequency of HLA-DRB1*04:01 in the severe patient compared to the asymptomatic staff group (5.1% vs. 16.7%, P = .003 after adjustment for age and sex). There was a significantly lower frequency of the haplotype DQA1*01:01-DQB1*05:01-DRB1*01:01 in the asymptomatic group compared to the background population (P = .007). Ordinal logistic regression modelling confirmed the significant influence of DRB1*04:01 on the clinical severity of COVID-19 observed in the cohorts. These alleles are found in greater frequencies in the North Western European population. This regional study provides evidence that HLA genotype influences clinical outcome in COVID-19 infection.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic health records across the Northwell Health system. COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 1, 2020, and April 24, 2020, were included. CCS was defined by inflammatory markers: ferritin, > 700 ng/mL; C-reactive protein (CRP), > 30 mg/dL; or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), > 300 U/L. Patients were subdivided into six groups: no immunomodulatory treatment (standard of care) and five groups that received either corticosteroids, anti-IL-6 antibody (tocilizumab), or anti-IL-1 therapy (anakinra) alone or in combination with corticosteroids. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. RESULTS: Five thousand seven hundred seventy-six patients met the inclusion criteria. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (44%-59%), diabetes (32%-46%), and cardiovascular disease (5%-14%). Patients most frequently met criteria with high LDH (76.2%) alone or in combination, followed by ferritin (63.2%) and CRP (8.4%). More than 80% of patients showed an elevated D-dimer. Patients treated with corticosteroids and tocilizumab combination showed lower mortality compared with patients receiving standard-of-care (SoC) treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% CI, 0.35-0.55; P < .0001) and with patients treated with corticosteroids alone (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53-0.83; P = .004) or in combination with anakinra (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50-0.81; P = .003). Corticosteroids when administered alone (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.57-0.76; P < .0001) or in combination with tocilizumab (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.35-0.55; P < .0001) or anakinra (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57-0.81; P < .0001) improved hospital survival compared with SoC treatment. INTERPRETATION: The combination of corticosteroids with tocilizumab showed superior survival outcome when compared with SoC treatment and treatment with corticosteroids alone or in combination with anakinra. Furthermore, corticosteroid use either alone or in combination with tocilizumab or anakinra was associated with reduced hospital mortality for patients with CCS compared with patients receiving SoC treatment.","Narain, Sonali; Stefanov, Dimitre G; Chau, Alice S; Weber, Andrew G; Marder, Galina; Kaplan, Blanka; Malhotra, Prashant; Bloom, Ona; Liu, Audrey; Lesser, Martin L; Hajizadeh, Negin",Chest,363,16

The majority of mountain gorillas are human-habituated to facilitate tourism and research, which brings mountain gorillas into close proximity of people daily. Wild great apes are proven to be susceptible to human pathogens, including viruses that have caused fatal respiratory disease in mountain gorillas (e.g., human metapneumovirus1 ). This is the result of the close genetic relatedness of humans and gorillas as species, and the structural and genetic similarity in molecular receptors that allow viruses to infect cells2 . At the time of writing, there is no evidence that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), has infected a mountain gorilla. However, due to the significant potential for human-to-gorilla transmission, mountain gorilla range States took immediate steps to minimize the COVID-19 threat. These actions included a combination of preventive practice around gorillas and other great apes (e.g., mandatory face mask use, increased ""social"" minimum distancing from gorillas) as well as human public health measures (e.g., daily health/fever screenings, COVID-19 screening, and quarantines). Minimization of the COVID-19 threat also required socioeconomic decision-making and political will, as all gorilla tourism was suspended by late March 2020 and guidelines developed for tourism reopening. A consortium that collaborates and coordinates on mountain gorilla management and conservation, working within an intergovernmental institutional framework, took a multifaceted One Health approach to address the COVID-19 threat to mountain gorillas by developing a phased contingency plan for prevention and response. The aim of this paper is to describe how range States and partners achieved this collaborative planning effort, with intent that this real-world experience will inform similar actions at other great ape sites.","Gilardi, Kirsten; Nziza, Julius; Ssebide, Benard; Syaluha, Eddy Kambale; Muvunyi, Richard; Aruho, Robert; Shalukoma, Chantal; Seguya, Andrew; Masozera, Anna Behm",Am J Primatol,363,6

Both drugs have a known torsadogenic potential, but sparse data are available concerning QT prolongation induced by this association. Our objective was to assess for COVID-19 LRTI variations of QT interval under HCQ/AZT in patients hospitalized, and to compare manual versus automated QT measurements. Before therapy initiation, a baseline 12 lead-ECG was electronically sent to our cardiology department for automated and manual QT analysis (Bazett and Fridericia's correction), repeated 2 days after initiation. According to our institutional protocol (Pasteur University Hospital), HCQ/AZT was initiated only if baseline QTc &#8804; 480ms and potassium level> 4.0 mmol/L.

Baseline average automated QTc was 415 ± 29 ms and lengthened to 438 ± 40 ms after 48 hours of combined therapy. The treatment had to be stopped because of significant QTc prolongation in two out of 71 patients (2.8%). No drug-induced life-threatening arrhythmia, nor death was observed. Automated QTc measurements revealed accurate in comparison with manual QTc measurements.

Herein, we performed phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), tissue and immune-cell specific expression/splicing quantitative trait loci (eQTL/sQTL), and colocalization analyses for genetic risk loci suggestively associated with severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure. Thirteen phenotypes/traits were associated with the severe COVID-19-associated loci at the genome-wide significance threshold, including monocyte counts, fat metabolism traits, and fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. In addition, we identified tissue and immune subtype-specific eQTL associations affecting 48 genes, including several that may directly impact host immune responses, colocalized with the severe COVID-19 GWAS associations, and showed altered expression in single-cell transcriptomes. Collectively, our work demonstrates that host genetic variations associated with multiple genes and traits show genetic pleiotropy with severe COVID-19 and may inform disease etiology.","Moon, Chang; Schilder, Brian M; Raj, Towfique; Huang, Kuan-Lin",iScience,363,22

The immunogenicity and the foreignness of the epitopes towards the human body have to be studied to further confirm their candidacy. The top-scoring epitopes were subjected to molecular docking studies to study their interactions with the corresponding human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system. The CTL epitopes were observed to bind at the peptide-binding groove of the corresponding HLA system, indicating their potency as an epitope candidate.

METHODS: To investigate the epidemiological parameters in SARS-CoV-2 infected cases in Beijing, we studied all confirmed cases and close contacts in Beijing from Jan 1st to Apr 3rd 2020. The epidemiological and virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 602 cases were positive for SARS-CoV-2, including 585 confirmed patients and 17 asymptomatic infections. The imported cases were mainly from Wuhan initially and then from abroad. Among 585 confirmed case-patients, the median age was 39 years old. The mean incubation period was 6.3 days. The secondary attack rate among households was higher than social contacts (15.6 vs 4.6%). The secondary attack rate of healthcare workers (HCWs) was higher than non-HCWs' (7.3 vs 4.2%). The basic reproduction number was 2.0, and the average serial interval was 7.6 days.

We recommend age groupings of 5 years for all health data, except for those younger than 5 years, during which time there are rapid biological and physiological changes that justify a finer disaggregation. Although the focus of this Personal View is on the standardisation of the analysis and display of age groups, we also outline the challenges faced in collecting data on exact age, especially for health facilities and surveillance data. The proposed age disaggregation should facilitate targeted, age-specific policies and actions for health care and disease management.","Diaz, T.; Strong, K. L.; Cao, B. C.; Guthold, R.; Moran, A.

We measured past experiences of positive and negative intergroup contact with Chinese people as predictors of intergroup threat and emotions in the context of the pandemic; and how these processes in turn predicted support for discriminatory policies designed to restrict the freedom of Chinese people in the UK. We tested a novel threat-matching hypothesis which draws upon models of outgroup-specific social perception to predict that the emotional processes underlying contact effects will depend on the specific threat posed by the outgroup. In the present epidemiological context, Chinese people posed a salient threat to individuals’ physical health and welfare. Accordingly, we show that whilst intergroup contact predicted both fear and anger towards the outgroup, the indirect effect of contact on support for Chinese restriction policies via fear was significantly stronger than the indirect effect via anger. Our findings provide a more nuanced understanding of how specific threat and emotions drive intergroup contact effects, and offer important insights for efforts to maintain positive intergroup relations in the face of the crisis.","Alston, Lisa; Meleady, Rose; Seger, Charles R.",Group Processes Intergroup Relat.,363,16

Time series analysis using Bayesian inference,16.90711,12.201632,2020,"BACKGROUND: In July 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak was recognised in the geriatric wards at a subacute campus of the Royal Melbourne Hospital affecting patients and staff. Patients were also admitted to this site after diagnosis in residential care. AIMS: To describe the early symptoms and the outcomes of COVID-19 in older adults. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the facility in July or August 2020 were identified and their medical records were examined to identify symptoms present before and after their diagnosis and to determine their outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 106 patients were identified as having COVID-19, with median age of 84.3 years (range 41-104 years); 64 were diagnosed as hospital inpatients after a median length of stay of 49 days, 31 were transferred from residential aged care facilities with a known diagnosis and 11 were diagnosed after discharge. There were 95 patients included in an analysis of symptom type and timing onset. Overall, 61 (64.2%) were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis of COVID-19, having been diagnosed through screening initiated on site. Of these, 88.6% developed symptoms of COVID-19 within 14 days. The most common initial symptom type was respiratory, but there was wide variation in presentation, including fever, gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, many initially not recognised as being due to COVID-19. Of 104 patients, 32 died within 30 days of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 diagnosis is challenging due to the variance in symptoms. In the context of an outbreak, asymptomatic screening can identify affected patients early in the disease course.","Gregorevic, Kate; Maier, Andrea; Miranda, Roeisa; Loveland, Paula; Miller, Katherine; Buising, Kirsty; Marshall, Caroline; O039,; Gorman, Bronwyn; Tan, Amanda; Staggard, Kylie; Halloran, Tessa; Nguyen, Huong Xuan Thi; Disler, Jessica; Crotty, Frances; Lim, Kai; Cianter, Joseph; Kelly, Cate; Lim, Kwang",Intern Med J,363,24

We described the use of a state-based, population-level surveillance system on COVID-19 prevention and information-seeking behaviors in Florida during the first month of survey administration. METHODS: Beginning in April 2020, respondents of the Florida Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were asked a series of 8 questions about sources of COVID-19 information and prevention behaviors. We analyzed the prevalence of information-seeking and prevention behaviors among respondents who answered at least 1 of the 8 questions (N = 1,004) overall, by demographic characteristics, and by the presence of chronic conditions. RESULTS: Most respondents reported engaging in prevention behaviors, including handwashing (98.2%), reducing or avoiding travel (96.6%), avoiding crowds and public events (96.5%), and keeping household members at home (87.5%); however, the prevalence of prevention behaviors varied significantly by age, sex, and education. The most frequently reported source of COVID-19 information was the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website (40.8%) followed by the Florida Department of Health's website (32.9%). We found significant differences in information sources across all demographic and chronic condition subgroups. A larger proportion of respondents with chronic conditions (vs without chronic conditions) reported consulting their personal doctor for COVID-19 information. CONCLUSION: Understanding the uptake and characteristics associated with individual prevention and information-seeking behaviors at the population level facilitates COVID-19 response efforts. The rapid implementation of COVID-19-related questions in the Florida BRFSS provides a useful model for other population-based surveillance systems.","Gunderson, Justine; Mitchell, Dwayne; Reid, Keshia; Jordan, Melissa",Prev Chronic Dis,363,17

PURPOSE: A barrier to using organs from hepatitis C virus (HCV)-viremic donors is the high cost of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) and concerns about access for recipients after transplantation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate access, cost, and timing for HCV DAAs following transplantation. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective study of HCV-negative adult transplant recipients from June 2017 to December 2019 who received grafts from HCV-viremic and/or HCV-seropositive individuals and became HCV viremic after transplantation. RESULTS: Between June 2017 and December 2019, there were 60 HCV-negative transplant recipients who became viremic after receiving grafts from HCV-viremic or HCV-seropositive donors. Thirty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria (n = 25 with liver transplants, n = 6 with lung transplants, n = 4 with simultaneous liver and kidney transplants, and n = 3 with kidney transplants). Of these patients, 23 had commercial insurance, 13 had Medicare, and 2 had Medicaid. All patients ultimately received insurance coverage for treatment; however, 36 (95%) required prior authorization and 9 (24%) required appeals to obtain insurance coverage. The median time from DAA prescription to insurance approval was 6 days. The median time from transplantation to start of treatment was 29 days (range, 0-84 days). Patients with Medicaid insurance had a significantly longer time to insurance approval (31.5 vs 6 days, P = 0.007). The average out-of-pocket cost to patients was less than $10 a month after patient assistance.All patients who completed treatment and 12-week follow-up after treatment achieved a sustained virologic response (n = 36). CONCLUSION: In this study, all HCV-negative recipients who developed HCV following transplantation had access to DAA therapy, with the majority starting treatment in the first month after transplantation.","Bova, Sarah; Cameron, Andrew; Durand, Christine; Katzianer, Jennifer; LeGrand, Meighan; Boyer, Lauren; Glorioso, Jaime; Toman, Lindsey P",Am. j. health system pharm,363,17

It has also been a catalyst to serious debate in the “tourism academy,” as revealed by a discussion on TRINET Tourism Information Network via email in May 2020. The catalyst to this debate was an email by academic Jim Butcher announcing his work entitled “the war on tourism,” published in an online magazine. Presenting a binary between industry recovery and reform, Butcher’s article denounced a body of tourism work he portrayed as hostile to the industry and as using COVID-19 as an opportunity to attack it. He argued that this resulted in harm to tourism businesses, tourism workers and ordinary tourists. These TRINET discussions worked to present a binary in schools of thought, divided by being either for the tourism industry or against it. This analysis explains how advocates of industry rapid recovery stand opposed to wider efforts to reform tourism to be more ethical, responsible and sustainable. The struggle concerns both the proper role of tourism and tourism academics. Outcomes from this debate have repercussions for the development of the discipline, the education of tourism students and the future of tourism practices.","Higgins-Desbiolles, Freya",J.

We consider a mixed supply and demand shock, and show that depending on the shock parameters (amplitude and duration), our model economy can display V-shaped, U-shaped or W-shaped recoveries, and even an L-shaped output curve with permanent output loss. This is due to the economy getting trapped in a self-sustained ""bad"" state. We then discuss two policies that attempt to moderate the impact of the shock: giving easy credit to firms, and the so-called helicopter money, i.e. injecting new money into the households savings. We find that both policies are effective if strong enough. We highlight the potential danger of terminating these policies too early, although inflation is substantially increased by lax access to credit. Finally, we consider the impact of a second lockdown. While we only discuss a limited number of scenarios, our model is flexible and versatile enough to accommodate a wide variety of situations, thus serving as a useful exploratory tool for a qualitative, scenario-based understanding of post-Covid recovery.

A safe and effective vaccine remains urgently needed. METHOD: We constructed three variants of the recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (residues 331-549) in yeast as follows: (1) a ""wild type"" RBD (RBD219-WT), (2) a deglycosylated form (RBD219-N1) by deleting the first N-glycosylation site, and (3) a combined deglycosylated and cysteine-mutagenized form (C538A-mutated variant (RBD219-N1C1)). We compared the expression yields, biophysical characteristics, and functionality of the proteins produced from these constructs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: These three recombinant RBDs showed similar secondary and tertiary structure thermal stability and had the same affinity to their receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), suggesting that the selected deletion or mutations did not cause any significant structural changes or alteration of function. However, RBD219-N1C1 had a higher fermentation yield, was easier to purify, was not hyperglycosylated, and had a lower tendency to form oligomers, and thus was selected for further vaccine development and evaluation. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: By genetic modification, we were able to design a better-controlled and more stable vaccine candidate, which is an essential and important criterion for any process and manufacturing of biologics or drugs for human use.","Chen, Wen-Hsiang; Wei, Junfei; Kundu, Rakhi Tyagi; Adhikari, Rakesh; Liu, Zhuyun; Lee, Jungsoon; Versteeg, Leroy; Poveda, Cristina; Keegan, Brian; Villar, Maria Jose; de Araujo Leao, Ana C; Rivera, Joanne Altieri; Gillespie, Portia M; Pollet, Jeroen; Strych, Ulrich; Zhan, Bin; Hotez, Peter J; Bottazzi, Maria Elena",Biochim Biophys Acta Gen Subj,363,6

SETTING: Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Epistemonikos COVID-19 in L·OVE Platform, McMaster COVID-19 Evidence Alerts and websites were searched to 15 June 2020. Eligible studies were conducted in high-income countries and used multivariate analyses. PARTICIPANTS: After piloting, screening, data extraction and quality appraisal were performed by a single experienced reviewer. Of 3740 unique records identified, 34 were included that reported on median 596 (range 44-418 794) participants, aged 42-84 years. 19/34 (56%) were good quality. OUTCOMES: Hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, length of stay in hospital or intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, severe disease, mortality. RESULTS: Authors synthesised findings narratively and appraised the certainty of the evidence for each risk factor-outcome association. There was low or moderate certainty evidence for a large (&#8805;2-fold) magnitude of association between hospitalisation in people with COVID-19, and: obesity class III, heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, dementia, age >45 years, male gender, black race/ethnicity (vs non-Hispanic white), homelessness and low income. Age >60 and >70 years may be associated with large increases in mechanical ventilation and severe disease, respectively. For mortality, a large magnitude of association may exist with liver disease, Bangladeshi ethnicity (vs British white), age >45 years, age >80 years (vs 65-69 years) and male gender among 20-64 years (but not older). Associations with hospitalisation and mortality may be very large (&#8805;5-fold) for those aged &#8805;60 years.

The aim of the present paper was to describe the impact of this lockdown on the treatment of injuries. METHODS: We collected hospital data on injury diagnoses from a national emergency preparedness register established during the pandemic. We identified the number of injured patients per day in the period 1 January-30 June 2020, and analysed the change in patient volumes over two three-week periods before and during the lockdown by sex, age, level of care, level of urgency, type of contact and type of injury. RESULTS: Compared to pre-lockdown levels, there was an overall reduction of 43% in injured patients during the first three weeks of lockdown. The decrease in patient contacts did not differ by sex, but was most pronounced among young people. Substantial reductions were observed for both acute and elective treatment and across all levels of care and types of contact, with the exception of indirect patient contacts. The change in patient contacts varied considerably by injury type, with the largest reduction observed for dislocations/sprains/strains. The decrease was much lower for burns/corrosions and poisoning. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial reduction in the treatment of injuries was observed during lockdown in Norway. Possible explanations for this finding include an overall decrease in injury risk, a redistribution of hospital resources and a higher threshold for seeking medical attention as a result of the pandemic.","Ohm, Eyvind; Hauge, Lars J; Madsen, Christian; Grøholt, Else K; Evensen, Miriam; Reneflot, Anne",Scand J Public Health,363,33

The aim of this study was to describe how the COVID-19 related school shutdown impacted the sleep behaviors of typically developing adolescents. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted between April 28 and June 3, 2020 with 45 adolescents using one-on-one semi-structured phone interviews. RESULTS: The ""natural experiment"" caused by the shutdown of schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a 2-h shift in the sleep of typically developing adolescents, longer sleep duration, improved sleep quality, and less daytime sleepiness compared to those experienced under the regular school-time schedule. DISCUSSION: These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that delaying high school start times could be an effective way to extend sleep duration, improve sleep quality, reduce daytime sleepiness and lower adolescents' stress during the school year. As many countries look for ways to reduce the number of interactions between students in schools so that physical distancing is feasible, following teens' delayed sleep biology could offer an affordable solution. For example, staggering arrival times by delaying school start time for older adolescents compared with younger adolescents can reduce the total number of students attending school at the same time. This strategy offers a practical means to reduce school density and the number of interactions between students which are needed to reduce the potential transmission of COVID-19 in schools, while improving adolescents sleep health.","Gruber, Reut; Saha, Sujata; Somerville, Gail; Boursier, Johanne; Wise, Merrill S",Sleep Med,363,14

These proteins require endocytic uptake from the cell surface to be cleaved by cellular proteases within the endosomal compartment, followed by recycling to the plasma membrane for incorporation into budding virions or mediation of cell-cell fusion. This internalization largely depends on a tyrosine-based consensus motif for endocytosis present in the cytoplasmic tail of HeV and NiV F. Given the large number of tyrosine residues present in the F protein cytoplasmic domain of Cedar virus (CedV), a closely related but low pathogenic henipavirus, we aimed to investigate whether CedV F protein undergoes signal-mediated endocytosis from the cell surface controlled by tyrosine-based motifs present in its cytoplasmic tail and whether endocytosis is relevant for its biological activity. Therefore, tyrosine-based signals were mutated, and mutations were assessed for their effect on F cell surface expression, endocytosis, and biological activity. A membrane-proximal YXX&#934; motif and a C-terminal di-tyrosine motif are of particular importance for cell surface expression and endocytosis rate. Furthermore, our data strongly indicate the pivotal role of endocytosis for the biological activity of the CedV F protein.","Fischer, Kerstin; Groschup, Martin H; Diederich, Sandra",,363,6

Dental practitioners are normally guided in practice by set ethical principles, thus the researchers wanted to determine how these rules are managed during this pandemic. METHODS: A protocol specific for the objectives of this study was developed according to the criteria for a scoping review. Relevant databases (Pubmed, Scopus, Elsevier, Science Direct, Wiley), including online access to health/ dental organizations (World Health Organization/ American Dental Association), were searched to identify evidence which was restricted to the English language for the period 2015-2020. Predetermined eligibility criteria were applied, evidence was assessed and data extracted for each included article. Relevant outcomes assessed were: infection control measures, transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, such as modes and sources of transmission and the ethical principles related to the dental setting with a focus on the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Searches yielded a total of 402 articles: 387 from electronic databases and 15 from other sources. Of these, 231 were unrelated to the objectives of the current scoping review. The full text of 69 studies was assessed for eligibility, of which 26 were finalized for inclusion following the objectives and inclusion criteria set for the scoping review. Most of the included articles were reviews, recommendations and guidelines for dentists. A narrative explanation of the pre-specified outcomes is reported for the 3 areas covered for this review. There is no clinical evidence available that can support the recommendations by individuals, dental organizations or health authorities related to the objectives of this review, but these may be considered as the much needed guidelines during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.

Based on the most recent evidence, migraine and fibromyalgia are two conditions with the most favorable outcomes after acupuncture. At the same time, abdominal pain has the least evidence for the use of acupuncture. Acupuncture is efficacious for reducing pain in patients with LBP, and for short-term pain relief for those with neck pain. Further research needs to be done to evaluate acupuncture's efficacy in these conditions, especially for abdominal pain, as many of the current studies have a risk of bias due to lack of blinding and small sample size.","Patel, Megha; Urits, Ivan; Kaye, Alan D; Viswanath, Omar",Best Pract Res Clin Anaesthesiol,363,29

Using the Turkish nationwide centralized COVID-19 database, we sought to determine whether cTn measured within 24 h of admission may help identify 30-day all-cause mortality in hospitalized patients. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at all hospitals in Turkey between March 11, 2020, and June 22, 2020. All hospitalized COVID-19 patients (&#8805;18 years) who had cTn measurements within 24 h of admission were included. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 14,855 COVID-19 patients (median age 49 years and 54% male) from 81 provinces of Turkey were included. Of these, 2020 patients (13.6%) were transferred to intensive care unit, 1165 patients (7.8%) needed mechanical ventilation, and 882 patients (5.9%) died during hospitalization. The prevalence of cTn positivity was 6.9% (n = 1027) in the hospitalized patients. cTn positivity was 5% in those patients alive at 30-day, and 44% in those who died. In multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression model, age, lactate dehydrogenase, and cTn were the strongest predictors of 30-day mortality, irrespective of cTn definition as a continuous, ordinal variable, or dichotomic variables. CONCLUSIONS: A single measurement of cTn at admission in patients with COVID-19 is associated with 30-day all-cause mortality and may have an important prognostic role for optimizing risk stratification.","Tanboga, Ibrahim Halil; Canpolat, Ugur; Özcan Çetin, Elif Hande; Kundi, Harun; Turan, Sema; Celik, Osman; Ata, Naim; Çay, Serkan; Özeke, Özcan; Kaymaz, Cihangir; Topaloglu, Serkan",Atherosclerosis,363,27

There are several commercial ad hoc molecular diagnostic kits currently on the market, many of which have been evaluated by different groups. However, in low resource settings the availability and cost of these commercial kits can be a limiting factor for many diagnostic laboratories. In such cases alternatives need to be identified. With this in mind, eight commercial reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) master mixes from Applied Biosystems (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Bio-Rad, Biotech Rabbit, Promega, Qiagen, QuantaBio, Invitrogen (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Takara using the same commercial primer and probe mix [LightMix® Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene mix (TIB MolBiol, Germany)] were evaluated. Three ad hoc molecular diagnostic kits [GeneFinder&#8482; COVID-19 Plus RealAmp kit (Osang Healthcare); genesig® Real-Time PCR Coronavirus COVID-19 (Primerdesign); and ViroReal® Kit SARS-CoV-2 & SARS-CoV (Ingenetix)] were also included in the study. The limit of detection was calculated for each assay using serial dilutions of a defined clinical sample. The performances of the assays were compared using a panel of 178 clinical samples and their analytical specificity assessed against a panel of human betacoronaviruses. Inter assay agreement was assessed using statistical tests (Bland-Altman, Fleiss-Kappa and Cohen's Kappa) and was shown to be excellent to good in all cases. We conclude that all of the assays evaluated in this study can be used for the routine detection of SARS-CoV-2 and that the RT-qPCR master mixes are a valid alternative to ad hoc molecular diagnostic kits.","Dundon, William G; Settypalli, Tirumala B K; Spiegel, Katharina; Steinrigl, Adi; Revilla-Fernández, Sandra; Schmoll, Friedrich; Naletoski, Ivancho; Lamien, Charles E; Cattoli, Giovanni",J Virol Methods,363,24

The source of the virus for the cats was their COVID-19-affected owner, with whom they were in continuous proximity in a small household setting. The owner's signs included fatigue, sneezing, anosmia and loss of taste, and diagnosis was confirmed 4 days after symptom onset. Oropharyngeal and faecal swabs were collected from the cats, to investigate the course of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations, as well as the directionality of the chain of virus transmission. Both infected cats were real-time RT-PCR-positive on various time-points. Pharyngeal shedding of at least 6 days was observed in them, with high SARS-CoV-2 titres (> 7 Log10 copies/swab) on the first sampling time-point, that is, 7 days after the onset of owner's clinical signs. In one cat, after the initial decline, slightly increasing virus titres were measured 3 to 6 days after the first real-time RT-PCR-positive swab. Serological testing of this cat revealed absence of seroconversion. The course of viral RNA concentrations in the faecal swabs of the other cat was similar to that in its pharynx. The detected SARS-CoV-2 strains, from both infected cats and their owner, underwent whole-genome sequencing, revealing the absence of emergence of cross-species adaptive mutations in cats. The results support the notion that human SARS-CoV-2 strains are relatively well-adapted to cats. It is still unclear whether asymptomatic animals could play a role in COVID-19 epidemiology, in case of interaction with naïve animals and/or people. Our findings highlight difficulties in SARS-CoV-2 transmission to cats, as neither the two infected cats nor their owner was able to transmit the virus to a third cat living in the same small flat, despite their very close contact during the days corresponding to high virus shedding.","Chaintoutis, Serafeim C; Siarkou, Victoria I; Mylonakis, Mathios E; Kazakos, George M; Skeva, Panagiota-Nefeli; Bampali, Maria; Dimitriou, Marios; Dovrolis, Nikolaos; Polizopoulou, Zoe S; Karakasiliotis, Ioannis; Dovas, Chrysostomos I",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Specific partial differential equations (PDEs) such as edge-enhancing diffusion (EED) give high quality reconstructions of image structures with low or medium texture. Even though the strengths of PDE- and transform-based compression are complementary, they have rarely been combined within a hybrid codec. We propose to sparsify blocks of a JPEG compressed image and reconstruct them with EED inpainting. Our codec consistently outperforms JPEG and gives useful indications for successfully developing hybrid codecs further. Furthermore, our method is the first to choose regions rather than pixels as known data for PDE-based compression. It also gives novel insights into the importance of corner regions for EED-based codecs.","Andris, Sarah; Weickert, Joachim; Alt, Tobias; Peter, Pascal",,363,16

OBJECTIVES: This review summarizes the underlying principles and performance of COVID-19 serological and immunological testing. SOURCES: Selected peer-reviewed publications on COVID-19 related serology and immunology published between December 2019 and March 2021. CONTENT: Serological tests are highly specific but heterogeneous in their sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19. For certain indications, including delayed disease presentations, serological tests can have added value. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may indicate a recent or past COVID-19 infection. Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) antibody tests have the advantages of being easy and fast to perform, but many have a low sensitivity in acute settings. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs) have higher sensitivities. Besides humoral immunity, cellular immunity is also essential for successful host defences against viruses. Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays can be used to measure T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2. The presence of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in never exposed patients suggests the possibility of cellular immunity induced by other circulating coronaviruses. T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 have also been detected in recovered COVID-19 patients with no detectable antibodies. IMPLICATIONS: Serological and immunological tests are primarily applied for population-based seroprevalence studies to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control measures and increase our understanding of the immunology behind COVID-19. Combining molecular diagnostics with serological tests may optimize the detection of COVID-19. As not all infected patients will develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, assessment of cellular immunity may provide complementary information on whether a patient has been previously infected with COVID-19. More studies are needed to understand the correlations of these serological and immunological parameters with protective immunity, taking into account the different circulating virus variants.","Ong, David S Y; Fragkou, Paraskevi C; Schweitzer, Valentijn A; Chemaly, Roy F; Moschopoulos, Charalampos D; Skevaki, Chrysanthi",Clin. microbiol. infect,363,24

One hundred and twenty-seven participants completed the survey in May and June, offering a preliminary description of the impact of Shelter in Place (SIP) due to COVID-19 on their wellbeing. The mixed-methods, cross-sectional survey assessed participants' perspectives regarding 1) changes in physical, financial, professional, social, relational, and psychological levels of concern and 2) the general impact of SIP due to COVID-19, as well as the unique impact as a current or former foster youth. Participants reported significant increases in their level of concern in each domain from before SIP orders to during SIP, which was maintained in anticipation of the year following SIP. Participants also described their experiences with SIP and COVID-19 as unique, due to their lived experience as a former foster youth. Findings highlight a need for a coordinated short and long-term response to address the needs and concerns of this vulnerable population.","Ruff, Saralyn C; Linville, Deanna",Child Youth Serv Rev,363,24

While this is shifting somewhat, there remains a considerable need to address the underprioritization of mental health and well-being, perhaps even more so in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, given the history of mental health interventions-which have overemphasized the biomedical model and have thus resulted in coercion, denial of life in the community, and unnecessary pathologization of human experience-there is also a need to ensure that increased funding does not simply replicate these mistakes. This is particularly true in the current landscape, where efforts to ""scale up"" mental health and to reduce ""treatment gaps"" are gaining momentum and where post-pandemic responses are still being formulated. As the potential for global mechanisms for funding mental health increases, national and international funders should look to practices that are rights affirming and contextually relevant. In this paper, I explore the current landscape of mental health financing, in terms of both national resource allocation and development assistance. I then outline the momentum in global mental health that is likely to materialize through increased funding, before considering ways in which that funding might be utilized in a manner that promotes human rights.","Mahomed, Faraaz",Health Hum Rights,363,1

An online survey collected socio-demographic information and assessed for both mental health (depression (PHQ-8), anxiety (GAD-7), PTSD (PCL-C)) and COVID-19-related outcomes (COVID-19-related worries and COVID-19-related grief). Out of 981 participants, 320 (32.6%) identified as SGM. SGM had significantly higher levels of depression and PTSD symptoms as well as COVID-19-related worries and grief than non-SGM, even after controlling for family support, lifetime discrimination, and pre-existing mental health diagnoses. These findings suggest that not only has the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted SGM mental health, but that minority stress factors cannot fully explain this impact. Thus, clinicians and societal stakeholders (schools, employers, policymakers) must think beyond traditional minority stress factors (family support, discrimination) and pre-pandemic disparities to support this vulnerable population as the pandemic progresses.","Kamal, Kanika; Li, Jason J; Hahm, Hyeouk Chris; Liu, Cindy H",Psychiatry Res,363,24

METHODS: A total of 302 discharged COVID-19 patients were included. Discharged patients were followed up for 14 days to 6 months. The modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, Borg rating of perceived exertion, and manual muscle testing (MMT) scores on day 14 and at 6 months after discharge were compared between the re-detectable positive (RP) and non-RP (NRP) groups. Prognoses of respiratory and physical functions were compared between patients who recovered from moderate and severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the patients, 7.6% were RP. The proportion of patients who used antiviral drugs was significantly lower in the RP group than in the NRP group. There were no differences in the mMRC, Borg, and MMT scores within the RP group and the NRP group. The mMRC, Borg, and MMT scores were worse for severe-type cases than for moderate-type cases at both follow-ups. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients who did not take antiviral drugs were more likely to be RP after discharge. However, respiratory and physical function recovery were not related to re-positivity during rehabilitation but to disease severity during hospitalization.","Wu, Qian; Hou, Xinwei; Li, Hongwei; Guo, Jing; Li, Yajie; Yang, Fangfei; Zhang, Yan; Xie, Yi; Li, Li",Int. j. infect. dis,363,30

In a large cohort study Dengvaxia was found to partially protect children who had prior dengue virus (DENV) infections but sensitized seronegative children to breakthrough DENV disease of enhanced severity. In 2019, the European Medicines Agency and the US FDA issued licenses that reconciled safety issues by restricting vaccine to individuals with prior dengue infections. Using revised Dengvaxia efficacy and safety data we sought to estimate hospitalized and severe dengue cases among the more than 800,000 9 year-old children vaccinated in the Philippines. Despite an overall vaccine efficacy of 69% during 4 years post-vaccination we project there will be more than one thousand vaccinated seronegative and seropositive children hospitalized for severe dengue. Assisting these children through a program of enhanced surveillance leading to improved care deserves widespread support. Clinical responses observed during breakthrough dengue infections in vaccinated individuals counsel prudence in design of vaccine policies. Recommendations concerning continued use of this dengue vaccine are: (1) obtain a better definition of vaccine efficacy and safety through enhanced phase 4 surveillance, (2) obtain a valid, accessible, sensitive, specific and affordable serological test that identifies past wild-type dengue virus infection and (3) clarify safety and efficacy of Dengvaxia in flavivirus immunes. In the absence of an acceptable serological screening test these unresolved ethical issues suggest Dengvaxia be given only to those signing informed consent.","Halstead, Scott B; Katzelnick, Leah C; Russell, Philip K; Markoff, Lewis; Aguiar, Maira; Dans, Leonila R; Dans, Antonio L",Vaccine,363,20

We then compare the simulation results of our three epidemiological models of interest against the daily reported COVID-19 case counts across the time period from 23rd January to 6th April 2020. Finally, we compare and evaluate on the performance and accuracy of the aforementioned models simulations. MethodsThree epidemiological models are used to forecast the true growth of COVID-19 case counts by accounting for asymptomatic infections in Singapore. They are the exponential model, SEIR model with hospitalization dynamics (SEIHRD), and the SEIHRD model with inclusion of asymptomatic cases (SEAIHRD). ResultsSimulation results of all three models reflect underestimation of COVID-19 cases in Singapore during the early stages of the pandemic. At a 40% asymptomatic proportion, we report basic reproduction number R0 = 3.28 and 3.74 under the SEIHRD and SEAIHRD models respectively. At a 60% asymptomatic proportion, we report R0 = 3.48 and 3.96 under the SEIHRD and SEAIHRD models respectively. ConclusionsBased on the results of different simulation scenarios, we are highly confident that the number of COVID-19 cases in Singapore was underestimated during the early stages of the pandemic.

Polyploidization is a pivotal event for plant adaption to stress and the expansion of transcription factors. NACs play key roles in plant stress resistance and growth and development, but the adaptive mechanism of NACs during plant polyploidization remain to be explored. Here, we identified and analyzed NACs from 15 species and found that the expansion of NACs was contributed by polyploidization. The regulatory networks were systematically analyzed based on polyomics. NACs might influence plant phenotypes and were correlated with amino acids acting as nitrogen source, indicating that NACs play a vital role in plant development. More importantly, in quinoa and Arabidopsis thaliana, NACs enabled plants to resist stress by regulating flavonoid pathways, and the universality was further confirmed by the Arabidopsis population. Our study provides a cornerstone for future research into improvement of important agronomic traits by transcription factors in a changing global environment.","Liu, Moyang; Sun, Wenjun; Ma, Zhaotang; Yu, Guolong; Li, Jiahao; Wang, Yudong; Wang, Xu",Genomics,363,16

Due to its highly epizootic nature, it has compelled the public health experts to deploy smartphone applications to trace its rapid transmission pattern along with the infected persons as well by utilizing the persons' personally identifiable information. However, these information may summon several undesirable provocations towards the technical experts in terms of privacy and cyber security, particularly the trust concerns. If not resolved by now, the circumstances will affect the mass level population through inadequate usage of the health applications in the smartphones and thus liberate the forgery of a catastrophe for another COVID-19-like zoonosis to come. Therefore, an extensive study was required to address this severe issue. This paper has fulfilled the study mentioned above needed by not only discussing the recently designed and developed health applications all over the regions around the world but also investigating their usefulness and limitations. The trust defiance is identified as well as scrutinized from the viewpoint of an end-user.

The objective of this study was to assess how efficiently primary care physicians at the screening clinic were able to predict whether a patient had COVID-19 or not, based on their symptom-based assessment alone. The current study is a cross-sectional retrospective observational study. This study was conducted at a single-center, tertiary care setting with a dedicated COVID-19 facility in a metropolitan city in eastern India. Participants are all suspected COVID-19 patients who presented themselves to this center during the outbreak from 1 August 2020 to 30 August 2020. Patients were referred to the Cough Clinic from the various outpatient departments of the hospital or from smaller satellite centers located in different parts of the city and other dependent geographical areas. The main outcome(s) and measure(s) is to study whether outcome of confirmatory test results can be predicted accurately by history taking alone. From 01 August 2020 to 30 Aug 2020, 511 patients with at least one symptom suggestive of COVID-19 reported to screening clinic. Out of these, 65.4% were males and 34.6% were females. Median age was 45 years with range being 01 to 92 years. Fever was seen in 70.4% while cough was present in 22% of cases. Overall positivity for SARS-CoV-2 during this period in this group was 54.21%. At 50% pre-test probability, the sensitivity of trained doctors working at the clinic, in predicting positive cases based on symptoms alone, was approximately 74.7%, and specificity for the same was 58.12%. The positive predictive value of the doctors' assessment was 67.87%, and the negative predictive value was 66.02%. Rapid triaging for confirmatory diagnosis of COVID-19 is feasible at screening clinic based on history taking alone by training of primary care physicians. This is particularly relevant in LMIC with scarce healthcare resources to overcome COVID-19 pandemic.","Nayan, Neelabh; Kumar, M Krishna; Nair, Ranjith K; Manral, Ishita; Ghosh, Snehasree; Bhalla, Sharad; Singh, Jasdeep; Monga, Anuradha; Afzal, Mohd; Kapoor, Rajan",SN Compr Clin Med,363,1

The placenta has unique, intrinsic features because it plays many roles during gestation: it is formed by cells from two individuals (mother and fetus), contributes to the development and growth of an allogeneic fetus, and has two independent and interacting circulatory systems. Different stem and progenitor cell types can be isolated from the different perinatal tissues making them particularly interesting candidates for use in cell therapy and regenerative medicine. The primary source of perinatal stem cells is cord blood. Cord blood has been a well-known source of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells since 1974. Biobanked cord blood has been used to treat different hematological and immunological disorders for over 30 years. Other perinatal tissues that are routinely discarded as medical waste contain non-hematopoietic cells with potential therapeutic value. Indeed, in advanced perinatal cell therapy trials, mesenchymal stromal cells are the most commonly used. Here, we review one by one the different perinatal tissues and the different perinatal stem cells isolated with their phenotypical characteristics and the preclinical uses of these cells in numerous pathologies. An overview of clinical applications of perinatal derived cells is also described with special emphasis on the clinical trials being carried out to treat COVID19 pneumonia. Furthermore, we describe the use of new technologies in the field of perinatal stem cells and the future directions and challenges of this fascinating and rapidly progressing field of perinatal cells and regenerative medicine.","Torre, Paz de la; Flores, Ana I",,363,24

METHODS: In this study, 590 COVID-19 patients during hospitalization were enrolled (Training set: n = 285; Internal validation set: n = 127; Prospective set: n = 178). After filtered by two machine learning methods in the training set, 5 out of 31 clinical features were selected into the model building to predict the risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to build the prediction nomogram and validated in two different sets. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate its performance. RESULTS: From 31 potential predictors in the training set, 5 independent predictive factors were identified and included in the risk score: C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Age, Charlson/Deyo comorbidity score (CDCS), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Subsequently, we generated the nomogram based on the above features for predicting severe COVID-19. In the training cohort, the area under curves (AUCs) were 0.822 (95% CI, 0.765-0.875) and the internal validation cohort was 0.762 (95% CI, 0.768-0.844). Further, we validated it in a prospective cohort with the AUCs of 0.705 (95% CI, 0.627-0.778). The internally bootstrapped calibration curve showed favorable consistency between prediction by nomogram and the actual situation. And DCA analysis also conferred high clinical net benefit. CONCLUSION: In this study, our predicting model based on five clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients will enable clinicians to predict the potential risk of developing critical illness and thus optimize medical management.","Yao, Zhixian; Zheng, Xinyi; Zheng, Zhong; Wu, Ke; Zheng, Junhua",Immun Inflamm Dis,363,16

Its effectivity can be quantified by modifying the standard methodology for analyzing percolation and connectivity of contact networks. We apply this framework to networks with varying degree distributions, numbers of application users, and probabilities of quarantine failures. Further, we study structured populations with homophily and heterophily and the possibility of degree-targeted application distribution. Our results are based on a combination of explicit simulations and mean-field analysis. They indicate that there can be major differences in the epidemic size and epidemic probabilities which are equivalent in the normal SIR processes. Further, degree heterogeneity is seen to be especially important for the epidemic threshold but not as much for the epidemic size. The probability that tracing leads to quarantines is not as important as the application adoption rate. Finally, both strong homophily and especially heterophily with regard to application adoption can be detrimental. Overall, epidemic dynamics are very sensitive to all of the parameter values we tested out, which makes the problem of estimating the effect of digital contact tracing an inherently multidimensional problem.","Rizi, Abbas K.; Faqeeh, Ali; Badie-Modiri, Arash; Kivela, Mikko",,363,24

AIM: To evaluate the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and their associated factors as well as the effects and attitudes towards online education in Chinese high school students. METHODS: A total of 883 students were included. The first, second and third-year students of a high school in Lanzhou, Gansu province of China were invited to participate in this study. They were requested to involve their parents to complete the survey together. A detailed questionnaire of 65 questions was designed and divided into five sections. The survey was anonymously conducted via WeChat, a Chinese multipurpose messaging, social media and mobile payment app. RESULTS: Overall, 32.94% of students experienced post-traumatic stress disorder due to the COVID-19 epidemic. The majority of students (60.82%) felt that online education was not (10.76%) or less effective (50.06%) in terms of gaining knowledge and improving practical and communications skills. Correlation analysis revealed that the class level, residential background and whether living with parents were significantly linked with the effectiveness and satisfaction of the online education system. Of the final year students, 74.2% said that the COVID-19 outbreak has negatively affected their preparation for the college entrance exam, and 68% of students felt that this outbreak increased psychological pressure for their college entrance examination preparation. In case of having COVID-19 symptoms during the exam, 50.7%, 13.3%, and 10.2% would notify the proctor, teacher and parents, respectively. CONCLUSION: We found a high prevalence rate of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in high school students. Thus, our results call for urgent attention from both government and schools to implement effective interventions to cope with the psychological effects and the disturbance of education by COVID-19 on children.","Ma, Z.

In the early phase of infection, T- and B-cell counts are substantially decreased6,7; however, IgM8-11 and IgG12-14 are detectable within 14 d after symptom onset. In COVID-19-convalescent individuals, spike-specific neutralizing antibodies are variable3,15,16. No specific drug or vaccine is available for COVID-19 at the time of writing; however, patients benefit from treatment with serum from COVID-19-convalescent individuals17,18. Nevertheless, antibody responses and cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses in COVID-19-convalescent individuals are largely unknown. Here, we show that the majority of COVID-19-convalescent individuals maintained SARS-CoV-2 spike S1- and S2-specific antibodies with neutralizing activity against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, and that some of the antibodies cross-neutralized SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus or both pseudotyped viruses. Convalescent individuals who experienced severe COVID-19 showed higher neutralizing antibody titres, a faster increase in lymphocyte counts and a higher frequency of CXCR3+ T follicular help (TFH) cells compared with COVID-19-convalescent individuals who experienced non-severe disease. Circulating TFH cells were spike specific and functional, and the frequencies of CXCR3+ TFH cells were positively associated with neutralizing antibody titres in COVID-19-convalescent individuals. No individuals had detectable autoantibodies. These findings provide insights into neutralizing antibody responses in COVID-19-convalescent individuals and facilitate the treatment and vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zhang, Jian; Wu, Qian; Liu, Ziyan; Wang, Qijie; Wu, Jiajing; Hu, Yabin; Bai, Tingting; Xie, Ting; Huang, Mincheng; Wu, Tiantian; Peng, Danhong; Huang, Weijin; Jin, Kun; Niu, Ling; Guo, Wangyuan; Luo, Dixian; Lei, Dongzhu; Wu, Zhijian; Li, Guicheng; Huang, Renbin; Lin, Yingbiao; Xie, Xiangping; He, Shuangyan; Deng, Yunfan; Liu, Jianghua; Li, Weilang; Lu, Zhongyi; Chen, Haifu; Zeng, Ting; Luo, Qingting; Li, Yi-Ping; Wang, Youchun; Liu, Wenpei; Qu, Xiaowang",Nat. microbiol,363,16

Prevention and control strategies require an improved understanding of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics. We did a rapid review of the literature on SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics with a focus on infective dose. We sought comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We examined laboratory animal and human studies. The literature on infective dose, transmission and routes of exposure was limited specially in humans, and varying endpoints were used for measurement of infection. Despite variability in animal studies, there was some evidence that increased dose at exposure correlated with higher viral load clinically, and severe symptoms. Higher viral load measures did not reflect coronavirus disease 2019 severity. Aerosol transmission seemed to raise the risk of more severe respiratory complications in animals. An accurate quantitative estimate of the infective dose of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is not currently feasible and needs further research. Our review suggests that it is small, perhaps about 100 particles. Further work is also required on the relationship between routes of transmission, infective dose, co-infection and outcomes.","Karimzadeh, Sedighe; Bhopal, Raj; Nguyen Tien, Huy",Epidemiol Infect,363,1

METHODS: Two biomedical databases were searched between September 2019 and June 2020 for case reports and series of pregnant women with a diagnosis of COVID-19 based either on a positive swab or high clinical suspicion where no swab had been performed. Additional registry cases known to the authors were included. Steps were taken to minimise duplicate patients. Information on coagulopathy based on abnormal coagulation test results or clinical evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and on arterial or venous thrombosis, were extracted using a standard form. If available, detailed laboratory results and information on maternal outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: One thousand sixty-three women met the inclusion criteria, of which three (0.28, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.6) had arterial and/or venous thrombosis, seven (0.66, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.1) had DIC, and a further three (0.28, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.6) had coagulopathy without meeting the definition of DIC.

Among the recruited participants, 10 (25.6%) required ECMO (ICU-ECMO group) and 29 (74.4%) did not have ECMO support (ICU group). Immunological parameters were assessed both at ICU admission and on a daily basis for 7 consecutive days. RESULTS: The absolute lymphocyte count increased significantly in the ICU-ECMO group compared to the ICU group in which it remained relatively stable: ß for the time variable was 127.1 [95% CI 68.9 - 185.3], p < 0.001 and for the interaction term -141.36 [-208.95 - -73.77], p < 0.001.

Results showed that patients with OCD had higher scores on all OC symptom dimensions and symptom severity during the pandemic as compared to their scores from before the pandemic. Thus, the effect of COVID-19 is not limited to an increase in fears of contamination alone, but occurs across other symptom dimensions, including responsibility for harm, unacceptable thoughts, and symmetry. In addition, regression analyses indicated that COVID-19-related stress responses significantly predicted the observed increase in specific OC symptom dimensions and general severity, after controlling for pre-COVID-19 scores of symptoms and severity.

At the sector level, coping involved the ability to meet an increased water demand with a remote workforce. Lessons learned highlight the importance of communication and collaboration.

Differentiation between pure viral COVID-19 pneumonia and secondary infection can be challenging. In patients with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) on admission physicians often decide to prescribe antibiotic therapy. However, overuse of anti-infective therapy in the pandemic should be avoided to prevent increasing antimicrobial resistance. Procalcitonin (PCT) and CRP have proven useful in other lower respiratory tract infections and might help to differentiate between pure viral or secondary infection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients admitted with COVID-19 between 6th March and 30th October 2020. Patient background, clinical course, laboratory findings with focus on PCT and CRP levels and microbiology results were evaluated. Patients with and without secondary bacterial infection in relation to PCT and CRP were compared. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the best discriminating cut-off value of PCT and CRP with the corresponding sensitivity and specificity was calculated. RESULTS: Out of 99 inpatients (52 ICU, 47 Non-ICU) with COVID-19, 32 (32%) presented with secondary bacterial infection during hospitalization. Patients with secondary bacterial infection had higher PCT (0.4 versus 0.1 ng/mL; p = 0.016) and CRP (131 versus 73 mg/L; p = 0.001) levels at admission and during the hospital stay (2.9 versus 0.1 ng/mL; p < 0.001 resp. 293 versus 94 mg/L; p < 0.001). The majority of patients on general ward had no secondary bacterial infection (93%). More than half of patients admitted to the ICU developed secondary bacterial infection (56%). ROC analysis of highest PCT resp. CRP and secondary infection yielded AUCs of 0.88 (p < 0.001) resp. 0.86 (p < 0.001) for the entire cohort. With a PCT cut-off value at 0.55 ng/mL, the sensitivity was 91% with a specificity of 81%; a CRP cut-off value at 172 mg/L yielded a sensitivity of 81% with a specificity of 76%. CONCLUSION: PCT and CRP measurement on admission and during the course of the disease in patients with COVID-19 may be helpful in identifying secondary bacterial infections and guiding the use of antibiotic therapy.","Pink, Isabell; Raupach, David; Fuge, Jan; Vonberg, Ralf-Peter; Hoeper, Marius M; Welte, Tobias; Rademacher, Jessica",Infection,363,3

This evolution results in the emergence of novel variants with different characteristics than their ancestral strain. Several recent reports have described a series of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. Some of these have been identified as variants of concern (VOCs), including alpha (B.1.1.7, Clade GRY), beta (B.1.351, Clade GH), gamma (P.1, Clade GR), and delta (B.1.617.2, Clade G). VOCs are likely to have some effect on transmissibility, antibody evasion, and changes in therapeutic or vaccine effectiveness. However, the physiological and virological understanding of these variants remains poor. We demonstrated that these four VOCs exhibited differences in plaque size, thermal stability at physiological temperature, and replication rates. The mean plaque size of beta was the largest, followed by those of gamma, delta, and alpha. Thermal stability, evaluated by measuring infectivity and half-life after prolonged incubation at physiological temperature, was correlated with plaque size in all variants except alpha. However, despite its relatively high thermal stability, alphas small plaque size resulted in lower replication rates and fewer progeny viruses. Our findings may inform further virological studies of SARS-CoV-2 variant characteristics, VOCs, and variants of interest. These studies are important for the effective management of the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPORTANCEThe global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 continues to persist, due in part to mutations that have resulted in the emergence of different variants. Many of these variants have become more virulent and infectious than their ancestral strain, resulting in an ever-increasing spread. However, our virological understanding of these variants remains poor. Here, we directly compared the plaque size, stability, and replication kinetics of four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern following prolonged incubation at physiological temperatures. Our observations may help to characterize each variant in terms of their interactions with host factors and responses to environmental conditions. We also believe that our evaluations will improve understanding of the emergence of new variants and contribute to controlling their spread.","Jeong, Gi Uk; Yoon, Gun Young; Moon, Hyun Woo; Lee, Wooseong; Hwang, Insu; Kim, Hae Soo; Kim, Kyun-Do; Kim, Chonsaeng; Ahn, Dae-Gyun; Kim, Bum-Tae; Kim, Seong-Jun; Kwon, Young-Chan",,363,6

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all SARS-coV2-RNA-positive patients treated with tocilizumab or anakinra in Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Local experts developed and implemented criteria to define COVID19-CS. All variables were extracted from electronic health records. RESULTS: At tocilizumab initiation (n = 52), 50 (96.2%) were intubated, and only seven (13.5%) received concomitant corticosteroids. At anakinra initiation (n = 41), 23 (56.1%) were intubated, and all received concomitant corticosteroids. Fewer anakinra-treated patients died (n = 9, 22%) and more were extubated/never intubated (n = 26, 63.4%) compared to tocilizumab-treated patients (n = 24, 46.2% dead, n = 22, 42.3% extubated/never intubated). Patients who died had more severe sepsis and respiratory failure and met COVID-CS laboratory criteria longer (median = 3 days) compared to those extubated/never intubated (median = 1 day). After accounting for differences in disease severity at treatment initiation, this apparent superiority of anakinra over tocilizumab was no longer statistically significant (propensity score-adjusted hazards ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.18-1.20). CONCLUSIONS: Prompt identification and treatment of COVID19-CS before intubation may be more important than the specific type of anti-inflammatory treatment. Randomized controlled trials of targeted anti-cytokine treatments and corticosteroids should report the duration of cytokine storm in addition to clinical severity at randomization.","Langer-Gould, Annette; Smith, Jessica B; Gonzales, Edlin G; Castillo, Rhina D; Figueroa, Judith Garza; Ramanathan, Anusha; Li, Bonnie H; Gould, Michael K",Int J Infect Dis,363,23

This study aimed to determine whether COVID-19-free surgical pathways were associated with lower postoperative pulmonary complication rates compared with hospitals with no defined pathway. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This international, multicenter cohort study included patients who underwent elective surgery for 10 solid cancer types without preoperative suspicion of SARS-CoV-2. Participating hospitals included patients from local emergence of SARS-CoV-2 until April 19, 2020. At the time of surgery, hospitals were defined as having a COVID-19-free surgical pathway (complete segregation of the operating theater, critical care, and inpatient ward areas) or no defined pathway (incomplete or no segregation, areas shared with patients with COVID-19). The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative pulmonary complications (pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, unexpected ventilation). RESULTS: Of 9,171 patients from 447 hospitals in 55 countries, 2,481 were operated on in COVID-19-free surgical pathways. Patients who underwent surgery within COVID-19-free surgical pathways were younger with fewer comorbidities than those in hospitals with no defined pathway but with similar proportions of major surgery. After adjustment, pulmonary complication rates were lower with COVID-19-free surgical pathways (2.2% v 4.9%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.86). This was consistent in sensitivity analyses for low-risk patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists grade 1/2), propensity score-matched models, and patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 preoperative tests. The postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was also lower in COVID-19-free surgical pathways (2.1% v 3.6%; aOR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.76). CONCLUSION: Within available resources, dedicated COVID-19-free surgical pathways should be established to provide safe elective cancer surgery during current and before future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.","Glasbey, James C; Nepogodiev, Dmitri; Simoes, Joana F F; Omar, Omar; Li, Elizabeth; Venn, Mary L; Abou Chaar, Mohammad K; Capizzi, Vita; Chaudhry, Daoud; Desai, Anant; Edwards, Jonathan G; Evans, Jonathan P; Fiore, Marco; Videria, Jose Flavio; Ford, Samuel J; Ganly, Ian; Griffiths, Ewen A; Gujjuri, Rohan R; Kolias, Angelos G; Kaafarani, Haytham M A; Minaya-Bravo, Ana; McKay, Siobhan C; Mohan, Helen M; Roberts, Keith J; San Miguel-Méndez, Carlos; Pockney, Peter; Shaw, Richard; Smart, Neil J; Stewart, Grant D; Sundar Mrcog, Sudha; Vidya, Raghavan; Bhangu, Aneel A",J Clin Oncol,363,10

DESIGN: Annual interviews with cross-sectional sentinel samples conducted face-to-face in 2016-19 and via video conferencing or telephone in 2020. Data were collected via an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. SETTING: Australian capital cities. PARTICIPANTS: Australians aged 16 years or older who used ecstasy/MDMA and other illicit stimulants on a monthly or more frequent basis and resided in a capital city, recruited via social media and word-of-mouth (n ~ 800 each year). MEASUREMENTS: Key outcome measures were self-reported illicit drug market indicators (price, purity and availability) and, in 2020 only, perceived change in drug use (including alcohol and tobacco) since March 2020 and reasons for this change. FINDINGS: For most drugs, participants reported either no change or a reduction in their use since COVID-19 restrictions were introduced. Ecstasy/MDMA was the drug most frequently cited as reduced in use (n = 552, 70% of those reporting recent use), mainly due to reduced opportunities for socialization. While market indicators were largely stable across most drugs, the odds of perceiving MDMA capsules as 'high' in purity decreased compared with 2016-19 [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53-0.99], as did perceiving them as 'easy' to obtain (aOR = 0.42, CI = 0.26-0.67).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech-language therapists and their patients experienced restrictions regarding the usual face-to-face therapy. Teletherapy has become a highly discussed medium for providing therapy services. This study aimed at assessing Austrian therapists' attitudes towards teletherapy, including perceived barriers, during and before the COVID-19 lockdown. Further interest referred to therapists' technical affinity and experiences with the application of teletherapy. METHODS: Therapists (n = 325) completed an online survey amid the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. Retrospective indications referred to the time prior to the lockdown. Ratings were opposed across the three therapeutic professions. Subgroup analyses investigated the role of gender and age regarding technical affinity. Measures included custom-made attitudinal statements towards teletherapy and the standardized TA-EG survey. RESULTS: The COVID-19 lockdown caused attitude changes towards teletherapy - for example, in terms of interest (r = 0.57, p > 0.01), perceived skills for performance of teletherapy (r = 0.33, p > 0.01) and perceived need for physical contact with patients (r = 0.35, p > 0.01). Regarding technical affinity, women reported significantly higher values than men did (r = 0.32, p > 0.01). Nearly half of the participants already applied teletherapy, with mainly positive ratings regarding perceived skills and feasibility. Barriers identified were missing or unstable reimbursement policies by insurance companies and therapeutic software with guaranteed data security. DISCUSSION: Austrian therapists indicate a relatively high level of telehealth positivity, with an improvement in the course of the COVID-19 lockdown. However, therapists outline the need for stable reimbursement policies and secure software solutions.","Rettinger, Lena; Klupper, Carissa; Werner, Franz; Putz, Peter",J Telemed Telecare,363,1

STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study of all live deliveries at Boston Medical Center between April 1, 2020 and July 22, 2020 compares the outcomes of pregnant women with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive diagnosis and pregnant women without COVID-19. The primary outcomes are QBL and obstetric hemorrhage. The secondary outcomes analyzed were a maternal composite outcome that consisted of obstetric hemorrhage, telemetry-level (intermediate care unit) or intensive care unit, transfusion, length of stay greater than 5 days, or intraamniotic infection, and individual components of the maternal composite outcome. Groups were compared using Student's t-test, Chi-squared tests, or Fisher's exact. Logistic regression was used to adjust for confounding variables. RESULTS: Of 813 women who delivered a live infant between April 1 and July 22, 2020, 53 women were diagnosed with COVID-19 on admission to the hospital. Women with a COVID-19 diagnosis at their time of delivery were significantly more likely to identify as a race other than white (p = 0.01), to deliver preterm (p = 0.05), to be diagnosed with preeclampsia with severe features (p < 0.01), and to require general anesthesia (p < 0.01). Women diagnosed with COVID-19 did not have a significantly higher QBL (p = 0.64).

WHO, UNICEF and Gavi warn that at least 80 million children under the age of 1 are at risk of contracting diseases such as diphtheria, measles and polio due to the interruption of routine immunization and the temporary suspension of 93 campaigns of large-scale vaccination.In Spain, a new healthcare scenario, which prioritizes telematics over in person, fear of contagion by going to health centers, and recommendations for physical distance and restricted mobility, reduce attendance at primary care centers. Despite recommendations established by the health authorities, vaccination coverage has decreased in all Autonomous Communities between 5% and 60%, depending on the age and type of vaccine. School vaccinations have been suspended and only vaccination of pregnant women against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis has been maintained. The decrease has been more evident for non gratuity vaccines: the first dose of meningococcal vaccine B has decreased by 68.4% in the Valencian Community, and Andalusia has observed a 39% decrease in the total doses of this vaccine and of 18% for that of rotavirus.The recovering of vaccinations should be planned, organized and carried out in the shortest possible time.This article discusses some aspects of the recovery of vaccination coverage for different groups: children, adolescents and adults, and patients at risk and in special situations.","Moraga-Llop, F A; Fernández-Prada, M; Grande-Tejada, A M; Martínez-Alcorta, L I; Moreno-Pérez, D; Pérez-Martín, J J",Vacunas (Madrid),363,17

The objective of the study was to determine the association between high risk of OSA, comorbidities, and increased risk for COVID-19, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional population-based web survey in adults in 14 countries/regions. The survey included sociodemographic variables and comorbidities. Participants were asked questions about COVID-19, hospitalization, and ICU treatment. Standardized questionnaire (STOP questionnaire for high risk of OSA) was included. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted adjusting for various factors. RESULTS: Out of 26,539 respondents, 20,598 (35.4% male) completed the survey. Mean age and BMI of participants were 41.5 ± 16.0 years and 24.0 ± 5.0 kg/m2, respectively. The prevalence of physician-diagnosed OSA was 4.1% and high risk of OSA was 9.5%. We found that high risk of OSA (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20, 2.47) and diabetes (aOR 2.07, 95% CI: 1.23, 3.48) were associated with reporting of a COVID-19 diagnosis. High risk for OSA (aOR 2.11, 95% CI: 1.10-4.01), being male (aOR: 2.82, 95% CI: 1.55-5.12), having diabetes (aOR: 3.93, 95% CI: 1.70-9.12), and having depression (aOR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.15-4.77) were associated with increased risk of hospitalization or ICU treatment.

Currently available rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigens (Ag) have sensitivity well below PCR. The correlation of Ag and RNA quantities in clinical nasopharyngeal (NP) samples is unknown. An ultrasensitive, quantitative electrochemiluminescence immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (the MSD S-PLEX SARS-CoV-2 N assay) was used to measure Ag in clinical NP samples from adults and children previously tested by PCR. The S-PLEX Ag assay had a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.16 pg/ml and a cutoff of 0.32 pg/ml. Ag concentrations measured in clinical NP samples (collected in 3.0 ml of media) ranged from less than 160 fg/ml to 2.7 µg/ml. Log-transformed Ag concentrations correlated tightly with CT values. In 35 adult and 101 pediatric PCR-positive samples, the sensitivities were 91% (95% confidence interval, 77 to 98%) and 79% (70 to 87%), respectively. In samples with a CT of &#8804;35, the sensitivities were 100% (88 to 100%) and 96% (88 to 99%), respectively. In 50 adult and 40 pediatric PCR-negative specimens, the specificities were 100% (93 to 100%) and 98% (87 to 100%), respectively. Nucleocapsid concentrations in clinical NP samples span 8 orders of magnitude and correlate closely with RNA concentrations (CT values). The S-PLEX Ag assay showed 96 to 100% sensitivity in samples from children and adults with CT values of &#8804;35, and a specificity of 98 to 100%. These results clarify Ag concentration distributions in clinical samples, providing insight into the performance of Ag RDTs and offering a new approach to diagnosis of COVID-19.","Pollock, Nira R; Savage, Timothy J; Wardell, Hanna; Lee, Rose A; Mathew, Anu; Stengelin, Martin; Sigal, George B",J. clin. microbiol,363,16

Here, we followed up on this work by assessing an i.n. particle only route of exposure using the LMA mucosal atomization device (MAD). Six AGMs were infected with SARS-CoV-2; three animals were euthanized near the peak stage of virus replication (day 5) and three animals were euthanized during the early convalescence period (day 34). All six AGMs supported robust SARS-CoV-2 replication and developed respiratory disease. Evidence of coagulation dysfunction as noted by a transient increases in aPTT and circulating levels of fibrinogen was observed in all AGMs. The level of SARS-CoV-2 replication and lung pathology was not quite as pronounced as previously reported with AGMs exposed by the combined i.n. and i.t. routes; however, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nasal swabs of some animals as late as day 15 and rectal swabs as late as day 28 after virus challenge. Of particular importance to this study, all three AGMs that were followed until the early convalescence stage of COVID-19 showed substantial lung pathology at necropsy as evidenced by multifocal chronic interstitial pneumonia and increased collagen deposition in alveolar walls despite the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 in any of the lungs of these animals. These findings are consistent with human COVID-19 further demonstrating that the AGM faithfully reproduces the human condition.","Cross, Robert W; Agans, Krystle N; Prasad, Abhishek N; Borisevich, Viktoriya; Woolsey, Courtney; Deer, Daniel J; Dobias, Natalie S; Geisbert, Joan B; Fenton, Karla A; Geisbert, Thomas W",Virol J,363,6

In the UK, units have cancelled elective surgery and a decrease in aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) was favoured. Centres around the world advocate the use of negative pressure environments for AGPs in reducing the spread of infectious airborne particles. We present an overview of operating theatre ventilation systems and the respective evidence with relation to surgical site infection (SSI) and airborne pathogen transmission in light of COVID-19. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Cochrane Library and MEDLINE databases. Search terms included ""COVID-19"", ""theatre ventilation"", ""laminar"", ""turbulent"" and ""negative pressure"". FINDINGS: Evidence for laminar flow ventilation in reducing the rate of SSI in orthopaedic surgery is widely documented. There is little evidence to support its use in general surgery. Following previous viral outbreaks, some centres have introduced negative pressure ventilation in an attempt to decrease exposure of airborne pathogens to staff and surrounding areas. This has again been suggested during the COVID-19 pandemic. A limited number of studies show some positive results for the use of negative pressure ventilation systems and reduction in spread of pathogens; however, cost, accessibility and duration of conversion remain an unexplored issue. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to advocate large scale conversion at this time. Nevertheless, it may be useful for each centre to have its own negative pressure room available for AGPs and high risk patients.","Theodorou, C; Simpson, G S; Walsh, C J",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,363,16

COVID-19 is predominantly transmitted by respiratory droplets; in the clinical setting, aerosol generating procedures pose the greatest risk for COVID-19 transmission. Bronchoscopy is associated with increased risk of patient-to-health care worker transmission, owing to aerosolized viral particles which may be inhaled and also result in environmental contamination of surfaces. METHODS: We describe our experience with the use of modified full-face snorkeling masks for pediatric bronchoscopy procedures in four COVID-19 infected children when filtering facepieces/respirators were in limited supply. RESULTS: Bronchoscopy was urgently required in four children, and could not be delayed until COVID-19 test results were available. During the pandemic peak, when respirators were in short supply, modified full-face snorkel masks (SEAC Libera, SEAC, Italy) were worn by the bronchoscopy team. Each mask was fitted with an O-ring, adapter, and heat and moisture exchanger filter. To date, there have been no COVID-19 infections among the bronchoscopy team staff, whereas the overall Hospital staff COVID-19 prevalence rate has exceeded 13.5% (667/4949).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of the parents of pediatric patients about dental treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic through a questionnaire. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A structured questionnaire consisting of 15 multiple-choice questions and demographic information about the knowledge and attitudes of parents regarding dental treatment during the COVID-19 outbreak was used for the study. The participants were parents of pediatric patients (aged 8-14 years) who visited for a routine orthodontic examination at the department of orthodontics. RESULTS: A total of 250 participants responded to the questionnaire. The findings indicate that more than 95% of parents had information about the transmission paths of the virus, took COVID-19 seriously, and told their children about this disease. 34% of the parents thought that dental clinics were more dangerous than other social areas, and 39.2% thought their children could be infected by medical instruments during dental treatment. A statistically significant difference was observed between educational levels in the answers given about the transmission paths of the virus, the danger of dental clinics in terms of the virus, the permitted dental treatment procedures, and the personal protective equipment of the dentist (p < 0.05).

The scarce evidence published to date suggests that perinatal mental health has deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the few studies published so far have some limitations, such as a cross-sectional design and the omission of important factors for the understanding of perinatal mental health, including governmental restriction measures and healthcare practices implemented at the maternity hospitals. Within the Riseup-PPD COST Action, a study is underway to assess the impact of COVID-19 in perinatal mental health. The primary objectives are to (1) evaluate changes in perinatal mental health outcomes; and (2) determine the risk and protective factors for perinatal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we will compare the results between the countries participating in the study. METHODS: This is an international prospective cohort study, with a baseline and three follow-up assessments over a six-month period. It is being carried out in 11 European countries (Albania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Israel, Malta, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom), Argentina, Brazil and Chile. The sample consists of adult pregnant and postpartum women (with infants up to 6 months of age). The assessment includes measures on COVID-19 epidemiology and public health measures (Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker dataset), Coronavirus Perinatal Experiences (COPE questionnaires), psychological distress (BSI-18), depression (EPDS), anxiety (GAD-7) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSD checklist for DSM-V). DISCUSSION: This study will provide important information for understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health and well-being, including the identification of potential risk and protective factors by implementing predictive models using machine learning techniques.

The article traces the way relative deprivation has been used in the past to understand crime and how it has connections to other, more recent, additions to debates on social justice. I argue that relative deprivation has disappeared even in the place that it had become the key explanation for crime-left realism. In so doing, I explore the resurrection of left realism in criminology-what I refer to as ""post-millennial left realism""-first, by those who were associated with it originally, and then with Hall and Winlow's (2015, 2017) shift in emphasis to what they term ""ultra-realism."" I maintain that relative deprivation is still a powerful concept for bridging several related areas that should still be central to the concerns of criminology-in part, because it is still a major concern in popular social science and social psychology. Why has it disappeared in criminology? I present an argument that suggests that the absence of certain research methods, such as ethnographic and qualitative or small-scale survey methods, has impoverished our understanding of the lived reality of people experiencing the social transformations of a networked, precarious society. The massive polarization and disruption in politics and social discourse, as well as the worldwide economic, public health, and social transformations (ranging from the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter protests to the COVID-19 global pandemic) have demonstrated the continued relevance and analytical power that relative deprivation, in its elaborated form, brings to questions of crime and justice.","Webber, Craig",Crit Criminol,363,1

The aim of this study was to predict the frequency of vaccine refusal against domestic and foreign COVID-19 vaccines and identify the factors underlying refusal. METHODS: A survey consisting of 16 questions about COVID-19 vaccination was conducted either face-to-face or online with 428 parents who agreed to participate in the study. The parents had children who were inpatients or outpatients in the Children's Hospital of Ankara City Hospital. In the survey, parents were asked about family sociodemographic characteristics, opinions on domestic and foreign COVID-19 vaccines, and reasons for vaccine refusal. RESULTS: While 66.1% of parents were reluctant to receive foreign COVID-19 vaccines, only 37.4% were reluctant to receive domestic COVID-19 vaccines. The participants' preference for the domestic vaccine was significantly higher for themselves and their children (P < 0.05). Women were less likely to be willing to receive foreign vaccines than men (P < 0.05). As the education level increased, fewer parents preferred the domestic vaccine for themselves (P = 0.046) and their children (P = 0.005). Both domestic and foreign vaccine acceptability for parents and their children was higher among parents with high anxiety levels regarding COVID-19 infection (P < 0.05). The most common reasons for refusal were anxiety about vaccine side effects, lack of knowledge about the effectiveness of vaccines, and distrust of vaccines originating from abroad. CONCLUSION: Most of the participants were hesitant about COVID-19 vaccines. This study demonstrates that vaccine uptake can be increased by considering the higher preference for domestic vaccines.","Yigit, Metin; Ozkaya-Parlakay, Aslinur; Senel, Emrah",Pediatr. infect. dis. j,363,16

Concern has been aroused regarding a potential harmful effect of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical context. METHODS: Using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of March 28, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 8910 patients with Covid-19 for whom discharge status was available at the time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived to discharge. The factors we found to be independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 10.0%, vs. 4.9% among those &#8804;65 years of age; odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2%, vs. 5.2% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.08 to 3.51), heart failure (15.3%, vs. 5.6% among those without heart failure; odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.79), cardiac arrhythmia (11.5%, vs. 5.6% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2%, vs. 5.6% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.00 to 4.40), and current smoking (9.4%, vs. 5.6% among former smokers or nonsmokers; odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.47). No increased risk of in-hospital death was found to be associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (2.1% vs. 6.1%; odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or the use of ARBs (6.8% vs. 5.7%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.74). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients hospitalized with Covid-19. Our results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in this clinical context.

Neutrophils are professional phagocytes of the innate immune system that are critical in pathogen handling. Neutrophil responses to infection are dysregulated in diabetes, predominantly mediated by persistent hyperglycaemia; the chief biochemical abnormality in T1D and T2D. Therapeutically enhancing host immunity in diabetes to improve infection resolution is an expanding area of research. Individuals with diabetes are also at an increased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), highlighting the need for re-invigorated and urgent focus on this field. The aim of this review is to explore the breadth of previous literature investigating neutrophil function in both T1D and T2D, in order to understand the complex neutrophil phenotype present in this disease and also to focus on the development of new therapies to improve aberrant neutrophil function in diabetes. Existing literature illustrates a dual neutrophil dysfunction in diabetes. Key pathogen handling mechanisms of neutrophil recruitment, chemotaxis, phagocytosis and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are decreased in diabetes, weakening the immune response to infection. However, pro-inflammatory neutrophil pathways, mainly neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, extracellular ROS generation and pro-inflammatory cytokine generation, are significantly upregulated, causing damage to the host and perpetuating inflammation. Reducing these proinflammatory outputs therapeutically is emerging as a credible strategy to improve infection resolution in diabetes, and also more recently COVID-19. Future research needs to drive forward the exploration of novel treatments to improve infection resolution in T1D and T2D to improve patient morbidity and mortality.","Dowey, Rebecca; Iqbal, Ahmed; Heller, Simon R; Sabroe, Ian; Prince, Lynne R",Front Immunol,363,6

The pandemic has been sweeping all continents, North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and South Asia among others at an alarming rapidity. Here, we provide an estimate of the scale of the pandemic spread under different scenarios of variation in key influencing parameters with a hybrid model. Methods: We developed a new hybrid model of infectious disease transmission based on Cellular Automata (CA)-configured SEIR to analyse the COVID-19 outbreak and estimate its transmission pattern. A probabilistic contamination network is embedded in the pandemic transmission model to capture the randomness feature of person-to-person spread of the novel virus. We used the improved SEIR model to quantify the population contact state with isolation measures under different continuous time series contact probability via CA. We adjusted the modelling parameters to verify the model performance in accordance to the data from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. We simulated several scenarios by varying such key parameters as number of isolation rate, average contact times of the population, number of infected people before taking prevention and control measures, medical level and number of imported cases. Results: In the baseline model, we identified that the isolation control as the most influencing factor that had the largest impact on decreasing the speed of the reproductive number, accelerating the arrival of the ""inflection point"" of pandemic prevention and control, and the death rate reduction. We estimated that the probability of people contacts and the number of the onset infected cases before prevention measures also had significant effect on the infection rate reduction with appropriate prevention measures adoption, which partly reflects the impact of timely measure on the severity of the outbreak. We found that imported cases will risk the domestic prevention. Conclusions: Our modelling results clearly indicate that early-stage preventive measures are the most effective way to contain the pandemic spread and a strong interventionist approach needs to be adopted by policymakers vis-à-vis of the highly contagious nature of the COVID-19. Human resources, intensified isolation and confinement as well as special hospital buildings should be prioritised in countries with large number of infections to constrain the global transmission of the virulent infection.

Subsequently, we performed secondary analyses in order to explain the observed results. METHODS: We conducted a matched case-cohort study, based on prospectively collected data from a large ICU cohort in France. Critically ill COVID-19 patients were matched with similar non-COVID-19 patients. ICU-BSI was defined by an infection onset occurring > 48 h after ICU admission. We estimated the effect of COVID-19 on the probability to develop an ICU-BSI using proportional subdistribution hazards models. RESULTS: We identified 321 COVID-19 patients and 1029 eligible controls in 6 ICUs. Finally, 235 COVID-19 patients were matched with 235 non-COVID-19 patients. We observed 43 ICU-BSIs, 35 (14.9%) in the COVID-19 group and 8 (3.4%) in the non-COVID-19 group (p &#8804; 0.0001), respectively. ICU-BSIs of COVID-19 patients were more frequently of unknown source (47.4%). COVID-19 patients had an increased probability to develop ICU-BSI, especially after 7 days of ICU admission. Using proportional subdistribution hazards models, COVID-19 increased the daily risk to develop ICU-BSI (sHR 4.50, 95% CI 1.82-11.16, p = 0.0012). Among COVID-19 patients (n = 235), a significantly increased risk for ICU-BSI was detected in patients who received tocilizumab or anakinra (sHR 3.20, 95% CI 1.31-7.81, p = 0.011) but not corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Using prospectively collected multicentric data, we showed that the ICU-BSI risk was higher for COVID-19 than non-COVID-19 critically ill patients after seven days of ICU stay. Clinicians should be particularly careful on late ICU-BSIs in COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab or anakinra may increase the ICU-BSI risk.","Buetti, Niccolò; Ruckly, Stéphane; de Montmollin, Etienne; Reignier, Jean; Terzi, Nicolas; Cohen, Yves; Siami, Shidasp; Dupuis, Claire; Timsit, Jean-François",Intensive Care Med,363,20

Although several vaccine candidates have shown promising results in clinical trials, resulting in expedited approval for public use from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, recent polls suggest that Americans strongly distrust the vaccine and its approval process. This mistrust stems from both the unusual speed of vaccine development and reports about side effects. This article applies insights from behavioral economics to consider how the general public may make decisions around whether or not to receive a future COVID-19 vaccine in a context of frequent side effects and preexisting mistrust. Three common cognitive biases shown to influence human decision-making under a behavioral economics framework are considered: confirmation bias, negativity bias, and optimism bias. Applying a behavioral economics framework to COVID-19 vaccine decision-making can elucidate potential barriers to vaccine uptake and points of intervention for clinicians and public health professionals.","Saleska, Jessica Londeree; Choi, Kristen R",Transl Behav Med,363,20

The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) administers a voluntary weekly Health Center COVID-19 Survey§ to track health centers' COVID-19 testing capacity and the impact of COVID-19 on operations, patients, and staff. CDC and HRSA analyzed data from the weekly COVID-19 survey completed by 1,009 HRSA-funded health centers (health centers¶) for the week of July 11-17, 2020, to describe telehealth service use in the United States by U.S. Census region,** urbanicity, staffing capacity, change in visit volume, and personal protective equipment (PPE) supply. Among the 1,009 health center respondents, 963 (95.4%) reported providing telehealth services. Health centers in urban areas were more likely to provide >30% of health care visits virtually (i.e., via telehealth) than were health centers in rural areas. Telehealth is a promising approach to promoting access to care and can facilitate public health mitigation strategies and help prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory illnesses, while supporting continuity of care. Although CMS's change of its telehealth provisions enabled health centers to expand telehealth by aligning guidance and leveraging federal resources, sustaining expanded use of telehealth services might require additional policies and resources.","Demeke, Hanna B; Pao, Leah Zilversmit; Clark, Hollie; Romero, Lisa; Neri, Antonio; Shah, Rhea; McDow, Kendra B; Tindall, Erica; Iqbal, Naureen J; Hatfield-Timajchy, Kendra; Bolton, Joshua; Le, Xuan; Hair, Brionna; Campbell, Stephanie; Bui, Cuong; Sandhu, Paramjit; Nwaise, Isaac; Armstrong, Paige A; Rose, Michelle A",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,363,1

The COVID-19 outbreak brought additional concerns and uncertainties once educational systems implemented distance learning schemes for public health management. Nevertheless, higher educational organizations preferred to implement hybrid approaches for student engagement motivation and high dropout rate avoidance. In Romania, such an educational system has been applied with caution. Since the pandemic needs to be understood as an opportunity for adaptation and education improvements, the purpose of the present paper is to uncover lessons learned and to develop a systematized model based on students' perception regarding face-to-face, online and hybrid systems. For this reason, a grounded theory approach has been preferred. Thus, 149 Romanian students enrolled in the first year in engineering specialities with ages between 18-26 years both male (50.3%) and female (49.7%) have answered the research questions in an online environment due to pandemic restrictions. Based on the online asynchronous student interviews, 220 codes and a further 13 categories have been developed. After a pertinent analysis of the relationships between categories and relevant literature sorting, a theoretical model for the Romanian higher educational current pandemic situation has been proposed. The main face-to-face and online education characteristics are outlined, the hybrid approach becoming a bridge between the two systems. Management implications are outlined together with further research directions.","Potra, Sabina; Pugna, Adrian; Pop, Madalin-Dorin; Negrea, Romeo; Dungan, Luisa",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),363,2

Understanding the taxonomic profile of microorganisms in the impacted systems is required to establish taxa that are bio-indicators of toxicants, and provide possible taxa for mitigating ecotoxicity of the HWWs. Geochemistry, pollution status and ecotoxicity of heavy metals (HMs) in HWW-impacted sewer (LU) were assessed. The microbiome profiling was based on 16S rDNA and ITS of 18S rDNA metagenomes. The degree of HMs contamination exceeded 50 and HMs pollution load index of LU was severe (1,084), which consequently exerted severe risk (1,411,575 toxic response factors) with very high toxic responses of Co, Cu, Pb, and Cd. Eco-toxicological impact of the HMs on LU skewed microbiome towards Proteobacteria (43%), Actinobacteria (18%), and about 5% apiece for Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Plantomycetes, and Bacteroidetes. Likewise, the relative abundance of in LU inclined towards Ascomycota (59%), Basidiomycota (17%) and unclassified Eukarya_uc_p (16%). Exclusively found in LU sediments were 44,862 bacterial species and 42,881 fungi taxa, while 72,877 and 53,971 species of bacteria and fungi, respectively, were found missing. Extinction and emergence of bacteria and fungi taxa in LU were in response to HMs ecotoxicity and the need for natural attenuation processes respectively. The profiled taxa in LU may be plausible in bioremediation strategies of the impacted system, and in designing knowledge-based bioreactor system for the treatment of HWWs before discharge into the environment.","Ogwugwa, Vincent Happy; Oyetibo, Ganiyu Oladunjoye; Amund, Olukayode Oladipupo",Environ Res,363,16

The current study revealed that SNHG14 level was high in the serum of AS patients and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced AS cell lines. Besides, we found that SNHG14 accelerated cell proliferation while inhibited cell apoptosis in ox-LDL-induced AS cell lines. Next, SNHG14 was confirmed to be a sponge for miR-186-5p in AS cells, and it was validated that SNHG14 regulated AS cell proliferation and apoptosis by sponging miR-186-5p. Moreover, we uncovered that WAS-interacting protein family member 2 (WIPF2) was a downstream target of miR-186-5p in AS cells. Finally, it was demonstrated that miR-186-5p modulated AS cell proliferation and apoptosis via targeting WIPF2. To conclude, our research disclosed that SNHG14 affected ox-LDL-induced AS cell proliferation and apoptosis through miR-186-5p/WIPF2 axis, which may provide a theoretical basis for the treatment and diagnosis of AS.","Tao, Z; Cao, Z; Wang, X; Pan, D; Jia, Q",Hum Exp Toxicol,363,16

Immunocompetent patients diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and ARDS admitted between March 8 and March 30, 2020, were included and compared with patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS. The primary clinical endpoint of the study was mortality at Day 28. Flow cytometry analyses and serum cytokine measurements were performed at Days 1-2 and 4-6 of ICU admission.Measurements and Main Results: As compared with patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS (n = 36), those with COVID-19 (n = 38) were not significantly different regarding age, sex, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II scores but exhibited a higher Day-28 mortality (34% vs. 11%, P = 0.030).

These face masks are difficult to recycle, and their accumulation contributes to enormous environmental threats. In this study, we hypothesize that the face mask can be reused as long as it retains its original structure, which will slow the environmental impacts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected common disposable surgical masks for this study and classified test conditions based on wear time and reuse method. After wearing the mask for 10 hours, we let it dry naturally in the shade for 14 hours. The specimens were measured by scanning electron microscope and capillary flow porometer. RESULTS: The pore structure of the mask did not change when worn 4 times for 10 hours each time, and there was no significant pore structure change when impregnated with ethyl alcohol (purity 95%), treated with UV or steam, or run through a washing machine. CONCLUSION: The pore structure of the surgical mask was not changed significantly after 40 hours of use.

Empirical data on confirmed cases and deaths, extracted from an open source repository were used to develop the SEAIRD compartment model. Adjustments were made to fit current knowledge on the COVID-19 behavior. The model was implemented and solved using an Ordinary Differential Equation solver and an optimization tool. A cross-validation technique was applied, and the coefficient of determination $R^2$ was computed in order to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the model. %to the data. Key epidemiological parameters were finally estimated and we provided the rationale for the construction of SEAIRD model. When applied to Brazil's cases, SEAIRD produced an excellent agreement to the data, with an %coefficient of determination $R^2$ $\geq 90\%$. The probability of COVID-19 transmission was generally high ($\geq 95\%$). On the basis of a 20-day modeling data, the incidence rate of COVID-19 was as low as 3 infected cases per 100,000 exposed persons in Brazil and France.

We investigated the link between TTE parameters and prognosis in COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to 24 French hospitals were retrospectively included. Comprehensive data, including clinical and biological parameters, were recorded at admission. Focused TTE was performed during hospitalization, according to clinical indication. Patients were followed for a primary composite outcome of death or transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) during hospitalization. Among 2878 patients, 445 (15%) underwent TTE. Most of these had cardiovascular risk factors, a history of cardiovascular disease, and were on cardiovascular treatments. Dilatation and dysfunction were observed in, respectively, 12% (48/412) and 23% (102/442) of patients for the left ventricle, and in 12% (47/407) and 16% (65/402) for the right ventricle (RV). Primary composite outcome occurred in 44% (n = 196) of patients [9% (n = 42) for death without ICU transfer and 35% (n = 154) for admission to ICU]. RV dilatation was the only TTE parameter associated with the primary outcome. After adjustment, male sex [hazard ratio (HR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 - 2.25; P = 0.02], higher body mass index (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.18; P = 0.01), anticoagulation (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 - 0.86; P = 0.01), and RV dilatation (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.05 - 2.64; P = 0.03) remained independently associated with the primary outcome. CONCLUSION: Echocardiographic evaluation of RV dilatation could be useful for assessing risk of severe COVID-19 developing in hospitalized patients.","Soulat-Dufour, Laurie; Fauvel, Charles; Weizman, Orianne; Barbe, Thomas; Pezel, Théo; Mika, Delphine; Cellier, Joffrey; Geneste, Laura; Panagides, Vassili; Marsou, Wassima; Deney, Antoine; Attou, Sabir; Delmotte, Thomas; Ribeyrolles, Sophie; Chemaly, Pascale; Karsenty, Clement; Giordano, Gauthier; Gautier, Alexandre; Duceau, Baptiste; Sutter, Willy; Chaumont, Corentin; Guilleminot, Pierre; Sagnard, Audrey; Pastier, Julie; Trimaille, Antonin; Bonnet, Guillaume; Canu, Marjorie; Coisne, Augustin; Cohen, Ariel",European heart journal.

METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed for articles in English on diabetes and infection. RESULTS: Diabetes predisposes to infections through alterations in innate and acquired immune defenses. Outcomes of infection are worse in people with uncontrolled diabetes, and infection can worsen hyperglycemia in hitherto well controlled diabetes (bidirectional relationship). Diabetes does not increase the risk of infection with COVID-19 per se, but predisposes to severe disease and poor outcomes. COVID-19 has also been linked to deterioration of glycemic control as well as new-onset diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians caring for people with diabetes should be aware of the increased risk of infections in this population, as well as the possibility of worsening hyperglycemia. A holistic approach with frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels and appropriate titration of medications, along with close attention to nutritional status, is essential to ensure the best possible outcomes.","Unnikrishnan, Ranjit; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Metab Syndr,363,1

Therefore, and considering that COVID-19 generally causes damage to the respiratory system (in the form of lung infection), it is essential to ensure the best pulmonary ventilation for the patient. However, depending on the severity of the disease and the health condition of the patient, the situation can become critical when the patient has respiratory distress or becomes unable to breathe on his/her own. In that case, the ventilator becomes the lifeline of the patient. This device must keep patients stable until, on their own or with the help of medications, they manage to overcome the lung infection. However, with thousands or hundreds of thousands of infected patients, no country has enough ventilators. If this situation has become critical in the Global North, it has turned disastrous in developing countries, where ventilators are even more scarce.

Since December 2019, it has been found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spread to the whole country. Some parts of the world also showed an outbreak trend [1-3]. Real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction,RT-PCR) and viral gene sequencing are the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. At present, upper respiratory tract nasopharyngeal swabs are mostly used as nucleic acid detection samples in China, but the positive rate is low. However, there are few reports on clinical application of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in other biological samples. Methods: | The East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University is a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. This observation study included 132 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the infectious disease areas of the East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from 2020.1.31 to 2020.2.29. COVID-19 diagnostic criteria: according to China's âªpneumonia diagnosis and treatment Program of novel coronavirus infection (trial version 7) â«, in accordance with the relevant epidemiological and clinical manifestations, nasopharyngeal swabs real-time fluorescence RT-PCR detection of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive, COVID-19 cases were divided into mild, ordinary, severe and severe [1]. The nasopharyngeal swabs of 132 cases of COVID-19 were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid on admission, including 72 males and 60 females, with an average age of 66.7 ± 9.1 years, including 80 cases of common type, 44 cases of severe type and 8 cases of critical type. During the period of admission, under the condition of tertiary protection, nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, blood, feces and anal swabs of COVID-19 cases were collected many times in the isolation ward for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection. All biological samples are sealed and transferred to the laboratory in strict accordance with the standard process. The RT-PCR test kits (BioGerm) were recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The same technician and brand of test kit was used for all RT-PCR testing reported; both internal controls and negative controls were routinely performed with each batch of tests. Results: | 132 the results of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of various biological samples during the treatment of confirmed COVID-19 cases are as follows: the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of nasopharyngeal swab is 38.13% (180/472 times), the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of sputum is 48.68% (148/304 times), the positive rate of blood 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test is 3.03% (4/132 times), and the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of feces is 9.83% (24/244 times). The positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in anal swabs is 10.00% (12/120 times). Discussion|: In this study, it was found that the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in sputum of 132 patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of nasopharyngeal swabs, and viral nucleic acids were also detected in blood and digestive tract (fecal/anal swabs). Simple detection of nasopharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection positive rate is not high, multi-sample 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection can improve the accuracy, reduce the false negative rate, better guide clinical treatment and evaluate the therapeutic effect.","Wu, Jianguo; Liu, Jiasheng; Li, Shijun; Peng, Zhiyang; Xiao, Zhe; Wang, Xufeng; Yan, Ruicheng; Luo, Jianfei",Travel Med Infect Dis,363,4

The pharmacy profession has a long history of dispensing and compounding, with the addition of clinical roles in the late 20th century. These clinical roles have continued to expand into diverse arenas such as communicable and non-communicable diseases, antimicrobial stewardship, emergency preparedness and response, public health education and health promotion, and critical and emergency care. Pharmacists continue to serve as integral members of interprofessional and interdisciplinary healthcare teams. In this context, CPAs allow pharmacists to expand their roles in patient care and may be considered as a step towards securing provider status. Moving beyond CPAs to a provider status would enable pharmacists to be reimbursed for cognitive services and promote integrated public health delivery models.","Cernasev, Alina; Aruru, Meghana; Clark, Suzanne; Patel, Komal; DiPietro Mager, Natalie; Subramaniam, Vaiyapuri; Truong, Hoai-An",,363,21

It is not known whether the disease is associated with a higher risk of infection in pregnant women or whether intrauterine vertical transmission can occur. We report 2 cases of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19. PATIENT CONCERNS: In all of Yichang city from January 20, 2020, to April 9, 2020, only 2 pregnant women, who were in the late stage of pregnancy, were diagnosed with COVID-19; one patient was admitted for fever with limb asthenia, and the other patient was admitted for abnormal chest computed tomography results. DIAGNOSES: Both pregnant women were diagnosed with COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: After the medical staff prepared for isolation and protection, the 2 pregnant women quickly underwent cesarean sections. A series of tests, such as laboratory, imaging, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid examinations, were performed on the 2 women with COVID-19 and their newborns. OUTCOMES: One of the 2 infected pregnant women had severe COVID-19, and the other had mild disease. Both babies were delivered by cesarean section. Both of the women with COVID-19 worsened 3 to 6 days after delivery. Chest computed tomography suggested that the lesions due to SARS-CoV-2 infection increased. These women began to exhibit fever or reduced blood oxygen saturation again. One of the 2 newborns was born prematurely, and the other was born at full term. Neither infant was infected with COVID-19, but both had increased prothrombin time and fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphocreatine kinase, and creatine kinase isoenzyme contents. LESSONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was not found in the newborns born to the 2 pregnant women with COVID-19, but transient coagulation dysfunction and myocardial damage occurred in the 2 newborns. Effective management strategies for pregnant women with COVID-19 will help to control the outbreak of COVID-19 among pregnant women.","Zheng, Tingting; Guo, Jianqiang; He, Wencong; Wang, Hao; Yu, Huiling; Ye, Hong",Medicine (Baltimore),363,22

Natural ventilation efficiency was checked in two different ventilation scenarios: only windows open and windows and doors open. The results show how ventilation affects the temperature, CO2 concentration, and median particle diameter size parameters. By contrast, the relative humidity depends more on the outdoor meteorological conditions. Both ventilation scenarios tend to create the same room conditions in terms of temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, and particle size. Additionally, the evolution of CO2 concentration as well as the particle size distribution along the time was studied.

Correlations between PFT and residual radiologic anomalies at three months taking into account initial clinical and radiological severity and steroid use during acute phase. RESULTS: 137 patients (69 men, median age 59 (Q1 50; Q3 68), BMI 27.5 kg/m2 (25.1; 31.7)) were assessed. Only 32.9% had normal PFT, 75 had altered DLCO. Median (Q1; Q3) values were: VC 79 (66; 92) % pred, FEV1 81 (68; 89), TLC 78 (67; 85), DLCO 60 (44; 72), and KCO 89 (77; 105). Ground glass opacities (GGO) were present in 103 patients (75%), reticulations in 42 (30%), and fibrosis in 18 (13%). There were significantly lower FEV1 (p = 0.0089), FVC (p = 0.0010), TLC (p < 0.0001) and DLCO (p < 0.0001) for patients with GGO, lower TLC (p = 0.0913) and DLCO (p = 0.0181) between patients with reticulations and lower FVC (p = 0.0618), TLC (p = 0.0742) DLCO (p = 0.002) and KCO (p = 0.0114) between patients with fibrosis. Patients with initial &#8805;50% lung involvement had significantly lower FEV1 (p = 0.0019), FVC (p = 0.0033), TLC (p = 0.0028) and DLCO (p = 0.0003) compared to patients with &#8804;10%. There was no difference in PFT and residual CT lesions between patients who received steroids and those who did not. CONCLUSION: The majority of patients have altered PFT at three months, even in patients with mild initial disease, with significantly lower function in patients with residual CT lesions. Steroids do not seem to modify functional and radiological recovery. Long-term follow-up is needed.","Frija-Masson, Justine; Debray, Marie-Pierre; Boussouar, Samia; Khalil, Antoine; Bancal, Catherine; Motiejunaite, Justina; Galarza-Jimenez, Maria Alejandra; Benzaquen, Hélène; Penaud, Dominique; Laveneziana, Pierantonio; Malrin, Roxane; Redheuil, Alban; Donciu, Victoria; Lucidarme, Olivier; Taillé, Camille; Guerder, Antoine; Arnoult, Florence; Vidal-Petiot, Emmanuelle; Flamant, Martin; Similowski, Thomas; Morelot-Panzini, Capucine; Faure, Morgane; Lescure, François-Xavier; Straus, Christian; d039,; Ortho, Marie-Pia; Gonzalez-Bermejo, Jésus",Respir Med,363,6

Our main objective was to identify miRNAs involved in the endothelial function and determine their expression in post-mortem lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory injuries and thrombotic events. Based on functional enrichment analysis, miR-26a-5p, miR-29b-3p, and miR-34a-5p were identified as regulators of mRNA targets involved in endothelial, and inflammatory signaling pathways as well as in viral diseases. A miRNA/mRNA network, constructed based on protein-protein interactions of the miRNA targets and the inflammatory biomarkers characterized in the patients, revealed a close interconnection of these miRNAs with relevance to the endothelial activation/dysfunction. Reduced expression levels of selected miRNAs were observed in the lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients (n=9) compared to the Controls (n=10)(P<0.01-0.0001). MiR-26a-5p and miR-29b-3p presented the best power to discriminate these groups (AUC=0.8286, and AUC=0.8125, respectively). The correlation analysis of the miRNAs with inflammatory biomarkers in the COVID-19 patients was significant for miR-26a-5p [IL-6 (r2=0.5414), and ICAM-1(r2=0.5624)], and miR-29b-3p [IL-4 (r2=0.8332), and IL-8 (r2=0.2654)]. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the relevance and the non-random involvement of miR-26a-5p, miR-29b-3p, and miR-34a-5p in endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the occurrence of severe lung injury and immunothrombosis.","Centa, Ariana; Fonseca, Aline S; Ferreira, Solange G da Silva; Azevedo, Marina Luise V; Vaz de Paula, Caroline B; Nagashima, Seigo; Machado-Souza, Cleber; Miggiolaro, Anna Flavia R Dos Santos; Baena, Cristina P; de Noronha, Lucia; Cavalli, Luciane R","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",363,25

We sought to understand the ways in which COVID-19 prompted changes in clinical practices in abortion care among independent abortion clinics. Study design: We surveyed independent US abortion clinics and documented changes in practice regarding the provision of abortion since March 1, 2020. Results: Among about 153 independent clinics invited, 100 clinics contributed relevant data and were included in the analytic sample. A total of 87% reported changes in protocols in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reported changes included moving to telehealth (phone or video) for follow-up (71%), starting or increasing telehealth for patient consultations and screening (41%), reducing Rh testing (43%) and other tests (42%), and omitting the preabortion ultrasound (15%). A total of 20% reported allowing quick pickup of medication abortion pills, and 4% began mailing medications directly to patients after a telehealth consultation. Clinical practice changes were reported throughout all regions of the US, but facilities in the Northeast (73%) were more likely to report starting or increasing telehealth than facilities in the South (23%, pâ¯<â¯.001). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated use of telehealth among independent abortion clinics, but many clinics, particularly those in the South, have been unable to make these changes. Other practices such as reducing preabortion ultrasounds were less common in all regions despite clinical guidelines and evidence supporting such changes in practice and positive benefits for public health and patient-centered care. Implications: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a window of opportunity to remove barriers to abortion, including expanding telehealth and reducing preabortion tests. Clinics can strive for a culture shift towards simplifying the provision of medication abortion and routinely avoiding preabortion tests and in-person visits. Such changes in practice could have positive benefits for public health and patient-centered care.","Upadhyay, Ushma D; Schroeder, Rosalyn; Roberts, Sarah C M",Contracept X,363,1
519528,519528,519528,Responding to coronavirus disease 2019: LA County hospital experience,16.819252,12.393268,2020,"BACKGROUND: Early life adversity associates with poor sleep in adulthood and is believed to sensitize individuals to later stressors. Infectious disease outbreaks increase psychological stress, and life events impact sleep quality. American Indians have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Investigate whether childhood trauma predicts changes in sleep quality following onset of the pandemic and test whether pandemic stress contributes to changes in sleep. METHODS: In a sample of 210 American Indian adults (Age M (SD) = 55.09 (13.10), 59.5% female) demographics, childhood trauma and sleep quality were measured at Time 1. One month following the onset of the pandemic, psychological stress specific to the pandemic and sleep quality were measured. RESULTS: Using linear regression controlling for age, sex, income, and sleep quality at Time 1, childhood adversity predicted both psychological stress specific to the pandemic and changes in sleep quality from Time 1 to Time 2 (ß = 0.33, t(205) = 4.88, P < .001, &#916;R2 = 0.10) and (ß = 0.24, t(204) = 3.48, P < .001, &#916;R2 = 0.05), respectively. Mediation analyses indicated a significant indirect effect between childhood adversity and changes in sleep quality through COVID-19 stress (indirect effect [standard error, SE] = (0.03[0.01], 95% confidence interval = [0.003, 0.03]). CONCLUSIONS: In American Indians childhood trauma predicts greater declines in sleep quality associated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in part because greater psychological stress related to COVID-19. Future work should identify factors which alleviate stress related to life events for individuals who experienced childhood trauma in order to improve health behaviors and health.","John-Henderson, Neha A",Sleep Health,363,1

Hospital occupancy rates and medical expenses increase dramatically. Real-time remote health monitoring and surveillance systems with IoT assisted eHealth equipment play important roles in such pandemic situations. To prevent the spread of a pandemic is as crucial as treating the infected patients. The COVID-19 pandemic is the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We propose a surveillance system especially for coronavirus pandemic with IoT applications and an inter-WBAN geographic routing algorithm. In this study, coronavirus symptoms such as respiration rate, body temperature, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate can be monitored and the social distance with 'mask-wearing status' of persons can be displayed with proposed IoT software (Node-RED, InfluxDB, and Grafana). RESULTS: The geographic routing algorithm is compared with AODV in outdoor areas according to delivery ratio, delay for priority node, packet loss ratio and bit error rate. The results obtained showed that the geographic routing algorithm is more successful for the proposed architecture.

Interferon beta1 has shown in vitro studies a potent inhibition of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In an in vitro study, SARS-CoV-2 had more sensitivity to IFN-I pretreatment that SARS-CoV. A combination of IFN beta1b administered subcutaneously with other antiviral treatments has been recommended in several guidelines. However, clinical trial results for the treatment of COVID-19 are pending. We aimed to assess the efficiency of IFN beta1b in COVID19 comparing the in-hospital mortality between patients who received IFN beta1b and patients did not receive. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we included hospitalized adults with COVID-19 between February 23th and April 4th, 2020, at the Central Defense Hospital (Madrid, Spain). Subcutaneous interferon beta-1b was recommended in moderate-severe pneumonia. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify variables associated with in-hospital mortality. Findings We analyzed 256 patients (106 patients in interferon group and 150 patients in control group). At admission, patients who did not receive interferon beta1b presented a greater number of comorbidities. The overall mortality rate was 24.6% (63/256). Twenty-two patients (20.8%) in the interferon group died and 41 (27.3%) in the control group (p=0.229). In the multivariate analysis, the predictors of in-hospital mortality were age, severity of clinical picture at admission and hydroxychloroquine treatment. Interpretation In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, interferon beta1b treatment was not associated to decrease in-hospital mortality. Further assessment of the earlier administration of this drug in randomized trials is recommended.","Estebanez, M.; Martinez-Oliveira, G.; Mata, T.; Marti, D.; Gutierrez, C.; De Dios, B.; Dolores Herrero, M.; Roel, A.; Martinez, Y.; Aguirre, A.; Alcantara Nicolas, F.; Fernandez Gonzalez, P.; Lopez, E.; Ballester, L.

We aim to describe the determinants of treatment plan changes from the perspective of oncology physicians across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were recruited to an anonymous cross-sectional online survey of oncology physicians (surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists) using social media from March 27 to April 10, 2020. Physician demographics, practice characteristics, and cancer treatment decisions were collected. RESULTS: The analytic cohort included 411 physicians: 241 (58.6%) surgeons, 106 (25.8%) medical oncologists, and 64 (15.6%) radiation oncologists. In all, 38.0% were practicing in states with 1001 to 5000 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of April 3, 2020, and 37.2% were in states with >5000 cases. Most physicians (N=285; 70.0% of surgeons, 64.4% of medical oncologists, and 73.4% of radiation oncologists) had altered cancer treatment plans. Most respondents were concerned about their patients’ COVID-19 exposure risks, but this was the primary driver for treatment alterations only for medical oncologists. For surgeons, the primary driver for treatment alterations was conservation of personal protective equipment, institutional mandates, and external society recommendations. Radiation oncologists were primarily driven by operational changes such as visitor restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a majority of oncologists to alter their treatment plans, but the primary motivators for changes differed by oncologic specialty. This has implications for reinstitution of standard cancer treatment, which may occur at differing time points by treatment modality.","Hui, Jane Yuet Ching; Yuan, Jianling; Teoh, Deanna; Thomaier, Lauren; Jewett, Patricia; Beckwith, Heather; Parsons, Helen; Lou, Emil; Blaes, Anne H.; Vogel, Rachel I.",Am J Clin Oncol,363,30

Among these, there are two sharply different types of the system organization—Ca(2+)-regulated photoproteins and luciferases themselves that function in accordance with the classical enzyme–substrate kinetics. Along with deep and comprehensive fundamental research on these systems, approaches and methods of their practical use as highly sensitive reporters in analytics have been developed. The research aiming at the creation of artificial luciferases and synthetic CTZ analogues with new unique properties has led to the development of new experimental analytical methods based on them.

Therefore, the present study aims to explore the possibilities offered by naturally available and abundant flavonoid compounds, as a prospective antiviral drug to combat the virus. A library of 44 citrus flavonoids was screened against the highly conserved Main Protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 using molecular docking. The compounds which showed better CDocker energy than the co-crystal inhibitor of M(pro) were further revalidated by flexible docking within the active site; followed by assessment of drug likeness and toxicity parameters. The non-toxic compounds were further subjected to molecular dynamics simulation and predicted activity (IC(50)) using 3D-QSAR analysis. Subsequently, hydrogen bonds and dehydration analysis of the best compound were performed to assess the binding affinity to M(pro). It was observed that out of the 44 citrus flavonoids, five compounds showed lower binding energy with M(pro) than the co-crystal ligand. Moreover, these compounds also formed H-bonds with two important catalytic residues His41 and Cys145 of the active sites of M(pro). Three compounds which passed the drug likeness filter showed stable conformation during MD simulations. Among these, the lowest predicted IC(50) value was observed for Taxifolin. Therefore, this study suggests that Taxifolin, could be a potential inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 main protease and can be further analysed by in vitro and in vivo experiments for management of the ongoing pandemic.

The peak in CPV infection rates occurs during the summer months of May and June, marking a distinct “CPV season”. We hypothesized that human activity contributes to these seasonal changes in CPV infections. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in drastic changes in human behavior which happened to synchronize with the CPV season in Central Texas, providing a unique opportunity with which to assess whether these society-level behavioral changes result in appreciable changes in CPV patient populations in the largest CPV treatment facility in Texas. In this work, we examine the population of CPV-infected patients at a large, dedicated CPV treatment clinic in Texas (having treated more than 5000 CPV-positive dogs in the last decade) and demonstrate that societal–behavioral changes due to COVID-19 were associated with a drastic reduction in CPV infections. This reduction occurred precisely when CPV season would typically begin, during the period immediately following state-wide “reopening” of business and facilities, resulting in a change in the typical CPV season when compared with previous years. These results provide evidence that changes in human activity may, in some way, contribute to changes in rates of CPV infection in the Central Texas region.","Horecka, Kevin; Ratnayaka, Nipuni; Davis, Elizabeth A.",Viruses,363,22

We performed an outbreak investigation using advanced genomic and statistical techniques to reconstruct likely transmission chains and assess the role of healthcare workers (HCWs) in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: We investigated a nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a university-affiliated rehabilitation clinic, involving patients and HCWs, with high coverage of pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS). We estimated the time-varying reproduction number from epidemiological data (Rt) and produced a maximum likelihood phylogeny to assess genetic diversity of the pathogen. We combined genomic and epidemiological data into a Bayesian framework to model directionality of transmission. We performed a Case-control study to investigate risk factors for nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 acquisition in patients. FINDINGS: The outbreak spanned from March 14 to April 12, 2020 and involved 37 patients (31 with WGS) and 39 employees (31 with WGS) of whom 37 are HCWs. We estimated a peak R(t) between 2.2 – 3.6. The phylogenetic tree showed very limited genetic diversity, with 60/62 (96.7%) isolates forming one large cluster of identical genomes. Despite the resulting uncertainty in reconstructed transmission events, our analyses suggest that HCWs (one of whom was the index Case) played an essential role in cross-transmission, with a significantly larger fraction of infections (p < 2.2e-16) attributable to HCWs (70.7%) than expected given the number of HCWs cases (46.7%). The excess of transmission from HCWs was larger when considering infection of patients (79.0%; 95%CI 78.5% - 79.5%), and especially frail patients (Clinical Frailty Scale >5: 82.3%; 95%CI 81.8% - 83.4%). Furthermore, frail patients were found to be at greater risk for nosocomial COVID-19 than other patients (adjusted OR 6.94; 95%CI 2.13 – 22.57). INTERPRETATION: This outbreak report highlights the essential role of HCWs in SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in healthcare settings. Limited genetic diversity in pathogen genomes hampered the reconstruction of individual transmission events, resulting in substantial uncertainty in who infected whom. However, our study shows that despite such uncertainty, significant transmission patterns can be observed.","Abbas, Mohamed; Nunes, Tomás Robalo; Cori, Anne; Cordey, Samuel; Laubscher, Florian; Baggio, Stephanie; Jombart, Thibaut; Iten, Anne; Vieux, Laure; Teixeira, Daniel; Perez, Monica; Pittet, Didier; Frangos, Emilia; Graf, Christophe E.; Zingg, Walter; Harbarth, Stephan",J Hosp Infect,363,0

Macroalgae play a special role in the pursuit of new active molecules as they have been traditionally consumed and are known for their chemical and nutritional composition and their biological properties, including antimicrobial activity. Among the bioactive molecules of algae, proteins and peptides, polysaccharides, polyphenols, polyunsaturated fatty acids and pigments can be highlighted. However, for the complete obtaining and incorporation of these molecules, it is essential to achieve easy, profitable and sustainable recovery of these compounds. For this purpose, novel liquid–liquid and solid–liquid extraction techniques have been studied, such as supercritical, ultrasound, microwave, enzymatic, high pressure, accelerated solvent and intensity pulsed electric fields extraction techniques. Moreover, different applications have been proposed for these compounds, such as preservatives in the food or cosmetic industries, as antibiotics in the pharmaceutical industry, as antibiofilm, antifouling, coating in active packaging, prebiotics or in nanoparticles. This review presents the main antimicrobial potential of macroalgae, their specific bioactive compounds and novel green extraction technologies to efficiently extract them, with emphasis on the antibacterial and antifungal data and their applications.","Silva, Aurora; Silva, Sofia A.; Carpena, M.; Garcia-Oliveira, P.; Gullón, P.; Barroso, M.

In this article, we look at the anxiety problems that some parents and their children might experience when school reopens after the COVID-19 lockdown. Using a behavioral theory of development, we provide suggestions for how to handle the departure and separation problems that may emerge as parents drop their children off at school. Many parents are unsure about how to handle anxiety or fear as their children return to school or have to visit other environments outside their homes. Social distancing has caused families to develop stronger dependencies at home and to create new routines that vary, in many instances greatly, from their prepandemic routines. Families are adjusting to the new “normal.” They are keeping their children busy with schoolwork as best they can. In particular, families have likely developed close attachment relationships. Families have been struggling with an unprecedented lockdown, and for many parents and their children, this extended period of family confinement and severe restrictions has been especially stressful, and the timing for returning to school is uncertain. We emphasize here that parents can be responsive to their children’s needs, plan ahead, provide reassurance, and depart firmly without vacillating, and we provide other tips to avoid inadvertently shaping children’s negative or anxiety behaviors as they go back to school. We offer some specific advice for parents and teachers to follow to prevent the departure and separation problems that typically develop during challenging behavioral interactions in school settings.","Pelaez, Martha; Novak, Gary",Behav Anal Pract,363,20

This study aimed to investigate the impact of prioritizing available doses on the basis of recipient antibody status, that is by exposure status, using Qatar as an example. Methods: Vaccination impact was assessed under different scale-up scenarios using a deterministic meta-population mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression in the presence of vaccination. Results: For a vaccine that protects against infection with an efficacy of 95%, half as many vaccinations were needed to avert one infection, disease outcome, or death by prioritizing antibody-negative individuals for vaccination. Prioritization by antibody status reduced incidence at a faster rate and led to faster elimination of infection and return to normalcy. Further prioritization by age group amplified the gains of prioritization by antibody status. Gains from prioritization by antibody status were largest in settings where the proportion of the population already infected at the commencement of vaccination was 30-60%, which is perhaps where most countries will be by the time vaccination programs are up and running. For a vaccine that only protects against disease and not infection, vaccine impact was reduced by half, whether this impact was measured in terms of averted infections or disease outcomes, but the relative gains from using antibody status to prioritize vaccination recipients were similar. Conclusions: Major health, societal, and economic gains can be achieved more quickly by prioritizing those who are antibody-negative while doses of the vaccine remain in short supply.","Ayoub, H.

This study aimed to analyze the emotional type and intensity in tweets on toothache posted during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using the Twitter Search API, we collected tweets in English associated with the keywords “Corona, Toothache” “Corona, Tooth, Pain” “Corona, Dental Pain” “Covid-19, Toothache” “Covid-19, Tooth, Pain” and “Covid-19, Dental Pain” posted between March 11, 2020 and June 30, 2020 all around the world. After the relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, 426 posts were selected and analyzed using the CrystalFeel algorithm, a sensitivity analytical technology with proven accuracy. The chi-square test (SPSS v23, IBM) was used to compare emotions and emotional intensities according to the words used. RESULTS: It was determined that 80.3% of the participants experienced fear and 61.7% had a negative emotional intensity. There was no statistically significant difference between the distributions of emotions according to the words without time distinction (p = 0.136). There was a statistically significant difference between the distributions of emotional intensity according to the words without time distinction (p = 0.006).

Statins, in particular, were chosen for their anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of our work was to evaluate the role of statin therapy in a cohort of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, trying to understand whether such drugs were able to improve the patients’ outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 501 adult inpatients admitted to the two COVID-hospitals of Ferrara’s territory, dividing them into two groups: ST=patients (on statin therapy on admission) and NST=patients (not on statin therapy). We searched for differences between groups in terms of anamnestic, clinical and laboratory data and then of disease outcomes. Results: We found significant differences between groups in terms of age, comorbidities, procalcitonin and CPK serum levels: ST patients were older, more comorbid, with lower procalcitonin and higher CPK serum levels. Male gender was the only independent predictor of needing intensification of care, while age and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were good predictors of in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Differences were also found in the survival functions between the groups. Conclusions: After a period of observation of 100 days, ST patients, despite their older age and their greater load of comorbidities, have similar survival functions to NST patients. Adjusted for age and CCI, the survival functions of the ST group are considerably more favorable than those of the second group.","Greco, S.; Luciani, F.; Giorgini, E.; D'Amuri, A.; Lopreiato, M.; Fortunato, V.; Scopa, A.; Vestita, G.; Capatti, E.; Passaro, A.",Atherosclerosis,363,20

METHODS: This retrospective review included 499 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia between February 11 and March 8, 2020. Subgroups sharing the CT features were identified using LCA. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to analyze the association between clinical types and the LCA-derived subgroups. RESULTS: Two radiological subgroups were identified using LCA. There were 228 subjects (45.69%) in class 1 and 271 subjects (54.31%) in class 2. The CT findings of class 1 were smaller pulmonary infection volume, more peripheral distribution, more GGO, more maximum lesion range ≤ 5 cm, a smaller number of lesions, less involvement of lobes, less air bronchogram, less dilatation of vessels, less hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement, and less pleural effusion than the CT findings of class 2. Univariate analysis demonstrated that older age, therapy, presence of fever, presence of hypertension, decreased lymphocyte count, and increased CRP levels were significant parameters associated with an increased risk for class 2. Multivariate analyses revealed that the patients with clinically severe type disease had a 1.97-fold risk of class 2 than the patients with clinically moderate-type disease. CONCLUSIONS: The demographic and clinical differences between the two radiological subgroups based on the LCA were significantly different. Two radiological subgroups were significantly associated with clinical moderate and severe types. KEY POINTS: • Two radiological subgroups were identified using LCA. • Older age, therapy, presence of fever, presence of hypertension, decreased lymphocyte count, and increased CRP levels were significant parameters with an increased risk for class 2 defined by LCA. • Patients with clinically severe type had a 1.97-fold higher risk of class 2 defined by LCA in comparison with patients showing clinically moderate-type disease.","Fang, Xu; Li, Xiao; Bian, Yun; Ji, Xiang; Lu, Jianping",Eur Radiol,363,9

The vision was to improve team working out of hours, expedite review of sick patients and reorganise care to seek a reduction in bleeps to medical junior doctors overnight in a way that all patients had access to the right person with the right skills for their needs at the right time. The hospital at night project at our hospital was started in 2019 by a multidisciplinary working group.

After transitioning the cat to a higher sodium diet and instituting several enrichment changes to the cat’s environment, average water consumption and urine output levels decreased to almost normal levels and USG increased from 1.006 to 1.022. These findings provide strong evidence that primary polydipsia was the underlying etiology of the cat’s condition.

The aim of this study is to measure the efficiency and tolerance of prone positioning in ward hypoxemic patients treated for Covid-19. This retrospective study included confirmed Covid-19 hypoxemic patients treated by at least one prone position session. Primary outcome was pulse oximetry over inspired oxygen fraction ratio (SpO(2)/FiO(2)) before, during, and after prone position. Secondary outcomes were failure, adverse events, and poor tolerance rate. Twenty-seven patients were included. During first, second and third sessions, SpO(2)/FiO(2) ratio was significantly higher during posture than before (p < 0.0001, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001 respectively). Eighteen patients were responders (defined as an improvement of SpO(2)/FiO(2) of more than 50) during the first posture and have a shorter length of hospital stay than non-responder patients. Failure rate was 5%, and poor tolerance and adverse events rates were 8% and 7% respectively. Our study found that prone position in wards improved alveolar exchange during posture and is well tolerated. This technique could be used in any medical ward.","Wormser, Johan; Romanet, Christophe; Philippart, François",Ir J Med Sci,363,29

Short stretches of homologous host–pathogen sequences (SSHHPS) can be found spanning the viral protease cleavage sites. We hypothesized that these sequences corresponded to specific host protein targets since >40 host proteins have been shown to be cleaved by Group IV viral proteases and one Group VI viral protease. Using PHI-BLAST and the viral protease cleavage site sequences, we searched the human proteome for host targets and analyzed the hit results. Although the polyprotein and host proteins related to the suppression of the innate immune responses may be the primary targets of these viral proteases, we identified other cleavable host proteins. These proteins appear to be related to the virus-induced phenotype associated with Group IV viruses, suggesting that information about viral pathogenesis may be extractable directly from the viral genome sequence. Here we identify sequences cleaved by the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) in vitro within human MYH7 and MYH6 (two cardiac myosins linked to several cardiomyopathies), FOXP3 (an X-linked T(reg) cell transcription factor), ErbB4 (HER4), and vitamin-K-dependent plasma protein S (PROS1), an anticoagulation protein that prevents blood clots. Zinc inhibited the cleavage of these host sequences in vitro. Other patterns emerged from multispecies sequence alignments of the cleavage sites, which may have implications for the selection of animal models and zoonosis. SSHHPS/nsP is an example of a sequence-specific post-translational silencing mechanism.","Reynolds, Nathanael D.; Aceves, Nathalie M.; Liu, Jinny L.; Compton, Jaimee R.; Leary, Dagmar H.; Freitas, Brendan T.; Pegan, Scott D.; Doctor, Katarina Z.; Wu, Fred Y.; Hu, Xin; Legler, Patricia M.",ACS Infect Dis,363,1

With some notable exceptions, safe and effective vaccines, which are now being widely distributed globally, have largely begun to stabilise the situation. However, emerging variants of concern and vaccine hesitancy are apparent obstacles to eradication. Therefore, the need for the development of potent antivirals is still of importance. In this context, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) is a critical target and numerous clinical trials, predominantly in the private domain, are currently in progress. Here, our aim was to extend our previous studies, with hypericin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, as potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). Firstly, we performed all-atom microsecond molecular dynamics simulations, which highlight the stability of the ligands in the M(pro) active site over the duration of the trajectories. We also invoked PELE Monte Carlo simulations which indicate that both hypericin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside preferentially interact with the M(pro) active site and known allosteric sites. For further validation, we performed an in vitro enzymatic activity assay that demonstrated that hypericin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside inhibit M(pro) activity in a dose-dependent manner at biologically relevant (μM) concentrations. However, both ligands are much less potent than the well-known covalent antiviral GC376, which was used as a positive control in our experiments. Nevertheless, the biologically relevant activity of hypericin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside is encouraging. In particular, a synthetic version of hypericin has FDA orphan drug designation, which could simplify potential clinical evaluation in the context of COVID-19.","Liang, Julia; Pitsillou, Eleni; Ververis, Katherine; Guallar, Victor; Hung, Andrew; Karagiannis, Tom C.",J Mol Graph Model,363,13

Normal exons are generally targeted to restore the dystrophin reading frame however, an appreciable subset of dystrophin mutations are intra-exonic and therefore have the potential to compromise oligomer efficiency, necessitating personalised oligomer design for some patients. Although antisense oligomers are easily personalised, it remains unclear whether all patient polymorphisms within antisense oligomer target sequences will require the costly process of producing and validating patient specific compounds. METHODS: Here we report preclinical testing of a panel of splice switching antisense oligomers, designed to excise exon 25 from the dystrophin transcript, in normal and dystrophic patient cells. These patient cells harbour a single base insertion in exon 25 that lies within the target sequence of an oligomer shown to be effective at removing exon 25. RESULTS: It was anticipated that such a mutation would compromise oligomer binding and efficiency. However, we show that, despite the mismatch an oligomer, designed and optimised to excise exon 25 from the normal dystrophin mRNA, removes the mutated exon 25 more efficiently than the mutation-specific oligomer. CONCLUSION: This raises the possibility that mismatched AOs could still be therapeutically applicable in some cases, negating the necessity to produce patient-specific compounds.","Fragall, Clayton T; Adams, Abbie M; Johnsen, Russell D; Kole, Ryszard; Fletcher, Sue; Wilton, Steve D",BMC Med Genet,363,20

Subject to country-specific variability, it is projected that with current mitigation measures in place, the peak incidence of active COVID-19 infections may be delayed by over 6 months. Although this aims to prevent the overburdening of healthcare systems, prolonged deferral of elective endoscopy will become unsustainable. Herein, we propose that by incorporating readily available point-of-care tests and conducting accurate clinical risk assessments, a safe and timely return to elective endoscopy is feasible. Our algorithm not only focuses on the safety of patients and healthcare workers, but also assists in rationalizing the use of invaluable resources such as personal protective equipment.","Gupta, Sunil; Shahidi, Neal; Gilroy, Nicole; Rex, Douglas K.; Burgess, Nicholas G.; Bourke, Michael J.",Gastrointest Endosc,363,16

In MCS systems, a crowd supplies sensing information for monitoring phenomena through mobile devices. Depending on the degree of involvement of users, MCS systems can be participatory, opportunistic or hybrid, which combines strengths of above approaches. Typically, a large number of participants is required to make a sensing campaign successful which makes impractical to build and deploy large testbeds to assess the performance of MCS phases like data collection, user recruitment, and evaluating the quality of information. Simulations offer a valid alternative. In this paper, we focus on hybrid MCS and extend CrowdSenSim 2.0 in order to support such systems. Specifically, we propose an algorithm for efficient re-route users that would offer opportunistic contribution towards the location of sensitive MCS tasks that require participatory-type of sensing contribution. We implement such design in CrowdSenSim 2.0, which by itself extends the original CrowdSenSim by featuring a stateful approach to support algorithms where the chronological order of events matters, extensions of the architectural modules, including an additional system to model urban environments, code refactoring, and parallel execution of algorithms.","Montori, Federico; Bedogni, Luca; Fiandrino, Claudio; Capponi, Andrea; Bononi, Luciano",Comput Commun,363,20

This disease is characterized by simultaneous or sequential organ and system involvement, with unpredictable flare and high levels of morbidity and mortality. Racial/ethnic background, socioeconomic status, cost of medications, difficulty accessing health care, and poor adherence seem to impact lupus outcomes and treatment response. In this article, the management of cSLE patients is updated. Regarding pathogenesis, a number of potential targets for drugs have been studied. However, most treatments in pediatric patients are off-label drugs with recommendations based on inadequately powered studies, therapeutic consensus guidelines, or case series. Management practices for cSLE patients include evaluations of disease activity and cumulative damage scores, routine non-live vaccinations, physical activity, and addressing mental health issues. Antimalarials and glucocorticoids are still the most common drugs used to treat cSLE, and hydroxychloroquine is recommended for nearly all cSLE patients. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) should be standardized for each patient, based on disease flare and cSLE severity. Mycophenolate mofetil or intravenous cyclophosphamide is suggested as induction therapy for lupus nephritis classes III and IV. Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, voclosporin) appear to be another good option for cSLE patients with lupus nephritis. Regarding B-cell-targeting biologic agents, rituximab may be used for refractory lupus nephritis patients in combination with another DMARD, and belimumab was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for cSLE treatment in children aged > 5 years. New therapies targeting CD20, such as atacicept and telitacicept, seem to be promising drugs for SLE patients. Anti-interferon therapies (sifalimumab and anifrolumab) have shown beneficial results in phase II randomized control trials in adult SLE patients, as have some Janus kinase inhibitors, and these could be alternative treatments for pediatric patients with severe interferon-mediated inflammatory disease in the future. In addition, strict control of proteinuria and blood pressure is required in cSLE, especially with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker use.","Trindade, Vitor Cavalcanti; Carneiro-Sampaio, Magda; Bonfa, Eloisa; Silva, Clovis Artur",Paediatr Drugs,363,1

Early clinical reports of successful HCQ‐associated reduction in viral load from small studies in COVID‐19 patients spurred a large number of national and international clinical trials to test their therapeutic potential. The objective of this review is to summarize the current evidence on the safety and efficacy of these two agents and to provide a perspective on why their repurposing has hitherto failed. METHODS: Published studies and rapidly emerging data were reviewed to gather evidence on safety and efficacy of CQ and HCQ in patients with COVID‐19 infection or as prophylaxis. The focus is on clinically relevant efficacy endpoints and their adverse effects on QT interval. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: At the doses used, the two agents, given alone or with azithromycin (AZM), are not effective in COVID‐19 infection. The choice of (typically subtherapeutic) dosing regimens, influenced partly by ""QT‐phobia,"" varied widely and seems anecdotal without any pharmacologically reliable supporting clinical evidence. A substantial proportion of patients receiving CQ/HCQ/AZM regimen developed QTc interval prolongation, many with absolute QTc interval exceeding the potential proarrhythmic threshold, but very few developed proarrhythmia. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The strategy to repurpose CQ/HCQ to combat COVID‐19 infection is overshadowed by concerns about their QT liability, resulting in choice of potentially subtherapeutic doses. Although the risk of QT‐related proarrhythmia is real, it is low and manageable by careful monitoring. Recent discontinuation of HCQ from at least four large studies effectively marks the end of efforts at repurposing of CQ or HCQ for COVID‐19 infection. This episode leaves behind important questions on dose selection and risk/benefit balance in repurposing drugs generally.","Shah, Rashmi R.",J Clin Pharm Ther,363,11

OBJECTIVES: To study how COVID-19 affected cancer deaths regarding age, sex, socio-economic status, comorbidities, and access to palliative care. An additional objective was to study changes in place of care and death. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective study of all cancer patients who died during March-May 2020 in the Stockholm region, n = 1467 of which 278 died with a COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with deaths in 2016-2019. The Stockholm Regional Council's central data warehouse was used. T-tests, 95% CI, Wilcoxon and chi-squared tests were used for comparisons. RESULTS: There were excess cancer deaths compared with 2016-2019 (p < 0.001) and patients dying with a COVID-19 diagnosis were older (79.7 vs. 75.9 years, p < 0.0001), more often male (67% vs. 55%, p < 0.0001), and had more comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index 1.6 vs. 1.1, p < 0.0001). Patients with COVID-19 more seldom had access to palliative care (34% vs. 59%, p = 0.008), had more changes in place of care during the last two weeks of life (p < 0.0001) and died more often in acute hospitals (34% vs. 14%, p < 0.0001). For the subgroup with access to palliative care, the hospital deaths for individuals with and without a COVID-19 diagnosis were 11% and 4%, respectively (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Cancer patients dying with a COVID-19 diagnosis were older, more often male, and had more comorbidities. A COVID-19 diagnosis negatively affected the probability of being admitted to specialized palliative care and increased the likelihood of dying in an acute hospital.","Strang, Peter; Hedman, Christel; Adlitzer, Helena; Schultz, Torbjörn",Acta Oncol,363,1

However, although SARS infected some 10,000 individuals, killing around 1000, it did not lead to the devastating health impact that many feared, but a rather disproportionate economic impact. The disproportionate scale and nature of this impact has caused concern that outbreaks of more serious disease could cause catastrophic impacts on the global economy. Understanding factors that led to the impact of SARS might help to deal with the possible impact and management of such other infectious disease outbreaks. In this respect, the role of risk—its perception, communication and management—is critical. This paper looks at the role that risk, and especially the perception of risk, its communication and management, played in driving the economic impact of SARS. It considers the public and public health response to SARS, the role of the media and official organisations, and proposes policy and research priorities for establishing a system to better deal with the next global infectious disease outbreak. It is concluded that the potential for the rapid spread of infectious disease is not necessarily a greater threat than it has always been, but the effect that an outbreak can have on the economy is, which requires further research and policy development.","Smith, Richard D.",Soc Sci Med,363,1

Methods: This study is part of the Barcelona ResIlience Survey for Mental Health COVID-19 (BRIS-MHC) project. Logistic regression models were performed to identify mental health outcomes associated with bad state resilience and predictors of good state resilience. The association between state resilience and specific affective temperaments as well as their influence on the association between depressive symptoms and state resilience were verified. Results: The study recruited 898 participants that took part in the survey. The presence of depressive symptoms was a predictor of bad state resilience in PP (β=0.110, OR=1.117, p=0.028). No specific mental health outcome was associated with bad state resilience in UR and CC. Predictors of good state resilience in PP were having pursued hobbies/conducted home tasks (β=1.261, OR=3.528, p=0.044) and level of organization in the family (β=0.986, OR=2.682, p=0.008). Having a controlling family was inversely associated with good state resilience in CC (β=-1.004, OR=0.367, p=0.012).

The urgency and severity of the pandemic forces the use of segregation in restricted areas and confinement in individual rooms as desperate strategies to avoid the spread of disease and the worst-case scenario of becoming a deadly trap. The conceptualization of the post–COVID-19 era implies strong efforts to redesign all living conditions, care/rehabilitation interventions, and management of loneliness forced by social distance measures. Recently, a study of gender differences in COVID-19 found that men are more likely to suffer more severe effects of the disease and are over twice as likely to die. It is well-known that dementia is associated with increased mortality, and males have worse survival and deranged neuro-immuno-endocrine systems than females. The present study examines the impact of long-term isolation in male 3xTg-AD mice modeling advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and as compared to age-matched counterparts with normal aging. We used a battery of ethological and unconditioned tests resembling several areas in nursing homes. The main findings refer to an exacerbated (two-fold increase) hyperactivity and emergence of bizarre behaviors in isolated 3xTg-AD mice, worrisome results since agitation is a challenge in the clinical management of dementia and an important cause of caregiver burden. This increase was consistently shown in gross (activity in most of the tests) and fine (thermoregulatory nesting) motor functions. Isolated animals also exhibited re-structured anxiety-like patterns and coping-with-stress strategies. Bodyweight and kidney weight loss were found in AD-phenotypes and increased by isolation. Spleen weight loss was isolation dependent. Hippocampal tau pathology was not modified, but asymmetric atrophy of the hippocampus, recently described in human patients with dementia and modeled here for the first time in an animal model of AD, was found to increase with isolation. Overall, the results show awareness of the impact of isolation in elderly patients with dementia, offering some guidance from translational neuroscience in these times of coronavirus and post–COVID-19 pandemic.

A comprehensive review study,16.581285,11.987285,2020-11-26,"Second wave of COVID 19 pandemic in India came with unexpected quick speed and intensity, creating an acute shortage of beds, ventilators, and oxygen at the peak of occurrence. This may have been partly caused by emergence of new variant delta. Clinical experience with the cases admitted to hospitals suggested that it is not merely a steep rise in cases but also possibly the case profile is different. This study was taken up to investigate the differentials in the characteristics of the cases admitted in the second wave versus those admitted in the first wave. Records of a total of 14398 cases admitted in the first wave (2020) to our network of hospitals in north India and 5454 cases admitted in the second wave (2021) were retrieved, making it the largest study of this kind in India. Their demographic profile, clinical features, management, and outcome was studied. Age sex distribution of the cases in the second wave was not much different from those admitted in the first wave but the patients with comorbidities and those with greater severity had larger share. Level of inflammatory markers was more adverse. More patients needed oxygen and invasive ventilation. ICU admission rate remained nearly the same. On the positive side, readmissions were lower, and the duration of hospitalization was slightly less. Usage of drugs like remdesivir and IVIG was higher while that of favipiravir and tocilizumab was lower. Steroid and anticoagulant use remained high and almost same during the two waves. More patients had secondary bacterial and fungal infections in Wave 2. Mortality increased by almost 40% in Wave 2, particularly in the younger patients of age less than 45 years. Higher mortality was observed in those admitted in wards, ICU, with or without ventilator support and those who received convalescent plasma. No significant demographic differences in the cases in these two waves, indicates the role of other factors such as delta variant and late admissions in higher severity and more deaths. Comorbidity and higher secondary bacterial and fungal infections may have contributed to increased mortality.","Budhiraja, S.; Indrayan, A.; Aggarwal, M.; Jha, V.; Jain, D.; Tarai, B.; Das, P.; Aggarwal, B.; Mishra, R.

Epidemiologic investigations identified dromedary camels as the likely source of zoonotic transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here we provide experimental support for camels as a reservoir for MERS-CoV. We inoculated 3 adult camels with a human isolate of MERS-CoV and a transient, primarily upper respiratory tract infection developed in each of the 3 animals. Clinical signs of the MERS-CoV infection were benign, but each of the camels shed large quantities of virus from the upper respiratory tract. We detected infectious virus in nasal secretions through 7 days postinoculation, and viral RNA up to 35 days postinoculation. The pattern of shedding and propensity for the upper respiratory tract infection in dromedary camels may help explain the lack of systemic illness among naturally infected camels and the means of efficient camel-to-camel and camel-to-human transmission.","Adney, Danielle R.; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Brown, Vienna R.; Bushmaker, Trenton; Scott, Dana; de Wit, Emmie; Bowen, Richard A.; Munster, Vincent J.",Emerg Infect Dis,363,9

However, two SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks occurred among intercollegiate university athletic programs during the fall 2020 semester despite mandatory directly observed daily antigen testing. METHODS: During the fall 2020 semester, athletes and staff in both programs were tested daily using Quidel’s Sofia SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA), with positive antigen results requiring confirmatory testing with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We used genomic sequencing to investigate transmission dynamics in these two outbreaks. RESULTS: In Outbreak 1, 32 confirmed cases occurred within a university athletics program after the index patient attended a meeting while infectious despite a negative antigen test on the day of the meeting. Among isolates sequenced from Outbreak 1, 24 (92%) of 26 were closely related, suggesting sustained transmission following an initial introduction event. In Outbreak 2, 12 confirmed cases occurred among athletes from two university programs that faced each other in an athletic competition despite receiving negative antigen test results on the day of the competition. Sequences from both teams were closely related and unique from strains circulating in the community, suggesting transmission during intercollegiate competition. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that antigen testing alone, even when mandated and directly observed, may not be sufficient as an intervention to prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in congregate settings, and highlights the importance of supplementing serial antigen testing with appropriate mitigation strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in congregate settings.","Moreno, Gage K.; Braun, Katarina M.; Pray, Ian W.; Segaloff, Hannah E.; Lim, Ailam; Poulson, Keith; Meiman, Jonathan; Borcher, James; Westergaard, Ryan P.; Moll, Michael K.; Friedrich, Thomas C.; O’Connor, David H.",medRxiv,363,11

Children and young people with pre-existing mental health difficulties may be prone to loneliness. Containment of COVID-19 has necessitated widespread social isolation, with unprecedented school closures and restrictions imposed on social interactions. This rapid review aimed to establish what is known about the relationship between loneliness and mental health problems in children and young people with pre-existing mental health problems. METHODS We sought to identify all primary research that examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between loneliness/perceived social isolation and mental health in children and young people with pre-existing mental health problems. We also aimed to identify effective interventions that reduce the adverse impact of loneliness. A rapid systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. RESULTS Of 4,531 papers screened, 15 included children and young people with pre-existing mental health conditions. These 15 studies included 1,536 children and young people aged between 6 and 23 years with social phobia, anxiety and/or depression, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Loneliness was associated with anxiety and depression both cross-sectionally and prospectively in children and young people with mental health problems and neurodevelopmental conditions. We found preliminary evidence that psychological treatments can help to reduce feelings of loneliness in this population. CONCLUSIONS Loneliness is associated with depression and anxiety in children and young people with pre-existing mental health conditions, and this relationship may be bidirectional. Existing interventions to address loneliness and/or mental health difficulties in other contexts may be applied to this population, although they may need adaptation and testing in younger children and adolescents. PRACTITIONER POINTS Loneliness is common in children and young people, and during periods of enforced social isolation such as during COVID-19, children and young people report high levels of loneliness (or increased rates of loneliness). The review showed that loneliness is associated, both cross-sectionally and prospectively, in children and young people with mental health problems and also in children and young people with neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder. Thus, loneliness is a possible risk factor of which mental health providers should be aware. Maintaining social contact both by direct and by indirect means, especially through the Internet, could be important in mitigating loneliness. Interventions to address loneliness should be further developed and tested to help children and young people with pre-existing mental health problems who are lonely by preventing exacerbation of their mental health difficulties, in particular anxiety and depression.","Hards, Emily; Loades, Maria Elizabeth; Higson-Sweeney, Nina; Shafran, Roz; Serafimova, Teona; Brigden, Amberley; Reynolds, Shirley; Crawley, Esther; Chatburn, Eleanor; Linney, Catherine; McManus, Megan; Borwick, Catherine",The British journal of clinical psychology,363,18

After over six-month spread of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 causes critical threats to global public health and economy. The investigations on evolution and genotyping on genetic variations are of great importance, therefore, the present study characterized the molecular variation of SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing 4230 complete genome sequences from the worldwide samples collected during the first 6-month pandemic. Phylogenetic tree analysis with Neighbor-Joining and Maximum-Parsimony methods indicated that the haplotypes of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were classified into four clades with the unique nucleotide and amino acid changes: T27879C (ORF8 L84S) in clade 1 (25.34%), A23138G (spike D614G) in clade 2 (63.54%), G10818T (nsp6 L37F), C14540T (nsp12 T442I), and G25879T (ORF3a V251F) in clade 3 (2.58%), and miscellaneous changes in clade 4 (8.54%). Interestingly, subclade 2B with the amino acid changes at nsp2 T85I, Spike D614G, and ORF3a Q57H was firstly reported on March 4, 2020 in United States of America, becoming the most frequent sub-haplogroup in the world (36.21%) and America (45.81%). Subclade 1C with the amino acid changes at nsp13 P504L and ORF8 L84S was becoming the second most frequent sub-haplogroup in the world (19.91%) and America (26.29%). Subclade 2A with the amino acid changes in Spike D614G and Nucleocapsid R203K and G204R was highly prevalent in Asia (18.82%) and Europe (29.72%). The study highlights the notable clades and sub-clades with unique mutations, revealing the genetic and geographical relevant post the six-month outbreak of COVID-19.

The objective was to report the postoperative mortality after elective digestive resections in a nationwide cohort during the lockdown period. METHOD: This is analytic study was performed using a national billing database (PMSI). Patients who underwent elective digestive resections were divided in two group: the lockdown group defined by hospital admissions between March 17(th) and May 11(th) 2020; and the control group, defined by hospital admissions during the corresponding period in 2019. Groups were matched on propensity score, geographical region, and surgical procedure. The primary outcome was the postoperative mortality. RESULTS: The overall population included 15,217 patients, 9325 patients in the control group and 5892 in the lockdown group. The overall surgical activity was decreased by 37% during the lockdown period. The overall in-hospital mortality during the hospital stay was 2.7%. After matching and adjustment, no difference in mortality between groups was reported (OR=1.05; 95%CI: 0.83–1.34; p=0.669). An asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was a risk factor for a twofold increased mortality whereas a symptomatic COVID-19 infection was associated with a tenfold increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a considerable reduction in the surgical activity for elective digestive resections during the lockdown period, mortality remained stable on a nationwide scale in COVID-free patients. These findings support that systematic SARS-CoV-2 screening should be advocated prior to elective gastrointestinal surgery and that all efforts should be made to maintain elective surgical resection for cancer during the second wave in COVID-free patients.","Challine, A.; Dousset, B.; de’Angelis, N.; Lefèvre, J.H.; Parc, Y.; Katsahian, S.; Lazzati, A.",Surgery,363,20

Accordingly, this study aims to examine the effects of a pilot social prescribing project for elderly people in rural area of South Korea during the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: Using the PRECEDE‐PROCEED model, the effectiveness of the pilot project was verified through pre‐ and post‐impact and outcome evaluation. RESULTS: According to the results of the impact evaluation, loneliness reduced significantly, while the social participation attitude score increased. Although the average score of self‐efficacy increased, it was not statistically significant. Moreover, it was found that self‐esteem increased significantly. In the outcome evaluation, depression reduced considerably. CONCLUSION: To conclude, the pilot social prescribing project was effective in reducing depression and loneliness for the elderly in rural areas of Korea. It was also confirmed that there is potential to develop a new health promotion project that can improve the self‐esteem of the elderly, and expand their social activities. Second, the pilot project was carried out in an integrated manner by utilizing resources in communities with good accessibility. Therefore, it is expected to be used as a new “Integrated community care model” to improve the mental health of the elderly in rural areas. Third, during the COVID‐19 pandemic, the elderly tend to experience increasing feelings of depression, isolation, and loneliness due to “social distancing.” Therefore, it is expected that social prescribing programs for the elderly in rural areas would become a new alternative for relieve mental disorder of the seniors.","Kim, Ji Eon; Lee, Yu Lim; Chung, Min Ah; Yoon, Hye Jin; Shin, Dong Eun; Choi, Jin Hee; Lee, Sangheon; Kim, Hae Kyung; Nam, Eun Woo",Health Sci Rep,363,22

How to activate host immunity against specific TAAs and to suppress tumor growth therefore becomes important in cancer therapy development. RESULTS: To enhance the immune efficiency of CEA in mice that received, we fused a partial CEA gene with exogenous SARS-CoV fragments. Oral vaccination of an attenuated Salmonella typhimurium strain transformed with plasmids encoding CEA-SARS-CoV fusion gene into BALB/c mice elicited significant increases in TNF-α and IL-10 in the serum. In addition, a smaller tumor volume was observed in CT26/CEA-bearing mice who received CEA-SARS-CoV gene therapy in comparison with those administered CEA alone. CONCLUSION: The administration of fusing CEA-SARS-CoV fragments may provide a promising strategy for strengthening the anti-tumor efficacy against low-immunogenic endogenous tumor antigens.","Lin, Chen-Si; Kao, Shih-Han; Chen, Yu-Cheng; Li, Chi-Han; Hsieh, Yuan-Ting; Yang, Shang-Chih; Wu, Chang-Jer; Lee, Ru-Ping; Liao, Kuang-Wen",Biol Proced Online,363,2

In our study, we describe the demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics; clinical progression; and outcome of 1,263 asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients isolated in one such CCC between May 4, 2020 and June 4, 2020. Around 10.5% of the patients progressed to moderate/severe illness, requiring referral for tertiary care, and three died. Nearly half (49.5%) of the patients were symptomatic at the time of admission, 2.2% of the patients developed symptoms post-testing, and 48.5% patients remained asymptomatic during the entire course of illness. Most common presenting symptoms were fever (69.9%) and cough (29.6%), followed by generalized body pain, breathlessness, and loss of smell and taste.

The risk of spreading the virus is high, and procedures for viral load reduction in the oral cavity are important. Little research to date has been performed on the effect of mouthwashes on the salivary SARS-CoV-2 viral load. This pilot randomized single-center clinical trial investigated whether three types of mouthwash with solutions containing either 0.075% cetylpyridinium chloride plus 0.28% zinc lactate (CPC + Zn), 1.5% hydrogen peroxide (HP), or 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) reduce the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva at different time points. Sixty SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were recruited and randomly partitioned into a placebo (oral rinsing with distilled water) group and other groups according to the type of mouthwash. Saliva samples were collected from the participants before rinsing (T0), immediately after rinsing (T1), 30 min after rinsing (T2), and 60 min after rinsing (T3). The salivary SARS-CoV-2 viral load was measured by qRT-PCR assays. Rinsing with HP and CPC + Zn resulted in better reductions in viral load, with 15.8 ± 0.08- and 20.4 ± 3.7-fold reductions at T1, respectively. Although the CPC + Zn group maintained a 2.6 ± 0.1-fold reduction at T3, this trend was not observed for HP. HP mouthwash resulted in a significant reduction in the SARS-CoV-2 viral load up to 30 min after rinsing (6.5 ± 3.4). The CHX mouthwash significantly reduced the viral load at T1, T2, and T3 (2.1 ± 1.5-, 6.2 ± 3.8-, and 4.2 ± 2.4-fold reductions, respectively). In conclusion, mouthwash with CPC + Zinc and CHX resulted in significant reductions of the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva up to 60 mins after rinsing, while HP mouthwash resulted in a significant reduction up to 30 mins after rinsing.

Demand on capacity, concerns for transplant recipients, including the risks of nosocomial infection, and the availability and safety of donors, lead to continuation of transplantation for only urgent and super-urgent, in-patient candidates, in the UK from March to May 2020. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of these practice changes on heart and lung donor utilisation during the pandemic period. Methods Data on all adult and paediatric heart and lung donors offered, and transplants performed, between 1 March and 30 September 2019 and 1 March and 30 September 2020 were obtained from the UK Transplant Registry. The early pandemic period is defined as 1 March to 31 May 2020. Ideal lung donors are defined as age <56 years and no smoking history. Results Lung transplant activity during the early pandemic period fell by 77% (13 transplants compared to 56 in 2019). Heart transplant activity fell by 10% (38 compared to 42 heart transplants in 2019). The number of donors, who donated at least 1 solid organ, fell by 51%. The lung donor utilisation rate during the early pandemic period was 11%, compared to 24% for the same period of 2019. The heart donor utilisation rate during the pandemic period was 35% compared to 26% during the same period of 2019. The proportion of ideal lung donors, from donors where lung(s) were offered, was 23% in 2020 compared to 24% in 2019. Following the early pandemic period (1 June to 30 September 2020), there has been an increase in the number of lung donors, lung transplant activity and utilisation, rising from 11% in March to May to 14% in June to September. This compares with a utilisation rate of 21% for the same period of 2019. Conclusion During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, changes to practice led to the continuation of heart transplantation, with minimal impact on activity, whilst lung transplant activity fell. The number of organ donors fell, while the ‘quality’ of potential lung donors remained unchanged. As the evidence base guiding clinical practice is evolving, along with improved donor testing, lung transplant activity is again increasing, however the utilisation of donors remains lower than in 2019. On-going analysis of activity is required to fully assess the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the UK lung transplant population.","Hardman, G.; Hogg, R.; Al-Aloul, M.; Berman, M.; Clark, S.; Booth, K.; Dark, J.

Results Among 764 patients, 116 (15%) either died (n = 87) or were transitioned to hospice care (n = 29) during their hospitalization. The median LOS was 5 days (range 1 - 44 days) for patients admitted to the regular nursing floor and 10 days (range 1-38 days) for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients who died during hospitalization were older, initially admitted to the ICU, more likely to be white and to have worse organ dysfunction compared to patients who survived their hospitalization. Using the 10 most important variables only, the final model’s area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve was 0.86 for 7-day, 0.88 for 14-day, and 0.85 for 30-day mortality in the validation cohort. Conclusions We developed a decision tool that can provide explainable and patient-specific prediction of in-hospital mortality and LOS for COVID-19 positive patients. The model can aid healthcare systems in bed allocation and distribution of vital resources.","Rozenbaum, Daniel; Shreve, Jacob; Radakovich, Nathan; Douggal, Abhijit; Jehi, Lara; Nazha, Aziz",Mayo Clin Proc Innov Qual Outcomes,363,1

While other upper respiratory viruses are known to produce such disruptions, their occurrence with the deadly and highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus raised new questions about the nature of the deficits, their cause, and whether they might serve as indicators of the onset of the disease. Published in the July and August 2020 issues of Chemical Senses are 2 innovative, large-scale survey studies that were quickly devised and launched by separate multinational groups to address these questions in olfaction, taste, and chemesthesis. The surveys, which took different approaches and had somewhat different goals, add significant new data on the incidence and severity of smell loss in COVID-19, and the potential for olfactory dysfunction to serve as an indicator of the spread and severity of the disease. Less definitive evidence of the frequency, characteristics, and magnitude of disruptions in taste and chemesthesis point to the need for future survey studies that combine and refine the strengths of the present ones, as well as clinical studies designed to selectively measure deficits in all 3 chemosensory systems.","Green, Barry G",Chem Senses,363,10

We studied the mortality and associated risks of COVID-19 infection in dialysis patients in the state of Qatar. METHODS: This was an observational, analytical, retrospective, nationwide study. We included all adult patients on maintenance dialysis therapy who tested positive for COVID-19 (PCR assay of the nasopharyngeal swab) during the period from February 1, 2020, to July 19, 2020. Our primary outcome was to study the mortality of COVID-19 in dialysis patients in Qatar and risk factors associated with it. Our secondary objectives were to study incidence and severity of COVID-19 in dialysis patients and comparing outcomes between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. Patient demographics and clinical features were collected from a national electronic medical record. Univariate Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate potential risk factors for mortality in our cohort. RESULTS: 76 out of 1064 dialysis patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (age 56±13.6, 56 hemodialysis and 20 peritoneal dialysis, 56 males). During the study period, 7.1% of all dialysis patients contracted COVID-19. Male dialysis patients had double the incidence of COVID-19 than females (9% versus 4.5% respectively; p<0.01). The most common symptoms on presentation were fever (57.9%), cough (56.6%), and shortness of breath (25%). Pneumonia was diagnosed in 72% of dialysis patients with COVID-19. High severity manifested as 25% of patients requiring admission to the intensive care unit, 18.4% had ARDS, 17.1% required mechanical ventilation, and 14.5% required inotropes. The mean length of hospital stay was 19.2 ± -12 days. Mortality due to COVID-19 among our dialysis cohort was 15%. Univariate Cox regression analysis for risk factors associated with COVID-19-related death in dialysis patients showed significant increases in risks with age (OR 1.077, CI 95%(1.018–1.139), p = 0.01), CHF and COPD (both same OR 8.974, CI 95% (1.039–77.5), p = 0.046), history of DVT (OR 5.762, CI 95% (1.227–27.057), p = 0.026), Atrial fibrillation (OR 7.285, CI 95%(2.029–26.150), p = 0.002), hypoxia (OR: 16.6; CI 95%(3.574–77.715), p = <0.001), ICU admission (HR30.8, CI 95% (3.9–241.2), p = 0.001), Mechanical ventilation (HR 50.07 CI 95% (6.4–391.2)), p<0.001) and using inotropes(HR 19.17, CI 95% (11.57–718.5), p<0.001). In a multivariate analysis, only ICU admission was found to be significantly associated with death [OR = 32.8 (3.5–305.4), p = 0.002)]. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to be conducted at a national level in Qatar exploring COVID-19 in a dialysis population. Dialysis patients had a high incidence of COVID-19 infection and related mortality compared to previous reports of the general population in the state of Qatar (7.1% versus 4% and 15% versus 0.15% respectively). We also observed a strong association between death related to COVID-19 infection in dialysis patients and admission to ICU.","Ghonimi, Tarek Abdel Latif; Alkad, Mohamad Mahmood; Abuhelaiqa, Essa Abdulla; Othman, Muftah M.; Elgaali, Musab Ahmed; Ibrahim, Rania Abdelaziz M.; Joseph, Shajahan M.; Al-Malki, Hassan Ali; Hamad, Abdullah Ibrahim",PLoS One,363,1

The goal of this report is to provide an update on the epidemic and review current progress in the development, evaluation and deployment of prevention and treatment strategies for EVD. Relevant information was identified through a comprehensive literature search using Medline, PubMed and CINAHL Complete and using the search terms Ebola, Ebola virus disease, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, West Africa outbreak, Ebola transmission, Ebola symptoms and signs, Ebola diagnosis, Ebola treatment, vaccines for Ebola and clinical trials on Ebola. Through 22 July 2015, a total of 27,741 EVD cases and 11,284 deaths were reported from all affected countries. Several therapeutic agents and novel vaccines for EVD have been developed and are now undergoing evaluation. Concurrent with active case investigation, contact tracing, surveillance and supportive care to patients and communities, there has been rapid progress in the development of new therapies and vaccines against EVD. Continued focus on strengthening clinical and public health infrastructure will have direct benefits in controlling the spread of EVD and will provide a strong foundation for deployment of new drugs and vaccines to affected countries when they become available. The unprecedented West Africa Ebola outbreak, response measures, and ensuing drug and vaccine development suggest that new tools for Ebola control may be available in the near future.

We aimed to assess the national impact of COVID-19 on the prescribing of systemic anticancer treatment in England, immediately after lockdown and after the introduction of new treatments to reduce patient risk. METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis using data from a central National Health Service England web database mandated for clinicians to register intention to start all new systemic anticancer treatments approved for use in England since 2016. We analysed the monthly number of treatment registrations in April, 2020, after the implementation of societal lockdown on March 23, 2020, and after implementation of treatment options to reduce patient risk such as oral or less immunosuppressive drugs, in May and June, 2020. We compared the number of registrations in April–June, 2020, with the mean number of registrations and SD during the previous 6 months of unaffected cancer care (September, 2019, to February, 2020). We calculated the percentage change and absolute difference in SD units for the number of registrations overall, by tumour type, and by type and line of therapy. FINDINGS: In April, 2020, 2969 registrations were recorded, representing 1417 fewer registrations than in the control period (monthly mean 4386; 32% reduction, absolute difference 4·2 SDs, p<0·0001). In May, 2020, total registrations increased to 3950, representing a 10% reduction compared with the control period (absolute difference 1·3 SDs, p<0·0001). In June, 2020, 5022 registrations were recorded, representing a 15% increase compared with the control period (absolute difference 1·9 SDs; p<0·0001]). INTERPRETATION: After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a reduction in systemic anticancer treatment initiation in England. However, following introduction of treatment options to reduce patient risk, registrations began to increase in May, 2020, and reached higher numbers than the pre-pandemic mean in June, 2020, when other clinical and societal risk mitigation factors (such as telephone consultations, facemasks and physical distancing) are likely to have contributed. However, outcomes of providing less treatment or delaying treatment initiation, particularly for advanced cancers and neoadjuvant therapies, require continued assessment.

Currently, approximately 8.8 million people have already been infected and more than 465,740 people have died worldwide. An important step in combating COVID-19 is the screening of infected patients using chest X-ray (CXR) images. However, this task is extremely time-consuming and prone to variability among specialists owing to its heterogeneity. Therefore, the present study aims to assist specialists in identifying COVID-19 patients from their chest radiographs, using automated computational techniques. The proposed method has four main steps: (1) the acquisition of the dataset, from two public databases; (2) the standardization of images through preprocessing; (3) the extraction of features using a deep features-based approach implemented through the networks VGG19, Inception-v3, and ResNet50; (4) the classifying of images into COVID-19 groups, using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO). In the best-case scenario, the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 98.71%, a precision of 98.89%, a recall of 99.63%, and an F1-score of 99.25%. In our study, we demonstrated that the problem of classifying CXR images of patients under COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 conditions can be solved efficiently by combining a deep features-based approach with a robust classifier (XGBoost) optimized by an evolutionary algorithm (PSO). The proposed method offers considerable advantages for clinicians seeking to tackle the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Dias Júnior, Domingos Alves; da Cruz, Luana Batista; Bandeira Diniz, João Otávio; França da Silva, Giovanni Lucca; Junior, Geraldo Braz; Silva, Aristófanes Corrêa; de Paiva, Anselmo Cardoso; Nunes, Rodolfo Acatauassú; Gattass, Marcelo",Expert Syst Appl,363,32

Yet, the practical challenge of adjusting pooling designs based on infection rate has not been systematically addressed. In particular, there are both theoretical interests and practical motivation to analyze one-stage group testing at finite, practical problem sizes, rather than asymptotic ones, under noisy, rather than perfect tests, and when the number of positives is randomly distributed, rather than fixed. Here, we study noisy group testing under the probabilistic framework by modeling the infection vector as a random vector with Bernoulli entries. Our main contributions include a practical one-stage group testing protocol guided by maximizing pool entropy and a maximum-likelihood recovery algorithm under the probabilistic framework. Our findings highlight the implications of introducing randomness to the infection vectors -- we find that the combinatorial structure of the pooling designs plays a less important role than the parameters such as pool size and redundancy.","Liu, Y.; Kadyan, S.; Pe'er, I.",,363,16

We assessed the prevalence and characteristics of PDs in COVID-19 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) and negative CTPA. METHODS: This retrospective study included COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia groups of patients with DE-CTPA negative for PE. Two radiologists rated the presence of PD within the lung opacities and analyzed the type of lung opacities and PD pattern (i.e. homogeneous or heterogeneous). The clinical, biological, radiological characteristics including time from first symptoms and admission to DE-CTPA, oxygen requirements, CRP, D-dimer levels, duration of hospital admission and death were compared within the COVID-19 group between patients with (PD +) or without PD (PD-). RESULTS: 67 COVID-19 and 79 non-COVID-19 patients were included. PDs were more frequent in the COVID-19 than in the non-COVID-19 group (59.7% and 26.6% respectively, p < 0.001). Patterns of PDs were different, with COVID-19 patients exhibiting heterogenous PDs (38/40, 95%) whereas non-COVID-19 patients showed mostly homogeneous perfusion defects (7/21 heterogeneous PDs, 33%), p < 0.001. In COVID-19 patients, most consolidations (9/10, 90%) exhibited PDs while less than a third of consolidations (19/67, 28%) had PDs in non-COVID-19 patients. D-dimer, oxygen levels and outcome were similar between COVID-19 PD + and PD- patients; however, time between admission and DE-CTPA was longer in PD + patients (median [IQR], 1 [0–7] and 0 [0–2]; p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Unlike in bacterial pneumonia, heterogeneous PDs within lung opacities are a frequent feature of COVID-19 pneumonia in PE-suspected patients.","Le Berre, Alice; Boeken, Tom; Caramella, Caroline; Afonso, Daniel; Nhy, Caroline; Saccenti, Laetitia; Tardivel, Anne-Marie; Gerber, Sophie; Frison Roche, Adrien; Emmerich, Joseph; Marini, Valeria; Zins, Marc; Toledano, Sarah",Insights Imaging,363,7

Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax are uncommon complications of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Herein, we describe a fatal case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax. PATIENT CONCERNS: Subcutaneous emphysema was found in neck, bilateral chest walls, abdomen wall, groin area, and scrotum of a 67-year-old man. Extensive air-space opacities, subcutaneous emphysema and a small amount of pneumothorax were found in his chest X-ray scan. Echocardiography showed left ventricular enlargement with ejection fraction 20%. DIAGNOSIS: This resident of Wuhan with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection had chronic pulmonary and cardiac diseases. Liver dysfunction, myocardial injury, and coagulation disorder were suggested by laboratory findings. Pneumonia, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumothorax were confirmed with chest X-ray. Heart failure was revealed by echocardiography. INTERVENTIONS: He was transferred to intensive care unit, where invasive ventilation was used for him during the whole hospitalization. Prone position ventilation, vasoconstrictor, antibacteria, and antiviral therapy were given. OUTCOMES: He died on the twelfth day after admission. CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax may occur in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and chronic pulmonary disease. Chronic cardiac disease might be aggravated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and develop heart failure.","Xiang, Chunlin; Wu, Gang",Medicine (Baltimore),363,16

Virus specific epitopes could benefit for developing JEV specific antibodies detection methods. To identify the JEV specific epitopes, we fully mapped and characterized the continuous B-cell epitope of the PrM/M protein of JEV. RESULTS: To map the epitopes on the PrM/M protein, we designed a set of 20 partially overlapping fragments spanning the whole PrM, fused them with GST, and expressed them in an expression vector. Linear epitope M14 ((105)VNKKEAWLDSTKATRY(120)) was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). By removing amino acid residues individually from the carboxy and amino terminal of peptide M14, we confirmed that the minimal unit of the linear epitope of PrM/M was M14-13 ((108)KEAWLDSTKAT(118)). This epitope was highly conserved across different JEV strains. Moreover, this epitope did not cross-react with WNV-positive and DENV-positive sera.

They make it possible to identify and analyze the target protein against a background of a large number of other proteins, either in whole fixed cells or in cell lysates. This chapter describes our experience with the production of such rabbit antisera directed against proteins of coronaviruses and other nidoviruses. The use as antigens of either synthetic peptides (coupled to a carrier protein) or proteins expressed in Escherichia coli is described, and detailed protocols for immunization and preparation of test bleeds are provided. For screening of the immune response following immunization, detailed protocols for three commonly used techniques are described, all of which are based on the use of infected cells or cells expressing the protein of interest, side by side with appropriate controls. The in situ immunodetection of the target in fixed cells by immunofluorescence microscopy is described, as are protocols for techniques that can be applied to cell lysates containing the target protein (Western blotting and immunoprecipitation). The latter techniques are performed in combination with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thus allowing confirmation of the molecular weight of the target that is recognized by the antiserum.","Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C.; Wassenaar, Alfred L.

Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci 265:363–373, 2015) have been revised by a consensus group consisting of 35 experts representing the 29 leading German specialist societies and patient self-help organizations. While the first version of the guideline was based on 403 randomized controlled studies (RCTs), 92 additional RCTs have been included in this revision. According to the consensus committee, anxiety disorders should be treated with psychotherapy, pharmacological drugs, or their combination. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was regarded as the psychological treatment with the highest level of evidence. Psychodynamic therapy (PDT) was recommended when CBT was not effective or unavailable or when PDT was preferred by the patient informed about more effective alternatives. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended as first-line drugs for anxiety disorders. Medications should be continued for 6–12 months after remission. When either medications or psychotherapy were not effective, treatment should be switched to the other approach or to their combination. For patients non-responsive to standard treatments, a number of alternative strategies have been suggested. An individual treatment plan should consider efficacy, side effects, costs and the preference of the patient. Changes in the revision include recommendations regarding virtual reality exposure therapy, Internet interventions and systemic therapy. The recommendations are not only applicable for Germany but may also be helpful for developing treatment plans in all other countries.","Bandelow, Borwin; Werner, Antonia M.; Kopp, Ina; Rudolf, Sebastian; Wiltink, Jörg; Beutel, Manfred E.",Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci,363,12

However, the prevalence of these co-existing medical conditions in severe CHIKV cases has not been systematically reported. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to describe the prevalence of chronic comorbidities in CHIKV and evaluate their possible contributions to disease severity. METHODS: A search strategy was developed for online databases. Search terms used were “Chikungunya” AND “Diabetes, Hypertension, Stroke, Cardiovascular Diseases, Coronary Artery Diseases, Obesity, OR Asthma”. Only 11 articles documenting the frequency of comorbidities in CHIKV were included. Meta-analyses were conducted to evaluate the overall prevalence of comorbidities in the CHIKV infection and stratify the estimates by severity. RESULTS: Among 2,773 CHIKV patients, hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity (31.3%; 95%CI: 17.9-48.8%) followed by diabetes (20.5%; 95%CI: 12.7-31.3%), cardiac diseases (14.8%; 95%CI: 8.1-25.5%) and asthma (7.9%; 95%CI: 3.3-17.7). There was 4- to 5-fold significant increased prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and cardiac diseases in CHIKV patients over 50 years of age compared to their younger counterparts. Severe CHIKV cases had a significantly higher proportion of diabetes than non-severe cases (p < 0.05). CHIKV patients with diabetes had OR of 1.2 (95%CI: 1.05-1.48; p = 0.0135) for developing severe infection outcome compared to those with no diabetes. CONCLUSION: Hypertension, diabetes and cardiac diseases may contribute to the severe outcome of CHIKV. Diabetic subjects may be at higher risk of severe infection. These findings may be relevant in developing public health measures and practices targeting CHIKV patients with comorbidities to avert the severe outcome of the infectious disease.","Badawi, Alaa; Ryoo, Seung Gwan; Vasileva, Denitsa; Yaghoubi, Sahar",Int J Infect Dis,363,16

We estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccines against this variant. Methods: A test negative case control design was used to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease with both variants over the period that B.1.617.2 began circulating with cases identified based on sequencing and S-gene target status. Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of COVID-19 in England was used to estimate the proportion of cases with B.1.617.2 compared to the predominant strain (B.1.1.7) by vaccination status. Results: Effectiveness was notably lower after 1 dose of vaccine with B.1.617.2 cases 33.5% (95%CI: 20.6 to 44.3) compared to B.1.1.7 cases 51.1% (95%CI: 47.3 to 54.7) with similar results for both vaccines. With BNT162b2 2 dose effectiveness reduced from 93.4% (95%CI: 90.4 to 95.5) with B.1.1.7 to 87.9% (95%CI: 78.2 to 93.2) with B.1.617.2. With ChAdOx1 2 dose effectiveness reduced from 66.1% (95% CI: 54.0 to 75.0) with B.1.1.7 to 59.8% (95%CI: 28.9 to 77.3) with B.1.617.2. Sequenced cases detected after 1 or 2 doses of vaccination had a higher odds of infection with B.1.617.2 compared to unvaccinated cases (OR 1.40; 95%CI: 1.13-1.75). Conclusions: After 2 doses of either vaccine there were only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness with the B.1.617.2 variant. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked with dose 1. This would support maximising vaccine uptake with two doses among vulnerable groups.","Lopez Bernal, J.; Andrews, N.; Gower, C.; Gallagher, E.; Simmons, R.; Thelwall, S.; Tessier, E.; Groves, N.; Dabrera, G.; Myers, R.; Campbell, C.; Amirthalingam, G.; Edmunds, M.; Zambon, M.; Brown, K.; Hopkins, S.; Chand, M.; Ramsay, M.",,363,16

Loss of smell and taste have emerged as main predictors for COVID-19. The objective of our study is to develop a comprehensive machine learning (ML) modelling framework to assess the predictive value of smell and taste disorders, along with other symptoms, in COVID-19 infection. A multicenter case-control study was performed, in which suspected cases for COVID-19, who were tested by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), informed about the presence and severity of their symptoms using visual analog scales (VAS). ML algorithms were applied to the collected data to predict a COVID-19 diagnosis using a 50-fold cross-validation scheme by randomly splitting the patients in training (75%) and testing datasets (25%). A total of 777 patients were included. Loss of smell and taste were found to be the symptoms with higher odds ratios of 6.21 and 2.42 for COVID-19 positivity. The ML algorithms applied reached an average accuracy of 80%, a sensitivity of 82%, and a specificity of 78% when using VAS to predict a COVID-19 diagnosis. This study concludes that smell and taste disorders are accurate predictors, with ML algorithms constituting helpful tools for COVID-19 diagnostic prediction.","Callejon-Leblic, María A; Moreno-Luna, Ramon; Del Cuvillo, Alfonso; Reyes-Tejero, Isabel M; Garcia-Villaran, Miguel A; Santos-Peña, Marta; Maza-Solano, Juan M; Martín-Jimenez, Daniel I; Palacios-Garcia, Jose M; Fernandez-Velez, Carlos; Gonzalez-Garcia, Jaime; Sanchez-Calvo, Juan M; Solanellas-Soler, Juan; Sanchez-Gomez, Serafin",J Clin Med,363,14

Given the wide range of symptoms, emergency physicians must maintain a broad differential diagnosis in the evaluation and treatment of patients presenting with influenza-like illnesses. OBJECTIVE: This review addresses objective and subjective symptoms commonly associated with influenza and discusses important mimics of influenza viruses, while offering a practical approach to their clinical evaluation and treatment. DISCUSSION: Influenza-like symptoms are common in the emergency department (ED), and influenza accounts for > 200,000 hospitalizations annually. The three predominant types are A, B, and C, and these viruses are commonly transmitted through aerosolized viral particles with a wide range of symptoms. The most reliable means of identifying influenza in the ED is rapid antigen detection, although consideration of local prevalence is required. High-risk populations include children younger than 4 years, adults older than 50 years, adults with immunosuppression or chronic comorbidities, pregnancy, obesity, residents of long-term care facilities, and several others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors in these populations. However, up to 70% of patients with these symptoms may have a mimic. These mimics include infectious and noninfectious sources. The emergency physician must be aware of life-threatening mimics and assess for these conditions while beginning resuscitation and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The wide range of symptoms associated with influenza overlap with several life-threatening conditions. Emergency physicians must be able to rapidly identify patients at risk for complications and those who require immediate resuscitation.","Simon, Erica; Long, Brit; Koyfman, Alex",J Emerg Med,363,7

To this end, the study employs an asymmetric Fourier causality test for the period of January 15, 2020 to May 4, 2020. The outcomes indicate that positive shocks in COVID-19 deaths cause negative shocks in PM(2.5) emissions for New York, San Diego, and San Jose. Moreover, in terms of cases, positive shocks in COVID-19 cause negative shocks in PM(2.5) emissions for Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, Philadelphia, San Antonio, and San Jose. Overall, the findings of the study highlight that the pandemic reduces environmental pressure in the largest cities of the USA. This implies that one of the rare positive effects of the virus is to reduce air pollution. Therefore, for a better environment, US citizens should review the impact of current production and consumption activities on anthropogenic environmental problems.","Pata, Ugur Korkut",Air Qual Atmos Health,363,1
