Traditionally, qualifying the aetiology of CAP proved to be fraught with challenges particularly due to low yields from blood and sputum specimens. In recent years however, new advances in techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction have dramatically improved detection rates of both bacteria and viruses. In addition to qualifying the true burden of disease by known organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae it has led to the identification of organisms such as human bocavirus which have not previously been associated with CAP. This article aims to provide a brief update to the clinician on the current epidemiology of CAP in this post-vaccination era. It is based on a combination of recommendations from existing clinical practice guidelines, recent systematic reviews and the current literature.","Manikam, Logan; Lakhanpaul, Monica",Paediatr Child Health (Oxford),687,1

Although not approved for these indications, the new BetaLactam-BetaLactamase Inhibitor combinations (BLBLIs) could represent a valid salvage treatment. We describe one nosocomial meningitis and two cervical osteomyelitis due to an XDR-PA who were treated with ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA) and ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) and review the literature. METHODS: The first and the third patients developed an osteomyelitis following cervical stabilization surgery due to an XDR-PA. Although the first patient started treatment with a high dose of C/T, resistance to C/T occurred, so therapy was switched to CZA plus aztreonam. The third patient switched to aztreonam plus CZA due to development of acute kidney injury during therapy with colistin. The second patient had an XDR-PA meningitis following the insertion of an external ventricular catheter and he was treated with C/T plus meropenem and amikacin. RESULTS: All three cases reported were successfully conservatively treated thanks to the use of the new BLBLIs with different combinations. Only few experiences demonstrated an equally favorable outcome: one patient treated with C/T plus fosfomycin for otogenic meningitis caused by an XDR-PA and another case of XDR-PA post-surgical meningitis with CZA in combination with colistin. Finally, the combination of CZA plus aztreonam has proven to be effective on XDR-PA only in limited mostly in vitro studies. CONCLUSION: These recently developed antibiotics, C/T and CZA are promising and complementary therapy options against post-neurosurgical hard-to-treat P. aeruginosa infections. Further prospective real-life studies are required to validate these findings in this special setting.","Meschiari, Marianna; Franconi, Iacopo; Bacca, Erica; Bianco, Vincenzo; Orlando, Gabriella; Cuomo, Gianluca; Bedini, Andrea; Mussini, Cristina",Infection,687,16

The influence of the infrastructure of NICUs on NIs is not well documented. This study aims to examine the effect of single-room units (SRU) versus open-bay units (OBU) on the incidence of NIs, including central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), in preterm neonates. METHODS: All preterm neonates (< 32 weeks gestational age) admitted to our NICU were included. Two study periods were compared: one prior to (May 2015–May 2017) and one following (May 2017–May 2019) transition from OBU to SRU. Incidence density (number of infections per 1000 patient-days) and cumulative incidence (number of infections per 100 neonates) for NIs were calculated. CLABSIs were calculated per 1000 central-line days. U chart analysis was performed to determine special-cause variation in quarterly CLABSI and NI rates. Multivariate competing risk regression was performed to identify independent NI risk factors. RESULTS: Of the 712 included infants, 164 (23%) infants acquired ≥ 1 NIs. No differences were found in incidence density (13.68 vs. 12.62, p = 0.62) or cumulative incidence of NI (23.97 vs. 22.02, p = 0.59) between OBU and SRU. CLABSIs showed a similar non-significant reduction after the move (14.00 vs. 10.59, p = 0.51). U chart analysis did not identify unit transition as a potential source of special-cause variation for CLABSI and NI. Competing risks regression analysis revealed longer duration of invasive mechanical ventilation as a significant risk factor for NI (subhazards ratio: 1.03 per day on ventilation, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Single-rooms are not associated with a significant reduction in NIs in the NICU. This study therefore does not add evidence that could support the transition to SRUs if based only on a large multimodal infection control strategy. Recommendations to build SRUs would require a wider justification, also taking into account other SRU benefits.

OBJECTIVE To describe components of obstructive upper airway syndrome in a nonbrachycephalic terrier breed. ANIMALS Sixteen Norwich Terriers; 12 with and 4 without clinical signs of respiratory disease. METHODS Prospective case series. Physical and laryngoscopic examinations were performed by 1 investigator in all dogs. Medical and surgical interventions were summarized and results of follow-up examination or owner reports were recorded. RESULTS The study population was comprised of 9 females (6 intact) and 7 males (5 intact). Median age was 3.0 years (range, 0.5-11 years). Of 12 dogs presented for a respiratory complaint, physical examination was normal in 4 dogs. Laryngoscopic examination was abnormal in 11/12 dogs with redundant supra-arytenoid folds, laryngeal collapse, everted laryngeal saccules, and a narrowed laryngeal opening in most. Of 4 dogs lacking clinical signs, all had normal physical examination; however, 3/4 dogs had similar appearance of the larynx to dogs with clinical signs. Response to surgical intervention was minimal to moderate in all dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Norwich Terriers suffer from an upper airway obstructive syndrome that differs from that encountered in brachycephalic breeds. Affected dogs are difficult to identify without laryngoscopic examination because of the lack of clinical signs and abnormalities in physical examination findings, despite severe airway obstruction. Care is warranted when anesthetizing Norwich Terriers because of the small size of the laryngeal opening.","Johnson, L R; Mayhew, P D; Steffey, M A; Hunt, G B; Carr, A H; McKiernan, B C",Journal of veterinary internal medicine,687,1

Effective screening methods are awaited. We performed a prospective study to evaluate the impact of musculature and breathing-swallowing discoordination on the exacerbation of COPD with a novel swallowing monitor using a piezoelectric sensor. Patients and Methods This was the second part of a prospective study of patients with COPD from the Iizuka COPD cohort. Seventy patients with stable COPD underwent dysphagia screening, skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) and tongue pressure measurements, and swallowed 3 mL and 30 mL of water while wearing a swallowing monitor. Patients were followed for one year. Results During the follow-up period, 28 patients experienced exacerbations (E group), and 42 had none (non-E group). There was no significant difference in tongue pressure measurements between the two groups. The SMI in the E group was significantly lower than that in the non-E group. Among the swallowing monitor measurements, the 3 mL I-SW% (the percentage of swallows in which inspiration preceded the swallow [out of ten 3 mL swallows]) was significantly lower in the E group than in the non-E group. Conclusion Breathing-swallowing coordination is an independent factor related to the exacerbation of COPD. Not only the presence of discoordination but also the inability to produce an airway protection mechanism may contribute to more frequent aspiration and exacerbations.","Yoshimatsu, Yuki; Tobino, Kazunori; Nagami, Shinsuke; Yagi, Naomi; Oku, Yoshitaka",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,687,33

Natural exon skipping observed in several DMD cases can help in identifying novel therapeutic tools. Here, we show a DMD study case where the lack of a splicing factor (Celf2a), which results in exon skipping and dystrophin rescue, is due to a maternally inherited trans-generational epigenetic silencing. We found that the study case and his mother express a repressive long non-coding RNA, DUXAP8, whose presence correlates with silencing of the Celf2a coding region. We also demonstrate that DUXAP8 expression is lost upon cell reprogramming and that, upon induction of iPSCs into myoblasts, Celf2a expression is recovered leading to the loss of exon skipping and loss of dystrophin synthesis. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9 inactivation of the splicing factor Celf2a was proven to ameliorate the pathological state in other DMD backgrounds establishing Celf2a ablation or inactivation as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.","Martone, Julie; Lisi, Michela; Castagnetti, Francesco; Rosa, Alessandro; Di Carlo, Valerio; Blanco, Enrique; Setti, Adriano; Mariani, Davide; Colantoni, Alessio; Santini, Tiziana; Perone, Lucia; Di Croce, Luciano; Bozzoni, Irene",EMBO molecular medicine,687,30

Despite extensive study, a cellular receptor for the deadly filoviruses Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus has yet to be identified and characterized. Here, we show that T-cell Ig and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) binds to the receptor binding domain of the Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein, and ectopic TIM-1 expression in poorly permissive cells enhances EBOV infection by 10- to 30-fold. Conversely, reduction of cell-surface expression of TIM-1 by RNAi decreased infection of highly permissive Vero cells. TIM-1 expression within the human body is broader than previously appreciated, with expression on mucosal epithelia from the trachea, cornea, and conjunctiva--tissues believed to be important during in vivo transmission of filoviruses. Recognition that TIM-1 serves as a receptor for filoviruses on these mucosal epithelial surfaces provides a mechanistic understanding of routes of entry into the human body via inhalation of aerosol particles or hand-to-eye contact. ARD5, a monoclonal antibody against the IgV domain of TIM-1, blocked EBOV binding and infection, suggesting that antibodies or small molecules directed against this cellular receptor may provide effective filovirus antivirals.","Kondratowicz, Andrew S; Lennemann, Nicholas J; Sinn, Patrick L; Davey, Robert A; Hunt, Catherine L; Moller-Tank, Sven; Meyerholz, David K; Rennert, Paul; Mullins, Robert F; Brindley, Melinda; Sandersfeld, Lindsay M; Quinn, Kathrina; Weller, Melodie; McCray, Paul B; Chiorini, John; Maury, Wendy",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,687,1

METHODS Data were retrospectively extracted from all women who underwent RSC between May 1, 2009 and December 31, 2011 by a single urogynecologist with fellow and resident assistance. Patient demographics, operative times, intraoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and postoperative course were analyzed. Cases were grouped chronologically in blocks of 10 for analysis. Trend analysis of operative time was done with linear and negative binomial regression. Fisher's exact test was used to compare complications among blocks. RESULTS Fifty-two patients (mean age 58.5±8.4 years) underwent RSC. The majority (75%) had stage III prolapse. Forty-one patients (79%) had concomitant procedures, including supracervical hysterectomy (44%), bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (9.6%), midurethral sling (9.6%), and lysis of adhesions (40.4%). There was no trend toward decreased operative time with increased surgical experience (linear regression P=.453, negative binomial regression P=.998). Mean operative time was 301.1±53.1 minutes (range 205-440). Overall complication rate was not associated with number of robotic cases performed (P=.771). Nine cases (17.3%) were converted to laparotomy. Five of these occurred in the first 15 cases. There were 2 bladder injuries (3.8%) and no bowel injuries. CONCLUSIONS Although a learning curve was not demonstrated, the adoption of RSC into a urogynecology fellowship program yields similar rates of bladder/bowel injuries, postoperative complications, and operative times when compared with other published studies.","Bradley, Megan S; Kantartzis, Kelly L; Lowder, Jerry L; Winger, Dan; Wang, Li; Shepherd, Jonathan P",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,687,17

Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used for typing of BoLA-A exon 2-3 with DdeI and TaqI restriction enzymes; and exon 4-5 with HinfI in 45 crossbred calves. The PCR-RFLP analysis revealed five BoLA-A alleles each for exon 2-3 (A10/A19, A19, A18/19, A18 and A31) and exon 4-5 (A, B, C, D and E). Immune response against B. abortus S19 was assessed at the 4th week post vaccination; antibody response by standard tube agglutination test (STAT) and cell-mediated immunity by lymphocyte proliferation and lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity assays. Further, the macrophage function in terms of nitrite production was also analyzed. The association analysis of various BoLA-A alleles with the elicitation of immune response revealed that calves with certain defined genotypes induced significantly higher cell-mediated immune response in terms of lymphocyte proliferation with higher stimulation indices (S.I.) of 1.59 (BoLA-A19), 1.49 (A18/19) and 1.52 (HinfI-D); lymphocyte mediated cytotoxicity (55.52 % in A19) and nitrite production (43.40 μM in A31). It is assumed that allelic variants of BoLA-A (exons 2-3 and 4-5) were associated with the differential immune response of calves to B. abortus S19 vaccination. Therefore, further studies on association analysis of MHC class-I genes in large number of cattle may generate more information and might be useful for adapting the alternative approach of exploring genetic resistance in the cattle herd against bovine brucellosis.","Patra, Biswanath; Panigrahi, Manjit; Ahmad, Sheikh Firdous; Dandapat, Satyabrata; Kumar, Pushpendra; Bhushan, Bharat",Veterinary microbiology,687,22

This scoping review was undertaken to identify complexity measures/tools used in rheumatology that could help in planning and coordinating care. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched from database inception to 14 December 2019 using keywords and Medical Subject Headings for ""care coordination"", ""complexity"" and selected rheumatic diseases and known complexity measures/tools. Articles describing the development or use of complexity measures/tools in patients with adult rheumatologic diagnoses were included regardless of study design. Included articles were evaluated for risk of bias where applicable. RESULTS The search yielded 407 articles, 37 underwent full-text review and 2 were identified during a hand search with 9 included articles. Only 2 complexity tools used in populations of adult patients with rheumatic disease were identified: the SLENQ and the INTERMED. The SLENQ is a 97-item patient needs questionnaire developed for patients with systemic lupus (n = 1 study describing tool development) and applied in 5 cross-sectional studies. Three studies (a practice article, trial and a cross-sectional study) applied the INTERMED, a clinical interview to ascertain complexity and support coordinated care, in patients with rheumatologic diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS There is limited information on the use of patient complexity measures/tools in rheumatology. Such tools could be applied to coordinate multidisciplinary care and improve patient experience and outcomes.

In female patients, breast reconstruction is particularly challenging because of cranial pectoralis muscle defects and partial or complete breast agenesis. Different techniques have been used to treat the thoracic anomaly, including the positioning of an implant, fat transfer or latissimus dorsi transposition, but in some cases these techniques are not feasible resulting in a poor reconstruction. METHODS We present our experience in correction of the chest anomaly of PS in a teenage population by using a pedicled laparoscopically harvested omental flap (LOF) to cover a pectoral or breast prosthesis. Procedures were performed by a surgical team which included experienced plastic surgeons and general paediatric surgeons. Preoperative endocrinological and psychological evaluation helped to determine the best timing for the correction. RESULTS The technique was adopted in 20 patients aged 14-18 years, affected by the syndrome. In all cases, it was possible to harvest an adequate amount of pedicled omentum laparoscopically. Neither significant complications nor conversions to open surgery occurred. The aesthetic outcome of the LOF technique was, in all cases, a soft, natural-looking breast and a satisfactorily corrected infraclavicular defect. CONCLUSIONS The LOF technique is a valid alternative to reconstruction in selected PS cases. It provides a satisfactory reconstruction of the breast and pectoral region and corrects the infraclavicular defect by filling in the area. It avoids the invasiveness and morbidity of a latissimus dorsi transposition.","Romanini, M V; Vidal, C; Godoy, J; Morovic, C G","Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",687,16

Previous studies have suggested significant declines in cases of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We performed a quasi-experimental, retrospective cohort study of ACS hospitalisations by using a multi-institutional administrative claims database in Japan. We used interrupted time series analyses to ascertain impacts on cases, treatment approaches, and in-hospital mortality before and after Japan's state of emergency to respond to COVID-19. The primary outcome was the change in ACS cases per week. RESULTS A total of 30,198 ACS cases (including 21,612 acute myocardial infarction and 8,586 unstable angina) were confirmed between 1st July 2018 and 30th June 2020. After the state of emergency, an immediate decrease was observed in ACS cases per week (-18.3%; 95% confidence interval, -13.1 to -23.5%).

OBJECTIVE To assess the time-outcome relationship within reperfusion grades in the North American Solitaire Acute Stroke registry. METHODS We identified patients given ET for anterior circulation ischemic stroke within 8 h from onset and in whom reperfusion was achieved. Together with clinical and outcome data, site-adjudicated modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia (TICI) was recorded. We assessed the impact of time to reperfusion (onset to procedure completion time) on good outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-2 at 3 months) in patients who achieved TICI 2 or higher reperfusion in multivariable models. We further assessed this relationship within strata of reperfusion grades. A p<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Independent predictors of good outcome at 3 months among those achieving TICI ≥2a reperfusion (n=188) were initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (adjusted OR=0.90, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.95), symptomatic hemorrhage (adj. OR=0.16, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.60), TICI grade (TICI 3: adj. OR=11.52, 95% CI 3.34 to 39.77; TICI 2b: adj. OR=5.14, 95% CI 1.61 to 16.39), and time to reperfusion per 30 min interval (adj. OR=0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99). There was an interaction between final TICI grade and 30 min time to reperfusion intervals (p=0.001) such that the effect of time was strongest in TICI 2a patients. CONCLUSIONS Time to reperfusion was a strong predictor of outcome following ET for AIS. However, the effect varied by TICI grade such that its greatest effect was in those achieving TICI 2a reperfusion.","Prabhakaran, Shyam; Castonguay, Alicia C; Gupta, Rishi; Sun, Chung-Huan J; Martin, Coleman O; Holloway, William; Mueller-Kronast, Nils H; English, Joey; Linfante, Italo; Dabus, Guilherme; Malisch, Tim; Marden, Franklin; Bozorgchami, Hormozd; Xavier, Andrew; Rai, Ansaar; Froehler, Michael; Badruddin, Aamir; Taqi, Mohammad Asif; Novakovic, Roberta; Abraham, Michael; Janardhan, Vallabh; Shaltoni, Hashem; Yoo, Albert J; Abou-Chebl, Alex; Chen, Peng; Britz, Gavin; Kaushal, Ritesh; Nanda, Ashish; Nogueira, Raul; Nguyen, Thanh; Zaidat, Osama O",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,687,19

In many low- and middle-income countries, inadequate surveillance and incompleteness of death registration are important barriers. DESIGN Here, we characterize how large an impact on mortality would have to be to be detectable using the uniquely detailed mortality notification data from the city of Antananarivo, Madagascar, with application to a recent measles outbreak. RESULTS The weekly mortality rate of children during the 2018-2019 measles outbreak was 161% above the expected value at its peak, and the signal can be detected earlier in children than in the general population. This approach to detecting anomalies from expected baseline mortality allows us to delineate the prevalence of COVID-19 at which excess mortality would be detectable with the existing death notification system in Antananarivo. CONCLUSIONS Given current age-specific estimates of the COVID-19 fatality ratio and the age structure of the population in Antananarivo, we estimate that as few as 11 deaths per week in the 60-70 years age group (corresponding to an infection rate of approximately 1%) would detectably exceed the baseline. Data from 2020 will undergo necessary processing and quality control in the coming months. Our results provide a baseline for interpreting this information.","Rasambainarivo, Fidisoa; Rasoanomenjanahary, Anjarasoa; Rabarison, Joelinotahiana Hasina; Ramiadantsoa, Tanjona; Ratovoson, Rila; Randremanana, Rindra; Randrianarisoa, Santatriniaina; Rajeev, Malavika; Masquelier, Bruno; Heraud, Jean Michel; Metcalf, C Jessica E; Rice, Benjamin L",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,687,20

A positive QF result identifies patients that are better protected against CMV infection. However, the significance of a negative QF result in CMV-seropositive individuals needs to be clarified. CMV-CMI was analyzed in healthy subjects using the QF assay, and, in parallel, the Flow-cytometric Assay of Specific Cell-mediated Immune response in Activated whole blood (FASCIA). FASCIA assay measures T-cell proliferation using CMV lysate as stimulus whereas QF assay use a mix of peptides. A total of 93 healthy volunteers were enrolled, and 13/71 CMV-seropositive individuals (18.3%) showed humoral/cellular discordance using QF assay (CMV+ QF-). Interestingly, with FASCIA assay CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proliferations were lower in CMV+ QF- than in CMV+ QF+ individuals. Furthermore, CMV+ QF- volunteers had a lower level of anti-CMV IgG than CMV+ QF+ subjects. Discordant CMV+ QF- volunteers can be defined as low responder individuals since they show lower CMV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in comparison to CMV+ QF+ individuals. Immune discordance shows the high heterogeneity of immunity to CMV in healthy subjects.","Valle-Arroyo, Jorge; Aguado, Rocío; Páez-Vega, Aurora; Pérez, Ana B; González, Rafael; Fornés, Gema; Torre-Cisneros, Julián; Cantisán, Sara",Scientific reports,687,16

Accurate screening and diagnosis of gestational diabetes are critical to treatment, and in a pandemic scenario like coronavirus disease 2019 needing a simple test that minimises prolonged hospital stay. We undertook a meta-analysis on the screening and diagnostic accuracy of the haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test in women with and without risk factors for gestational diabetes. RECENT FINDINGS Unlike the oral glucose tolerance test, the HbA1c test is simple, quick and more acceptable. There is a growing body of evidence on the accuracy of HbA1c as a screening and diagnostic test for GDM. We searched Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library and selected relevant studies. Accuracy data for different thresholds within the final 23 included studies (16 921 women) were pooled using a multiple thresholds model. Summary accuracy indices were estimated by selecting an optimal threshold that optimises either sensitivity or specificity according to different scenarios. SUMMARY HbA1c is more useful as a specific test at a cut-off of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) with a false positive rate of 10%, but should be supplemented by a more sensitive test to detect women with GDM.","Amaefule, Chiamaka Esther; Sasitharan, Archana; Kalra, Princee; Iliodromoti, Stamatina; Huda, Mohammed S B; Rogozinska, Ewelina; Zamora, Javier; Thangaratinam, Shakila",Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,687,9

This model is intended to serve as a teaching tool during the introduction to, and development of, the skills required to perform a thoracoscopic intrathoracic anastomosis during an Ivor Lewis minimally invasive esophagectomy. METHODS The simulation model uses porcine tissue placed within an artificial hemithorax and covered with a synthetic skin. The model is draped to simulate a realistic operative setting, and ports are placed in standard surgical fashion. Dissection of the esophagus from the mediastinum is then performed, followed by the creation of an esophagogastric anastomosis. The effectiveness of the training model was evaluated using volunteer general and thoracic surgery residents at varying stages of surgical training. The quality of the anastomoses created were evaluated using both objective and subjective criteria, and successful anastomoses were tested for leaks using hydrostatic pressure. RESULTS Objective evaluation showed that successful completion of the anastomosis task increased with the number of attempts, with 100% of participants successfully completing an anastomosis by the final attempt. The time to completion of a successful anastomosis also improved across successive attempts. Moreover, objective measures also showed improvement over time based on the graded quality of the completed anastomosis. CONCLUSION As surgical techniques continue to evolve, so must the means by which they are taught. This simulation model shows effectiveness in the training of general and thoracic surgery residents performing thoracoscopic intrathoracic anastomosis during the Ivor Lewis minimally invasive esophagectomy.","Fabian, Thomas; Glotzer, Owen S; Bakhos, Charles T",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,687,16

Stress can influence the ability to focus, study, and may delay continuation in graduate school. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to identify the stressors of graduate nursing students during the pandemic. METHOD A prospective, descriptive, online survey design was used to identify graduate nursing student stressors during the pandemic at one educational institution in the United States. Questions related to employment, COVID-19 exposure, institutional support, future graduate plans were summarized for the total sample and stratified by program (MS, DNP, PhD). Changes in a total stress score were evaluated pre and post onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS A total of 222 graduate nursing students completed the survey. The vast majority of students were employed before the pandemic and a significant decrease in employment occurred during the pandemic (97.3% to 90.1%, p < .001). Overall stress increased (p < .001). The increased total stress was associated with students participating in clinical rotations (q = 0.024) and having a change in work hours (q = 0.022).

In this study, we develop a network-based methodology, termed meta-path-based Disease Network (mpDisNet) capturing algorithm, to infer disease-disease relationships by assembling four biological networks: disease-miRNA, miRNA-gene, disease-gene, and the human protein-protein interactome. mpDisNet is a meta-path-based random walk to reconstruct the heterogeneous neighbors of a given node. mpDisNet uses a heterogeneous skip-gram model to solve the network representation of the nodes. We find that mpDisNet reveals high performance in inferring clinically reported disease-disease relationships, outperforming that of traditional gene/miRNA-overlap approaches. In addition, mpDisNet identifies network-based comorbidities for pulmonary diseases driven by underlying miRNA-mediated pathobiological pathways (i.e., hsa-let-7a- or hsa-let-7b-mediated airway epithelial apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine pathways) as derived from the human interactome network analysis. The mpDisNet offers a powerful tool for network-based identification of disease-disease relationships with miRNA-mediated pathobiological pathways.","Jin, Shuting; Zeng, Xiangxiang; Fang, Jiansong; Lin, Jiawei; Chan, Stephen Y; Erzurum, Serpil C; Cheng, Feixiong",NPJ systems biology and applications,687,24

Intraoperative application of TTE is feasible, but its benefits remain unclear. The intention of this study was to investigate the effect of intraoperative TTE on the management of high-risk noncardiac surgery patients. DESIGN A prospective interventional study. SETTING Single-center university hospital. PARTICIPANTS Fifty consecutive hemodynamically unstable high-risk patients anesthetized for noncardiac surgery. INTERVENTIONS Focused TTE was performed on hemodynamically unstable anesthetized patients whenever circulatory instability (defined as hypotension or low cardiac output) occurred intraoperatively. A cardiac output monitoring system using pulse contour analysis was established before induction of anesthesia. The intended therapy for stabilizing the patient was documented; however, the management actually administered was guided by the results of the TTE. Differences between the 2 lines of management were documented and analyzed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Intraoperative TTE was applied successfully in all 50 unstable patients. In 33 patients (66%, 95% confidence interval, 52.11-77.61) TTE led to a change of management. Altogether, 82 episodes of hemodynamic instability were recorded, including 38 episodes (46.34%, 95% confidence interval, 35.95-57.06) in which TTE led to a change of treatment. The most common pathologic finding was hypovolemia (66%); in contrast, in 22%, right-heart overload or right-heart failure (4%) was detected. CONCLUSIONS Focused TTE by anesthesiologists can provide new information that may alter the hemodynamic management of unstable high-risk noncardiac surgery patients in the operating room.","Kratz, Thomas; Steinfeldt, Thorsten; Exner, Maik; Dell Orto, Marco Campo; Timmesfeld, Nina; Kratz, Caroline; Skrodzki, Martin; Wulf, Hinnerk; Zoremba, Martin",Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,687,5

BACKGROUND At present we do not know if published reports of guideline implementations in trauma settings are of sufficient quality to facilitate replication by other centers wishing to implement the same or similar guidelines. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was conducted. Articles were identified through electronic databases and hand searching relevant trauma journals. Studies meeting inclusion criteria focused on a guideline, protocol, or algorithm that targeted adult trauma patients ≥18 years and/or trauma patient care providers, and evaluated the effectiveness of guideline, protocol, or algorithm implementation in terms of change in clinical practice or patient outcomes. Each included study was assessed in duplicate for adherence to the 18-item SQUIRE 2.0 criteria. The primary endpoint was the proportion of studies meeting at least 80% (score ≥15) of SQUIRE 2.0. RESULTS Of 7368 screened studies, 74 met inclusion criteria. Thirty-nine percent of studies scored ≥80% on SQUIRE 2.0. Criteria that were met most frequently were abstract (93%), problem description (93%), and specific aims (89%).

Technical difficulties have made the use of the minimally invasive approach uncommon. Herein, we present a subtotal pancreas-preserving duodenectomy using robotic assistance. METHODS The patient is a 60-y-old female with a long medical history including chronic gastrointestinal bleeding due to angiodysplasia with intermittent melena, and requiring multiples blood transfusions. A capsule endoscopy and double-balloon upper endoscopy showed angiectasis, which appeared to be limited to the third and fourth portion of the duodenum and the proximal loops of the jejunum. Despite multiple endoscopic cauterizations, the patient continued to require blood transfusion for several years. The patient underwent a robot-assisted subtotal pancreas-preserving duodenectomy. RESULTS The operation lasted 420 min with minimal blood loss. The postoperative course was uneventful. The pathology report showed multiple small bowel mucosal and submucosal distorted and dilated vasculature, consistent with angiodysplasia. At 2-mo follow-up, the patient was totally asymptomatic. A barium swallow study showed contrast passed antegrade through the duodenojejunostomy with no evidence of obstruction, stricture, or leakage. CONCLUSION The use of robotic assistance to perform a subtotal pancreas-preserving duodenectomy for the treatment of benign duodenal disease, such as angiodysplasia, is feasible and safe. The technical advantages include a high degree of freedom offered by the robotic instruments, as well as enhanced visualization, which allows for precise microdissection and microsuture, thereby preserving the benefits of minimally invasive surgery. The use of robotic technology allows for a wider range of indications for minimally invasive surgery.","Masrur, Mario; Gheza, Federico; Raimondi, Paolo; D'Ugo, Stefano; Calatayud, David; Giulianotti, Pier C",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,687,31

The use of anti PD-1, anti PD-L1, and anti CTLA-4 antibodies is rapidly expanding. The side effects of ICIs are very different from conventional cytocidal anticancer and molecular target drugs, and may extend to the digestive organs, respiratory organs, thyroid gland, pituitary gland, skin, and others. Although the details of these adverse events are becoming increasingly apparent, much is unknown regarding the effects and adverse events related to infections. This review focuses specifically on the impact of ICIs on respiratory infections. The impact of ICIs on pathogens varies depending on the significance of the role of T-cell immunity in the immune response to the specific pathogen, as well as the different modes of infection (i.e., acute or chronic), although the impact of ICIs on the clinical outcome of infections in humans has not yet been well studied. Enhanced clearance of many pathogens has been shown because immune checkpoint inhibition activates T cells. In contrast, reactivation of tuberculosis associated with ICI use has been reported, and therefore caution is warranted. In COVID-19 pneumonia, ICI administration may lead to exacerbation; however, it is also possible that ICI may be used for the treatment of COVID-19. It has also been shown that ICI has potential in the treatment of intractable filamentous fungal infections. Therefore, expanded clinical applications are expected.","Hamashima, Ryosuke; Uchino, Junji; Morimoto, Yoshie; Iwasaku, Masahiro; Kaneko, Yoshiko; Yamada, Tadaaki; Takayama, Koichi",Cancer treatment reviews,687,20

Our objective was to describe the anatomical characteristics of the acromial and coracoid process using computed tomography (CT). METHODS Descriptive, observational, transversal and retrospective study. A total of 155 CT of patients without shoulder pathology, of both genders, and indistinct age were evaluated and grouped by age: Group 1 < 25 years; group 2 25-40 years; group 3 > 40 years. The following parameters were evaluated: Acromial type (AcT), vertical coracoid distance (VCD), acromial tilt (AT), acromial projection (AP), critical shoulder angle (CSA), type of the subcoracoid outlet (TSO), and the area of the subcoracoid outlet (ASO). RESULTS Statistically significant differences were found between men and women for VCD (14.44 ± 4.79 vs. 11.76 ± 4.00 mm; p < 0.001) and AP (3.66 ± 4.71 vs. 1.62 ± 4.99 mm; p < 0.05) as well as between age groups 1 and 3 for AT (35.08 ± 11.53 vs. 28.41 ± 6.60; p < 0.05) and ASO (398.99 ± 153.91 vs. 255.56 ± 124.58 mm2; p < 0.001).

However, due to the disruption of established delivery chains, standard assays for in vitro diagnostics of those cancers were temporarily not available, forcing us to implement alternative testing methods that enabled at least basic therapy decision making. For this reason, we evaluated rapid testing on the Biocartis Idylla™ platform (Biocartis, Mechelen, Belgium) for four important genes commonly mutated in lung and colorectal cancers, namely EGFR, NRAS, KRAS, and BRAF. Clinical specimens from which the mutation status has previously been determined using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), were retested to determine whether Idylla™ can offer accurate results. To compare the results, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) are calculated for each of the mutation types and then combined to determine the values of the Idylla™ system in total, while setting NGS as the gold-standard basis the assays were compared with.

METHOD A systematic search strategy was developed and a rigorous search of the literature was undertaken searching six databases (CINAHL, Embase, Medline, Psych Info, Ethos and Proquest). The software for systematic reviews www.covidence.org was used to blind screen for eligible papers. Quality appraisal of each study was undertaken using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). Confidence in each finding was assessed using Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (CERQual). RESULTS Eight qualitative studies (reported in eleven papers and including seventy six myeloma patients) were selected in the final sample for evidence synthesis. Four themes were identified relating to patients' feeling 'dead', disconnecting and isolating themselves, cognitive impairment and engagement with exercise and its benefits in recovery. CONCLUSIONS The burden of cognitive functioning among myeloma patients was often under detected. Nurses should ask patients regularly about their memory and any challenges they may be experiencing to their concentration and recall, Exercise during the transplant process can help improve patients' recovery, both physically and psychologically. A structured exercise programme developed by a physiotherapist to suit the needs of each patient should be standard practice in the transplant process.","Walpole, Geraldine; Clark, Helen; Dowling, Maura",European journal of oncology nursing : the official journal of European Oncology Nursing Society,687,1

In this study, we aimed to identify the pattern of local transmission of COVID-19 using mathematical modeling and predict the epidemic size and the timing of the end of the spread. Methods We modeled the COVID-19 outbreak in the Republic of Korea by applying a mathematical model of transmission that factors in behavioral changes. We used the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data of daily confirmed cases in the country to estimate the nationwide and Daegu/Gyeongbuk area-specific transmission rates as well as behavioral change parameters using a least-squares method. Results The number of transmissions per infected patient was estimated to be about 10 times higher in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area than the average of nationwide. Using these estimated parameters, our models predicts that about 13,800 cases will occur nationwide and 11,400 cases in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area until mid-June. Conclusion We mathematically demonstrate that the relatively high per-capita rate of transmission and the low rate of changes in behavior have caused a large-scale transmission of COVID-19 in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area in the Republic of Korea. Since the outbreak is expected to continue until May, nonpharmaceutical interventions that can be sustained over the long term are required.","Kim, Soyoung; Seo, Yu Bin; Jung, Eunok",Epidemiology and health,687,12

We aimed to explore the risk of death in minority ethnic groups in England using data reported by NHS England. Methods: We used NHS data on patients with a positive COVID-19 test who died in hospitals in England published on 28th April, with deaths by ethnicity available from 1st March 2020 up to 5pm on 21 April 2020. We undertook indirect standardisation of these data (using the whole population of England as the reference) to produce ethnic specific standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) adjusted for age and geographical region. Results: The largest total number of deaths in minority ethnic groups were Indian (492 deaths) and Black Caribbean (460 deaths) groups. Adjusting for region we found a lower risk of death for White Irish (SMR 0.52; 95%CIs 0.45-0.60) and White British ethnic groups (0.88; 95%CIs 0.86-0.0.89), but increased risk of death for Black African (3.24; 95%CIs 2.90-3.62), Black Caribbean (2.21; 95%CIs 2.02-2.41), Pakistani (3.29; 95%CIs 2.96-3.64), Bangladeshi (2.41; 95%CIs 1.98-2.91) and Indian (1.70; 95%CIs 1.56-1.85) minority ethnic groups. Conclusion: Our analysis adds to the evidence that BAME people are at increased risk of death from COVID-19 even after adjusting for geographical region, but was limited by the lack of data on deaths outside of NHS settings and ethnicity denominator data being based on the 2011 census. Despite these limitations, we believe there is an urgent need to take action to reduce the risk of death for BAME groups and better understand why some ethnic groups experience greater risk. Actions that are likely to reduce these inequities include ensuring adequate income protection, reducing occupational risks, reducing barriers in accessing healthcare and providing culturally and linguistically appropriate public health communications.","Aldridge, Robert W; Lewer, Dan; Katikireddi, Srinivasa Vittal; Mathur, Rohini; Pathak, Neha; Burns, Rachel; Fragaszy, Ellen B; Johnson, Anne M; Devakumar, Delan; Abubakar, Ibrahim; Hayward, Andrew",Wellcome open research,687,1

Our aim was to assess the diagnostic accuracy (correlation, agreement, and trending) of continuous distal capnography (dCap) with PaCO2 in infants ventilated with HFV. DESIGN This was a prospective, observational, multicenter study. dCap was compared with simultaneous PaCO2 (""gold standard"") drawn from indwelling arterial line for patient care in term and preterm infants ventilated with HFV. dCap was obtained via the side-port of a double-lumen endotracheal-tube by a Microstream capnograph with specially designed software for HFV. RESULTS Twenty-four infants participated in the study (median [range] gestational age [GA]: 26.8 [23.6-38.6] weeks). Analysis included 332 measurements. dCap was in correlation (r = 0.70, P < 0.001) but with less than adequate agreement (mean difference ± SD of the differences: -11.7 ± 10.3 mmHg) with PaCO2 . Comparable findings were found in the subgroup of infants <1,000 g (n = 240 measurements). Correlations were maintained in severe lung disease. Changes in dCap and in PaCO2 for consecutive measurements within each patient were correlated (r = 0.63, P < 0.001). Area under the receiver operating curves (ROC) for dCap to detect high (>60 mmHg) or low (<30 mmHg) PaCO2 was 0.83 (CI: 0.76-0.90) and 0.88 (CI: 0.79-0.97), respectively; P < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS Our prospective study suggests that continuous dCap in infants ventilated with HFV may be helpful for trends and alarm for unsafe levels of PaCO2 . dCap is only a complimentary tool and cannot replace PaCO2 sampling because the agreement between these measurements was less than adequate.","Kugelman, Amir; Bromiker, Ruben; Riskin, Arieh; Shoris, Irit; Ronen, Michal; Qumqam, Nelly; Bader, David; Golan, Agenta",Pediatric pulmonology,687,31

The high prevalence of infectious diseases in South Africa means that these workers and family members of deceased individuals are vulnerable to infection if proper safety measures and equipment are not used. OBJECTIVES To collect observational information on funeral industry practices in order to assess the safety of handling corpses and exposure to risk that could result in disease transmission. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted across two locations from August to October 2015. Funeral homes in Klerksdorp and Soweto were approached. The study team did facility assessments and observed preparation practices, focusing on safety equipment, personal protective equipment (PPE) and contact with hazardous materials. Interviews with funeral home personnel and relatives of the deceased were also conducted. RESULTS Of the funeral homes, 23.0% (20/87) agreed to participate. A median of 5 personnel (interquartile range 4 - 8) were employed per facility. It was observed that not all PPE was used despite availability. Gloves, aprons and face masks were most commonly worn, and no personnel were observed wearing boots, gowns or plastic sleeves. Funeral homes were located near food outlets, schools and open public spaces, and not all had access to proper biohazardous waste disposal services. Of 5 family members who were interviewed for the study, none reported being willing to partake in the funeral preparation procedure. CONCLUSIONS There is a need to standardise the use of safety equipment, waste disposal methods and location designation in the funeral industry.","Ringane, A; Milovanovic, M; Maphakula, D; Makete, F; Omar, T; Martinson, N; Lebina, L",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,687,22

The environmental origin of MERS-CoV is as yet unknown; however, its genome sequence is closely related to those of two bat coronaviruses, named BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5, which were derived from Chinese bat samples. A hallmark of highly pathogenic respiratory viruses is their ability to evade the innate immune response of the host. CoV accessory proteins, for example those from severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), have been shown to block innate antiviral signalling pathways. MERS-CoV, similar to SARS-CoV, has been shown to inhibit type I IFN induction in a variety of cell types in vitro. We therefore hypothesized that MERS-CoV and the phylogenetically related BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 may encode proteins with similar capabilities. In this study, we have demonstrated that the ORF4b-encoded accessory protein (p4b) of MERS-CoV, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 may indeed facilitate innate immune evasion by inhibiting the type I IFN and NF-κB signalling pathways. We also analysed the subcellular localization of p4b from MERS-CoV, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 and demonstrated that all are localized to the nucleus.","Matthews, Krystal L; Coleman, Christopher M; van der Meer, Yvonne; Snijder, Eric J; Frieman, Matthew B",The Journal of general virology,687,1

Because the right ovary without edematous swelling was noted adjacent to the cystic mass, isolated tubal torsion was strongly suspected. Emergency gasless laparoendoscopic single-site surgery showed isolated torsion of the right fallopian tube with a paratubal cyst. The right ovary was not involved in this torsion. Because the color tone of the distal portion of the fallopian tube did not recover sufficiently after detorsion, right salpingectomy was performed.

Here, we investigated the relationship between hypertension prevalence and gut microbial composition in two cohorts. METHODS We included 871 unrelated TwinsUK women with faecal microbiome data (16s rRNA gene sequencing). Multivariable linear models adjusted for age, age2 and BMI as well as MiRKAT models, were used to estimate the association of hypertension with alpha- and beta-diversity metrics. To identify taxa associated with hypertension, a generalized additive model for location scale and shape was computed adjusting for covariates and multiple testing. Results were replicated in 448 women from PREDICT-1. RESULTS We found that measures of alpha diversity are significantly lower in hypertensive cases [Beta(95% confidence interval, 95% CI) = -0.05 (-0.095 to -0.004), P = 0.03] and a significant association between beta diversity and hypertension (FDR < 0.05). We identified and replicated two genera associated with hypertension. The genus, Ruminiclostridium 6 was less abundant in hypertension cases [meta-analysis (95% CI) = -0.31 (-0.5 to -0.13), P = 1 × 10-3]. The uncultured microbe Erysipelotrichacea-UCG003 was more abundant in hypertensive cases [meta-analysis (95% CI) = 0.46 (0.3-0.62), P = 1 × 10-4]. We genomically analysed the 16 s rRNA sequence and established a 100% identity match with the 16 s rRNA sequence of the genus Faecalibacillus. We functionally annotated Ruminiclostridium, identifying 83 metabolic pathways, including pathways previously linked to blood pressure regulation. CONCLUSION In this large human observation, we show that gut microbiome diversity and composition are associated with hypertension. Our results suggest that targeting the microbiome may be a novel means to prevent or treat hypertension.","Louca, Panayiotis; Nogal, Ana; Wells, Philippa M; Asnicar, Francesco; Wolf, Jonathan; Steves, Claire J; Spector, Tim D; Segata, Nicola; Berry, Sarah E; Valdes, Ana M; Menni, Cristina",Journal of hypertension,687,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective database review of patients with pre-existing TIPS undergoing RF ablation of HCC was conducted over a 159-month period ending in November 2013. TIPS patency pre- and post-RF ablation was assessed by ultrasound, angiography, and/or contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. Patient demographics and immediate post-RF ablation outcomes and complications were also reviewed. RESULTS 19 patients with 21 lesions undergoing 25 RF ablation sessions were included. Child-Pugh class A, B, and C scores were seen in 1, 13, and 5 patients, respectively. Eleven patients (58 %) ultimately underwent liver transplantation. Immediate technical success was seen in all ablation sessions without residual tumor enhancement (100 %). No patients (0 %) suffered liver failure within 1 month of ablation. Pre-ablation TIPS patency was demonstrated in 22/25 sessions (88 %). Of 22 cases with patent TIPS prior to ablation, post-ablation patency was demonstrated in 22/22 (100 %) at immediate post-ablation imaging and in 21/22 (95 %) at last follow-up (1 patient was incidentally noted to have occlusion 31 months later). No immediate complications were observed. CONCLUSION Ablation efficacy was similar to the cited literature values for patients without TIPS. Furthermore, TIPS patency was preserved in the majority of cases. Patients with both portal hypertension and HCC are not uncommonly encountered, and a pre-existing TIPS does not appear to be a definite contraindication for RF ablation.","Park, Jonathan K; Al-Tariq, Quazi Z; Zaw, Taryar M; Raman, Steven S; Lu, David S K",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,687,31

In the positive group, 92% (48/52) had nucleic acid-negative conversion with a mean nucleic acid-negative conversion time of 22.58 ± 10.30 days. Among them, 41 (78.85%) cases were delayed compared with pharynx/nasal swab nucleic acid-negative conversion time. CONCLUSIONS The positive rate of fecal/perianal swab nucleic acid in male patients was higher than that in female patients. Fecal/perianal swab nucleic acid positive may be an indicator of critical conditions in those with COVID-19.","Chen, Gong-Qi; Luo, Wen-Tao; Zhao, Chao-Hui; Li, Chun-Na; Hong, Zhong-Si; Xia, Jin-Yu; Liu, Xi",Journal of infection in developing countries,687,1

The objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of meloxicam oral suspension in reducing pain and inflammation in calves following band or surgical castration. METHODS Two identical trials with the exception of the method of castration (Band Castration Study 1 and Surgical Castration Study 2) were conducted. Sixty (60) healthy Holstein calves 4 to 5 months of age (138-202 Kg) were used. Animals received either Meloxicam Oral Suspension at a dose of 1 mg/kg BW (n = 15 Study 1 and 15 Study 2) or Saline (n = 15 Study 1 and 15 Study 2) 2 h before castration. Physiological (Heart Rate, Plasma Cortisol and Plasma Substance P) and Behavioral (Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Accelerometers and tail Pedometers) evaluations were conducted before (day -1) and after Castration (Day 0, 1, 2, 3). Inflammation was evaluated daily by providing an individual animal score (Study1) or with a measurement of scrotal thickness (Study 2). RESULTS Heart rates were significantly greater in control animals following band and surgical castration. Plasma cortisol and substance P were significantly reduced in animals receiving Meloxicam Oral Suspension. Control animals had significantly greater VAS scores. Accelerometers showed that meloxicam treated animals had a significantly greater motion index and number of steps as well as less % time lying and number of lying bouts. The scrotal inflammation (based on scrotal swelling) was significantly decreased in the meloxicam treated animals compared to the control animals on day 1, day 2 and 3. CONCLUSION Meloxicam Oral Suspension was able to significantly reduce the display of painful behaviors and physiological responses to pain in band castrated and surgical castrated calves for up to 72 h following a single oral treatment of 1 mg/kg body weight. Meloxicam Oral Suspension was able to significantly reduce scrotal inflammation in band castrated and surgical castrated calves.","Olson, M E; Ralston, Brenda; Burwash, Les; Matheson-Bird, Heather; Allan, Nick D",BMC veterinary research,687,1

Sometimes, this role includes the task of reassuring parents who are vaccine hesitant that vaccines are safe and effective. Now, because of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), providers are presented with the additional challenge of maintaining and strengthening routine vaccination during a pandemic. As COVID-19 cases increased and states implemented stay-at-home orders, outpatient visits declined significantly. As a result, childhood immunization rates also declined. Increasing communication efforts regarding the importance of vaccination will be worthwhile, as the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the threat of an infectious disease and has increased awareness of the vaccine development process. Prior to 2020, many parents had not seen the devastating consequences of an infectious disease. The pandemic may change a parent's perspective, particularly as it relates to the influenza vaccine.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Between January 2008 and December 2010, 65 patients underwent conventional or LESS ureterolithotomy. CL-RU was performed in 42 patients. These patients were compared with the remaining 23 patients who underwent LESS-RU. Indications for the operations were obstructive or impacted ureteral stones larger than 15 mm in the middle or upper part of the ureter. The following parameters of CL-RU were compared with the LESS-RU: operative time, blood loss, transfusion rates, duration of analgesia, postoperative pain, hospitalization time, and time to return to normal activities. RESULTS No difference was observed between the below-mentioned, respective parameters of CL-RU and LESS-RU groups: mean operative time (74.1 vs 69.9 min, P = .54), blood loss (54.9 vs 56.1 mL, P = .49), transfusion rates (0% for both), and hospitalization time (3.1 vs 2.9 days, P = .61). Duration of analgesia in patients who underwent CL-RU was longer than those who underwent LESS-RU (5.2 vs 2.4 days, P = .001). Time to return to normal activities in CL-RU patients was also longer than LESS-RU patients (9.7 vs 6.4 days, P = .001). Compared to CL-RU, mean visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were lower during postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 in LESS-RU patients. Urine leakage was observed in 2 cases in each group. CONCLUSION LESS ureterolithotomy performed by adopting the retroperitoneal approach seems to be a safe, reliable, and minimally invasive procedure after failed shock wave lithotripsy or ureteroscopy (URS). Naturally, further prospective, randomized, and controlled studies on large samples are needed to test the effectiveness of this approach.","Tugcu, Volkan; Simsek, Abdulmuttalip; Kargi, Taner; Polat, Hakan; Aras, Bekir; Tasci, Ali Ihsan",Urology,687,1

Tα1 (ZADAXIN®) is used worldwide for treating viral infections, immunodeficiencies, and malignancies. Owing to its ability to activate the tolerogenic pathway of tryptophan catabolism - via the immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase - Tα1 potentiates immune tolerance mechanisms, breaking the vicious circle that perpetuates chronic inflammation in response to a variety of infectious noxae. AREAS COVERED Tα1 has never been studied in Cystic fibrosis (CF) in which the hyperinflammatory state is associated with early and nonresolving activation of innate immunity, which impairs microbial clearance and promotes a self-sustaining condition of progressive lung damage. Optimal CF treatments should, indeed, not only rescue CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein localization and functionality but also alleviate the associated hyperinflammatory pathology. Because of the inherent complexity of the pathogenetic mechanisms, a multidrug approach is required. EXPERT OPINION By providing a multipronged attack against CF, i.e. restraining inflammation and correcting the basic defect, Tα1 favorably opposed CF symptomatology in preclinical relevant disease settings, thus suggesting its possible exploitation for 'real-life' clinical efficacy in CF. This could represent a major conceptual advance in the CF field, namely the proposal of a drug with the unique activity to correct CFTR defects through regulation of inflammation.","Stincardini, Claudia; Renga, Giorgia; Villella, Valeria; Pariano, Marilena; Oikonomou, Vasilis; Borghi, Monica; Bellet, Marina M; Sforna, Luigi; Costantini, Claudio; Goldstein, Allan L; Garaci, Enrico; Romani, Luigina",Expert opinion on biological therapy,687,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS Seven patients (5 men; mean age 83; range 79-90) underwent transcatheter embolisation between July 2013 and August 2014. The average time from EVAS to embolisation was 136 days (range 6-301) and from endoleak diagnosis to embolisation was 20 days (range 2-50). Embolisation was performed with coils and Onyx in six cases and Onyx only in one case. Technical success, imaging and clinical outcomes of embolisation were reviewed. Technical success was defined as elimination of the endoleak on completion angiography and first imaging follow-up. Clinical success was defined as unchanged or decreased aneurysm sac size on subsequent follow-up (average 8 months; range 103-471 days). RESULTS All cases were technically successful. One patient required a second endovascular procedure following Onyx reflux into the Nellix endograft and another patient required surgical closure of a brachial puncture site. All patients are endoleak free with stable sac size on the latest available follow-up imaging.

We abstracted primary and secondary outcomes, statistical analysis methods, and patient samples evaluated (all randomized patients vs. ""survivors only""). RESULTS Of 1947 RCTs identified, 434 met eligibility criteria. Of the eligible RCTs, 91 (21%) and 351 (81%) had a primary or secondary functional outcome, respectively, of which 36 (40%) and 263 (75%) evaluated treatment effects among ""survivors only"". In RCTs that analyzed all randomized patients, the most common methods included use of ordinal outcomes (e.g., modified Rankin Scale) or creating composite outcomes (primary: 41 of 91 [45%]; secondary: 57 of 351 [16%]). CONCLUSION In RCTs enrolling patients at high risk of death, statistical analyses of functional outcomes are frequently conducted among ""survivors only,"" for which conclusions might be misleading.

PURPOSE To compare technical success and accuracy of hepatic thermoablation using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquired 24 h after ablation with regard to evaluation of the post-interventional ablation zone and local tumor recurrence (LTR), and to assess whether additional MRI within 24 h is beneficial. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-two patients (23 men, 9 women; mean age, 60 years) with 48 lesions were included in this retrospective study. CT was performed immediately and MRI was performed 24 h after ablation. Diameter and volume calculations of the ablation zone were compared (T-Test). Technical success and ablation margin distinction, shape, and configuration were evaluated (κ-statistic). Local effectiveness was calculated based on follow-up imaging. Technical success and ablation margin features were correlated with LTR (log-rank test, Fisher's exact test). RESULTS Ablation zone volumes were significantly higher with MRI compared to CT (P < 0.05; mean volume, 55.19 and 45.97 mL). Agreement between CT and MRI for technical success was good (κ = 0.801) and for margin conspicuity fair (κ = 0.289). LTR was 26.1% (mean follow-up, 11.7 months). LTR showed no correlation with technical success or margin conspicuity. CONCLUSION CT and MRI are suited for early evaluation of technical success after thermoablation. Within 24 h a significant increase of the ablation volume is observed, which has to be taken into account when interpreting immediate postprocedural imaging and treating lesions near critical structures. Additional MRI 24 h after ablation seems of limited value regarding prognosis of LTR, especially with regards to evaluation of ablation margin shape and conspicuity.","Ringe, Kristina Imeen; Wacker, Frank; Raatschen, Hans-Jürgen",Acta radiologica,687,1

From June 2009 to May 2014, 154 patients who underwent a VATS lobectomy were included in our study. Patients' characteristics, pathology background, operative times, overall length of stay, overall morbidity and type of major complications were recorded for all patients and compared between non converted (n = 133) and converted (n = 21) patients. To evaluate surgeon's learning curve, we analyzed rates and causes of conversion in the first period (first 77 patients) and in the last period (78-154 patients). Patients characteristics were similar between converted and non-converted groups. Patients who were converted to open thoracotomy presented more frecuently tumors >3 cms (P = 0.02).

The positive immunostaining overlapped with VEGFR-3 confirmed high affinity and selectivity of one novel peptide (CP-7). In addition, cell uptake of FITC-CP-7 peptide was significantly blocked by coinjection of excess CP-7 peptide. After labeled with 131I, the profile of pharmacology and biodistribution could be traced in vivo. The 131I-radiolabeled CP-7 peptide conjugates were >85% stable in serum over 4 h and exhibited a specific uptake of 18.04 ± 2.04% ID/g at 0.5 h after injection to high VEGFR-3 expressing A549 tumor mice. More importantly, lower uptake concentration in heart (1.06 ± 0.15% ID/g) after 2 h demonstrated the safety of peptide in vivo. The high uptake in the kidneys revealed that renal clearance was the main route of 131I-CP-7 peptide elimination from the body. Lower accumulation of 131I-CP-7 peptide in VEGFR-3 negative HeLa tumor mice further indicated that CP-7 peptide exhibited a higher tumor-homing efficiency. These studies provided a straightforward analytical access to design and screen bioactive peptide based on protein structure and revealed that CP-7 peptide represented a promising homing peptide of VEGFR-3-positive cancer in vitro and in vivo which could be used as a novel target molecule to achieve efficient drug delivery.","Li, Hong M; Dong, Zhi P; Wang, Qi Y; Liu, Li X; Li, Bing X; Ma, Xiao N; Lin, Ming S; Lu, Tao; Wang, Yue",Molecular pharmaceutics,687,1

Two months before, the patient underwent an uneventful right lower lobectomy for squamous-cell lung cancer. A computed tomography scan revealed a para-mediastinal localized pneumothorax (measuring 6 cm in the major axis) starting from a right lower bronchus interruption associated with a middle lobe consolidation. The patient was consequently admitted for respiratory monitoring and underwent a fibre-optic bronchoscopy to assess bronchial integrity: the right lower bronchus was completely dehiscent and connected to an empty pleural closed pouch, with no inflammatory signs or sputum-like effusion. After the procedure, the clinical course was unremarkable with gradual improvement of clinical conditions: in particular, the cough disappeared and no sign of fever, leucocytosis or respiratory failure was observed. Thus, after a multidisciplinary meeting, the patient was discharged 7 days after admission and re-evaluated monthly. Six months after diagnosis, the patient was symptom-free with complete closure of the fistula on radiological imaging.","Leuzzi, Giovanni; Alessandrini, Gabriele; Forcella, Daniele; Facciolo, Francesco",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,687,4

The objective of this study was to report the clinical profile, short-term and long-term outcomes of dengue among renal transplant recipients. METHODS A total of 59 post-transplant dengue suspected cases were admitted from July 2019 to April 2020 of which 31 had confirmed dengue infection. The clinical and laboratory profile of the confirmed dengue cases (n = 31) were compared with non-dengue cases (n = 28). RESULTS Among the clinical and laboratory features retro-orbital pain, conjunctival redness, thrombocytopenia on admission and absence of arthralgia were significantly associated with dengue compared to non-dengue cases. No mortality was observed in the dengue cases. Allograft dysfunction, acute rejection and graft losses were identified in 64.5% (n=20), 6.4% (n = 2) and 6.4% (n= 2) dengue cases respectively. No rejection or graft losses were observed in 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS We report a differential clinical profile for dengue in transplant settings which will aid in the diagnosis. We also report successful management of dengue infection in renal transplant recipients with the majority having allograft dysfunction.

A patient with DMC can express a preference, understand information relevant to that choice, appreciate the significance of that information for their clinical condition, and reason about their choice in light of their goals and values. In contrast, a patient can possess the CDS even if they cannot appreciate their condition or reason about the relative risks and benefits of their options. Patients who lack DMC for many or most kinds of medical choices may nonetheless possess the CDS, particularly since the complex means-ends reasoning required by DMC is one of the first capacities to be lost in progressive cognitive diseases (eg, Alzheimer's disease). That is, patients with significant cognitive decline or mental illness may still understand what a surrogate does, express a preference about a potential surrogate, and be able to provide some kind of justification for that selection. Moreover, there are many legitimate and relevant rationales for surrogate selection that are inconsistent with the reasoning criterion of DMC. Unfortunately, many patients are prevented from designating a surrogate if they are judged to lack DMC. When such patients possess the CDS, this practice is ethically wrong, legally dubious and imposes avoidable burdens on healthcare institutions.","Navin, Mark; Wasserman, Jason Adam; Stahl, Devan; Tomlinson, Tom",Journal of medical ethics,687,1

It is defined as the presence of fatty liver along with inflammation and hepatocyte injury. To date, weight loss achieved via lifestyle intervention remains the mainstay of NASH treatment. However, given the known benefit of weight loss on NASH and the known effect of bariatric surgery on weight loss, several studies have explored the potential role of bariatric surgery on the treatment of NASH. RECENT FINDINGS This review article summarizes the evidence on the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), a common bariatric surgery, on NASH therapy. Specifically, studies show that RYGB is associated with an improvement of all NASH histologic features at 1 year. Compared to adjustable gastric band, RYGB appears to be superior at treating NASH. Randomized controlled trials and long-term studies are underway to better clarify the role of these procedures specifically for NASH therapy.","Jirapinyo, Pichamol; Thompson, Christopher C",Current gastroenterology reports,687,13

OBJECTIVE To determine whether facility-level fluoroquinolone use predicts healthcare facility-associated (HCFA) CDI due to fluoroquinolone-resistant 027 strains. METHODS Using a nationwide cohort of hospitalized patients in the Veterans' Affairs Healthcare System, we identified hospitals that categorized >80% of CDI cases as positive or negative for the 027 strain for at least one-quarter of fiscal years 2011-2018. Within these facilities, we used visual summaries and multilevel logistic regression models to assess the association between facility-level fluoroquinolone use and rates of HCFA-CDI due to 027 strains, controlling for time and facility complexity level, and adjusting for correlated outcomes within facilities. RESULTS Between 2011 and 2018, 55 hospitals met criteria for reporting 027 results, including a total of 5,091 HCFA-CDI cases, with 1,017 infections (20.0%) due to 027 strains. Across these facilities, the use of fluoroquinolones decreased by 52% from 2011 to 2018, with concurrent reductions in the overall HCFA-CDI rate and the proportion of HCFA-CDI cases due to the 027 strain of 13% and 55%, respectively. A multilevel logistic model demonstrated a significant effect of facility-level fluoroquinolone use on the proportion of infections in the facility due to the 027 strain, most noticeably in low-complexity facilities. CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide support for interventions to reduce use of fluroquinolones as a control measure for CDI, particularly in settings where fluoroquinolone use is high and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains are common causes of infection.","Silva, Sandra Y; Wilson, Brigid M; Redmond, Sarah N; Donskey, Curtis J",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,687,1

These diets are restrictive and are associated with lower patient satisfaction and possibly malnutrition. Further, it is unclear if these restrictive diets are effective in reducing infection. We performed a meta-analysis on the rates of infection reported in trials comparing the neutropenic diet to unrestricted diets in cancer patients with neutropenia. METHODS AND MATERIALS A comprehensive database search for all published randomized controlled trials comparing infection rates in cancer patients receiving a neutropenic diet versus an unrestricted diet was performed for all publications in English language from database's inception until September 12, 2017. The search strategy, study selection, and subsequent analysis adhered to PRISMA guidelines. Random effects modeling was used to obtain pooled relative risks. The primary outcome measure was the rate of infection. RESULTS Five randomized controlled trials with a total of 388 patients were included in the final analysis. Patients mostly had acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or sarcoma. Infection was noted in 53.7% patients in the neutropenic diet group, as compared with 50% in the unrestricted diet group. No significant difference in infection rate was observed between the neutropenic diet versus unrestricted diet groups, pooled risk ratio (RR) 1.13 (95% CI, 0.98-1.30; P=0.10). CONCLUSIONS This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggests that the use of neutropenic diet was not associated with decreased risk of infection in neutropenic cancer patients. The continued use of neutropenic diets should be questioned.","Ball, Somedeb; Brown, Timothy J; Das, Avash; Khera, Rohan; Khanna, Sahil; Gupta, Arjun",American journal of clinical oncology,687,5

The authors report on acute extracranial haemorrhage in emergency situations but also on preventive embolization of good vascularized tumors preoperatively and their outcome. METHODS Retrospective analysis of 52 patients, who underwent an interdisciplinary approach of the ORL Department and the Interventional Neuroradiology over 5 ½ years at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Germany. Their outcome was analysed in terms of success of the embolization, blood loss, survival rate and treatment failures. RESULTS 39/52 patients were treated for acute haemorrhage. Twenty-five of them attributable to vascular erosion in case of malignant tumors. Affected vessels were the common carotid artery as well as its internal and external parts with branches like the ascending pharyngeal, the facial and the superior thyroid artery. Altogether 27/52 patients were treated for malignant tumors, 25/52 were attributable to acute haemorrhage due to epistaxis, after tonsillectomy, benign tumors and bleeding attributable to inflammations. Treatment of all patients consisted either of an unsuccessful approach via exposure, package of the bleeding, electrocoagulation or surgical ligature followed by embolization or the primary treatment via interventional embolization/stenting. CONCLUSIONS The common monitoring of patients at the ORL and interventional neuroradiology is an important alternative especially in the treatment of severe acute haemorrhage, following vascular erosion in malignant tumors or benign diseases. But also the preoperative embolization of good vascularized tumors must be taken into account to prevent severe blood loss or acute intraoperative bleeding.","Storck, Katharina; Kreiser, Kornelia; Hauber, Johannes; Buchberger, Anna-Maria; Staudenmaier, Rainer; Kreutzer, Kilian; Bas, Murat",Head & face medicine,687,7

Prior studies in Latin America had reported adherence of 16.4% on Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and 45.9% in Systemic Lupus Erythematous (SLE). There is evidence that these patients believe their treatment increases the risk and gravity of COVID-19 and therefore, suspending the treatment could reduce this risk. It has been shown that a Good adherence is associated to a better survival. Objectives: Describe the adherence to DMARDs in patients with Rheumatic diseases during COVID-19. Methods: Descriptive, cross-sectional, self-report study conducted in rheumatology outpatient clinic of University Hospital in Monterrey, México. Consecutive patients with RA, SLE, Inflammatory Myopathies and Systemic Sclerosis, were approached during their routine appointments, March 2020 to December 2020 period during COVID-19 pandemic. They were asked how many days of the month they took the DMARD indicated in the previous appointment, with Based on this, adherence was classified into four categories: Good 100-75% (> 21 days), Regular 74-50% (21-15 days), Bad 49-25% (14-8 days) and Null <25% (<7 days). Data was obtained from our internal electronic patient record registry and analyzed with SPSS V.22. RESULTS: Conclusion: Despite what it is believed, patients are not changing therapeutic regimes. The adherence found in this group of patients was good, for the definition used in this study. It should be considered that the self-report method may overestimate adherence, so the data found must be correlated with objective methods in the future.","Moreno-Arquieta, I.

Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal death, and survivors face lifelong risks of adverse outcomes. New approaches with large sample sizes are needed to identify strategies to predict and prevent preterm birth. The primary aims of the Washington University Prematurity Research Cohort Study were to conduct three prospective projects addressing possible causes of preterm birth and provide data and samples for future research. Study Design Pregnant patients were recruited into the cohort between January 2017 and January 2020. Consenting patients were enrolled into the study before 20 weeks' gestation and followed through delivery. Participants completed demographic and lifestyle surveys; provided maternal blood, placenta samples, and cord blood; and participated in up to three projects focused on underlying physiology of preterm birth: cervical imaging (Project 1), circadian rhythms (Project 2), and uterine magnetic resonance imaging and electromyometrial imaging (Project 3). Results A total of 1260 participants were enrolled and delivered during the study period. Of the participants, 706 (56%) were Black/African American, 494 (39%) were nulliparous, and 185 (15%) had a previous preterm birth. Of the 1260 participants, 1220 (97%) delivered a live infant. Of the 1220 with a live birth, 163 (14.1%) had preterm birth, of which 74 (6.1%) were spontaneous preterm birth. Of the 1220 participants with a live birth, 841 participated in cervical imaging, 1047 contributed data and/or samples on circadian rhythms, and 39 underwent uterine magnetic resonance imaging. Of the 39, 25 underwent electromyometrial imaging. Conclusion We demonstrate feasibility of recruiting and retaining a diverse cohort in a complex prospective, longitudinal study throughout pregnancy.

We hypothesized that while asymptomatic carriage would not increase the risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and graft loss, severe infection would. METHODS All lung transplant cases between January 2000 and July 2013 performed at our center were reviewed for respiratory viral samples. Each isolation of virus was classified according to clinical level of severity: asymptomatic, symptomatic without pneumonia, and viral pneumonia. Multivariate Cox modeling was used to assess the impact of CARV isolation on progression to CLAD and graft loss. RESULTS Four thousand four hundred eight specimens were collected from 563 total patients, with 139 patients producing 324 virus-positive specimens in 245 episodes of CARV infection. Overall, the risk of CLAD was elevated by viral infection (hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; P < 0.01). This risk, however, was due to viral pneumonia alone (HR, 3.94; P < 0.01), without significant impact from symptomatic viral infection (HR, 0.97; P = 0.94) nor from asymptomatic viral infection (HR, 0.99; P = 0.98). The risk of graft loss was not increased by asymptomatic CARV infection (HR, 0.74; P = 0.37) nor symptomatic CARV infection (HR, 1.39; P = 0.41). Viral pneumonia did, however, significantly increase the risk of graft loss (HR, 2.78; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS With respect to CARV, only viral pneumonia increased the risk of both CLAD and graft loss after lung transplantation. In the absence of pneumonia, respiratory viruses had no impact on measured outcomes.","Allyn, Paul R; Duffy, Erin L; Humphries, Romney M; Injean, Patil; Weigt, S Samuel; Saggar, Rajan; Shino, Michael Y; Lynch, Joseph P; Ardehali, Abbas; Kubak, Bernard; Tseng, Chi-Hong; Belperio, John A; Ross, David J; Gregson, Aric L",Transplantation,687,1

However, it is important to distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza. Here, we comparatively described the clinical characteristics of children with COVID-19 and paediatric patients with influenza. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we reviewed the electronic medical records of 585 paediatric patients with COVID-19 or influenza in Wuhan Children's Hospital, China. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes were comparatively analysed. RESULTS: The median ages were 6.96 years (IQR, 2-10.81) for children with confirmed COVID-19, 2.67 years (IQR, 1.03-15.25) for those with influenza A and 3.67 years (IQR, 1.62-5.54) for those with influenza B. Fever was a symptom in 84 (34.7%) COVID-19 cases, 132 (70.21%) influenza A cases and 111 (74.50%) influenza B cases. The median length of stay (LOS) was 11 (8-15) days for paediatric COVID-19 patients, 4 (3-6) days for influenza A patients and 5 (3-6) days for influenza B patients. Twenty-six (13.98%) influenza A patients and 18 (12.59%) influenza B patients presented with decreased white blood cell counts, while 13 (5.33%) COVID-19 patients presented with decreased white blood cell counts. Eight (3.28%) COVID-19 patients, 23 (12.71%) influenza A patients and 21 (14.79%) influenza B patients experienced lymphocytopenia. Acute cardiac injury occurred in 18 (7.29%) COVID-19 patients, while 37 (19.68%) influenza A and 27 (18.12%) influenza B patients had acute cardiac injury. CONCLUSION: In this study, the illnesses of children with COVID-19 were demonstrated to be less severe than those of paediatric patients with influenza, and COVID-19 patients had milder illness and fewer complications.","Liu, Xinghua; Li, Wei; Zhang, Bo; Guo, Yan; Hu, Zhao; Peng, Cao; Lei, Xiao; Luo, Qunying; Zhang, Qiong; Deng, Wei; Wang, Juanjuan; Tang, Jianqiao; Li, Yunqiao; Chen, Jianying",BMC Infect Dis,687,22

Despite this, video consultations (VCs) have not been frequently used in colorectal practice. We assessed outcomes, including the economic and environmental impact, of a VC clinic for new colorectal referrals. METHOD: This was a prospective observational study. Fifty consecutive patients attending a VC colorectal appointment were reviewed between March 2019 and February 2020. Face-to-face appointments during the same time period were also assessed. The distance, time, cost and carbon emissions of journeys were estimated using web-based resources. Estimated loss of earnings used data from the Office for National Statistics. The subsequent management plans were also recorded. RESULTS: Of 50 patients using VC, 40 used home devices and 10 used equipment in their local medical facility. Three patients had difficulties with the technology and converted to telephone review. Failure to attend VC appointments was less than for face-to-face appointments (4% vs 6.1%). VC appointments saved 6685 miles of travel (range 2-364 miles), 148 h travelling time and £1767 costs. Additional savings for loss of earnings were approximately £33.56 per patient. The carbon emissions saved was 4659 lb CO2 equivalent, corresponding to over 250 000 charges of a smartphone. CONCLUSION: The use of VC resulted in significant savings related to travel and reduced time and costs for patients who chose to use the service, in addition to the environmental benefits. In this current climate VC clinics have a central role in outpatient care for both new patients and follow-ups.","Sellars, H; Ramsay, G; Sunny, A; Gunner, C K; Oliphant, R; Watson, A J M",Colorectal dis,687,23

DESIGN: observational study with retrospective analysis. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2272 patients from the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) whose visits were rescheduled over lockdown (13 April to 1 June 2020) were offered participation in a self-monitoring initiative administered by SNEC with the Alleye application as the testing instrument. METHODS: This was an observational study with retrospective analysis. Demographics and characteristics were compared between those that signed up and those that did not. Similar comparisons were made between compliant patients versus those that were not. Outcomes were tracked for 6 months starting from the commencement of lockdown. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participation and compliance rates. Patient characteristics that were more likely to participate and remain compliant. RESULTS: A total 732 (32%) patients participated in this self-monitoring initiative. Those who participated were younger (62 vs. 68 years, p<0·001), men, and living with family. Patients not on treatment, and those with poorer vision in their worse-seeing eye were more likely to participate. When grouped according to diagnosis, the proportion who participated was highest for diabetic macular edema (52%), non-neovascular age related macular degeneration (nAMD)(42%), diabetic retinopathy(35%), retinal vein occlusions(18%) , and nAMD(15%) (p<0·001). Testing compliance rate was 43% (315/732). Compliant patients were older, on treatment, and had poorer vision in the worse-seeing eye. Trigger events occurred in 33 patients with 5 patients having clinically verified disease progression (1·6%). CONCLUSION: We provide real-world data on characteristics of patients with stable retinal diseases who were offered and participated in, and were compliant, with a self-monitoring program. The lower participation rate compared to standardized clinical studies reflects the difficulties in implementation for such initiatives in real-world settings. Despite this, self-monitoring continues to show promise in relieving clinic resources, suggesting the feasibility of scaling such programs beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chong Teo, Kelvin Yi; Bachmann, Lucas M; Sim, Dawn; Yen, Lee Shu; Tan, Anna; Wong, Tien Y; Gemmy Cheung, Chui Ming; Wei Tan, Gavin Siew",,687,1

As the mevalonate pathway (MVP) prevents the activation of inflammasomes and cytokine release and regulates endosomal transport, compromised signaling could be associated with the pathobiology of COVID-19. Prior transcriptomic studies of host cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection have not reported to date the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the MVP. In this study, we accessed public data sets to report in silico investigations into gene expression. In addition, we proposed candidate genes that are thought to have a direct association with the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and which may be dependent on signals derived from the MVP. Our results revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the MVP. These results were not found when investigating the gene expression data from host cells infected with H3N2 influenza virus, H1N1 influenza virus, or respiratory syncytial virus. Our manually curated gene set showed significant gene expression variability in A549 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, as per Blanco-Melo et al. data set (GSE147507). In light of the present findings, SARS-CoV-2 could hijack the MVP, leading to hyperinflammatory responses.

Considering the virus' zoonotic potential, its genome nature (segmented RNA virus), its worldwide circulation in livestock, and its role in bovine respiratory disease, an increased interest is given to IDV. However, few data are available on drivers of emergence of IDV. We first listed fifty possible drivers of emergence of IDV in ruminants and swine. As recently carried out for COVID19 in pets (Saegerman e,t al, 2020b), a scoring system was developed per driver and scientific experts (N = 28) were elicited to: (i) allocate a score to each driver, (ii) weight the drivers scores within each domain and (iii) weight the different domains among themselves. An overall weighted score was calculated per driver; and drivers were ranked in decreasing order. Drivers with comparable likelihoods to play a role in the emergence of IDV in ruminants and swine in Europe were grouped using a regression tree analysis. Finally, the robustness of the expert elicitation was verified. Eight drivers were ranked with the highest probability to play a key role in the emergence of IDV: current species specificity of the causing agent of the disease; influence of (il)legal movements of live animals (ruminants, swine) from neighbouring/European Union member states and from Third countries for the disease to (re-)emerge in a given country; detection of emergence; current knowledge of the pathogen; vaccine availability; animal density; and transport vehicles of live animals. As there is still limited scientific knowledge on the topic, expert elicitation of knowledge and multi-criteria decision analysis, in addition to clustering and sensitivity analyses, are very important to prioritize future studies, starting from the top eight drivers. The present methodology could be applied to other emerging animal diseases.","Saegerman, Claude; Bianchini, Juana; Snoeck, Chantal J; Moreno, Ana; Chiapponi, Chiara; Zohari, Siamak; Ducatez, Mariette F",Transbound. emerg. dis.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of online group work in interprofessional education. A total of 209 students were assigned to 50 groups (18 medical student groups, 13 nursing student groups, and 19 mixed medical/nursing student groups). Learners performed group work during the orientation for the course, which was hosted using an online video conferencing system. The learners first performed the activity individually (10 min) and then engaged in a group discussion to reach consensus on their answers (30 min). We calculated the scores before and after the group discussion and shared the results with the students. Scores were improved after the group discussion (mean ± SEM, 23.7 ± 0.9) compared with before (37.3 ± 1.3) (P < .0001). Lower scores after the group discussion, which indicated the effect of the group discussion on making better decisions, were observed most in the mixed medical/nursing student groups, followed by the nursing student and medical student groups. We noted only 3 groups in which the group discussion showed a negative effect on decision-making: all 3 of these groups were mixed (3 of 19 groups; 16%). These data demonstrated the power of group discussion for solving tasks when the participants' professional fields were mixed. However, the small size of the interdisciplinary groups might have resulted in less effective discussion, which might be due in part to psychological barriers arising from professional differences. Online group work is effective for facilitating discussion and building consensus about decisions in interprofessional education for medical and nursing students. Potential psychological barriers may exist in about 16% of mixed group students at the start, which should be kept in mind by instructors.

In this paper, we review current literature on the effect of weather (temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, etc.) and climate (temperature as an essential climate variable, solar radiation in the ultraviolet, sunshine duration) variables on SARS-CoV-2 and discuss their impact to the COVID-19 pandemic; the review also refers to respective effect of urban parameters and air pollution. Most studies suggest that a negative correlation exists between ambient temperature and humidity on the one hand and the number of COVID-19 cases on the other, while there have been studies which support the absence of any correlation or even a positive one. The urban environment and specifically the air ventilation rate, as well as air pollution, can probably affect, also, the transmission dynamics and the case fatality rate of COVID-19. Due to the inherent limitations in previously published studies, it remains unclear if the magnitude of the effect of temperature or humidity on COVID-19 is confounded by the public health measures implemented widely during the first pandemic wave. The effect of weather and climate variables, as suggested previously for other viruses, cannot be excluded, however, under the conditions of the first pandemic wave, it might be difficult to be uncovered. The increase in the number of cases observed during summertime in the Northern hemisphere, and especially in countries with high average ambient temperatures, demonstrates that weather and climate variables, in the absence of public health interventions, cannot mitigate the resurgence of COVID-19 outbreaks.","Paraskevis, Dimitrios; Kostaki, Evangelia Georgia; Alygizakis, Nikiforos; Thomaidis, Nikolaos S; Cartalis, Constantinos; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Dimopoulos, Meletios Athanasios",Sci Total Environ,687,27

Little is known on the consequences of SARS-COV-2 on cognitive functions of patients in the sub-acute phase of the disease. We aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on cognitive functions of patients admitted to the COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit of the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 87 patients admitted to the COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit from March 27th to June 20th 2020 were included. Patients underwent Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Data were divided in 4 groups according to the respiratory assistance in the acute phase: Group1 (orotracheal intubation), Group2 (non-invasive ventilation using Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure), Group3 (Venturi Masks), Group4 (no oxygen therapy). Follow-ups were performed at one month after home-discharge. RESULTS: Out of the 87 patients (62 Male, mean age 67.23 ± 12.89 years), 80% had neuropsychological deficits (MoCA and MMSE) and 40% showed mild-to-moderate depression. Group1 had higher scores than Group3 for visuospatial/executive functions (p = 0.016), naming (p = 0.024), short- and long-term memory (p = 0.010, p = 0.005), abstraction (p = 0.024), and orientation (p = 0.034). Group1 was younger than Groups2 and 3. Cognitive impairments correlated with patients' age. Only 18 patients presented with anosmia. Their data did not differ from the other patients. FIM (<100) did not differ between groups. Patients partly recovered at one-month follow-up and 43% showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe functional impairments had important cognitive and emotional deficits which might have been influenced by the choice of ventilatory therapy, but mostly appeared to be related to aging, independently of FIM scores. These findings should be integrated for correct neuropsychiatric assistance of COVID-19 patients in the subacute phase of the disease, and show the need for long-term psychological support and treatment of post-COVID-19 patients.","Alemanno, Federica; Houdayer, Elise; Parma, Anna; Spina, Alfio; Del Forno, Alessandra; Scatolini, Alessandra; Angelone, Sara; Brugliera, Luigia; Tettamanti, Andrea; Beretta, Luigi; Iannaccone, Sandro",PLoS One,687,26

Radiation dose-volume histograms were generated for the heart and coronary arteries for each patient. RESULTS: The median (IQR) of mean cardiac radiation doses was 12.0 (1.2, 24.2) Gray. There were significant inverse correlations between mean radiation dose and global MFR (MFRGlobal) and MFR in the left anterior descending artery territory (MFRLAD): Pearson's correlation coefficient = - .37 (P = .03) and - .38 (P = .03), respectively. For every one Gray increase in mean cardiac radiation dose, there was a mean ± standard error decrease of .02 ± .01 in MFRGlobal (P = .04) and MFRLAD (P = .03) after adjustment.

This pandemic has been preceded by several other interferences on a smaller scale, setting the scene for crises in perpetuity. With a reactive stance adopted, these crises may result in rapid shifts to curricula, minimizing the opportunity for thorough planning and critical analyses. GUIDANCE FROM THE LITERATURE: Recognizing the limited frameworks available to provide structure to such curricular crises responses, we drew on the literature to develop a crisis-curriculum analysis framework. The work of the SPICES model by Harden et al., the four-dimensional framework by Steketee et al., and Deverell's crisis-induced learning, was used to develop the framework. CRISIS-CURRICULUM ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK: The framework provides a structured approach to curriculum analysis in the face of disruption. It is designed to meet the needs of the global health professions education community, currently in the midst of a crisis. Accompanied by a step-wise guideline, this framework is suitable for educators requiring a practically-orientated approach to curriculum analysis. CONCLUSION: Recognizing that curriculum analysis is but one part of crisis-management, we argue that this crisis-curriculum analysis framework may align well with strengthening institutional readiness as educators seek to refine and entrench curricular practices adopted during COVID-19.","Govender, Lynelle; de Villiers, Marietjie R",Med Teach,687,29

A nationally representative online and telephone survey conducted in 12-26 October on the Social Research Centre's Life in AustraliaTM panel (aged &#8805; 18 y, 78.8% response, N = 3043) asked about access, visitation, and felt benefits from green and/or blue spaces. Increasing financial difficulty was associated with less time in and fewer visits to green and/or blue spaces, as well as fewer different types visited. Financial difficulty was also associated with feelings that visits to green and/or blue space had less benefit for maintaining social connection. Working from home was associated with more frequent and longer visitation to green and/or blue spaces, as well as discovery of ones previously unvisited. Working from home was also associated with increased levels of exercise and respite resulting from visits to green and/or blue spaces. Residents of Melbourne, a city of 4.9 million who were in 'lockdown' at the time of the survey, appeared more likely to benefit from visits to green and/or blue spaces than residents of Sydney, Australia's largest city at 5.2 million, who were not in lockdown. Residents of Melbourne compared with Sydney reported consistently increased visitation of, discovery of, and greater levels of various felt benefits derived from green and/or blue spaces, including more respite, connection, and exercise. Comparatively shorter distances to preferred green and/or blue spaces and closure of alternative settings at the time of the survey completion in Melbourne compared with Sydney may provide partial explanation, though more acute responses to experiencing green and/or blue spaces within highly cognitively demanding antecedent conditions posed by lockdown are also plausible and warrant further investigation with other health indicators. These results were robust to adjustment for a range of covariates including preferences for natural settings, which were consistently associated with greater levels of green and/or blue space visitation and felt benefits. Collectively, these results indicate that parallel efforts to generate (or renew) felt connection to natural settings, to increase working from home opportunities, and to mitigate financial difficulties may be important to help maximize the population health benefits of urban planning strategies intended to improve the availability of, and to reduce inequities in access to, green and blue spaces. Benefits felt more commonly by people living through lockdown underlines the role previous investments in green and blue space have played in enabling coping during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Astell-Burt, Thomas; Feng, Xiaoqi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),687,24

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) seem to be more prone to a severe course of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to comorbidities and an altered immune system. The study's aim was to identify factors predicting mortality among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with CKD. METHODS: We analyzed 2817 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients enrolled in the Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and identified 426 patients with pre-existing CKD. Group comparisons were performed via Chi-squared test. Using univariate and multivariable logistic regression, predictive factors for mortality were identified. RESULTS: Comparative analyses to patients without CKD revealed a higher mortality (140/426, 32.9% versus 354/2391, 14.8%). Higher age could be confirmed as a demographic predictor for mortality in CKD patients (> 85 years compared to 15-65 years, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 6.49, 95% CI 1.27-33.20, p = 0.025). We further identified markedly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (> 2 × upper limit of normal, aOR 23.21, 95% CI 3.66-147.11, p < 0.001), thrombocytopenia (< 120,000/µl, aOR 11.66, 95% CI 2.49-54.70, p = 0.002), anemia (Hb < 10 g/dl, aOR 3.21, 95% CI 1.17-8.82, p = 0.024), and C-reactive protein (&#8805; 30 mg/l, aOR 3.44, 95% CI 1.13-10.45, p = 0.029) as predictors, while renal replacement therapy was not related to mortality (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 0.68-1.93, p = 0.611).

If rules of medical ethics apply to practitioners, they are also military: in this context, the notions of ethics of responsibility and ethics of conviction bring questions. Its questions are even more complex when these soldiers are projected into external operations where current conflicts, of a terrorist nature, expose the local populations, women and children specifically. Nevertheless, the SSA can also be projected to respond to exclusively health issues (excluding conflicts) as during the Ebola epidemic in Guinea in 2014, or more recently in Mulhouse with COVID-19.

CHIKV has been emerging globally, while neither a vaccine nor antiviral medication is available. The anti-parasitic drug suramin was previously shown to inhibit CHIKV replication. In this study we aimed to obtain more detailed insight into its mechanism of action. We found that suramin interacts with virions and can inhibit virus binding to cells. It also appeared to inhibit post-attachment steps of the infection process, likely by preventing conformational changes of the envelope glycoproteins required for fusion and the progression of infection. Suramin-resistant CHIKV strains were selected and genotyping and reverse genetics experiments indicated that mutations in E2 were responsible for resistance. The substitutions N5R and H18Q were reverse engineered in the E2 glycoprotein in order to understand their role in resistance. The binding of suramin-resistant viruses with these two E2 mutations was inhibited by suramin like that of wild-type virus, but they appeared to be able to overcome the post-attachment inhibitory effect of suramin. Conversely, a virus with a G82R mutation in E2 (implicated in attenuation of vaccine strain 181/25), which renders it dependent on the interaction with heparan sulfate for entry, was more sensitive to suramin than wild-type virus. Using molecular modelling studies, we predicted the potential suramin binding sites on the mature spikes of the chikungunya virion. We conclude that suramin interferes with CHIKV entry by interacting with the E2 envelope protein, which inhibits attachment and also interferes with conformational changes required for fusion.","Albulescu, Irina C; White-Scholten, Leonie; Tas, Ali; Hoornweg, Tabitha E; Ferla, Salvatore; Kovacikova, Kristina; Smit, Jolanda M; Brancale, Andrea; Snijder, Eric J; van Hemert, Martijn J",Viruses,687,1

Shorter than normal clotting time (CT) and higher than normal maximum clot firmness (MCF) in extrinsic rotational thromboelastometry (EXTEM) and fibrinogen rotational thromboelastometry (FIBTEM), shorter than normal EXTEM clot formation time (CFT), and higher than normal &#945;-angle were classified as markers of hypercoagulable state. Increment in the number of patients with &#8805;2 hypercoagulable parameters, higher EXTEM (P = .0001), FIBTEM MCF (P = .0001) and maximum lysis decrement (P = .002) with increment in disease severity was observed (P = .0001). Significant positive correlations between IL6 and CT EXTEM (P = .003), MCF EXTEM (P = .033), MCF FIBTEM (P = .01), and negative with ML EXTEM (P = .006) were seen. Our findings based on analysis of different disease severity groups confirmed that a hypercoagulable ROTEM pattern characterized by clot formation acceleration, high clot strength, and reduced fibrinolysis was more frequent in advanced disease groups and patients with high IL6.

However, in densely populated countries it is very hard for law enforcing organizations to monitor the number of people wearing mask and those who are not wearing any in public. For this reason, a facemask detection model can be developed for security cameras in public places and surveil on people. In this research, researchers developed a prototype of facemask detector using python codes and artificial intelligence. Since Machine cannot understand human language, developers use different types of programming languages for training machine. Here, Python was used with the help of its packages to train models and two separate python files were developed to complete this research;the first one is to develop a mask detector and the other one to combine mask and face detector, combined together to develop facemask detector in real time. Data was collected, analyzed and visualized with python programming language, model was trained using ConvNet (Convolutional Neural Network) and finally an output was received from a raw input, which can detect mask in human face. © 2021","Kabir, A.

The D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is known to markedly enhance viral infectivity but is difficult to detect. Here, we report an effective approach called ""synthetic mismatch integrated crRNA guided Cas12a detection"" (symRNA-Cas12a) to detect the D614 and G614 variants effectively. Using this method, we systemically screened a pool of crRNAs that contain all the possible nucleotide substitutions covering the -2 to +2 positions around the mutation and identify one crRNA that can efficiently increase the detection specificity by 13-fold over the ancestral crRNA. With this selected crRNA, the symRNA-Cas12a assay can detect as low as 10 copies of synthetic mutant RNA and the results are confirmed to be accurate by Sanger sequencing. Overall, we have developed the symRNA-Cas12a method to specifically, sensitively and rapidly detect the SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutation.","Meng, Qingzhou; Wang, Xinjie; Wang, Yanqun; Dang, Lu; Liu, Xinyi; Ma, Xiaodong; Chi, Tian; Wang, Xian; Zhao, Qin; Yang, Guang; Liu, Ming; Huang, Xingxu; Ma, Peixiang",Biotechnol J,687,16

However, worldwide adoption of this practice has been slow and reasons for this are unclear. This study documents barriers and strategies for implementing and sustaining open visitation in adult intensive care units in the United States experienced by nursing leadership. RESEARCH DESIGN: Qualitative approach using grounded theory. PARTICIPANTS: Nurse leaders in adult intensive care units with open visitation. SETTING: Magnet® or Pathway to Excellence® designated hospitals in the United States. METHODS: Semi structured interviews were conducted with 19 nurse leaders from 15 geographically dispersed hospitals. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and imported into Atlas.ti qualitative software for analysis. Grounded theory constant comparison analysis was used for coding and category development. FINDINGS: The analysis revealed three barriers; nursing attitudes and clinical and nonclinical barriers. Strategies to overcome these barriers were empathy, evidence-based practice, models of care, shared governance, nurse discretion, security and family spaces. CONCLUSION: Intensive care nursing leadership experienced distinct barriers and strategies during pre-implementation, implementation and sustainment of open visitation. Other nursing leaders interested in open visitation can use these findings as they plan this transition in their intensive care units.","Milner, Kerry A; Marmo, Suzanne; Goncalves, Susan",Intensive Crit Care Nurs,687,5

To date, single cell and high-throughput systems based analyses of the peripheral and pulmonary immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 suggest that a hyperactive and dysregulated immune response underpins the development of severe disease, with a prominent role assigned to neutrophils. Characterised in part by robust generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), the presence of immature, immunosuppressive and activated neutrophil subsets in the circulation, and neutrophilic infiltrates in the lung, a granulocytic signature is emerging as a defining feature of severe COVID-19. Furthermore, an assessment of the number, maturity status and/or function of circulating neutrophils at the time of hospital admission has shown promise as a prognostic tool for the early identification of patients at risk of clinical deterioration. Here, by summarising the results of studies that have examined the peripheral and pulmonary immune response to SARS-CoV-2, we provide a comprehensive overview of the changes that occur in the composition, phenotype and function of the neutrophil pool in COVID-19 patients of differing disease severities and discuss potential mediators of SARS-CoV-2-induced neutrophil dysfunction. With few specific treatments currently approved for COVID-19, we conclude the review by discussing whether neutrophils represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19.","Hazeldine, Jon; Lord, Janet M",Front Immunol,687,17

The study explored differences in perceptions regarding students' VAI and penalties for VAI among 1482 students and 42 faculty members. Furthermore, we explored the impact of socio-demographic characteristics (ethnic majority vs. minority students), gender, and academic degree on the perceived severity of VAI. Presented with a battery of scenarios, participants assessed the severity of penalties imposed by a university disciplinary committee. Furthermore, participants selected the penalties they deemed appropriate for violations engaged in by students, including: reprimanding, financial, academic, and accessibility penalties. All participants tended to suggest more severe penalties for VAI conducted in traditional analog environments than for the same offenses in digital settings. Students perceived all four types of penalties imposed by the disciplinary committee to be significantly more severe than faculty members. Moreover, findings demonstrated a significant difference between faculty and students in both perceptions of the severity of VAI and in relation to suggested punishments. Consistent with the Self-Concept Maintenance Model (Mazar et al. in J Mark Res 45(6):633-644, 2008) and Neutralizing Effect (Brimble, in: Bretag (ed) Handbook of academic integrity, SpringerNature, Singapore, pp 365-382, 2016), ethnic minority students estimated cheating, plagiarism, and facilitation violations as more severe than majority students.

A re-loading dose is required if there's a 6-week or greater delay in treatment. In response to the potential treatment disruption due to COVID-19, the impact of dose delays and alternative dosing regimens on pertuzumab IV for HER2-positive breast cancer treatment is presented. Simulations were conducted by using the validated population pharmacokinetic model for pertuzumab, and included (1) 4, 6, and 9 week dose delays of the 840 mg/420 mg Q3W dosing regimen and (2) 840 mg/420 mg Q4W and 840 mg Q6W alternative dosing regimens. Simulations were compared to the currently approved pertuzumab dosing regimen. The simulations in 1000 virtual patients showed that a dose re-load (840 mg) is required following a dose delay of 6 weeks or greater to maintain comparable Ctrough levels to clinical trials. The 840 mg/420 mg Q4W and 840 mg Q6W alternative dosing regimens decrease median steady-state Ctrough by â¼40% compared to the approved regimen, and <90% of patients will be above the target Ctrough . Thus, the alternative 840 mg/420 mg Q4W and 840 mg Q6W pertuzumab dosing regimens are not recommended.

Recent estimates suggest that the dispersion parameter k for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is on the order of 0.1, which corresponds to about 10% of cases being the source of 80% of infections. To investigate how overdispersion might affect the outcome of various mitigation strategies, we developed an agent-based model with a social network that allows transmission through contact in three sectors: ""close"" (a small, unchanging group of mutual contacts as might be found in a household), ""regular"" (a larger, unchanging group as might be found in a workplace or school), and ""random"" (drawn from the entire model population and not repeated regularly). We assigned individual infectivity from a gamma distribution with dispersion parameter k We found that when k was low (i.e., greater heterogeneity, more superspreading events), reducing random sector contacts had a far greater impact on the epidemic trajectory than did reducing regular contacts; when k was high (i.e., less heterogeneity, no superspreading events), that difference disappeared. These results suggest that overdispersion of COVID-19 transmission gives the virus an Achilles' heel: Reducing contacts between people who do not regularly meet would substantially reduce the pandemic, while reducing repeated contacts in defined social groups would be less effective.","Sneppen, Kim; Nielsen, Bjarke Frost; Taylor, Robert J; Simonsen, Lone",Proc.

Most individuals are asymptomatic or display mild symptoms, which raises an inherent question as to how does the immune response differs from patients manifesting severe disease? During the initial phase of infection, dysregulated effector immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, megakaryocytes, basophils, eosinophils, erythroid progenitor cells, and Th17 cells can alter the trajectory of an infected patient to severe disease. On the other hand, properly functioning CD4+, CD8+ cells, NK cells, and DCs reduce the disease severity. Detailed understanding of the immune response of convalescent individuals transitioning from the effector phase to the immunogenic memory phase can provide vital clues to understanding essential variables to assess vaccine-induced protection. Although neutralizing antibodies can wane over time, long-lasting B and T memory cells can persist in recovered individuals. The natural immunological memory captures the diverse repertoire of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes after natural infection whereas, currently approved vaccines are based on a single epitope, spike protein. It is essential to understand the nature of the immune response to natural infection to better identify ‘correlates of protection’ against this disease. This article discusses recent findings regarding immune response against natural infection to SARS-CoV-2 and the nature of immunogenic memory. More precise knowledge of the acute phase of immune response and its transition to immunological memory will contribute to the future design of vaccines and the identification of variables essential to maintain immune protection across diverse populations.","Ahluwalia, Pankaj; Vaibhav, Kumar; Ahluwalia, Meenakshi; Mondal, Ashis K.; Sahajpal, Nikhil; Rojiani, Amyn M.; Kolhe, Ravindra",Front Immunol,687,20

Although numerous hypotheses have attempted to explain viral origins, none is backed by substantive data. We take full advantage of the wealth of available protein structural and functional data to explore the evolution of the proteomic makeup of thousands of cells and viruses. Despite the extremely reduced nature of viral proteomes, we established an ancient origin of the “viral supergroup” and the existence of widespread episodes of horizontal transfer of genetic information. Viruses harboring different replicon types and infecting distantly related hosts shared many metabolic and informational protein structural domains of ancient origin that were also widespread in cellular proteomes. Phylogenomic analysis uncovered a universal tree of life and revealed that modern viruses reduced from multiple ancient cells that harbored segmented RNA genomes and coexisted with the ancestors of modern cells. The model for the origin and evolution of viruses and cells is backed by strong genomic and structural evidence and can be reconciled with existing models of viral evolution if one considers viruses to have originated from ancient cells and not from modern counterparts.","Nasir, Arshan; Caetano-Anollés, Gustavo",Sci Adv,687,16

In this study, the codon usage bias and the base composition variations in the available 11 complete HBoV genome sequences have been investigated. Although, there is a significant variation in codon usage bias among different HBoV genes, codon usage bias in HBoV is a little slight, which is mainly determined by the base compositions on the third codon position and the effective number of codons (ENC) value. The results of correspondence analysis (COA) and Spearman's rank correlation analysis reveals that the G + C compositional constraint is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in HBoV and the gene's function also contributes to the codon usage in this virus. Moreover, it was found that the hydrophobicity of each protein and the gene length are also critical in affecting these viruses’ codon usage, although they were less important than that of the mutational bias and the genes’ function. At last, the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) of 44 genes from these 11 HBoV isolates is analyzed using a hierarchical cluster method. The result suggests that genes with same function yet from different isolates are classified into the same lineage and it does not depend on geographical location. These conclusions not only can offer an insight into the codon usage patterns and gene classification of HBoV, but also may help in increasing the efficiency of gene delivery/expression systems.","Zhao, Sheng; Zhang, Qin; Liu, Xiaolin; Wang, Xuemin; Zhang, Huilin; Wu, Yan; Jiang, Fei",Biosystems,687,10

The present study aimed to analyze the impact of the local COVID-19 pandemic on emergency resources of all hospitals in a major urban center (Mönchengladbach) in Germany. METHODS: This observational multicenter study involved all acute care hospitals (n = 4). Systemic emergency department (ED) parameters from weeks 4–24 in 2020 were compared to the corresponding period in 2019 for each hospital and in a summative data analysis using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: The first regional COVID-19 patients were detected in week 9 of 2020. The cumulative number of ED visits dropped from 34,659 in 2019 to 28,008 in 2020. Weekly ED visits per hospital decreased from week 8 onwards between 38% and 48% per week and hospital and began to rise again after week 16. The pooled data analysis of ED patients showed significant decreases in outpatient visits (20,152 vs. 16,477, p < 0.001), hospital admissions (14,507 vs. 11,531, p < 0.001), and work-related accidents (2290 vs. 1468, p < 0.001). The decrease in ED to ICU admissions showed no significance (2093 vs. 1566, p = 0.255). The decline in ED cases was equally distributed between the medical specialties. CONCLUSION: The regional COVID-19 outbreak led to significantly reduced ED contacts in a German major urban region after the first COVID-19 cases appeared. Both hospital admissions and the number of ED to ICU admissions decreased, whereas the ratio of emergency outpatients vs. inpatients remained stable. Therefore, it can be assumed that patients with severe medical problems did not seek emergency care. These secondary effects of the pandemic on healthcare and the socioeconomic impact should be analyzed further.","Bergrath, Sebastian; Strapatsas, Tobias; Tuemen, Michael; Reith, Thorsten; Deussen, Marc; Aretz, Olaf; Hohn, Andreas; Lahm, Andreas",Anaesthesist,687,20

However, the pandemic has caused collateral damage to those with non‐COVID‐19 diseases. We aimed to determine the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on the presentation of newly diagnosed childhood onset type 1 diabetes. METHODS: This was a cross‐sectional study conducted over a 1‐year period. We compared the severity of presentation of new‐onset type 1 diabetes in children under the age of 18 presenting to the multi‐centre North Central London diabetes network before (1 July 2019 to 22 March 2020) and during (23 March 2020 to 30 June 2020) the first wave of the COVID‐19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Over the 1‐year study period, a total of 30 children presented with new‐onset type 1 diabetes during the pre‐pandemic period and 17 presented during the first COVID‐19 wave. Children presented more frequently in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) during the first COVID‐19 wave compared with pre‐pandemic (pre‐pandemic: mild 13%, moderate 6.7%, severe 10%; first COVID‐19 wave: mild 5.9%, moderate 24%, severe 47%; p = 0.002). During the first COVID‐19 wave, DKA presentations in children with a family history of type 1 diabetes were fewer compared to those without a family history (33.3% vs. 100.0%; p = 0.006). Children presenting in severe DKA pre‐pandemic were younger than those not in severe DKA (3.9 years vs. 12.2 years, p < 0.001) but this difference was not significant during the first COVID‐19 wave (10.1 years vs. 11.2 years, p = 0.568). Presenting HbA(1c) measurement was higher in those presenting during the first COVID‐19 wave (13.0 ± 1.7 vs. 10.4 ± 3.2%; 119 ± 19 vs. 90 ± 35 mmol/mol; p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: The COVID‐19 pandemic is associated with increased severity of presentation of childhood onset type 1 diabetes. Whatever the context, young people with suspected new‐onset type 1 diabetes should be referred for urgent clinical review.","McGlacken‐Byrne, Sinéad M.; Drew, Samantha E.

Moribund Muskellunge exhibited tubular necrosis in the kidneys as well as multifocal coalescing necrotizing hepatitis. The FHMNV was also isolated from apparently healthy juvenile Muskellunge at the Wolf Lake State Fish Hatchery in Mattawan, Michigan. The identity of the two syncytia‐forming viruses (designated MUS‐WR and MUS‐WL from Wild Rose Hatchery and Wolf Lake State Fish Hatchery, respectively) as strains of FHMNV was determined based on multiple‐gene sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. The pathogenicity of the MUS‐WL FHMNV strain was determined by experimentally infecting naive juvenile Muskellunge through intraperitoneal injection with two viral concentrations (63 and 6.3 × 10(3) TCID(50)/fish). Both doses resulted in 100% mortality in experimentally infected fish, which exhibited severely pale gills and petechial hemorrhaging in eyes, fins, and skin. Histopathological alterations in experimentally infected fish were observed mainly in the hematopoietic tissues in the form of focal areas of necrosis. Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated partial spike glycoprotein and helicase gene sequences revealed differences between the MUS‐WL FHMNV, MUS‐WR FHMNV, and two other FHMNV originally isolated from moribund Fathead Minnows Pimephales promelas including the index FHMNV strain (GU002364). Based on a partial helicase gene sequence, a reverse transcriptase PCR assay was developed that is specific to FHMNV. These results give evidence that the risks posed to Muskellunge by FHMNV should be taken seriously.

The ability of the newly synthesized compound to inhibit viral replication was evaluated by a viral cytopathic effect (CPE)-based assay performed on MCR5 cells infected with one of the four human coronaviruses associated with respiratory distress, i.e., hCoV-229E, showing antiproliferative activity in the micromolar range (EC(50) = 12.9 ± 1.22 µM), with a very low cytotoxicity profile (CC(50) = 170 ± 3.79 µM, 307 ± 11.63 µM, and 174 ± 7.6 µM for A549, human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HELFs), and MRC5 cells, respectively). Docking and molecular dynamics simulations studies indicated that 8 efficaciously binds to the intended target hCoV-229E main protease (M(pro)). Moreover, due to the high similarity between hCoV-229E M(pro) and SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), we also performed the in silico analysis towards the second target, which showed results comparable to those obtained for hCoV-229E M(pro) and promising in terms of energy of binding and docking pose.","Citarella, Andrea; Gentile, Davide; Rescifina, Antonio; Piperno, Anna; Mognetti, Barbara; Gribaudo, Giorgio; Sciortino, Maria Teresa; Holzer, Wolfgang; Pace, Vittorio; Micale, Nicola",Int J Mol Sci,687,1

This paper aims to describe changes in participant engagement in the City Nature Challenge (CNC) in Tokyo. The CNC is a four-day international event held in April to document biodiversity in cities using an online citizen science platform, iNaturalist. To assess the impact of COVID-19, we compared the number of participants, observations, species, and identification rates in 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (during the pandemic). We also used cluster analysis to elucidate participation patterns, and we assessed changes in the geographical distribution of observation sites. The results showed: (1) the number of participants and observations decreased by 63% and 68%, respectively; however, the number of species was almost the same in the two years, and the identification rate increased 154% in 2020 relative to 2019. (2) The most enthusiastic participants contributed in similar amounts in 2019 and 2020, but participation by less enthusiastic volunteers drastically declined. (3) The spatial distribution of observation sites changed from cluster-like to scattered. Understanding participant engagement during the pandemic could help to improve data quality, reduce geographical bias in observations, maintain records, and recruit more users in future years.
