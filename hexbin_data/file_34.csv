43,Public awareness of risk factors for cancer among the Japanese general population: A population-based survey,2006-01-10,"BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to provide information on awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes among the Japanese general population. METHODS: A nationwide representative sample of 2,000 Japanese aged 20 or older was asked about their perception and level of concern about various environmental and genetic risk factors in relation to cancer prevention, as a part of an Omnibus Survey. Interviews were conducted with 1,355 subjects (609 men and 746 women). RESULTS: Among 12 risk factor candidates, the attributable fraction of cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection was considered highest (51%), followed by that of tobacco smoking (43%), stress (39%), and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (37%). On the other hand, the attributable fractions of cancer by charred fish and meat (21%) and alcohol drinking (22%) were considered low compared with other risk factor candidates. For most risk factors, attributable fraction responses were higher in women than in men. As a whole, the subjects tended to respond with higher values than those estimated by epidemiologic evidence in the West. The attributable fraction of cancer speculated to be genetically determined was 32%, while 36% of cancer was considered preventable by improving lifestyle. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes in the Japanese general population tends to be dominated by cancer-causing infection, occupational exposure, air pollution and food additives rather than major lifestyle factors such as diet.","Inoue, Manami; Iwasaki, Motoki; Otani, Tetsuya; Sasazuki, Shizuka; Tsugane, Shoichiro",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1351169/,34
759,Health System Resource Gaps and Associated Mortality from Pandemic Influenza across Six Asian Territories,2012-02-21,"BACKGROUND: Southeast Asia has been the focus of considerable investment in pandemic influenza preparedness. Given the wide variation in socio-economic conditions, health system capacity across the region is likely to impact to varying degrees on pandemic mitigation operations. We aimed to estimate and compare the resource gaps, and potential mortalities associated with those gaps, for responding to pandemic influenza within and between six territories in Asia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We collected health system resource data from Cambodia, Indonesia (Jakarta and Bali), Lao PDR, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. We applied a mathematical transmission model to simulate a “mild-to-moderate” pandemic influenza scenario to estimate resource needs, gaps, and attributable mortalities at province level within each territory. The results show that wide variations exist in resource capacities between and within the six territories, with substantial mortalities predicted as a result of resource gaps (referred to here as “avoidable” mortalities), particularly in poorer areas. Severe nationwide shortages of mechanical ventilators were estimated to be a major cause of avoidable mortalities in all territories except Taiwan. Other resources (oseltamivir, hospital beds and human resources) are inequitably distributed within countries. Estimates of resource gaps and avoidable mortalities were highly sensitive to model parameters defining the transmissibility and clinical severity of the pandemic scenario. However, geographic patterns observed within and across territories remained similar for the range of parameter values explored. CONCLUSIONS: The findings have important implications for where (both geographically and in terms of which resource types) investment is most needed, and the potential impact of resource mobilization for mitigating the disease burden of an influenza pandemic. Effective mobilization of resources across administrative boundaries could go some way towards minimizing avoidable deaths.","Rudge, James W.; Hanvoravongchai, Piya; Krumkamp, Ralf; Chavez, Irwin; Adisasmito, Wiku; Ngoc Chau, Pham; Phommasak, Bounlay; Putthasri, Weerasak; Shih, Chin-Shui; Stein, Mart; Timen, Aura; Touch, Sok; Reintjes, Ralf; Coker, Richard",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3283680/,34
1935,One Health – a strategy for resilience in a changing arctic,2015-09-01,"The circumpolar north is uniquely vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change. While international Arctic collaboration on health has enhanced partnerships and advanced the health of inhabitants, significant challenges lie ahead. One Health is an approach that considers the connections between the environment, plant, animal and human health. Understanding this is increasingly critical in assessing the impact of global climate change on the health of Arctic inhabitants. The effects of climate change are complex and difficult to predict with certainty. Health risks include changes in the distribution of infectious disease, expansion of zoonotic diseases and vectors, changing migration patterns, impacts on food security and changes in water availability and quality, among others. A regional network of diverse stakeholder and transdisciplinary specialists from circumpolar nations and Indigenous groups can advance the understanding of complex climate-driven health risks and provide community-based strategies for early identification, prevention and adaption of health risks in human, animals and environment. We propose a regional One Health approach for assessing interactions at the Arctic human–animal–environment interface to enhance the understanding of, and response to, the complexities of climate change on the health of the Arctic inhabitants.","Ruscio, Bruce A.; Brubaker, Michael; Glasser, Joshua; Hueston, Will; Hennessy, Thomas W.",Int J Circumpolar Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4558275/,34
2961,Characterization of Variability in Toxicokinetics and Toxicodynamics of Tetrachloroethylene Using the Collaborative Cross Mouse Population,2017-05-30,"BACKGROUND: Evaluation of interindividual variability is a challenging step in risk assessment. For most environmental pollutants, including perchloroethylene (PERC), experimental data are lacking, resulting in default assumptions being used to account for variability in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. OBJECTIVE: We quantitatively examined the relationship between PERC toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics at the population level to test whether individuals with increased oxidative metabolism are be more sensitive to hepatotoxicity following PERC exposure. METHODS: Male mice from 45 strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) were orally administered a single dose of PERC ([Formula: see text]) or vehicle (Alkamuls-EL620) and euthanized at various time points ([Formula: see text] /strain/time). Concentration–time profiles were generated for PERC and its primary oxidative metabolite trichloroacetate (TCA) in multiple tissues. Toxicodynamic phenotyping was also performed. RESULTS: Significant variability among strains was observed in toxicokinetics of PERC and TCA in every tissue examined. Based on area under the curve (AUC), the range of liver TCA levels spanned nearly an order of magnitude ([Formula: see text]-fold). Expression of liver cytochrome P4502E1 did not correlate with TCA levels. Toxicodynamic phenotyping revealed an effect of PERC on bodyweight loss, induction of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPAR [Formula: see text])-regulated genes, and dysregulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis. Clustering was observed among a) liver levels of PERC, TCA, and triglycerides; b) TCA levels in liver and kidney; and c) TCA levels in serum, brain, fat, and lung. CONCLUSIONS: Using the CC mouse population model, we have demonstrated a complex and highly variable relationship between PERC and TCA toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics at the population level. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP788","Cichocki, Joseph A.; Furuya, Shinji; Venkatratnam, Abhishek; McDonald, Thomas J.; Knap, Anthony H.; Wade, Terry; Sweet, Stephen; Chiu, Weihsueh A.; Threadgill, David W.; Rusyn, Ivan",Environ Health Perspect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5726344/,34
3024,Two sides of the same coin and two routes for improvement: Integrating resilience and the social identity approach to well-being and ill-health,2017-08-02,"We propose that resilience effectively helps people cope with stress, thus predominantly reducing the negative. However, we argue that individuals’ social identification has the potential to contribute to their well-being, thus fostering the positive. A two-wave survey study of 180 students shows that resilience is more strongly (negatively) associated with ill-health (i.e. stress and depression), whereas social identification is more strongly (positively) related to well-being (i.e. satisfaction and work engagement). We believe that it is necessary to see these two routes to improving people’s health as complementary, both in future research and for therapy and interventions.","Van Dick, Rolf; Ketturat, Charlene; Häusser, Jan Alexander; Mojzisch, Andreas",Health Psychol Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5779919/,34
3617,"Assessment of the health status and health service perceptions of international migrants coming to Guangzhou, China, from high-, middle- and low-income countries",2019-01-25,"BACKGROUND: China, which used to be an export country for migrants, has become a new destination for international migrants due to its rapid economic growth. However, little empirical data is available on the health status of and health service access barriers faced by these international migrants. METHODS: Foreigners who visited the Guangzhou Municipal Exit-Entry Administration Office to extend their visas were invited to participate in the study. Quantitative data were collected using electronic questionnaire in 13 languages. The participants were characterised by the income level of their country of origin (high-, middle- and low-income countries (HICs, MICs and LICs, respectively)), and the key factors associated with their health status, medical insurance coverage and perceptions of health services in China were examined. RESULTS: Overall, 1146 participants from 119 countries participated in the study, 57.1, 25.1 and 17.8% of whom were from MICs, HICs and LICs, respectively. Over one fifth of the participants experienced health problems while staying in China, and about half had no health insurance. Although the participants from HICs were more likely than those from MICs and LICs to have medical insurance, they were also more likely to have health problems. Furthermore, 43.0, 45.0 and 12.0% of the participants thought that the health services in China were good, fair and poor, respectively. Among the participants, those from HICs were less likely to have positive feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to report a quantitative survey of the health status, health insurance coverage, and health service perceptions of a diverse and surging population of international migrants in China. The findings call for more in-depth studies on the challenges presented by the increasing global migration to the health system.","Maimaitijiang, Remina; He, Qiangsheng; Wu, Yanan; Bouey, Jennifer Z.

3844,Emodin Rescues Intrahepatic Cholestasis via Stimulating FXR/BSEP Pathway in Promoting the Canalicular Export of Accumulated Bile,2019-05-22,"AIM: Bile salt export pump (BSEP) have been confirmed to play an important role for bile acid canalicular export in the treatment of cholestasis. In this study, we investigated the stimulatory effect of emodin on BSEP signaling pathway in cholestasis. METHODS: Cell and animal experiments were given different concentrations of emodin. The BSEP upstream molecule farnesoid X receptor was down-regulated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology or guggulsterones and up-regulated by lentivirus or GW4064. Real-time PCR and Western blotting was employed to detect the mRNA and protein levels of BSEP in LO2 cell, rat primary hepatocytes and liver tissue. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to examine the expression of BSEP in liver tissues. Rat liver function and pathological changes of liver tissue were performed by biochemical test and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. RESULTS: Emodin could increase the mRNA and protein expression of BSEP and FXR. When down-regulating farnesoid X receptor expression with the siRNA or inhibitor guggulsterones, and up-regulating farnesoid X receptor expression with the lentivirus or agonist GW4064, emodin could increase the mRNA level of BSEP and FXR and the protein level of BSEP, FXR1, and FXR2. Emodin also had a notable effect on rat primary hepatocytes experiment, rat pathological manifestation, BSEP, FXR1, and FXR2 positive staining in liver tissues and the test of liver function. CONCLUSION: Emodin has a protective effect and a rescue activity on cholestasis via stimulating FXR/BSEP pathways in promoting the canalicular export of accumulated bile.","Xiong, Xiao-Li; Ding, Yan; Chen, Zhi-Lin; Wang, Yao; Liu, Pan; Qin, Huan; Zhou, Li-Shan; Zhang, Ling-Ling; Huang, Juan; Zhao, Lei",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6540617/,34

12083,Foot ailments during Hajj: A short report,2015-02-07,"Cannabinoid CB(2) receptor (CB(2)) agonists are potential analgesics void of psychotropic effects. Peripheral immune cells, neurons and glia express CB(2); however, the involvement of CB(2) from these cells in neuropathic pain remains unresolved. We explored spontaneous neuropathic pain through on-demand self-administration of the selective CB(2) agonist JWH133 in wild-type and knockout mice lacking CB(2) in neurons, monocytes or constitutively. Operant self-administration reflected drug-taking to alleviate spontaneous pain, nociceptive and affective manifestations. While constitutive deletion of CB(2) disrupted JWH133-taking behavior, this behavior was not modified in monocyte-specific CB(2) knockouts and was increased in mice defective in neuronal CB(2) knockouts suggestive of increased spontaneous pain. Interestingly, CB(2)-positive lymphocytes infiltrated the injured nerve and possible CB(2)transfer from immune cells to neurons was found. Lymphocyte CB(2)depletion also exacerbated JWH133 self-administration and inhibited antinociception. This work identifies a simultaneous activity of neuronal and lymphoid CB(2)that protects against spontaneous and evoked neuropathic pain.","Cabañero, David; Ramírez-López, Angela; Drews, Eva; Schmöle, Anne; Otte, David M; Wawrzczak-Bargiela, Agnieszka; Huerga Encabo, Hector; Kummer, Sami; Ferrer-Montiel, Antonio; Przewlocki, Ryszard; Zimmer, Andreas; Maldonado, Rafael",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384863/,34

Here, we examined the role of UPF3B in the olfactory system. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis demonstrated considerable heterogeneity of olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) cell populations in wild-type (WT) mice, and revealed that UPF3B loss influences specific subsets of these cell populations. UPF3B also regulates the expression of a large cadre of antimicrobial genes in OSNs, and promotes the selection of specific olfactory receptor (Olfr) genes for expression in mature OSNs (mOSNs). RNA-seq and Ribotag analyses identified classes of mRNAs expressed and translated at different levels in WT and Upf3b-null mOSNs. Integrating multiple computational approaches, UPF3B-dependent NMD target transcripts that are candidates to mediate the functions of NMD in mOSNs were identified in vivo. Together, our data provides a valuable resource for the olfactory field and insights into the roles of NMD in vivo.","Tan, Kun; Jones, Samantha H; Lake, Blue B; Dumdie, Jennifer N; Shum, Eleen Y; Zhang, Lingjuan; Chen, Song; Sohni, Abhishek; Pandya, Shivam; Gallo, Richard L; Zhang, Kun; Cook-Andersen, Heidi; Wilkinson, Miles F",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7452722/,34
13040,Is the allocation of medical and health resources effective? Characteristic facts from regional heterogeneity in China,2020-06-08,"BACKGROUND: Facial skin care (FSC) is an important routine for Japanese women. Hand motions during FSC physically affect psychological state. However, it is very difficult to evaluate hand motions during personal and complex FSC. The objective of this study was to find out objective and quantitative parameters for hand motions during facial skin care (FSC). Women who enjoy and soothe during FSC (Enjoyment group (E group), n = 20) or not (non-enjoyment group (NE group), n = 19) were recruited by an advance questionnaire. The same lotion, emulsion, and cream were provided to all subjects, and they used sequentially in the same way as the women’s daily FSC. The motion of the marker on the back side of the right middle finger during FSC was tracked by a motion capture system. The heart rate variability (HRV) was also measured before and after FSC for evaluating psychological effect. RESULTS: The averaged acceleration (Avg. ACC), approximate entropy (ApEn), and power law scaling exponent (Rest γ) of the cumulative duration of slow motion from the sequential data of acceleration were evaluated. Compared to the NE group, the E group showed a lower Avg. ACC when using emulsion (p = 0.005) and cream (p = 0.007), a lower ApEn when using emulsion (p = 0.003), and a lower Rest γ (p = 0.024) when using all items, suggesting that compared to the NE group, the E group had more tender and regular motion, and sustainable slow motions, especially in the use of emulsion. In the E group, the low/high-frequency component of HRV decreased significantly after FSC, suggesting suppression of sympathetic activity (p = 0.045). NE group did not. For all subjects, ApEn and Rest γ showed significantly positive correlation with the increase in the low/high-frequency component of HRV after FSC (p < 0.01). ApEn showed significantly negative correlation with the increase in the high-frequency component of HRV after FSC (p < 0.05). Avg. ACC did not show significant correlation with them. These results suggested that the behavior of FSC influences the autonomic nerve system. CONCLUSIONS: ApEn and Rest γ are useful parameters for evaluating quality of hand motions during FSC.","Sakai, Shingo; Takatori, Ruako; Nomura, Mika; Uehara, Kuniaki",J Physiol Anthropol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7507946/,34
14593,The Effect of Commuting Time on Job Stress in Obese Men With Different Exercise Frequency in China,2020-12-14,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus has been commonly associated with poor surgical outcomes. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the impact of diabetes on postoperative complications following colorectal surgery. METHODS: Medline, Embase and China National Knowledge Infrastructure electronic databases were reviewed from inception until May 9th 2020. Meta-analysis of proportions and comparative meta-analysis were conducted. Studies that involved patients with diabetes mellitus having colorectal surgery, with the inclusion of patients without a history of diabetes as a control, were selected. The outcomes measured were postoperative complications. RESULTS: Fifty-five studies with a total of 666,886 patients comprising 93,173 patients with diabetes and 573,713 patients without diabetes were included. Anastomotic leak (OR 2.407; 95% CI 1.837–3.155; p < 0.001), surgical site infections (OR 1.979; 95% CI 1.636–2.394; p < 0.001), urinary complications (OR 1.687; 95% CI 1.210–2.353; p = 0.002), and hospital readmissions (OR 1.406; 95% CI 1.349–1.466; p < 0.001) were found to be significantly higher amongst patients with diabetes following colorectal surgery. The incidence of septicemia, intra-abdominal infections, mechanical failure of wound healing comprising wound dehiscence and disruption, pulmonary complications, reoperation, and 30-day mortality were not significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis and systematic review found a higher incidence of postoperative complications including anastomotic leaks and a higher re-admission rate. Risk profiling for diabetes prior to surgery and perioperative optimization for patients with diabetes is critical to improve surgical outcomes.

15285,“It makes me feel not so alone”: features of the Choose to Move physical activity intervention that reduce loneliness in older adults,2021-02-06,"PURPOSE: Education in airway management is a fundamental component of anesthesiology training programs. There has been a shift towards the use of simulation models of higher fidelity for education in airway management. The goal of this study was to create a novel cadaveric model of a simulated parapharyngeal abscess with features of a difficult airway such as distorted anatomy and narrow airway passages presenting as stridor. The model was further assessed for its suitability for enhanced experiential learning in the management of difficult airways. METHODS: Cadaver heads were modified surgically to simulate parapharyngeal abscess. Airtight torso of the cadaver was connected to an Oxylog ventilator to simulate respiratory movements—the opening and closing of air channels with breaths in a patient with parapharyngeal abscess. Advanced airway workshop facilitators conducted directed one-to-one learning, and provided feedback to participants. A paper-based feedback was obtained from 72 participants on their confidence level, and the realism, attractiveness, beneficial, and difficulty levels of the simulated cadaveric models. RESULTS: The modified cadavers were reliable in simulating difficult airways. The majority of participants (91%) reported an increase in confidence level for management of the difficult airway after the experience with the modified cadavers and found the models realistic (93%), attractive (92%), beneficial (93%), and difficult (85%). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical modifications of cadavers to simulate difficult airways such as parapharyngeal abscess with edema and stridor can be incorporated into advanced airway management courses to enhance experiential learning in airway management by awake fibreoptic intubation, and promote patient safety.

Patients with and without AP were compared by two risk stratification models: (1) a multivariate regression analysis using propensity score to adjust for confounding and (2) a propensity-matched nested case-control study. RESULTS: A total of 346 patients were enrolled in the cohort study, 29 of whom (8.4%) were diagnosed as AP. There was no significant difference between patients with and without AP with regards to common risk factors and presenting signs/symptoms other than gastrointestinal symptoms (p < 0.01).

18098,Data element mapping to analyze fit for use of three XML standards for health workforce tracking,2021-06-05,"Trazodone is a widely used antidepressant that is also useful in the control of agitation and insomnia in Alzheimer's disease. This drug is now recognized as having a new mechanism of action, an effect on the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, restoring protein translation and slowing neurodegenerative progression in mice. This mechanism may have a role in dementia-modifying treatment. To explore the effects of trazodone on human cognition and to search for clinical evidence of its putative benefits in human neurodegenerative diseases, a systematic review was conducted for studies that evaluated the effect of a minimum dose of 25 mg of trazodone daily, for at least 1 week, on cognition in adult humans. The search was run in MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL from the Cochrane databases, yielding a total of 16 studies after selection. Overall, seven studies showed no effect of trazodone on cognition, five showed a beneficial effect by improving or reducing cognitive decline, and four evidenced impaired cognitive function. Our analysis highlights the possibility of a dose-independent dual effect of trazodone on human cognition, with acute utilization associated with impaired cognitive function and long-term use with preventing cognitive deterioration. There was no clinical evidence that trazodone could be used as a specific treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Future studies should explore the role of trazodone in the UPR pathway and the implications in neurodegenerative diseases in humans.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are closely associated with the expression level of downstream genes and various types of bioactivity, are regarded as one of the key regulators of cancer cell proliferation and death. Cell death, including apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis, plays a vital role in the progression of cancer. A better understanding of the regulatory relationships between lncRNAs and these various types of cancer cell death is therefore urgently required. The occurrence and development of tumors can be controlled by increasing or decreasing the expression of lncRNAs, a method which confers broad prospects for cancer treatment. Therefore, it is urgent for us to understand the influence of lncRNAs on the development of different modes of tumor death, and to evaluate whether lncRNAs have the potential to be used as biological targets for inducing cell death and predicting prognosis and recurrence of chemotherapy. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the various forms of cancer cell death, including apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis, and to describe the mechanisms of different types of cancer cell death that are regulated by lncRNAs in order to explore potential targets for cancer therapy.","Tang, Wenwen; Zhu, Shaomi; Liang, Xin; Liu, Chi; Song, Linjiang",Technol Cancer Res Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8293842/,34

A precise definition of the fibroblast remains elusive. Lung fibroblasts orchestrate the assembly and turnover of ECM to facilitate gas exchange alongside performing immune functions including the secretion of bioactive molecules and antigen presentation. DNA methylation is the covalent attachment of a methyl group to primarily cytosines within DNA. DNA methylation contributes to diverse cellular phenotypes from the same underlying genetic sequence, with DNA methylation profiles providing a memory of cellular origin. The lung fibroblast population is increasingly viewed as heterogeneous with between 6 and 11 mesenchymal populations identified across health and lung disease to date. DNA methylation has been associated with different lung fibroblast populations in health and with alterations in lung disease, but to varying extents. In this review, we will discuss lung fibroblast heterogeneity and the evidence for a contribution from DNA methylation to defining cell populations and alterations in disease.","Rajasekar, Poojitha; Patel, Jamie; Clifford, Rachel L.",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8391838/,34

A paired sample t test was used to determine the impact of the intervention on the students’ understandings and attitudes about IPE. RESULTS: Out of 800 invited students, 530 students responded to the pre-intervention RIPLS survey. A comparison of the pre-post intervention for the RIPLS subscales of teamwork and collaboration, professional identification, and professional roles showed a significant improvement of students’ attitudes with p-values 0.03, 0.00 and 0.00, respectively. All workshop moderators scored a median of 4 or 5 to the essential elements of IPE during intervention except for a median of 3 for group dynamics. CONCLUSION: The present data, derived from the application of a brief online educational intervention, underpins the readiness and positive attitudes of undergraduate medical students towards IPE. The positive impact of online intervention necessitates the development of a structured and unified IPE curriculum to enhance the receptiveness and application of IPE in the medical field.

21990,Health system and patient-level factors serving as facilitators and barriers to rheumatic heart disease care in Sudan,2021-10-02,"Advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) offer new prospects to improve the treatment of conditions with unmet medical needs. Kidney diseases are a current major health concern with an increasing global prevalence. Chronic renal failure appears after many years of impairment, which opens a temporary window to apply novel therapeutic approaches to delay or halt disease progression. The immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and pro-regenerative properties of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have sparked interest for their use in cell-based regenerative therapies. Currently, several early-phase clinical trials have been completed and many are ongoing to explore MSC safety and efficacy in a wide range of nephropathies. However, one of the current roadblocks to the clinical translation of MSC therapies relates to the lack of standardization and harmonization of MSC manufacturing protocols, which currently hinders inter-study comparability. Studies have shown that cell culture processing variables can have significant effects on MSC phenotype and functionality, and these are highly variable across laboratories. In addition, heterogeneity within MSC populations is another obstacle. Furthermore, MSCs may be isolated from several sources which adds another variable to the comparative assessment of outcomes. There is now a growing body of literature highlighting unique and distinctive properties of MSCs according to the tissue origin, and that characteristics such as donor, age, sex and underlying medical conditions may alter the therapeutic effect of MSCs. These variables must be taken into consideration when developing a cell therapy product. Having an optimal scale-up strategy for MSC manufacturing is critical for ensuring product quality while minimizing costs and time of production, as well as avoiding potential risks. Ideally, optimal scale-up strategies must be carefully considered and identified during the early stages of development, as making changes later in the bioprocess workflow will require re-optimization and validation, which may have a significant long-term impact on the cost of the therapy. This article provides a summary of important cell culture processing variables to consider in the scale-up of MSC manufacturing as well as giving a comprehensive review of tissue of origin-specific biological characteristics of MSCs and their use in current clinical trials in a range of renal pathologies.","Calcat-i-Cervera, Sandra; Sanz-Nogués, Clara; O'Brien, Timothy",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8488400/,34
25160,Workplace Health Promotion Interventions ConcerningWomenWorkers' Occupational Hazards,2008,"The nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses occupy the top of the upper respiratory tract and form pneumatic spaces connected with the atmosphere. They are located immediately beneath the base of the cranium, where crucial vital structures are harbored. From this region, very much exposed to airborne agents, arise some of the more complex and rare benign and malignant lesions seen in humans, whose difficulties in interpretation make this remarkable territory one of the most challenging in the practice of surgical pathology. Contents of this chapter cover inflammations and infections, polyps and pseudotumors, fungal and midfacial destructive granulomatous lesions, as well as benign, borderline, and malignant neoplasms. Among the neoplasms, emphasis is made on those entities characteristic or even unique for the sinonasal region, such as Schneiderian papillomas, glomangiopericytoma, intestinal- and non-intestinal-type adenocarcinomas, olfactory neuroblastoma, nasal-type NK-/T-cell lymphoma, and teratocarcinosarcoma. Moreover, recently recognized entities involving this territory, i.e., HPV-related non-keratinizing carcinoma, NUT carcinoma, and SMARCB1-deficient basaloid carcinoma, are also discussed in the light of their specific molecular findings.

29846,The Role of Hospitals in Disaster,2009-05-15,"Acute viral bronchiolitis is a common viral lower respiratory tract infection in young children. Most typically caused by respiratory syncytial virus in 70% of cases, the condition lasts for 4 to 7 days, with a prolonged cough in many. Children with comorbidity, particularly those born prematurely or with significant congenital heart disease, are at risk of more severe disease. Nasal obstruction progresses over 3 to 4 days to difficulty with feeding and increased work of breathing with hypoxemia. Crackles and/or wheeze may be auscultated. Apnoea may be a presenting sign in those less than 3 months of age. Viral load is highest at peak of symptoms and in those with more severe disease. Approximately 2% to 3% of all children are admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis. The differential diagnosis may include bacterial pneumonia, congenital lesions of the lung or heart, or an interstitial lung disease. There are no effective treatments, and admission is for feeding support (by nasogastric or intravenous fluids) or treatment of hypoxemia. Critical care support is required for some infants experiencing respiratory failure, though mortality rates remain unchanged. Practice within and between countries varies significantly and alignment of practice is a common goal of guidelines. Vaccines for RSV are in advanced development, as are several antiviral therapies for RSV. In most children, acute symptoms improve within 5 to 7 days and cough by 2 weeks. Recurrent wheeze is common following acute bronchiolitis and a good association with a diagnosis of asthma in childhood.","Cunningham, Steve",Kendig's Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152174/,34

32429,Thrive Health: a New Venture Connecting Patient Advocacy to Well-Being,2020-05-12,"Pooling layers are crucial components for efficient deep representation learning. As to graph data, however, it’s not trivial to decide which nodes to retain in order to represent the high-level structure of a graph. Recently many different graph pooling methods have been proposed. However, they all rely on local features to conduct global pooling over all nodes, which contradicts poolings in CNNs that only use local features to conduct local pooling. We analyze why this may hinder the performance of graph pooling, then propose a novel graph pooling method called Bottom-Up and Top-Down graph POOLing (BUTDPool). BUTDPool aims to learn a more fine-grained pooling criterion based on coarse global structure information produced by a bottom-up pooling layer, and can enhance local features with global features. Specifically, we propose to use one or multiple pooling layers with a relatively high retain ratio to produce a coarse high-level graph. Injecting the high-level information back into low-level representation, BUTDPool enhances learning a better pooling criterion. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over compared methods.","Yang, Jia-Qi; Zhan, De-Chuan; Li, Xin-Chun",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206281/,34

35243,A Study of Intersubjective Representations of Inferential Information in Health Crisis News Reporting,2020-04-08,"The pricing of financial options is usually based on statistical sampling of the evolution of the underlying under a chosen model, using a suitable numerical scheme. It is widely accepted that using low-discrepancy sequences instead of pseudorandom numbers in most cases increases the accuracy. It is important to understand and quantify the reasons for this effect. In this work, we use Global Sensitivity Analysis in order to study one widely used model for pricing of options, namely the Heston model. The Heston model is an important member of the family of the stochastic volatility models, which have been found to better describe the observed behaviour of option prices in the financial markets. By using a suitable numerical scheme, like those of Euler, Milstein, Kahl-Jäckel, Andersen, one has the flexibility needed to compute European, Asian or exotic options. In any case the problem of evaluating an option price can be considered as a numerical integration problem. For the purposes of modelling and complexity reduction, one should make the distinction between the model nominal dimension and its effective dimension. Another notion of “average dimension” has been found to be more practical from the computational point of view. The definitions and methods of evaluation of effective dimensions are based on computing Sobol’ sensitivity indices. A classification of functions based on their effective dimensions is also known. In the context of quantitative finance, Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) can be used to assess the efficiency of a particular numerical scheme. In this work we apply GSA based on Sobol sensitivity indices in order to assess the interactions of the various dimensions in using the above mentioned schemes. We observe that the GSA offers useful insight on how to maximize the advantages of using QMC in these schemes.","Atanassov, Emanouil; Kucherenko, Sergei; Karaivanova, Aneta",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304776/,34

40757,Health of refugees and migrants from former Soviet Union countries in the Russian Federation: a narrative review,2020-10-13,"[Image: see text] Directed evolution is a powerful tool for the selection of functional ligands from molecular libraries. Extracellular domains (ECDs) of cell surface receptors are common selection targets for therapeutic and imaging agent development. Unfortunately, these proteins are often post-translationally modified and are therefore unsuitable for expression in bacterial systems. Directional immobilization of these targets is further hampered by the absence of biorthogonal groups for site-specific chemical conjugation. We have developed a nonadherent mammalian expression system for rapid, high-yield expression of biotinylated ECDs. ECDs from EGFR, HER2, and HER3 were site-specifically biotinylated in situ and recovered from the cell culture supernatant with yields of up to 10 mg/L at >90% purity. Biotinylated ECDs also contained a protease cleavage site for rapid and selective release of the ECD after immobilization on avidin/streptavidin resins and library binding. A model mRNA display selection round was carried out against the HER2 ECD with the HER2 affibody expressed as an mRNA–protein fusion. HER2 affibody–mRNA fusions were selectively released by thrombin and quantitative PCR revealed substantial improvements in the enrichment of functional affibody–mRNA fusions relative to direct PCR amplification of the resin-bound target. This methodology allows rapid purification of high-quality targets for directed evolution and selective elution of functional sequences at the conclusion of each selection round.","Grindel, Brian J.; Engel, Brian J.; Hall, Carolyn G.; Kelderhouse, Lindsay E.; Lucci, Anthony; Zacharias, Niki M.; Takahashi, Terry T.; Millward, Steven W.",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7542843/,34

In the present study, we report the identification of a new strain of a Jatropha leaf curl Gujarat virus (JLCuGV), which encodes six ORFs with each one having RNA silencing suppressor activity. Therefore, three artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs; C1/C4, C2/C3 and V1/V2) were designed employing overlapping regions, each targeting two ORFs of JLCuGV genomic DNA and transformed in tobacco. The C1/C4 and C2/C3 amiRNA transgenics were resistant while V1/V2 amiRNA transgenics were tolerant against JLCuGV. The relative level of amiRNA inversely related to viral load indicating a correlation with disease resistance. The assessment of photosynthetic parameters suggests that the transgenics perform significantly better in response to JLCuGV infiltration as compared to wild type (WT). The metabolite contents were not altered remarkably in amiRNA transgenics, but sugar metabolism and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle showed noticeable changes in WT on virus infiltration. The overall higher methylation and demethylation observed in amiRNA transgenics correlated with decreased JLCuGV accumulation. This study demonstrates that amiRNA transgenics showed enhanced resistance to JLCuGV while efficiently maintaining normalcy in their photosynthesis and metabolic pathways as well as homeostasis in the methylation patterns.","More, Prashant; Agarwal, Parinita; Anand, Abhishek; Sanan-Mishra, Neeti; Agarwal, Pradeep K.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7806619/,34
46287,Shaming and Stigmatizing Healthcare Workers in Japan During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-02-07,"Endothelial cell dysfunction and fibrosis are associated with worsening of the prognosis in patients with cardiovascular disease. Pirfenidone has a direct antifibrotic effect, but vasodilatation may also contribute to the effects of pirfenidone. Therefore, in a first study we investigated the mechanisms involved in the relaxant effect of pirfenidone in rat intrapulmonary arteries and coronary arteries from normal mice. Then in a second study, we investigated whether pirfenidone restores endothelial function in the aorta and mesenteric arteries from diabetic animals. From 16–18-week old normal male C57BL/6 mice and normoglycemic (db/db+), and type 2 diabetic (db/db) male and female mice, arteries were mounted in microvascular isometric myographs for functional studies, and immunoblotting was performed. In rat pulmonary arteries and mouse coronary arteries, pirfenidone induced relaxations, which were inhibited in preparations without endothelium. In mouse coronary arteries, pirfenidone relaxation was inhibited in the presence of a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-l-arginine (L-NOARG), a blocker of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BK(Ca)), iberiotoxin, and a blocker of K(V)7 channels, XE991. Patch clamp studies in vascular smooth muscle revealed pirfenidone increased iberiotoxin-sensitive current. In the aorta and mesenteric small arteries from diabetic db/db mice relaxations induced by the endothelium-dependent vasodilator, acetylcholine, were markedly reduced compared to db/db + mice. Pirfenidone enhanced the relaxations induced by acetylcholine in the aorta from diabetic male and female db/db mice. An opener of K(V)7 channels, flupirtine, had the same effect as pirfenidone. XE991 reduced the effect of pirfenidone and flupirtine and further reduced acetylcholine relaxations in the aorta. In the presence of iberiotoxin, pirfenidone still increased acetylcholine relaxation in aorta from db/db mice. Immunoblotting for K(V)7.4, K(V)7.5, and BK(Ca) channel subunits were unaltered in aorta from db/db mice. Pirfenidone failed to improve acetylcholine relaxation in mesenteric arteries, and neither changed acetylcholine-induced transient decreases in blood pressure in db/db+ and db/db mice. In conclusion, pirfenidone vasodilates pulmonary and coronary arteries. In coronary arteries from normal mice, pirfenidone induces NO-dependent vasodilatation involving BK(Ca) and K(V)7 channels. Pirfenidone improves endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in aorta from diabetic animals by a mechanism involving voltage-gated K(V)7 channels, a mechanism that may contribute to the antifibrotic effect of pirfenidone.","Beck, Lilliana; Pinilla, Estéfano; Arcanjo, Daniel Dias Rufino; Hernanz, Raquel; Prat-Duran, Judit; Petersen, Asbjørn Graver; Köhler, Ralf; Sheykhzade, Majid; Comerma-Steffensen, Simon; Simonsen, Ulf",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7906977/,34

The present study aimed to analyze natural deaths occurring at an age of ≥ 65 years, since health vulnerability in this age group is gaining importance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Autopsy reports of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, University Hospital of the Goethe University Frankfurt/Main, Germany, were retrospectively evaluated regarding natural death cases of ≥ 65-year-olds in a time comparison (period I: 2000–2002; period II: 2013–2015). RESULTS: During both periods, a total of 1206 autopsies concerning this age group were performed. Among these, 404 cases (33.5%) of unnatural death and 39 cases (3.2%) of a combination of natural and unnatural death were recorded; in 94 cases (7.8%), the manner of death could not be elucidated. The majority (n = 669; 55.5%) included cases of natural death. In the largest group of these (n = 350; 52.3%), cardiac causes of death were predominant, followed by 132 (19.7%) respiratory and 47 (7.0%) abdominal causes of death. In addition, 37 (5.5%) cases of malignant neoplasms, 33 (4.9%) of ruptures of large vessels, 33 (4.9%) of cerebral, and 37 (5.5%) other cases of natural death were noted. A significant decrease of cardiac causes of death was observed in the comparison of periods I and II. In particular, there was a significant decrease in high-grade occlusive coronary sclerosis. Moreover, there were significant differences between both sexes. Men had significantly more bypasses, stents and heart scars and suffered a myocardial infarction about 10 years earlier than women. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study are largely consistent with the literature. The decrease in numbers of cardiac deaths may be attributed to increasingly better medical care and to a significantly higher rate of stent implantation. Especially in times of pandemics, the role of forensic gerontology will become more important.","Wach, A.; Faßbender, C.; Ackermann, H.; Parzeller, M.",Rechtsmedizin (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7938877/,34

56300,Does the Internet Use Improve the Mental Health of Chinese Older Adults?,2021-07-16,"The Mediterranean region is increasingly water scarce, with the food system being the largest driver of water use. We calculate the water resources related to food consumption in nine major Mediterranean countries, by means of the water footprint (WF), for the existing situation (period 2011-2013) as well as the Mediterranean and EAT-Lancet diets. We account for different food intake requirements according to gender and six age groups. These nine countries – Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco - represent 88% of the population of all countries bordering the Mediterranean. As first major observation, we find that the EAT-Lancet diet, a scientifically optimised diet for both nutrition and certain environmental indicators, requires less water resources than the Mediterranean diet, a culturally accepted diet within the region. In terms of water resources use, adherence to the former is thus more beneficial than adherence to the latter. As second major observation, we find that the EAT-Lancet diet reduces the current WF for all nations consistently, within the range -17% to -48%, whereas the Mediterranean diet reduces the WF of the European countries, Turkey, Egypt and Morocco within the range of -4% to -35%. For the Maghreb countries Tunisia and Algeria, the Mediterranean diet WF is slightly higher compared to the current WF and the proportions of food product groups differ. Such dietary shifts would be important parts of the solution to obtain the sustainable use of water resources in Mediterranean countries.","Vanham, Davy; Guenther, Susann; Ros-Baró, Marta; Bach-Faig, Anna",Resour Conserv Recycl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8216694/,34

MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted an anonymous online survey among more than 10 000 radiologists/technicians in Germany from January 5 to January 31, 2021. A total of 862 responses (head physicians, n = 225 [inpatient doctors, n = 138; outpatient doctors, n = 84; N/A, n = 3]; radiologic personnel, n = 637 [inpatient doctor, n = 303; outpatient doctor, n = 50; inpatient technician, n = 217; outpatient technician, n = 26; N/A, n = 41]) were received. Questions of approximation, yes/no questions, and Likert scales were used. RESULTS During the first/second wave, 70 % (86/123)/43 % (45/104) of inpatient and 26 % (17/66)/10 % (5/52) of outpatient head physicians agreed that they received financial support from the authorities but the majority rated the financial support as insufficient. During the first and second wave, 33 % (8/24) and 80 % (16/20) of outpatient technicians agreed that they were adequately provided with personal protective equipment. The perceived lack of personal protective equipment improved for all participants during the second wave.

Confirmed pathogenic Corynebactrium isolates were biotyped. Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) was performed followed by next-generation-based core genome-MLST and minimum spanning trees were generated. Subjects between 10 and 19 years of age were mostly affected (n = 95; 27.3%). Case fatality rates (CFR) were higher in males (19.4%), as compared to females (15.8%). The highest CFR (31.1%) was observed among those under 5, followed by the 40 to 49 age-group (25.0%). Nine samples corresponded to C. diphtheriae and 1 to C. ulcerans. Two Sequencing Types (ST), ST174 and ST697 (the latter not previously described) were identified among the eight C. diphtheriae isolates from Carabobo state. Cg-MLST revealed only one cluster also from Carabobo. The Whole Genome Sequencing analysis revealed that the outbreak seemed to be caused by different strains with C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans coexisting.

While the majority of cases in this reporting period were from Victoria (60%; 116/192), there continues to be a decrease in cases in this state resulting from public health interventions. During this fortnight, 66% (127/192) of all cases were reported as locally acquired, with the majority reported from Victoria (108/127). The highest proportion of overseas-acquired cases was reported in New South Wales (75%; 38/51), followed by Western Australia (22%; 11/51). Although testing rates declined, they remain high overall at 9.2 tests per week per 1,000 persons. There was variability in the testing rate by jurisdiction, with testing rates depending on the epidemic context. The overall positivity rate for the reporting period was 0.05%, with Victoria reporting a positivity rate of 0.08% for this reporting period. In all other jurisdictions the positivity rate was ≤ 0.06%.",,Communicable diseases intelligence,https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2020.44.83; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33087023/,34
64290,A scoping Review of tools used to assess patient Complexity in rheumatic disease.,2021-02-17,"BACKGROUND Awareness with recall under general anesthesia remains a rare but important issue that warrants further study. METHODS We present a series of seven cases of awareness that were identified from provider-reported adverse event data from the electronic anesthesia records of 647,000 general anesthetics. RESULTS The low number of identified cases suggests an under-reporting bias. Themes that emerge from this small series can serve as important reminders to anesthesia providers to ensure delivery of an adequate anesthetic for each patient. Commonalities between a majority of our identified anesthetic awareness cases include: obesity, use of total intravenous anesthesia, use of neuromuscular blockade, and either a lack of processed electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring or documented high depth of consciousness index values. An interesting phenomenon was observed in one case, where adequately-dosed anesthesia was delivered without technical issue, processed EEG monitoring was employed, and the index value suggested an adequate depth of consciousness throughout the case. CONCLUSIONS Provider-reported adverse event data in the immediate post-operative period are likely insensitive for detecting cases of intraoperative awareness. Though causation cannot firmly be established from our data, themes identified in this series of cases of awareness with recall under general anesthesia provide important reminders for anesthesia providers to maintain vigilance in monitoring depth and dose of anesthesia, particularly with total intravenous anesthesia.","Deis, Amanda S; Schnetz, Michael P; Ibinson, James W; Vogt, Keith M",BMC anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-020-00974-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32151241/,34

Raw EEG analysis provides direct neurophysiologic measurement of cerebral activity. The relationship between age and EEG has rarely been reported, thus the aim of the present study was to compare raw electroencephalography (EEG) among different age groups of surgical patients under general anesthesia with 1.0 MAC sevoflurane. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 135 patients aged 0-80 years old (ASA physical status I or II) undergoing surgery, who were divided into 6 groups: 1-12 months old (group 1), 1-3 years old (group 2), 3-6 years old (group 3), 6-18 years old (group 4), 18-65 years old (group 5), and 65-80 years old (group 6). Different raw EEG waves (alpha, delta, and theta) were compared for all subjects. RESULTS The BIS values in groups 1 to 6 were 52.2±12.7, 55.0±8.0, 44.5±7.3, 43.8±7.3, 44.2±6.2, and 49.1±6.2 respectively. Compared with groups 1 and 2 (52.2±12.7, 55.0±8.0), BIS values of groups 3, 4, and 5 (44.5±7.3, 43.8±7.3, 44.2±6.2, respectively) were lower (P<0.05). Theta frequency was observed in the 6 groups. The EEG frequencies in groups 1 to 6 were 6.0 (5.5-6.0), 6.0 (5.5-6.0), 6.0 (5.5-6.0), 6.0 (6.0-7.0), 6.3 (6.0-7.0), and 6.0 (5.1-6.0), respectively. Compared with group 6, EEG frequencies in groups 4 and 5 were higher (P<0.05). BIS value was significantly correlated with EEG frequency (R²=0.063, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Analyzing raw EEG waves provides more accurate judgement of depth of anesthesia, especially in pediatric cases in which monitors often provide misleading values.","Beekoo, Deepti; Yuan, Kaiming; Dai, Shuyang; Chen, Lifen; Di, Meiqin; Wang, Sicong; Liu, Huacheng; ShangGuan, Wangning",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.915640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31146277/,34

67769,The COVID-19 Pandemic as a Catalyst for More Integrated Maternity Care.,2020-11-01,"InGaAs-based photodetectors have been generally used for detection in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region. However, the epitaxial process used to grow these materials is expensive; therefore, InGaAs-based photodetectors are limited to space exploration and military applications. Many researchers have expended considerable efforts to address the problem of SWIR photodetector development using lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots (QDs). Along with their cost-efficient solution processability and flexible substrate compatibility, PbS QDs are highly interesting for the quantum-size-effect tunability of their bandgaps, spectral sensitivities, and wide absorption ranges. However, the performance of PbS QD-based SWIR photodetectors is limited owing to inefficient carrier transfer and low photo and thermal stabilities. In this study, a simple method is proposed to overcome these problems by incorporating CdS in PbS QD shells to provide efficient carrier transfer and enhance the long-term stability of SWIR photodetectors against oxidation. The SWIR photodetectors fabricated using thick-shell PbS/CdS QDs exhibited a high on/off (light/dark) ratio of 11.25 and a high detectivity of 4.0 × 1012 Jones, which represents a greater than 10 times improvement in these properties relative to those of PbS QDs. Moreover, the lifetimes of thick-shell PbS/CdS QD-based SWIR photodetectors were significantly improved owing to the self-passivation of QD surfaces.","Kwon, Jin-Beom; Kim, Sae-Wan; Kang, Byoung-Ho; Yeom, Se-Hyuk; Lee, Wang-Hoon; Kwon, Dae-Hyuk; Lee, Jae-Sung; Kang, Shin-Won",Nano convergence,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40580-020-00238-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803407/,34

In the advanced cancer setting, based on favorable results from phase III trials, everolimus is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, advanced neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin, and advanced hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer. Additional oncology indications for everolimus include renal angiomyolipoma with tuberous sclerosis complex and subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma. Although it is generally well tolerated, with most adverse events of mild to moderate severity and manageable, everolimus exhibits a distinct adverse event profile that warrants guidance for proper diagnostic and medical management. This guidance is particularly important given the potential for widespread long-term use of everolimus. This review will focus on the most relevant toxicities associated with mTOR inhibitors and on their management. Practical treatment recommendations are presented for stomatitis, noninfectious pneumonitis, rash, selected metabolic abnormalities, and infections. Provided these events are rapidly identified and treated, the vast majority should resolve with minimal effect on treatment outcomes and patients' quality of life.","Grünwald, Viktor; Weikert, Steffen; Pavel, Marianne E; Hörsch, Dieter; Lüftner, Diana; Janni, Wolfgang; Geberth, Matthias; Weber, Matthias M",Onkologie,https://doi.org/10.1159/000350625; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23689226/,34

This study derived and validated the Summit Score to predict mortality in people with COPD and cardiovascular risks. Methods SUMMIT trial subjects (N=16,485) ages 40-80 years with COPD were randomly assigned 50%/50% to derivation (N=8181) and internal validation (N=8304). Three external COPD validations from Intermountain Healthcare included outpatients with cardiovascular risks (N=9251), outpatients without cardiovascular risks (N=8551), and inpatients (N=26,170). Cox regression evaluated 40 predictors of all-cause mortality. SUMMIT treatments including combined fluticasone furoate (FF) 100μg/vilanterol 25μg (VI) were not included in the score. Results Mortality predictors were FEV1, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, age, smoking pack-years, prior COPD hospitalizations, myocardial infarction, heart failure, diabetes, anti-thrombotics, anti-arrhythmics, and xanthines. Combined in the Summit Score (derivation: c=0.668), quartile 4 vs 1 had HR=4.43 in SUMMIT validation (p<0.001, 95% CI=3.27, 6.01, c=0.662) and HR=8.15 in Intermountain cardiovascular risk COPD outpatients (p<0.001, 95% CI=5.86, 11.34, c=0.736), and strongly predicted mortality in the other Intermountain COPD populations. Among all SUMMIT subjects with scores 14-19, FF 100μg/VI 25μg vs placebo had HR=0.76 (p=0.0158, 95% CI=0.61, 0.95), but FF 100μg/VI 25μg was not different from placebo for scores <14 or >19. Conclusion In this post hoc analysis of SUMMIT trial data, the Summit Score was derived and validated in multiple Intermountain COPD populations. The score was used to identify a subpopulation in which mortality risk was lower for FF 100μg/VI 25μg treatment.

68650,How does job dissatisfaction interact with self-rated health in determining the risk of health-related job loss? Prospective findings from the Health and Employment After Fifty (HEAF) study.,2020-09-11,"The consumption of organic fresh produce has increased in recent years due to consumer demand for healthy foods without chemical additives. However, the number of foodborne outbreaks associated with fresh produce has also increased. Contamination of food with enteric viruses is a major concern because the viruses have a low infectious dose and high persistence in the environment. Human adenovirus (HAdV) has been proposed as a good marker of faecal contamination. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of the plaque assay (PA), real time PCR (qPCR) and integrated cell culture-RT-qPCR (ICC-RT-qPCR) for the recovery of HAdV from artificially and naturally contaminated fresh produce. Organic lettuce, strawberries and green onions were selected because these fresh products are frequently associated with foodborne outbreaks. The virus extraction efficiencies from artificially contaminated samples varied from 2.8% to 32.8% depending on the food matrix and the quantification method used. Although the HAdV recoveries determined by qPCR were higher than those determined by PA and ICC-RT-qPCR, PA was defined as the most reproducible method. The qPCR assays were more sensitive than the PA and ICC-RT-qPCR assays; however, this technique alone did not provide information about the viability of the pathogen. ICC-RT-qPCR was more sensitive than PA for detecting infectious particles in fresh produce samples. HAdV genome copies were detected in 93.3% of the analysed naturally contaminated samples, attesting to the common faecal contamination of the fresh produce tested. However, only 33.3% of the total samples were positive for infectious HAdV particles based on ICC-RT-qPCR. In conclusion, this study reported that HAdV can be an efficient viral marker for fresh produce contamination. Good detection of infectious HAdV was obtained with the ICC-RT-qPCR and PA assays. Thus, we suggest that the ICC-RT-qPCR and PA assays should be considered when quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) studies are required and to establish reliable food safety guidelines.","Marti, Elisabet; Barardi, Célia Regina Monte",International journal of food microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.04.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27127838/,34

Innovative solutions for scaling clinical genomics services are necessary if they are to transition from a niche specialty to a routine part of patient care. The expertise of specialists, like genetic counselors and medical geneticists, has traditionally been relied upon to facilitate testing and follow-up, and while ideal, this approach is limited in its ability to integrate genetics into primary care. As individuals, payors, and providers increasingly realize the value of genetics in mainstream medicine, several implementation challenges need to be overcome. These include electronic health record integration, patient and provider education, tools to stay abreast of guidelines, and simplification of the test ordering process. Currently, no single platform offers a holistic view of genetic testing that streamlines the entire process across specialties that begins with identifying at-risk patients in mainstream care settings, providing pretest education, facilitating consent and test ordering, and following up as a ""genetic companion"" for ongoing management.

All elective cases have been put off, but oncology cases need to be done to prevent progression of the disease. There is concern about minimally invasive surgery due to aerosol formation. Here we discuss how we have dealt with this in our colorectal surgery department taking into account current evidence about the danger of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery. Discussion: We report a case of 28 years old female patient with carcinoma rectum. The patient had near total intestinal obstruction. She was operated on utilizing laparoscopic anterior resection. The air seal (CONMED, Utica, NY) and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was utilized for safe gas evacuation. There is no evidence against laparoscopic surgery, which suggest viral transmission. One should take utmost precautions using N95 masks and personal protective equipment (PPE). Air filtration products like aerosol, HEPA filters will be of great aid in safe evacuation of gases. Conclusion: At present, there is no solid evidence to suggest viral transmission through surgical smoke. We believe due to effective smoke containment, less blood loss, and less postoperative stay, laparoscopy will be a non-inferior option than open surgical procedure. We advise taking all precautions for operating room staff to lessen the danger of transmission.","Pawar, Tushar; Pokharkar, Ashish; Gori, Jayesh; Pandey, Diwakar; Rohila, Jitender; Dsouza, Ashwin; Saklani, Avanish",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

72442,Using Informational Murals and Handwashing Stations to Increase Access to Sanitation Among People Experiencing Homelessness During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-11-19,"BACKGROUND The number of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) is predicted to escalate due to an aging population. International studies on prevalence and resource utilization of this patient group exist, but data are lacking from Scandinavian intensive care units (ICUs) with a relatively low number of ICU beds in relation to population. The primary aim was to identify prevalence of admissions requiring mechanical ventilation ≥7-21 days and prolonged mechanical ventilation >21 days, and their use of intensive care unit (ICU) bed days in Sweden. Secondary aims were to describe patient characteristics and outcomes. METHODS We obtained admissions ≥18 years with mechanical ventilation ≥7 days from the Swedish Intensive Care Registry and used open source registry data for calculation of prevalence and use of bed days of admissions with mechanical ventilation ≥7-21 days and prolonged mechanical ventilation >21 days. RESULTS Of the 39,510 ICU admissions to Swedish ICUs in 2017, mechanical ventilation ≥7-21 days accounted for 1,643 (4%) admissions; prolonged mechanical ventilation >21 days for 307 (0.8%) admissions. Of the 109,457 ICU bed days, 22 % were consumed by admissions experiencing mechanical ventilation ≥7-21 days and 10% by prolonged mechanical ventilation >21 days. ICU-mortality of both mechanical ventilation ≥7-21 and >21 days admissions was 21%. Admissions with mechanical ventilation ≥7 days had a median age of 65 years, and were dominated by males (64%). CONCLUSIONS Admissions to Swedish ICUs requiring mechanical ventilation ≥7-21days and prolonged mechanical ventilation >21 days, form a relatively small part of all ICU admissions but a significant part of ICU beds days. Prevalence of admissions, ICU bed days and ICU mortality were lower than reports from other countries, but predominated by elderly and male in accordance with other reports.","Cederwall, Carl-Johan; Naredi, Silvana; Olausson, Sepideh; Rose, Louise; Ringdal, Mona",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.08117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32843507/,34

The extent to which ischemia contributes to ischemia/reperfusion injury has not been thoroughly studied. After careful evaluation of intestinal tissue following 30 min of ischemia, we noticed significant local mucosal injury in wild-type mice. This injury was drastically reduced in C3-deficient mice, suggesting C3 involvement. Depletion of circulating complement with cobra venom factor eliminated, as expected, injury recorded at the end of the reperfusion phase but failed to eliminate injury that occurred during the ischemic phase. Immunohistochemical studies showed that tissue damage during ischemia was associated with increased expression of C3/C3 fragments primarily in the intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting local involvement of complement. In vitro studies using Caco2 intestinal epithelial cells showed that in the presence of LPS or exposure to hypoxic conditions the cells produce higher C3 mRNA as well as C3a fragment. Caco2 cells were also noted to produce cathepsins B and L, and inhibition of cathepsins suppressed the release of C3a. Finally, we found that mice treated with a cathepsin inhibitor and cathepsin B-deficient mice suffer limited intestinal injury during the ischemic phase. To our knowledge, our findings demonstrate for the first time that significant intestinal injury occurs during ischemia prior to reperfusion and that this is due to activation of C3 within the intestinal epithelial cells in a cathepsin-dependent manner. Modulation of cathepsin activity may prevent injury of organs exposed to ischemia.","Satyam, Abhigyan; Kannan, Lakshmi; Matsumoto, Naoya; Geha, Mayya; Lapchak, Peter H; Bosse, Robin; Shi, Guo-Ping; Dalle Lucca, Jurandir J; Tsokos, Maria G; Tsokos, George C",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1502287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27913632/,34

Among these is ISG15, the mechanistic roles of which in innate immunity still remain enigmatic. In the present study, we report that ISG15 conjugation is essential for antiviral IFN responses mediated by the viral RNA sensor MDA5. ISGylation of the caspase activation and recruitment domains of MDA5 promotes its oligomerization and thereby triggers activation of innate immunity against a range of viruses, including coronaviruses, flaviviruses and picornaviruses. The ISG15-dependent activation of MDA5 is antagonized through direct de-ISGylation mediated by the papain-like protease of SARS-CoV-2, a recently emerged coronavirus that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work demonstrates a crucial role for ISG15 in the MDA5-mediated antiviral response, and also identifies a key immune evasion mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, which may be targeted for the development of new antivirals and vaccines to combat COVID-19.","Liu, GuanQun; Lee, Jung-Hyun; Parker, Zachary M; Acharya, Dhiraj; Chiang, Jessica J; van Gent, Michiel; Riedl, William; Davis-Gardner, Meredith E; Wies, Effi; Chiang, Cindy; Gack, Michaela U",Nature microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-021-00884-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33727702/,34
74640,The Australian health system response to COVID-19 from a resilient health care perspective: what have we learned?,2020-12-09,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Recent studies strongly link nephrogenic systemic fibrosis to gadolinium administration for magnetic resonance imaging. In a recent advisory, the Food and Drug Administration stated that all gadolinium-containing chelates are potentially associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis; however, most reported cases are linked to gadodiamide (Omniscan) and gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist). Given the severe consequences of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, it is critical to define the risks associated with each gadolinium-containing chelate. The purpose of this study was to examine nephrogenic systemic fibrosis risk in a hemodialysis population exposed to gadoteridol (ProHance). DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & OBJECTIVES Appointment logs were used to generate a database of all long-term hemodialysis patients at the Dallas Veterans Affairs hospital since August 2001. These patients were then examined in the Veterans Affair's electronic medical record system for gadolinium exposure during magnetic resonance imaging from 2000 through 2007, a period during which gadoteridol was the sole contrast agent used. RESULTS A total of 141 patients were identified with 198 gadoteridol exposures. No cases of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis were identified. The observed frequency of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis was compared with the expected frequency (2.4%) using one-way chi(2) and binomial analysis, yielding a P < 0.05, indicating that the result was not explained by chance alone. CONCLUSIONS It is concluded that the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis with gadoteridol in patients who are on long-term hemodialysis may be lower than with gadodiamide and gadopentetate dimeglumine.","Reilly, Robert F",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.05721207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18287249/,34

METHODS The COVID-19 Imaging Registry Study Aachen (COVID-19-Bildgebungs-Register Aachen, COBRA) collects data on imaging in patients with COVID-19. Two of the COBRA partner hospitals (RWTH Aachen University Hospital and Dueren Hospital) systematically perform reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs as well as LDCT in all patients presenting with manifestations that are compatible with COVID-19. In accordance with the COV-RADS protocol, the LDCT scans were prospectively evaluated before the RT-PCR findings were available in order to categorize the likelihood of COVID-19. RESULTS From 18 March to 5 May 2020, 191 patients with COVID-19 manifestations (117 male, age 65 ± 16 years) underwent RT-PCR testing and LDCT. The mean time from the submission of the sample to the availability of the RT-PCR findings was 491 minutes (interquartile range [IQR: 276-1066]), while that from the performance of the CT to the availability of its findings was 9 minutes (IQR: 6-11). A diagnosis of COVID-19 was made in 75/191 patients (39%). The LDCT was positive in 71 of these 75 patients and negative in 106 of the 116 patients without COVID-19, corresponding to 94.7% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [86.9; 98.5]), 91.4% specificity [84.7; 95.8], positive and negative predictive values of 87.7% [78.5; 93.9] and 96.4% [91.1; 98.6], respectively, and an AUC (area under the curve) of 0.959 [0.930; 0.988]. The initial RT-PCR test results were falsely negative in six patients, yielding a sensitivity of 92.0% [83.4; 97.0]; these six patients had positive LDCT findings. 47.4% of the LDCTs that were negative for COVID-19 (55/116) exhibited pathological pulmonary changes, including infiltrates, that were correctly distinguished from SARS-CoV-2 related changes. CONCLUSION In patients with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, LDCT can esablish the diagnosis of COVID-19 with comparable sensitivity to RT-PCR testing. In addition, it offers a high specificity for distinguishing COVID-19 from other diseases associated with the same or similar clinical symptoms. We propose the systematic use of LDCT in addition to RT-PCR testing because it helps correct false-negative RT-PCR results, because its results are available much faster than those of RT-PCRtesting, and because it provides additional diagnostic information useful for treatment planning regardless of the type of the infectious agent.","Schulze-Hagen, Maximilian; Hübel, Christian; Meier-Schroers, Michael; Yüksel, Can; Sander, Anton; Sähn, Marwin; Kleines, Michael; Isfort, Peter; Cornelissen, Christian; Lemmen, Sebastian; Marx, Nikolaus; Dreher, Michael; Brokmann, Jörg; Kopp, Andreas; Kuhl, Christiane",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.2020.0389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32762834/,34

Recent trials have suggested that its effect on long term functional outcome is neutral or negative, despite apparently promising preclinical data. Systematic review and meta-analysis is a useful tool to collate experimental data and investigate the basis of its conclusions. We searched three online databases to identify studies testing systemic hypothermia as monotherapy for treatment of animals subjected to a TBI. Data pertaining to TBI paradigm, animal subjects and hypothermia management were extracted as well as those relating to risk of bias. We pooled outcome data where sufficient numbers allowed and investigated heterogeneity in neurobehavioral outcomes using multivariate meta-regression. We identified 90 publications reporting 272 experiments testing hypothermia in animals subject to TBI. The subjects were mostly small animals, with well-established models predominating. Target temperature was comparable to clinical trial data but treatment was initiated very early. Study quality was low and there was some evidence of publication bias. Delay to treatment, comorbidity and blinded outcome assessment appeared to predict neurobehavioral outcome on multivariate meta-regression. Therapeutic hypothermia appears to be an efficacious treatment in experimental TBI, which differs from the clinical evidence.

77880,Occupational risk of COVID-19 by country of birth. A register-based study.,2021-10-06,"BACKGROUND Synthetic tissue adhesives (TA) are sometimes used in hernia repair surgery. This study compares the use of a new, noncommercial, long-chain cyanoacrylate (n-octyl) TA and Ifabond for mesh fixation. MATERIALS AND METHODS In two implant models in the rabbit, expanded polytetrafluorethylene meshes were fixed to the parietal peritoneum using a TA or tacks (intraperitoneal model), or polypropylene meshes used to repair partial abdominal wall defects were fixed with a TA or sutures (extraperitoneal model). Animals were euthanized 14 or 90 d postsurgery and implant specimens were processed for microscopy (labeling of macrophages and apoptotic cells), peritoneal fluid and biomechanical strength testing. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) were determinated in peritoneal fluid. RESULTS Mesothelial cell deposition on the intraperitoneal implants fixed using the new TA and Ifabond was adequate and similar IL-6 and TNF-α levels were detected in these implants. Intraperitoneal meshes fixed with tacks showed IL-6 overexpression. Three months after surgery, macrophage and apoptotic cell rates were higher for the intraperitoneal implants fixed with Ifabond versus the new TA or tacks. In the extraperitoneal model, reduced macrophage and cell damage responses were observed in the meshes fixed with sutures versus both TA. Tensile strengths were greater for the tacks versus TA in the intraperitoneal implants and similar for the sutures and TA in the extraperitoneal implants (90 d). CONCLUSIONS Both TA showed a good cell response in both models. Their use in an intraperitoneal location resulted in reduced tensile strength compared with the tacks. However, strengths were comparable when extraperitoneal implants were fixed with these adhesives or sutures.","Bellón, Juan M; Fernández-Gutiérrez, Mar; Rodríguez, Marta; Pérez-López, Paloma; Pérez-Köhler, Bárbara; Kühnhardt, Andree; Pascual, Gemma; San Román, Julio",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2016.09.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27993219/,34

This study aims to identify the key genes that cause cytokine storm in COVID-19 infected patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a difference analysis on the GSE147507 data set. The analysis results are combined with immune genes to obtain immune-related genes among the differential genes. Finally, GO enrichment analysis, PPI analysis, core gene identification, and ssGSEA enrichment analysis were performed on the new gene set. RESULTS A total of 232 differential genes were screened out. After merging with immune genes, a total of 29 immune-related genes were obtained. Further analysis revealed that the genes were enriched in 16 pathways, and the protein interaction network had a total of 29 nodes and 139 edges. After screening, the core gene was CXCL10. The ssGSEA results of CXCL10 showed that CD4 and CD8 immune-related signature were significantly enriched in high CXCL10 expression, and the samples with low CXCL10 expression were significantly enriched with monocytes and DC immune-related signature. CONCLUSIONS CXCL10 may be a key gene related to the cytokine storm of COVID-19 infection, and it is expected to become the therapeutic target.","Zhang, N; Zhao, Y-D; Wang, X-M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202007_21922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32706090/,34

Our goal was to compare the performance, in terms of PPF prevention, and safety of a radiofrequency (RF)-assisted transection device versus a stapler device in a porcine LDP model. METHODS Thirty-two animals were randomly divided into two groups to perform LDP using a RF-assisted device (RF group; n = 16) and stapler device (ST group; n = 16) and necropsied 4 weeks after surgery. The primary endpoint was the incidence of PPF. Secondary endpoints were surgery/transection time, intra/postoperative complications/deaths, postoperative plasmatic amylase and glucose concentration, peritoneal liquid amylase and interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentrations, weight variations, and histopathological changes. RESULTS Two clinical and one biochemical PPF were observed in the ST and RF groups respectively. Peritoneal amylase concentration was significantly higher in the RF group 4 days after surgery, but this difference was no longer present at necropsy. Both groups presented a significant decrease in peritoneal IL-6 concentration during the postoperative follow-up, with no differences between the groups. RF group animals showed a higher postoperative weight gain. In the histopathological exam, all RF group animals showed a common pattern of central coagulative necrosis of the parenchymal surface, surrounded by a thick fibrosis, which sealed main and secondary pancreatic ducts and was not found in ST group. CONCLUSIONS The fibrosis caused by an RF-assisted device can be at least as safe and effective as stapler compression to achieve pancreatic parenchyma sealing in a porcine LDP model.","Dorcaratto, Dimitri; Burdío, Fernando; Fondevila, Dolors; Andaluz, Anna; Quesada, Rita; Poves, Ignasi; Caceres, Marta; Mayol, Xavier; Berjano, Enrique; Grande, Luis",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-2952-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23584822/,34

However, individuals higher in prejudice are less interested in contact with diverse groups. This research investigates a novel method of encouraging interest in contact, particularly for those lower in the personality trait of Openness/Intellect, who tend to be higher in prejudice. Although long-term traits are relatively stable, momentary personality states show considerable within-person variation, and can be manipulated. In two experimental studies (total N = 687), we tested whether inducing higher state Openness would affect interest in contact. In Study 1, those lower in trait Openness/Intellect showed a positive indirect effect of condition on two outcome measures, via greater state Openness. In a larger sample with lower trait Openness/Intellect (Study 2), the indirect effect on the first outcome was replicated, regardless of disposition. The findings suggest that experiencing open states more frequently could encourage contact and lead to eventual reductions in prejudice.","Hotchin, Victoria; West, Keon",Personality & social psychology bulletin,https://doi.org/10.1177/01461672211030125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34292101/,34

The present work was conducted during the peak of restrictions in Germany (April/May 2020). In a convenient (N = 218) and representative sample (N = 715), we examined people's motivations to comply with these restrictions during the lockdown: Were they motivated by personal self-protection, or rather by solidarity with people in risk groups? Specifically, we investigated predictors of personal self-protection (compliance to protect the self against infection) and group-protection behaviours (compliance for reasons of solidarity in protecting people in risk groups). Results indicate that self- and group-protection result from different psychological processes: Whereas personal self-protection seems to be a form of coping with personal anxieties (epistemic and existential needs, personal threat), group protection is an intergroup phenomenon that is enabled by identification with a collective goal (common identity), the perception that society is capable of dealing with the virus (group efficacy), and concern for people in risk groups.

A specific and rapid diagnostic method is important for early identification. The reverse-transcription recombinase-aided amplification (RT-RAA) assay is a rapid detection method for several pathogens. Assays were performed within 5-15 min as a one-step single tube reaction at 39 °C. In this study, we established two RT-RAA assays for the S and orf1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2 using clinical specimens for validation. The analytical sensitivity of the RT-RAA assay was 10 copies for the S and one copy for the orf1ab gene per reaction. Cross-reactions were not observed with any of the other respiratory pathogens. A hundred percent agreement between the RT-RAA and real-time PCR assays was accomplished after testing 120 respiratory specimens. These results demonstrate that the proposed RT-RAA assay will be beneficial as it is a faster, more sensitive, and more specific tool for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Xue, Guanhua; Li, Shaoli; Zhang, Weiwei; Du, Bing; Cui, Jinghua; Yan, Chao; Huang, Lei; Chen, Lu; Zhao, Linqing; Sun, Yu; Li, Nannan; Zhao, Hanqing; Feng, Yanling; Liu, Shiyu; Zhang, Qun; Xie, Xianghui; Liu, Di; Yao, Hailan; Yuan, Jing",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c01032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32441935/,34
84288,Small Amounts of Physical Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic May Contribute to Improve Empathy in Young Adults: An Observational Study.,2021-05-18,"BACKGROUND Long-term dental stability is one of the main objectives following combined orthodontic and orthognathic surgical treatment. It is influenced by multiple factors such as surgical, patient-related, and orthodontic aspects. While recent reviews mainly focus on short-term dental changes (0.5-2 years), longer follow-up dental stability remains hardly reviewed. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term stability of dental and dentolabial changes following combined orthodontic and orthognathic surgical treatment with a minimum follow-up period of 5 years. SEARCH METHODS A systematic search was conducted up to December 2019 using Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case series with a minimum of 10 patients, which reported long-term dental stability following combined orthodontic and orthognathic treatment, were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Long-term changes were assessed for overjet, overbite, maxillary, and mandibular incisors' position and relationship of lip position to maxillary and mandibular incisors. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook. RESULTS Following the screening of 3178 articles, 11 studies were included (2 RCT, 9 retrospective) with a postoperative follow-up period ranging from 5 to 15 years. A decrease in overjet was observed for patients with skeletal class III malocclusion, whereas overjet increased in class II patients at long-term follow-up. Overbite increased in class II patients, whereas class III showed variable results. The lower incisor position was more stable vertically than horizontally; the latter showing more outcome variability. Dentolabial changes corresponded to the normal ageing process and results were not clinically significant after long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION Current evidence suggests variability of dental and dentolabial stability in both skeletal class II and III patients. Further prospective studies are required to develop guidelines for long-term follow-up assessment using computer tomography or cone-beam computed tomography imaging, before final conclusions can be drawn.

85814,COVID-19 Testing and Social Determinants of Health Among Disadvantaged Baltimore Neighborhoods: A Community Mobile Health Clinic Outreach Model.,2021-05-24,"PURPOSE Propofol clearance can be reduced when cardiac output (CO) is decreased. This clearance reduction may alter the pharmacokinetics of propofol and worsen the predictive performance of target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol. The head-down position (HDP) and CO2 pneumoperitoneum, which are required for robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP), may cause changes in CO. We investigated the predictive performance of propofol TCI during CO2 pneumoperitoneum in patients who underwent RALP in the HDP. METHODS Fifteen male patients received propofol TCI using the Diprifusor model. Propofol concentrations were measured at seven time points: (T1) 15 min after anesthesia induction; (T2) before the insufflation; (T3, T4, and T5) 15, 60, and 90 min, respectively, after insufflation in the HDP; (T6) before the release of pneumoperitoneum in the HDP; and (T7) 15 min after the release of pneumoperitoneum in the supine position. Cardiac index (CI) was assessed using an arterial pulse contour CO monitor. The predictive performance of propofol TCI was evaluated by calculating the performance errors (PE) in propofol concentrations for each data point. The relationship between CI and PE was examined. Median PE (MDPE) and median absolute PE (MDAPE) were calculated as measures of bias and accuracy, respectively. RESULTS A total of 104 blood samples were analyzed. There was significantly negative correlation between CI and PE. The predictive performance of propofol TCI during pneumoperitoneum in the HDP was acceptable (MDPE = - 1.5% and MDAPE = 18.8%). CONCLUSION The predictive performance of propofol TCI during RALP with CO2 pneumoperitoneum in the HDP was acceptable.","Ogawa, Tomoko; Obara, Shinju; Akino, Mitsue; Hanayama, Chie; Ishido, Hidemi; Murakawa, Masahiro",Journal of anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-020-02765-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32222907/,34

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a dramatic reduction in the number of hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction or stroke and a larger time interval from symptom onset to first medical contact have been reported. This study aims to verify the hypothesis that there would also have been a reduction of admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease during the Italian lockdown. MATERIAL AND METHOD s A multicenter, observational survey was conducted to collect data on hospital admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease due to vascular malformations throughout two-months (March 15th to May 15th); the years 2020 (COVID-19 Italian lockdown), 2019 and 2018 were compared. Cases were identified by ICD-9 codes 430, 431, 432.1, 432.9, 747.81 of each hospital database. The statistical significance of the difference between the event rate of one year versus the others was evaluated using Poisson Means test, assuming a constant population. RESULTS During the 2020 lockdown, the total number of admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease was 92 compared with 116 in 2019 and 95 in 2018. This difference was not significant. GCS upon admission was 3-8 in 44 % of cases in 2020 (41 patients), 39.7 % in 2019 (46 patients) and 28 % in 2018 (27 patients). CONCLUSION Reduction of admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease due to vascular malformations during the COVID-19 lockdown was not confirmed.

The elucidation of hCoV-EMC interactions with host cells is critical to our understanding of the pathogenesis of this virus and to the identification of targets for antiviral intervention. Here we investigated the viral and cellular determinants governing hCoV-EMC entry into host cells. We found that the spike protein of hCoV-EMC (EMC-S) is incorporated into lentiviral particles and mediates transduction of human cell lines derived from different organs, including the lungs, kidneys, and colon, as well as primary human macrophages. Expression of the known coronavirus receptors ACE2, CD13, and CEACAM1 did not facilitate EMC-S-driven transduction, suggesting that hCoV-EMC uses a novel receptor for entry. Directed protease expression and inhibition analyses revealed that TMPRSS2 and endosomal cathepsins activate EMC-S for virus-cell fusion and constitute potential targets for antiviral intervention. Finally, EMC-S-driven transduction was abrogated by serum from an hCoV-EMC-infected patient, indicating that EMC-S-specific neutralizing antibodies can be generated in patients. Collectively, our results indicate that hCoV-EMC uses a novel receptor for protease-activated entry into human cells and might be capable of extrapulmonary spread. In addition, they define TMPRSS2 and cathepsins B and L as potential targets for intervention and suggest that neutralizing antibodies contribute to the control of hCoV-EMC infection.","Gierer, Stefanie; Bertram, Stephanie; Kaup, Franziska; Wrensch, Florian; Heurich, Adeline; Krämer-Kühl, Annika; Welsch, Kathrin; Winkler, Michael; Meyer, Benjamin; Drosten, Christian; Dittmer, Ulf; von Hahn, Thomas; Simmons, Graham; Hofmann, Heike; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00128-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23468491/,34

This study aimed to describe our surgical procedure for LAPG-JI and assess its feasibility and safety. METHODS This was a retrospective study of 70 patients who had undergone proximal gastrectomy with jejunal interposition for gastric cancer in the upper third of the stomach between July 2007 and October 2016. Of these patients, 32 underwent LAPG-JI, and 38 underwent open proximal gastrectomy with jejunal interposition. Clinical characteristics and both surgical and postoperative outcomes were compared between LAPG-JI and open proximal gastrectomy with jejunal interposition. RESULTS The operation time was longer in the LAPG-JI group (189 vs 154 min, P < 0.001) and estimated blood loss was lower (30 vs 180 mL, P < 0.001). There were no differences in the rates of early (9.4% vs 13.2%) or late postoperative complications (12.5% vs 10.5%). No anastomotic leakage was observed in either group. In the LAPG-JI group, the time to first eating was shorter, and the white blood cell counts on postoperative days 1 and 7 and body temperature on postoperative day 3 were lower. The number of additional doses of postoperative analgesia was lower in the LAPG-JI group. Reflux esophagitis graded C according to the Los Angeles classification was observed in only one patient (3.1%) in the LAPG-JI group. CONCLUSION Although the operation time was longer in the LAPG-JI group, the procedure seemed to be feasible and safe.

METHODS By using two single-port platforms, selected patients were first operated by TaTME, and then a single-port laparoscopic surgery was introduced to assist and complete the abdominal portion. Short-term outcomes including perioperative outcome and pathologic results of these patients were evaluated. RESULTS Between July 2014 and March 2015, six patients with low rectal cancer (five males and one female) at a median age of 68 years were successfully operated in a median time of 360 min (range 310-420). The median estimated blood loss was 150 ml (range 50-800). In one patient, the spleen was removed because of a lesion identified preoperatively. Their postoperative recovery was uneventful except one acute myocardial infarction on postoperative day 3. Pathologic specimens showed negative margins and a complete excision of the mesorectum in all cases. The median number of harvested lymph nodes was 11.5 (range 4-12). At a median follow-up of 4 months (range 3-9), after ileostomy closure, none of the patients suffered from fecal incontinence.

100990,Late-occurring pulmonary pathologies following inhalation of mixed oxide (uranium + plutonium oxide) aerosol in the rat.,2010,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) induces severe respiratory impairment with a reported mortality rate of ~36% in humans. The absence of clinically available MERS-CoV vaccines and treatments to date has resulted in uncontrolled incidence and propagation of the virus. In vaccine design, fusion with the IgG Fc domain is reported to increase the immunogenicity of various vaccine antigens. However, limited reports have documented the potential negative effects of Fc fusion on vaccine antigens. To determine whether Fc fusion affects the immunogenicity of MERS-CoV antigen, we constructed a Fcassociated MERS-CoV spike protein (eS770-Fc, 110 kDa), whereby human IgG4 Fc domain was fused to MERS-CoV spike protein (eS770) via a Gly/Pro linker using baculovirus as the expression system. For comparative analyses, two eS770 proteins lacking the IgG4 Fc domain were generated using the IdeS protease (eS770-ΔFc) or His tag attachment (eS770-His) and the immunogenicity of the above constructs were examined following intramuscular immunization in mice. Contrary to expectations, non-Fc spike proteins (eS770-ΔFc, eS770-His; 90 kDa) showed higher immunogenicity than the Fc fusion protein (eS770-Fc). Moreover, unlike non- Fc spike proteins, eS770-Fc immunization did not elicit neutralizing antibodies against MERSCoV. The lower immunogenicity of Fc-fused eS770 was related to alterations in the structural conformation of the spike protein. Taken together, our results indicate that IgG Fc fusion reduces the immunogenicity of eS770 by interfering with the proper folding structure.","Chun, Jungmin; Cho, Yeondong; Park, Ki Hoon; Choi, Hanul; Cho, Hansam; Lee, Hee-Jung; Jang, Hyun; Kim, Kyung Hyun; Oh, Yu-Kyoung; Kim, Young Bong",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.1903.03043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982320/,34
102611,Framework for understanding health inequalities over the life course: the embodiment dynamic and biological mechanisms of exogenous and endogenous origin.,2021-08-10,"BACKGROUND Despite the widespread institution of modern massive transfusion protocols with balanced blood product ratios, survival for patients with traumatic hemorrhage receiving ultramassive transfusion (UMT) (defined as ≥20 U of packed red blood cells [RBCs]) in 24 hours) remains low and resource consumption remains high. Therefore, we aimed to identify factors associated with mortality in trauma patients receiving UMT in the modern resuscitation era. METHODS An Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma multicenter retrospective study of 461 trauma patients from 17 trauma centers who received ≥20 U of RBCs in 24 hours was performed (2014-2019). Multivariable logistic regression and Classification and Regression Tree analysis were used to identify clinical characteristics associated with mortality. RESULTS The 461 patients were young (median age, 35 years), male (82%), severely injured (median Injury Severity Score, 33), in shock (median shock index, 1.2; base excess, -9), and transfused a median of 29 U of RBCs, 22 U of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 24 U of platelets (PLT). Mortality was 46% at 24 hours and 65% at discharge. Transfusion of RBC/FFP ≥1.5:1 or RBC/PLT ≥1.5:1 was significantly associated with mortality, most pronounced for the 18% of patients who received both RBC/PLT and RBC/FFP ≥1.5:1 (odds ratios, 3.11 and 2.81 for mortality at 24 hours and discharge; both p < 0.01). Classification and Regression Tree identified that age older than 50 years, low initial Glasgow Coma Scale, thrombocytopenia, and resuscitative thoracotomy were associated with low likelihood of survival (14-26%), while absence of these factors was associated with the highest survival (71%). CONCLUSION Despite modern massive transfusion protocols, one half of trauma patients receiving UMT are transfused with either RBC/FFP or RBC/PLT in unbalanced ratios ≥1.5:1, with increased associated mortality. Maintaining focus on balanced ratios during UMT is critical, and consideration of advanced age, poor initial mental status, thrombocytopenia, and resuscitative thoracotomy can aid in prognostication.

103483,Adolescents' digital screen time as a concern for health and well-being? Device type and context matter.,2021-03-26,"BACKGROUND Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the deadliest diseases in developed countries. Treatments following early AD detection can significantly delay institutionalisation and extend patients' independence. There has been a growing focus on early AD detection using artificial intelligence. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven revolutionary for image-based applications and have been applied to brain scans. In recent years, studies have utilised two-dimensional (2D) CNNs on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for AD detection. To apply a 2D CNN on three-dimensional (3D) MRI volumes, each MRI scan is split into 2D image slices. A CNN is trained over the image slices by calculating a loss function between each subject's label and each image slice's predicted output. Although 2D CNNs can discover spatial dependencies in an image slice, they cannot understand the temporal dependencies among 2D image slices in a 3D MRI volume. This study aims to resolve this issue by modelling the sequence of MRI features produced by a CNN with deep sequence-based networks for AD detection. METHOD The CNN utilised in this paper was ResNet-18 pre-trained on an ImageNet dataset. The employed sequence-based models were the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and different types of recurrent neural networks. Several deep sequence-based models and configurations were implemented and compared for AD detection. RESULTS Our proposed TCN model achieved the best classification performance with 91.78% accuracy, 91.56% sensitivity and 92% specificity. CONCLUSION Our results show that applying sequence-based models can improve the classification accuracy of 2D and 3D CNNs for AD detection by up to 10%.","Ebrahimi, Amir; Luo, Suhuai; Chiong, Raymond",Computers in biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118752/,34

105858,"Health Reform in the Midst of a Social and Political Crisis in Chile, 2019-2020.",2020-01-01,"Virus neutralization assays measure neutralizing antibodies in serum and plasma, and the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is considered the gold standard for measuring levels of these antibodies for many viral diseases. We have developed procedures for the standard PRNT, microneutralization assay (MNA) and pseudotyped virus neutralization assay (PNA) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The MNA offers advantages over the PRNT by reducing assay time, allowing increased throughput and reducing operator workload while remaining dependent upon the use of wild-type virus. This ensures that all severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antigens are present, but Biosafety Level 3 facilities are required. In addition to the advantages of MNA, PNA can be performed with lower biocontainment (Biosafety Level 2 facilities) and allows for further increases in throughput. For each new vaccine, it is critical to ensure good correlation of the neutralizing activity measured using PNA against the PRNT or MNA. These assays have been used in the development and licensure of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca; Oxford University) and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen) coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines and are critical for demonstrating bioequivalence of future vaccines.","Bewley, Kevin R; Coombes, Naomi S; Gagnon, Luc; McInroy, Lorna; Baker, Natalie; Shaik, Imam; St-Jean, Julien R; St-Amant, Natalie; Buttigieg, Karen R; Humphries, Holly E; Godwin, Kerry J; Brunt, Emily; Allen, Lauren; Leung, Stephanie; Brown, Phillip J; Penn, Elizabeth J; Thomas, Kelly; Kulnis, Greg; Hallis, Bassam; Carroll, Miles; Funnell, Simon; Charlton, Sue",Nature protocols,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00536-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33893470/,34
106192,Piloting a City Health Adaptation Typology with data from climate-engaged cities: Toward identification of an urban health adaptation gap.,2020-11-13,"IMPORTANCE Although use of oral anticoagulants (OACs) is increasing, there is a substantial lack of data on how to treat OAC-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). OBJECTIVE To assess the association of anticoagulation reversal and blood pressure (BP) with hematoma enlargement and the effects of OAC resumption. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study at 19 German tertiary care centers (2006-2012) including 1176 individuals for analysis of long-term functional outcome, 853 for analysis of hematoma enlargement, and 719 for analysis of OAC resumption. EXPOSURES Reversal of anticoagulation during acute phase, systolic BP at 4 hours, and reinitiation of OAC for long-term treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Frequency of hematoma enlargement in relation to international normalized ratio (INR) and BP. Incidence analysis of ischemic and hemorrhagic events with or without OAC resumption. Factors associated with favorable (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-3) vs unfavorable functional outcome. RESULTS Hemorrhage enlargement occurred in 307 of 853 patients (36.0%). Reduced rates of hematoma enlargement were associated with reversal of INR levels <1.3 within 4 hours after admission (43/217 [19.8%]) vs INR of ≥1.3 (264/636 [41.5%]; P < .001) and systolic BP <160 mm Hg at 4 hours (167/504 [33.1%]) vs ≥160 mm Hg (98/187 [52.4%]; P < .001). The combination of INR reversal <1.3 within 4 hours and systolic BP of <160 mm Hg at 4 hours was associated with lower rates of hematoma enlargement (35/193 [18.1%] vs 220/498 [44.2%] not achieving these values; OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.19-0.42; P < .001) and lower rates of in-hospital mortality (26/193 [13.5%] vs 103/498 [20.7%]; OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37-0.95; P = .03). OAC was resumed in 172 of 719 survivors (23.9%). OAC resumption showed fewer ischemic complications (OAC: 9/172 [5.2%] vs no OAC: 82/547 [15.0%]; P < .001) and not significantly different hemorrhagic complications (OAC: 14/172 [8.1%] vs no OAC: 36/547 [6.6%]; P = .48). Propensity-matched survival analysis in patients with atrial fibrillation who restarted OAC showed a decreased HR of 0.258 (95% CI, 0.125-0.534; P < .001) for long-term mortality. Functional long-term outcome was unfavorable in 786 of 1083 patients (72.6%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with OAC-associated ICH, reversal of INR <1.3 within 4 hours and systolic BP <160 mm Hg at 4 hours were associated with lower rates of hematoma enlargement, and resumption of OAC therapy was associated with lower risk of ischemic events. These findings require replication and assessment in prospective studies.

108113,"Looking back from 2020, how cannabis use and related behaviours changed in Canada.",2021-04-21,"BACKGROUND The morbidly obese (MO) patient presents a unique challenge to pain control in the postoperative period due to associated comorbidities and the amplified impact of opiates. In order to reduce potential complications associated with narcotic use in the MO patient, multimodal analgesia has been advocated. In this study, we examined the effect of laparoscopic-guided transversus abdominis plane block (LG TAP) for further optimizing multimodal pain control. METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of 140 consecutive patients undergoing LSG without TAP block (pre-TAP group) compared to 131 patients undergoing LSG with LGTAP (TAP group). All operations were performed laparoscopically utilizing uniform clinical pathways. Baseline characteristics for both groups were comparable. Both groups received standardized anesthesia. Outcomes included time to postoperative ambulation, pain scores, PCA volume, length of hospital stay, utilization of oral opiate medications, and return to activity (RTA). RESULTS Pre-TAP versus TAP groups were comparable, mean age 42 years (p = 0.99), women 81.4% versus 87.8% (p = 0.148), mean BMI (kg/m2) 46 versus 45 (p = 0.394). Most patients ambulated within 2 h after arrival to the floor (87.9% vs. 76.3%, p = 0.013). On postoperative day (POD) 1, mean reported pain score (0-10) was 4.50 vs. 5.06 (p = 0.063) and a mean PCA morphine used for 24 h was 26.3 mL versus 26 mL, p = 0.35. Mean days of postoperative opiate medication were 2.19 versus 1.24 (p < 0.001). Return to activity was 2.81 versus 2.08 days (p < 0.001). When controlled for age, BMI, OR time, PCA volume used, and average pain score, TAP block was an independent predictor of earlier return to activities (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS LGTAP block following LSG is an additional valuable modality of pain control in the perioperative period. Our study shows that TAP block is associated with an earlier RTA and decreased opiate use in patients undergoing LSG.","Nasrawi, Ziyad; Beninato, Toni; Kabata, Krystyna; Iskandarian, Stella; Zenilman, Michael E; Gorecki, Piotr",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-07008-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31359196/,34
109774,Positionality of Community Health Workers on Health Intervention Research Teams: A Scoping Review.,2020,"OBJECTIVES Recent studies suggest that elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), created by hydrocephalus, can alter the lower limit of cerebrovascular autoregulation (LLA). Our objective in the present study was to determine if ICP elevation from cerebral venous outflow obstruction would result in comparable alterations in the LLA. METHODS Anesthetized juvenile pigs were assigned to one of two groups: naïve ICP (n = 15) or high ICP (>20 mmHg; n = 20). To elevate ICP through venous obstruction, a modified 5F esophageal balloon catheter was inserted via the right external jugular vein into the superior vena cava (SVC) and inflated to maintain an ICP of >20 mmHg. To calculate the LLA, gradual hypotension was induced by continuous hemorrhage from a catheter in the femoral vein. The LLA was determined by monitoring cortical laser Doppler flux (LDF). RESULTS The naïve and high ICP groups had LLAs of 45 mmHg (95% CI: 41-49 mmHg) and 71 mmHg (95% CI: 66-77 mmHg) respectively by LDF. The LLA was significantly different between the two groups and correlated significantly with ICP. DISCUSSION Elevated ICP from cephalic venous engorgement leads to an increase in the LLA. These findings suggest that pathologic processes resulting in cephalic venous outflow obstruction and intracranial venous congestion can acutely elevate ICP and may place the brain at risk for impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation.","Nusbaum, Derek; Clark, Jonathan; Brady, Kenneth; Kibler, Kathleen; Sutton, Jeffrey; Easley, Ronald Blaine",Neurological research,https://doi.org/10.1179/1743132814y.0000000397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24892946/,34

In this multicentric study, we report clinical and angiographic outcomes of 11 patients that underwent retreatment for 12 aneurysms initially treated with flow-diverter stents. METHODS The median patient age was 53 years. Aneurysms (median size, 7.3 mm) were located at the internal carotid artery in 9 cases, and at the posterior circulation in 3. Treatment strategies, complications, and angiographic outcome were retrospectively assessed. RESULTS Retreatment was feasible in all cases and performed by overlapping flow-diverter implantation. Overall, 12 side vessels were covered during retreatment, whereof 10 (83.3%) remained patent until mid-term follow-up. There were no further technical or symptomatic complications and no treatment-related morbidity. Angiographic follow-up (median, 17 months) showed improved aneurysm occlusion in all patients. Complete or near-complete aneurysm occlusion was achieved in 11 aneurysms (91.7%).

We did not detect any distal embolization during the injection and no angiographic occlusions, change in configuration, or delayed migration of the embolic material were found. In the inspected stent, no foreign material was noted. In four animals we successfully removed the stent with preservation of the integrity of the carotid artery.

We report a motion-sensitized driven-equilibrium MR imaging approach for the detection of a myeloperoxidase activity-specific gadolinium-containing imaging agent in experimental aneurysm models, which compensates for irregular blood flow, enabling vascular wall imaging in the aneurysm. MATERIALS AND METHODS A phantom was built from rotational angiography of a rabbit elastase aneurysm model and was connected to a cardiac pulse duplicator mimicking rabbit-specific flow conditions. A T1-weighted turbo spin-echo-based motion-sensitized driven-equilibrium pulse sequence was optimized in vitro, including the addition of fat suppression and the selection of the velocity-encoding gradient parameter. The optimized sequence was applied in vivo to rabbit aneurysm models with and without inflammation in the aneurysmal wall. Under each condition, the aneurysms were imaged before and after intravenous administration of the imaging agent. The signal-to-noise ratio of each MR imaging section through the aneurysm was calculated. RESULTS The motion-sensitized driven-equilibrium sequence was optimized to reduce flow signal, enabling detection of the myeloperoxidase imaging agent in the phantom. The optimized imaging protocol in the rabbit model of saccular aneurysms revealed a significant increase in the change of SNR from pre- to post-contrast MR imaging in the inflamed aneurysms compared with naïve aneurysms and the adjacent carotid artery (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS A diagnostic MR imaging protocol was optimized for molecular imaging of a myeloperoxidase-specific molecular imaging agent in an animal model of inflamed brain aneurysms.","Gounis, M J; van der Bom, I M J; Wakhloo, A K; Zheng, S; Chueh, J-Y; Kühn, A L; Bogdanov, A A",AJNR.

STUDY DESIGN A post-hoc analysis of secondary outcome measures of 2 prospective observational studies was performed. Neonates born at term and preterm via cesarean delivery were included if cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy measurements were performed during the immediate transition after birth and blood glucose concentrations were measured at 15-20 minutes after birth. Arterial oxygen saturation and heart rate were measured with pulse oximetry. cFTOE was calculated from arterial oxygen saturation and crSO2 values. crSO2 and cFTOE 15 minutes after birth were correlated with blood glucose concentrations. RESULTS Seventy-five infants were included. In 50 neonates born at term, crSO2 and cFTOE 15 minutes after birth were 83 ± 7.7% and 0.14 ± 0.08, respectively. In 25 neonates born preterm, crSO2 and cFTOE 15 minutes after birth were 80.2 ± 12.1%, and 0.15 ± 0.1, respectively. crSO2 and cFTOE correlated significantly with blood glucose concentrations in neonates born at term and preterm.

Of importance, the first oral immunotherapy product for the treatment of peanut allergy was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in January 2020. RECENT FINDINGS Suggested modifications to the practice of oral immunotherapy, some of which may have lasting impacts, were circulated as a result of the pandemic. New advances in pathophysiology, sustained unresponsiveness, quality of life, safety, and cost effectiveness were also published. SUMMARY During 2020, COVID-19 influenced the daily practice of allergy and immunology, with peanut oral immunotherapy being no exception. However, clinicians now have a FDA-approved treatment option for peanut allergy in children, a welcome development for a difficult disease.

In the treatment of high flow priapism, super-selective embolization is considered treatment of choice when conservative treatment fails as reported in the ""EAU Guidelines on Priapism"", but there are only few series reporting the outcome, the efficacy of different embolic materials and these studies are uncontrolled and relatively small. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to review the literature to outline the state of the art of this interventional treatment and to analyse the outcome of the different embolic agents. METHODS Through Medline database we searched all the English-language published articles related to priapism. Keywords were chosen according to MeSH terms. We selected case-series from 1990 to 2020 including at least five cases of high-flow priapism.The variables extracted from the selected articles were: number of patients, mean age, diagnostic imaging modality, mono or bilateral involvement of the arteries, embolization material, technical success, clinical success, complications, recurrence rate and type of reintervention, mean follow up, onset of erectile dysfunction. RESULTS We analyzed 11 papers.A total of 117 patients, mean age of 30 years, were studied during a period of 8 to 72 months. Technical success average was 99%, varying from 93 to 100%. Clinical success average was 88%, varying from 56 to 100%. After two or more treatments, resolution of priapism was obtained in all patients. No major adverse events registered. Recurrence rate of 21%(25/117) was observed, and only 4 pts underwent surgery. A total of 17 pts (15%) developed erectile dysfunction (ED). CONCLUSION Our data suggested comparable outcomes using different types of materials.In line with the last evidences we suggest that the choice of the embolic material should be selected basing on the expertise of the operator, the characteristic of the fistula and characteristic of the patients.","Arrichiello, Antonio; Angileri, Salvatore Alessio; Buccimazza, Giorgio; Di Bartolomeo, Francesco; Di Meglio, Letizia; Liguori, Alessandro; Gurgitano, Martina; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Papa, Maurizio; Paolucci, Aldo; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i10-s.10233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33245065/,34

We assessed VAP prevalence in ED intubated patients, feasibility of ED VAP prevention, and effect on VAP rates. METHODS This was a quality improvement initiative using a pre/post design. Phase 1 (PRE1) comprised patients before intensive care unit (ICU) bundle deployment. Phase 2 (PRE2) occurred after ICU but before ED deployment. Phase 3 (POST) included patients received VAP prevention starting at ED intubation. Log-rank test for equality and Cox regression using a Breslow method for ties were performed. Bundle compliance was reported as percentages. Number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated by ventilator day. RESULTS PRE1, PRE2, and POST groups were composed of 195, 192, and 153 patients, respectively, with VAP rates of 22 (11.3%), 11 (5.7%), and 6 (3.9%). Log-rank test showed significant reduction in VAP (χ2 = 9.16, P = .0103). The Cox regression hazard ratio was 1.38 for the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (P = .001), and the hazard ratio was 0.26 for the VAP bundle (P = .005). Bundle compliance >50% for head-of-bed elevation, oral care, subglottic suctioning, and titrated sedation improved significantly with introduction of a registered nurse champion. NNT varied from 7 to 11. CONCLUSIONS VAP was common for ED intubated patients. ED-based VAP prevention is feasible. We demonstrate significant reduction in VAP rates, which should be replicated in a multicenter study.","DeLuca, Lawrence A; Walsh, Paul; Davidson, Donald D; Stoneking, Lisa R; Yang, Laurel M; Grall, Kristi J H; Gonzaga, M Jessica; Larson, Wanda J; Stolz, Uwe; Sabb, Dylan M; Denninghoff, Kurt R",American journal of infection control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2016.05.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27665031/,34

Yet, these populations are significantly underrepresented in research. Methods We systematically reviewed the literature for published reports describing recruitment and retention of individuals from underrepresented backgrounds in ADRD research or underrepresented participants' perspectives regarding ADRD research participation. Relevant evidence was synthesized and evaluated for quality. Results We identified 22 eligible studies. Seven studies focused on recruitment/retention approaches, all of which included multifaceted efforts and at least one community outreach component. There was considerable heterogeneity in approaches used, specific activities and strategies, outcome measurement, and conclusions regarding effectiveness. Despite limited use of prospective evaluation strategies, most authors reported improvements in diverse representation in ADRD cohorts. Studies evaluating participant views focused largely on predetermined explanations of participation including attitudes, barriers/facilitators, education, trust, and religiosity. Across all studies, the strength of evidence was low. Discussion Overall, the quantity and quality of available evidence to inform best practices in recruitment, retention, and inclusion of underrepresented populations in ADRD research are low. Further efforts to systematically evaluate the success of existing and emergent approaches will require improved methodological standards and uniform measures for evaluating recruitment, participation, and inclusivity.","Gilmore-Bykovskyi, Andrea L; Jin, Yuanyuan; Gleason, Carey; Flowers-Benton, Susan; Block, Laura M; Dilworth-Anderson, Peggye; Barnes, Lisa L; Shah, Manish N; Zuelsdorff, Megan",Alzheimer's & dementia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trci.2019.09.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31921966/,34

The multiple etiologies of BRD and its complex web of risk factors necessitate a herd-specific intervention plan for its prevention and control on dairies. Hence, a risk assessment is an important tool that producers and veterinarians can utilize for a comprehensive assessment of the management and host factors that predispose calves to BRD. The current study identifies the steps taken to develop the first BRD risk assessment tool and its components, namely the BRD risk factor questionnaire, the BRD scoring system, and a herd-specific BRD control and prevention plan. The risk factor questionnaire was designed to inquire on aspects of calf-rearing including management practices that affect calf health generally, and BRD specifically. The risk scores associated with each risk factor investigated in the questionnaire were estimated based on data from two observational studies. Producers can also estimate the prevalence of BRD in their calf herds using a smart phone or tablet application that facilitates selection of a true random sample of calves for scoring using the California BRD scoring system. Based on the risk factors identified, producers and herd veterinarians can then decide the management changes needed to mitigate the calf herd's risk for BRD. A follow-up risk assessment after a duration of time sufficient for exposure of a new cohort of calves to the management changes introduced in response to the risk assessment is recommended to monitor the prevalence of BRD.","Aly, Sharif S; Karle, Betsy M; Williams, Deniece R; Maier, Gabriele U; Dubrovsky, Sasha",Animal health research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1466252320000201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323149/,34
126621,Creating a Scalable Physical Activity Breaks Resource Through the Multisensory Multilevel Health Education Model: H.Y.P.E. The Breaks!,2021-05-01,"Background Heart failure (HF) is a chronic and common condition with a rising prevalence, especially in the elderly. Morbidity and mortality rates in people with HF are similar to those with common forms of cancer. Clinical guidelines highlight the need for more detailed prognostic information to optimise treatment and care planning for people with HF. Besides proven prognostic biomarkers and numerous newly developed prognostic models for HF clinical outcomes, no risk stratification models have been adequately established. Through a number of linked systematic reviews, we aim to assess the quality of the existing models with biomarkers in HF and summarise the evidence they present. Methods We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, and the prognostic studies database maintained by the Cochrane Prognosis Methods Group combining sensitive published search filters, with no language restriction, from 1990 onwards. Independent pairs of reviewers will screen and extract data. Eligible studies will be those developing, validating, or updating any prognostic model with biomarkers for clinical outcomes in adults with any type of HF. Data will be extracted using a piloted form that combines published good practice guidelines for critical appraisal, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment of prediction modelling studies. Missing information on predictive performance measures will be sought by contacting authors or estimated from available information when possible. If sufficient high quality and homogeneous data are available, we will meta-analyse the predictive performance of identified models. Sources of between-study heterogeneity will be explored through meta-regression using pre-defined study-level covariates. Results will be reported narratively if study quality is deemed to be low or if the between-study heterogeneity is high. Sensitivity analyses for risk of bias impact will be performed.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Consecutive MWA procedures (n=113) for renal masses (October 2016 to September 2019) were maintained on a prospective database. Data describing patient, disease, procedure, complications and oncological outcomes were analysed. RESULTS Median age was 68 (33-85), 73% were male, and median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 0. Median tumour diameter was 25mm (IQR 20 - 32mm). In total 95% had renal mass biopsy, with histologically proven cancer in 75%. Median R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score was 7 (IQR 6-8). Median ablation time was 6 minutes, and length of stay was 1 day for 95%. Clavien-Dindo complication grades I, II, IIIb and IV occurred in 18%, 1.8%, 0.9% and 0.9% respectively. Median follow-up was 12 months and median renal function change was -4% (IQR -18-0%). One patient (0.9%) had local recurrence, treated with re-ablation. Two developed metastatic progression. Two (1.8%) had indeterminate findings on follow-up (one lung nodule and one possible local recurrence), managed with ongoing protocolised CT-surveillance. Post-procedure complications were associated with total ablation time (OR 1.152/min, 95% CI 1.040 - 1.277) and total ablation energy (OR 1.017/kJ, 95% CI 1.001 - 1.033). CONCLUSIONS We describe the largest UK series of MWA treatment for T1a/small T1b renal masses to date. MWA was well tolerated, with 95% discharged the following day and low complication/readmission rates. Current follow-up demonstrates favourable disease control. MWA appears to be safe and effective and should be considered in future prospective comparisons of treatments for T1a/small T1b renal masses.","John, Joseph B; Anderson, Moira; Dutton, Thomas; Stott, Mark; Crundwell, Malcolm; Llewelyn, Rhys; Gemmell, Andrew; Bufacchi, Rory; Spiers, Alexander; Campain, Nicholas",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.15224; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32871034/,34

We hypothesized that the magnitude of capsular injury would increase and the location of peak injury would vary depending on the number of dislocations.Seven fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were used. 7 x 11 grid of strain markers were affixed to the anteroinferior capsule.Each jointwas then mounted to a 6 degree-freedom robotic testing system. Marker tracking was performed following 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 dislocations to determine the non-recoverable strainas capsular injury. Following each dislocation, the magnitude of the maximum principal strain representing the non-recoverable strain in the inferior glenohumeral capsule wasquantified by comparing the strain marker positions following each dislocation.The peak value of non-recoverable strain statistically increased with the number of dislocations in five of seven specimens(p=0.0007).The capsular location that had the peak value of non-recoverable strain varied according to the number of dislocations, and from specimen to specimen.Non-recoverable strain was identified in the posterior capsule andanterior axillary pouch, which increased with the number of dislocations compared to the other regions of the capsule (p= 0.001- 0.012) by up to 16 %.

Reports on neurodevelopmental outcomes in paediatric TBI suffer from small sample size and varying outcome definitions in the neurocognitive domains tested. This protocol describes a systematic review and meta-analysis of paediatric TBI in the following key neurocognitive domains: executive function, perceptual-motor function, language, learning and memory, social cognition and complex attention. METHODS A comprehensive search comprising studies from Medline, Cochrane, Embase and PsycINFO published from 1988 to 2019 will be conducted. We will include studies on children ≤18 years old who suffer from mild, moderate and severe TBI as determined by the Glasgow Coma Scale that report neurocognitive outcomes in domains predetermined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition criteria. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomised controlled trials, case-control, cohort and cross-sectional studies will be included. References from systematic reviews and meta-analyses will be hand-searched for relevant articles. A meta-analysis will be performed and effect sizes will be calculated to summarise the magnitude of change in each neurocognitive domain compared at different timepoints and stratified by severity of TBI. Included studies will be pooled using pooled standardised mean differences with a random effects model to determine an overall effect. In the scenario that we are unable to pool the studies, we will perform a narrative analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not required for this study.The authors of this study will publish and present the findings in a peer-reviewed journal as well as national and international conferences.

Asthma may limit imaging for PE due to either worsened ventilation defects on ventilation/perfusion scan (VQ) or increased motion artifact on CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Methods: We identified adults evaluated for PE with VQ or CTPA from 2012-2016. Patients with chronic lung disease (other than asthma) were excluded. Studies were classified as negative, positive, or non-diagnostic. Follow-up of negative cases were reviewed to determine rate of repeat exam (within one week) and false-negative rate (defined as diagnosis of venous thromboembolism within 90 days). Results: We reviewed 19,412 adults (age 52 ±18 years, 70% women) evaluated for PE (60% with VQ, 40% with CTPA); 23% had history of asthma. Non-diagnostic results were comparable for those with and without asthma for both VQ (asthma 3.3%; non-asthma 3.8%; P = 0.223) and CTPA (asthma 1.6%; non-asthma 1.5%; P = 0.891). History of asthma was not associated with higher repeat exam after negative imaging for VQ (asthma 1.9%; non-asthma 2.1%; P = 0.547) or CTPA (asthma 0.6%; non-asthma 0.6%; P = 0.796), nor was history of asthma associated with higher false negative rate for VQ (asthma 0.4%; non-asthma 0.9%; P = 0.015) or CTPA (asthma 1.9%; non-asthma 1.5%; P = 0.347). Conclusion: History of asthma in the preceding ten years was not associated with impaired diagnostic performance of PE imaging for either VQ or CTPA.","Lazarus, Matthew; Kim, Yoel; Mathai, Bertin; Levsky, Jeffrey M; Freeman, Leonard M; Haramati, Linda B; Moadel, Renee M","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.120.242776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680927/,34
131219,Harnessing the Power of Networks of Care for Universal Health Coverage.,2020-09-01,"Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is the preferred surgical intervention for patients suffering from severe cardiorespiratory failure, also encountered in SARS-Cov-2 management. The key component of VV-ECMO is the double-lumen cannula (DLC) that enables single-site access. The biofluid dynamics of this compact device is particularly challenging for neonatal patients due to high Reynolds numbers, tricuspid valve location and right-atrium hemodynamics. In this paper we present detailed findings of our comparative analysis of the right-atrial hemodynamics and salient design features of the 13Fr Avalon Elite DLC (as the clinically preferred neonatal cannula) with the alternate Origen DLC design, using experimentally validated computational fluid dynamics. Highly accurate 3D-reconstructions of both devices were obtained through an integrated optical coherence tomography and micro-CT imaging approach. Both cannula configurations displayed complex flow structures inside the atrium, superimposed over predominant recirculation regimes. We found that the Avalon DLC performed significantly better than the Origen alternative, by capturing 80% and 94% of venous blood from the inferior and superior vena cavae, respectively and infusing the oxygenated blood with an efficiency of more than 85%. The micro-scale geometric design features of the Avalon DLC that are associated with superior hemodynamics were investigated through 14 parametric cannula configurations. These simulations showed that the strategic placement of drainage holes, the smooth infusion blood stream diverter and efficient distribution of the venous blood capturing area between the vena cavae are associated with robust blood flow performance. Nevertheless, our parametric results indicate that there is still room for further device optimization beyond the performance measurements for both Avalon and Origen DLC in this study. In particular, the performance envelope of malpositioned cannula and off-design conditions require additional blood flow simulations for analysis.","Rasooli, Reza; Jamil, Muhammad; Rezaeimoghaddam, Mohammad; Yıldız, Yahya; Salihoglu, Ece; Pekkan, Kerem",Journal of biomechanics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33895658/,34
131771,A Comparative Study of Residents' Responses Between the Epicenter and the Surrounding Areas in Hubei Province During the COVID-19 Outbreak.,2020-08-30,"AIM This paper aims to demonstrate how the rationale and delivery of cardiac rehabilitation (CR), in those countries with long term established standards of practice, has changed over the past eight decades. METHODS A narrative report based on the evolution of key published guidelines, systematic reviews and medical policies since the 1940s. RESULTS Case reports of the value of exercise in cardiac disease can be dated back to 1772. Formative groundwork for exercise-based CR was published between 1940 and 1970. However, it was not until the late 1980s that a large enough data set of controlled trials was available to show significant reductions in premature all-cause and cardiac mortality. Since the mid 1990s, cardiac mortality has been greatly reduced due to enhanced public health, emergency care and more sensitive diagnostic techniques and aggressive treatments. As a result, there appears to be an associated reduced potency of CR to affect mortality. New rationales for why, how and where CR is delivered have emerged including: adapting to a longer surviving ageing multi-morbid population, where healthcare cost savings and quality of life have become increasingly important. CONCLUSIONS In light of these results, an emerging focus for CR, and in some cases ""pre-habilitation"", is that of a chronic disability management programme increasingly delivered in community and home settings. Within this delivery model, the use of remote personalised technologies is now emerging, especially with new needs accelerated by the pandemic of COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONWith continued advances in medical science and better long term survival, the nature of cardiac rehabilitation has evolved over the past eight decades. It was originally an exercise-focused intervention on short term recovery and reducing cardiac and all-cause mortality, to now being one part of a multi-factor lifestyle, behavioural, and medical chronic disease management programme.Throughout history, the important influence of psycho-social well-being and human behaviour has, however, always been of key importance to patients.The location of rehabilitation can now be suited to patient need, both medically and socially, where the same components can be delivered in either a traditional outpatient clinic, community settings, at home and more recently all of these being supported or augmented with the advent of mobile technology.","Buckley, John P",Disability and rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2021.1921062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33989103/,34

The purpose was to investigate the mechanism of this complication and the efficacy of laparoscopic repair for preventing tubal occlusion. METHODS Between October 2006 and May 2010, we performed laparoscopic hernia repair in 100 girls (54 with a right hernia, including 2 with an inguinal ovarian hernia, 40 with a left hernia, including 3 with an inguinal ovarian hernias, and 6 with bilateral hernias). During laparoscopic repair we examined the anatomical relationship between the ovary, ovarian suspensory ligament, internal inguinal ring, and round ligament on both sides. RESULTS In 17 cases, 5 with an inguinal ovarian hernia and 12 without, the suspensory ligaments were ventrally dislocated and attached around the internal inguinal ring, and the ovary and fallopian tube were positioned near the internal inguinal ring and above the pelvic brim on the side of the original hernia. CONCLUSION This ventrally dislocated attachment may facilitate sliding of the ovaries and tubes into the hernial sac and induce tubal occlusion as a postoperative complication of inguinal hernia repair. The laparoscopic procedure makes it easy to prevent this complication.","Hirabayashi, Takeshi; Sakoda, Akiko; Kawano, Takafumi",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-012-3171-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23001135/,34
133893,Workflow Solutions for Primary Care Clinic Recovery During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Primer.,2020,"Colon cancer has been well studied using a variety of molecular techniques, including whole genome sequencing. However, genetic markers that could be used to predict lymph node (LN) involvement, which is the most important prognostic factor for colon cancer, have not been identified. In the present study, we compared LN(+) and LN(-) colon cancer patients using differential gene expression and network analysis. Colon cancer gene expression data were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas and divided into two groups, LN(+) and LN(-). Gene expression networks were constructed using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression. We identified hub genes, such as APBB1, AHSA2, ZNF767, and JAK2, that were highly differentially expressed. Survival analysis using selected hub genes, such as AHSA2, CDK10, and CWC22, showed that their expression levels were significantly associated with the survival rate of colon cancer patients, which indicates their possible use as prognostic markers. In addition, protein-protein interaction network, GO enrichment, and KEGG pathway analysis were performed with selected hub genes from each group to investigate the regulatory relationships between hub genes and LN involvement in colon cancer; these analyses revealed differences between the LN(-) and LN(+) groups. Our network analysis may help narrow down the search for novel candidate genes for the treatment of colon cancer, in addition to improving our understanding of the biological processes underlying LN involvement.

The present study was performed to assess intra-articular and systemic levels of antimicrobial peptides and proinflammatory cytokines as diagnostic markers for periprosthetic joint infection. METHODS Fifteen consecutive patients with staphylococcal periprosthetic joint infections and twenty control patients with aseptic loosening of total hip and knee replacements were included in this prospective, single-center, controlled clinical trial. Expression of the antimicrobial peptides human β-defensin-2 (HBD-2), human β-defensin-3 (HBD-3), and cathelicidin LL-37 (LL-37) was determined by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) in serum and joint aspirates. Proinflammatory cytokines were assessed in serum and joint aspirates with use of cytometric bead arrays. C-reactive protein in serum, microbiology, and histopathology of periprosthetic tissue served as the ""gold standard"" for the diagnosis of infection. RESULTS The antimicrobial peptides HBD-3 and LL-37 were significantly elevated in joint aspirates from patients with periprosthetic joint infection compared with patients with aseptic loosening, and the area under the curve (AUC) in a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was equal to 0.745 and 0.875, respectively. Additionally, significant local increases in the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-17A, interferon (IFN)-γ, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were observed to be associated with infection. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the combination of an antimicrobial peptide with another synovial fluid biomarker improved diagnostic accuracy; the AUC value was 0.916 for LL-37 and IL-4, 0.895 for LL-37 and IL-6, 0.972 for HBD-3 and IL-4, and 0.849 for HBD-3 and IL-6. In contrast, the only antimicrobial peptides and cytokines in serum that showed a significant systemic increase in association with infection were HBD-2, IL-4, and IL-6 (all of which had an AUC value of <0.75). CONCLUSIONS The present study showed promising results for the use of antimicrobial peptides and other biomarkers in synovial fluid for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection, and analysis of the levels in synovial fluid was more accurate than analysis of serum.","Gollwitzer, Hans; Dombrowski, Yvonne; Prodinger, Peter M; Peric, Mark; Summer, Burkhard; Hapfelmeier, Alexander; Saldamli, Belma; Pankow, Felix; von Eisenhart-Rothe, Rüdiger; Imhoff, Andreas B; Schauber, Jürgen; Thomas, Peter; Burgkart, Rainer; Banke, Ingo J",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

This article is a review of recent studies (2007 and 2008) on pneumonia in older people. RECENT FINDINGS The incidence of oropharyngeal dysphagia is increasing among older people. Biological markers of prognosis and severity do not normally offer additional relevant information to clinical data. Viral cause is increasingly relevant, and mixed infections are more severe and affect more old people. A new index has been developed (SMART-COP), which complements the existing Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and CURB-65 by improving identification of patients who require intensive care and vasopressor drugs. Reduction in antibiotic treatment duration is not associated with greater mortality or more readmissions. New developments regarding prevention of aspiration pneumonia and the utility of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are discussed. SUMMARY Pneumonia is increasingly caused by viral pathogens, and the pneumococcal and influenza vaccines may not be as effective as was first published. Recent studies have shown that aspiration is an increasing risk factor for pneumonia among older people.","Cabre, Mateo",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0b013e328326f571; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19276811/,34

While transcriptional dysregulation is observed in many cell types in the form of increased cell-to-cell variability, its generality to all cell types remains doubted. Here, we propose a new approach for analysing transcriptional regulation in single-cell RNA sequencing data by focusing on the global coordination between the genes rather than the variability of individual genes or correlations between pairs of genes. Consistently, across very different organisms and cell types, we find a decrease in the gene-to-gene transcriptional coordination in ageing cells. In addition, we find that loss of gene-to-gene transcriptional coordination is associated with high mutational load of a specific, age-related signature and with radiation-induced DNA damage. These observations suggest a general, potentially universal, stochastic attribute of transcriptional dysregulation in ageing.","Levy, Orr; Amit, Guy; Vaknin, Dana; Snir, Tom; Efroni, Sol; Castaldi, Peter; Liu, Yang-Yu; Cohen, Haim Y; Bashan, Amir",Nature metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-020-00304-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33139959/,34

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of this guideline on clinical practice and patient outcome. METHODS Moderately severe and severe adult AP patients, who were admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2016, were retrospectively included in the study. All enrolled patients were divided into two groups based on the publication date of the updated guideline, as the pre-guideline (Pre) group and post-guideline (Post) group. In-hospital case-fatality rates were compared between two groups after adjusting baseline features, including gender, age, etiology and disease severity. In addition, the associations between specific therapeutic approaches recommended in the updated guideline and in-hospital case-fatality rates were explored. RESULTS A total of 475 patients were enrolled in this study, including 273 (57%) in the Pre group and 202 (43%) in the Post group. The adjusted in-hospital case-fatality rate significantly decreased in the Post group (14.3% vs. 5.9%, OR 0.39, 95%CI 0.19-0.82). In the post-hoc analysis, the use of enteral nutrition was a protective factor against in-hospital death (OR: 0.08, 95%CI: 0.03-0.18), while open surgery showed an opposite effect (OR: 3.81, 95%CI: 1.06-13.74). Prophylactic antibiotics was not significantly associated with in-hospital death (OR: 1.00, 95%CI: 0.39-2.60). CONCLUSIONS There was a prominent transition in the management of moderately severe and severe AP after the release of the guideline in China in 2013, which made the prognosis better.","Bai, Xiaoyin; Jin, Meng; Zhang, Huimin; Lu, Bo; Yang, Hong; Qian, Jiaming",Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

However, EMG is typically invasive, expensive and difficult to use for untrained users. A possible solution is textile-based surface EMG (sEMG) integrated into clothing as a wearable device. This is, however, challenging due to 1) uncertainties in the electrical properties of conductive threads used for electrodes, 2) imprecise fabrication technologies (e.g., embroidery, sewing), and 3) lack of standardization in design variable selection. This paper, for the first time, provides a design guide for such sensors by performing a thorough examination of the effect of design variables on sEMG signal quality. Results show that imprecisions in digital embroidery lead to a trade-off between low electrode impedance and high manufacturing consistency. An optimum set of variables for this trade-off is identified and tested with sEMG during a variable force isometric grip exercise with n = 12 participants, compared with conventional gel-based electrodes. Results show that thread-based electrodes provide a similar level of sensitivity to force variation as gel-based electrodes with about 90% correlation to expected linear behavior. As proof of concept, jogging leggings with integrated embroidered sEMG are made and successfully tested for detection of muscle fatigue while running on different surfaces.","Shafti, Ali; Ribas Manero, Roger B; Borg, Amanda M; Althoefer, Kaspar; Howard, Matthew J",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnsre.2016.2633506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27913353/,34

A survey designed to evaluate the use of telephone consultation by HCPs, assessing its implementation, challenges and drawbacks. A web link survey conducted through SurveyMonkey was sent to HCPs across six UK Trusts the period of May 2020. The survey received 114 responses (84%) being doctors. 95% of respondents had not received training prior to engaging in telemedicine consultations. 64% were unaware of the updated General Medical Council guidance concerning remote consultations. The most common barrier in remote consultation was the inability to access patient records raised by 37% of respondents. However, 73% of respondents felt that patients understood their medical condition and the instructions given to them over the phone, and 70% agreed that videoconference consultations would add to patients care.

140660,Predictors of non-adherence to public health instructions during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-07-30,"BACKGROUND The standard treatment for mid- and low-rectal cancer is total mesorectal excision. Incomplete excision is an important predictor of local recurrence after rectal cancer surgery. Transanal TME (TaTME) is a new treatment option in which the rectum is approached with both laparoscopic and transanal endoscopic techniques. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence and localisation of residual mesorectal tissue by postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis and compare this between TaTME and laparoscopic TME (LapTME) patients. In addition, we assessed correspondence with histopathological quality. METHODS Two groups of patients with cT1-T3 rectal cancer who underwent TME surgery with primary anastomosis were included, each group consisting of 32 patients. Postoperative T2-weighted MRI of the pelvis was performed at least 6 months after TME surgery and evaluated by two radiologists independently. Residual mesorectum was defined as any residual mesorectal tissue detectable after TME. Localisation of the tissue was categorised in relation to height in the pelvis and position of the level of anastomosis. RESULTS Residual mesorectal tissue was detected in 3.1% of TaTME patients and of 46.9% in LapTME patients (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified only type of surgery as a significant risk factor for leaving residual mesorectum. Other known risk factors for incomplete TME, such as body mass index (BMI) and male gender, were not significant. No relation was seen between specimen quality and prevalence of residual mesorectum. CONCLUSIONS The completeness of mesorectal excision was significantly better with TaTME than with standard laparoscopic technique.","Veltcamp Helbach, M; Koedam, T W A; Knol, J J; Diederik, A; Spaargaren, G J; Bonjer, H J; Tuynman, J B; Sietses, C",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6279-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29967990/,34
140878,Time for time off? Secondary public holiday shows minimal net hospitalisation benefit.,2020-11-26,"In view of the rising prevalence of dengue virus and mixing of host and vector populations, complete full-length sequence determination of dengue strains isolated from different epidemic areas is important for the study of virus evolution, pathogenicity, vaccine efficiency and diagnosis. Based on the genomic analysis of 51 complete dengue virus sequences, all of which cocirculated in Thailand between 1974 and 2001, we report here the occurrence of homologous recombination in the NS5 nonstructural gene region of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) strains. In order to analyze those 51 virus sequences at one time, we chose to use a highly sensitive recombination detection program called RDP. When RDP detects a possible recombination event, further bootscanning and phylogenetic tree analyses are applied to these candidate sequences to identify this recombination event. We found that within the DENV-2 subfamily, the strain ThNH63/93 is the evolutionary product of a recombination event between ThNH62/93 and ThD2_0284_90 strains. The strain ThNH62/93 was identified as the major parent, while the strain ThD2_0284_90 was the minor parent. The recombination site was determined to localize between positions 7967 (± 36 nt) and 8283 (± 36 nt) with a significance level of p < 0.001. Our results showed, for the first time, that an intraserotype recombination event occurred between DENV-2 strains in the nonstructural gene region; by contrast, an interserotype recombination between different serotypes of dengue strains was not identified. This study thus supports the theory that homologous recombination plays a key role in dengue virus evolution.","Su, Ming Wei; Yuan, Hanna S; Chu, Woei Chyn",Intervirology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000327786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21821995/,34

The aim of this study was to explore availability and accessibility of bereavement services across the North-East of England and to highlight issues potentially applicable across the UK, at a time of unprecedented need due to the impact of COVID-19. METHODS Phase 1: an eight item, web-based survey was produced. A survey link was cascaded to all GP practices (General Practitioners) in the region. Phase 2: an email was sent to all services identified in phase 1, requesting details such as referral criteria and waiting times. RESULTS All 392 GP practices in the region were invited to participate. The response rate was 22% (85/392). Twenty-one per cent (18/85) of respondents reported that they do not refer patients, comments included 'not aware of any services locally'. A total of 36 services were contacted with 72% responding with further information. Most bereavement specific support was reliant on charity-funded services including hospices, this sometimes required a pre-existing link with the hospice. Waiting times were up to 4 months. CONCLUSIONS Although multiple different, usually charity-funded services were identified, awareness and accessibility were variable. This survey was conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, where complex situations surrounding death is likely to impact on the usual grieving process and increase the need for bereavement support. Meanwhile, charities providing this support are under severe financial strain. There is an urgent need to bridge the gap between need and access to bereavement services.","Wakefield, Donna; Fleming, Elizabeth; Howorth, Kate; Waterfield, Kerry; Kavanagh, Emily; Billett, Hannah C; Kiltie, Rachel; Robinson, Lucy; Rowley, Grace; Brown, Jolene; Woods, Elizabeth; Dewhurst, Felicity",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32967861/,34

After cell transplantation in hepatic sinusoids, perturbations in hepatic microcirculation along with changes in various liver cell types are among the earliest changes. Therefore, for advancing further concepts in cell engraftment we studied vascular and related events in the liver after transplanting syngeneic hepatocytes into dipeptidyl peptidase IV-deficient rats. We treated rats with vascular drugs to define whether deleterious cell transplantation-induced events could be controlled followed by improvements in transplanted cell engraftment and proliferation. We found cell transplantation altered liver gene expression related to vessel tone, inflammation, cell adhesion, thrombosis, or tissue damage/remodeling. This was due to hepatic ischemia, endothelial injury, and activation of neutrophils, Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells. Treatment of rats before cell transplantation with the angiotensin converting enzyme blocker, lisinopril, or angiotensin II receptor blocker, losartan, did not improve cell engraftment. By contrast, direct-acting nitroglycerine or prostacyclin improved cell engraftment and also kinetics of liver repopulation. These drugs lowered hepatic ischemia and inflammation, whereas pretreatment of rats with the dual endothelin-1 receptor blocker, bosentan, improved cell engraftment independently of hepatic ischemia or inflammation, without improving liver repopulation. However, incubation of hepatocytes with bosentan protected cells from cytokine toxicity in vitro and produced superior cell engraftment and proliferation in vivo. CONCLUSION Cell transplantation-induced changes in hepatic microcirculation contributed to transplanted cell clearances from liver. Vascular drugs, such as nitroglycerine, prostacyclin, and bosentan, offer opportunities for improving cell therapy results through superior cell engraftment and liver repopulation. Ongoing clinical use of these drugs will permit rapid translation of the findings in people.","Bahde, Ralf; Kapoor, Sorabh; Bandi, Sriram; Bhargava, Kuldeep K; Palestro, Christopher J; Gupta, Sanjeev",Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.26005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22899584/,34

Innovative recruitment strategies, onboarding and continuing education programmes, occupational safety measures, and burnout prevention interventions are documented solutions. The long-term effect of COVID-19 on oncology care worldwide is unknown, but immediate therapy interruptions, workforce consequences, and threats to standard oncology nursing practice are addressed here. Retention of experienced oncology nurses is crucial for future cancer control in all countries and must be addressed, particularly in resource-constrained countries with few oncology nursing staff and continuing out-migration of nurses to resource-rich countries. As the cancer burden worldwide increases, the future of the oncology nursing workforce is reflected in the call from the International Council of Nurses, Nursing Now, and WHO for nurses to move to higher levels of leadership, advocacy, and policy making (ie, national cancer control planning) and assume responsibility for their key role in achieving global goals for cancer control.","Challinor, Julia M; Alqudimat, Mohammad R; Teixeira, Tamara O A; Oldenmenger, Wendy H",The Lancet.

146924,COVID-19: A Comprehensive Review of Epidemiology and Public Health System Response in Nordic Region.,2021-03-03,"Background: Dysmenorrhea affects most reproductive-aged women. Common dysmenorrhea treatments vary in their effectiveness across individuals. Little is known about factors associated with perceived treatment ineffectiveness. The objectives of this study were to describe the perceived ineffectiveness of common pharmacological treatments for dysmenorrhea and investigate factors associated with perceived treatment ineffectiveness. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 678 women with dysmenorrhea (aged 14-42) provided data on perceived treatment ineffectiveness, dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes, demographics, clinical factors, and psychobehavioral characteristics. We used Fisher's exact tests to compare treatment ineffectiveness across three symptom-based phenotypes. We used logistic regressions to explore associations of phenotype, demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral correlates of perceived treatment ineffectiveness. Results: Percentages perceiving treatments as ineffective were 29.3%-35.6% nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 49.9% acetaminophen, and 39.3% combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). Factors associated with perceived ineffectiveness varied across treatments and included symptom-based phenotypes, clinical, and psychobehavioral factors. For ibuprofen and acetaminophen, women with severe (vs. mild) pain phenotype and higher number of chronic pain conditions were more likely to perceive the treatments as ineffective. For OCPs, women with severe pain (vs. mild) phenotype, comorbid gynecological condition, less anxiety, and worse depressive symptoms were more likely to perceive the treatment as ineffective. Conclusion: A significant percentage of women reported ineffectiveness of dysmenorrhea treatments. Phenotypes, clinical, and psychobehavioral factors were associated with treatment ineffectiveness. Future research should test if symptom-based phenotypes are associated with treatment effectiveness in clinical trials and investigate other factors that affect dysmenorrhea treatment effectiveness, so treatments can be tailored to individuals.","Chen, Chen X; Carpenter, Janet S; LaPradd, Michelle; Ofner, Susan; Fortenberry, J Dennis",Journal of women's health,https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2020.8581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33026968/,34

It forms the basis for further studies investigating the natural history of HRQL of dogs to inform the interpretation of interventional studies, but highlights the risks of relying on owner impression of health status. A previously published health-related quality of life (HRQL) instrument (VetMetrica™) that generates scores in four domains of quality of life in dogs - Energetic and Enthusiastic (E/E), Happy and Content (H/C), Active and Comfortable (A/C), and Calm and Relaxed (C/R), generated information on HRQL in 4,217 dogs (3 months-21 years). Dogs were categorized by age; young, 3-47 months, middle-aged, 48-95 months, and old, 96 months and older. Owners considered 2,959 dogs (3-95 months) to be ""in perfect health"" and these were used to explore the relationship between age, sex, breed and HRQL in apparently healthy dogs. Mean score was significantly greater (better) in young compared to middle-aged dogs in E/E, H/C and A/C and declined with advancing age. In H/C there was a small but significant difference in mean score between female and male dogs (mean greater in females), with a similar rate of decline in each gender with advancing age. In E/E there were very small but statistically significant differences in mean scores between certain breeds. In A/C there was a statistically significant interaction between breed and age and the rate of decline with advancing age differed with breed. Overall, age, breed, and sex predicted very little of the variation seen in HRQL scores. Data from a subset of 152 dogs, for whom clinical information was available, were used to examine the agreement between clinical evidence and owner opinion. According to the clinical records, 89 dogs were healthy and 63 had evidence of chronic disease. There was an approximately 40% disagreement between owner opinion on health status and clinical evidence of chronic disease (35% disagreement in all dogs and 43% in old dogs). HRQL scores were generally higher in dogs for whom there was no evidence of disease in the clinical record.","Rodger, Susan; Scott, E Marian; Nolan, Andrea; Wright, Andrea K; Reid, Jacqueline",Frontiers in veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2021.603139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614760/,34

148663,A Phone Call Away: New York's Hotline And Public Health In The Rapidly Changing COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-06-11,"BACKGROUND The current study was designed to determine the relation between preoperative cerebral oxygen saturation (Sco2), variables of cardiopulmonary function, mortality, and morbidity in a heterogeneous cohort of cardiac surgery patients. METHODS In this study, 1,178 consecutive patients scheduled for on-pump surgery were prospectively studied. Preoperative Sco2, demographics, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitive troponin T, clinical outcomes, and 30-day and 1-yr mortality were recorded. RESULTS Median additive EuroSCORE was 5 (range: 0-19). Thirty-day and 1-yr mortality and major morbidity (at least two major complications and/or a high-dependency unit stay of at least 10 days) were 3.5%, 7.7%, and 13.3%, respectively. Median minimal preoperative oxygen supplemented Sco2 (Sco2min-ox) was 64% (range: 15-92%). Sco2min-ox was correlated (all: P value <0.0001) with N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (ρ: -0.35), high-sensitive troponin T (ρ: -0.28), hematocrit (ρ: 0.34), glomerular filtration rate (ρ: 0.19), EuroSCORE (τ: 0.20), and left ventricular ejection fraction class (τ: 0.12). Thirty-day nonsurvivors had a lower Sco2min-ox than survivors (median 58% [95% CI, 50.7-62%] vs. 64% [95% CI, 64-65%]; P < 0.0001). Receiver-operating curve analysis of Sco2min-ox and 30-day mortality revealed an area-under-the-curve of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.68-0.73%; P < 0.0001) in the total cohort and an area-under-the-curve of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.69-0.86%; P < 0.0001) in patients with a EuroSCORE more than 10. Logistic regression based on different EuroSCORE categories (0-2; 3-5, 6-10, >10), Sco2min-ox, and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass showed that a Sco2min-ox equal or less than 50% is an independent risk factor for 30-day and 1-yr mortality. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative Sco2 levels are reflective of the severity of cardiopulmonary dysfunction, associated with short- and long-term mortality and morbidity, and may add to preoperative risk stratification in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.","Heringlake, Matthias; Garbers, Christof; Käbler, Jan-Hendrik; Anderson, Ingrid; Heinze, Hermann; Schön, Julika; Berger, Klaus-Ulrich; Dibbelt, Leif; Sievers, Hans-Hinrich; Hanke, Thorsten",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0b013e3181fef34e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21178669/,34

METHODS Collaborating national death care organizations distributed the 47-question electronic survey. N = 424 surveys were initiated and results recorded. The survey collected death care sector-specific information pertaining to the comfortability and willingness to handle highly infectious remains; perceptions of readiness, current policies and procedures in place to address highly infectious diseases; current highly infectious disease training levels, available resources, and personal protective equipment. RESULTS One-third of respondents have been trained on how to manage highly infectious remains. There was a discrepancy between Supervisor/Management and Employee/Worker perceptions on employees' willingness and comfortability to manage potentially highly infectious remains. More than 40% of respondents did not know the correct routes of transmission for viral hemorrhagic fevers. CONCLUSIONS Results suggest death care workers could benefit from increasing up-to-date industry-specific training and education on highly infectious disease risk mitigation and management. Professional death care sector organizations are positioned to disseminate information, training, and best practices.","Le, Aurora B; Witter, Lesley; Herstein, Jocelyn J; Jelden, Katelyn C; Beam, Elizabeth L; Gibbs, Shawn G; Lowe, John J",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2017.1319570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28609169/,34

Learning objectives included developing stronger therapeutic relationships, addressing the effects of structural racism in the lives of patients, and mitigating racism in the medical encounter. METHOD The antiracism curriculum was delivered and evaluated in 2019 through focus groups and written input before and after each module. The process and outcome evaluation used a grounded theory approach. RESULTS Three emergent themes reflect how medical students experienced the antiracism curriculum and inform recommendations for integrating an antiracism curriculum into future medical education. The themes are: 1) the differential needs and experiences of persons of color and Whites, 2) the need to address issues of racism within medical education as well as in medical care, and 3) the need for structures of accountability in medical education. CONCLUSIONS Medical educators must address racism in medical education before seeking to direct students to address it in medical practice.","Ona, Fernando F; Amutah-Onukagha, Ndidiamaka N; Asemamaw, Rina; Schlaff, Anthony L",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33229958/,34

Cardiac arrhythmias have been reported as frequent but their incidence is unknown. The aim of this research was to assess the real incidence of cardiac arrhythmias among COVID-19 patients admitted to Portuguese hospitals and to understand the underlying prognostic implications. Methods The Portuguese Association of Arrhythmology, Pacing and Electrophysiology (APAPE) conducted a survey in Portuguese hospitals to assess the occurrence of arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients, their clinical characteristics, the use of experimental therapies and the impact on QT interval. Results Twenty hospitals participated, reporting 692 hospitalized patients. An arrhythmic episode occurred in 81 (11.7%) and 64 (79%) had detailed information on these episodes. New onset arrhythmias occurred in 41 (64%) patients, 45 (70.3%) male, median age 73.5 (61-80.3) years. There were 51 (79.7%) with associated comorbidities, mainly arterial hypertension (41, 64.1%). Of 53 patients (82.3%) on experimental therapy, 7 (10.9%) had an increased QTc interval. Regarding arrhythmias, two patients (3.1%) had ventricular tachycardia, 5 (7.8%) sinus bradycardia, 17 (26.6%) paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and 40 (62.5%) atrial fibrillation or flutter. At the time of reporting, there had been no deaths due to arrhythmic syndrome or related complications. Conclusions In a population of COVID-19 patients. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias is high but not associated with increased cardiac mortality although it does though occur frequently in extremely ill patients and with multiple organ failure. Regardless of the use of experimental drugs, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias is low and atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular arrhythmias are the most prevalent arrythmias.","Mesquita, Dinis; Carmo, Pedro; Cabanelas, Nuno; Santos, Nuno; Martins, Vítor; Sanfins, Victor; Costa, Helena Cristina; Fontes, José Paulo; Fonseca, Paulo; Parreira, Leonor",Revista portuguesa de cardiologia : orgao oficial da Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia = Portuguese journal of cardiology : an official journal of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.repc.2020.11.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34629726/,34

During pregnancy, the obstetric provider may be the first or only clinician approached with questions regarding travel. Objective In this review, we discuss the reasons women travel during pregnancy, medical considerations for long-haul air travel, destination-specific medical complications, and precautions for pregnant women to take both before travel and while abroad. To improve the quality of pretravel counseling for patients before or during pregnancy, we have created 2 tools: a guide for assessing the pregnant patient's risk during travel and a pretravel checklist for the obstetric provider. Evidence Acquisition A PubMed search for English-language publications about travel during pregnancy was performed using the search terms ""travel"" and ""pregnancy"" and was limited to those published since the year 2000. Studies on subtopics were not limited by year of publication. Results Eight review articles were identified. Three additional studies that analyzed data from travel clinics were found, and 2 studies reported on the frequency of international travel during pregnancy. Additional publications addressed air travel during pregnancy (10 reviews, 16 studies), high-altitude travel during pregnancy (5 reviews, 5 studies), and destination-specific illnesses in pregnant travelers. Conclusions and Relevance Travel during pregnancy including international travel is common. Pregnant travelers have unique travel-related and destination-specific risks. We review those risks and provide tools for obstetric providers to use in counseling pregnant travelers.","Antony, Kathleen M; Ehrenthal, Deborah; Evensen, Ann; Iruretagoyena, J Igor",Obstetrical & gynecological survey,https://doi.org/10.1097/ogx.0000000000000398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28218771/,34
160742,Moving Beyond Capitalism for Our Health.,2020-05-05,"INTRODUCTION Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) can have detrimental effects on quality of life, even among patients with non-central nervous system (CNS) cancers. Several studies have been conducted to explore different markers associated with CRCI to understand its pathobiology. It is proposed that the underlying mechanisms of CRCI are related to a cascade of physiological adaptive events in response to cancer and/or treatment. Hence, peripheral blood would be a logical source to observe and identify these physiological events. This paper outlines the protocol for a scoping review being conducted to summarise the extant literature regarding blood-based biomarkers of CRCI among patients with non-CNS cancer. METHODS/ANALYSIS Methods will be informed by the updated guidelines of Arksey and O'Malley. The systematic search for literature will include electronic databases, handsearching of key journals and reference lists, forward citation tracking and consultation with content experts. Study selection will be confirmed by duplicate review and calculation of inter-rater reliability. Data to be charted will include study design, sample size, cancer and treatment characteristics, demographic characteristics, cognitive variable/s and biomarkers assessed, associations between cognitive functioning and biomarkers (including statistics used), and rigour in biomarker sample collection and processing. Results will be presented through: (1) a descriptive numerical summary of studies, including a flow diagram based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement, (2) a list of blood-based biomarkers associated with CRCI and (3) a narrative overview developed through collaboration among the research team and consultation with content experts. DISSEMINATION The findings of this review will highlight current directions and gaps in the current body of evidence that may lead to improved rigour in future CRCI investigations. The dissemination of this work will be facilitated through the involvement of clinicians and researchers on the research team, an external consultation process and the presentation of the results through scholarly publication and presentation.","Mayo, Samantha J; Kuruvilla, John; Laister, Rob C; Ayala, Ana Patricia; Alm, Mark; Byker, Will; Kelly, Debra Lynch; Saligan, Leorey",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29374660/,34
161063,Addressing health and social care during and beyond COVID-19: the importance of implementation science.,2021-03-10,"OBJECTIVES This systematic review aimed to describe medication non-adherence among people living with multimorbidity according to the current literature, and synthesise predictors of non-adherence in this population. METHODS A systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses. PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO were searched for relevant articles published in English language between January 2009 and April 2019. Quantitative studies reporting medication non-adherence and/or predictors of non-adherence among people with two or more chronic conditions were included in the review. A meta-analysis was conducted with a subgroup of studies that used an inclusive definition of multimorbidity to recruit participants, rather than seeking people with specific conditions. Remaining studies reporting prevalence and predictors of non-adherence were narratively synthesised. RESULTS The database search produced 10 998 records and a further 75 were identified through other sources. Following full-text screening, 178 studies were included in the review. The range of reported non-adherence differed by measurement method, at 76.5% for self-report, 69.4% for pharmacy data, and 44.1% for electronic monitoring. A meta-analysis was conducted with eight studies (n=8949) that used an inclusive definition of multimorbidity to recruit participants. The pooled prevalence of non-adherence was 42.6% (95% CI: 34.0 - 51.3%, k=8, I 2=97%, p<0.01). The overall range of non-adherence was 7.0%-83.5%. Frequently reported correlates of non-adherence included previous non-adherence and treatment-related beliefs. CONCLUSIONS The review identified a heterogeneous literature in terms of conditions studied, and definitions and measures of non-adherence used. Results suggest that future attempts to improve adherence among people with multimorbidity should determine for which conditions individuals require most support. The variable levels of medication non-adherence highlight the need for more attention to be paid by healthcare providers to the impact of multimorbidity on chronic disease self-management.

METHODS ARDS was induced in 24 beagle dogs with oleic acid. They had mechanical ventilation support. They were randomized into four groups after the establishment of the ARDS model: non-SI-open group where no SI was applied in beagle dogs with ARDS following open endotracheal suctioning; non-SI-closed group where no SI was applied in beagle dogs with ARDS following closed endotracheal suctioning; SI-open group where SI was applied in beagle dogs with ARDS following open endotracheal suctioning; and SI-closed group where SI was applied in beagle dogs with ARDS following closed endotracheal suctioning. Oxygenation, indexes of respiratory mechanics, and hemodynamic indexes were serially measured during the procedure. The serum protein level, or the messenger RNA in the heart and lung, of inflammation-related cytokines was investigated. RESULTS SI in ARDS improved oxygenation, lung compliance, and airway resistance but had no significant effect in the hemodynamic indexes. At molecular level, SI in ARDS neutralized the increases of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1β [IL-1β], and IL-6), and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) in the serum. Furthermore, SI in ARDS increased aquaporin 1 and aquaporin 5 messenger RNA in the lung tissue, and decreased IL-6 messenger RNA in the lung and heart tissue. CONCLUSION SI in ARDS could improve oxygenation, lung compliance, and airway resistance, which was related to the improved degree of inflammation and better maintained aquaporins.","Zhao, Feng; Wang, Wei; Fang, Yong; Li, Xiantao; Shen, Lei; Cao, Tongwa; Zhu, Hechen",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/ta.0b013e318265cc6f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22976418/,34
162929,"Work readiness during covid-19 among taxibike online drivers in samarinda, indonesia",2021,"The first case of Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) was registered in Wuhan, China, in November 2019. In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The effects of this pandemic have been devastating worldwide, especially in Brazil, which occupies the third position in the absolute number of cases of COVID-19 and the second position in the absolute number of deaths by the virus. A big question that the population yearns to be answered is: When can life return to normal? To address this question, this work proposes an extension of a SIRD-based mathematical model that includes vaccination effects. The model takes into account different rates of daily vaccination and different values of vaccine effectiveness. The results show that although the discussion is very much around the effectiveness of the vaccine, the daily vaccination rate is the most important variable for mitigating the pandemic. Vaccination rates of 1M per day can potentially stop the progression of COVID-19 epidemics in Brazil in less than one year. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Oliveira, R. S.; Xavier, C.

However, they also raised numerous controversies because of their potential to endanger civil rights and privacy. Most studies on the acceptance of anti-COVID-19 tracking technologies did not include important social factors and did not examine the directionality between variables. We aimed to fill this gap in the present study. Methods We conducted a four-wave, representative longitudinal panel survey among Polish citizens on the relationship between acceptance of anti-COVID-19 tracking technologies and prosociality, national identification, and endorsement of individual liberty. Analyses were performed using random-intercept cross-lagged panel models. Results We observed bidirectional cross-lagged relationships between prosociality and acceptance of anti-COVID 19 tracking technologies, with a stronger path from prosociality to acceptance than the other way around. Endorsement of individual liberty predicted negative attitudes towards technologies and this relation was strengthened by perceived threat of future technological surveillance. We did not find a significant relationship between acceptance of technologies and national identification. Conclusions This is the first study to analyse dynamic within-person relationships between communal and individual aspects and acceptance of anti-COVID-19 surveillance technologies. We conclude that prosocial attitude may lead to social acceptance of technology that, while helpful to fight with pandemic, might also infringe on personal rights.","Wnuk, Anna Oleksy Tomasz Domaradzka Anna",Computers in Human Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2021.106938,34

The rapid spread of the Corona Virus or COVID-19 throughout the world has damaged the order of life starting from the economy, social, politics, education, culture, religion and health. Various efforts have been made by the Indonesian government with social distancing or physical distancing, washing hands with soap and staying active at home. Conditions that change suddenly will make people unprepared to deal with it, especially in the psychological condition of the Indonesian people who experience a lot of anxiety. AIM: The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of mindfulness meditation based on spiritual care on the level of community anxiety due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This type of research uses experimental quantitative research using a randomized controlled trial research design. This research was conducted for 4 weeks in January-February 2021. The population of this study is the Surabaya community. The sampling technique used consecutive sampling technique and was divided into two groups, namely the intervention group as many as 61 respondents and the control group as many as 61 respondents. Data analysis used paired t test and independent t test with a significance value of p < 0.05. This research questionnaire uses the DASS 42 questionnaire has reliability 0.82 and the validity test gets the Cronbach alpha value is 0.85. RESULTS: The average level of anxiety before doing the spiritual care-based mindfulness meditation intervention in the intervention group was 17.28 (severe anxiety) and 17.18 in the control group (severe anxiety) with p = 1.000 which means there is no difference in the average level of anxiety whereas After being given the intervention, the average level of anxiety in the intervention group was 6.03 (normal anxiety) and 18.06 in the control group (severe anxiety) with p = 0.000, which means that there is a difference in the average level of anxiety in the intervention group and the control group after being given the intervention. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness meditation based on spiritual care can reduce people’s anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Siti Nur Hasina, Iis Noventi, P. H.

This cross-correlation has not yet been considered in the literature, and it permits a direct theoretical modelling of the main astrophysical components. We describe the expected form of the cross-correlation and show how, if the distribution of UHECR sources trace the large-scale cosmic structure, it could be easier to detect with current data than the UHECR auto-correlation. Moreover, the cross-correlation is more sensitive to UHECR anisotropies on smaller angular scales, more robust to systematic uncertainties, and it could be used to determine the redshift distribution of UHECR sources, making it a valuable tool in determining their origins and properties.","Urban, Federico R.; Camera, Stefano; Alonso, David",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00244v2.pdf,34

A notable feature of these models is the redistribution of credit risk towards shorter maturity: this constitutes an interesting improvement to diffusion models, which are known to underestimate short term default probabilities. We also provide extensions to a model featuring both positive and negative jumps and discuss qualitative and quantitative features of the results. For readers convenience, practical tools for model implementation and GitHub links are also included.","Aguilar, Jean-Philippe; Pesci, Nicolas; James, Victor",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06299v3.pdf,34

Since it is still mainly women who provide childcare, a discussion about re-traditionalization has emerged in the context of the Corona crisis. Up to now, there are hardly any empirical findings on gender effects of the Corona pandemic on participation in further education. We make a contribution to this political, societal as well as economical relevant topic by analyzing participation, learning efforts, and completion rates in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) during the Corona pandemic with a focus on gender aspects. Based on micro theoretical approaches as well as hypotheses of social and economic influences on participation in continuing education, we quantitatively examine the access as well as participants' engagement and success to more than ten MOOCs in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) offered during the Corona-related restrictions in 2020 and one year before by gender. Based on descriptive statistics, we register increasing course enrollments, but a decreasing share of female learners since the Corona-related restrictions. Nevertheless, we Figure out that both participating men as well as women access more digital learning materials and reach higher completion rates than before the Corona crisis. Our multivariate linear probability models indicate further influences of socio-economic variables, such as career status. With regard to the current state of research, we discuss our findings, draw conclusions, formulate implications, and give an outlook on our future research. © 2021 IEEE.","John, C.; Meinel, C.","2021 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/educon46332.2021.9453868,34

This data is used as a baseline to model the Fall 2020 semester with the college's COVID-19 mitigation strategies: cancel or virtualize some groups, split the semester into two independent sessions, and separate larger courses into hybrid meetings. Network analysis shows that students and faculty had at most 4 degrees of separation in Fall 2019, student organizations can have a large impact on campus connectedness, all semester modifications implemented in Fall 2020 can reduce connectedness, and the largest reduction was seen by splitting the semester into two sessions.","Givens, R.

Booster vaccinations have recently received emergency use authorization (EUA) for certain populations but are restricted to homologous mRNA vaccines. We evaluated homologous and heterologous booster vaccination in persons who had received an EUA Covid-19 vaccine regimen. Methods: In this phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial conducted at ten U.S. sites, adults who received one of three EUA Covid-19 vaccines at least 12 weeks prior to enrollment and had no reported history of SARS-CoV-2 infection received a booster injection with one of three vaccines (Moderna mRNA-1273 100-mcg, Janssen Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 virus particles, or Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 30-mcg; nine combinations). The primary outcomes were safety, reactogenicity, and humoral immunogenicity on study days 15 and 29. Results: 458 individuals were enrolled: 154 received mRNA-1273, 150 received Ad26.CoV2.S, and 154 received BNT162b2 booster vaccines. Reactogenicity was similar to that reported for the primary series. Injection site pain, malaise, headache, and myalgia occurred in more than half the participants. Booster vaccines increased the neutralizing activity against a D614G pseudovirus (4.2-76-fold) and binding antibody titers (4.6-56-fold) for all combinations; homologous boost increased neutralizing antibody titers 4.2-20-fold whereas heterologous boost increased titers 6.2-76-fold. Day 15 neutralizing and binding antibody titers varied by 28.7-fold and 20.9-fold, respectively, across the nine prime-boost combinations. Conclusion: Homologous and heterologous booster vaccinations were well-tolerated and immunogenic in adults who completed a primary Covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier.","Atmar, R.

Our findings suggest that students' satisfaction with online learning was positively related to the interactions between students and instructor, teaching presence, self-management of learning, and academic self-efficacy. We also found that student satisfaction with online learning positively predicted their intention to continue to use online learning. Thus, our findings in this study provide educators with ways to increase student satisfaction, and add to knowledge about the relationship between students' satisfaction and their intention to take online courses.","Um, Nam-Hyun Jang Ahnlee",Social Behavior and Personality,https://doi.org/10.2224/sbp.10397,34

The potential of a live oral vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), however, remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the immunogenicity of live SARS-CoV-2 delivered to the gastrointestinal tract in rhesus macaques and its protective efficacy against intranasal and intratracheal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Post-pyloric administration of SARS-CoV-2 by esophagogastroduodenoscopy resulted in limited virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract and minimal to no induction of mucosal antibody titers in rectal swabs, nasal swabs, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Low levels of serum neutralizing antibodies were induced and correlated with modestly diminished viral loads in nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage following intranasal and intratracheal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Overall, our data show that post-pyloric inoculation of live SARS-CoV-2 is weakly immunogenic and confers partial protection against respiratory SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques. Importance SARS-CoV-2 remains a global threat, despite the rapid deployment but limited coverage of multiple vaccines. Alternative vaccine strategies that have favorable manufacturing timelines, greater ease of distribution and improved coverage may offer significant public health benefits, especially in resource-limited settings. Live oral vaccines have the potential to address some of these limitations; however no studies have yet been conducted to assess the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a live oral vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Here we report that oral administration of live SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates may offer prophylactic benefits, but that formulation and route of administration will require further optimization.","Yu, Jingyou; Collins, Natalie D.; Mercado, Noe B.; McMahan, Katherine; Chandrashekar, Abishek; Liu, Jinyan; Anioke, Tochi; Chang, Aiquan; Giffin, Victoria M.; Hope, David L.; Sellers, Daniel; Nampanya, Felix; Gardner, Sarah; Barrett, Julia; Wan, Huahua; Velasco, Jason; Teow, Elyse; Cook, Anthony; Van Ry, Alex; Pessaint, Laurent; Andersen, Hanne; Lewis, Mark G.; Hofer, Christian; Burke, Donald S.; Barkei, Erica K.; King, Hannah A.D.; Subra, Caroline; Bolton, Diane; Modjarrad, Kayvon; Michael, Nelson L.; Barouch, Dan H.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.13.460191,34

A questionnaire was sent to the 300 largest companies in Iceland, where environmental uncertainty has been prevalent.FindingsThe results indicate that increased uncertainty leads to a larger variety of non-financial performance measures, such as customer measures. A positive relationship is found between management satisfaction with the performance measurement system and firm performance. However, the variety of performance measures was not linked to management satisfaction or firm performance.Research limitations/implicationsThe results suggest that managers increase the variety of performance measures when uncertainty increases. However, it is not the variety itself that increases management satisfaction or improves firm performance.Practical implicationsPerformance measurement design is affected by environmental uncertainty. Managers focus on important stakeholder groups such as customers under such conditions and can consult research and practice for the purpose of customer relationship management and customer profitability measurement to improve measurement selection.Originality/valueThis work focusses on performance measurement system design, examining the use of more than 50 different performance measures, and differentiates between small and medium-sized firms and between service and non-service firms.","Rikhardsson, Pall Wendt Stefan Auður Arna Arnardóttir Throstur Olaf Sigurjónsson",International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijppm-11-2019-0539,34

We assessed the impact of this lockdown on New Zealand's public ophthalmology service. METHOD An anonymous online survey was sent to all New Zealand-based fellows of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO) after lockdown. Respondents provided retrospective assessment of practice patterns and their personal health during the COVID-19 lockdown. This was supported by national-level administrative data, allowing survey findings to be contextualised. RESULTS Fifty-seven respondents (response rate 49%) working in the public health system participated. A large majority of respondents reduced elective clinic and surgical volumes by at least 75% (82% and 98%, respectively). National-level information confirmed clinic reduced to 38.2% of normal and elective operating volumes to 11.5%, with virtual visits increasing 17.9-fold. Elective clinic and elective operating volumes promptly recovered to usual volumes on the second month post lockdown. Most respondents (58%) followed the RANZCO triaging guideline, and 28% triaged emergencies only. At a personal level, respondents reported a significant physical health benefit (p<0.001) associated with the lockdown experience, but no change in mental health or social wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS Publicly employed ophthalmologists experienced dramatic reductions to elective clinic and operating volumes during the COVID-19 lockdown. The prompt recovery of service delivery volumes back to pre-lockdown levels supports the value of a COVID-19 elimination strategy in New Zealand. Virtual visits for selected patients allowed ongoing management without risking virus transmission.","Scott, Daniel A R; Hadden, Peter W; Wilson, Graham A",The New Zealand medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34239151/,34

One favored mechanism to explain the role of viruses in the genesis of autoimmunity is molecular mimicry. An immunoinflammatory blinding lesion called herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) that follows ocular infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) is suggested to result from a CD4(+) T-cell response to a UL6 peptide of HSV that cross-reacts with a corneal autopeptide shared with the immunoglobulin G2a(b) (IgG2a(b)) isotype. The present report reevaluates the molecular mimicry hypothesis to explain HSK pathogenesis. Our results failed to reveal cross-reactivity between the UL6 and IgG2a(b) peptides or between peptide reactive T cells and HSV antigens. More importantly, animals infected with HSV failed to develop responses that reacted with either peptide, and infection with a recombinant vaccinia UL6 vector failed to cause HSK, in spite of generating UL6 reactivity. Other lines of evidence also failed to support the molecular mimicry hypothesis, such as the failure to affect HSK severity upon tolerization of susceptible BALB/c and B-cell-deficient mice with IgG2a(b) or UL6 peptides. An additional study system revealed that HSK could be induced in mouse strains, such as the OT2 x RAG1(-/-) mice (T cell receptor transgenic recognizing OVA(323-339)) that were unable to produce CD4(+) T-cell responses to any detectable HSV antigens. Our results cast doubt on the molecular mimicry hypothesis as an explanation for the pathogenesis of HSK and indicate that if autoimmunity is involved its likely proceeds via a bystander activation mechanism.","Deshpande, S P; Lee, S; Zheng, M; Song, B; Knipe, D; Kapp, J A; Rouse, B T",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11238834/,34

ANIMALS 229 lactating and nonlactating adult cattle (125 case and 104 control cattle) selected from 12 dairy herds. PROCEDURE A case-control study, using multivariate conditional logistic regression and controlling for herd effects, was used to develop a model for risk factors associated with disease for each cow. RESULTS Likelihood of developing disease increased as the ELISA value for bovine coronavirus (BCV) antigen detectable in feces increased (odds ratio [OR] = 2.94 for each 0.100 increase in BCV antigen ELISA value). Pregnant cattle were less likely to develop WD, compared with nonpregnant herdmates. Cows with high acute BCV antibody titers that seroresponded had greater odds of developing disease, compared with seroresponding cows with low acute titers. However, among those cows that did not serorespond, high acute antibody titers were associated with lower odds of developing the disease. CONCLUSION In herds affected by WD, ill cows were more likely to shed detectable amounts of BCV antigen in their feces, and pregnancy appeared to protect cattle from the disease. The measured interaction between BCV seroresponse and acute BCV antibody titer may be evidence of an immunopathologic condition, but could also have been attributable to dynamics of the ELISA or study design. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Factors that explained a cow's risk for illness within WD-affected herds may have been surrogate measures for that cow's nonspecific and BCV-specific immune profile.","Smith, D R; Fedorka-Cray, P J; Mohan, R; Brock, K V; Wittum, T E; Morley, P S; Hoblet, K H; Saif, L J",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9706202/,34

Virus was isolated from the nasal secretion of one sow as early as 20 hours after contact exposure to the infected piglets. At necropsy, the virus was more frequently isolated from the tissues of the upper respiratory tract than from small intestines; this finding indicated that the TGE coronavirus replicated in the upper respiratory tract and induced an acute respiratory infection in susceptible adult swine. Neutralizing antibody was present in the sera 8 sows after 12 to 36 days during the convalescent period.

We have previously shown that this changed the tropism of the virus in vitro (R. Casais, B. Dove, D. Cavanagh, and P. Britton, J. Virol. 77:9084-9089, 2003). Herein we have assessed the pathogenicity and immunogenicity of BeauR-M41(S). There were no consistent differences in pathogenicity between the recombinant BeauR-M41(S) and its apathogenic parent Beau-R (based on snicking, nasal discharge, wheezing, watery eyes, rales, and ciliostasis in trachea), and both replicated poorly in trachea and nose compared to M41; the S protein from the pathogenic M41 had not altered the apathogenic nature of Beau-R. Both Beau-R and BeauR-M41(S) induced protection against challenge with M41 as assessed by absence of recovery of challenge virus and nasal exudate. With regard to snicking and ciliostasis, BeauR-M41(S) induced greater protection (seven out of nine chicks [77%]; assessed by ciliostasis) than Beau-R (one out of nine; 11%) but less than M41 (100%). The greater protection induced by BeauR-M41(S) against M41 may be related to the ectodomain of the spike protein of Beau-R differing from that of M41 by 4.1%; a small number of epitopes on the S protein may play a disproportionate role in the induction of immunity. The results are promising for the prospects of S-gene exchange for IBV vaccine development.","Hodgson, Teri; Casais, Rosa; Dove, Brian; Britton, Paul; Cavanagh, Dave",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15564488/,34

The mouse genome contains two very similar Bgp genes, Bgp1 and Bgp2, whereas the human and rat genomes contain only one BGP gene. A Bgp2 isoform was previously identified as an alternative receptor for the mouse coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus. This isoform consists of two extracellular immunoglobulin domains, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail of five amino acids. In this report, we have examined whether the Bgp2 gene can express other isoforms in different mouse tissues. We found only one other isoform, which has a long cytoplasmic tail of 73 amino acids. The long cytodomain of the Bgp2 protein is highly similar to that of the Bgp1/4L isoform. The Bgp2 protein is expressed in low amounts in kidney and in a rectal carcinoma cell line. Antibodies specific to Bgp2 detected a 42-kDa protein, which is expressed at the cell surface of these samples. Bgp2 was found by immunocytochemistry in smooth muscle layers of the kidney, the uterus, in gut mononuclear cells and in the crypt epithelia of intestinal tissues. Transfection studies showed that, in contrast with Bgp1, the Bgp2 glycoprotein was not directly involved in intercellular adhesion. However, this protein is found in the proliferative compartment of the intestinal crypts and in cells involved in immune recognition. This suggests that the Bgp2 protein represents a distinctive member of the CEA family; its unusual expression patterns in mouse tissues and the unique functions it may be fulfilling may provide novel clues about the multiple functions mediated by a common BGP protein in humans and rats.","Robitaille, J; Izzi, L; Daniels, E; Zelus, B; Holmes, K V; Beauchemin, N",European journal of biochemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10491101/,34

201916,"Kenyan school book knowledge for water, sanitation, hygiene and health education interventions: Disconnect, integration or opportunities?",2021,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is defined as threatened, attempted, or completed physical or sexual violence or emotional abuse by a current or former intimate partner. IPV can be committed by a spouse, an ex-spouse, a current or former boyfriend or girlfriend, or a dating partner. Each year, IPV results in an estimated 1,200 deaths and 2 million injuries among women and nearly 600,000 injuries among men. In addition to the risk for death and injury, IPV has been associated with certain adverse health conditions and health risk behaviors. To gather additional information regarding the prevalence of IPV and to assess the association between IPV and selected adverse health conditions and health risk behaviors, CDC included IPV-related questions in an optional module of the 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. This report describes the results of that survey, which indicated that persons who report having experienced IPV during their lifetimes also are more likely to report current adverse health conditions and health risk behaviors. Although a causal link between IPV and adverse health conditions cannot be inferred from these results, they underscore the need for IPV assessment in health-care settings. In addition, the results indicate a need for secondary intervention strategies to address the health-related needs of IPV victims and reduce their risk for subsequent adverse health conditions and health risk behaviors.",,MMWR.

METHODS: Complete postmortem examinations were performed according to standard procedures in a negative-pressure autopsy suite/isolation room using personal protective equipment, including N95 masks, eye protection, and gowns. The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing on postmortem swabs. RESULTS: A 77-year-old obese man with a history of hypertension, splenectomy, and 6 days of fever and chills died while being transported for medical care. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on postmortem nasopharyngeal and lung parenchymal swabs. Autopsy revealed diffuse alveolar damage and chronic inflammation and edema in the bronchial mucosa. A 42-year-old obese man with a history of myotonic dystrophy developed abdominal pain followed by fever, shortness of breath, and cough. Postmortem nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2; lung parenchymal swabs were negative. Autopsy showed acute bronchopneumonia with evidence of aspiration. Neither autopsy revealed viral inclusions, mucus plugging in airways, eosinophils, or myocarditis. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 testing can be performed at autopsy. Autopsy findings such as diffuse alveolar damage and airway inflammation reflect true virus-related pathology; other findings represent superimposed or unrelated processes.","Barton, Lisa M; Duval, Eric J; Stroberg, Edana; Ghosh, Subha; Mukhopadhyay, Sanjay",Am J Clin Pathol,,34

The Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock (J-SSCG) 2020 Special Committee created the Japanese Rapid/Living recommendations on drug management for COVID-19 using the experience of creating the J-SSCGs. The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to determine the certainty of the evidence and strength of the recommendations. The first edition of this guideline was released on September 9, 2020, and this document is the revised edition (ver. 3.1) (released on March 30, 2021). Clinical questions (CQs) were set for the following seven drugs: favipiravir (CQ1), remdesivir (CQ-2), hydroxychloroquine (CQ-3), corticosteroids (CQ-4), tocilizumab (CQ-5), ciclesonide (CQ-6), and anticoagulants (CQ-7). Favipiravir is recommended for patients with mild COVID-19 not requiring supplemental oxygen (GRADE 2C); remdesivir for moderate COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 2B); hydroxychloroquine is not recommended for all COVID-19 patients (GRADE 1B); corticosteroids are recommended for moderate COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 1B) and severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilator management/intensive care (GRADE 1A); however, their administration is not recommended for mild COVID-19 patients not requiring supplemental oxygen (GRADE 1B); tocilizumab is recommended for moderate COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 2B); and anticoagulant therapy for moderate COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization and severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilator management/intensive care (GRADE 2C).

METHODS: We focus on four key health care policy decisions made by the administration in response to the public health emergency: rejecting a special Marketplace enrollment period; failing to use its full powers to enhance state Medicaid emergency options; refusing to suspend the public charge rule; and failing to target provider relief funds to providers serving the uninsured. FINDINGS: In each case, the administration's policy choices intensified, rather than mitigated, structural racism and racial health inequality. Its choices had a disproportionate adverse impact on minority populations and patients who are more likely to depend on public programs, be poor, experience pandemic-related job loss, lack insurance, rely on health care safety net providers, and be exposed to public charge sanctions. CONCLUSIONS: Ending structural racism in health care and promoting racial health care equity demands an equity-mindful approach to the pursuit of policies that enhance-rather than undermine-health care accessibility and effectiveness and resources for the poorest communities and the providers that serve them.","Rosenbaum, Sara; Handley, Morgan; Morris, Rebecca; Casoni, Maria",J. health polit. policy law,,34

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on all patients referred through the 2WWCP between October 2018 and September 2019. The referrals were audited against the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) NG12/DG30 guidelines for referral to the 2WWCP, and against the Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) 2017 guidelines for CTC. RESULTS: Over the study period, there were 1,707 2WWCP referrals, and 362 (21.2%) of these patients underwent CTC. The median age was 66 years, and 55% were female. Forty-six patients did not meet the NICE NG12/DG30 guidelines for referral to the 2WWCP, and a further 268, although meeting the NICE guidelines, did not meet the RCR 2017 guidelines for CTC. In total, only 13% of CTCs performed complied with both guidelines. CONCLUSION: This audit demonstrated a significant opportunity to reallocate CTC resources in the recovery stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. To improve outcomes for colorectal cancer (CRC) in the UK, establishing a selective straight-to-test CTC 2WWCP should be considered. Documented consent detailing the risks and benefits of CTC versus colonoscopy should take place in order to assist the patient in making an informed choice.","O039,; Donohoe, N; Jamal, S; Cope, J; Strom, L; Ryan, S; Nunoo-Mensah, J W",Clin. radiol,,34
212134,Spiritual Well-Being and Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy,2021,"Nanopore genome sequencing is the key to enabling personalized medicine, global food security, and virus surveillance. The state-of-the-art base-callers adopt deep neural networks (DNNs) to translate electrical signals generated by nanopore sequencers to digital DNA symbols. A DNN-based base-caller consumes $44.5\%$ of total execution time of a nanopore sequencing pipeline. However, it is difficult to quantize a base-caller and build a power-efficient processing-in-memory (PIM) to run the quantized base-caller. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm/architecture co-designed PIM, Helix, to power-efficiently and accurately accelerate nanopore base-calling. From algorithm perspective, we present systematic error aware training to minimize the number of systematic errors in a quantized base-caller. From architecture perspective, we propose a low-power SOT-MRAM-based ADC array to process analog-to-digital conversion operations and improve power efficiency of prior DNN PIMs. Moreover, we revised a traditional NVM-based dot-product engine to accelerate CTC decoding operations, and create a SOT-MRAM binary comparator array to process read voting. Compared to state-of-the-art PIMs, Helix improves base-calling throughput by $6\times$, throughput per Watt by $11.9\times$ and per $mm^2$ by $7.5\times$ without degrading base-calling accuracy.","Lou, Qian; Janga, Sarath; Jiang, Lei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03107v1.pdf,34
213878,Commonsense Questions to Move Beyond Health Care at All Costs,2020,"With increasing age, the immune system undergoes a remodeling process, affecting the shift of T cell subpopulations and the development of chronic low-grade inflammation. Clinically, this is characterized by increased susceptibility to infections or development of several diseases. Since lifestyle factors can play a significant role in reducing the hallmarks of immune aging and inflammation, we investigated the effect of a 6 week low-dose combined resistance and endurance training program. Forty participants (70.3 ± 5.0 years) were randomly assigned to either a training (TG) or control group (CG) and performed a controlled low-threshold and care-oriented 6-week-long combined resistance and endurance training program. Changes in anthropometrics as well as strength capacity were measured. In subgroups of TG and CG, T cells and their subpopulations (CD4+, CD8+, naïve, central, effector memory, T-EMRA) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The changes of various plasma cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and adipokines were analyzed by luminex assays. The exercise program was followed by an increase in strength capacities. Participants of TG showed an increase of the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio over time (p < 0.05). Significant decreases in systemic levels of interleukin (IL-) 6, IL-8, IL-10 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (p < 0.05) were observed for participants of TG over time. Even short-term and low-threshold training can reduce some of the hallmarks of immune aging in elderly and thus could be beneficial to stimulate immunity. The specific characteristics of the program make it easily accessible to older people, who may benefit in the longer term in terms of their immunocompetence.","Despeghel, Michael; Reichel, Thomas; Zander, Johannes; Krüger, Karsten; Weyh, Christopher",,,34

Prior evidence suggests that, when people perceive uncontrollable risks to their health, they are less likely to engage in healthful behaviour. This article aims to understand the extent to which COVID-19 is perceived as an uncontrollable risk, and to assess whether this perceived risk is associated with health behaviour. Subject and methods: We surveyed a nationally representative sample of 496 participants during the first UK lockdown. We assessed perceptions of COVID-19-related risk, self-reported adherence to infection control measures recommended by the UK Government, and general health behaviours. We predicted that increased perceived extrinsic mortality risk (the portion of mortality risk perceived to be uncontrollable) would disincentivise healthy behaviour. Results: Perceived threat to life was the most consistent predictor of reported adherence to infection control measures. Perceived extrinsic mortality risk was found to have increased due to the pandemic, and was associated with lower reported adherence to Government advice on diet, physical activity, and smoking. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that health messages that highlight threat to life may be effective in increasing adherence to infection control, but may also lead to a reduction in health-promoting behaviours. We suggest that messages that highlight threat to life should be accompanied by statements of efficacy. Further, messages evoking feelings of concern for others may be effective in promoting compliance with anti-infection measures, without the potential for the unwelcome side-effect of discouraging healthy behaviour.

In this work, we link directly, through machine learning techniques, infection data at a country level to a single number that signifies social distancing effectiveness. We assume that the standard SIR model gives a reasonable description of the dynamics of spreading, and thus the social distancing aspect can be modeled through time-dependent infection rates that are imposed externally. We use an exponential ansatz to analyze the SIR model, find an exact solution for the time-independent infection rate, and derive a simple first-order differential equation for the time-dependent infection rate as a function of the infected population. Using infected number data from the""first wave""of the infection from eight countries, and through physics-informed machine learning, we extract the degree of linear dependence in social distancing that led to the specific infections. We find that in the two extremes are Greece, with the highest decay slope on one side, and the US on the other with a practically flat""decay"". The hierarchy of slopes is compatible with the effectiveness of the pandemic containment in each country.

This study applies molecular docking techniques to assess inhibitory effects of some bioactive compounds from the plants mentioned above against the main protease (Mpro), a key protein involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profiles for screened compounds were predicted in silico. Methods: The crystal structure of Mpro was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank, while the plant bioactive compounds were retrieved from Pubchem. Drug-likeness of the selected compounds and a control drug (hydroxychloroquine) were assessed, and the compounds that satisfied the drug-likeness rule were docked against Mpro. The docked complexes were analyzed using LigPlot and the protein-ligand profiler server. The top five compound hits were subjected to ADMET screening using the ADMETSar server. Results: A total of 17 out of 22 screened compounds passed Lipinski's assessment. Additionally, the most active compounds from the investigated plants exhibited relative inhibitory potentials against Mpro compared with hydroxychloroquine, which alludes to their possible involvement in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease replication process. Conclusions: In our study, most of the active phytocomponents of the investigated plants exhibited relative inhibitory potentials against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 and preferred pharmacological features when compared with hydroxychloroquine. These findings indicate these compounds are potentially antiviral candidates against SARS-CoV-2.","Umar, Haruna I; Josiah, Sunday S; Saliu, Tolulope P; Jimoh, Tajudeen O; Ajayi, Adeola; Danjuma, Jamilu B",,,34

METHODS: IR procedural volumes were compiled, stratified by location and compared with Diagnostic Radiology (DR) volumes during the same timeframe. Procedure volume was categorized by type, including oncology, dialysis interventions, and drainage procedures with comparisons made using Z-score test for proportions. IR and system-wide surgical procedural volume was compared with baseline values. RESULTS: System-wide IR procedural volume decreased by 35%, with a 41% decrease in outpatient and a 25% decrease in inpatient volume during the state-mandated order. DR volume decreased by 45%, with a 57% decrease in outpatient and a 22% decrease in inpatient volume. Total IR procedural volume during the mandate was 1077 versus 1518 during the preceding six weeks. The proportion of Interventional Oncology and dialysis interventions showed no significant change (p > 0.05) while that of drainage procedures increased (p < 0.05). Compared to baseline values, system-wide procedural volumes for IR, Vascular Surgery, Urology, General Surgery, Gastroenterology and Gynecology decreased by 3%, 11%, 25%, 20%, 38% and 31% in March 2020 and 25%, 47%, 68%, 63%, 79% and 73% in April 2020 respectively. CONCLUSION: Outpatient IR volumes were less impacted compared to DR during the initial phase of COVID-19. Oncology, dialysis and drainage interventions may be considered essential procedures due to their stability.

This study aims to characterize key attributes of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology as the infection emerged in China. An age-stratified mathematical model was constructed to describe transmission dynamics and estimate age-specific differences in biological susceptibility to infection, age-assortativeness in transmission mixing, and transition in rate of infectious contacts (and reproduction number R 0) following introduction of mass interventions. The model estimated the infectious contact rate in early epidemic at 0.59 contacts/day (95% uncertainty interval-UI = 0.48-0.71). Relative to those 60-69 years, susceptibility was 0.06 in those &#8804;19 years, 0.34 in 20-29 years, 0.57 in 30-39 years, 0.69 in 40-49 years, 0.79 in 50-59 years, 0.94 in 70-79 years, and 0.88 in &#8805;80 years. Assortativeness in transmission mixing by age was limited at 0.004 (95% UI = 0.002-0.008). R 0 rapidly declined from 2.1 (95% UI = 1.8-2.4) to 0.06 (95% UI = 0.05-0.07) following interventions' onset. Age appears to be a principal factor in explaining the transmission patterns in China. The biological susceptibility to infection seems limited among children but high among those >50 years. There was no evidence for differential contact mixing by age.","Ayoub, Houssein H; Chemaitelly, Hiam; Mumtaz, Ghina R; Seedat, Shaheen; Awad, Susanne F; Makhoul, Monia; Abu-Raddad, Laith J",Glob Epidemiol,,34

236469,Decreased CO2 Levels as Indicators of Possible Mechanical Ventilation-Induced Hyperventilation in COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Given the scale of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the development of vaccines based on different platforms is essential, particularly in light of emerging viral variants, the absence of information on vaccine-induced immune durability, and potential paediatric use. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an MF59-adjuvanted subunit vaccine for COVID-19 based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein stabilised in a pre-fusion conformation by a novel molecular clamp (spike glycoprotein-clamp [sclamp]). METHODS: We did a phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, block-randomised trial of the sclamp subunit vaccine in a single clinical trial site in Brisbane, QLD, Australia. Healthy adults (aged &#8805;18 to &#8804;55 years) who had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, reported no close contact with anyone with active or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and tested negative for pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity were included. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups and received two doses via intramuscular injection 28 days apart of either placebo, sclamp vaccine at 5 µg, 15 µg, or 45 µg, or one dose of sclamp vaccine at 45 µg followed by placebo. Participants and study personnel, except the dose administration personnel, were masked to treatment. The primary safety endpoints included solicited local and systemic adverse events in the 7 days after each dose and unsolicited adverse events up to 12 months after dosing. Here, data are reported up until day 57. Primary immunogenicity endpoints were antigen-specific IgG ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assays assessed at 28 days after each dose. The study is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04495933. FINDINGS: Between June 23, 2020, and Aug 17, 2020, of 314 healthy volunteers screened, 120 were randomly assigned (n=24 per group), and 114 (95%) completed the study up to day 57 (mean age 32·5 years [SD 10·4], 65 [54%] male, 55 [46%] female). Severe solicited reactions were infrequent and occurred at similar rates in participants receiving placebo (two [8%] of 24) and the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose (three [3%] of 96). Both solicited reactions and unsolicited adverse events occurred at a similar frequency in participants receiving placebo and the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine. Solicited reactions occurred in 19 (79%) of 24 participants receiving placebo and 86 (90%) of 96 receiving the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose. Unsolicited adverse events occurred in seven (29%) of 24 participants receiving placebo and 35 (36%) of 96 participants receiving the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose. Vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 sclamp elicited a similar antigen-specific response irrespective of dose: 4 weeks after the initial dose (day 29) with 5 µg dose (geometric mean titre [GMT] 6400, 95% CI 3683-11â122), with 15 µg dose (7492, 4959-11â319), and the two 45 µg dose cohorts (8770, 5526-13â920 in the two-dose 45 µg cohort; 8793, 5570-13â881 in the single-dose 45 µg cohort); 4 weeks after the second dose (day 57) with two 5 µg doses (102â400, 64â857-161â676), with two 15 µg doses (74â725, 51â300-108â847), with two 45 µg doses (79â586, 55â430-114â268), only a single 45 µg dose (4795, 2858-8043). At day 57, 67 (99%) of 68 participants who received two doses of sclamp vaccine at any concentration produced a neutralising immune response, compared with six (25%) of 24 who received a single 45 µg dose and none of 22 who received placebo. Participants receiving two doses of sclamp vaccine elicited similar neutralisation titres, irrespective of dose: two 5 µg doses (GMT 228, 95% CI 146-356), two 15 µg doses (230, 170-312), and two 45 µg doses (239, 187-307). INTERPRETATION: This first-in-human trial shows that a subunit vaccine comprising mammalian cell culture-derived, MF59-adjuvanted, molecular clamp-stabilised recombinant spike protein elicits strong immune responses with a promising safety profile. However, the glycoprotein 41 peptide present in the clamp created HIV diagnostic assay interference, a possible barrier to widespread use highlighting the criticality of potential non-spike directed immunogenicity during vaccine development. Studies are ongoing with alternative molecular clamp trimerisation domains to ameliorate this response.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 are increasingly reported, along with its potential relationship with overweight and/or obesity. Therefore, we aim here to review the current scientific literature on the impact of overweight and/or obesity among hospitalized patients who have developed severe or critical forms of COVID-19. Following PRISMA guidelines, our literature search identified over 300 scientific articles using the keywords ""obesity"" and ""COVID-19"", 22 of which were finally selected for reporting useful information on the association between overweight/obesity and disease severity. In particular, in 11 out of the 14 studies (79%) which evaluated the association between obesity and disease severity providing also a risk estimate (i.e., the odd ratio; OR), the OR value was constantly >2. Although the studies were found to be heterogeneous in terms of design, population, sample size and endpoints, in most cases a significant association was found between obesity and the risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 illness, intensive care unit admission and/or death. We can hence conclude that an increased body mass index shall be considered a negative prognostic factor in patients with COVID-19, and more aggressive prevention or treatment shall hence be reserved to overweight and/or obese patients.","Onorato, Diletta; Carpenè, Giovanni; Lippi, Giuseppe; Pucci, Mairi",Diagnosis (Berl),,34

The disease may continue to persist more extensively due to the increasing number of new cases daily, the rapid spread of the virus, and delay in the PCR analysis results. Therefore, it is necessary to consider developing assistive methods for detecting and diagnosing the COVID-19 to eradicate the spread of the novel coronavirus among people. Based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), automated detection systems have shown promising results of diagnosing patients with the COVID-19 through radiography; thus, they are introduced as a workable solution to the COVID-19 diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Based on the enhancement of the classical visual geometry group (VGG) network with the convolutional COVID block (CCBlock), an efficient screening model was proposed in this study to diagnose and distinguish patients with the COVID-19 from those with pneumonia and the healthy people through radiography. The model testing dataset included 1,828 x-ray images available on public platforms. 310 images were showing confirmed COVID-19 cases, 864 images indicating pneumonia cases, and 654 images showing healthy people. Results: According to the test results, enhancing the classical VGG network with radiography provided the highest diagnosis performance and overall accuracy of 98.52% for two classes as well as accuracy of 95.34% for three classes. Conclusions: According to the results, using the enhanced VGG deep neural network can help radiologists automatically diagnose the COVID-19 through radiography.","Al-Bawi, Ali; Al-Kaabi, Karrar Ali; Jeryo, Mohammed; Al-Fatlawi, Ahmad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10141v1.pdf,34

METHODS: A survey measured stress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms in Text4Hope subscribers using the Perceived Stress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 Part 3, respectively. A Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression were employed. RESULTS: Most respondents were 41-60 years old (49.5%), Caucasian (83.3%), with post-secondary education (92.1%), employed (70.3%), married/cohabiting/partnered (64.9%), and homeowners (71.7%). Likely PTSD was reported in 46.8% of the respondents. Those who were afraid to contract the coronavirus had a history of depression before the pandemic, and those who received counselling during the pandemic exhibited a high prevalence of likely PTSD (OR (1.7 to 2.2)). Significant lower odds of likely PTSD were observed among subscribers who received absolute support from family/friends. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents findings on the prevalence of likely PTSD and identified vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.

241382,Ten Epidemiological Parameters of COVID-19: Use of Rapid Literature Review to Inform Predictive Models During the Pandemic,2020,"Introduction. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only resulted in a public health crisis but has also strained hospital services. The provision of surgical care should therefore also be guided by ethical, and whenever applicable, also legal, principles. Methods. An integrative approach that covers clinical and ethical dimensions, as well as spans the spectrum of surgical care, is therefore necessary. This action research involved three key steps: 1) identification of ethical dilemmas related to the provision of surgical care during the COVID-19 pandemic;2) preparation of clinical scenarios that highlight these dilemmas;and 3) determination of the appropriate options for the said scenarios, based on the best available evidence as well as most applicable ethical principles. Results. Ethical theories included utilitarianism, human rights, and communitarianism. Ethical principles included non-maleficence, justice, autonomy, and beneficence. Values considered were duty, reciprocity, human life, efficiency, fairness, fidelity, ownership, social value, and fair innings. Also incorporated were informed consent, allocation principles, resource allocation, and triage. In terms of operational issues and surgical technical concerns, the following were considered: phased standards of care, categorization of interventions, prioritization, surgical approaches, infection control, diagnostics, patient welfare, staff welfare, operations protocols, surgical training, and communication. Key points derived from the ethical and technical considerations of surgical care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic are presented. Conclusion. This action research involving a review of the literature and stakeholder engagement has provided a concise ethical and technical resource for surgical administrators, practitioners, and trainees. © 2021 University of the Philippines Manila.

242843,Using Informational Murals and Handwashing Stations to Increase Access to Sanitation Among People Experiencing Homelessness During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus, is a major global human threat that has turned into a pandemic. This novel coronavirus has specifically high morbidity in the elderly and in comorbid populations. Uraemic patients on dialysis combine an intrinsic fragility and a very frequent burden of comorbidities with a specific setting in which many patients are repeatedly treated in the same area (haemodialysis centres). Moreover, if infected, the intensity of dialysis requiring specialized resources and staff is further complicated by requirements for isolation, control and prevention, putting healthcare systems under exceptional additional strain. Therefore, all measures to slow if not to eradicate the pandemic and to control unmanageably high incidence rates must be taken very seriously. The aim of the present review of the European Dialysis (EUDIAL) Working Group of ERA-EDTA is to provide recommendations for the prevention, mitigation and containment in haemodialysis centres of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The management of patients on dialysis affected by COVID-19 must be carried out according to strict protocols to minimize the risk for other patients and personnel taking care of these patients. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation and distribution have been shown to be efficient in similar settings. They are essential in the management of the pandemic and should be taken in the early stages of the disease.","Basile, Carlo; Combe, Christian; Pizzarelli, Francesco; Covic, Adrian; Davenport, Andrew; Kanbay, Mehmet; Kirmizis, Dimitrios; Schneditz, Daniel; van der Sande, Frank; Mitra, Sandip",Nephrol Dial Transplant,,34

Uraemic patients on dialysis combine an intrinsic fragility and a very frequent burden of comorbidities with a specific setting in which many patients are repeatedly treated in the same area (haemodialysis centres). Moreover, if infected, the intensity of dialysis requiring specialized resources and staff is further complicated by requirements for isolation, control and prevention, putting healthcare systems under exceptional additional strain. Therefore, all measures to slow if not to eradicate the pandemic and to control unmanageably high incidence rates must be taken very seriously. The aim of the present review of the European Dialysis (EUDIAL) Working Group of ERA-EDTA is to provide recommendations for the prevention, mitigation and containment in haemodialysis centres of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The management of patients on dialysis affected by COVID-19 must be carried out according to strict protocols to minimize the risk for other patients and personnel taking care of these patients. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation and distribution have been shown to be efficient in similar settings.

This study was conducted to assess the effect of reclassification of C3 glomerulopathies on renal outcomes, mortality, and response to therapy. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective analysis of 857 renal biopsies collected at The Canberra Hospital. Samples with predominant C3 staining were reviewed by a renal histopathologist. Of 31 biopsies with predominant C3 staining, 10 fulfilled histological criteria for C3 glomerulonephritis, while the remaining 21 cases were used as C3 Controls. RESULTS: Aside from a higher incidence of C3 glomerulonephritis in Torres Strait islanders (40% vs 5% C3 Controls, p = 0.04), presentation demographics were similar between the two groups. Median creatinine at diagnosis was higher in patients with C3 glomerulonephritis (253 umol/L IQR 103-333 vs 127 umol/L C3 Controls, IQR 105-182, p = 0.01). Prior to reclassification, a majority of C3 glomerulonephritis cases were diagnosed as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (60% vs 5% (C3 Controls) p < 0.01). Electron microscopy demonstrated all C3 glomerulonephritis patients had C3 deposition (100% vs 38% p = 0.02), these deposits were amorphous in nature (50% vs 5% respectively p = 0.007). C3 glomerulonephritis patients had shorter median follow-up (405 days IQR 203-1197 vs 1822 days respectively, IQR 1243-3948, p = 0.02). Mortality was higher in C3 glomerulonephritis patients (30% vs 14% in C3 Controls (log rank p = 0.02)). CONCLUSION: We have devised a diagnostic and treatment algorithm based on the results of literature review and our current study.

248514,Phases of psychological response in COVID-19: A preliminary heuristic,2021,"Prior research has recently shown that passively collected sensor data collected within the contexts of persons daily lives via smartphones and wearable sensors can distinguish those with major depressive disorder (MDD) from controls, predict MDD severity, and predict changes in MDD severity across days and weeks. Nevertheless, very little research has examined predicting depressed mood within a day, which is essential given the large amount of variation occurring within days. The current study utilized passively collected sensor data collected from a smartphone application to future depressed mood from hour-to-hour in an ecological momentary assessment study in a sample reporting clinical levels of depression (N = 31). Using a combination of nomothetic and idiographically-weighted machine learning models, the results suggest that depressed mood can be accurately predicted from hour to hour with an average correlation between out of sample predicted depressed mood levels and observed depressed mood of 0.587, CI [0.552, 0.621]. This suggests that passively collected smartphone data can accurately predict future depressed mood among a sample reporting clinical levels of depression. If replicated in other samples, this modeling framework may allow just-in-time adaptive interventions to treat depression as it changes in the context of daily life.","Jacobson, Nicholas C; Chung, Yeon Joo",,,34

The pattern of a metabolism-related signature in melanoma remains unknown. Here, we explored the role of a multi-metabolism-related gene signature in melanoma.We used the training and validation sets to develop a multi-metabolism-related gene signature. Cox regression analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method were used for constructing a model. The predictive role of the metabolic signature with clinicopathological features of melanoma was also analyzed. Functional analysis of this metabolic signature was also investigated.A ten metabolism-related gene signature was identified and can stratify melanoma into high- and low- risk groups. The signature was correlated with progressive T stage, Breslow thickness, Clark level, and worse survival (all Ps< 0.01). This metabolic signature was shown as an independent prognostic factor and was also a predictive indicator for worse survival in various clinical and molecular features of melanoma. Furthermore, the metabolic signature was implicated in immune responses such as the regulation of T cell activation and cytokine activity. The metabolic signaturewas associated with the progression and worse survival of melanoma. Our study offered a valuable metabolism-targeted therapy approach for melanoma.","Wan, Mengdi; Zhuang, Binyu; Dai, Xiao; Zhang, Liang; Zhao, Fangqing; You, Yan",Bioengineered,,34

Public measurements rely on an accurate diagnosis of individuals infected with the virus by using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The aim of our study is to relate the fundamental clinical and analytical performance of SARS-CoV-2 (RT-PCR) commercial kits. A total of 94 clinical samples were selected. Generally, 400 µl of each respiratory specimen was subjected to extraction using ExiPrep 96 Viral RNA Kit. All kits master mix preparation, cycling protocol, thermocycler, and results interpretation were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions of use and recommendations. The performance of the kits was comparable except for the LYRA kit as it was less sensitive (F = 67, p < .001). Overall, four kits scored a sensitivity of 100% including: BGI, IQ Real, Sansure, and RADI. For specificity, all the tested kits scored above 95%. The performance of these commercial kits by gene target showed no significant change in CT values which indicates that kits disparities are mainly linked to the oligonucleotide of the gene target. We believe that most of the commercially available RT-PCR kits included in this study can be used for routine diagnosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2. We recommend including kits with multiple targets in order to monitor the virus changes over time.","Altamimi, Asmaa M; Obeid, Dalia A; Alaifan, Taghreed A; Taha, Moroje T; Alhothali, Marwa T; Alzahrani, Fahad A; Albarrag, Ahmad M",J Med Virol,,34

METHODS: All subjects presenting at the major hospital of Milan from May-11 to July-5, 2020, underwent a serological screening by chemiluminescent assays. Those admitted were further tested by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The cumulative anti-N IgG seroprevalence in the 2753 subjects analyzed was of 5.1% (95%CI = 4.3%-6.0%), with a peak of 8.4% (6.1%-11.4%) 60-63 days since the peak of diagnoses (March-20). 31/106 (29.2%) anti-N reactive subjects had anti-S1/S2 titers >80 AU/mL.

However, this term can have unintended but detrimental effects, as it evokes negative feelings of being ignored, unwelcome, left alone with one's own fears, and even excluded from society. These feelings may be stronger in people with mental illnesses and in socio-economically disadvantaged groups, such as stigmatized minorities, migrants, and homeless persons [1], many of them also having high risk for suicidal behaviors [2]. Mental health disorders are pervasive worldwide; the global burden accounting for approximately 21.2-32.4% of years lived with disability-more than any other group of illnesses [3]. So, the vulnerable group of people with mental health disorders represents a considerable share of the total global population.","Wasserman, Danuta; van der Gaag, Rutger; Wise, Jan",Eur Psychiatry,,34

Governments around the world are facing a tough challenge that could jeopardise the national healthcare systems. Safeguarding the rights of Covid patients and all citizens - especially those who are now even more vulnerable than they were before - is part of this challenge. This work aims to examine the issues arising from the current emergency in terms of how individuals' constitutional rights have been balanced and how much people at the highest risk amid this pandemic - the homeless, the inmates in prison, geriatric and psychiatric patients, and doctors on the Covid frontline - have been protected. This analysis focuses mostly on one of the worst-hit countries by the SARS-CoV-2: Italy.","Cioffi, A; Ruggiero, M; Rinaldi, R",Clin Ter,,34

258349,A systematic review of health sector responses to the coincidence of disasters and COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: As there is no treatment for COVID-19 with a proven mortality benefit at this moment in the pandemic, supportive management including mechanical ventilation is the core management in an intensive care unit (ICU). It is a challenge to provide consistent care in this situation, highly demanding and leading to potential staff shortages in ICU. We need to reduce unnecessary exposure of healthcare workers to the virus. This study aims to examine the impact of care using a non-invasive oscillating device (NIOD) for chest physiotherapy in the care of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. In particular, we aim to explore if a NIOD performed by non-specialized personnel is not inferior to the standard chest physiotherapy (CPT) undertaken by physiotherapists caring for patients with COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN: A pilot multicenter prospective crossover noninferiority randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: All mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 admitted to one of the two ICUs, and CPT ordered by the responsible physician. The participants will be recruited from two intensive care units in Canadian Academic Hospitals (one pediatric and one adult ICU). INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: We will implement NIOD and CPT alternatingly for 3 h apart over 3 h. We will apply a pragmatic design, so that other procedures including hypertonic saline nebulization, intermittent positive pressure ventilation, suctioning (e.g., oral or nasal), or changing the ventilator settings or modality (i.e., increasing positive end-expiratory pressure or changing the nasal mask to total face continuous positive airway pressure) can be provided at the direction of bedside intensivists in charge. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome measurement is the oxygenation level before and after the procedure (SpO2/FiO2 ratio). For cases with invasive ventilation (i.e., the use of an endotracheal tube to deliver positive pressure) and non-invasive ventilation, we will also document expiratory tidal volume, vital signs, and any related complications such as vomiting, hypoxemia, or unexpected extubation. We will collect the data before, 10 min after, and 30 min after the procedure. RANDOMIZATION: The order of the procedures (i.e., NIOD or CPT) will be randomly allocated using manual generated random numbers for each case. Randomization will be carried out by the independent research assistant in the study coordinating center by using opaque sealed envelopes, assigning an equal number of cases to each intervention arm. Stratification will be applied for age (> 18 years or &#8804; 18 years of age) and the study sites. BLINDING (MASKING): No blinding will be performed. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): We estimate the necessary sample size as 25 for each arm (total 50 cases), with a power of 0.90 and an alpha of 0.05, with a non-inferiority design. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol version number 1 was approved on 27 March 2020. Currently, recruitment has not yet started, with the start scheduled by the mid-June 2020 and the end anticipated by December 2020. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04361435 .

263975,Belgium: Health System Review,2020,"Air pollution is a threat to human health, in particular since it aggravates respiratory diseases. Early COVID-19 outbreaks in Wuhan, China and Lombardy, Italy coincided with high levels of air pollution drawing attention to a potential role of particulate matter and other pollutants in infections and more severe outcomes of the new lung disease. Both air pollution and COVID-19 outcomes are driven by human mobility and economic activity leading to spurious correlations in regression estimates. We use district-level panel data from Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the US to estimate the impact of daily variation in air pollution levels on COVID-19 infections and deaths. Using random variation in air pollution generated by thermal inversions, we rule out that changes in mobility and economic activity are driving the results. We find that a 1%-increase in air pollution levels over the three preceding weeks leads to a 1.5% increase in weekly cases. A 1%-increase in air pollution over four weeks leads to 5.1% more COVID-19 deaths. These results indicate that short-term measures to reduce air pollution can help mitigate the health damages of the virus.","Klauber, Hannah; Koch, Nicolas; Kraus, Sebastian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.11127v1.pdf,34

Here, we develop a computational strategy to adaptively evolve peptides that could selectively inhibit mutating S protein receptor binding domains (RBDs) of different SARS-CoV-2 viral strains from binding to their human host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Starting from suitable peptide templates, based on selected ACE2 segments (natural RBD binder), we gradually modify the templates by random mutations, while retaining those mutations that maximize their RBD-binding free energies. In this adaptive evolution, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the template-RBD complexes are iteratively perturbed by the peptide mutations, which are retained under favorable Monte Carlo decisions. The computational search will provide libraries<br>of optimized therapeutics capable of reducing the SARS-CoV-2 infection on a global scale. <br>.","Chaturvedi, Parth; Han, Yanxiao; Král, Petr; Vukovic, Lela",,,34
267836,Delayed symptoms in patients recovered from covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The pathomechanisms of hypoxemia and treatment strategies for type H and type L acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been elucidated. MAIN TEXT: SARS-CoV-2 mainly targets the lungs and blood, leading to ARDS, and systemic thrombosis or bleeding. Angiotensin II-induced coagulopathy, SARS-CoV-2-induced hyperfibrin(ogen)olysis, and pulmonary and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation due to immunothrombosis contribute to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. Type H ARDS is associated with hypoxemia due to diffuse alveolar damage-induced high right-to-left shunts. Immunothrombosis occurs at the site of infection due to innate immune inflammatory and coagulofibrinolytic responses to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in microvascular occlusion with hypoperfusion of the lungs. Lung immunothrombosis in type L ARDS results from neutrophil extracellular traps containing platelets and fibrin in the lung microvasculature, leading to hypoxemia due to impaired blood flow and a high ventilation/perfusion (VA/Q) ratio. COVID-19-associated ARDS is more vascular centric than the other types of ARDS. D-dimer levels have been monitored for the progression of microvascular thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. Early anticoagulation therapy in critical patients with high D-dimer levels may improve prognosis, including the prevention and/or alleviation of ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: Right-to-left shunts and high VA/Q ratios caused by lung microvascular thrombosis contribute to hypoxemia in type H and L ARDS, respectively. D-dimer monitoring-based anticoagulation therapy may prevent the progression to and/or worsening of ARDS in COVID-19 patients.","Gando, Satoshi; Wada, Takeshi",Shock (Augusta Ga.),,34

271171,Under COVID-19 Pandemic: A Quasi-Experimental Trial of Observation on Diabetes Patients' Health Behavior Affected by the Pandemic From a Coaching Intervention Program,2021,"Microcystin-leucine-arginine (MLCR) is a cyanobacterial toxin, and has been demonstrated to cause neurotoxicity. In addition, MCLR has been identified as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase (PP)1 and PP2A, which are known to regulate the phosphorylation of various molecules related to synaptic excitability. Thus, in the present study, we examined whether MCLR exposure affects seizures induced by a low dose of kainic acid (KA; 0.05â¯µg, i.c.v.) administration. KA-induced seizure occurrence and seizure score significantly increased after repeated exposure to MCLR (2.5 or 5.0â¯µg/kg, i.p., once a day for 10 days), but not after acute MCLR exposure (2.5 or 5.0â¯µg/kg, i.p., 2â¯h and 30â¯min prior to KA administration), and hippocampal neuronal loss was consistently facilitated by repeated exposure to MCLR. In addition, repeated MCLR significantly elevated the membrane expression of kainate receptor GluK2 subunits, p-pan-protein kinase C (PKC), and p-extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) at 1â¯h after KA. However, KA-induced membrane expression of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) was significantly reduced by repeated MCLR exposure. Consistent with the enhanced seizures and neurodegeneration, MCLR exposure significantly potentiated KA-induced oxidative stress and microglial activation, which was accompanied by increased expression of p-ERK and p-PKCÎ´ in the hippocampus. The combined results suggest that repeated MCLR exposure potentiates KA-induced excitotoxicity in the hippocampus by increasing membrane GluK2 expression and enhancing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation through the modulation of p-CaMKII, p-PKC, and p-ERK.","Hwang, Yeonggwang; Kim, Hyoung-Chun; Shin, Eun-Joo",Toxicology,,34

274635,"The COVID-19 Pandemic: An Epidemiologic, Public Health, and Clinical Brief",2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread around the world and has increased the public's need for health information in the process. Meanwhile, in the context of lockdowns and other measures for preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread, the internet has surged as a web-based resource for health information. Under these conditions, social question-and-answer communities (SQACs) are playing an increasingly important role in improving public health literacy. There is great theoretical and practical significance in exploring the influencing factors of SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish an extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model that could analyze the influence factors of SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information. Particularly, we tried to test the moderating effects that different demographic characteristics had on the variables' influences. METHODS: This study was conducted by administering a web-based questionnaire survey and analyzing the responses from a final total of 598 valid questionnaires after invalid data were cleaned. By using structural equation modelling, the influencing factors of SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information were analyzed. The moderating effects of variables were verified via hierarchical regression. RESULTS: Performance expectation (ß=.282; P<.001), social influence (ß=.238; P=.02), and facilitating conditions (ß=.279; P=.002) positively affected users' willingness to adopt health information, whereas effort expectancy (P=.79) and perceived risk (P=.41) had no significant effects. Gender had a significant moderating effect in the structural equation model (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information was evidently affected by multiple factors, such as performance expectation, social influence, and facilitating conditions. The structural equation model proposed in this study has a good fitting degree and good explanatory power for users' willingness to adopt health information. Suggestions were provided for SQAC operators and health management agencies based on our research results.","Li, PengFei; Xu, Lin; Tang, Tingting; Wu, Xiaoqian; Huang, Cheng",J Med Internet Res,,34

281414,Violence and discrimination among Ugandan residents during the COVID-19 lockdown,2021,"We study the spread of Covid-19 across neighbourhoods of cities in the developing world and find that small numbers of neighbourhoods account for a majority of cases (k-index~0.7). We also find that the countrywide distribution of cases across states/provinces in these nations also displays similar inequality, indicating self-similarity across scales. Neighbourhoods with slums are found to contain the highest density of cases across all cities under consideration, revealing that slums constitute the most at-risk urban locations in this epidemic. We present a stochastic network model to study the spread of a respiratory epidemic through physically proximate and accidental daily human contacts in a city, and simulate outcomes for a city with two kinds of neighbourhoods - slum and non-slum. The model reproduces observed empirical outcomes for a broad set of parameter values - reflecting the potential validity of these findings for epidemic spread in general, especially across cities of the developing world. We also find that distribution of cases becomes less unequal as the epidemic runs its course, and that both peak and cumulative caseloads are worse for slum neighbourhoods than non-slums at the end of an epidemic. Large slums in the developing world therefore contain the most vulnerable populations in an outbreak, and the continuing growth of metropolises in Asia and Africa presents significant challenges for future respiratory outbreaks from perspectives of public health and socioeconomic equity.","Sahasranaman, Anand; Jensen, Henrik Jeldtoft",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.06958v1.pdf,34
281611,DNA fragmentation of sperm in automobile painters,2021,"Pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 is frequently associated with alterations in oxygenation. The arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is the most clinically used variable to assess such oxygenation, since it decisively influences the oxygen transported by hemoglobin (expressed by its percentage of saturation, SaO2). However, two recent studies conducted respectively in silico and using omic techniques in red blood cells of COVID-19 patients have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could decrease the affinity of oxygen for the hemoglobin (which would imply that PaO2 would overestimate SaO2), and also reduce the amount of this carrier molecule. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate this hypothesis in blood samples from COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Blood gases of all COVID-19 patients performed in our laboratory in two months were included, as well as those from two control groups: synchronous patients with negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (SCG) and a historical group (HCG). Both SaO2 and venous saturations (SvO2) measured by cooximetry (COX) were compared separately with those calculated using the Kelman (K), Severinghaus (SV) and Siggaard-Andersen (SA) equations in each group. RESULTS: Measured and calculated SaO2 and SvO2 were practically equivalent in all groups. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for SaO2 in COVID-19 were 0.993 for COX-K and 0.992 for both COX-SV and COX-SA; being 0.995 for SvO2 for either COX-K, COX-SV or COX-SA. Hemoglobin and ferritin were slightly higher in COVID-19 compared to SCG and HCG (hemoglobin, p < 0.001 for both; ferritin, p < 0.05 for SCG and p < 0.001 for HCG). CONCLUSION: Under clinical conditions SARS-CoV-2 does not have an appreciable influence on the affinity of oxygen for the hemoglobin, nor on the levels of this carrier molecule. Therefore, PaO2 is a good marker of blood oxygenation also in COVID-19.","Pascual-Guàrdia, Sergi; Ferrer, Antoni; Díaz, Óscar; Caguana, Antonio O; Tejedor, Elvira; Bellido-Calduch, Salomé; Rodríguez-Chiaradia, Diego A; Gea, Joaquim",Arch. bronconeumol.

281965,"Temporary ""Circuit Breaker"" Lockdowns Could Effectively Delay a COVID-19 Second Wave Infection Peak to Early Spring",2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has spread rapidly in China and around the world. Published studies have revealed that some patients with COVID-19 had abnormal liver function in laboratory tests. However, the results were inconsistent and the analysis of epidemiological data stratified by the severity of COVID-19 was not available in previous meta-analyses. Furthermore, these meta-analyses were suspected of overestimating the incidence of liver injury in patients with COVID-19 because some studies considered transaminase elevation as liver injury, which might partially result from cardiac and muscle injury. This systematic review aims to enrol published literatures related to COVID-19 without language restriction, analyse the data based on the severity of the COVID-19 and explore the impact of varied definitions of liver injury on the incidence of liver injury. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We have conducted a preliminary search on PubMed and Excerpta Medica Database on 13 April 2020, for the studies published after December 2019 on the prevalence of acute liver injury and hypertransaminemia in patients with COVID-19. Two reviewers will independently screen studies, extract data and assess the risk of bias. We will estimate the pooled incidence of hypertransaminemia and acute liver injury in patients with COVID-19 by using the random-effects model. The I² test will be used to identify the extent of heterogeneity. Publication bias will be assessed by funnel plot and performing the Begg's and Egger's test if adequate studies are available. We will perform a risk of bias assessment using the Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal checklist. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Since this study will be based on the published data, it does not require ethical approval. The final results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), neurological symptoms, syndromes, and complications associated with this multi-organ viral infection have been reported and the various aspects of neurological involvement are increasingly uncovered. As a neuro-inflammatory disorder, one would expect to observe opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome after a prevalent viral infection in a pandemic scale, as it has been the case for many other neuro-inflammatory syndromes. We report seven cases of opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome presumably parainfectious in nature and discuss their phenomenology, their possible pathophysiological relationship to COVID-19, and diagnostic and treatment strategy in each case. Finally, we review the relevant data in the literature regarding the opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome and possible similar cases associated with COVID-19 and its diagnostic importance for clinicians in various fields of medicine encountering COVID-19 patients and its complications.","Emamikhah, Maziar; Babadi, Mansoureh; Mehrabani, Mehrnoush; Jalili, Mehdi; Pouranian, Maryam; Daraie, Peyman; Mohaghegh, Fahimeh; Aghavali, Sharmin; Zaribafian, Maryam; Rohani, Mohammad",J. neurovirology,,34

285783,How Well the Government of Nepal Is Responding to COVID-19? An Experience From a Resource-Limited Country to Confront Unprecedented Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Protein-energy wasting, muscle mass (MM) loss and sarcopenia are highly prevalent and associated with poor outcome in haemodialysis (HD) patients. Monitoring of MM and/or muscle metabolism in HD patients is of paramount importance for timely detection of muscle loss and to intervene adequately. In this study we assessed the reliability and reproducibility of a simplified creatinine index (SCI) as a surrogate marker of MM and explored its predictive value on outcome. METHOD: We included all in-centre HD patients from 16 European countries with at least one SCI. The baseline period was defined as 30 days before and after the first multifrequency bioimpedance spectroscopy measurement; the subsequent 7 years constituted the follow-up. SCI was calculated by the Canaud equation. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were applied to assess the association of SCI with all-cause mortality. Using backward analysis, we explored the trends of SCI before death. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to analyse the agreement between estimated and measured MM. RESULTS: We included 23 495 HD patients; 3662 were incident. Females and older patients have lower baseline SCI. Higher SCI was associated with a lower risk of mortality [hazard ratio 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.79-0.82)]. SCI decline accelerated â¼5-7 months before death. Lean tissue index (LTI) estimated by SCI was correlated with measured LTI in both sexes (males: R2 = 0.94; females: R2 = 0.92; both P < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis showed that measured LTI was 4.71 kg/m2 (±2 SD: -12.54-3.12) lower than estimated LTI. CONCLUSION: SCI is a simple, easily obtainable and clinically relevant surrogate marker of MM in HD patients.","Canaud, Bernard; Ye, Xiaoling; Usvyat, Len; Kooman, Jeroen; van der Sande, Frank; Raimann, Jochen; Wang, Yuedong; Kotanko, Peter",Nephrol. dial. transplant,,34

Hence, applying preventive measures is the most critical intervention to control the infection. Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to respiratory pathogens because of their immunosuppressive state and physiological adaptive change during pregnancy. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess knowledge and practice to prevent coronavirus disease and its associated factors among pregnant women in Debre Tabor Town. METHODS: Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 422 participants from May 25-June 15, 2020. A simple random sampling technique was employed. Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire and analysis using SPSS version 23. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out and p-value < 0.05 at 95% CI were considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: Overall 46.8 and 47.6% of women were knowledgeable and had good practice to prevent coronavirus respectively. Women's age (15-24 years) (AOR = 4.85, 95% CI: 1.34-5.42), educational status (AOR:3.70; 95% CI: 1.16-5.40) being civil servant (AOR:2.84; 95% CI: 1.55-5.21), wanted pregnancy (AOR:3.37; 95% CI: 1.20-9.45), antenatal care follow-up (AOR:2.07; 95% CI: 1.03-4.13) were significantly associated with COVID-19 knowledge, whereas educational status (AOR:3.78; 95% CI: 1.19-5.11), number of children (AOR:2.89; 95% CI: 1.29-6.45) and knowledge (AOR:8.42;95% CI: 4.50-15.85), were also found to be statistically significant with practice. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the participants had poor knowledge and inappropriate practice. Increasing health education programs via different media, coordinated and combined efforts of authorities and all individuals will be needed to battles the spread of the infection.","Ayele, Alemu Degu; Mihretie, Gedefaye Nibret; Belay, Habtamu Gebrehana; Teffera, Adanech Getie; Kassa, Bekalu Getnet; Amsalu, Bedemariam Tadesse",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,34

This relates particularly to the development of myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, arrhythmia, and heart failure. Prospective treatment approach is advised for these patients. To study the interplay between local changes (reduced contractility), global variables (peripheral resistances, heart rate) and the cardiac function, we considered a lumped parameters computational model of the cardiovascular system and a three-dimensional multiphysics model of cardiac electromechanics. Our mathematical model allows to simulate the systemic and pulmonary circulations, the four cardiac valves and the four heart chambers, through equations describing the underlying physical processes. By the assessment of conventionally relevant parameters of cardiac function obtained through our numerical simulations, we propose a computational model to effectively reveal the interactions between the cardiac and pulmonary functions in virtual subjects with normal and impaired cardiac function at baseline affected by mild or severe COVID-19.","Dedè, Luca; Regazzoni, Francesco; Vergara, Christian; Zunino, Paolo; Guglielmo, Marco; Scrofani, Roberto; Fusini, Laura; Cogliati, Chiara; Pontone, Gianluca; Quarteroni, Alfio",Math Biosci Eng,,34

In response, U.S. hospitals altered their care delivery systems, but there are few data regarding specific structural changes. Understanding these changes is important to guide interpretation of outcomes and inform pandemic preparedness. We sought to characterize emergency responses across hospitals in the United States over time and in the context of local case rates early in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. DESIGN: We surveyed hospitals from a national acute care trials group regarding operational and structural changes made in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic from January to August 2020. We collected prepandemic characteristics and changes to hospital system, space, staffing, and equipment during the pandemic. We compared the timing of these changes with county-level coronavirus disease 2019 case rates. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: U.S. hospitals participating in the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury Network Coronavirus Disease 2019 Observational study. Site investigators at each hospital collected local data. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-five sites participated (94% response rate). System-level changes (incident command activation and elective procedure cancellation) occurred at nearly all sites, preceding rises in local case rates. The peak inpatient census during the pandemic was greater than the prior hospital bed capacity in 57% of sites with notable regional variation. Nearly half (49%) expanded ward capacity, and 63% expanded ICU capacity, with nearly all bed expansion achieved through repurposing of clinical spaces. Two-thirds of sites adapted staffing to care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019, with 48% implementing tiered staffing models, 49% adding temporary physicians, nurses, or respiratory therapists, and 30% changing the ratios of physicians or nurses to patients. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic prompted widespread system-level changes, but front-line clinical care varied widely according to specific hospital needs and infrastructure. Linking operational changes to care delivery processes is a necessary step to understand the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on patient outcomes.","Mathews, Kusum S; Seitz, Kevin P; Vranas, Kelly C; Duggal, Abhijit; Valley, Thomas S; Zhao, Bo; Gundel, Stephanie; Harhay, Michael O; Chang, Steven Y; Hough, Catherine L",Crit. care med,,34

Our method, which we call SUBSET, is a model-based approach which uses a penalised likelihood to detect changes for a wide class of parametric settings. We provide theory that guides the choice of penalties to use for SUBSET, and that shows it has high power to detect changes regardless of whether only a few variates or many variates change. Empirical results show that SUBSET out-performs many existing approaches for detecting changes in mean in Gaussian data; additionally, unlike these alternative methods, it can be easily extended to non-Gaussian settings such as are appropriate for modelling counts of terrorist events.","Tickle, S.

295618,Hospital attendance and admission trends for cardiac diseases during the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown in Greece,2020,"The seasonal variability of the lateral flux of total alkalinity (TAlk) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of the tropical Hooghly estuary is analyzed in this work. In situ observations of water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, TAlk, and pH were measured in four different stations of the Hooghly estuary. It was measured once every month during 2015-2016, and subsequently, DIC was estimated. A carbon budget was constructed to quantify carbon flows through the freshwater-marine continuum of the Hooghly estuary, and plausible impacts on the adjacent coastal ocean, the northern Bay of Bengal, were examined. The biogeochemical mass balance box model was used to compute the seasonal flow of carbon flux, and subsequently, the annual budgeting of lateral fluxes of TAlk and DIC to the adjacent coastal ocean was carried out. The net annual TAlk and DIC flux from the Hooghly estuary to the adjacent coastal ocean were 4.45 ± 1.90 × 1011 mol and 4.59 ± 1.70 × 1011 mol, respectively. The net annual DIC flux of the Hooghly estuary is about 30 to 60 times higher than surface area integrated air-water CO2 flux, which is an indication of promoting acidification in the adjacent coastal ocean. The present study indicates that the lateral DIC flux has increased substantially in the Hooghly estuary during the last two decades. The increase in inorganic carbon load in the Hooghly estuary due to the enhanced discharge of inorganic and organic matter load in the upper reaches of the estuary led to this increase in lateral DIC flux. The results strongly establish the need of having such regional studies for better understanding the estuarine carbon dynamics, and its role in controlling the adjacent coastal ocean dynamics.","Ghosh, Jayashree; Chakraborty, Kunal; Chanda, Abhra; Akhand, Anirban; Bhattacharya, Trishneeta; Das, Sourav; Das, Isha; Hazra, Sugata; Choudhury, S B; Wells, Mark",Environ Monit Assess,,34

However, there have been no reported cases with positive GM1 or GQ1b antibodies in the literature to date. Although clinically similar, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 related GBS and MFS may be significantly different from cases in the pre-pandemic era. Case presentation: We present a patient with ascending areflexic weakness consistent with GBS with positive GM1 antibody. The patient had recovered from COVID-19 infection two weeks prior with mild viral illness and symptoms. Her weakness was isolated to the lower extremities and improved after intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. Patient recovered eventually. Conclusions: - The general lack of reported ganglioside antibodies supports a novel target(s) for molecular mimicry as the underlying etiology, which raises the concern for possible vaccine induced complication. Whether the current GM1 positive case is a sequalae of COVID-19 or a mere coincidence is inconclusive. Further understanding of the disease mechanism of pandemic era GBS and MFS, including antigen target(s) of COVID-19, may be of utmost importance to the development of a safe COVID-19 vaccine.","Dufour, Catherine; Co, Thien-Kim; Liu, Antonio",Brain Behav Immun Health,,34

Students discussed the challenges they endured because of the diminished time from these new responsibilities. They shared strategies implemented and sacrifices made to manage. Support from faculty and staff was critical to their academic persistence. Increased faculty flexibility and synthesizing information about remote resources can help student parents better manage during the pandemic.","Manze, Meredith G.; Rauh, Lauren Smith-Faust Polly Watnick Dana",Emerging Adulthood,,34

Emerging findings point to existing disparities in health systems and services being further exacerbated, with marginalized populations and low- and middle-income countries burdened disproportionately. More broadly, there is a need to further understand short- and long-term impacts of bypassed essential services, quality assurance of services, the role of primary health care in the frontline, and the need for additional mechanisms for effective vaccine messaging and uptake during epidemics. The review also highlights how trust-of institutions, of science, and between communities and health systems-remains central to a successful pandemic response. Finally, previous crises had repeatedly foreshadowed the inability of health systems to handle upcoming pandemics, yet the reactive nature of policies and practices compounded by lack of resources, infrastructure, and political will have resulted in the current failed response to COVID-19. There is therefore an urgent need for investments in implementation science and for strategies to bridge this persistent research-practice gap.","Baral, Prativa",Int J Health Serv,,34

However, the effectiveness of different NPIs at reducing transmission is poorly understood. We gathered chronological data on the implementation of NPIs for several European, and other, countries between January and the end of May 2020. We estimate the effectiveness of NPIs, ranging from limiting gathering sizes, business closures, and closure of educational institutions to stay-at-home orders. To do so, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model that links NPI implementation dates to national case and death counts and supported the results with extensive empirical validation. Closing all educational institutions, limiting gatherings to 10 people or less, and closing face-to-face businesses each reduced transmission considerably. The additional effect of stay-at-home orders was comparatively small.","Brauner, Jan M; Mindermann, Sören; Sharma, Mrinank; Johnston, David; Salvatier, John; Gavenciak, Tomás; Stephenson, Anna B; Leech, Gavin; Altman, George; Mikulik, Vladimir; Norman, Alexander John; Monrad, Joshua Teperowski; Besiroglu, Tamay; Ge, Hong; Hartwick, Meghan A; Teh, Yee Whye; Chindelevitch, Leonid; Gal, Yarin; Kulveit, Jan",Science (Wash.),,34

Nevertheless, there is a paucity of research on the COVID-19 impact on people with dementia and their care partners. OBJECTIVE: Using Twitter, the purpose of this study is to understand the experiences of COVID-19 for people with dementia and their care partners. METHODS: We collected tweets on COVID-19 and dementia using the GetOldTweets application in Python from February 15 to September 7, 2020. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the tweets. RESULTS: From the 5063 tweets analyzed with line-by-line coding, we identified 4 main themes including (1) separation and loss; (2) COVID-19 confusion, despair, and abandonment; (3) stress and exhaustion exacerbation; and (4) unpaid sacrifices by formal care providers. CONCLUSIONS: There is an imminent need for governments to rethink using a one-size-fits-all response to COVID-19 policy and use a collaborative approach to support people with dementia. Collaboration and more evidence-informed research are essential to reducing COVID-19 mortality and improving the quality of life for people with dementia and their care partners.","Bacsu, Juanita-Dawne; O039,; Connell, Megan E; Cammer, Allison; Azizi, Mahsa; Grewal, Karl; Poole, Lisa; Green, Shoshana; Sivananthan, Saskia; Spiteri, Raymond J",J Med Internet Res,,34

307736,Contact Tracing for Containment of Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in the Early Phase of the Epidemic in the Maldives,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many countries applying restrictive measures, such as lockdown, to contain and prevent further spread. The psychological impact of lockdown and working as a healthcare worker on the frontline has been chronicled in studies pertaining to previous infectious disease pandemics that have reported the presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Potentially linked to psychological well-being and not yet studied is the possibility that lockdown and working on the frontline of the pandemic are associated with perceptions of coercion. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The present study aimed to examine perceived coercion in those who have experienced COVID-19-related lockdown and/or worked as a frontline healthcare worker across three European countries. It aimed to describe how such perceptions may impact on psychological well-being, coping and post-traumatic growth. It will employ an explanatory mixed-methods research methodology consisting of an online survey and online asynchronous virtual focus groups (AVFGs) and individual interviews. &#967;2 tests and analyses of variance will be used to examine whether participants from different countries differ according to demographic factors, whether there are differences between cohorts on perceived coercion, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic growth scores. The relationship between coercion and symptoms of distress will be assessed using multiple regression. Both the AVFGs and the narrative interviews will be analysed using thematic narrative analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by University College London's Research Ethics Committee under Project ID Number 7335/004. Results will be disseminated by means of peer-reviewed publications and at national and/or international conferences.","Ranieri, Veronica; Sem Stoltenberg, Andrea; Pizzo, Elena; Montaldo, Chiara; Bizzi, Emanuele; Edwards, Sarah; Kamboj, Sunjeev",BMJ Open,,34

311025,Three further ways that the COVID-19 pandemic will affect health outcomes,2020,"PURPOSE: To report historical patterns of pharmaceutical expenditures, to identify factors that may influence future spending, and to predict growth in drug spending in 2021 in the United States, with a focus on the nonfederal hospital and clinic sectors. METHODS: Historical patterns were assessed by examining data on drug purchases from manufacturers using the IQVIA National Sales Perspectives database. Factors that may influence drug spending in hospitals and clinics in 2021 were reviewed-including new drug approvals, patent expirations, and potential new policies or legislation. Focused analyses were conducted for biosimilars, cancer drugs, generics, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic influence, and specialty drugs. For nonfederal hospitals, clinics, and overall (all sectors), estimates of growth of pharmaceutical expenditures in 2021 were based on a combination of quantitative analyses and expert opinion. RESULTS: In 2020, overall pharmaceutical expenditures in the United States grew 4.9% compared to 2019, for a total of $535.3 billion. Utilization (a 2.9% increase) and new drugs (a 1.8% increase) drove this increase, with price changes having minimal influence (a 0.3% increase). Adalimumab was the top drug in 2020, followed by apixaban and insulin glargine. Drug expenditures were $35.3 billion (a 4.6% decrease) and $98.4 billion (an 8.1% increase) in nonfederal hospitals and clinics, respectively. In clinics, growth was driven by new products and increased utilization, whereas in hospitals the decrease in expenditures was driven by reduced utilization. Several new drugs that will influence spending are expected to be approved in 2021. Specialty and cancer drugs will continue to drive expenditures along with the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: For 2021, we expect overall prescription drug spending to rise by 4% to 6%, whereas in clinics and hospitals we anticipate increases of 7% to 9% and 3% to 5%, respectively, compared to 2020. These national estimates of future pharmaceutical expenditure growth may not be representative of any particular health system because of the myriad of local factors that influence actual spending.","Tichy, Eric M; Hoffman, James M; Suda, Katie J; Rim, Matthew H; Tadrous, Mina; Cuellar, Sandra; Clark, John S; Wiest, Michelle D; Matusiak, Linda M; Schumock, Glen T",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,34

314448,The Current Situation and Influencing Factors of Job Stress Among Frontline Nurses Assisting in Wuhan in Fighting COVID-19,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-ranging consequences for general physical and mental health. Country-specific research reveals a general reduction in mental and physical well-being, due to measures undertaken to stop the spread of COVID-19 disease. However, research is yet to examine the impact of the pandemic on global psychological distress and its effects upon vulnerable groups. Exploration of the factors that potentially mediate the relationship between stress and mental health during this period is needed, to assist in undertaking concrete measures to mitigate psychological distress and support vulnerable groups. Therefore, this study examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological distress globally, and identified factors that may exacerbate decline in mental health. N = 1653 participants (mean age 42.90 ± 13.63 years; 30.3% males) from 63 countries responded to the survey. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire and State Trait Anxiety Inventory, respectively. Other measures included the Perceived Stress Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale and the Brief Resilient Coping Scale. Globally, consistently high levels of stress, anxiety, depression and poor sleep were observed regardless of number of COVID-19 cases. Over 70% of the respondents had greater than moderate levels of stress, with 59% meeting the criteria for clinically significant anxiety and 39% reporting moderate depressive symptoms. People with a prior mental health diagnosis experienced greater psychological distress. Poor sleep, lower levels of resilience, younger age and loneliness significantly mediated the links between stress and depression, and stress and anxiety. Age-based differences revealed that younger age-groups were more vulnerable to stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Results show that these vulnerable individuals need more support. Age-specific interventions for modifiable factors that mediate the psychological distress need to urgently deployed to address the global mental health pandemic.","Varma, Prerna; Junge, Moira; Meaklim, Hailey; Jackson, Melinda L",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,34

Mobility has emerged as an indicator for human activity and, implicitly, for human interactions. Here, we study the coupling between mobility and COVID-19 dynamics and show that variations in global air traffic and local driving mobility can be used to stratify different disease phases. For ten European countries, our study shows a maximal correlation between driving mobility and disease dynamics with a time lag of [Formula: see text] days. Our findings suggest that trends in local mobility allow us to forecast the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 for a window of two weeks and adjust local control strategies in real time.","Linka, Kevin; Goriely, Alain; Kuhl, Ellen",,,34
315655,More Caution Needed for Patients Recovered From COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: International studies have suggested that social disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have led to sexual dysfunction, but the impact on males in the United States is less defined. AIM: To examine changes in male sexual function during the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate associated demographic variables. METHODS: Prepandemic survey data was collected between October 20, 2019 and March 1, 2020 on adult males in the United States. Follow-up survey data collected for comparison during the COVID-19 pandemic between August 1, 2020 and October 10, 2020 included International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) scores, Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety with 4 items (PHQ-4) scores, and questions regarding sexual frequency. Questions were also asked about mask-wearing habits, job loss, relationship changes, and proximity to individuals who tested positive for COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in prepandemic and pandemic male sexual function assessed by self-reported IIEF domain scores and sexual frequency RESULTS: Seventy six men completed both prepandemic and pandemic surveys with a mean age of 48.3 years. Overall, there were no differences in either overall IIEF score or any subdomain score when comparing men's pre-pandemic and pandemic survey data. There was an increase in sexual frequency during the pandemic with 45% of men reporting sex ten or more times per month during the pandemic compared to only 25% of men prior to the pandemic (P = .03). Among the subgroup of 36 men who reported a decrease in IIEF, the decrease was an average of 3.97, and significantly associated with higher PHQ-4 depression subscale scores (1.78 vs 1.03, P = .02). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased sexual frequency and no change in overall sexual function in males in the United States.

We found that both types of masks provided reasonably high fit test pass rates among our participants and there was no significant difference between the two brands (77% for the Fluidshield and 65% for the ProShield, P = 0.916). Ninety-two percent of the participants could find at least one well-fitted mask among these two types of masks. We also demonstrated that the user seal check had low accuracy and low concordance (kappa coefficient of 0.16 for the Fluidshield and 0.08 for the ProShield) when compared to the quantitative fit test, and hence was not a reliable method to test seal quality.","Williams, Daryl L; Kave, Benjamin; Lee, Keat; Segal, Reny; Krieser, Roni B; Mezzavia, Paul M; Ng, Irene",Anaesth Intensive Care,,34

To better understand the persistence of immune response and the proportion of the population who can develop one, the authors assessed patterns of immunoglobulin G (IgG) positivity over time in individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or IgG at a large national reference laboratory. More than 2.4 million SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology (initiated April 21, 2020) and 6.6 million nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) (initiated March 9, 2020) results on persons from across the United States as of July 10, 2020 were analyzed. Additional IgG serology results through August 11, 2020 were used for one household analysis. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity was observed in 91% (19,434/21,452) of individuals tested after a positive NAAT result and in 10% (7,831/80,968) after a negative NAAT result. Factors associated with seropositivity include age, region of patient residence, and interval between NAAT and IgG serology. The probability of persistent IgG seropositivity declined from 98.6% after 1 week to 74.3% after 2 months, less so in individuals ages &#8805;55 years than in younger groups. Specimens within 2 days from pairs of same-household members showed 92% IgG antibody concordance. Household adults were more frequently IgG positive prior to household children testing positive (36% versus 8%). IgG serology testing can identify an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 that varies based on age, sex, and duration since exposure. Loss of detectable IgG seropositivity occurs, in some patients, over weeks or months. Adults may be infecting household children.","Kaufman, Harvey W; Chen, Zhen; Meyer, William A; Wohlgemuth, Jay G",Popul. health manag. (Online),,34

Ensaio clínico de diferentes doses de remifentanila em gatas anestesiadas com isofluorano e submetidas a ovariohisterectomia. Dissertação (Mestrado em Ciências Cardiovasculares) Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal Fluminense. Introdução: A redução das doses dos fármacos obtidas com técnicas anestésicas balanceadas tem como propósito diminuir a incidência de efeitos adversos, com o objetivo final de melhorar os resultados e a segurança dos procedimentos anestésicos. Na prática veterinária, a anestesia balanceada é normalmente realizada com a combinação de anestésicos inalatórios e opioides sistémicos. Por outro lado, a adição de analgésicos opioides aos anestésicos gerais pode proporcionar bloqueio autonómico eficaz. Consequentemente, estudos clínicos que investigam a associação de opioides à anestésicos inalatórios são justificados para melhor definir seu papel clínico na anestesia felina. Objetivo: o objetivo deste estudo foi identificar uma dose que proporcionasse condições anestésicas e cirúrgicas ótimas, bem como comparar a resposta cardiovascular à estimulação cirúrgica, analgesia pós-operatória, duração e qualidade de recuperação anestésica entre as taxas de infusão de remifentanila testadas. Método: 27 gatas foram randomizadas para receber remifentanila 0,1 g.kg.min-1 (REMI01), 0,2 g.kg.min-1 (REMI02) ou 0,4 g.kg.min-1 (REMI04). Após a pré-medicação anestésica com acepromazina, indução com propofol, os gatos foram ventilados mecanicamente e a anestesia foi mantida em aproximadamente 1,0 concentração alveolar mínima (CAM) de isofluorano (1,63% de isofluorano final da expiração (EtISO)). A taxa de infusão de remifentanila foi aumentada ou diminuída em 20% se a pressão arterial aumentasse ou diminuísse em 20% aos valores anteriores. A frequência cardíaca (FC), pressão arterial sistólica (PAS), temperatura esofágica, oximetria de pulso (SpO2), concentração de CO2 final (EtCO2) e EtISO foram registradas em diferentes pontos de tempo durante a cirurgia. Meloxicam foi administrado antes do final da cirurgia. Os dados dentro de cada grupo de tratamento foram analisados utilizando uma análise de variância de modelo misto (ANOVA) e o teste de Friedman seguido por Wilcoxon. Foram utilizados testes post-hoc de Bonferroni ou Dunnet. Kruskal-Wallis seguido pelo teste de Dunn pós-hoc foram usados para comparar dados entre os grupos, significância foi estabelecida em (p <0,05). Resultados: o tempo de decúbito esternal e o tempo de posição quadrupedal foram significativamente maiores no REMI04 do que nos outros grupos. A PAS foi maior quando comparada com os valores basais nos grupos REMI01 e REMI02 do que no REMI04. Não foi observada diferença significativa no FC entre os grupos. Um gato em REMI01 e outro em REMI02 necessitaram de analgesia de resgate pós-operatória. Conclusão: a dose de 0,4 g.kg.min-1 é a mais apropriada para ser utilizado em gatas submetidas à ovariohisterectomia e anestesiadas com 1,0 CAM de isofluorano.","MACHADO, MARCELA LEMOS",,,34

METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 1131 COVID-19 patients. Longitudinal coagulation parameters and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Abnormal coagulation parameters were observed in patients with COVID-19, both at hospital admission (INR 2.3%, PT 7.9%, APTT 15.4%, TT 0.9%, FDP 2.3%, D-dimer 19.7%) and peak hospitalization (INR 4.8%, PT 13.4%, APTT 25.6%, TT 2.7%, FDP 10.4%, D-dimer 31.5%). Compared with non-severe patients with COVID-19, severe patients had a slightly higher INR, PT, APTT, whereas remarkably higher FDP and D-dimer (p < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, age > 60 years, male, obesity, comorbidity, abnormal D-dimer on hospital admission, and abnormal peak hospitalization PT, APTT, FDP and D-dimer were associated with COVID-19 severity. The extreme coagulation parameters abnormalities (PT > 16s, FDP > 50 ug/ml, and D-dimer > 5 ug/ml) were associated with a significantly higher mortality. CONCLUSION: Longitudinal coagulation parameters abnormalities are common in patients with COVID-19, and associated with disease severity and mortality. Monitoring coagulation parameters is advisable to improve the management of patients with COVID-19.","Xu, Wei; Fei, Ling; Huang, Chen Lu; Li, Wei Xia; Xie, Xu Dong; Li, Qiang; Chen, Liang",Aging (Albany NY),,34

Few studies have analyzed its characteristics, and some of them included cases without laboratory confirmation or reported only critical patients. We aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 associated headache in laboratory-confirmed cases. We conducted a retrospective evaluation of patients with COVID-19 and neurological symptoms. Patients who reported headache answered an interview about its clinical characteristics. Twenty-four patients with COVID-19 associated headache completed the interview. Mean age of patients was 53.8 (standard deviation-17.44), and 14 out of 24 (58.3%) were male. The majority (75%) had no previous history of headache. Fever was documented in 19 out of the 24 patients (79.1%). Headache was predominantly bifrontal or holocranial, in pressure, during hours, worsening with cough or physical activity. COVID-19 headache tends to appear in the first days of symptoms, be either frontal or holocranial and last for days. The quality of pain in pressure and the worsening with cough or physical activity were reported in most cases. We have not found any characteristic that could differentiate COVID-19 associated headache from other causes of headache, possibly because of its multifactorial mechanism.","Dos Anjos de Paula, Rafael César; de Maria Frota Vasconcelos, Thaís; da Costa, Francisco Bruno Santana; de Brito, Lara Albuquerque; Torres, Danielle Mesquita; Moura, Alissa Elen Formiga; Oliveira, Danilo Nunes; de Lima Henn, Guilherme Alves; Rodrigues, Pedro Gustavo Barros; de Sousa Pereira, Isabelle; Braga, Ianna Lacerda Sampaio; Rocha, Felipe Araújo; Frota, Norberto Anízio Ferreira; Carvalho, Fernanda Martins Maia; Pitombeira, Milena Sales; Tavares-Junior, José Wagner Leonel; Montenegro, Raquel Carvalho; Braga-Neto, Pedro; Nóbrega, Paulo Ribeiro; Sobreira-Neto, Manoel Alves",Mol.

329983,Major Depressive and Generalized Anxiety Disorders Among University Students During the Second Wave of COVID-19 Outbreak in Bangladesh,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Spain was one of the most affected countries during the first wave of COVID-19, having the highest mortality rate in Europe. The aim of this retrospective study is to estimate the impact that remdesivir-the first drug for COVID-19 approved in the EU-would have had in the first wave. METHODS: This study simulated the impact that remdesivir could have had on the Spanish National Health System (SNHS) capacity (bed occupancy) and the number of deaths that could have been prevented, based on two scenarios: a real-life scenario (without remdesivir) and an alternative scenario (with remdesivir). It considered the clinical results of the ACTT-1 trial in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia who required supplemental oxygen. The occupancy rates in general wards and ICUs were estimated in both scenarios. RESULTS: Remdesivir use could have prevented the admission of 2587 patients (43.75%) in the ICUs. It could have also increased the SNHS capacity in 5656 general wards beds and 1700 ICU beds, showing an increase in the number of beds available of 17.53% (95% CI 3.98%-24.42%) and 23.98% (95% CI 21.33%-28.22%), respectively, at the peak of the occupancy rates. Furthermore, remdesivir use could have prevented 7639 deaths due to COVID-19, which implies a 27.51% reduction (95% CI 14.25%-34.07%). CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir could have relieved the pressure on the SNHS and could have reduced the death toll, providing a better strategy for the management of COVID-19 during the first wave.","Soriano, Alejandro; Montejano, Rocío; Sanz-Moreno, José; Figueira, Juan Carlos; Grau, Santiago; Güerri-Fernández, Robert; Castro-Gómez, Antonio; Pérez-Román, Inés; Hidalgo-Vega, Álvaro; González-Domínguez, Almudena",Adv. ther,,34

[German]",2020,"PURPOSE: In this paper, we propose a simplified four-step retropharyngeal approach, whose aim is getting straight to the upper cervical spine minimizing complications. METHODS: While the classical retropharyngeal approach includes about 11 steps, ours is a four-step approach: patient positioning, skin-platysma incision, hyoid bone superolateral dissection and retropharyngeal blunt exposure. We avoid several steps of the classical anterior retropharyngeal approach, particularly dissection of submandibular gland, facial veins, external carotid artery and thyroid artery, bellies of the digastric muscle, hypoglossal nerve, thyrohyoid membrane and the internal branch of superior laryngeal nerve. RESULTS: We have adopted this technique for five patients: two patients had a C2-C3 herniated disk with myelopathy, two patients had unstable Hangman fracture with no bone fusion after 2-month treatment with rigid collar, and one patient had a C2-C3 osteophyte with dysphagia. The intraoperative time needed for reaching the retropharyngeal space was 15 (first case), 9 (second case), 7 min (third case-illustrative case-and fourth case), 8 min (fifth case). No complications occurred. CONCLUSION: Our simplification, avoiding several steps, is simple, effective, safe, and rapid and requires a simple learning curve.","De Bonis, Pasquale; Musio, Antonio; Mantovani, Giorgio; Pompucci, Angelo; Visani, Jacopo; Lofrese, Giorgio; Scerrati, Alba",Eur. spine j,,34

Chest computed tomographic (CT) scan may be another timesensitive option for identification. of COVID-19 in such patients. Objective: We report our experience of incorporating chest CT scan in the initial neuroimaging protocol for evaluation of acute stroke patients. Methods: All acute stroke patients underwent chest CT scan concurrent to CT head, CT angiogram of head and neck and CT perfusion for 4 months. We identified patients who had chest CT scan findings that were suggestive of COVID-19 including bilateral, multilobar ground glass opacification with a peripheral or posterior distribution, and/or consolidation (mainly in the lower lobes). All patients subsequently underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swab with contact isolation until COVID-19 could be excluded. Results: A total of 224 consecutive patients (mean age 62.12 years±SD;15.3) underwent acute stroke evaluation with a concurrent chest CT scan. The chest CT identified findings suggestive of COVID-19 in 11 (4.9%) patients. Subsequent PCR testing did not confirm the diagnosis of COVID- 19 in any of the patient. Another 99 patients (44%) without any findings suggestive of COVID-19 on chest CT scan underwent PCR testing. PCR testing did not confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19 in any of the patients. Four patients (4.3%) with chest CT scan findings suggestive of COVID-19 were found to have an ischemic stroke while 7 patients (5.9%) with chest CT scan findings suggestive of COVID-19 did not have any ischemic stroke (stroke mimic). Conclusions: We found a very low yield for identifying COVID-19 in acute stroke patients by performing chest CT scan concurrent to standard acute stroke neuroimaging protocol.","Ishfaq, M.

We conducted a cross-sectional study of all children aged 0-18 years diagnosed with COVID-19 using polymerase chain reaction in Qatar during the period 1st March to 31st July 2020. A generalised linear model with a binomial family and identity link was used to assess the association between selected factors and the prevalence of symptomatic infection. A total of 11 445 children with a median age of 8 years (interquartile range (IQR) 3-13 years) were included in this study. The prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 was 36.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 35.7-37.5), and it was similar between children aged <5 years (37.8%), 5-9 years (34.3%) and 10 + years (37.3%).

However, information on kidney damage in older patients with COVID-19 is limited. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in hospitalized adults and associated with poor prognosis. We sought to explore the association between AKI and mortality in older patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study in a large tertiary care university hospital in Wuhan, China. All consecutive inpatients older than 65 years with COVID-19 were enrolled in this cohort. Demographic data, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between patients with AKI and without AKI. The association between AKI and mortality was analyzed. RESULTS: Of 1764 in-hospital patients, 882 older adult cases were included in this cohort. The median age was 71 years (interquartile range: 68-77), 440 (49.9%) were men. The most presented comorbidity was cardiovascular diseases (58.2%), followed by diabetes (31.4%). Of 882 older patients, 115 (13%) developed AKI and 128 (14.5%) died. Patients with AKI had higher mortality than those without AKI (68 [59.1%] vs 60 [7.8%]; pâ <â .001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that increasing odds of in-hospital mortality are associated with higher interleukin-6 on admission, myocardial injury, and AKI. CONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury is not an uncommon complication in older patients with COVID-19 but is associated with a high risk of death. Physicians should be aware of the risk of AKI in older patients with COVID-19.","Yan, Qi; Zuo, Peiyuan; Cheng, Ling; Li, Yuanyuan; Song, Kaixin; Chen, Yuting; Dai, Yue; Yang, Yi; Zhou, Lun; Yu, Weiwei; Li, Yongsheng; Xie, Min; Zhang, Cuntai; Gao, Hongyu","J. gerontol.

340452,The impact of pre-existing conditions and perceived health status on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an established and potent independent risk factor for degenerative diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), Alzheimer disease, type II diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. HHcy has been shown to inhibit proliferation and promote inflammatory responses in endothelial cells (EC), and impair endothelial function, a hallmark for vascular injury. However, metabolic processes and molecular mechanisms mediating HHcy-induced endothelial injury remains to be elucidated. This study examined the effects of HHcy on the expression of microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA in human aortic EC treated with a pathophysiologically relevant concentration of homocysteine (Hcy 500 µM). We performed a set of extensive bioinformatics analyses to identify HHcy-altered metabolic and molecular processes. The global functional implications and molecular network were determined by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) followed by Cytoscape analysis. We identified 244 significantly differentially expressed (SDE) mRNA, their relevant functional pathways, and 45 SDE miRNA. HHcy-altered SDE inversely correlated miRNA-mRNA pairs (45 induced/14 reduced mRNA) were discovered and applied to network construction using an experimentally verified database. We established a hypothetical model to describe the biochemical and molecular network with these specified miRNA/mRNA axes, finding: 1) HHcy causes metabolic reprogramming by increasing glucose uptake and oxidation, by glycogen debranching and NAD+/CoA synthesis, and by stimulating mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production via NNT/IDH2 suppression-induced NAD+/NADP-NADPH/NADP+ metabolism disruption; 2) HHcy activates inflammatory responses by activating inflammasome-pyroptosis mainly through &#8595;miR193bâ&#8593;CASP-9 signaling and by inducing IL-1ß and adhesion molecules through the &#8595;miR29câ&#8593;NEDD9 and the &#8595;miR1256â&#8593;ICAM-1 axes, as well as GPCR and interferon &#945;/ß signaling; 3) HHcy promotes cell degradation by the activation of lysosome autophagy and ubiquitin proteasome systems; 4) HHcy causes cell cycle arrest at G1/S and S/G2 transitions, suppresses spindle checkpoint complex and cytokinetic abscission, and suppresses proliferation through &#8595;miRNA335/&#8593;VASH1 and other axes. These findings are in accordance with our previous studies and add a wealth of heretofore-unexplored molecular and metabolic mechanisms underlying HHcy-induced endothelial injury. This is the first study to consider the effects of HHcy on both global mRNA and miRNA expression changes for mechanism identification. Molecular axes and biochemical processes identified in this study are useful not only for the understanding of mechanisms underlying HHcy-induced endothelial injury, but also for discovering therapeutic targets for CVD in general.","Jan, Michael; Cueto, Ramon; Jiang, Xiaohua; Lu, Liu; Sardy, Jason; Xiong, Xinyu; Yu, Justine E; Pham, Hung; Khan, Mohsin; Qin, Xuebing; Ji, Yong; Yang, Xiao-Feng; Wang, Hong",Redox Biol,,34

However, no data exists on cardiac involvement in patients recovered from COVID-19 infection. We aimed to evaluate by global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) whether there is subclinical myocardial deformation after COVID-19 infection. Two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) was performed within 29.5 ± 4.5 days after COVID-19 treatment. The standard GLS limit was identified at < -18%. The patients were divided into two groups according to their hs-TnI levels during hospitalization as with (> 11.6 ng/dl) and without (< 11.6 ng/dl) myocardial injury. Patients' (n = 74) mean age was 59.9 years, and women were in the majority (60.8%). Of the patients, 43.2% of them were hypertensive, and 10.9% were diabetic. Abnormal LV-GLS values (> -18) were measured in 28 patients (37.8%). While 16 (57.1%) of these patients were in the group with myocardial injury, 12 (26.1%) of them were in the group without myocardial injury (p = 0.014). D-dimer, C reactive protein, white blood cell levels were higher in the group with myocardial injury (All p values < 0.05). Electrocardiographically, 9 (12.2%) patients had T wave inversion, while two patients had a bundle branch block. Subclinical left ventricular dysfunction was observed in approximately one-third of the patients at the one-month follow-up after COVID-19 infection. This rate was higher in those who develop myocardial injury during hospitalization. This result suggests that patients recovered from COVID-19 infection should be evaluated and followed in terms of cardiac involvement.","Özer, Savas; Candan, Lütfullah; Özyildiz, Ali Gökhan; Turan, Oguzhan Ekrem",Int. j. cardiovasc. imaging,,34

This paper explores the implications of such measures in the UK for disabled people, with a particular focus on measures designed to reduce and reshape the use of streets and public space. We divide UK measures into two broad categories. First, there are measures designed to reduce the use of streets and public spaces - eg rules requiring people to stay at home except in tightly prescribed circumstances and measures providing specific support (including food delivery and priority online shopping) for people designated as clinically extremely' vulnerable'. Second, there are measures designed to control the behaviour of people using streets and public space - eg rules on physical distancing and the use of face coverings. We explore the disability-related concerns associated with these types of measure. We also highlight the opportunities this crisis presents for embedding accessibility and inclusion more firmly into the fabric of our streets and call for renewed resistance to policies and practices shaped by ableist assumptions and attitudes.","Eskyte, Ieva; Lawson, Anna; Orchard, Maria; Andrews, Elizabeth",,,34

According to the clinical data of infected patients, radiologic evidence of lung edema is common and deserves clinical attention. Lung edema is a manifestation of acute lung injury (ALI) and may progress to hypoxemia and potentially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients diagnosed with ARDS have poorer prognosis and potentially higher mortality. Although no effective treatment is formally approved for COVID-19 infection, support of ventilation with oxygen therapy and sometimes mechanical ventilation is often required. Treatment with systemic and/or local glucocorticoids might be helpful to alleviate the pulmonary inflammation and edema, which may decrease the development and/or consequences of ARDS. In this article, we focus on the lung edema and ALI of patients with this widely transmitted COVID-19 infection in order to provide clinical indications and potential therapeutic targets for clinicians and researchers.","Li, Liyang; Huang, Qihong; Wang, Diane C.; Ingbar, David H.; Wang, Xiangdong",Clin.

On the other hand, the percentage of children discharged right after pediatric visit significantly decreased from 80% in January to 50% in April. After March 9th, we registered a change in the diagnoses of emergency department visits, with an increase in the percentage of non-infectious acute conditions and a decrease in infectious diseases, with two cases of a noteworthy delayed access to hospital care.

348960,The reasons for higher mortality rate in opium addicted patients with COVID-19: a narrative review,2021,"RATIONALE: Adolescents and young adults were identified internationally as a group with potentially low compliance rates with public health measures aimed at curbing the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although non-compliance research during pandemics has typically focused on concurrent correlates, less is known about how prior social and psychological risk factors are associated with non-compliance during pandemics. OBJECTIVE: This paper leverages a prospective-longitudinal cohort study with data before and during the pandemic to describe patterns of non-compliance with COVID- 19 related public health measures in young adults and to identify which characteristics increase the risk of non-compliance. METHODS: Data came from an ongoing cohort study in Zurich, Switzerland (n=737). Non-compliance with public health measures and concurrent correlates were measured at age 22. Antecedent sociodemographic, social, and psychological factors were measured at ages 15-20. Young adults generally complied with COVID-19 public health measures, although non-compliance with some measures (e.g., cleaning/disinfecting mobile phones, standing 1.5-2 meters apart) was relatively higher. RESULTS: Non-compliance, especially with hygiene-related measures, was more prevalent in males, and in individuals with higher education, higher SES, and a nonmigrant background. Non-compliance was higher in young adults who had previously scored high on indicators of ""antisocial potential,"" including low acceptance of moral rules, pre-pandemic legal cynicism, low shame/guilt, low self-control, engagement in delinquent behaviors, and association with delinquent peers. Young adults with low trust, including in the government's measures for fighting the virus, also complied less. CONCLUSIONS: In order to increase voluntary compliance with COVID-19 measures, public health campaigns should implement strategies that foster moral obligation and trust in authorities, or leverage trustworthy individuals in the community to disseminate information. For young adults with low self-control, self-monitoring, environmental restructuring, or nudging may increase compliance. Long-term investments into integrating youth with antisocial potential into society may decrease rule-breaking behaviors, including during pandemics when compliance saves lives.","Nivette, Amy; Ribeaud, Denis; Murray, Aja; Steinhoff, Annekatrin; Bechtiger, Laura; Hepp, Urs; Shanahan, Lilly; Eisner, Manuel",Soc Sci Med,,34

Methods: The compounds and action targets of eleven herbal medicines in Jinhua Qinggan Granules were collected via TCMSP. The genes corresponding to the targets were queried by the UniProt database, then the “herbal medicine-compound-target” network was established by Cytoscape software. The gene ontology (GO) function enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were performed by DAVID to predict their mechanism. Molecular docking was used to analyze the binding force of the core effective compounds in the “herbal medicine-compound-target” network with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). Results: The “herbal medicine-compound-target” network contained 154 compounds and 276 targets, and the key targets involved PTGS2, HSP90AB1, HSP90AA1, PTGS1, NCOA2, etc. GO function enrichment analysis revealed 278 items, including ATP binding, transcription factor activation and regulation of apoptosis process, etc. KEGG pathway enrichment screened 127 signaling pathways, including TNF, PI3K/Akt and HIF-1 signaling pathways related to lung injury protection. The results of molecular docking showed that formononetin, stigmasterol, beta-sitosterol, anhydroicaritin and other key compounds have a certain degree of affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase and ACE2.

358707,The Triple Aim Applied to Correctional Health Systems,2021,"The Government of Nepal issued a nationwide lockdown from 24 March to 21 July 2020, prohibiting domestic and international travels, closure of the border and non-essential services. There were only two confirmed cases from 610 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests and no fatalities when the government introduced nationwide lockdown. This study aimed to explore the overall scenario of COVID-19 including spatial distribution of cases; government efforts, and impact on public health, socio-economy, and education during the lockdown in Nepal. We collated and analyzed data using official figures from the Nepalese Ministry of Health and Population. Nepal had performed 7,791 RT-PCR tests for COVID-19, the highest number of tests during the lockdown. It has recorded its highest daily rise in coronavirus infections with a total of 740 new cases from the total of 4,483 RT-PCR tests performed on a single day. Nepal had reported a total of 17,994 positive cases and 40 deaths at the end of lockdown. The spatial distribution clearly shows that the cases were rapidly spreading from the southern part of the country where most points of entry and exit from India are located. To contain the spread of the virus, the government has also initiated various preventive measures and strategies during the lockdown. The Government of Nepal needs to allocate more resources, increase its capacity to test and trace, establish dedicated isolation and quarantine facility and impose local restrictions such as a local lockdown based on risk assessment rather than a nationwide lockdown.","Sharma, Kusum; Banstola, Amrit; Parajuli, Rishi Ram",Front Public Health,,34

However, unforeseen complications to childhood health have emerged secondary to the pandemic. Few studies to date have examined unintended complications of the pandemic in newborns and infants. In this Commentary, we discuss the impact that COVID-19 may have on inheritance of the newborn microbiome and its assembly throughout the first years of life. In the early stages of the pandemic when vertical transmission of COVID-19 was poorly understood, several studies reported increased rates of C-sections in COVID-19 positive women. Initial recommendations discouraged COVID-19 positive mothers from breastfeeding and participating in skin-to-skin care, advising them to isolate during their window of infectivity. These shifts in perinatal care can adversely impact microbial colonization during the first 1000 days of life. While obstetrical and neonatal management have evolved to reflect our current knowledge of perinatal transmission, we are observing other changes in early life exposures of infants, including increased attention to hygiene, fewer social interactions, and decreased global travel, all of which are major drivers of early-life gut colonization. Composition of the gut microbiota in adults directly impacts severity of infection, suggesting a role of microbial communities in modulating immune responses to COVID-19. Conversely, the role of the intestinal microbiome in susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 in newborns and children remains unknown. The onset of adulthood diseases is related to the establishment of a healthy gut microbiome during childhood. As we continue to define COVID-19 biology, further research is necessary to understand how acquisition of the neonatal microbiome is affected by the pandemic. Furthermore, infection control measures must be balanced with strategies that promote microbial diversity to impart optimal health outcomes and potentially modulate susceptibility of children to COVID-19.","Romano-Keeler, Joann; Zhang, Jilei; Sun, Jun",Gut Microbes,,34

For the first time, a distinction was made between an obligation for the notification of infectious diseases by physicians and a notification obligation for infectious agents by laboratories. The aim was to reduce the notification burden on physicians and thus to improve the quality of the notifications. Since then, numerous new obligations for notifications have been added.The aim of this work is to describe and discuss the mandatory notification of infectious diseases in Germany on the basis of their development - compared to previous regulations in Germany (Federal Communicable Diseases Act) as well as international and Europe-wide recommendations (IHR; decisions of the EU Commission 1999, 2018) - and to submit suggestions for improvement.Regarding the considerable increase in reporting requirements and reports in recent years, and the fact that the IfSG provides other surveillance systems in addition to mandatory reporting, the mandatory reporting system should be focused on the necessary reporting requirements. In a first step, the proposed abolition of the mandatory reporting of noroviruses and rotaviruses could relieve both the notifiers and the health authorities, thus enabling more efficient reporting and more intensive and better investigation by the health authorities.","Heudorf, Ursel; Gottschalk, René",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,34

363719,"Looking back from 2020, how cannabis use and related behaviours changed in Canada",2021,"INTRODUCTION: Little is known on prevalence of early return hospital admission of subjects with COVID-19 previously evaluated and discharged from emergency departments (EDs). This study aims to describe readmission rate within 14 days of patients with COVID-19 discharged from ED and to identify predictors of return hospital admission. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with COVID-19 discharged from two EDs. Return hospital admission was defined as an unscheduled return ED visit within 14 days after initial ED evaluation and discharge. We compared the group of patients who had a return hospital admission to those who did not. We also evaluated selected clinical characteristics (age, neutrophilia, SOFA, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein and D-dimer) associated with return hospital admission. RESULTS: Of 283 patients included in the study, 65 (22.9%) had a return ED visit within 14 days. 32 of those patients (11%) were then hospitalized, while the remaining 33 were again discharged. Patients requiring a return hospital admission was significantly older, had higher pro-calcitonin and D-dimer levels. Major predictors of return hospital admission were cognitive impairment (OR 17.3 [CI 4.7-63.2]), P/F < 300 mmHg (OR 8.6 [CI 1.6-44.3]), being resident in geriatric care facility (OR 7.6 [CI 2.1-26.4]) and neutrophilia (OR 5.8 [CI 1.6-22.0]). CONCLUSION: Several factors are associated with 14-day return hospital admission in COVID-19 subjects. These should be considered when assessing discharge risk in ED clinical practice.","Menditto, Vincenzo G; Fulgenzi, Francesca; Bonifazi, Martina; Gnudi, Umberto; Gennarini, Silvia; Mei, Federico; Salvi, Aldo",Am J Emerg Med,,34

In this paper, we discuss the relationship between oil price and inflation in Spain, at national and regional levels, and making the distinction between energy and non-energy inflation. To this end, we fit econometric models to measure the effect of oil price shocks on inflation and to predict them under different scenarios. Our results show that almost half of the volatility of changes in total inflation is explained by changes in oil price. As could be expected, the energy component of inflation drives this effect. We also find that, under the most likely scenarios, 1-year ahead total inflation will be moderate, with relevant differences across regions.","Topan, Ligia; Castro, César; Jerez, Miguel; Barge-Gil, Andrés",SERIEs (Berl),,34

367465,The psychotherapeutic practice and potential of mental health nurses: an Australian survey,2020,"BACKGROUND: End-of-life care is provided in a variety of healthcare settings, not just palliative care hospitals. This is one reason why it is very important to assess all barriers to end-of-life care and to provide safe and quality services to patients. This study was aimed at describing nurses' attitudes in providing end-of-life care and exploring barriers and facilitating behaviors of nurses in multi-profile hospitals in Eastern Europe. METHODS: A descriptive, correlational design was applied in this study, using a cross-sectional survey of 1320 registered nurses within 7 hospitals in Lithuania. RESULTS: Registered nurses working in the three different profiles emphasized safe and effective care and the importance of meeting the patient's spiritual needs at the end of life. The main barriers assigned by nurses caring for patients at the end of life were angry family members, inadequate understanding of nursing care by the patient's relatives; lack of time to talk to patients, lack of nursing knowledge to deal with the bereaved patient's family, lack of evaluation of nurses' opinions, and the evasion by physicians to talk about the diagnosis and their over-optimistic view of the situation. The main facilitating behaviors to improve nursing care were end-of-life training, volunteering, and family involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Spiritual needs were identified by nurses as the primary needs of patients at the end of life. Family-related barriers remain one of the main barriers to end-of-life care. Also, the behavior of physicians and their relationship with nurses remains one of the most sensitive issues in end-of-life care.","Blazeviciene, Aurelija; Laurs, Lina; Newland, Jamesetta A",BMC Palliat Care,,34

The study was conducted using a proprietary questionnaire that had been provided via the Internet to online respondents in Poland. The questionnaire questions included a socio-geographic assessment, proprietary questions assessing the respondents' current approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a standardised psychometric tool-GHQ-28. The study involved 2155 respondents, 99.8% of whom gave their consent for the participation in the study. A mean GHQ score was 29.25 ± 14.94 points. The criterion for minor mental disorders (&#8805;24 points) was met by 1272 (59.2%) respondents. In overall interpretation as well as in each of GHQ-28 subscales, women obtained significantly higher scores than men (p < 0.001). The restriction on earning opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly associated with the feeling of anxiety/insomnia severity among the respondents (9.96 vs. 8.82 points; p < 0.001).

Autopsies commonly show arterial thrombosis and severe endothelial damage. Endothelial damage, which can play an early and central pathogenic role in ARDS and thrombosis, activates the lectin pathway of complement. Mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2), the lectin pathway's effector enzyme, binds the nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulting in complement activation and lung injury. Narsoplimab, a fully human immunoglobulin gamma 4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody against MASP-2, inhibits lectin pathway activation and has anticoagulant effects. In this study, the first time a lectin-pathway inhibitor was used to treat COVID-19, six COVID-19 patients with ARDS requiring continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or intubation received narsoplimab under compassionate use. At baseline and during treatment, circulating endothelial cell (CEC) counts and serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were assessed. Narsoplimab treatment was associated with rapid and sustained reduction of CEC and concurrent reduction of serum IL-6, IL-8, CRP and LDH. Narsoplimab was well tolerated; no adverse drug reactions were reported. Two control groups were used for retrospective comparison, both showing significantly higher mortality than the narsoplimab-treated group. All narsoplimab-treated patients recovered and survived. Narsoplimab may be an effective treatment for COVID-19 by reducing COVID-19-related endothelial cell damage and the resultant inflammation and thrombotic risk.","Rambaldi, Alessandro; Gritti, Giuseppe; Micò, Maria Caterina; Frigeni, Marco; Borleri, Gianmaria; Salvi, Anna; Landi, Francesco; Pavoni, Chiara; Sonzogni, Aurelio; Gianatti, Andrea; Binda, Francesca; Fagiuoli, Stefano; Di Marco, Fabiano; Lorini, Luca; Remuzzi, Giuseppe; Whitaker, Steve; Demopulos, Gregory",Immunobiology,,34

Methods: We reviewed the clinical research, consisting of mainly case series, on reported neurologic manifestations of COVID-19. We also reviewed basic studies to understand the mechanism of these neurologic symptoms and signs. Results: We included 79 studies for qualitative synthesis and 63 studies for meta-analysis. The reported neurologic manifestations were olfactory/taste disorders (35.6%), myalgia (18.5%), headache (10.7%), acute cerebral vascular disease (8.1%), dizziness (7.9%), altered mental status (7.8%), seizure (1.5%), encephalitis, neuralgia, ataxia, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Miller Fisher syndrome, intracerebral hemorrhage, polyneuritis cranialis, and dystonic posture. Conclusions: Neurologic manifestations in COVID-19 may alert physicians and medical practitioners to rule in high-risk patients. The increasing incidence of olfactory/taste disorders, myalgia, headache, and acute cerebral vascular disease renders a possibility that COVID-19 could attack the nervous system. The cytokine secretion and bloodstream circulation (viremia) are among the most possible routes into the nervous system.","Tsai, Sheng-Ta; Lu, Ming-Kuei; San, Shao; Tsai, Chon-Haw",Front. Neurol.,,34

We found elevated levels of circulating endothelial cells (CECs), a biomarker of vascular injury, in COVID-19 convalescents compared to healthy controls. In particular, those with pre-existing conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) had more pronounced endothelial activation hallmarks than non-COVID-19 patients with matched cardiovascular risk. Several proinflammatory and activated T lymphocyte-associated cytokines sustained from acute infection to recovery phase, which correlated positively with CEC measures, implicating cytokine-driven endothelial dysfunction. Notably, we found higher frequency of effector T cells in our COVID-19 convalescents compared to healthy controls. The activation markers detected on CECs mapped to counter receptors found primarily on cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, raising the possibility of cytotoxic effector cells targeting activated endothelial cells.

Driving Action for a Correct Exercise Plan,2020,"The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is widely recognized as a complex and contentious space for oil exploration and production. Over the past few decades, the Niger Delta has witnessed large-scale mass peaceful mobilizations and rebellion-like conditions from violent militia groups. Oil companies have been implicated in violence perpetrated by Nigerian security forces. Local host communities have suffered greatly from corruption, political instability, violence and the environmental devastation of their farmlands and fishing grounds. Oil companies have increasingly turned to corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives to attempt to build or repair relations with oil-producing communities. There are also governmental and non-governmental humanitarian actors supporting various initiatives in the oil-producing areas. This article highlights the challenges that one long running micro-scale development project has faced due to the COVID 19 disease outbreak and the closure of all schools in Rivers State, Nigeria in March 2020.

Benefits and risks of systemic treatments remain unclear, with multiple clinical trials still ongoing. Radiotherapy could play a role in reducing the inflammatory response in the lungs and relieve life-threatening symptoms. METHODS: We designed a prospective study of Ultra-Low Doses of Therapy with Radiation Applied to COVID-19 (ULTRA-COVID) for patients who suffer pneumonia, are not candidates for invasive mechanical ventilation and show no improvement with medical therapy. RESULTS: We present the preliminary results of two patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia treated with ULTRA-COVID. After one radiotherapy session, significant clinical response and a good radiological response was observed in both cases, resulting in both patients being discharged from hospital in less than 2 weeks after radiation treatment. CONCLUSION: Preliminary clinical and radiological results suggest a potential benefit of treating COVID-19 pneumonia with ULTRA-COVID.

SciberPunks channel the voice of the environment and have special abilities for feeling and expressing data, such as the ability to taste it, or communicate it through living tattoos on the skin. The aim was to examine how environmental data could act as a bridge between people and nature, to encourage empathy towards 'more-than-human' perspectives. We engaged 5 participants in activities designed to lead them through a process of engaging with information and data in the process of building their personas. The activities utilised arts-based methods as we were interested in the experiential aspects of engaging with data and how we might foster creative and sensory experiences with it. Activities included drawing, writing and performing and were framed by a single story that took participants on a journey through time: past, present and future. Activities took place online, due to COVID-19.

378654,Research and Management of Rare Diseases in the COVID-19 Pandemic Era: Challenges and Countermeasures,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a systemic disease. Mounting evidence depict signs and symptoms involving multiple organs, most of which supported by pathological data. A plausible link to these manifestations is vascular and endothelial dysfunction/damage. However, much of the current knowledge relies on opinion and incipient evidence. We aim to objectively appraise current evidence on the association between COVID-19 and vascular disease, specifically endotheliitis and vasculitis. METHODS: Two researchers independently entered the search terms COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND vasculitis, endotheliitis OR endothelium in the following online platforms: MedRxiv and LitCovid (PubMed). The search period was set from November 1, 2019 to August 28, 2020. Manuscripts with unavailable full texts, not in English, mainly on pre-clinical data, presenting only study designs or not directly related to the topics of this review were excluded. Retrospective and prospective studies, especially longitudinal ones, were given priority to the purpose of this review. Since there was paucity of prospective controlled evidence, case reports/series were also considered. RESULTS: A total of 318 manuscripts were initially found. Sixty-seven (21%) were excluded: 59 (18.5%) met exclusion criteria and 8 (2.5%) were duplicates. One hundred and forty-two manuscripts (44,6%) did not provide original data and were also excluded: 35 (11%) were comments, 108 (33.9%) reviews; 1 (0.3%) position paper. One hundred and seven (33.6%) studies were considered for the present scoping review: 81 (25,5%) case reports/series; 18 (5.7%) prospective; 8 (2.5%) retrospective. Viral inclusions in endothelial cells, mononuclear cell infiltrates in the intima of small vessels and markers of endothelial cell apoptosis were demonstrated. Specificities of COVID-19 may lead to diverse vascular manifestations in different levels of the vascular bed. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence indicates that COVID-19 targets vasculature and endothelium. However, high quality data is still lacking and studies with prospective designs and appropriately matched controls are needed.","Quinaglia, Thiago; Shabani, Mahsima; Breder, Ikaro; Silber, Harry A; Lima, João A C; Sposito, Andrei C",Atherosclerosis,,34

Part of the cohort (age 25-65, well-educated) was collected directly during lockdown, to which retrospective cross-sectional data from and after lockdown (retrospective) questionnaires were added. We investigated sleep times and sleep quality changes from before to during lockdown and found that, during lockdown, participants had (i) worse perceived sleep quality if worried by COVID-19, (ii) a shift of bedtimes to later hours during workdays, and (iii) a sleep loss on free days (resulting from more overall sleep during workdays in non-system relevant jobs), leading to (iv) a marked reduction of social jetlag across all cultures. For further analyses we directly compared system relevant and system irrelevant jobs, because it was assumed that the nature of the lockdown's consequences is dependent upon system relevance. System relevant jobs were found to have earlier wake-up times as well as shorter total sleep times on workdays, leading to higher social jetlag for people in system relevant jobs. Cultural differences revealed a general effect that participants from Greece and Ukraine had later bedtimes (on both work and free days) and wake-up times (on workdays) than Cuba, Brazil and Austria, irrespective of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.","Florea, Cristina; Topalidis, Pavlos; Hauser, Theresa; Angerer, Monika; Kurapov, Anton; Beltran Leon, Carlos Alberto; Soares Brandão, Daniel; Schabus, Manuel",Biochem Pharmacol,,34

Drug combinations have been also tested to treat other infectious diseases, including the recentcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. To simplify administration fixed-dose combinationshave been introduced, however, oral anti-HIV therapy still struggles with low oral bioavailability of many ARVs.This work investigated the co-encapsulation of two clinically relevant ARV combinations,tipranavir (TPV):efavirenz (EFV) anddarunavir (DRV):efavirenz (EFV):ritonavir (RTV),within the core of ß-casein (bCN) micelles. Encapsulation efficiency in both systems was ~100%. Cryo-transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering of the ARV-loaded colloidaldispersions indicatefull preservation of the spherical morphology, and x-ray diffraction confirm that the encapsulated drugs are amorphous. To prolong the physicochemical stabilitythe formulations were freeze-driedwithout cryo/lyoprotectant, and successfully redispersed, with minor changes in morphology.Then, theARV-loaded micelles were encapsulated within microparticles of Eudragit® L100, which prevented enzymatic degradation and minimized drug release under gastric-like pH conditionsin vitro. At intestinal pH, the coating polymer dissolved and released the nanocarriers and content. Overall, our results confirm the promise of this flexible and modular technology platform for oral delivery of fixed dose combinations.","Singh Chauhan, Prakram; Abutbul Ionita, Inbal; Moshe Halamish, Hen; Sosnik, Alejandro; Danino, Dganit",J Colloid Interface Sci,,34

Laboratory findings have been only partially described in some observational studies. To date, more comprehensive systematic reviews of laboratory findings on COVID-19 are missing. We performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis to assess laboratory findings in patients with COVID-19. Observational studies from three databases were selected. We calculated pooled proportions and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using the random-effects model meta-analysis. A total of 1106 articles were identified from PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI (China), and other sources. After screening, 28 and 7 studies were selected for a systematic review and a meta-analysis, respectively. Of the 4,663 patients included, the most prevalent laboratory finding was increased C-reactive protein (CRP; 73.6%, 95% CI 65.0-81.3%), followed by decreased albumin (62.9%, 95% CI 28.3-91.2%), increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (61.2%, 95% CI 41.3-81.0%), decreased eosinophils (58.4%, 95% CI 46.5-69.8%), increased interleukin-6 (53.1%, 95% CI 36.0-70.0%), lymphopenia (47.9%, 95% CI 41.6-54.9%), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 46.2%, 95% CI 37.9-54.7%). A meta-analysis of seven studies with 1905 patients showed that increased CRP (OR 3.0, 95% CI: 2.1-4.4), lymphopenia (OR 4.5, 95% CI: 3.3-6.0), and increased LDH (OR 6.7, 95% CI: 2.4-18.9) were significantly associated with severity. These results demonstrated that more attention is warranted when interpreting laboratory findings in patients with COVID-19. Patients with elevated CRP levels, lymphopenia, or elevated LDH require proper management and, if necessary, transfer to the intensive care unit.","Zhang, Zu-Li; Hou, Yu-Lei; Li, De-Tao; Li, Feng-Zeng",Scand J Clin Lab Invest,,34

382745,The COVID-19 Pandemic and Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights in the Pacific,2021,"Purpose: To determine whether new pulmonary lesions will develop in COVID-19 patients with negative initial chest CT findings and to investigate their CT features and outcome during treatment. Patients and Methods: Data were collected retrospectively from 29 patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing but negative by initial chest CT from January 22 to February 17, 2020. Clinical manifestations, laboratory indicators, and follow-up CT data were evaluated. Results: Among 317 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 29 (9.1%) (mean ± SD, 38.5 ± 20.5 years; 12 women) with negative initial chest CT findings were evaluated. New pulmonary lesions developed in 10 (34.5%) patients on follow-up CT. Mean time from onset of new lesions to initial CT was 5.8 ± 3.0 days (range: 2-12 days). New lesions (mean involved lobes and segments: 2.5 ± 1.6 [range: 1-5] and 4.5 ± 4.5 [range: 1-13]) were mainly spherical/patchy ground-glass opacities frequently located in the left lower lobe (9, 90.0%). Among the 10 patients, lesions in 6 (60.0%) indicated progression after occurrence, and those in 10 (100.0%) indicated significant absorption on latest CT. When new lesions developed, 6 (60.0%) patients developed new symptoms or had aggravated symptoms and 3 (30.0%) had decreased lymphocyte count. Patients with worsening symptoms had higher involvement of lung segments (mean: 6.5 ± 5.0, range: 1-13) than asymptomatic patients (mean: 1.5 ± 0.6, range: 1-2) (P = 0.057). Conclusion: In COVID-19 patients with negative initial chest CT findings, new pulmonary lesions may develop during treatment. Repeat CT is necessary for monitoring the disease, especially when patients have worsening symptoms or laboratory indicators.","Fu, Binjie; Hu, Liangbo; Lv, Fajin; Huang, Junhao; Li, Wangjia; Ouyang, Yu; Chu, Zhigang",Infect Drug Resist,,34

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This paper includes three studies. The observational study reported the trends of blood collection during the epidemic in Guangzhou, China. The cross-sectional survey investigated factors influencing blood donation during the COVID-19 epidemic, and a self-administered questionnaire was given to 1584 street whole blood donors (SWBDs) who donated during the epidemic. The randomized controlled trial involved 19 491 SWBDs who donated in 2019 but did not donate during the epidemic. Trial participants were randomly assigned to two intervention groups: Group 1 completed Questionnaire 1, which contained precautionary measures in response to COVID-19 and other messages about blood donation during the epidemic; Group 2 completed Questionnaire 2, which did not include this information. A control group did not receive any questionnaire. RESULTS: As measures were implemented, the number of blood donors increased accordingly. Both first-time and repeat SWBDs perceived the same level of blood need and donated blood because it would save lives. SWBDs who completed Questionnaire 1 expressed a greater intention to donate during the epidemic. Enabling blood donors to perceive a higher level of blood need and a lower level of COVID-19 infection risk related to blood donation mobilized experienced SWBDs to donate within 3 weeks. Intention-to-treat analyses and average-treatment-effect-on-the-treated estimations confirmed that Questionnaire 1 could motivate SWBDs to actually donate blood. CONCLUSION: Various measures could ease blood shortage during the COVID-19 epidemic. Administration of Questionnaire 1 could increase blood donations during the epidemic.","Ou-Yang, Jian; Li, Shi-Jie; Bei, Chun-Hua; He, Bo; Chen, Jin-Yan; Liang, Hua-Qin; Fu, Yong-Shui",Transfusion,,34

The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 includes the entry into the target cells, replicase translation, replicating and transcribing genomes, translating structural proteins, assembling and releasing new virions. Entering host cells is a crucial stage in the early life cycle of the virus, and blocking this stage can effectively prevent virus infection. SARS enters the target cells mediated by the interaction between the viral S protein and the target cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as well as the cleavage effect of type-II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) on the S protein. Therefore, the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 are important targets for SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors. Herein, we provide a concise report/information on drugs with potential therapeutic value targeting virus-ACE2 or virus-TMPRSS2 interactions, to provide a reference for the design and discovery of potential entry inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.","Lin, Hao; Cherukupalli, Srinivasulu; Feng, Da; Gao, Shenghua; Kang, Dongwei; Zhan, Peng; Liu, Xinyong",Curr. med. chem,,34

386916,Multi-Level Governance of COVID-19 Pandemic and the Solitude Within Geriatric Oncology,2021,"Since January 2020, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected the whole world, producing a respiratory disease that can become severe and even cause death in certain groups of people. The main method for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is performing viral tests. However, the kits for carrying out these tests are scarce in certain regions of the world. Lung conditions as perceived in computed tomography and radiography images exhibit a high correlation with the presence of COVID-19 infections. This work attempted to assess the feasibility of using convolutional neural networks for the analysis of pulmonary radiography images to distinguish COVID-19 infections from non-infected cases and other types of viral or bacterial pulmonary conditions. The results obtained indicate that these networks can successfully distinguish the pulmonary radiographies of COVID-19-infected patients from radiographies that exhibit other or no pathology, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97.6%. This could help future efforts to automate the process of identifying lung radiography images of suspicious cases, thereby supporting medical personnel when many patients need to be rapidly checked. The automated analysis of pulmonary radiography is not intended to be a substitute for formal viral tests or formal diagnosis by a properly trained physician but rather to assist with identification when the need arises.","Alorf, Abdulaziz",Algorithms,,34

388112,Marching toward Coverage: How Women Can Lead the Fight for Universal Healthcare,2020,"Prions are often considered as anomalous proteins associated primarily with disease rather than as a fundamental source of diversity within biological proteomes. Whereas this longstanding viewpoint has its genesis in the discovery of the original namesake prions as causative agents of several complex diseases, the underlying assumption of a strict disease basis for prions could not be further from the truth. Prions and the spectrum of functions they comprise, likely represent one of the largest paradigm shifts concerning molecular-encoded phenotypic diversity since identification of DNA as the principle molecule of heredity. The ability of prions to recruit similar proteins to alternate conformations may engender a reservoir of diversity supplementing the genetic diversity resulting from stochastic mutations of DNA and subsequent natural selection. Here we present several currently known prions and how many of their functions as well as modes of transmission are intricately linked to adaptation from an evolutionary perspective. Further, the stability of some prion conformations across generations indicates that heritable prion-based adaptation is a reality.","Dixson, Jamie D; Azad, Rajeev K",J. mol. evol,,34

393290,"Computers, confounding, clusters, consent, cost, COVID and consultation: how the Health and Disability Code impedes the learning health system",2020,"Background: Traditionally, outpatient visits for those with chronic liver disease (CLD) have been delivered in-person with the patient traveling to a centralized location to see the health care provider. The use of virtual care in health care delivery has been gaining popularity across a variety of patient populations, especially within the COVID-19 context. Performed before COVID-19, the aim of the present study was to explore the perspectives of patients with CLD toward the use of virtual care with their liver specialists. Methods: A cross-sectional, mixed methods study was used to conduct this work. Results: A total of 101 patients with CLD participated in this study. Participants had a mean age of 54.5 years (range 19-87 years). Quantitative analysis revealed that 86% were willing to attend a virtual visit with their liver specialist in the future. There was a significant relationship between both age and income level and acceptance of virtual care. The themes emerging from the qualitative analysis included: (1) past experiences attending in-person visits, (2) perspectives on the use of virtual visits, and (3) perceived challenges of virtual visits. Conclusions: Although there are many potential benefits of virtual care to both the patient and the health care system, there are instances (older age, low income level) when in-person care may be preferred by patients. A tailored approach that is mindful of the individual patient's health status, ease of access to technology, and preferences must be considered when offering virtual care. These findings are of particular relevance during COVID-19, an era that has forced us into the virtual space.","Hyde, Ashley M; Watt, Makayla; Carbonneau, Michelle; Eboreime, Ejemai Amaize; Abraldes, Juan G; Tandon, Puneeta",Telemed. j. e. health,,34

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a mini-review. Due to the similarity between the COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, we searched for the following keywords: ""SARS-CoV, male reproductive system, infertility, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and orchitis"". By reviewing and analyzing the literature, we analyzed the influence of temperature on sperm, the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the testes, and the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the male reproductive system. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 enters the body through the ACE2 receptor. The high expression of ACE2 on the surface of spermatogonia and supporting cells in the testes, as well as the immune response caused by COVID-19, can lead to testicular spermatogenesis dysfunction and reduced sperm count. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection can affect male reproductive function, and standard treatment strategies should be established in time to help male patients infected with COVID-19.","Meng, T-T; Dong, R-J; Li, T-G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,34
395351,"[Physical and sports activities, management of the COVID-19 pandemic, Segur for health and Segur for public health: For a winning trinomial]",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has killed millions of people worldwide since its outbreak in December 2019. The pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus whose main protease (Mpro) is a promising drug target since it plays a key role in viral proliferation and replication. Currently, developing an effective therapy is an urgent task, which requires accurately estimating the ligand-binding free energy to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. However, it should be noted that the accuracy of a free energy method probably depends on the protein target. A highly accurate approach for some targets may fail to produce a reasonable correlation with the experiment when a novel enzyme is considered as a drug target. Therefore, in this context, the ligand-binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was calculated via various approaches. The molecular docking approach was manipulated using Autodock Vina (Vina) and Autodock4 (AD4) protocols to preliminarily investigate the ligand-binding affinity and pose to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The binding free energy was then refined using the fast pulling of ligand (FPL), linear interaction energy (LIE), molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA), and free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. The benchmark results indicated that for docking calculations, Vina is more accurate than AD4, and for free energy methods, FEP is the most accurate method, followed by LIE, FPL, and MM-PBSA (FEP > LIE &#8776; FPL > MM-PBSA). Moreover, atomistic simulations revealed that the van der Waals interaction is the dominant factor. The residues Thr26, His41, Ser46, Asn142, Gly143, Cys145, His164, Glu166, and Gln189 are essential elements affecting the binding process. Our benchmark provides guidelines for further investigations using computational approaches.","Ngo, Son Tung; Tam, Nguyen Minh; Pham, Minh Quan; Nguyen, Trung Hai",J Chem Inf Model,,34

METHODS: This cohort study was conducted at University Hospital, which is a designated hospital for COVID-19 patients. Adult patients who were admitted to our hospital emergency department with suspected COVID-19 and who were hospitalized in our institution with a COVID-19 diagnosis were analysed. RESULTS: There were 148 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. All-cause mortality of follow-up was 12.8%. There were statistically significant results between the two groups (survivors and nonsurvivors), which were classified based on hospital mortality rates, in terms of the lymphocyte to C-reactive protein ratio (LCRP), systemic immune inflammation index (SII), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), CRP concentration and comorbid disease. In a receiver operating characteristic (ROC), curve analysis, LCRP, NLR, PLR and SII area under the curve (AUC) for in-hospital mortality were 0.817, 0.816, 0.733 and 0.742, respectively. Based on an LCRP value of 1 for in-hospital mortality, the sensitivity and specificity rates were 100% and 86.8%, respectively. Based on the average SII of 2699 for in-hospital mortality, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy rates were 68.4%, 77.5% and 76.3%, respectively. A total of 19 patients died during hospitalization. All of these patients had an LCRP level &#8804; 1; 14 had an NLR level &#8804; 10.8; 13 had an SII &#8805; 2699 (Fisher's exact test, P = .000). Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality rates were LCRP < 1, PLR, SII &#8805; 2699, white blood cell count, CRP, age, comorbidities, and ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that inflammatory parameters, such as LRCP, SII and NLR, were associated with disease severity and could be used as potentially important risk factors for COVID-19 progression.","Acar, Ethem; Demir, Ahmet; Yildirim, Birdal; Kaya, Mehmet Gökhan; Gökçek, Kemal",Int J Clin Pract,,34

We are interested to understand how Singapore's cancer-SSAs utilized the social media platform Facebook to overcome the restrictions which were introduced due to COVID-19. Facebook posts from two prominent cancer-SSAs 365 Cancer Prevention Society (365CPS) and Singapore Cancer Society (SCS) between comparable periods in 2019 and 2020 were extracted. These posts were categorized using a classification scheme which was specifically developed by two coders with adequate intercoder reliability. Statistical analyses were performed to determine if there was a significant difference in the frequency of posts between 2019 and 2020, and across three specific periods in 2020. Results indicate that 365CPS appears to have adapted to the pandemic by increasing their posting frequency on Facebook in 2020, but the same was not evident for SCS. However, both SSAs tweaked their social media outreach strategy in line with social distancing measures, publishing posts detailing activities that beneficiaries can participate from home such as healthy recipes and virtual events. SSAs can scale up their efforts to achieve a higher level of health promotion and support for their beneficiaries. Further qualitative studies are required to ascertain the impact of COVID-19 from the perspective of beneficiaries and validate the classification scheme which was developed in this study. The classification scheme could be used in ascertaining the quality of social media communication between public/private support groups and patients.","Ethan Tan, Kieran; Sesagiri Raamkumar, Aravind; Wee, Hwee Lin",J Biomed Inform,,34

No previous study has assessed this issue; Methods: An online survey was given to an opportunistic sample of Italian MSM. The questionnaire investigated sexual behaviour and habits, HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) knowledge and PrEP awareness, attitudes and practices. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to identify factors associated with PrEP knowledge; Results: A total of 196 MSM participated in this survey. Overall data showed that 87.2% of participants knew what PrEP is, but only 7.5% have ever used it. The main reason for not using PrEP was the cost of the therapy (26.9%). The principal source of PrEP information was the Internet (68.4%). Being regularly tested for HIV was significantly associated with PrEP knowledge (adjusted odds ratio (AdjOR) = 3.16; confidence interval (CI) = 1.06-9.29); Conclusions: Knowledge regarding PrEP was well established, but PrEP use was not equally widespread.

In three studies from the United States (N = 220; N = 288) and the UK (N = 298), we went beyond this focus on a general conspiracy worldview and tested the idea that different forms of conspiracy beliefs despite being positively correlated have distinct behavioral implications. Whereas conspiracy beliefs describing the pandemic as a hoax were more strongly associated with reduced containment-related behavior, conspiracy beliefs about sinister forces purposefully creating the virus related to an increase in self-centered prepping behavior.","Imhoff, Roland; Lamberty, Pia",Soc.

403623,Personal reflections on navigating the COVID-19 pandemic: From vision to reality,2021,"BACKGROUND: Orofacial cleft, one of the most common congenital deformities, presents with a plethora of defects, subjecting the patient to a multitude of treatments from a young age. Among the oral hard tissue problems, absence of a maxillary permanent tooth in the cleft region either due to congenital absence or extraction due to compromised prognosis is a common finding. Conventionally, the missing tooth is replaced using a removable or fixed partial denture; however, the treatment modality does not satisfactorily meet patient expectations. The most recent decade has seen increasing use of dental implants in the cleft region; however, the outcome of an immediately loaded dental implant is still elusive for orofacial cleft patients. OBJECTIVE: This protocol is for a single-arm clinical trial aimed at determining the treatment outcome of immediately loaded dental implants in patients with a nonsyndromic orofacial cleft. METHODS: Patients meeting the set criteria will be sequentially enrolled until a sample size of 30 dental implants is met and will undergo the proposed treatment according to the predecided protocol. All patients will be followed up at the designated time intervals to record various clinical and radiographic parameters. Implant success will be defined based on the criteria elucidated by Misch et al in the Pisa, Italy Consensus. A quality-of-life assessment questionnaire will also be recorded at the end of patient's follow-up to determine their acceptance of the treatment. RESULTS: A total of 30 dental implants will be placed in patients with a nonsyndromic orofacial cleft. Obtained results will be statistically analyzed to determine the treatment outcomes and success. CONCLUSIONS: This study will help determine the feasibility of immediately loaded dental implants in compromised bone sites such as those presented in cleft patients and will help in generating findings that can be used to fill the lacunae currently present in the holistic treatment of cleft patients.

METHOD: The sample consisted of 943 healthy individuals and 163 patients (respiratory, autoimmune, cardiovascular, endocrine, patients with other diseases, and patients with more than one disease) completing sociodemographic assessments as well as the 4-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ) during March 30, 2020 to May 3, 2020. Pearson's correlation was used to search for the association between time spent on quarantine and the 4DSQ subscales (distress, anxiety, depression, and somatization). Independent sample T-test and Glass's &#916; were used for differences between healthy individuals and chronic disease patients in these subscales, an analysis also carried out between healthy individuals and all patient subgroups. RESULTS: No statistically significant correlations were noted between the 4DSQ subscales and the quarantine duration, both for the patient and the healthy individuals' group. Chronic disease patients had significantly higher levels of distress (p = 0.001, &#916; = 0.28) and somatization (p = 0.000, &#916; = 0.47), but not there were no significant differences in anxiety (p = 0.098, &#916; = 0.14) and depression (p = 0.052, &#916; = 0.19). Concerning head-to-head comparisons between the healthy individuals' group and each patient group, significantly higher scores in distress were found only for patients with respiratory diseases (p = 0.028, &#916; = 0.42). Regarding somatization, significantly higher scores were noted for the healthy individuals' group compared with patients with autoimmune diseases (p = 0.010, &#916; = 0.62), respiratory diseases (p = 0.027, &#916; = 0.42), other diseases (p = 0.003, &#916; = 0.55), and more than one disease (p = 0.012, &#916; = 0.60). No statistically significant differences were found in anxiety and depression. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The results of this study indicate that interventional programs for chronic disease patients during quarantine should focus on distress and somatization, not on anxiety and depression.

A subgroup of patients was followed up for 2-4 weeks to evaluate the short-term outcome of renal impairment. Results: Overall, 168 COVID-19-positive patients were included in the study. The majority of patients (79.7%) were diagnosed with mild or moderate disease. Half of patients presented with fever; however, in The Tibetan cohort, fever only occurred in 13.4% of patients. On hospital admission, proteinuria and dipstick hematuria were noted in 18.4% and 17.4% of patients, respectively, while AKI only occurred in one patient. Further analysis showed that severe or critical COVID-19 was associated with higher risk of proteinuria [relative risk (RR) 7.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.45-22.18, P = 3.8 × 10-4] and dipstick hematuria (RR 8.30, 95% CI 2.69-25.56, P = 2.3 × 10-4). Proteinuria, dipstick hematuria, or the combination of proteinuria and hematuria could significantly predict severe or critical severe COVID-19. Conclusions: Proteinuria and dipstick hematuria are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19 infection, especially in severe or critical cases.","Hong, Daqing; Long, Lin; Wang, Amanda Y; Lei, Yu; Tang, Yun; Zhao, Jia Wei; Song, Xiaofei; He, Yanan; Wen, Ergang; Zheng, Ling; Li, Guisen; Wang, Li",Clin Kidney J,,34
406921,"Health literacy and disparities in COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviours in Australia",2020,"The renin-angiotensin system is of vital significance not only in the maintenance of blood pressure but also because of its role in the pathophysiology of different organ systems in the body. Of the 2 Ang II (angiotensin II) receptors, the AT1R (Ang II type 1 receptor) has been extensively studied for its role in mediating the classical functions of Ang II, including vasoconstriction, stimulation of renal tubular sodium reabsorption, hormonal secretion, cell proliferation, inflammation, and oxidative stress. The other receptor, AT2R (Ang II type 2 receptor), is abundantly expressed in both immune and nonimmune cells in fetal tissue. However, its expression is increased under pathological conditions in adult tissues. The role of AT2R in counteracting AT1R function has been discussed in the past 2 decades. However, with the discovery of the nonpeptide agonist C21, the significance of AT2R in various pathologies such as obesity, hypertension, and kidney diseases have been examined. This review focuses on the most recent findings on the beneficial effects of AT2R by summarizing both gene knockout studies as well as pharmacological studies, specifically highlighting its importance in blood pressure regulation, obesity/metabolism, organ protection, and relevance in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Fatima, Naureen; Patel, Sanket N; Hussain, Tahir",Hypertension,,34

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health in Indianapolis in the early weeks of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. PATIENTS: All hospitalized pediatric patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 as of May 4, 2020, were included. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received therapies including hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, tocilizumab, and convalescent serum and were managed according to an institutional algorithm based on evidence available at the time of presentation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 407 children tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 at our hospital, 24 were positive, and 19 required hospitalization. Seven (36.8%) were critically ill in ICU, and four (21%) required mechanical ventilation. Hospitalized children were predominantly male (14, 74%) and African-American or Hispanic (14, 74%), with a bimodal distribution of ages among young children less than or equal to 2 years old (8, 42%) and older adolescents ages 15-18 (6, 32%). Five of seven (71.4%) of critically ill patients were African-American (n = 3) or Hispanic (n = 2). Critical illness was associated with older age (p = 0.017), longer duration of symptoms (p = 0.036), and lower oxygen saturation on presentation (p = 0.016); with more thrombocytopenia (p = 0.015); higher C-reactive protein (p = 0.031); and lower WBC count (p = 0.039). Duration of mechanical ventilation averaged 14.1 days. One patient died. CONCLUSIONS: Severe, protracted coronavirus disease 2019 is seen in pediatric patients, including those without significant comorbidities. We observed a greater proportion of hospitalized children requiring mechanical ventilation than has been reported to date. Older children, African-American or Hispanic children, and males may be at risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 requiring hospitalization. Hypoxia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated C-reactive protein may be useful markers of critical illness. Data regarding optimal management and therapies for pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 are urgently needed.","Bhumbra, Samina; Malin, Stefan; Kirkpatrick, Lindsey; Khaitan, Alka; John, Chandy C; Rowan, Courtney M; Enane, Leslie A",Pediatr Crit Care Med,,34

We investigated psychological reactions and insomnia during the COVID-19 outbreak in adults with mental health disorders (MDs). METHODS: A self-reported psychological and sleep online survey was conducted in China between February 5th to 19th, 2020. A total of 244 adults with MDs and 1116 controls matched for age, gender and sites were included. Worsened symptoms of anxiety, depressive and insomnia were defined when severity levels shifted to a more severe category compared to pre-COVID-19. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, we found significantly increased prevalence of anxiety (MDs: 54.9% vs. 49.6%, controls: 25.5% vs. 14.3%), depression (MDs: 63.9% vs. 61.5%, controls: 29.9% vs. 21.2%) and insomnia (MDs: 66.0% vs. 57.8%, controls: 31.5% vs. 24.8%) compared to pre-COVID-19 period (all P-value < 0.001). Furthermore, adults with MDs had higher odds for developing COVID-19-related stress (OR = 3.41, 95% CI 2.49 ~ 4.67), worsened anxiety (OR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.38 ~ 2.76), depression (OR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.43 ~ 2.93) and insomnia (OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.53 ~ 3.21) during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to controls. Moreover, higher COVID-19-related stress and lower levels of pre-COVID-19 anxiety, depressive and insomnia symptoms were predictors for worsened anxiety, depression and insomnia in adults with MDs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that adverse psychological reactions and insomnia are more pronounced in adults with mental health disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak, thus more attention need to be provided.","Sun, Qimeng; Qin, Qingsong; Basta, Maria; Chen, Baixin; Li, Yun",BMC Psychiatry,,34

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The chest CT images of 64 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who were RT-PCR test-positive but asymptomatic were retrospectively evaluated for the appearance and distribution of abnormal parenchymal findings. RESULTS: Of the 64 patients (mean age 59.4 ± 12; range 23-85), 42 (65%) were female, and 22 (35%) were male, and 16 (25%) of the patients had no abnormal findings on chest CT. Of the remaining 48 patients, lung involvement was bilateral in 32 (67%). Right upper lobe in 26 (54%), right middle lobe in 20 (42%), right lower lobe in 38 (79%), left upper lobe in 27 (56%), and left lower lobe were affected in 34 (71%) patients. The mean number of opacities detected in patients was 7.5 ± 5.7. The opacities were located only peripherally/subpleural in 22 (46%), only centrally/peribronchovascular in 5 (10%), and mixed in 21 (44%) patients. The frequency of pure ground glass opacities (GGO) was 63% GGO with a crazy-paving pattern or consolidation was 33%. Pure consolidation was detected in only two (4%) patients. Parenchymal opacities were only round in 27 (56%), only geographic demarcated in 3 (6%), only patchy in 2 (4%), and mixed in 16 (33%) patients. CONCLUSION: Chest CT was normal in only one-quarter of the asymptomatic patients. CT findings in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients were often peripherally located, mostly round-shaped GGO.","Uysal, Emine; Kilinçer, Abidin; Cebeci, Hakan; Özer, Halil; Demir, Nazlim Aktug; Öztürk, Mehmet; Koplay, Mustafa",Clin Imaging,,34

Materials and Methods: Chitosan NPs were prepared and characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and zeta potential measurement. MSCs CM were prepared and entrapped into MSCs CM-CS NPs composite and its release efficiency was measured. Antibacterial efficacy of nano structures was determined by disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods. Antibiofilm activity was assessed by crystal violet assay. Results: BM-MSCs were characterized to be negative for CD34 and CD45 markers, positive for CD73 and CD44 markers, and able to differentiate into osteoblast and adipocyte cells. The mean particle size of 96.6% of chitosan NPs was 414.9 nm with a suitable zeta potential and SEM morphology. Entrapment efficiency of MSCs CM-CS NPs was 76.9%. Unstimulated MSCs CM-CS NPs composite as a novel and proficient therapeutic nanostructure against MDR V. cholerae strains showed the synergistic activity of the two components of MSCs CM and CS NPs, leading to greater bacterial killing compared to control groups. MSCs CM more efficiently inhibited biofilm formation, although MSCs CM-CS NPs was also appeared to be effective in inhibiting biofilm formation compared to CS NPs and control group. Conclusion: The designed nanodrug composite showed the best release in conditions mimicking the physiological conditions of the intestinal lumen. Given the fact that no overuse or genetic event would cause the emergence of antimicrobial resistance against the MSCs CM-CS NPs nanodrug, it could be considered as a promising alternative for the treatment of MDR V. cholerae infections in clinical settings.","Saberpour, Masoumeh; Bakhshi, Bita; Najar-Peerayeh, Shahin",Infect Drug Resist,,34

One important measure is the so-called physical distancing or social distancing. In this paper, we propose an agent-based numerical simulation of pedestrian dynamics in order to assess behaviour of pedestrians in public places in the context of contact-transmission of infectious diseases like COVID-19, and to gather insights about exposure times and the overall effectiveness of distancing measures. To abide the minimum distance of $1.5m$ stipulated by the German government at an infection rate of 2%, our simulation results suggest that a density of one person per $16m^2$ or below is sufficient.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe the degree of myocardial injury and associated outcomes in a large hospitalized cohort with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 admitted to 1 of 5 Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York City between February 27, 2020, and April 12, 2020, with troponin-I (normal value <0.03 ng/ml) measured within 24 h of admission were included (n = 2,736). Demographics, medical histories, admission laboratory results, and outcomes were captured from the hospitals' electronic health records. RESULTS: The median age was 66.4 years, with 59.6% men. Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, was more prevalent in patients with higher troponin concentrations, as were hypertension and diabetes. A total of 506 (18.5%) patients died during hospitalization. In all, 985 (36%) patients had elevated troponin concentrations. After adjusting for disease severity and relevant clinical factors, even small amounts of myocardial injury (e.g., troponin I >0.03 to 0.09 ng/ml; n = 455; 16.6%) were significantly associated with death (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.37 to 2.24; p < 0.001) while greater amounts (e.g., troponin I >0.09 ng/dl; n = 530; 19.4%) were significantly associated with higher risk (adjusted HR: 3.03; 95% CI: 2.42 to 3.80; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial injury is prevalent among patients hospitalized with COVID-19; however, troponin concentrations were generally present at low levels. Patients with CVD are more likely to have myocardial injury than patients without CVD.

The objectives of this systematic review was to determine the GI manifestations of pediatric COVID-19 and to evaluate their role as risk factors for a severe clinical course. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed and Scopus for studies published before December 31, 2020 with information about the GI manifestations of pediatric COVID-19. Patients with a severe and non-severe clinical course were compared using the inverse variance heterogeneity model and odds ratio (OR) as the effect size. A sensitivity analysis was performed if the heterogeneity was high among studies. RESULTS: A total of 811 studies were identified through systematic search of which 55 studies (4369 patients) were included in this systematic review. The commonest GI symptoms were diarrhea-19.08%(95%CI : 10.6-28.2), nausea/vomiting 19.7%(95%CI : 7.8-33.2) and abdominal pain 20.3%(95%CI : 3.7-40.4).

Healthcare has struggled to embrace systems safety approaches, mis-applied or misinterpreted others, and has stuck to a range of outdated and potentially counter-productive myths even has safety science has developed. One consequence of these persistent misunderstandings is that few opportunities exist in clinical settings for qualified HF professionals. Instead, HF has been applied by clinicians and others, to highly variable degrees - sometimes great success, but frequently in limited and sometimes counter-productive ways. Meanwhile, HF professionals have struggled to make a meaningful impact on frontline care and have had little career structure or support. However, In the last few years, embedded clinical HF practitioners have begun to have considerable success that are now being supported and amplified by professional networks. The recent COVID-19 experiences confirm this. Closer collaboration between healthcare and HF professionals will result in significant and ultimately beneficial changes to both professions and to clinical care.","Catchpole, Ken; Bowie, Paul; Fouquet, Sarah; Rivera, Joy; Hignett, Sue",Int. j. qual. health care,,34

RESULTS: The prevalence of CAPA varied between 0 and 33%, which may be partly due to variable case definitions, but likely represents true variation. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) remain the cornerstone of CAPA diagnosis, allowing for diagnosis of invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis and collection of the best validated specimen for Aspergillus diagnostics. Most patients diagnosed with CAPA lack traditional host factors, but pre-existing structural lung disease and immunomodulating therapy may predispose to CAPA risk. Computed tomography seems to be of limited value to rule CAPA in or out, and serum biomarkers are negative in 85% of patients. As the mortality of CAPA is around 50%, antifungal therapy is recommended for BAL positive patients, but the decision to treat depends on the patients' clinical condition and the institutional incidence of CAPA. We recommend against routinely stopping concomitant corticosteroid or IL-6 blocking therapy in CAPA patients. CONCLUSION: CAPA is a complex disease involving a continuum of respiratory colonization, tissue invasion and angioinvasive disease. Knowledge gaps including true epidemiology, optimal diagnostic work-up, management strategies and role of host-directed therapy require further study.","Verweij, Paul E; Brüggemann, Roger J M; Azoulay, Elie; Bassetti, Matteo; Blot, Stijn; Buil, Jochem B; Calandra, Thierry; Chiller, Tom; Clancy, Cornelius J; Cornely, Oliver A; Depuydt, Pieter; Koehler, Philipp; Lagrou, Katrien; de Lange, Dylan; Lass-Flörl, Cornelia; Lewis, Russell E; Lortholary, Olivier; Liu, Peter-Wei Lun; Maertens, Johan; Nguyen, M Hong; Patterson, Thomas F; Rijnders, Bart J A; Rodriguez, Alejandro; Rogers, Thomas R; Schouten, Jeroen A; Wauters, Joost; van de Veerdonk, Frank L; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio",Intensive Care Med,,34
424407,When informal work and poor work conditions backfire and fuel the COVID-19 pandemic: Why we should listen to the lessons from Latin America,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID crisis hit during the interview season for the Complex General Surgical Oncology (CGSO) fellowship. With minimal time to adapt, all programs transitioned to virtual interviews. Here we describe the experience of both program directors (PDs) and candidates with virtual interviews, and provide guidelines for implementation based on the results. METHODS: Surveys regarding interview day specifics and perceptions were created for CGSO fellowship PDs and candidates. They were distributed at the conclusion of the season, prior to match. RESULTS: Thirty (94%) PDs and 64 (79%) candidates responded. Eighty-three% of PDs and 79% of candidates agreed or strongly agreed that they felt comfortable creating a rank list. If given the choice, 60% of PDs and 45% of candidates would choose virtual interviews over in-person interviews. The majority of candidates found PD overviews, fellows only sessions and pre-interview materials helpful. CONCLUSION: Overall, the majority of PDs and candidates felt comfortable creating a rank list; however, more PDs preferred virtual interviews for the future. Our results also confirm key components of a virtual interview day.","Hill, Maureen V; Ross, Eric A; Crawford, Derrick; Lai, Lily; Turaga, Kiran; Grubbs, Elizabeth G; Mullen, John; Dineen, Sean; D039,; Angelica, Michael; Reddy, Sanjay; Farma, Jeffrey M",Am. j. surg,,34
426207,Creating a Scalable Physical Activity Breaks Resource Through the Multisensory Multilevel Health Education Model: H.Y.P.E. The Breaks!,2021,"The recently identified SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered the age-associated vulnerability in the burden of disease and put aging research in the spotlight. The limited data available indicates that COVID-19 should be referred to as a gerolavic (from Greek, géros ""old man"" and epilavís, ""harmful"") infection because the infection rates, severity, and lethality are substantially higher in the population aged 60 and older. This is primarily due to comorbidity but may be partially due to immunosenescence, decreased immune function in the elderly, and general loss of function, fitness, and increased frailty associated with aging. Immunosenescence is a major factor affecting vaccination response, as well as the severity and lethality of infectious diseases. While vaccination reduces infection rates, and therapeutic interventions reduce the severity and lethality of infections, these interventions have limitations. Previous studies showed that postulated geroprotectors, such as sirolimus (rapamycin) and its close derivative rapalog everolimus (RAD001), decreased infection rates in a small sample of elderly patients. This article presents a review of the limited literature available on geroprotective and senoremediative interventions that may be investigated to decrease the disease burden of gerolavic infections. This article also highlights a need for rigorous clinical validation of deep aging clocks as surrogate markers of biological age. These could be used to assess the need for, and efficacy of, geroprotective and senoremediative interventions and provide better protection for elderly populations from gerolavic infections. This article does not represent medical advice and the medications described are not yet licensed or recommended as immune system boosters, as they have not undergone clinical evaluation for this purpose.","Zhavoronkov, Alex",Aging (Albany NY),,34
426629,The single most important lesson from COVID-19 - It is time to take public health seriously,2021,"BACKGROUND: Acrochordons are benign hypertrophic lesions of the skin of which the pathophysiology is unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the association of acrochordons with autoimmune disorders in patients with a poor obstetric history. METHODS: This retrospective cohort involved 350 female patients with poor obstetric history who were included in a preconceptional care program to investigate risk factors for obstetric complications. These patients were further investigated for the co-existence of autoimmune disorders (defined by either a diagnosis of autoimmune diseases or autoimmune antibody positivity) and acrochordons. RESULTS: An autoimmune disorder was present in 55.7% (195/350) of the patients. The rate of acrochordons was significantly higher in patients with autoimmune disorders (n= 195) compared to the control group (n= 155) (8.21% versus 2.58%, respectively) (p= 0.043). When the autoimmune disease positive (n= 58) and autoimmune antibody-positive (n= 137) groups were separately analyzed, acrochordons were found more frequently in the autoimmune disease group (p= 0.004). However, there was no statistically significant co-occurrence of autoimmune antibody positivity and the presence of skin tags (p= 0.135). CONCLUSION: There may be immune system-related biological mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of acrochordons. Preconceptional counseling is beneficial for women with poor obstetric history and acrochordons.","Beksac, Burcu; Donmez, Hanife Guler; Cagan, Murat; Unal, Canan; Fadiloglu, Erdem; Beksac, Mehmet Sinan",Hum. antibodies,,34

428553,MITS: an interim step towards improved cause of death data,2020,"Respiratory droplets exhaled during speaking, coughing or sneezing have been responsible for the spread of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The droplet dynamics depend on the surrounding air velocity, temperature and relative humidity. Droplets evaporate to form aerosols that contain the disease spreading virus. In a confined space like an elevator, the risk of transmission becomes higher when there is an infected person inside the elevator with other individuals. In this work, a numerical study is carried out in a 3D domain resembling an elevator using OpenFoam. Different modes of air ventilation are considered inside the elevator and the impact of these air circulations on droplet dynamics is investigated. The scenario of the opening of the elevator door and the passenger leaving the elevator has also been considered in order to simulate a real-life condition. A pedantic analysis of certain risk assessment factors and remedial measures to be adopted has been performed which include the number of aerosols present in the zone of 0.8 to 1.8 m, the radial spread of the suspended droplets around the mouth of the infected person. From these factors, the safe condition can be understood. The time period up to which the elevator will be risk-prone has also been investigated in case the person coughs just before leaving the elevator. After conducting these studies, the quiescent environment has been found out to be the most dangerous whereas ventilation with an exhaust fan is the safest.","Biswas, Riddhideep; Pal, Anish; Pal, Ritam; Sarkar, Sourav; Mukhopadhyay, Achintya",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12841v1.pdf,34

Fifteen wheelchair tennis and 15 able-bodied tennis players enrolled. Electromagnetic system and trial-axial accelerometers were used to measure the difference in the kinematic parameters of the upper extremity and the impact vibration transferred across the wrist joint. The results indicated that wheelchair players demonstrated unique elbow and wrist kinematics, especially shorter total swing time, greater elbow flexion at preparation, lower wrist extension acceleration before impact, and smaller racket vibration at impact. Comparing to able-bodied players in standing, wheelchair players and players in sitting demonstrated significantly greater elbow joint flexion/extension angle, angular velocity, angular acceleration during extension, and wrist joint flexion angle. Wheelchair players also differ significantly with the players in sitting regarding elbow joint angular velocity and acceleration, and wrist joint flexion velocity. These adaptations and adjustments can be attributed to the missing lower extremity function and deficient trunk kinetic chain. The differences between wheelchair tennis players and able-bodied players in sitting could represent the progress as the wheelchair players moving from novices to experts.","Ju, Yan-Ying; Chu, Wan-Ting; Shieh, Wann-Yun; Cheng, Hsin-Yi Kathy",Sports Biomech,,34

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends oxygenation through high-flow nasal cannula over non-invasive ventilation. The primary outcome of our study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of a surgical mask on a high-flow nasal cannula system on oxygenation parameters in hypoxemic COVID-19 patients admitted in ICU who do not require urgent intubation. The secondary outcomes were relevant changes in PaCO2 associated with clinical modifications and patient's feelings. DESIGN: We prospectively assessed 21 patients admitted in our mixed Intensive Care Unit of the Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc. MAIN RESULTS: While FiO2 was unchanged, we demonstrate a significant increase of PaO2 (from 59 (± 6), to 79 mmHg (± 16), p < 0.001), PaO2/FiO2 from 83 (± 22), to 111 (± 38), p < 0.001) and SaO2 (from 91% (± 1.5), to 94% (± 1.6), p < 0.001), while the patients were under the surgical mask. The SpO2 returned to pre-treatment values when the surgical mask was removed confirming the effect of the device rather than a spontaneous positive evolution. CONCLUSION: A surgical mask placed on patient's face already treated by a High-flow nasal cannula device improves COVID-19 patient's oxygenation admitted in Intensive Care Unit for severe hypoxemic respiratory failure without any clinically relevant side.","Montiel, Virginie; Robert, Arnaud; Robert, Annie; Nabaoui, Anas; Marie, Tourneux; Mestre, Natalia Morales; Guillaume, Maerckx; Laterre, Pierre-François; Wittebole, Xavier",Ann Intensive Care,,34

443370,Socio-psychological impact on Bangladeshi students during COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly emerging Coronavirus that was first identified in 2012 in Hong Kong, China. Since then, PDCoV has subsequently been reported worldwide, causing a high number of neonatal piglet deaths and significant economic losses to the swine industry. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a highly sensitive and specific method for the rapid diagnosis of PDCoV. RESULTS: In the present study, a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic method using recombinase polymerase amplification combined with a lateral flow dipstick (LFD-RPA) was developed for rapid and visual detection of PDCoV. The system can be performed under a broad range of temperature conditions from 10 to 37 °C, and the detection of PDCoV can be completed in 10 min at 37 °C. The sensitivity of this assay was 10 times higher than that of conventional PCR with a lower detection limit of 1 × 102 copies/µl of PDCoV. Meanwhile, the LFD-RPA assay specifically amplified PDCoV, while there was no cross-amplification with other swine-associated viruses, including Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), Porcine kobuvirus (PKoV), Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and Seneca valley virus (SVV). The repeatability of the test results indicated that this assay had good repeatability. In addition, 68 clinical samples (48 fecal swab specimens and 20 intestinal specimens) were further tested by LFD-RPA and RT-PCR assay. The positive rate of LFD-RPA clinical samples was 26.47% higher than that of conventional PCR (23.53%). CONCLUSIONS: The LFD-RPA assay successfully detected PDCoV in less than 20 min in this study, providing a potentially valuable tool to improve molecular detection for PDCoV and to monitor the outbreak of PDCoV, especially in low-resource areas and laboratories.","Gao, Xiang; Liu, Xinsheng; Zhang, Yongguang; Wei, Yanming; Wang, Yonglu",BMC Vet Res,,34

However, the development of a large-area nTP process has been hampered by critical reliability issues related to the uniform replication and regular transfer printing of functional nanomaterials. Here, we present a very practical thermally assisted nanotransfer printing (T-nTP) process that can easily produce well-ordered nanostructures on an 8-inch wafer via the use of a heat-rolling press system that provides both uniform pressure and heat. We also demonstrate various complex pattern geometries, such as wave, square, nut, zigzag, and elliptical nanostructures, on diverse substrates via T-nTP. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to obtain a high-density crossbar metal-insulator-metal memristive array using a combined method of T-nTP and directed self-assembly. We expect that the state-of-the-art T-nTP process presented here combined with other emerging patterning techniques will be especially useful for the large-area nanofabrication of various devices.","Park, Tae Wan; Byun, Myunghwan; Jung, Hyunsung; Lee, Gyu Rac; Park, Jae Hong; Jang, Hyun-Ik; Lee, Jung Woo; Kwon, Se Hun; Hong, Seungbum; Lee, Jong-Heun; Jung, Yeon Sik; Kim, Kwang Ho; Park, Woon Ik",Sci Adv,,34

Medical students' views on their role in the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated modifications to pediatric orthopaedic practice to protect patients, families, and healthcare workers and to minimize viral transmission. It is critical to balance the benefits of alterations to current practice to reduce the chances of COVID-19 infection, with the potential long-term impact on patients. Early experiences of the pandemic from orthopaedic surgeons in China, Singapore, and Italy have provided the opportunity to take proactive and preventive measures to protect all involved in pediatric orthopaedic care. These guidelines, based on expert opinion and best available evidence, provide a framework for the management of pediatric orthopaedic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. General principles include limiting procedures to urgent cases such as traumatic injuries and deferring outpatient visits during the acute phase of the pandemic. Nonsurgical methods should be considered where possible. For patients with developmental or chronic orthopaedic conditions, it may be possible to delay treatment for 2 to 4 months without substantial detrimental long-term impact.","Farrell, Sarah; Schaeffer, Emily K; Mulpuri, Kishore",J Am Acad Orthop Surg,,34

Diluted PVP-I solutions have been historically used in Asia to treat upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) by decreasing the bacterial and viral load on oropharyngeal mucosa to decrease the transmission of diseases. Efficacy of gargling 0.23% PVP-I mouthwash in Japan demonstrated to be efficacious in lowering the prevalence of URTIs when compared with placebo. The 0.23% concentration was used in vitro on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which produced undetectable results after 30 seconds of exposure. Additionally, a recent study in 2020 proved the efficacy of PVP-I 0.45%-10% in reducing COVID-19 (SARS-CoV 2) viral load in vitro. Numerous clinical trials are being conducted to determine if there is a decrease in viral load, and thus transmission, when using oral or nasal topical PVP-I in COVID-19 patients. Because of the current lack of evidence for the use of PVP-I in vivo with COVID-19, it is recommended to await the clinical trial results before initiating this practice.","Benson, Katherine M; Mancini, Amalia A; Brodeur, Michael R",Sr Care Pharm,,34

We identified up to a 10,480-fold higher expression of viral attachment factors AXL, GAS6, and PROS1 and a 3880-fold increase in ZIKV infectiousness/propagation in human term decidual stromal cells versus trophoblasts. Moreover, levels of viral attachment factors and ZIKV are significantly increased, whereas expression of innate immune response genes are significantly decreased, in human first trimester versus term decidual cells. ZIKV-infected decidual cell supernatants increased cytotrophoblasts infection up to 252-fold compared with directly infected cytotrophoblasts. Tizoxanide treatment efficiently inhibited Zika infection in both maternal and fetal cells. We conclude that ZIKV permissiveness, as well as innate immune responsiveness of human decidual cells, are gestational age dependent, and decidual cells augment ZIKV infection of primary human cytotrophoblast cultures, which are otherwise ZIKV resistant. Human decidual cells may act as reservoirs for trimester-dependent placental transmission of ZIKV, accounting for the higher Zika infection susceptibility and more severe fetal sequelae observed in early versus late pregnancy. Moreover, tizoxanide is a promising agent in preventing perinatal Zika transmission as well as other RNA viruses such as coronavirus.","Guzeloglu-Kayisli, Ozlem; Guo, Xiaofang; Tang, Zhonghua; Semerci, Nihan; Ozmen, Asli; Larsen, Kellie; Mutluay, Duygu; Guller, Seth; Schatz, Frederick; Kayisli, Umit Ali; Lockwood, Charles Joseph",J Immunol,,34

Malaysia has not been excluded from this COVID-19 pandemic. The resurgence of COVID-19 cases has overwhelmed the public healthcare system and overloaded the healthcare resources. Ministry of Health (MOH) Malaysia has adopted an Emergency Ordinance (EO) to instruct private hospitals to receive both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients to reduce the strain on public facilities. The treatment of COVID-19 patients at private hospitals could help to boost the bed and critical care occupancy. However, with the absence of insurance coverage because COVID-19 is categorised as pandemic-related diseases, there are some challenges and opportunities posed by the treatment fees management. Another major issue in the collaboration between public and private hospitals is the willingness of private medical consultants to participate in the management of COVID-19 patients, because medical consultants in private hospitals in Malaysia are not hospital employees, but what are termed ""private contractors"" who provide patient care services to the hospitals. Other collaborative measures with private healthcare providers, e.g. tele-conferencing by private medical clinics to monitor COVID-19 patients and the rollout of national vaccination programme. The public and private healthcare partnership must be enhanced, and continue to find effective ways to collaborate further to combat the pandemic. The MOH, private healthcare sectors and insurance providers need to have a synergistic COVID-19 treatment plans to ensure public as well as insurance policy holders have equal opportunities for COVID-19 screening tests, vaccinations and treatment.","Tan, C.

Since many people cope with stress by eating, the current study investigated whether eating behaviors shifted among U.S. adults after the emergence of the pandemic. Data from national, crowdsourced surveys conducted on March 31st, 2020 and February 13th, 2019 were compared. Average levels of eating to cope and food addiction symptoms did not appear to shift during the early stages of the pandemic; however, U.S. adults ate about 14% more added sugars. Moreover, greater stress in response to the pandemic was associated with greater eating to cope, added sugars intake, food addiction symptoms, drinking to cope, and drinking frequency. These associations differed by the presence of state-level stay-at-home orders, perceived vulnerability to disease, age, U.S. political party affiliation, and gender. Although eating behaviors did not appear to majorly shift during the early stages of the pandemic, stress from the pandemic may intensify some maladaptive coping tendencies among U.S. adults.","Cummings, Jenna R; Ackerman, Joshua M; Wolfson, Julia A; Gearhardt, Ashley N",Appetite,,34

DATA SOURCES: We examine radical prostatectomy in the United States and England between 2005 and 2017, using de-identified administrative claims data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse in the United States and the Hospital Episodes Statistics in England. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a longitudinal analysis of robotic, laparoscopic, and open surgery for radical prostatectomy. We compared the trends of adoption over time within and across countries. Next, we explored whether differential adoption patterns in the two health systems are associated with differences in volumes and patient characteristics. Finally, we explored the relationship between these adoption patterns and length of stay, 30-day readmission, and urology follow-up visits. DATA COLLECTION: Open, laparoscopic, and robotic radical prostatectomies are identified using Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Interventions and Procedures (OPCS) codes in England and International Classification of Diseases ninth revision (ICD9), ICD10, and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes in the United States. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified 66,879 radical prostatectomies in England and 79,358 in the United States during 2005-2017. In both countries, open surgery dominates until 2009, where it is overtaken by minimally invasive surgery. The adoption of robotic surgery is faster in the United States. The adoption rates and, as a result, the observed centralization of volume, have been different across countries. In both countries, patients undergoing radical prostatectomies are older and have more comorbidities. Minimally invasive techniques show decreased length of stay and 30-day readmissions compared to open surgery. In the United States, robotic approaches were associated with lower length of stay and readmissions when compared to laparoscopic. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic surgery has become the standard approach for radical proctectomy in the United States and England, showing decreased length of stay and in 30-day readmissions compared to open surgery. Adoption rates and specialization differ across countries, likely a product of differences in cost-containment efforts.","Maynou, Laia; Mehtsun, Winta T; Serra-Sastre, Victoria; Papanicolas, Irene",Health serv. res,,34

Moreover, an oxidative stress imbalance has been demonstrated to occur in COVID-19 patients. N- Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is a precursor of reduced glutathione (GSH). Due to its tolerability, this pleiotropic drug has been proposed not only as a mucolytic agent, but also as a preventive/therapeutic agent in a variety of disorders involving GSH depletion and oxidative stress. At very high doses, NAC is also used as an antidote against paracetamol intoxication. Thiols block the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 thereby hampering penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into cells. Based on a broad range of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, which are herein reviewed, the oral administration of NAC is likely to attenuate the risk of developing COVID-19, as it was previously demonstrated for influenza and influenza-like illnesses. Moreover, high-dose intravenous NAC may be expected to play an adjuvant role in the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases and in the control of its lethal complications, also including pulmonary and cardiovascular adverse events.","De Flora, Silvio; Balansky, Roumen; La Maestra, Sebastiano",FASEB j,,34

Therefore, it is very important to choose an appropriate method to effectively detect COVID-19 rumors. In response to this problem, this paper crawls a data set of rumors related to COVID-19 from Snopes and construct three classes containing Fake, Real, and Unverified. We try the traditional Word Embedding Model (Word2vec, Glove, FastText) and the current Pre-training Model (BERT) to detect rumor data. In addition, this paper proposes an improved method based on the BERT pre-training model. This method obtains richer semantic information by extracting BERT hidden state output.

The types of messages that may be effective in alerting smokers to this risk and encouraging a quit attempt are unknown. The aim of this study was to test a series of messages to identify potentially effective communication approaches. METHODS: An online survey was completed by 1509 smokers across three countries (Australia: n = 604; New Zealand: n = 304; United Kingdom: n = 601) in April-May 2020. Respondents were randomly assigned to view just one of four quit messages, two of which explicitly referred to the coronavirus, one referred to risk of chest infection, and one encouraged cessation for financial reasons. Outcome variables included quit intentions, further information seeking, message perceptions, and health and financial concerns. RESULTS: All four messages were associated with significant differences in the proportions of respondents intending to quit within the following 2 wk (increase range: 11%-34%) and with substantial proportions of respondents electing to access additional information (range: 37%-50%). The differences in intentions were significantly larger for the two health-related messages that specifically mentioned the coronavirus. All messages were perceived favorably in terms of acceptability, believability, effectiveness, and personal relevance. Negligible differences in health and financial concerns were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom appear likely to be receptive to messages about their COVID-related risk. Such messages have the potential to increase quit intentions and prompt information-seeking behaviors. IMPLICATIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic represents an opportunity to encourage smokers to quit to reduce both their COVID-related risks and their risks of a broad range of noncommunicable diseases.","Pettigrew, Simone; Jun, Min; Roberts, Ian; Nallaiah, Kellie; Bullen, Chris; Rodgers, Anthony",Nicotine Tob Res,,34

With the use of a bivariate and multiple regression analysis, results indicate that people visit nature more frequently than before and that nature helped to maintain social relationships during the coronavirus period. Gardens were reported to be the most popular place, followed by parks. More than half of the people experienced nature in a more positive way, and the belief that nature visits are important for general health increased. In addition, we found a positive association between nature visits and home satisfaction, as well as a positive association with subjective mental and physical health. Lastly, we identified several demographic factors contributing to the frequency of nature visits such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status.

Many patient-related factors, such as pre-existing comorbidities, affect disease severity and can be used to aid this prediction. OBJECTIVE: Because rapid automated profiling of peripheral blood samples is widely available, we aimed to investigate how data from the peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 can be used to predict clinical outcomes. METHODS: We investigated clinical data sets of patients with COVID-19 with known outcomes by combining statistical comparison and correlation methods with machine learning algorithms; the latter included decision tree, random forest, variants of gradient boosting machine, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and deep learning methods. RESULTS: Our work revealed that several clinical parameters that are measurable in blood samples are factors that can discriminate between healthy people and COVID-19-positive patients, and we showed the value of these parameters in predicting later severity of COVID-19 symptoms. We developed a number of analytical methods that showed accuracy and precision scores >90% for disease severity prediction. CONCLUSIONS: We developed methodologies to analyze routine patient clinical data that enable more accurate prediction of COVID-19 patient outcomes. With this approach, data from standard hospital laboratory analyses of patient blood could be used to identify patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk of mortality, thus enabling optimization of hospital facilities for COVID-19 treatment.","Aktar, Sakifa; Ahamad, Md Martuza; Rashed-Al-Mahfuz, Md; Azad, Akm; Uddin, Shahadat; Kamal, Ahm; Alyami, Salem A; Lin, Ping-I; Islam, Sheikh Mohammed Shariful; Quinn, Julian Mw; Eapen, Valsamma; Moni, Mohammad Ali",JMIR Med Inform,,34

The emergence of novel coronavirus disease, also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has presented an unprecedented global challenge for the healthcare community. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to get transmitted during the asymptomatic phase and its high infectivity have led to the rapid transmission of COVID-19 beyond geographic regions, leading to a pandemic. There is concern that COVID-19 is cardiotropic, and it interacts with the cardiovascular system on multiple levels. Individuals with established CVD are more susceptible to severe COVID-19. Through a consensus approach involving an international group this WHF statement summarizes the links between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 and present some practical recommendations for the management of hypertension and diabetes, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, rheumatic heart disease, Chagas disease, and myocardial injury for patients with COVID-19 in low-resource settings.

467989,COVID-19: Challenges and its consequences for rural health care in India,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) whose origin is still shed in mystery. In this study, we developed a method to search the basal SARS-CoV-2 clade among collected SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. We first identified the mutation sites in the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequence alignment. Then by the pairwise comparison of the numbers of mutation sites among all SARS-CoV-2s, the least mutated clade was identified, which is the basal clade under parsimony principle. In our first analysis, we used 168 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (GISAID dataset till 2020/03/04) to identify the basal clade which contains 33 identical viral sequences from seven countries. To our surprise, in our second analysis with 367 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (GISAID dataset till 2020/03/17), the basal clade has 51 viral sequences, 18 more sequences added. The much larger NCBI dataset shows that this clade has expanded with 85 unique sequences by 2020/04/04. The expanding basal clade tells a chilling fact that the least mutated SARS-CoV-2 sequence was replicating and spreading for at least four months. It is known that coronaviruses have the RNA proofreading capability to ensure their genome replication fidelity. Interestingly, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 without its nonstructural proteins 13 to 16 (Nsp13-Nsp16) exhibits an unusually high mutation rate. Our result suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has an unprecedented RNA proofreading capability which can intactly preserve its genome even after a long period of transmission. Our selection analyses also indicate that the positive selection event enabling SARS-CoV-2 to cross species and adapt to human hosts might have been achieved before its outbreak.","Shen, Libing; Zhang, Zhao; He, Funan",Mol Phylogenet Evol,,34

Most research projects and clinical trials were temporarily stopped or postponed. The Resident and Research Fellow Section (RRFS) of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) has decided to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on neurology training. METHODS: All EAN RRFS members were invited to fill out an online questionnaire of 40 items concerning their clinical involvement during the COVID-19 emergency, and the impact of the pandemic on their training (Appendix S1). RESULTS: Of the 227 RRFS members who completed the questionnaire, 222 were from Europe, and of those 111 were from Portugal, Italy or France. Responders highlighted that severe restrictions have been imposed to face this pandemic, including reduction of inpatient beds, prohibition of in-person visits and limitation to hospital access for patients' relatives. This was accompanied by an increase in email correspondence and phone calls with 50% of countries allowing telemedicine to reach outpatients. Seventy-nine per cent of the respondents felt that the pandemic will probably have a serious impact on their training and career. CONCLUSION: The pandemic led to a disruption of neurology activities, including medical training and research. The long-run impact of these changes remains unknown, but it will probably change the way neurology practice and training will be organized for future generations.","Cuffaro, Luca; Carvalho, Vanessa; Di Liberto, Giovanni; Klinglehoefer, Lisa; Sauerbier, Anna; Garcia-Azorin, David; Tábuas-Pereira, Miguel; Vashchenko, Nina; Moro, Elena; Bassetti, Claudio L A",Eur. j. neurol,,34

The virus infection spread rapidly and swept through China in less than a month. Subsequently, the virus was proven a novel coronavirus and named SARS-CoV-2. The outbreak of novel coronavirus has been determined as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by WHO on January 31, 2020. Similar to other coronaviruses like the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV, the novel coronavirus was reported to spread via respiratory droplets and close contact from human to human, which means the virus is highly infectious and dangerous. Unfortunately, till now the virus has spread to over 200 countries/territories/areas around the world and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is continuing to grow. Currently, information sharing and transparency are essential for risk assessment and epidemic control in all endemic areas. In this article, we compared SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and influenza virus, discussed current researching progress of COVID-19, including clinical characteristics, pathological changes, treatment measures, and so on.","Kang, Yue; Xu, Silu",Dermatol Ther,,34

We evaluated whether the pandemic has impacted the appropriateness and diagnostic yield of fast-track endoscopic procedures compared with those performed in 2019. METHODS: This retrospective study involved endoscopy services in Northern Italy. We compared data regarding endoscopic procedures performed in March and April 2020 with those performed during the same period in 2019. RESULTS: In 2020, there was a 53.6â% reduction in the number of fast-track endoscopic procedures compared with 2019. Patients undergoing endoscopy in 2020 were younger than in 2019.âBoth appropriate referral and diagnostic yield increased in 2020 for both upper and lower endoscopy. A higher rate of cancer was diagnosed in 2020 by upper endoscopy (3.6â% vs. 6.6â%; Pâ=â0.04).

We examined the association between unmet tangible support needs and self-management behaviors and mental health status during the stay-at-home orders in Chicago and New York. METHODS: We used data from the COVID-19 & Chronic Conditions study collected between May 1st and May 22nd, 2020. A total of 801 middle age and older adults with &#8805;1 chronic condition in Chicago and New York City completed the telephone interview. Adequacy of tangible social support was measured using a brief, validated scale that determined whether an individual needed assistance managing his or her health, and if yes, whether this need was met. Participants reported their level of difficulty engaging in self-management behaviors using 2 discrete items; they also self-reported medication adherence using the ASK-12 medication adherence scale. Mental health status was measured using the depression and anxiety PROMIS short-form instruments. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 63 years; 30% identified as Black, 26% identified as Latino, and 12% identified unmet support needs. Inadequacy of tangible support was associated with greater difficulty managing one's health and accessing medications due to COVID-19, as well as poorer medication adherence, increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, and poorer overall well-being (P's < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Perceived unmet support needs during stay-at-home orders were associated with greater difficulty engaging in self-management behaviors and poorer overall well-being.

The Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to major changes in the distribution, sale, purchase, preparation, and consumption of food in the United States (US). This paper reflects on those changes and provides recommendations for research to understand the impact of the pandemic on the retail food environment (RFE) and consumer behavior. Using the Retail Food Environment and Customer Interaction Model, we describe the impact of COVID-19 in four key areas: (1) community, state, tribal, and federal policy; (2) retail actors, business models, and sources; (3) customer experiences; and (4) dietary intake. We discuss how previously existing vulnerabilities and inequalities based on race, ethnicity, class, and geographic location were worsened by the pandemic. We recommend approaches for building a more just and equitable RFE, including understanding the impacts of changing shopping behaviors and adaptations to federal nutrition assistance as well as how small food business can be made more sustainable. By better understanding the RFE adaptations that have characterized the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope to gain greater insight into how our food system can become more resilient in the future.","Leone, Lucia A; Fleischhacker, Sheila; Anderson-Steeves, Betsy; Harper, Kaitlyn; Winkler, Megan; Racine, Elizabeth; Baquero, Barbara; Gittelsohn, Joel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,34

In the United States, approximately 20,000 persons advance to end-stage renal disease annually. Trends indicate accelerating increases in cost of care and a high mortality rate among patients with end-stage renal disease, with only 57% of patients surviving after 3 years. An executive order by the White House has placed the transformation of kidney care at the forefront of the country's health care agenda. The order focuses on key issues including improving outcomes, reducing treatment-related expenditures and increasing kidney donations. Mobilization of health care resources directed toward policymaking, workforce growth and development, and research will be critical to effectively achieve this executive order. Nursing's response, as the health care profession with the most members, will be crucial to achieving response implementation and success of the order. This article describes immediate and future actions including policy, leadership, clinical, educational, and research initiatives that the nursing profession should take to advance kidney health. It calls for specific actions by nursing and focuses on nursing organizations, nursing research, quality improvement initiatives, nursing innovation, advanced practice nursing, and the nephrology and transplant nursing workforce in order to improve kidney health nationally. The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on kidney health and the implications for the profession of nursing are outlined.

There is particular concern that this epidemic is unfolding in the younger population where vaccination rates are low. The Covid Infection Survey (CIS) has recently published estimates of the proportion of people with long covid whose daily activities are affected a little or a lot. This paper focuses on the population aged under 35 years and uses the term disabling long covid to describe those with symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks and daily activities limited a lot. By applying the CIS estimates to confirmed infections, with age breakdown from mid-2020 population estimates, this paper reports a first estimate of the cases of disabling long covid seeded from confirmed covid-19 infections to July 31st 2021. Results suggest there will approximately 39,000 cases of disabling long covid in those aged under 35 seeded by Covid-19 infections confirmed to July 31st. There is a need for rapid action to prevent Covid-19 infection in the younger population and support those struggling with Long Covid-related disability.","Spiers, Nicola",,,34

We sought to determine the impact of COVID-19 on arthroplasty volumes in the United States, how this varied across the country, and the resultant financial implications. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries undergoing primary and revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) from January 1st through March 31st, 2020 with 74,080 TKAs and 54,975 THAs identified. We calculated the percent drop in average daily cases from before and after March 18, 2020. We then examined variation across states in arthroplasty case volumes as it related to reported COVID-19 cases, the impact of COVID-19 on length of stay and percentage of patients discharged home. Finally, we calculated the revenue impact on hospitals and surgeons. RESULTS: There was a steep decline in TKA and THA volumes in mid-March of 94% and 92%, respectively. There was a significant variation for arthroplasty case volumes across states. We found minimal change in length of stay except for primary THAs with fracture going from 5 + days to 4 days. We saw an increasing trend in discharge to home with the greatest effect in primary THAs with fracture. The total daily hospital Medicare revenue for arthroplasty declined by 87% and surgeon revenue decreased by 85%. CONCLUSION: The beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant decrease in arthroplasty volumes in the Medicare population with a resultant substantial revenue loss for hospitals and surgeons.","Barnes, C Lowry; Zhang, Xiaoran; Stronach, Benjamin M; Haas, Derek A",J. arthroplasty,,34
496007,"The Relationship Between the Implementation of Statutory Preventative Measures, Perceived Susceptibility of COVID-19, and Personality Traits in the Initial Stage of Corona-Related Lockdown: A German and Austrian Population Online Survey",2021,"The sex discordance in COVID-19 outcomes has been widely recognized, with males generally faring worse than females and a potential link to sex steroids. A plausible mechanism is androgen-induced expression of TMPRSS2 and/or ACE2 in pulmonary tissues that may increase susceptibility or severity in males. This hypothesis is the subject of several clinical trials of anti-androgen therapies around the world. Here, we investigated the sex-associated TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression in human and mouse lungs and interrogated the possibility of pharmacologic modification of their expression with anti-androgens. We found no evidence for increased TMPRSS2 expression in the lungs of males compared to females in humans or mice. Furthermore, in male mice, treatment with the androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide did not decrease pulmonary TMPRSS2. On the other hand, ACE2 and AR expression was sexually dimorphic and higher in males than females. ACE2 was moderately suppressible with enzalutamide administration. Our work suggests that sex differences in COVID-19 outcomes attributable to viral entry are independent of TMPRSS2. Modest changes in ACE2 could account for some of the sex discordance.","Baratchian, Mehdi; McManus, Jeffrey M; Berk, Mike P; Nakamura, Fumihiko; Mukhopadhyay, Sanjay; Xu, Weiling; Erzurum, Serpil; Drazba, Judy; Peterson, John; Klein, Eric A; Gaston, Benjamin; Sharifi, Nima",Sci Rep,,34

498066,The Health Impacts of COVID-19-Related Racial Discrimination of Asian Americans Extend Into the Workplace,2021,"BACKGROUND: Between March and December, 2020, more than 20 000 laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported in Zambia. However, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections is likely to be higher than the confirmed case counts because many infected people have mild or no symptoms, and limitations exist with regard to testing capacity and surveillance systems in Zambia. We aimed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in six districts of Zambia in July, 2020, using a population-based household survey. METHODS: Between July 4 and July 27, 2020, we did a cross-sectional cluster-sample survey of households in six districts of Zambia. Within each district, 16 standardised enumeration areas were randomly selected as primary sampling units using probability proportional to size. 20 households from each standardised enumeration area were selected using simple random sampling. All members of selected households were eligible to participate. Consenting participants completed a questionnaire and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time PCR (rtPCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using ELISA. Prevalence estimates, adjusted for the survey design, were calculated for each diagnostic test separately, and combined. We applied the prevalence estimates to census population projections for each district to derive the estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. FINDINGS: Overall, 4258 people from 1866 households participated in the study. The median age of participants was 18·2 years (IQR 7·7-31·4) and 50·6% of participants were female. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence for the combined measure was 10·6% (95% CI 7·3-13·9). The rtPCR-positive prevalence was 7·6% (4·7-10·6) and ELISA-positive prevalence was 2·1% (1·1-3·1). An estimated 454 708 SARS-CoV-2 infections (95% CI 312 705-596 713) occurred in the six districts between March and July, 2020, compared with 4917 laboratory-confirmed cases reported in official statistics from the Zambia National Public Health Institute. INTERPRETATION: The estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections was much higher than the number of reported cases in six districts in Zambia. The high rtPCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was consistent with observed community transmission during the study period. The low ELISA-positive SARS-CoV-2 prevalence might be associated with mitigation measures instituted after initial cases were reported in March, 2020. Zambia should monitor patterns of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and promote measures that can reduce transmission.

However, multiple recent findings have verified its importance in blocking virus spread. Evidence on the association between mobility, cases imported from abroad and local medical resource supplies is limited. To reveal the association, this study quantified the importance of inter- and intra-country mobility in containing virus spread and avoiding hospitalizations during early stages of COVID-19 outbreaks in India, Japan, and China. We calculated the time-varying reproductive number (Rt) and duration from illness onset to diagnosis confirmation (Doc), to represent conditions of virus spread and hospital bed shortages, respectively. Results showed that inter-country mobility fluctuation could explain 80%, 35%, and 12% of the variance in imported cases and could prevent 20 million, 5 million, and 40 million imported cases in India, Japan and China, respectively. The critical time for screening and monitoring of imported cases is 2 weeks at minimum and 4 weeks at maximum, according to the time when the Pearson's Rs between Rt and imported cases reaches a peak (>0.8). We also found that if local transmission is initiated, a 1% increase in intra-country mobility would result in 1430 (±501), 109 (±181), and 10 (±1) additional bed shortages, as estimated using the Doc in India, Japan, and China, respectively. Our findings provide vital reference for governments to tailor their pre-vaccination policies regarding mobility, especially during future epidemic waves of COVID-19 or similar severe epidemic outbreaks.","Ren, Zhehao; Li, Ruiyun; Zhang, Tao; Chen, Bin; Wang, Che; Li, Miao; Song, Shuang; Xiao, Yixiong; Xu, Bo; Liu, Zhaoyang; Shen, Chong; Guan, Dabo; Hou, Lin; Deng, Ke; Bai, Yuqi; Gong, Peng; Xu, Bing",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,34

When the system is hole doped, and in the presence of a finite interorbital Coulomb interaction we find the emergence of a novel holon-doublon in-gap subband which is split by the Hund's coupling. We also observe new interesting features in the DOS like the splitting of the lower Hubbard band into a coherent narrowly dispersing peak around the Fermi energy, and another subband which evolves with the chemical potential. We characterize the main transitions giving rise to each subband by calculating the response functions of specific projected operators and comparing with the energies in the atomic limit, obtaining excellent agreement. The detailed results for the spectral functions found in this work pave the way to study with great precision the microscopic quantum behavior in correlated materials.","Hallberg, K.; N'unez-Fern'andez, Y.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14923v1.pdf,34

Considering that the mechanism for myocardial injury is reported to result mainly from the direct viral involvement of cardiomyocytes and the effects of systemic inflammation, our scope is to evaluate the relation of the increased level of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and the cardiovascular complications due to COVID-19. Design and method: We conducted a systematic literature search on various databases such as PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus to identify the relevant articles. We included studies published until September 2020. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was utilized to analyze the prognostic ability of CRP in the cardio-vascular complications from COVID-19. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q test and I2 test. The presence of publication bias was evaluated by visual inspection of the symmetry in funnel plots Results: Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria with more than 10,630 participants. Subgroup analysis of the clinical classification included acute myocardial injury, CHF, CAD and thromboembolic events. The ROC curve shows that AUC (CHF)=85% (95% CI of 0.598 to 1);AUC (CAD)=81% (95% CI of 05.44 to 1);AUC (Thromboembolic events)=100% (95% CI of 1 to 1). The Kaplan-Meier curve and the log-rank test were applied to further assess the potential risk factors associated with the progression of cardiovascular complications from COVID-19. The Youden index was implemented to set cutoff values. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS 23.0 software. Conclusions: This meta-analysis implies that CRP could be a valuable marker to anticipate the cardiovascular complications from COVID-19.

METHODS: A retrospective investigation was made on the medical records of the patients with severe and critical patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from January to February 2020. First, the patients who received corticosteroid treatment were compared with patients without given corticosteroid treatment. Then a propensity score matching method was used to control confounding factors. Cox survival regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of corticosteroid therapy on the mortality of severe and critical patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 371 severe and critical patients were included in our analyses. 209 patients were treated with corticosteroid therapy. Most of them were treated with methylprednisolone (197[94.3%]). The median corticosteroid therapy was applied 3(IQR 2-6) days after admission, 13(IQR 10-17) days after symptoms appeared. Temperature on admission(OR=1.255,[95%CI 1.021-1.547],p=0.032), ventilation(OR=1.926,[95%CI 1.148-3.269],p=0.014) and ICU admission(OR=3.713, [95%CI 1.776-8.277],p<0.001) were significantly associated with corticosteroids use. After PS matching, the cox regression survival analysis showed that corticosteroid use was significantly associated with a lower mortality rate (HR=0.592, [95%CI 0.406-0.862], p=0.006). CONCLUSION: Corticosteroid therapy use in severe and critical patients with COVID-19 pneumonia leads to lower mortality but may cause other side effects. Corticosteroid therapy should be used carefully.","Chen, Qian; Song, Yang; Wang, Lu; Zhang, Yipeng; Han, Lu; Liu, Jingru; Yang, Mengyu; Ma, Jingdong; Wang, Tao",Expert rev. respir. med,,34

Importantly, TRM are mostly non-recirculating, which reduces the window of opportunity to examine these cells in the blood as they move to the lung parenchyma. Here, we identify circulating virus-specific T cell responses during acute infection with functional, migratory and apoptotic patterns modulated by viral proteins and associated with clinical outcome. Disease severity is associated predominantly with IFNÎ³ and IL-4 responses, increased responses against S peptides and apoptosis, whereas non-hospitalized patients have increased IL-12p70 levels, degranulation in response to N peptides and SARS-CoV-2-specific CCR7+ T cells secreting IL-10. In convalescent patients, lung-TRM are frequently detected even 10 months after initial infection, in which contemporaneous blood does not reflect tissue-resident profiles. Our study highlights a balanced anti-inflammatory antiviral response associated with a better outcome and persisting TRM cells as important for future protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Grau-Expósito, Judith; Sánchez-Gaona, Nerea; Massana, Núria; Suppi, Marina; Astorga-Gamaza, Antonio; Perea, David; Rosado, Joel; Falcó, Anna; Kirkegaard, Cristina; Torrella, Ariadna; Planas, Bibiana; Navarro, Jordi; Suanzes, Paula; Álvarez-Sierra, Daniel; Ayora, Alfonso; Sansano, Irene; Esperalba, Juliana; Andrés, Cristina; Antón, Andrés; Ramón Y Cajal, Santiago; Almirante, Benito; Pujol-Borrell, Ricardo; Falcó, Vicenç; Burgos, Joaquín; Buzón, María J; Genescà, Meritxell",Nat Commun,,34
507150,Global health and innovation: A panoramic view on health human resources in the COVID-19 pandemic context,2021,"BACKGROUND: In view of the growth of published papers, there is an increasing need for studies that summarise scientific research. An increasingly common review is a ""methodology scoping review"", which provides a summary of existing analytical methods, techniques and software, proposed or applied in research articles, which address an analytical problem or further an analytical approach. However, guidelines for their design, implementation and reporting are limited. METHODS: Drawing on the experiences of the authors, which were consolidated through a series of face-to-face workshops, we summarise the challenges inherent in conducting a methodology scoping review and offer suggestions of best practice to promote future guideline development. RESULTS: We identified three challenges of conducting a methodology scoping review. First, identification of search terms; one cannot usually define the search terms a priori and the language used for a particular method can vary across the literature. Second, the scope of the review requires careful consideration since new methodology is often not described (in full) within abstracts. Third, many new methods are motivated by a specific clinical question, where the methodology may only be documented in supplementary materials. We formulated several recommendations that build upon existing review guidelines. These recommendations ranged from an iterative approach to defining search terms through to screening and data extraction processes. CONCLUSION: Although methodology scoping reviews are an important aspect of research, there is currently a lack of guidelines to standardise their design, implementation and reporting.

508147,Sustaining and strengthening community resilience throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond,2020,"BACKGROUND: At present, no agents are known to be effective at preventing COVID-19. Based on current knowledge of the pathogenesis of this disease, we suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection might be attenuated by directly maintaining innate pulmonary redox, metabolic and dilation functions using well-tolerated medications that are known to serve these functions, specifically, a low-dose aerosolized combination of glutathione, inosine and potassium. METHODS: From June 1 to July 10, 2020, we conducted a pilot, prospective, open-label, single-arm, single-center study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with aerosolized combination medication (ACM) on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in 99 healthcare workers (HCWs) at a hospital designated for treating COVID-19 patients. We compared SARS-CoV-2 positivity in ACM users to retrospective data collected from 268 untreated HCWs at the same hospital. Eligible participants received an aerosolized combination of 21.3 mg/ml glutathione and 8.7 mg/ml inosine in 107 mM potassium solution for 14 days. The main outcome was the frequency of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, defined as individuals with positive genetic or immunological tests within 28 days of the study period. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 2 ACM users (2, 95% CI: 0.3 to 7.1%), which was significantly less than the incidence in nonusers, at 24 (9, 95% CI: 5.8 to 13.0%; P = 0.02). During the PrEP period, solicited adverse events occurred in five participants; all were mild and transient reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings might be used either to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or to support ongoing and new research into more effective treatments for COVID-19.

For Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), we show that rhesus macaques seroconverted rapidly after a single intramuscular vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS. The vaccine protected against respiratory injury and pneumonia and reduced viral load in lung tissue by several orders of magnitude. MERS-CoV replication in type I and II pneumocytes of ChAdOx1 MERS-vaccinated animals was absent. A prime-boost regimen of ChAdOx1 MERS boosted antibody titers, and viral replication was completely absent from the respiratory tract tissue of these rhesus macaques. We also found that antibodies elicited by ChAdOx1 MERS in rhesus macaques neutralized six different MERS-CoV strains. Transgenic human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 mice vaccinated with ChAdOx1 MERS were completely protected against disease and lethality for all different MERS-CoV strains.

Older adults, especially those who are nearing the end of life, are already at higher risk of the detrimental effects of social isolation and loneliness. Novel social distancing rules imposed by governments and agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic have caused older adults to experience a degree of social isolation and loneliness that is unprecedented. This article highlights aspects of the social isolation and loneliness literature. Three cases of elderly patients who required medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic are presented. Common themes of factors contributing to social isolation in each of the health care delivery settings are described, and opportunities for creative interventions by health care providers are identified. As the pandemic continues to unfold and evolve, providers should aim to regularly assess patient risk of isolation and be proactive in preventing negative effects. Additionally, what is learned from health care providers' experiences delivering palliative care during a pandemic can be incorporated into daily practice as social isolation and loneliness are long-standing challenges for the elderly population.","Harden, Karen; Price, Deborah M; Mason, Heidi; Bigelow, April",J Hosp Palliat Nurs,,34

METHODS: Prospective sub-study of the ongoing ArcHIV cohort between May and July 2020. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were measured using the recomWell SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (Mikrogen, Neuried, Germany); positive and borderline results were re-tested using the recomLine SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay (Mikrogen, Neuried, Germany). Demographic and medical data were extracted from the electronic patient files. RESULTS: Overall, 500 people living with HIV were included in the study (83% male, median age 51 years). Three participants had been diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to study inclusion. Of those, nine were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, resulting in an estimated seroprevalence (accounting for sensitivity and specificity of the test) of 1.5% (CI 95%: 0.69; 3.13) for the entire study sample, and 2.2% (CI 95%: 1.1; 3.9) for the subset of the Munich citizens. There were no marked differences for people living with HIV with and without SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in people living with HIV as found in our study does not seem to exceed previous reports from general populations of 'hot-sport' areas; comparative data from the Munich population can be expected to be published soon. Our data also highlight, once more, the need to do confirmatory testing on positive samples to minimize the impact of false-positive results.","Noe, S; Schabaz, F; Heldwein, S; Mayer, W; Ruecker, K; Tiller, F W; von Krosigk, A; Wiese, C; Balogh, A; Gersbacher, E; Jonsson-Oldenbuettel, C; Jaeger, H; Wolf, E",Infection,,34

They have been widely used in the food industry as biopreservatives. The generation of hybrid peptides by combining the genes that encode two different bacteriocins has made it possible to study the mechanisms of action of the bacteriocins that compose them and also develop new peptides with improved biotechnological applications. Hybrid bacteriocins may be obtained in several ways. In our laboratory, by combining enterocin CRL35 and microcin V (Ent35-MccV), we obtained a broad-spectrum peptide that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Ent35-MccV is sensitive to the action of intestinal proteases and is heat resistant, which makes it a good candidate for use as a biopreservative. For this reason, the peptide was tested in skim milk and beef burgers as food models. We also obtained more potent variants of the hybrid by modifying the central amino acid of the hinge region that connects the two bacteriocins. This review also discusses future applications and perspectives regarding the Ent35-MccV and other hybrid peptides.Key Pointsâ¢ Ent35-MccV is a new broad-spectrum bacteriocin.â¢ The mechanism of action of bacteriocins can be studied using hybrid peptides.â¢ Genetic engineering allows obtaining improved bacteriocin derivatives.â¢ Hybrid peptides can be used in the food, pharmaceutical, and veterinary applications.","Navarro, S A; Lanza, L; Acuña, L; Bellomio, A; Chalón, Miriam C",Appl. microbiol. biotechnol,,34

As the disease spread, demands on health care systems increased, specifically the need to expand hospital capacity. Alternative care hospitals (ACHs) have been used to mitigate these issues; however, establishing an ACH has many challenges. The goal of this session was to perform systems testing, using a simulation-based evaluation to identify areas in need of improvement. METHODS: Four simulation cases were designed to depict common and high acuity situations encountered in the ACH, using a high technology simulator and standardized patient. A multidisciplinary observer group was given debriefing forms listing the objectives, critical actions, and specific areas to focus their attention. These forms were compiled for data collection. RESULTS: Logistical, operational, and patient safety issues were identified during the simulation and compiled into a simulation event report. Proposed solutions and protocol changes were made in response to the identified issues. CONCLUSION: Simulation was successfully used for systems testing, supporting efforts to maximize patient care and provider safety in a rapidly developed ACH. The simulation event report identified operational deficiencies and safety concerns directly resulting in equipment modifications and protocol changes.","Petrone, Gianna; Brown, Linda; Binder, William; Naganathan, Sonya; Pasichow, Scott; Rybasack-Smith, Heather; Duquette, Cathy E; Palka, Dana R; Musits, Andrew N",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,34

This 3-year follow-up study assesses late adverse effects, evaluates rehabilitative long-term effects and identifies patients who benefit the most. DESIGN: RePCa was a randomized clinical trial with multidisciplinary rehabilitation (n = 79) or usual care (n = 82). The intervention during the first 6 months consisted of consultations by nurses and physiotherapists focusing on psychosocial support and physical activity, respectively. Here we report the 3-year follow-up. Data consisted of disease-specific quality of life (EPIC-26), general quality of life (SF-12) and pelvic floor strength measured by electromyography. RESULTS: One hundred forty-three patients (92%) responded. The primary outcome urinary irritative sum-score was no longer significantly different between groups. In patients with moderate-severe urinary problems at baseline, we observed a significant long-term effect on the urinary irritative sum-score in favour of the intervention (+ 13.4 points P = .014). More patients had moderate-severe bowel problems in the control group (n = 10; 14%) compared to the intervention group (n = 2; 3%) (P = .016). Pelvic floor strength deteriorated significantly in both groups. CONCLUSION: The short-term rehabilitation was beneficial but of limited benefit in the long term for all patients. A significant and clinically relevant effect was found in irradiated prostate cancer patients with moderate-severe urinary problems at baseline. In both groups, pelvic floor strength was weakened during follow-up. IMPACT FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Prior research showed patients benefit from early rehabilitation. Identification of patients with moderate-severe urinary problems followed by a focused rehabilitation during the first 6 months after radiotherapy results in long-term improvement. Radiated patients have to be aware of their pelvic floor strength. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Patients can be informed that they benefit from early rehabilitation, and they cannot expect larger changes in adverse effects within the first years, but they have to be aware of their pelvic floor strength. Future rehabilitation studies could be applied mainly to patients with assessed rehabilitation needs after radiotherapy and intensified with long-term follow-up.","Dieperink, Karin B; Hansen, Steinbjørn; Wagner, Lis; Minet, Lisbeth R; Hansen, Olfred",,,34

These devices are useful for compact beam division and the combination of linear and 2-D arrays. However, the standard design requires unique thin-film coating sections for each input beam; thus, potential for scaling to high beam-counts is limited due to manufacturing complexity. Taking advantage of the relative insensitivity of the beam combination process to amplitude variations, numerical techniques are used to optimize highly simplified designs with only one, two or three unique coatings. It is demonstrated that with correctly chosen coating reflectivities, the simplified optics are capable of high combination efficiency for several tens of beams. The performance of these optics as beam splitters in multicore fiber amplifier systems is analyzed, and inhomogeneous power distribution of the simplified designs is noted as a potential source of combining loss in such systems. These simplified designs may facilitate further scaling of filled-aperture coherently combined systems in linear array or 2-D array formats.","Aleshire, Christopher; Steinkopff, Albrecht; Jauregui, Cesar; Klenke, Arno; Tünnermann, Andreas; Limpert, Jens",Opt Express,,34

Depending on its anatomical location, cholangiocarcinoma is categorized as intrahepatic (iCCA), perihilar (pCCA), or distal (dCCA). Nearly two-thirds of patients with biliary tract cancer present with advanced disease at diagnosis and in 68-86% of resections the cancer eventually recurs either locoregionally or at a distance. Chemotherapy is the first-line therapy for advanced or recurrent BTC. With the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-guided molecular targeted therapy, more options are available for treatment of advanced BTC. Chemotherapy, and especially a triplet regimen based on gemcitabine/cisplatin/nab-paclitaxel, has had the most significant effect, and fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan plus oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) combined with bevacizumab is promising. Molecular targeted therapy should be based on genome sequencing and appears essential to precision medicine. Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitors and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) inhibitors are promising emerging targeted therapies mainly for iCCA. Other targeted therapies such as anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) therapies, MEK inhibitors, BRAF inhibitors, and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors had tentatively displayed efficacy. Further evaluations of combination strategies in particular are needed. An immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) alone is less efficacious, but an ICI in addition to chemotherapy or radiotherapy has resulted in a response according to many case series. However, ICIs are still being evaluated in several ongoing studies. Combination therapies have garnered attention because of interactions between signaling pathways of carcinogenesis in BTC.","Zhang, Wei; Zhou, Hongyuan; Wang, Yingying; Zhang, Zewu; Cao, Guangtai; Song, Tianqiang; Zhang, Ti; Li, Qiang",Bioscience trends (Online),,34

Due to the reduction of cytokine release, it is effective in chronic graft-versus-host disease, and its use has also been suggested in autoimmune diseases and in prevention of COVID-19-associated lung damage. Despite this effect on the immune response, we report a severe hypersensitivity reaction in a 76-year-old male patient diagnosed with prolymphocytic leukemia. Four weeks after the ibrutinib start, non-oliguric acute kidney injury with proteinuria and microscopic hematuria developed and that was accompanied by lower limb purpuras and paresthesia. Renal biopsy revealed acute interstitial nephritis. Employing 1 mg/kg methylprednisolone administration, serum creatinine decreased from 365 µmol/L to 125 µmol/L at 11 days and the proteinuria-hematuria as well as the purpura, paresthesia resolved. Three months later at stabile eGFR of 56 ml/min/1.73 m2 methylprednisolone was withdrawn and a rituximab-venetoclax treatment was initiated without side effects.

With the advent of increasingly sophisticated digital tools to capture and extract numerical data from social life, however, there is a pressing need to understand the ethical stakes of quantification. The current study examines quantification from an ethical lens, to frame and promote a research agenda around the ethics of quantification. After a brief overview of quantification research and its uses in state and market organization, I discuss quantification in terms of three core subprocesses—capture, specification, and appropriation, illustrating and identifying ethical concerns around each process. Linking these processes to the performative effects of measures, I present a working model of quantification from which the discussion builds ideas for developing a research agenda around quantification.","Islam, Gazi",J Bus Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424066/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-020-04694-z,34

PED virus (PEDV) spreads by fecal–oral contact and can be prevented by oral immunization. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective oral vaccine against PEDV infection. Currently, Bacillus subtilis as recombinant vaccine carrier has been used for antigen delivery and proved well in immune effect and safety. The present study evaluated the immunogenicity of recombinant Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis-RC) in piglets via oral administration. After oral immunization in piglets, B. subtilis-RC significantly increased the local mucosal immune responses. Oral administration with B. subtilis-RC significantly improved the level of specific mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against PEDV infection, through enlarging the area of Peyer’s patches (PPs) and increasing the number of ileum IgA(+) secreting (SIgA) cells. In the meantime, B. subtilis-RC remarkably increased the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). We also observed that oral administration of B. subtilis-RC significantly increased CD3(+)T lymphocytes’ numbers and up-regulated the ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, high titers of specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) revealed satisfactory systemic immune response against PEDV infection. In summary, our study demonstrated that oral administration of B. subtilis-RC could trigger a high level of local and systemic immune responses and would be a promising candidate vaccine against PEDV infection in piglets.","Wang, Jialu; Huang, Lulu; Mou, Chunxiao; Zhang, En; Wang, Yongheng; Cao, Yanan; Yang, Qian",Biosci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20182028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30808716/,34

597600,COVID-19 Infection and the Kidneys: Learning the Lesson,2021-05-26,"BACKGROUND: The project “Precision Health and Everyday Democracy” (PHED) is a transdisciplinary partnership that combines a diverse range of perspectives necessary for understanding the increasingly complex societal role played by modern health care and medical research. The term “precision health” is being increasingly used to express the need for greater awareness of environmental and genomic characteristics that may lead to divergent health outcomes between different groups within a population. Enhancing awareness of diversity has parallels with calls for “health democracy” and greater patient-public participation within health care and medical research. Approaching health care in this way goes beyond a narrow focus on the societal determinants of health, since it requires considering health as a deliberative space, which occurs often at the banal or everyday level. As an initial empirical focus, PHED is directed toward the health needs of marginalized migrants (including refugees and asylum seekers, as well as migrants with temporary residency, often involving a legally or economically precarious situation) as vulnerable groups that are often overlooked by health care. Developing new transdisciplinary knowledge on these groups provides the potential to enhance their wellbeing and benefit the wider society through challenging the exclusions of these groups that create pockets of extreme ill-health, which, as we see with COVID-19, should be better understood as “acts of self-harm” for the wider negative impact on humanity. OBJECTIVE: We aim to establish and identify precision health strategies, as well as promote equal access to quality health care, drawing upon knowledge gained from studying the health care of marginalized migrants. METHODS: The project is based in Sweden at Malmö and Lund Universities. At the outset, the network activities do not require ethical approval where they will not involve data collection, since the purpose of PHED is to strengthen international research contacts, establish new research within precision strategies, and construct educational research activities for junior colleagues within academia. However, whenever new research is funded and started, ethical approval for that specific data collection will be sought. RESULTS: The PHED project has been funded from January 1, 2019. Results of the transdisciplinary collaboration will be disseminated via a series of international conferences, workshops, and web-based materials. To ensure the network project advances toward applied research, a major goal of dissemination is to produce tools for applied research, including information to enhance health accessibility for vulnerable communities, such as marginalized migrant populations in Sweden. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to identify tools to enable the prevention and treatment of a wide spectrum of health-related outcomes and their link to social as well as environmental issues. There is also a need to identify and investigate barriers to precision health based on democratic principles.

601187,Vitamin D(3) Administration to Patients with Confirmed COVID-19,2020-10-11,"In mammalian cells, widespread acceleration of cytoplasmic mRNA degradation is linked to impaired RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. This mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression occurs during infection with gammaherpesviruses including Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), which encode an mRNA endonuclease that initiates widespread RNA decay. Here, we show that MHV68-induced mRNA decay leads to a genome-wide reduction of Pol II occupancy at mammalian promoters. This reduced Pol II occupancy is accompanied by down-regulation of multiple Pol II subunits and TFIIB in the nucleus of infected cells, as revealed by mass spectrometry-based global measurements of protein abundance. Viral genes, despite the fact that they require Pol II for transcription, escape transcriptional repression. Protection is not governed by viral promoter sequences; instead, location on the viral genome is both necessary and sufficient to escape the transcriptional repression effects of mRNA decay. We propose a model in which the ability to escape from transcriptional repression is linked to the localization of viral DNA within replication compartments, providing a means for these viruses to counteract decay-induced transcript loss.","Hartenian, Ella; Gilbertson, Sarah; Federspiel, Joel D.; Cristea, Ileana M.; Glaunsinger, Britt A.",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32032393/,34

METHODS: Non a priori designed secondary analysis of a prospectively enrolled cohort study subjects <12 h of life between 24(0) and 29(6) weeks gestation. Cerebral saturations (rScO2) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) were continuously monitored every 30 s for 96 h. ICA was defined by a 10 min epoch rScO2-MAP correlation coefficient of >0.5. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 61 subjects (38%) required dopamine. Time spent with ICA was 23% in dopamine-exposed subjects vs. 14% in those not exposed (p = 0.0001). On the epoch level, time spent with ICA was 15%, 29%, 34%, 37%, and 23% in epochs with dopamine titration of 0, 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, and 16–20 μg/kg/min, respectively. Using mixed-effect modeling, ICA for each dopamine titration was significantly higher than unexposed times when controlling for gestation, presence of a patent ductus arteriosus, day of life, MAP less than gestational age, and illness severity score (p < 0.02).

Here, we evaluated in one hundred and ninety-one unselected primary school children, the relationship between sleepiness and a wide range of cognitive and academic skills through a standardized neuropsychological test battery. In order to assess the statistical relationship, we performed a partial least squares path modelling, a non-parametrical approach which combined a model of paths between latent variables and the coefficients between indicators and dimensions. Results were validated through the bootstrap approach and suggest that sleepiness is not associated with all cognitive and scholastic abilities, but only with those relying on verbal abilities and complex cognitive functions (i.e., reading comprehension, oral/syntactic comprehension, spelling, and mathematic skills). Our data suggest the idea that sleepiness in children is associated mostly with “higher” (mainly verbal) cognitive function(s), while the visuospatial domain was not affected.","Macchitella, Luigi; Marinelli, Chiara Valeria; Signore, Fulvio; Ciavolino, Enrico; Angelelli, Paola",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32784660/; https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci10080529,34

Virus-laden aerosols produced by infected patients can propagate throughout ventilated rooms and put medical personnel entering them at risk. Experimental results found with a schlieren optical method have shown that the air flows generated by a cough and normal breathing were modified by the oxygenation technique used, especially when using High Flow Nasal Canulae, increasing the shedding of potentially infectious airborne particles. This study also uses a 3D Computer Fluid Dynamics model based on a Lattice Boltzmann Method to simulate the air flows as well as the movement of numerous airborne particles produced by a patient's cough within an ICU room under negative pressure. The effects of different mitigation scenarii on the amount of aerosols potentially containing SARS-CoV-2 that are extracted through the ventilation system are investigated. Numerical results indicate that adequate bed orientation and additional air treatment unit positioning can increase by 40% the number of particles extracted and decrease by 25% the amount of particles deposited on surfaces 45s after shedding. This approach could help lay the grounds for a more comprehensive way to tackle contamination risks in hospitals, as the model can be seen as a proof of concept and be adapted to any room configuration.","Crawford, C.; Vanoli, E.; Decorde, B.; Lancelot, M.; Duprat, C.; Josserand, C.; Jilesen, J.; Bouadma, L.; Timsit, J.-F.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.11.20247551; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247551v1?rss=1,34
603428,E-health roadmap for COVID-19 vaccine coverage in Iran,2021-07-23,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammation plays a key role in atherosclerosis. The complement system is involved in atherogenesis, and the complement receptor 1 (CR1) plays a role facilitating the clearance of immune complexes from the circulation. Limited evidence suggests that CR1 may be involved in cardiovascular disease. We investigated the relationship between CR1 gene polymorphisms and cardiovascular risk. METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CR1 region (n = 73) on chromosome 1 were assessed in 5244 participants in PROSPER (PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) (mean age 75.3 years), who had been randomized to pravastatin 40 mg/day or placebo and followed for a mean of 3.2 years. Logistic regression, adjusted for gender, age, country and use of pravastatin, was used to assess the association between the SNPs and cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: All 73 SNPs within the genomic region of the CR1 gene on chromosome 1 were extracted. In this region, strong LD was present leading to the occurrence of two haploblocks. Twelve of the 73 investigated CR1 SNPs were significantly associated with the risk of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (all p < 0.05). Moreover, most of the associated SNPs were also associated with levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP). The global p-value for the tail strength method to control for multiple testing was 0.0489, implying that the null hypothesis of no associated SNPs can be rejected. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that genetic variation within the CR1 gene is associated with inflammation and the risk of incident coronary artery disease.","de Vries, Marijke A.; Trompet, Stella; Mooijaart, Simon P.; Smit, Roelof A.J.; Böhringer, Stefan; Castro Cabezas, Manuel; Jukema, J.

To control infection spread with the least disruption to economic and societal activities, it is crucial to implement the various interventions effectively. In this study, we developed an agent-based SEIR model, using real demographic and geographic data from Hong Kong, to analyse the efficiency of various intervention strategies in preventing infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Close contact route including short-range airborne is considered as the main transmission routes for COVID-19 spread. Contact tracing is not that useful if all other interventions have been fully deployed. The number of infected individuals could be halved if people reduced their close contact rate by 25%. For reducing transmission, students should be prioritized for vaccination rather than retired older people and preschool aged children. Home isolation, and taking the nucleic acid test (NAT) as soon as possible after symptom onset, are much more effective interventions than wearing masks in public places. Temperature screening in public places only disrupted the infection spread by a small amount when other interventions have been fully implemented. Our results may be useful for other highly populated cities, when choosing their intervention strategies to prevent outbreaks of COVID-19 and similar diseases.","Zhang, Nan; Jack Chan, Pak-To; Jia, Wei; Dung, Chung-Hin; Zhao, Pengcheng; Lei, Hao; Su, Boni; Xue, Peng; Zhang, Weirong; Xie, Jingchao; Li, Yuguo",Environ Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161908/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412021003482; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412021003482; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.106723,34

Two astroviruses have previously been identified in cats, and while definitive evidence is lacking, an association with enteritis is suggested. Using metagenomic next-generation sequencing of viral nucleic acids from faecal samples, we identified two novel feline astroviruses termed Feline astrovirus 3 and 4. These viruses were isolated from healthy shelter-housed kittens (Feline astrovirus 3; 6448 bp) and from a kitten with diarrhoea that was co-infected with Feline parvovirus (Feline astrovirus 4, 6549 bp). Both novel astroviruses shared a genome arrangement of three open reading frames (ORFs) comparable to that of other astroviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated ORFs, ORF1a, ORF1b and capsid protein revealed that both viruses were phylogenetically distinct from other feline astroviruses, although their precise evolutionary history could not be accurately determined due to a lack of resolution at key nodes. Large-scale molecular surveillance studies of healthy and diseased cats are needed to determine the pathogenicity of feline astroviruses as single virus infections or in co-infections with other enteric viruses.","Brussel, Kate Van; Wang, Xiuwan; Shi, Mang; Carrai, Maura; Li, Jun; Martella, Vito; Beatty, Julia A.; Holmes, Edward C.; Barrs, Vanessa R.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33198334/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12111301,34

Role of corticosteroids is controversial in many conditions e.g. idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, bronchiolitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hyperplasia of thymus, bronchiolitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, aspiration syndromes, atypical pneumonias, laryngeal diphtheria, AIDS, SARS, sarcoidosis, meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), pulmonary haemorrhage, bronchitis, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia in JRA, histiocytosis, á-1 antitrypsin deficiency, bordtella pertusis, pulmonary involvement in histiocytosis. However these are used empirically in many of these conditions despite lack of clear evidence in favour. There is concern about their side effects, especially on growth. Systemic steroids are associated with significant adverse effects. Pulmonary conditions have a strategic advantage that inhaled corticosteroids are useful in many of these. Although inhaled preparations of corticosteroids have been developed to maximise effective treatment of lung diseases characterised by inflammation and reduce the frequency of harmful effects, these have not been eliminated. There are situations where only systemic steroids are useful. Clinicians must weigh the benefits against the potential detrimental effects.

We hypothesized that age is not sufficient, and that frailty measured by preadmission Palliative Performance Scale would be a predictor of outcomes. Improved ability to identify high-risk patients will improve clinicians’ ability to provide appropriate palliative care, including engaging in shared decision-making about life-sustaining therapies. AIM: To evaluate whether preadmission Palliative Performance Scale predicts mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study of patients admitted with COVID-19. Palliative Performance Scale was calculated from the chart. Using logistic regression, Palliative Performance Scale was assessed as a predictor of mortality controlling for demographics, comorbidities, palliative care measures and socioeconomic status. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Patients older than 18 years of age admitted with COVID-19 to a single urban public hospital in New Jersey, USA. RESULTS: Of 443 admitted patients, we determined the Palliative Performance Scale score for 374. Overall mortality was 31% and 81% in intubated patients. In all, 36% (134) of patients had a low Palliative Performance Scale score. Compared with patients with a high score, patients with a low score were more likely to die, have do not intubate orders and be discharged to a facility. Palliative Performance Scale independently predicts mortality (odds ratio 2.89; 95% confidence interval 1.42–5.85). CONCLUSIONS: Preadmission Palliative Performance Scale independently predicts mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Improved predictors of mortality can help clinicians caring for patients with COVID-19 to discuss prognosis and provide appropriate palliative care including decisions about life-sustaining therapy.","Fiorentino, Michele; Pentakota, Sri Ram; Mosenthal, Anne C; Glass, Nina E",Palliat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32677509/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216320940566,34

Clinical evaluation of nasal swab samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (COVID-19) patients showed that the assay could detect over 23.7 copies within 15 min with a 100% probability. Since the RT-LAMP assay can be performed with a portable battery-supported device, it is a rapid, simple, and sensitive diagnostic assay for COVID-19 that can be available at point-of-care. We also developed the RT-LAMP assay without the RNA extraction step–Direct RT-LAMP, which could detect more than 1.43 x 10(3) copies within 15 min with a 100% probability in clinical evaluation test. Although the Direct RT-LAMP assay was less sensitive than the standard RT-LAMP, the Direct RT-LAMP assay can be available as the rapid first screening of COVID-19 in poorly equipped areas, such as rural areas in developing countries.","Yoshikawa, Rokusuke; Abe, Haruka; Igasaki, Yui; Negishi, Saeki; Goto, Hiroaki; Yasuda, Jiro",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33147214/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008855,34

METHOD: This study took place during an age‐stratified lockdown for those under 20 years in Turkey. Participants completed a survey developed to evaluate the effects of the lockdown on ED behaviour, well‐being and quality of life (QoL) and additionally the eating disorder examination questionnaire (EDE‐Q), and scales for depression, anxiety and obsessive‐compulsive behaviour. The relationship between the EDE‐Q‐global score and other variables related to ED was examined. Linear regression analysis was performed to examine the predictive power of these variables on ED behaviour. RESULTS: Thirty‐eight ED patients with a mean age of 15.12 ± 1.56 years were included in the study. Of participants, 42.1% reported feeling an improvement in ED symptomatology, 71.0% reported none or rare conflict with parents due to eating, 39.5% reported often or always complying with their meal plan. Of participants, 92.0% agreed to ‘understanding the value of being healthy’ and stated realizing that ‘they were in control’ due to the pandemic. Of participants 36.9% scored ‘bad’ for both overall and ED related QoL. In the stepwise regression analysis depression score had the highest predictive value for ED behaviour. CONCLUSION: Almost half of the participants felt an improvement in their ED and a majority reported rare parental conflict. However, less than half reported meal plan compliance. As depression had the highest positive predictive value for ED behaviour additional screening for depression during the pandemic maybe warranted in ED patients.","Akgül, Sinem; Akdemir, Devrim; Nalbant, Kevser; Derman, Orhan; Ersöz Alan, Burcu; Tüzün, Zeynep; Kanbur, Nuray",Early Interv Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34263541/; https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.13193,34

Public health nurses faced unprecedented challenges in implementing an extensive quarantine policy to prevent disease spread. Their professional confidence, however, was shattered during the SARS crisis. This paper assesses factors related to public health nurses' confidence in managing community SARS control programs. METHODS: In May 2003, we sent structured questionnaires to all 361 health centers in Taiwan and asked the public health nurses responsible for epidemic control to complete. A total of 312 completed surveys were returned for a response rate of 86.4%. Descriptive methods and logistic regression were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Most public health nurses (71.9%) expressed a general lack of confidence in handling the SARS epidemic. Confidence was significantly associated with perceived epidemic severity (OR, 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35-0.99), daily epidemic updates (OR, 2.26; 95% CI: 1.28-3.98), and number of cases in the community (OR, 2.21; 95% CI: 1.13-4.31).

620131,FluMob: Enabling Surveillance of Acute Respiratory Infections in Health-care Workers via Mobile Phones,2017-03-17,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has posed significant challenges to governments across the world. The increase in hazardous infectious waste (HIW) caused by the pandemic is associated with the risk of transmitting the virus. In this study, hazardous waste includes infectious waste generated both by individuals and by hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. To control the outbreak by maintaining social distance and home quarantine protocols, daily necessities and health supplies must be provided to the people affected. Governments play an essential role in the management of the crisis, creating an elaborate plan for collecting HIW and providing necessities and health supplies. This paper proposes a leader-follower approach for hazardous infectious waste collection and government aid distribution to control COVID-19. At the top level of the model, government policies are designed to support people by distributing daily necessities and health supplies, and to support contractors by waste collection. The lower level of the model is related to the operational decisions of contractors with limited capacities. Due to the potential risk of virus transmission via contaminated waste, the proposed model considers the complications imposed on contractors at the lower level. Applying a stochastic programming approach, four possible scenarios are examined, dependent of the severity of the outbreak. As a solution approach, the Benders decomposition method is combined with Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The results show that government support, in addition to much better management of citizen demand, can control the spread of the virus by implementing quarantine decisions.","Valizadeh, Jaber; Hafezalkotob, Ashkan; Alizadeh, Seyed Mehdi; Mozafari, Payman",Sustain Cities Soc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.102814; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670721001050?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210670721001050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33654655/,34

Old age is the strongest factor associated with increased COVID19-related mortality, followed by sex and pre-existing conditions. The importance of genetic and immunological factors on COVID19 outcome is also starting to emerge, as demonstrated by population studies and the discovery of damaging variants in genes controlling type I IFN immunity and of autoantibodies that neutralize type I IFNs. The human protein transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it is required to activate the virus spike protein, facilitating entry into target cells. We focused on the only common TMPRSS2 non-synonymous variant predicted to be damaging (rs12329760), which has a minor allele frequency of 25% in the population. In a large population of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, we show that this variant is associated with a reduced likelihood of developing severe COVID19 (OR 0.87, 95%CI:0.79-0.97, p=0.01). This association was stronger in homozygous individuals when compared to the general population (OR 0.65, 95%CI:0.50-0.84, p=1.3x10-3). We demonstrate in vitro that this variant, which causes the amino acid substitution valine to methionine, impacts the catalytic activity of TMPRSS2 and is less able to support SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated entry into cells. TMPRSS2 rs12329760 is a common variant associated with a significantly decreased risk of severe COVID19. Further studies are needed to assess the expression of the TMPRSS2 across different age groups. Moreover, our results identify TMPRSS2 as a promising drug target, with a potential role for camostat mesilate, a drug approved for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis and postoperative reflux esophagitis, in the treatment of COVID19.

624112,Delayed Symptoms in Patients Recovered from COVID-19,2020-11-11,"Previous studies have shown that bats are reservoirs of a large number of viruses, many of which cause illness and mortality in humans and other animals. However, these bat-associated pathogens cause little, if any, clinicopathology in bats. This long-term adaptation should be reflected somewhat in the immune system. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the first line of immune defense against pathogens in vertebrates. Therefore, this study focuses on the selection of TLRs involved in virus recognition. The coding sequences of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 were sequenced in ten bats. The selection pressure acting on each gene was also detected using branch- and site-specific methods. The results showed that the ancestor of bats and certain other bat sublineages evolved under positive selection for TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9. The highest proportion of positive selection occurred in TLR9, followed by TLR8 and TLR7. All of the positively selected sites were located in the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which implied their important roles in pathogen recognition. However, TLR3 evolved under negative selection. Our results are not in line with previous studies which identified more positively selected sites in TLR8 in mammalian species. In this study, the most positively selected sites were found in TLR9. This study encompassed more species that were considered natural reservoirs of viruses. The positive selection for TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 might contribute to the adaptation of pathogen-host interaction in bats, especially in bat TLR9.

Separately, the overproduction of each of these cytokines is well described and constitutes the hallmark of inflammasomopathies and interferonopathies, respectively. While their interaction and the crosstalk between their downstream signaling pathways has been mostly investigated in the frame of infectious diseases, little information on their interconnection is still available in the context of autoinflammation promoted by sterile triggers. In this review, we will examine the respective roles of IL-1β and type I IFNs in autoinflammatory/rheumatic diseases and analyze their potential connections in the pathophysiology of some of these diseases, which could reveal novel therapeutic opportunities.","Georgel, Philippe",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34066649/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10051134,34

Here, sandwich structures consisted of magnetic particles functionalized with antibodies, target viruses, and alkaline phosphatases (ALPs) were formed, and they were magnetically concentrated on Ni patterns near an electrochemical sensor transducer. Then, the electrical signals from electrochemical markers generated by ALPs were measured with the sensor transducer, enabling highly-sensitive virus detection. The sandwich structures in the used sensor chip could be removed by applying an external magnetic field, and we could reuse the sensor transducer chip. As a proof of concepts, the repeated detection of airborne influenza virus using a single sensor chip was demonstrated with a detection limit down to a sub-PFU/mL level. Using a single reusable sensor transducer chip, the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A (H1N1) virus with different concentrations were measured down to 10 aM level. Importantly, our sensor chip exhibited reliable sensing signals even after more than 18 times of the repeated HA sensing measurements. Furthermore, airborne influenza viruses collected from the air could be measured down to 0.01 PFU/mL level. Interestingly, the detailed quantitative analysis of the measurement results revealed the degradation of HA proteins on the viruses after the air exposure. Considering the ultrasensitivity and reusability of our sensors, it can provide a powerful tool to help preventing epidemics by airborne pathogens in the future.","Shin, Junghyun; Kim, Hyeong Rae; Bae, Pan Kee; Yoo, Haneul; Kim, Jeongsu; Choi, Yoonji; Shin, Yong Beom; Hwang, Jungho; Hong, Seunghun",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96254-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34408220/,34

We develop a rapid and accurate one-step multiplex TaqMan probe-based real-time RT-PCR assay, along with a computational tool to systematically analyse the data. Our assay could detect to a limit of 15 copies of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts—based on experiments performed by spiking total human RNA with in vitro synthesized viral transcripts. The assay was evaluated by performing 184 validations for the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid gene and human RNase P as an internal control reference gene with dilutions ranging from 1-100 ng for human RNA on a cohort of 26 clinical samples. 5 of 26 patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, while 21 tested negative, consistent with the standards. The accuracy of the assay was found to be 100% sensitive and 100% specific based on the 26 clinical samples that need to be further verified using a large number of clinical samples. In summary, we present a rapid, easy to implement real-time PCR based assay with automated analysis using a novel COVID qPCR Analyzer tool with graphical user interface (GUI) to analyze the raw qRT-PCR data in an unbiased manner at a cost of under $3 per reaction and turnaround time of less than 2h, to enable in-house SARS-CoV-2 testing across laboratories.","Dharavath, Bhasker; Yadav, Neelima; Desai, Sanket; Sunder, Roma; Mishra, Rohit; Ketkar, Madhura; Bhanshe, Prasanna; Gupta, Anurodh; Redhu, Archana Kumari; Patkar, Nikhil; Dutt, Shilpee; Gupta, Sudeep; Dutt, Amit",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04405; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844020312494; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844020312494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32665985/,34

METHODS: Observational study, on children with MIS-C (May 1- June 24, 2020), in 3 pediatric hospitals in Santiago. Demographics and epidemiologic data; medical history; laboratory tests; cardiologic evaluation; treatment; and clinical outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: 27 patients (median age 6 (0-14) years) were admitted; 16/27 (59%) required intensive care admission with no deaths. 74% had no-comorbidities, and median days of symptoms before admission was 4 (2-9). Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most frequent, and inflammatory markers were increased at admission. A recent SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in 82% of cases. The severe group showed significantly lower hemoglobin and albumin, decreased platelet counts, and higher D-dimer during evolution. Echocardiography showed abnormalities (myocardial, pericardial, or coronary) on 12 patients (46%) during hospital stay. Anti-inflammatory treatment (immune globulin and/or corticosteroids) was prescribed in 24 patients. MIS-C appeared in clusters weeks after the peak of SARS-CoV-2 cases, especially in Santiago's most vulnerable areas. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the first series, of 27 children with MIS-C, in a Latin-American countrywith favorable clinical outcomes.

The main aim of this study was to assess whether 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) could be used to confirm differences in resting echocardiographic parameters, before and after active heat acclimation (HA). Thirteen male endurance trained cyclists underwent a resting blinded TTE before and after randomisation to either 5 consecutive daily exertional heat exposures of controlled hyperthermia at 32 [Formula: see text] with 70% relative humidity (RH) (HOT) or 5-days of exercise in temperate (21 [Formula: see text] with 36% RH) environmental conditions (TEMP). Measures of HA included heart rate, gastrointestinal temperature, skin temperature, sweat loss, total non-urinary fluid loss (TNUFL), plasma volume and participant's ratings of perceived exertion (RPE). Following HA, the HOT group demonstrated increased sweat loss (p = 0.01) and TNUFL (p = 0.01) in comparison to the TEMP group with a significantly decreased RPE (p = 0.01). On TTE, post exposure, there was a significant comparative increase in the HOT group in left ventricular end diastolic volume (p = 0.029), SV (p = 0.009), left atrial volume (p = 0.005), inferior vena cava diameter (p = 0.041), and a significant difference in mean peak diastolic mitral annular velocity (e’) (p = 0.044).

Host immune responses to CoVs are complex and regulated in part through antiviral interferons. However, interferon-stimulated gene products that inhibit CoVs are not well characterized4. Here, we show that lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) potently restricts infection by multiple CoVs, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV. Mechanistic studies revealed that LY6E inhibits CoV entry into cells by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, mice lacking Ly6e in hematopoietic cells were highly susceptible to a murine CoV, mouse hepatitis virus. Exacerbated viral pathogenesis in Ly6e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of hepatic immune cells, higher splenic viral burden, and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. Accordingly, we found that constitutive Ly6e directly protects primary B cells from murine CoV infection. Our results demonstrate that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of immune-mediated control of CoV in vitro and in vivo, knowledge that could help inform strategies to combat infection by emerging CoVs.","Pfaender, Stephanie; Mar, Katrina B.; Michailidis, Eleftherios; Kratzel, Annika; Boys, Ian N.; V`kovski, Philip; Fan, Wenchun; Kelly, Jenna N.; Hirt, Dagny; Ebert, Nadine; Stalder, Hanspeter; Kleine-Weber, Hannah; Hoffmann, Markus; Hoffmann, H.

627124,"Acceptability of COVID-19 Certificates: A Qualitative Study in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2020",2021-08-17,"BACKGROUND: Hand hygiene is an efficacious behaviour to prevent community-associated infections. Estimates of the proportion of populations who wash their hands have indicated limited compliance. While biases of self-report items for hand hygiene, such as the tendency to overestimate one's behaviour, represent a limitation, direct survey questions remain important. This study aims to compare indices of handwashing compliance based on single vs. combined handwashing attributes, i.e., its frequency, technique, and duration. METHODS: Data of a representative survey on hygiene and infection control by the German Federal Centre for Health Education were analysed. In a cross-sectional, computer-assisted telephone interview design, the resident population in Germany aged 16–85 years was surveyed in 2012. For handwashing, duration, frequency in different situations, and technique (use of soap, washing interdigital spaces, and drying hands) were self-reported. Self-reports were rated as (non-)compliant based on national recommendations and combined into single- and multi-attribute indices. Use of hand disinfectants, recall of handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms, and socio-demographics were also assessed. In total, N = 4483 persons participated (response rate: 49.7%). Data were weighted to compensate for sampling bias and analysed by cross-tabulation and multiple logistic regression. Primarily due to missing data, the analysis was confined to N = 4093 respondents (i.e., 91%). RESULTS: Among women, the proportion of those who reported to wash hands “almost always” in at least seven of nine situations was 30.8% (men: 20.3%). In contrast, 51% of men reported always using soap, drying hands, and washing interdigital spaces (women: 43.5%; p < 0.001). Compliance based on indices that included “frequency” was higher in women by 5.2% for “frequency + technique” (17.6% vs. 12.4%), and 2.5% for “frequency + duration” (13.1% vs. 10.6%) and “frequency + duration + technique” (8.8% vs. 6.3%; p < 0.02). Socio-demographic differences were most consistent regarding higher compliance among healthcare workers. Finally, especially men recalling handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms had higher compliance than those with no recall, namely, for “frequency + technique” (15.4% vs. 10.6%; OR: 1.9), all three attributes (7.6% vs. 5.3%; OR = 1.7), and “technique” (56.9% vs. 47.7%; OR = 1.6). The highest odds ratio was noted for disinfectant use among men (OR = 2.5; 12.2% vs. 4.9%). DISCUSSION: While being representative for Germany, limitations include the survey's cross-sectionality, response rate, and the study representing the situation in 2012. Nonetheless, indices based on combined attributes allow better comparison to scarce compliance estimates for Germany based on observation. Socio-demographic differences add to existing evidence, e.g., higher compliance by healthcare workers. Finally, although reverse causation is possible, it is notable that although handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms focus on duration and technique, women recalling them reported higher frequency, and men more often report hand disinfectant use, suggesting possible carry-over effects. CONCLUSION: Self-reported handwashing compliance assessment may be improved by partitioning the behavioural domain into different attributes and using indices based on combinations of these.","Mardiko, Amelia A.; von Lengerke, Thomas",Int J Hyg Environ Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1438463920305368; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113590; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32889358/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463920305368,34

METHODS: Data was obtained retrospectively from 366 hemodynamically stable adult ED patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). Patients were categorized by largest occluded artery and aggregated into: ‘Require anti-coagulation’ (main, lobar, and segmental PE), ‘Does not require anti-coagulation’ (sub-segmental and No PE), ‘High risk of deterioration’ (main and lobar PE), and ‘Not high risk of deterioration’ (segmental, sub-segmental, and No PE) groups. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for 2 sample comparisons of median D-dimer concentrations. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was utilized to determine a D-dimer cut-off that could differentiate ‘Require anti-coagulation’ from ‘Does not require anti-coagulation’ and ‘High risk of deterioration’ from ‘Low risk of deterioration’ groups. RESULTS: The ‘Require anti-coagulation’ group had a maximum area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 at an age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off of 1540 with a specificity of 86% (95% CI, 81–91%), and sensitivity of 84% (79–90%). The ‘High risk of deterioration’ group had a maximum AUC of 0.93 at an age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off of 2500 with a specificity of 90% (85–93%) and sensitivity of 83% (77–90%). CONCLUSIONS: An age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off of 1540 ng/mL differentiates suspected PE patients requiring anti-coagulation from those not requiring anti-coagulation. A cut-off of 2500 differentiates those with high risk of clinical deterioration from those not at high risk of deterioration.

As children stayed at home with no physical activities, their weight may have increased. The purpose of this study was to examine the link between fast food, sugars, or soft drinks and the ongoing domestic lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. This phenomenon was studied in three different cities from three different countries (Saudi Arabia, Britain, and Turkey) from the perspective of children’s parents. The study sought to address three research questions regarding children’s well-being during the COVID-19 lockdown period. First, was children’s nutrition affected during this period? Second, did children's weight increase? Third, were there any statistically significant differences in children’s dietary patterns based on their gender and nationality? A questionnaire was administered to 330 parents of children aged four to seven years in the three targeted countries. The study found that most parents cared about their children's nutrition and prepared food at home (96.1%) during the lockdown. Sixty-three percent of parents indicated that children did not gain weight. Additionally, differences in children’s nutritional systems were found between Saudi and Turkish children; the nutritional system of the Turkish children was better than that of Saudi children during the lockdown.

Soft nanoparticles such as nanoliposomes are not efficient as CUR carriers, since crystalline CUR is expelled from them to physiological media. Nanostructures to efficiently trap and increase the aqueous solubility of CUR are needed to improve both oral or nebulized delivery of CUR. Here we showed that SRA1 targeted nanoarchaeosomes (nATC) [1:0.4 w:w:0.04] archaeolipids, tween 80 and CUR, 155 ± 16 nm sized of −20.7 ± 3.3 z potential, retained 0.22 mg CUR ± 0.09 per 12.9 mg lipids ± 4.0 (~600 μM CUR) in front to dilution, storage, and nebulization. Raman and fluorescence spectra and SAXS patterns were compatible with a mixture of enol and keto CUR tautomers trapped within the depths of nATC bilayer. Between 20 and 5 µg CUR/mL, nATC was endocytosed by THP1 and A549 liquid–liquid monolayers without noticeable cytotoxicity. Five micrograms of CUR/mL nATC nebulized on an inflamed air–liquid interface of A549 cells increased TEER, normalized the permeation of LY, and decreased il6, tnfα, and il8 levels. Overall, these results suggest the modified pharmacodynamics of CUR in nATC is useful for epithelia repair upon inflammatory damage, deserving further deeper exploration, particularly related to its targeting ability.","Altube, Maria Julia; Caimi, Lilen Ivonne; Huck-Iriart, Cristian; Morilla, Maria Jose; Romero, Eder Lilia",Pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13091331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34575407/,34
631266,More Caution Needed for Patients Recovered From COVID-19,2020-11-02,"Healthcare researchers have been working on mortality prediction for COVID-19 patients with differing levels of severity. A rapid and reliable clinical evaluation of disease intensity will assist in the allocation and prioritization of mortality mitigation resources. The novelty of the work proposed in this paper is an early prediction model of high mortality risk for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, which provides state-of-the-art performance, in an external validation cohort from a different population. Retrospective research was performed on two separate hospital datasets from two different countries for model development and validation. In the first dataset, COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were admitted to the emergency department in Boston (24 March 2020 to 30 April 2020), and in the second dataset, 375 COVID-19 patients were admitted to Tongji Hospital in China (10 January 2020 to 18 February 2020). The key parameters to predict the risk of mortality for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were identified and a nomogram-based scoring technique was developed using the top-ranked five parameters. Age, Lymphocyte count, D-dimer, CRP, and Creatinine (ALDCC), information acquired at hospital admission, were identified by the logistic regression model as the primary predictors of hospital death. For the development cohort, and internal and external validation cohorts, the area under the curves (AUCs) were 0.987, 0.999, and 0.992, respectively. All the patients are categorized into three groups using ALDCC score and death probability: Low (probability < 5%), Moderate (5% < probability < 50%), and High (probability > 50%) risk groups.

We aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial/ethnic groups in the United States (US) and to assess the effects of social distancing, social vulnerability metrics, and medical disparities. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted utilizing data from the COVID-19 Tracking Project and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Demographic data were obtained from the US Census Bureau, social vulnerability data were obtained from the CDC, social distancing data were obtained from Unacast, and medical disparities data from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. A comparison of proportions by Fisher’s exact test was used to evaluate differences between death rates stratified by age. Negative binomial regression analysis was used to predict COVID-19 deaths based on social distancing scores, social vulnerability metrics, and medical disparities. RESULTS: COVID-19 cumulative infection and death rates were higher among minority racial/ethnic groups than whites across many states. Older age was also associated with increased cumulative death rates across all racial/ethnic groups on a national level, and many minority racial/ethnic groups experienced significantly greater cumulative death rates than whites within age groups ≥ 35 years. All studied racial/ethnic groups experienced higher hospitalization rates than whites. Older persons (≥ 65 years) also experienced more COVID-19 deaths associated with comorbidities than younger individuals. Social distancing factors, several measures of social vulnerability, and select medical disparities were identified as being predictive of county-level COVID-19 deaths. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted many racial/ethnic minority communities across the country, warranting further research and intervention.","Boserup, Brad; McKenney, Mark; Elkbuli, Adel",Am Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33231496/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0003134820973356,34

The key challenge for achieving effective gene silencing in particular for the purpose of the therapeutics is primarily dependent on the effectiveness and specificity of the RNAi targeting sequence. However, only a limited number of siRNAs is capable of inducing highly effective and sequence-specific gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism. In addition, the efficacy of siRNA-induced gene silencing can only be experimentally measured based on inhibition of the target gene expression. Therefore, it is important to establish a fully robust and comparative validating system for determining the efficacy of designed siRNAs. In this study, we have developed a reliable and quantitative reporter-based siRNA validation system that consists of a short synthetic DNA fragment containing an RNAi targeting sequence of interest and two expression vectors for targeting reporter and triggering siRNA expression. The efficacy of the siRNAs is measured by their abilities to inhibit expression of the targeting reporter gene with easily quantified readouts including enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) and firefly luciferase. Using fully analyzed siRNAs against human hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) and tumor suppressor protein p53, we have demonstrated that this system could effectively and faithfully report the efficacy of the corresponding siRNAs. In addition, we have further applied this system for screening and identification of the highly effective siRNAs that could specifically inhibit expression of mouse matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), and human serine/threonine kinase AKT1. Since only a readily available short synthetic DNA fragment is needed for constructing this novel reporter-based siRNA validation system, this system not only provides a powerful strategy for screening highly effective siRNAs but also implicates in the use of RNAi for studying novel gene function in mammals.","Hung, Chuan-Fu; Lu, Kuang-Chu; Cheng, Tsung-Lin; Wu, Ren-Huang; Huang, Lin-Ya; Teng, Chiao-Fang; Chang, Wen-Tsan",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X06012162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16793020/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X06012162,34

The patient was treated with intensive induction chemotherapy and we characterize the subsequent outbreak of COVID‐19 on a LSCT‐Unit. We describe the characteristics of the 36 contacts among the medical team, the results of their PCR and antibody tests and clinical aspects and features of infected employees. Of these 36 close contacts, 9 employees of the LSCT‐Unit were infected and were tested positive by PCR and/or antibody‐testing. 8/9 of them were symptomatic, 3/9 with severe, 5/9 with mild symptoms, and one person without symptoms. Due to stringent hygiene measures, the outbreak did not lead to infections of other patients despite ongoing clinical work. Moreover, we demonstrate that incubation period and clinical course of a COVID‐19 infection in an immunosuppressed patient could be unusual compared to that of immunocompetent patients. Consistent PCR and antibody testing are helpful to understand, control, and prevent outbreaks. For the safety of health‐care workers and patients alike, all employees wore FFP2 masks and were trained to adhere to several further safety guidelines.

We aim ascertaining whether respiratory system static compliance (Crs), driving pressure (DP), and tidal volume normalized for ideal body weight (VT/kg IBW) at the 1st day of controlled mechanical ventilation are associated with intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in COVID-19 ARDS. METHODS: Observational multicenter cohort study. All consecutive COVID-19 adult patients admitted to 25 ICUs belonging to the COVID-19 VENETO ICU network (February 28th–April 28th, 2020), who received controlled mechanical ventilation, were screened. Only patients fulfilling ARDS criteria and with complete records of Crs, DP and VT/kg IBW within the 1st day of controlled mechanical ventilation were included. Crs, DP and VT/kg IBW were collected in sedated, paralyzed and supine patients. RESULTS: A total of 704 COVID-19 patients were screened and 241 enrolled. Seventy-one patients (29%) died in ICU. The logistic regression analysis showed that: (1) Crs was not linearly associated with ICU mortality (p value for nonlinearity = 0.01), with a greater risk of death for values < 48 ml/cmH(2)O; (2) the association between DP and ICU mortality was linear (p value for nonlinearity = 0.68), and increasing DP from 10 to 14 cmH(2)O caused significant higher odds of in-ICU death (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.06–1.99); (3) VT/kg IBW was not associated with a significant increase of the risk of death (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.55–1.52). Multivariable analysis confirmed these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Crs < 48 ml/cmH(2)O was associated with ICU mortality, while DP was linearly associated with mortality. DP should be kept as low as possible, even in the case of relatively preserved Crs, irrespective of VT/kg IBW, to reduce the risk of death.

Here, we use a novel range-wide dataset comprised 48 810 surveys to quantify how sea star wasting disease affected Pycnopodia helianthoides, the sunflower sea star, across its range from Baja California, Mexico to the Aleutian Islands, USA. We found that the outbreak occurred more rapidly, killed a greater percentage of the population and left fewer survivors in the southern half of the species's range. Pycnopodia now appears to be functionally extinct (greater than 99.2% declines) from Baja California, Mexico to Cape Flattery, Washington, USA and exhibited severe declines (greater than 87.8%) from the Salish Sea to the Gulf of Alaska. The importance of temperature in predicting Pycnopodia distribution rose more than fourfold after the outbreak, suggesting latitudinal variation in outbreak severity may stem from an interaction between disease severity and warmer waters. We found no evidence of population recovery in the years since the outbreak. Natural recovery in the southern half of the range is unlikely over the short term. Thus, assisted recovery will probably be required to restore the functional role of this predator on ecologically relevant time scales.","Hamilton, S. L.; Saccomanno, V. R.; Heady, W. N.; Gehman, A.

Even if this targeted therapy is highly effective at suppressing viral replication, caregivers are facing growing therapeutic failures in patients due to resistance, with or without treatment-adherence glitches. Accordingly, it is important to better understand how HIV and other retroviruses replicate in order to propose alternative antiviral strategies. Recent studies have shown that multiple cellular factors are implicated during the integration step and, more specifically, that integrase can be regulated through post-translational modifications. We have shown that integrase is phosphorylated by GCN2, a cellular protein kinase of the integrated stress response, leading to a restriction of HIV replication. In addition, we found that this mechanism is conserved among other retroviruses. Accordingly, we developed an in vitro interaction assay, based on the AlphaLISA technology, to monitor the integrase-GCN2 interaction. From an initial library of 133 FDA-approved molecules, we identified nine compounds that either inhibited or stimulated the interaction between GCN2 and HIV integrase. In vitro characterization of these nine hits validated this pilot screen and demonstrated that the GCN2-integrase interaction could be a viable solution for targeting integrase out of its active site.","Torres, Chloé; Garling, Asja; Taouji, Saïd; Calmels, Christina; Andreola, Marie-Line; Métifiot, Mathieu",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26175423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34500856/,34

Autopsy can considerably contribute to our understanding of many disease processes and could provide crucial information to guide management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We report on the relevant cardiopulmonary findings in, to our knowledge, the first autopsy series of ten African American decedents, with the cause of death attributed to COVID-19. METHODS: Autopsies were performed on ten African American decedents aged 44–78 years with cause of death attributed to COVID-19, reflective of the dominant demographic of deaths following COVID-19 diagnosis in New Orleans. Autopsies were done with consent of the decedents' next of kin. Pulmonary and cardiac features were examined, with relevant immunostains to characterise the inflammatory response, and RNA labelling and electron microscopy on representative sections. FINDINGS: Important findings include the presence of thrombosis and microangiopathy in the small vessels and capillaries of the lungs, with associated haemorrhage, that significantly contributed to death. Features of diffuse alveolar damage, including hyaline membranes, were present, even in patients who had not been ventilated. Cardiac findings included individual cell necrosis without lymphocytic myocarditis. There was no evidence of secondary pulmonary infection by microorganisms. INTERPRETATION: We identify key pathological states, including thrombotic and microangiopathic pathology in the lungs, that contributed to death in patients with severe COVID-19 and decompensation in this demographic. Management of these patients should include treatment to target these pathological mechanisms.

The disease, was first described in Wuhan at the end of 2019 and the first case in Switzerland was discovered in February 2020. This analysis gives an overview of dialysis patients in Switzerland that were tested COVID-19 positive. METHOD: All dialysis centers reported their cases with COVID-19 to the Swiss dialysis registry srrqap. All patients reported to the registry between March 5 (1st dialysis patient with COVID-19) and June 30, 2020 were included in this analysis and comparisons were made with COVID-19-free dialysis patients (from 2019). RESULTS: On March 5, 2020, the first dialysis patient was infected with COVID-19 in Ticino. The number of infected dialysis patients increased rapidly over the months of March and April, with the majority of patients in the cantons of Vaud (23.5%), Ticino (22.3%) and Geneva (18.8%) and together making up almost 65% of the COVID-19-infected dialysis patients in Switzerland. COVID-19 cases represented 2.4% of all prevalent patients on dialysis (as of 31.12.2019). Twenty-seven (12 female, 15 male) out of 93 dialysis patients died, which corresponds to a mortality rate of 29%. Mortality was highest in patients from Switzerland (together with the Netherlands), and lowest in Romania with 8.5% (K. Jager and A. Kramer, submitted for publication, 2020). Mortality was associated with advanced age in dialysis patients. In contrast to the general population, male sex, diabetes and hypertension were no major risk factors for mortality in our cohort. CONCLUSION: Although dialysis patients from Switzerland in general have a better survival compared to those from other European countries, infection with COVID-19 in Switzerland results in the highest mortality compared to other European countries in this population. In addition, male sex, diabetes and hypertension seem not to be associated risk factors in our dialysis population.","Winzeler, Rebecca; Ambühl, Patrice Max",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab098.0036,34

All samples were positive for IgGs against the S- and N-proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Notably, 14 samples available at 6–7 months post-infection all showed significant neutralizing activities in a pseudovirus assay, with no difference in blocking the cell-entry of the 614D and 614G variants of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, in 10 blood samples from cases at 6–7 months post-infection used for memory T-cell tests, we found that interferon γ-producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells were increased upon SARS-CoV-2 antigen stimulation. Together, these results indicate that durable anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity is common in convalescent population, and vaccines developed from 614D variant may offer protection from the currently predominant 614D variant of SARS-CoV-2.","Tan, Yun; Liu, Feng; Xu, Xiaoguang; Ling, Yun; Huang, Weijin; Zhu, Zhaoqin; Guo, Mingquan; Lin, Yixiao; Fu, Ziyu; Liang, Dongguo; Zhang, Tengfei; Fan, Jian; Xu, Miao; Lu, Hongzhou; Chen, Saijuan",Front Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11684-020-0822-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33017040/,34

No research has addressed the development of mobile applications for the clinical evaluation and diagnosis of paediatric language disorders. PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the usability of a clinical assessment mobile application (app) prototype, the “Paediatric Arabic Language Test” (PALT), to diagnose language disorders among paediatric patients. METHODS: Using the Lewis Computer Software Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ) and a 5-point Likert Scale, data was collected and scored on the usability of the app prototype developed on two mobile platforms- iPhone and iPad- across a general operating system, iOS. A sample of 77 potential end-users rated the usability of the app prototype that they used between 2017 and 2019. RESULTS: The average CSUQ rating for the app prototype was 75.68 and 53.2% strongly agreed that the information and its organization was clear and easy to understand; 75% of the end users were very satisfied (p < 0.0001). Out of the total items, 68% of studied items on the scale loaded on factor 1 even after subjecting the scale to three standardization methods. CONCLUSION: The prototype design was judged to be usable. Users reported an effective user interface that allows effective operation. Differences in the factor loading may be explained by cultural factors, type of task and field context.","Alabdulkarim, Lamya",Saudi J Biol Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.04.046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34354434/,34

An optimal tax strategy was formulated that not only could lower drug prices and improve public health and welfare, but also considers companies’ earnings. The strategy was based on the Stackelberg game theory as a bi-level mathematical model. In the model, the government is the leader, with patient satisfaction as the main goal, and pharmaceutical companies are the followers, with maximum drug revenue as the goal. The results show that under the premise of ensuring sufficient incentives for patent holders, the optimized tax on excess profit can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of pharmaceutical patent protection, alleviate the failure of market regulation of drug prices, improve patient satisfaction, and increase total social welfare.","Xu, Chunming; Zhu, Debao",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33513961/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18031119,34
645779,Telemedicine Utilization Trends During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency,2021,"BACKGROUND: Globally, the threat of infectious diseases, particularly emerging infectious diseases, originating at the human-animal-environment interface, has caught health systems off guard. With forecasts that future pathogen emergence will be centred in hotspots in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the need to prepare policy frameworks that can combat this threat is urgent. DISCUSSION: Emergence of diseases such as avian influenza and Ebola virus disease, which threatened social disruption, have established the need for intersectoral coordination/collaboration. These events led to the initiation of establishing institutionalised collaborative frameworks in India to adopt a One Health approach to disease prevention and control. However, the gains made in influenza control could not be adapted to other infectious diseases. Intersectoral coordination was briefly carried out, more as a reactive response to threats. The systemic failure to sustain such efforts have therefore, only undermined a coordinated response. The recent draft National Health Policy, 2015, has also failed to establish the need for intersectoral coordination in disease control approaches. Neglecting the need to endorse linkages between human health, animal health and husbandry, agriculture, and environmental sectors, has led to duplicative and weak response systems. The absence of health impact assessment with respect to the development agenda in policies, has cast negative effects on the health and wellbeing of man, animal, and the environment. Lack of attention to building core capacity in these critical sectors has further raised challenges in designing and deploying mitigation strategies. With developing countries like India being home to a major portion of the world’s poorest livestock farmers, the absence of a policy discourse that endorses the One Health approach in development and health policies is a major hurdle in eliminating poverty and poverty-related diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of One Health approaches in health and related sectoral policies is a critical policy requirement for India and other developing countries. The goal should be to not just establish preparedness plans, but also to encourage a policy environment where assessment and mitigation of downstream impacts of different agenda are incorporated.

DESIGN: This study is a longitudinal study from 24 January 2020 to 28 February 2020. METHODS: There are 71 nursing staff working in the emergency isolation wards of Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital that participated in this study. The questionnaires were conducted with Likert scale. The operation assessment teachers have received standardized training. The self‐rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self‐rating depression Scale (SDS) were applied to assess the mental state of nurses. RESULTS: After short‐term training, these nurses can handle the emergency tasks in a timely manner. The pass rate of nurse theory and operation assessment is 100%. The 111 suspected patients admitted to the emergency isolation ward have been scientifically diagnosed and treated, the three confirmed patients have received appropriate treatment. No nurses have been infected. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the personalized emergency training mode was feasible in the emergency isolation ward during the COVID‐19 epidemic, which rapidly improved the rescue ability of nurses and effectively avoid the occurrence of cross‐infection. This mode can provide a valuable reference for the emergency training of nurses in the future.","Zhou, Min; Yuan, Fei; Zhao, Xiaolong; Xi, Fanjie; Wen, Xianxiu; Zeng, Li; Zeng, Wenbo; Wu, Haiyan; Zeng, Hui; Zhao, Ziyu",Nurs Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837736/; https://doi.org/10.1002/nop2.580,34

Our aim is to evaluate the impact of GV on acute ischemic stroke (IS) outcomes in humans and explore the impact of two different insulin administration routes on GV in an animal model. METHODS: This translational study consists of two studies conducted in parallel: The first study is an observational, multicenter, prospective clinical study in which 340 patients with acute IS will be subcutaneously implanted a sensor to continuously monitor blood glucose levels for 96 h. The second study is a basic experimental study using an animal model (rats) with permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and induced hyperglycemia (through an intraperitoneal injection of nicotinamide and streptozotocin). The animal study will include the following 6 groups (10 animals per group): sham; hyperglycemia without IS; IS without hyperglycemia; IS and hyperglycemia without treatment; IS and hyperglycemia and intravenous insulin; and IS and hyperglycemia and subcutaneous insulin. The endpoint for the first study is mortality at 3 months, while the endpoints for the animal model study are GV, functional recovery and biomarkers.

This study evaluated students’ experience in the course, the curriculum content and format, and its short-term impact on students’ knowledge and attitudes around COVID-19. METHODS: Students responded to discussion board prompts throughout the course and submitted pre−/post-course reflections. Pre−/post-course questionnaires assessed pandemic knowledge and attitudes using 4-point Likert scales. Authors collected aggregate data on enrollment, discussion posts, field placements, and scholarly work resulting from course activities. After the elective, authors conducted a focus group with a convenience sample of 6 participants. Institutional elective evaluation data was included in analysis. Authors analyzed questionnaire data with summary statistics and paired t-tests comparing knowledge and attitudes before and after the elective. Reflection pieces, discussion posts, and focus group data were analyzed using content analysis with a phenomenological approach. RESULTS: Twenty-seven students enrolled. Each student posted an average of 2.4 original discussion posts and 3.1 responses. Mean knowledge score increased from 43.8 to 60.8% (p < 0.001) between pre- and post-course questionnaires. Knowledge self-assessment also increased (2.4 vs. 3.5 on Likert scale, p < 0.0001), and students reported increased engagement in the pandemic response (2.7 vs. 3.6, p < 0.0001). Students reported increased fluency in discussing the pandemic and increased appreciation for the field of public health. There was no difference in students’ level of anxiety about the pandemic after course participation (3.0 vs. 3.1, p = 0.53). Twelve students (44.4%) completed the institutional evaluation. All rated the course “very good” or “excellent.” Students favorably reviewed the field placements, suggested readings, self-directed research, and learning from peers. They suggested more clearly defined expectations and improved balance between volunteer and educational hours. CONCLUSIONS: The elective was well-received by students, achieved stated objectives, and garnered public attention. Course leadership should monitor students’ time commitment closely in service-learning settings to ensure appropriate balance of service and education. Student engagement in a disaster response is insufficient to address anxiety related to the disaster; future course iterations should include a focus on self-care during times of crisis.

The purpose of this study was to examine how municipalities in one Finnish region promote mental health, with a focus on the promotion of children’s mental health. METHODS: Document analysis was used as a research method. Documents were selected for a one-year period (2018) from three municipalities of the North Savo region. Analysed documents (n=269) were municipal strategies, programmes and plans, as well as meeting minutes of municipal councils, boards and committees. Eight domains of the structural indicators of mental health were used as an analysis frame. RESULTS: In total, 1169 mentions related to the structural indicators of mental health were found in the documents. In strategies, programmes and plans, parenting-related mentions were found most often. Regarding the minutes, the issues discussed and reported about the wellbeing of children focused on practical issues, such as the construction of day care buildings. CONCLUSIONS: Document analysis indicated that mental health promotion involved mostly the society and environment and not as much the age and setting.

METHODS: Literature related to pathology education, pathology services in low-resource settings, and application of digital tools to pathology education was reviewed for trends and training gaps. Publications covering pathology manpower and cancer incidence worldwide were also included to assess needs. RESULTS: Pandemic-related virtual teaching has produced abundant online training materials. Pathology learning resources in low- to middle-income countries remain considerably constrained and dampen pathology manpower growth to meet current needs. Projected increases in disease burden toward the developing world thus pose a major challenge. Digital pathology resources have expanded and are beginning to appear beyond the developed countries. CONCLUSIONS: This circumstance offers a unique opportunity to leverage digital teaching resources to enhance and equitize training internationally, potentially sufficient to meet the rising wave of noncommunicable diseases. We propose four next steps to take advantage of the current opportunity: curate and organize digital training materials, invest in the digital pathology infrastructure for education and clinical care, expand student exposure to pathology through virtual electives, and develop further competency-based certification pathways.","Hassell, Lewis A; Afzal, Anoshia",Am J Clin Pathol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcp/aqab034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33978156/,34

In April 2009, an elementary school outbreak of pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza was reported in a community in northern British Columbia, Canada-an area that includes both non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal residents living on or off a reserve. During the outbreak investigation, we explored the relationship between prior receipt of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and pH1N1-related illness. Methods. A telephone survey was conducted from 15 May through 5 June 2009 among households of children attending any school in the affected community. Members of participating households where influenza-like illness (ILI) was described were then invited to submit blood samples for confirmation of pH1N1 infection by hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization assays. Circulation of pH1N1 was concentrated among households of the elementary school and elsewhere on-reserve to which analyses of TIV effect were thus restricted. Odds ratios (ORs) for the TIV effect on ILI were computed through logistic regression, with adjustment for age, comorbidity, household density, and Aboriginal status. The influence of within-household clustering was assessed through generalized-linear-mixed models. Results. Of 408 participants, 92 (23%) met ILI criteria: 29 (32%) of 92 persons with ILI, compared with 61 (19%) 316 persons without ILI, had received the 2008–2009 formulation of TIV. Fully adjusted ORs for 2008- 2009 TIV effect on ILI were 2.45 (95% confidence interval, 1.34–4.48) by logistic regression and 2.68 [95% confidence interval, 1.37–5.25) by generalized-linear-mixed model. Conclusions. An outbreak investigation in British Columbia during the late spring of 2009 provided the first indication of an unexpected association between receipt of TIV and pH1N1 illness. This led to 5 additional studies through the summer 2009 in Canada, each of which corroborated these initial findings.","Janjua, Naveed Z.; Skowronski, Danuta M.; Hottes, Travis S.; Osei, William; Adams, Evan; Petric, Martin; Sabaiduc, Suzana; Chan, Tracy; Mak, Annie; Lem, Marcus; Tang, Patrick; Patrick, David M.; De Serres, Gaston; Bowering, David",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1086/656586; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20887210/,34

Because of the increasing prevalence of IBD in newly industrialized countries such as those in Asia, the Middle East, and South America, there is mounting interest in elucidating the gut microbiota of these populations. We present a comprehensive analysis of several IBD-related biomarkers and gut microbiota profiles and functions of a unique population of patients with IBD and healthy patients from Kazan (Republic of Tatarstan, Russia). METHODS: Blood and fecal IBD biomarkers, serum cytokines, and fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content were profiled. Finally, fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S and whole-genome shotgun sequencing. RESULTS: Fecal microbiota whole-genome sequencing confirmed the presence of classic IBD dysbiotic features at the phylum level, with increased abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria and decreased abundance of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia. At the genus level, the abundance of both fermentative (SCFA-producing and hydrogen (H(2))-releasing) and hydrogenotrophic (H(2)-consuming) microbes was affected in patients with IBD. This imbalance was confirmed by the decreased abundance of SCFA species in the feces of patients with IBD and the change in anaerobic index, which mirrors the redox status of the intestine. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses highlighted how IBD-related dysbiotic microbiota—which are generally mainly linked to SCFA imbalance—may affect other important metabolic pathways, such as H(2) metabolism, that are critical for host physiology and disease development.","Lo Sasso, Giuseppe; Khachatryan, Lusine; Kondylis, Athanasios; Battey, James N D; Sierro, Nicolas; Danilova, Natalia A; Grigoryeva, Tatiana V; Markelova, Maria I; Khusnutdinova, Dilyara R; Laikov, Alexander V; Salafutdinov, Ilnur I; Romanova, Yulia D; Siniagina, Mariia N; Vasiliev, Ilya Yu; Boulygina, Eugenia A; Solovyeva, Valeriya V; Garanina, Ekaterina E; Kitaeva, Kristina V; Ivanov, Konstantin Y; Chulpanova, Darja S; Kletenkov, Konstantin S; Valeeva, Alina R; Odintsova, Alfiya Kh; Ardatskaya, Maria D; Abdulkhakov, Rustam A; Ivanov, Nikolai V; Peitsch, Manuel C; Hoeng, Julia; Abdulkhakov, Sayar R",Inflamm Bowel Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32766755/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ibd/izaa188,34

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (Mpro) is a chymotrypsin-type cysteine protease that is needed to produce functional proteins essential for virus replication and transcription. Serpin traps its target proteases by presenting a reactive center loop (RCL) as protease-specific cleavage site, resulting in protease inactivation. Mpro target sites with its active site serine and other flanking residues can possibly interact with serpins. Alternatively, RCL cleavage site of serpins with known evidence of inhibition of cysteine proteases can be replaced by Mpro target site to make chimeric proteins. Purified chimeric serpin can possibly inhibit Mpro that can be assessed indirectly by observing the decrease in ability of Mpro to cleave its chromogenic substrate.

665885,Overcoming a Pandemic:: How Engineering and Modeling Techniques Are Used to Inform a Health System From Preparation to Recovery from the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-08-13,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic poses a major burden to the healthcare system in Egypt, and in the face of a highly infective disease which can prove fatal, healthcare systems need to change their management protocols to meet these new challenges. MAIN BODY: This scientific statement, developed by the cardiology department at Cairo University, emphasized 6 different aspects that are intended to guide healthcare providers during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlighted the importance of dealing with all cardiac arrest victims, during the pandemic, as potential COVID-19 cases, and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) by health care providers during the procedure. It also stated that the CPR procedure should be done in a separate room with the door closed and that the number of providers present during the procedure should be limited to only those who are essential for patient resuscitation. It also stressed that family members and accompanying personnel of patients with possible COVID-19 should not be in the vicinity of CPR site. The statement also pointed out that CPR procedure should be done in the standard manner with precautions to minimize spread of infection to the staff and accompanying people. Early intubation was prioritized, and the use of rapid sequence intubation with appropriate PPE was recommended. For delivery of CPR for the prone ventilated patient, delivery of chest compressions by pressing the patient’s back, while a team prepares to turn the patient supine, was recommended. During intra-hospital transport, it was emphasized that the receiving intensive care unit (ICU) should be notified about the possibility of the patient being COVID-19 positive, so that appropriate infection control precautions are taken. CONCLUSION: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation of cardiac arrest patients in the COVID-19 era poses a significant challenge, and all health care providers should deal with any cardiac arrest victim presenting to the emergency department as potential COVID-19 suspects and should use the appropriate PPE.","Taha, Hesham S.; Shaker, Mirna M.; Abdelghany, Mohamed M.",Egypt Heart J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43044-020-00106-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33108568/,34

This infection affects respiratory system and provides uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response as cytokine storm. The main concern about SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is high viral pathogenicity with no specific drugs. MicroRNAs (miRs) as small non-coding RNAs (21–25 nt) regulate gene expression. The SARS-CoV-2 encoded-miRs affect human genes that involved in transcription, translation, apoptosis, immune response and inflammation. Also, they alter self-gene regulation and hijacked host miRs that provide protective environment to maintain its latency. On the other hand, Host miRs play critical role in viral gene expression to restrict infection. Over expression/inhibition of miRs might result in cell cycle irregularity, impaired immune response or cancer. In this manner, exact role of each miR should be specified. Mimic encoded-miRs like antagomirs showed successful result in phases of clinical trial prevent from negative effects of viral encoded-miRs. Products of mimic miRs are inexpensive corresponds to synthesis of primer; they are short and nanoscale in size. Although SARS-CoV-2 genome is undergoing evaluation, detection of exact molecular pathogenesis open up opportunities to for vaccine development. Salivaomics can evaluate SARS-CoV-2 genome, transcriptome, proteome and biomarkers like miRs in oral related and cancer disease. In this review, we studied the challenge and opportunities of miRs in therapeutic approach for SARS-CoV-2 infection, then overviewed the role of miRs in saliva droplet during SARS-CoV-2 infection and related cancer.","Farshbaf, Alieh; Mohtasham, Nooshin; Zare, Reza; Mohajertehran, Farnaz; Rezaee, Seyed Abdolrahim",J Oral Biol Craniofac Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212426820301986?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398242/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobcr.2020.12.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212426820301986,34

However, the ability to understand the effectiveness of such events at influencing conservation behavior is confounded by the likelihood that attendees are already interested in conservation and may already be adopters. Understanding characteristics of events that draw non-adopters can aid in designing events and messaging that are better able to reach beyond those already interested in conservation. METHODS: For this study, we interviewed 101 operators of private agricultural lands in Maryland, USA, and used descriptive statistics and qualitative comparative analysis to investigate differences between the kinds of outreach events that adopters and non-adopters attended. RESULTS: Our results suggested that non-adopters, as compared to adopters, attended events that provided production-relevant information and were logistically easy to attend. Further, non-adopters were more selective when reading advertisements, generally preferring simplicity. Future research and outreach can build on these findings by experimentally testing the effectiveness of messages that are simple and relevant to farmers’ production priorities.","Read, Daniel J.; Carroll, Alexandra; Wainger, Lisa A.",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540362/,34

Saudi Arabia was among the first countries to enforce restriction measures such as closing schools, remote working, and a travel ban. We aim to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people’s depression in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional online survey of 1109 participants was conducted during the curfew between 18th of May and 11th of June 2020. An online questionnaire included questions about the commitment to follow the precautionary measures, knowledge on COVID-19, and depression. Depression was assessed with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised method. Females, unmarried individuals, elderly persons, parents of young children, unemployed, and small families were more likely to be depressed. Education level did not explain the differences in depression. However, the more knowledge the participants had about COVID-19 the better they followed the restrictions.

A total of 25 calves divided into two groups. Sepsis group was composed of 15 newborn calves aged 0–10 days which met neonatal sepsis criteria, but did not receive any treatment. Control group included 10 healthy calves aged 0–10 days. Clinical examinations (respiratory rate, rectal temperature, heart rate, capillary refill time, sucking reflex) were performed at certain times before (0th h) and during (12th, 24th, 48th, and 72th h) the treatment. The blood was taken from the jugular vein from the sepsis group before (0th h) and during the treatment (12th, 24th, 48th, and 72nd h) and once from the control group. Procalcitonin pretreatment (0th h) and control group concentrations were found as 178.08 ± 2.4 (pg/mL) and 42.78 ± 1.25 (pg/mL), respectively (p < 0.001). Neopterin pretreatment (0th h) and control group concentrations were determined as 14.44 ± 0.30 (ng/mL) and 3.63 ± 0.29 (ng/mL), respectively (p < 0.001). As a result, neopterin and procalcitonin concentration decreased along with the treatment, confirming the presence of sepsis in calves and suggesting that sepsis could be a prognostic indicator. Therefore, both procalcitonin and neopterin can be prognostic and diagnostic in calves with sepsis.","Akyüz, Enes; Gökce, Gürbüz",Trop Anim Health Prod,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34106342/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-021-02779-z,34
668760,The Relationship Between the Global Burden of Influenza From 2017 to 2019 and COVID-19: Descriptive Epidemiological Assessment,2021-03-02,"ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a surge in demand for N95 or equivalent respirators that the global supply chain was unable to satisfy. This shortage in critical equipment has inspired research that addresses the immediate problems and has accelerated the development of the next-generation filtration media and respirators. This article provides a brief review of the most recent work with regard to face respirators and filtration media. We discuss filtration efficiency of the widely utilized cloth masks. Next, the sterilization of and reuse of existing N95 respirators to extend the existing stockpile is discussed. To expand near-term supplies, optimization of current manufacturing methods, such as melt-blown processes and electrospinning, has been explored. Future manufacturing methods have been investigated to address long-term supply shortages. Novel materials with antiviral and sterilizable properties with the ability for multiple reuses have been developed and will contribute to the development of the next generation of longer lasting multi-use N95 respirators. Finally, additively manufactured respirators are reviewed, which enable a rapidly deployable source of reusable respirators that can use any filtration fabric.

669274,Socio-demographic disparities in the eating behaviour of Malaysian children during the COVID-19 lockdown,2021-05-25,"Background Burnout has been linked to poor job satisfaction, increased medical errors, and is prevalent among healthcare professionals. We sought to characterize burnout and distress among US cardiothoracic surgical (CTS) trainees. Methods A 19-question survey was sent to CTS trainees in collaboration with the Thoracic Surgery Residents Association. We queried sociodemographic variables, balance/quality of life (QOL), and indicators of depression and regret. We included questions along the emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment subscales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Results The survey was sent to 531 CTS trainees across 76 institutions and there were 108 responses (20.3%). Over 50% of respondents expressed dissatisfaction with balance in their professional life and over 40% screened positively for signs of depression. Over 25% (n=28) of respondents would not complete CTS training again, given a choice. More than half met criteria for burnout on emotional exhaustion and depersonalization subscales. CTS residents with children were more likely to express regret towards pursuing CTS training. A greater proportion of women than men reported poor levels of balance/QOL during training as measured by missed health appointments, negative impact on relationships, and self-perception. Similarly, those in the final three years of training were more likely to report poor levels of balance/QOL. Conclusions High rates of burnout, regret, and depression are present among US CTS trainees. Efforts to promote trainee well-being and implement interventions that support those at high risk for burnout are warranted, to benefit trainees as well as the patients they serve.","Chow, Oliver S.; Sudarshan, Monisha; Maxfield, Mark W.; Seese, Laura M.; Watkins, Ammara A.; Fleishman, Aaron; Gangadharan, Sidhu P.",Ann Thorac Surg,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003497520313588?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32866478/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003497520313588; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.06.062,34
669511,Nowhere to Go: Parents' Descriptions of Children's Physical Activity During a Global Pandemic,2021-04-26,"OBJECTIVES: The collateral effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on interventional stroke care is not well described. We studied this effect by utilizing stroke device sales data as markers of interventional stroke case volume in the United States. METHODS: Using a real-time healthcare device sales registry, this observational study examined trends in the sales of thrombectomy devices and cerebral aneurysm coiling from the same 945 reporting hospitals in the U.S. between January 22 and June 31, 2020, and for the same months in 2018 and 2019 to allow for comparison. We simultaneously reviewed daily reports of new COVID-19 cases. The strength of association between the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 and procedural device sales was measured using Spearman rank correlation coefficient (CC). RESULTS: Device sales decreased for thrombectomy (-3.7%) and cerebral aneurysm coiling (-8.5%) when comparing 2019 to 2020. In 2020, thrombectomy device sales were negatively associated with the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (CC -0.56, p < 0.0001), with stronger negative correlation during April (CC -0.97, p < 0.0001). The same negative correlation was observed with aneurysm treatment devices (CC -0.60, p < 0.001), with stronger correlation in April (CC -0.97, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The decline in sales of stroke interventional equipment underscores a decline in associated case volumes. Future pandemic responses should consider strategies to mitigate such negative collateral effects.","Adapa, Arjun Rohit; Jumaa, Mouhammad A.; Siddiqui, Fazeel M.; Dawod, Giana; Zaidat, Osama O.; Gurm, Hitinder S.; Pandey, Aditya S.",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2021.106931; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303846721004601?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34517166/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303846721004601,34

This deficit has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as the need for social distancing and the introduction of hybrid staffing models have decreased the critical educational interactions at the reading room workstations between staff and trainees. By leveraging interactive, case-based learning, educators have the opportunity to bridge the substantial gap between basic pattern recognition and successfully making a diagnosis in independent practice. For the educator, this signals a shift away from perfect case selection and presenter authority, and toward the role of a guide facilitating an active case-based learning experience. This form of learning is best accompanied by guided interpretation and iterative feedback with the goal of developing similar levels of mastery and autonomy among graduating trainees. In this article, we present the tools and methods for incorporating interactive cases into existing and novel teaching materials to meet the unique challenges educators are facing today.

671182,Effect of socioeconomic inequalities and vulnerabilities on health-system preparedness and response to COVID-19 in Brazil: a comprehensive analysis,2021-04-12,"Currently, the novel coronavirus pneumonia has been widespread globally, and there is no specific medicine. In response to the emergency, we employed bioinformatics methods to investigate the virus's pathogenic mechanism, finding possible control methods. We speculated in previous studies that E protein was associated with viral infectivity. The present study adopted the domain search techniques to analyse the E protein. According to the results, the E protein could bind iron or haem. The iron and haem bound by the E protein came from the attacked haemoglobin and phagocytes. When E protein was attached to haem, it synthesised oxygen and water into superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. When the iron-bound E protein and the haem-bound E protein worked together, they converted superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. These were the “ROS attack” and “ROS escape” of the virus. “ROS attack” damaged the tissues or cells exposed on the surface of the virus, and “ROS escape” decomposed the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide that attacked the virus. When NK cells were exposed to infected cells, viruses that had not shed from the infected cells’ surface damaged them through “ROS attack”. In addition, lymphocytes such as T cells and B cells, which could be close to the antigen of the virus surface, were also easily damaged or killed by the ""ROS attack"", generating a decrease in lymphocytes. When memory B cells were exposed to the virus’s surface antigen, they were also damaged by “ROS attack”, resulting in the patient's re-infection. The virus applied the “ROS escape” to decompose hydrogen peroxide released by phagocytes into oxygen and water. The surrounding cells were replenished with oxygen, and the patient was in a “happy hypoxia” state. When the phagocytes swallowed the virus, the E protein converted superoxide anions into oxygen and water. In this way, the virus parasitized in the vesicles of the phagocyte. While virus was in the lysosome, the E protein generated ROS to damage nearby hydrolases. In this way, the virus parasitized the lysosome. Excessive hydroxyl free radicals destroyed the membrane structure of the lysosome, causing the hydrolase release from lysosome, autophagy of phagocytic cells and subsequent cell death. As a result, the colonizing phagocytes of the virus was associated with asymptomatic infection or retest-positive. Briefly, the virus inhibited the immune system through “ROS escape”, and damaged the immune system by “ROS attack”. The destruction instigated a strong cytokine storm, leading to organ failure and complications.","Wenzhong, Liu; Hualan, Li",Autoimmunity,https://doi.org/10.1080/08916934.2021.1913581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33899609/,34

Timely initiation of anticoagulation after hospital admission was shown to be beneficial. In this study we aim to examine the association of pre-existing oral anticoagulation (OAC) with outcome among a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the data from the large multi-national Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (LEOSS) from March to August 2020. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible for inclusion. We retrospectively analysed the association of pre-existing OAC with all-cause mortality. Secondary outcome measures included COVID-19-related mortality, recovery and composite endpoints combining death and/or thrombotic event and death and/or bleeding event. We restricted bleeding events to intracerebral bleeding in this analysis to ensure clinical relevance and to limit reporting errors. A total of 1 433 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were analysed, while 334 patients (23.3%) had an existing premedication with OAC and 1 099 patients (79.7%) had no OAC. After risk adjustment for comorbidities, pre-existing OAC showed a protective influence on the endpoint death (OR 0.62, P = 0.013) as well as the secondary endpoints COVID-19-related death (OR 0.64, P = 0.023) and non-recovery (OR 0.66, P = 0.014). The combined endpoint death or thrombotic event tended to be less frequent in patients on OAC (OR 0.71, P = 0.056). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing OAC is protective in COVID-19, irrespective of anticoagulation regime during hospital stay and independent of the stage and course of disease.

The recently published American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America Community-acquired pneumonia guidelines acknowledged that most of what we accept as standard of care is supported only by low quality evidence, highlighting persistent uncertainty and deficiencies in our knowledge. However, progress in diagnostics, translational research, and epidemiology has changed our concept of pneumonia, contributing to a gradual improvement in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes for our patients. The emergence of considerable evidence about adverse long-term health outcomes in pneumonia survivors has also challenged our concept of pneumonia as an acute disease and what treatment end points are important. This review focuses on advances in the research and care of community-acquired pneumonia in the past two decades. We summarize the evidence around our understanding of pathogenesis and diagnosis, discuss key contentious management issues including the role of procalcitonin and the use or non-use of corticosteroids, and explore the relationships between pneumonia and long-term outcomes including cardiovascular and cognitive health.","Jones, Barbara; Waterer, Grant",Ther Adv Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33224494/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2049936120969607,34

Previous studies suggest that obesity is a possible risk factor for adverse outcomes in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the association between obesity and COVID-19 outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 hospitalized patients tested between March 10 and April 13, 2020. SETTING: SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, a COVID-only hospital in New York. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 684 patients were tested for COVID-19 and 504 were analyzed. Patients were categorized into three groups by BMI: normal (BMI 18.50–24.99), overweight (BMI 25.00–29.99), and obese (BMI ≥ 30.00). MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was 30-day in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were intubation, acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute cardiac injury (ACI). RESULTS: There were 139 patients (27%) with normal BMI, 150 patients who were overweight (30%), and 215 patients with obesity (43%). After controlling for age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, and qSOFA score, there was a significantly increased risk of mortality in the overweight (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1–1.9) and obese groups (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0–1.7) compared with those with normal BMI. Similarly, there was a significantly increased relative risk for intubation in the overweight (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2–3.3) and obese groups (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.5–4.0) compared with those with normal BMI. Obesity did not affect rates of AKI, ACI, or ARDS. Furthermore, obesity appears to significantly increase the risk of mortality in males (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-2.0, P = 0.03), but not in females (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.77–1.9, P = 0.40). CONCLUSION: This study reveals that patients with overweight and obesity who have COVID-19 are at increased risk for mortality and intubation compared to those with normal BMI. These findings support the hypothesis that obesity is a risk factor for COVID-19 complications and should be a consideration in management of COVID-19.","Nakeshbandi, Mohamed; Maini, Rohan; Daniel, Pia; Rosengarten, Sabrina; Parmar, Priyanka; Wilson, Clara; Kim, Julie Minjae; Oommen, Alvin; Mecklenburg, Max; Salvani, Jerome; Joseph, Michael A.; Breitman, Igal",Int J Obes (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-020-0648-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32712623/,34

METHODS: An Institutional Review Board exempt, retrospective review of prospectively collected data was performed using the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System’s All Injury Program data from 2005 through 2015 for all UEF sustained in women 15 to 54 years old. Injuries based on reported IPV versus accidental falls or strikes were analyzed accounting for the weighted, stratified nature of the data. RESULTS: IPV-related UEF represented 1.7% of all UEF and 27.2% of all IPV fractures. The finger was the most common fracture site in IPV (34.3%) and accidental striking (53.3%) but accounted for only 10% of fall-related UEF. There was a higher proportion of shoulder fractures in IPV (9.2%) compared to accidental falls (7.4%) or strikes (2.9%). The odds of a finger fracture were 4.32 times greater in IPV than falling and of a shoulder fracture were 3.65 greater in IPV than accidental striking (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: While the finger is the most common site for IPV UEF, it is also the most common location for accidental striking.

To provide real-time, geo-localized risk information, we developed an interactive online dashboard that estimates the risk that at least one individual with SARS-CoV-2 is present in gatherings of different sizes in the United States. The website combines documented case reports at the county level with ascertainment bias information obtained via population-wide serological surveys to estimate real time circulating, per-capita infection rates. These rates are updated daily as a means to visualize the risk associated with gatherings, including county maps and state-level plots.

An online questionnaire was distributed to a convenience sample of students aged 18–34 at a Midwestern university. Of the 938 responses, 675 were complete for analysis. Outcome measures included demographics, food security level, housing, food access barriers, coping strategies, and food assistance program usage. Results found that predictors associated with undergraduate food insecurity included non-White race, receipt of financial aid, lower self-reported health status, living off-campus, employment, and food cost (p < 0.001). Graduate student food insecurity was associated with Asian self-identification, employment, food cost, no time to prepare foods, and lack of foods for dietary needs (p < 0.001). Students with food insecurity were more likely to buy cheap food (p < 0.001). Almost 50% of food-insecure undergraduates asked friends or family to help buy food. Food-insecure students were more likely to want information on meal preparation and budgeting. More graduate students were likely to know of and use food pantries. Overall, food insecurity was higher among undergraduate than graduate students. Universities should consider institutional and policy changes tailored to the separate populations to mitigate the prevalence of campus food insecurity.","Hiller, Molly B.; Winham, Donna M.; Knoblauch, Simon T.; Shelley, Mack C.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18115730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34073623/,34

This study proposed and applied novel time fractional derivative models (FDMs) to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic spreading in the states of Alabama and New York, U.S., two states with quite different population compositions, urbanization, and industry structures. Model applications revealed that the pandemic evolving in the two states exhibited an overall similar time-dependent trend with subtle differences in propagation rates. Alabama may have more inter-county communications in rural areas than urban areas, while the opposite may be true for the New York State. Further analysis using the space FDM showed that the COVID-19 pandemic spread in rural/urban areas of the two states by following the tempered stable density distributions with different indexes, while the number of the state’s pandemic epicenters affected the pattern of the COVID-19 pandemic spreading in space. Finally, applications of a novel time FDM revealed that the evolution of the economy, represented by the weekly unemployment insurance claims in the two states, exhibited different spreading and recovery rates, most likely due to their different exposures and responses to the pandemic. Therefore, COVID-19 spreading dynamics exhibited strong and subtly different spatiotemporal memories in rural and urban areas in the Alabama and New York States, motivating the application of FDMs.","Yu, Xiangnan; Zhang, Yong; Sun, HongGuang",Results Phys,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2021.104360; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221137972100485X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221137972100485X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34642619/,34
678710,Estimating and mitigating the risk of COVID-19 epidemic rebound associated with reopening of international borders in Vietnam: a modelling study,2021-04-12,"Stress-induced changes in viral receptor and susceptibility gene expression were measured in embryonic stem cells (ESC) and differentiated progeny. Rex1 promoter-Red Fluorescence Protein reporter ESC were tested by RNAseq after 72hr exposures to control stress hyperosmotic sorbitol under stemness culture (NS) to quantify stress-forced differentiation (SFD) transcriptomic programs. Control ESC cultured with stemness factor removal produced normal differentiation (ND). Bulk RNAseq transcriptomic analysis showed significant upregulation of two genes involved in Covid-19 cell uptake, Vimentin (VIM) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2). SFD increased the hepatitis A virus receptor (Havcr1) and the transplacental Herpes simplex 1 (HSV1) virus receptor (Pvrl1) compared with ESC undergoing ND. Several other coronavirus receptors, Glutamyl Aminopeptidase (ENPEP) and Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) were upregulated significantly in SFD>ND. Although stressed ESC are more susceptible to infection due to increased expression of viral receptors and decreased resistance, the necessary Covid-19 receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2, was not expressed in our experiments. TMPRSS2, ENPEP, and DPP4 mediate Coronavirus uptake, but are also markers of extra-embryonic endoderm (XEN), which arise from ESC undergoing ND or SFD. Mouse and human ESCs differentiated to XEN increase TMPRSS2 and other Covid-19 uptake-mediating gene expression, but only some lines express ACE2. Covid-19 susceptibility appears to be genotype-specific and not ubiquitous. Of the 30 gene ontology (GO) groups for viral susceptibility, 15 underwent significant stress-forced changes. Of these, 4 GO groups mediated negative viral regulation and most genes in these increase in ND and decrease with SFD, thus suggesting that stress increases ESC viral susceptibility. Taken together, the data suggest that a control hyperosmotic stress can increase Covid-19 susceptibility and decrease viral host resistance in mouse ESC. However, this limited pilot study should be followed with studies in human ESC, tests of environmental, hormonal, and pharmaceutical stressors and direct tests for infection of stressed, cultured ESC and embryos by Covid-19.

(2) Over the course of eight weeks, 9 April to 3 June 2020, 253 individuals with diabetes and 253 matched controls, using Propensity Score Matching (PSM), participated in this cross-sectional study. Participants completed an anonymous survey including demographics, depressive symptoms (PHQ-2), generalized anxiety (GAD-7), COVID-19-related fear, risk perception, and safety behavior. (3) While patients with diabetes expected their risk of infection similar to controls, they reported a higher probability of the occurrence of symptoms, severe course, and dying of COVID-19. Patients with diabetes showed no elevated generalized anxiety or depressive symptoms. However, they reported higher COVID-19-related fear and more adherent and dysfunctional safety behavior compared to controls. (4) From a public health view, it seems encouraging that despite the somatic risk condition, generalized anxiety and depression are not higher in patients with diabetes than in controls. Patients with diabetes report higher COVID-19-related fear, increased risk perception, and behavioral changes. This suggests that individuals with diabetes, as a significant risk group of severe COVID-19, show an adequate perception and functional reaction to the current pandemic.","Musche, Venja; Kohler, Hannah; Bäuerle, Alexander; Schweda, Adam; Weismüller, Benjamin; Fink, Madeleine; Schadendorf, Theresa; Robitzsch, Anita; Dörrie, Nora; Tan, Susanne; Teufel, Martin; Skoda, Eva-Maria",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9040480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33919519/,34

We used a library screening approach to detect binding interactions across one of the largest known panels of membrane-bound and soluble receptors, comprising 5845 targets, expressed recombinantly in human cells. We were able confirm and replicate SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 and other putative coreceptors such as CD209 and CLEC4M. More significantly, we identified interactions with a number of novel SARS-CoV-2 S binding proteins. Three of these novel receptors, NID1, CNTN1 and APOA4 were specific to SARS-CoV-2, and not SARS-COV, with APOA4 binding the S-protein with equal affinity as ACE2. With this knowledge we may further understand the disease pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients and how infection by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to differences in pathology in specific organs or indeed the virulence observed in different ethnicities. Importantly we illustrate a methodology which can be used for rapid, unbiassed identification of cell surface receptors, to support drug screening and drug repurposing approaches for this and future pandemics.","Brockbank, Sarah MV; Soden, Jo; Faba-Rodriguez, Raquel; Ribeiro, Lyn Rosenbrier; Geh, Catherine; Thomas, Helen; Delight, Jenni; Coverley, Lucy; Abbott, W Mark; Freeth, Jim",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.11.434937,34

There has been an expansion in using technology to promote health and wellbeing and technology has the potential to enable people who are socially excluded, including those who are homeless, to be able to access health services. However, little research has been undertaken to explore how technology is used to promote health and wellbeing for those who are homeless. This review aims to address the questions: ‘what mobile health (mHealth) related technology is used by homeless populations’ and ‘what is the health impact of mobile technology for homeless populations’? Methods: An integrative review methodology was employed. A systematic search of electronic databases was carried out between 4 January 2021 and 30 April 2021, searching for papers published between 2015 and 2021, which yielded 2113 hits, relevant papers were selected using specified inclusion and exclusion criteria reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis. The quality assessment of each paper included in the review was undertaken using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results: Seventeen papers were selected for review and thematic analysis identified four themes: technology ownership, barriers to use, connectivity and health benefits. Conclusion: It is evident that technology has the potential to support the health and wellbeing of individuals who are homeless; however, there are challenges regarding connectivity to the internet, as well as issues of trust in who has access to personal data and how they are used. Further research is needed to explore the use of health technology with people who are homeless to address these challenges.","Heaslip, Vanessa; Richer, Stephen; Simkhada, Bibha; Dogan, Huseyin; Green, Sue",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34202242/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136845,34

We aimed to determine the seroprevalence and potential risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs in the Region of Southern Denmark after the first pandemic wave in the spring of 2020. Methods Observational study conducted May-June 2020. SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were measured in plasma. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire consisting of demographic information, risk factors and COVID-19-related symptoms. Results A total of 7,950 participated. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 2.1% (95% CI 1.8-2.4). Seropositive participants were significantly older (mean age 48.9 years vs. 46.7 years in seronegative, P=0.022) and a higher percentage had experienced at least one symptom of COVID-19 (P<0.001). The seroprevalence was significantly higher among HCW working on dedicated COVID-19 wards (3.5%, OR 2.02 (95% CI 1.44-2.84). Seroprevalence was significantly related to 11-50 close physical contacts per day outside work (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.07-2.22). Conclusion The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was low in HCWs. However, the occupational risk for contracting the infection is higher for those working on dedicated COVID-19 wards.

This study aimed to investigate the extent to which these measures affected children's daily routines. More specifically, it aimed to determine how children maintained their learning, physical activity, and screen time routines from the period before the state of emergency was declared. Methods: Response to an online parent-reported questionnaire was conducted (N = 450). The factorial validity of the scales was prepared using confirmatory factor analysis, with acceptable fit indices. Based on that, the authors tested the interrelations between dimensions using structural equation modeling in SPSS, AMOS 24.0. Results: The study results indicate a positive relationship between school achievement and study time (β = 0.25). They also indicate that children who were physically active before the pandemic continued their activities during the emergency state (β = 0.53). Physical activity impact during the COVID-19 emergency measures reduces children's behavior changes (β = 0.55). Finally, they highlight that children who spent more time with multimedia content had greater changes in anxiety, sensitivity, nervousness, and worry due to COVID-19 emergency measures (β = −0.38). Conclusions: Healthy lifestyle habits formed in childhood are suggested to be responsible for the greater “resistance to change” shown by the children from this study.","Vuković, Jovan; Matić, Radenko M.; Milovanović, Ivana M.; Maksimović, Nebojša; Krivokapić, Dragan; Pišot, Saša",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33959575/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.656813,34

The Karnataka plateau located in the Dharwar craton, southern India, is a classic example for the plateau uplift. It is explored using orthogonal deep crustal seismic reflection studies, and a mechanism for the epeirogenic uplift is suggested. A pseudo three-dimensional crustal structure derived from these studies suggests a regionally extensive 10 km thick magmatic underplating in the region. It is further constrained from active-source refraction and passive-source seismological data. We interpret the Marion and Reunion mantle plume activities during 88 Ma and 65 Ma on the western part of Dharwar craton are responsible for the magmatic underplating, which caused epeirogenic uplift. Flexural isostasy related to the onshore denudational unloading and offshore sediment loading is also responsible for the persisting uplift in the region. Plate boundary forces are found to be contributing to the plateau uplift. The present study provides a relationship between the mantle plumes, rifting, development of continental margins, plateau uplift, and denudational isostasy. Combination of exogenic and endogenic processes are responsible for the plateau uplift in the region.","Mandal, Biswajit; Vijaya Rao, V.; Karuppannan, P.; Laxminarayana, K.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33452325/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-80965-7,34

Thus, ACE2 is a potential target for drugs that disrupt the interaction of human cells with SARS‐CoV‐2 to abolish infection. There is also interest on drugs that inhibit or activate ACE2, i.e. for cardiovascular disorders or colitis. Compounds binding at alternative sites could allosterically affect the interaction with Spike protein. We here review biochemical, chemical biology and structural information on ACE2, including the recent cryoEM structures of full length ACE2. We conclude that ACE2 is very dynamic and that allosteric drugs may be developed to target ACE2. At the time of the 2020 pandemic, we suggest that available ACE2 inhibitors or activators in advanced development should be tested for their ability to allosterically displace the interaction between ACE2 and the Spike protein.","Gross, Lissy Z.F.; Sacerdoti, Mariana; Piiper, Albrecht; Zeuzem, Stefan; Leroux, Alejandro E.; Biondi, Ricardo M.",ChemMedChem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32663362/; https://doi.org/10.1002/cmdc.202000368,34

This case series describes lung, chest wall and respiratory-system mechanics in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and ARDS. METHODS: Data was collected from forty patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and ARDS at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. Esophageal balloons were placed to estimate pleural and transpulmonary pressures. Clinical characteristics, respiratory-system, transpulmonary, and chest-wall mechanics were measured over the first week. RESULTS: Patients had moderate-severe ARDS (PaO(2)/FiO(2) 123[98–149]) and were critically ill (APACHE IV 108 [94–128] and SOFA 12 [11–13]).

Respiratory system (30–35 ml/cm H(2)O), lung (40–50 ml/cm H(2)O) and chest wall (120–150 ml/cm H(2)O) compliance remained similar over the first week. Elevated basal pleural pressures correlated with BMI. Patients required prolonged mechanical ventilation (14.5 days [9.5–19.0]), with a mortality of 32.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients displayed normal chest-wall mechanics, with increased basal pleural pressure. Respiratory system and lung mechanics were similar to known existing ARDS cohorts.

AIM: This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess if there were any changes in the number of patients hospitalized for respiratory diseases in Greece during the first CO­VID-19 wave. METHODS: In the present study, we evaluated respiratory disease hospitalization rates across 9 tertiary hospitals in Greece during the study period (March–April 2020) and the corresponding period of the 2 previous years (2018–2019) that served as the control periods. Demographic data and discharge diagnosis were documented for every patient. RESULTS: Of the 1,307 patients who were hospitalized during the study period, 444 (35.5%) were males with a mean (±SD) age of 66.1 ± 16.6 years. There was a 47 and 46% reduction in all-cause respiratory morbidity compared to the corresponding periods of 2018 and 2019, respectively. The mean incidence rate for respiratory diseases during the study period was 21.4 admissions per day, and this rate was significantly lower than the rate during the same period in 2018 (40.8 admissions per day; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.525; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.491–0.562; p < 0.001) or the rate during 2019 (39.9 admissions per day; IRR, 0.537; 95% CI, 0.502–0.574; p < 0.001). The greatest reductions (%) in the number of daily admissions in 2020 were observed for sleep apnoea (87% vs. 2018 and 84% vs. 2019) followed by admissions for asthma (76% vs. 2018 and 79% vs. 2019) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (60% vs. 2018 and 51% vs. 2019), while the lowest reductions were detected in hospitalizations for pulmonary embolism (6% vs. 2018 and 23% vs. 2019) followed by tuberculosis (25% vs. both 2018 and 2019). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The significant reduction in respiratory admissions in 2020 raises the reasonable question of whether some patients may have avoided seeking medical attention during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggests an urgent need for transformation of healthcare systems during the pandemic to offer appropriate management of respiratory diseases other than COVID-19.","Kyriakopoulos, Christos; Gogali, Athena; Exarchos, Konstantinos; Potonos, Dimitrios; Tatsis, Konstantinos; Apollonatou, Vasiliki; Loukides, Stelios; Papiris, Spyros; Sigala, Ioanna; Katsaounou, Paraskevi; Aggelidis, Maximos; Fouka, Evangelika; Porpodis, Konstantinos; Kontakiotis, Theodoros; Sampsonas, Fotis; Karampitsakos, Theodoros; Tzouvelekis, Argyris; Bibaki, Eleni; Karagiannis, Konstantinos; Antoniou, Katerina; Tzanakis, Nikolaos; Dimeas, Ilias; Daniil, Zoe; Gourgoulianis, Konstantinos; Kouratzi, Maria; Steiropoulos, Paschalis; Antonakis, Emmanouil; Papanikolaou, Ilias C.; Ntritsos, Georgios; Kostikas, Konstantinos",Respiration,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827103/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000515323,34
