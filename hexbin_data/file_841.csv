63866,Status and Suggestions on Postmortem Examination during the Outbreak of COVID-19.,2020-04-01,"PURPOSE This umbrella review aims to evaluate the quality, summarize and compare the conclusions of systematic reviews investigating the impact of curative treatment options on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). METHODS The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science were searched independently by two authors from inception until 06 January 2020. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses assessing the impact of any curative treatment option on HRQol in MIBC patients were eligible. Risk of bias was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool. RESULTS Thirty-two reviews were included. Robot-assisted RC with extracorporeal urinary diversion and open RC have similar HRQoL (n = 10). Evidence for pelvic organ-sparing RC was too limited (n = 2). Patients with a neobladder showed better overall and physical HRQoL outcomes, but worse urinary function in comparison with ileal conduit (n = 17). Bladder-preserving radiochemotherapy showed slightly better urinary and sexual but worse gastro-intestinal HRQoL outcomes in comparison with RC patients (n = 6). Quality of the reviews was low in more than 50% of the available reviews and most of the studies included in the reviews were nonrandomized studies.

These virus-induced changes result in the induction of vesicular structures that envelop the virus replication complex (RC). In this study, we have extended our previous observations on the intracellular location of West Nile virus strain Kunjin virus (WNV(KUN)) to show that the virus-induced recruitment of host proteins and membrane appears to occur at a pre-Golgi step. To visualize the WNV(KUN) replication complex, we performed three-dimensional (3D) modeling on tomograms from WNV(KUN) replicon-transfected cells. These analyses have provided a 3D representation of the replication complex, revealing the open access of the replication complex with the cytoplasm and the fluidity of the complex to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, we provide data that indicate that a majority of the viral RNA species housed within the RC is in a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) form.","Gillespie, Leah K; Hoenen, Antje; Morgan, Gary; Mackenzie, Jason M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00986-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20686019/,841
67977,[Interim Guidelines for Prevention and Control of COVID-19 for Students Back to School].,2020-05-09,"INTRODUCTION As legislation addressing medical treatments continues to evolve, there are several circumstances (eg, abortion, assisted dying) in which health practitioners may choose to not provide legally available care options. It is not always clear what underlies practitioner choice, as some research has suggested non-participation in care provision is not always due to an ethical abstention but may represent other factors. This results in tension between a practitioner's right to refrain from practices deemed morally objectionable by the practitioner, and the care recipient's right to access legally available treatments. The aim of this systematic scoping review is to identify the current knowledge regarding all the factors influencing practitioner's choices when declining involvement in legally available healthcare options. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Arksey and O'Malley's scoping framework in concert with Levac et al's enhancements will guide the systematic scoping review methodological processes. English language documents from 1 January 1998 to current will be sought using Medline, CINAHL, JSTOR, EMBASE, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, PsychINFO and Sociological Abstracts. MeSH headings, keywords and synonyms will be adjusted using an iterative search process. Theses and dissertations will be included in the search protocol; however, other grey literature will be accessed only as required. Two research team members will screen the abstracts and full articles against inclusion criteria. Article information will be extracted via a data collection tool and undergo thematic analysis. Descriptive summary (visual summary and study contextual information) and a presentation of analytical themes will align findings back to the research question. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not required. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist will be used to support transparency and guide translation of findings. Findings will be disseminated through professional networks, in peer-reviewed journals and conferences via abstract and presentation.","Brown, Janine; Goodridge, Donna; Thorpe, Lilian; Chipanshi, Mary",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-023901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30121617/,841
77426,[Current status of COVID-19 pandemic and progress in response strategy].,2020-11-16,"OBJECTIVE Symptomatic long-term hypoparathyroidism following thyroid surgery requires an alternative and permanent therapy that would effectively restore parathyroid function and eliminate the need for substitution drug therapy. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on the efficacy and safety of parathyroid allotransplantation to treat post-operative hypoparathyroidism. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS and the Cochrane Library were searched for published articles (from inception of each database to September 30, 2018). A total of 9 studies comprising 146 patients (177 allotransplantations) with post thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism were identified. RESULTS Parathyroid tissues used for allotransplant were cultured parathyroid cells, cryopreserved parathyroid cells and encapsulated microspheres. Post-transplant immunosuppression was only reported in three studies, mainly with oral prednisolone for 2 weeks to 6 months. Mean graft survival following allotransplantation was 47% (95% CI 24%-71%) when patients were followed-up to 6 months and 41% (95% CI 2.3%-80%) at 12 months. There was significant unexplained heterogeneity observed between studies in both these groups (I2 > 50%). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and serum calcium levels post intervention was not reported in all studies, but available evidence suggests the levels remains higher (PTH level around 12 pg/ml; Ca level around 8 mg/dl) post-allotransplantation for up to 24 months. CONCLUSIONS Long-term benefit and harms of allotransplantation is still unclear due to the clinical and statistical heterogeneity observed among the studies. Therefore, conduct of a well-designed controlled clinical trial in the immediate future on allotransplantation is of paramount importance.","Parameswaran, R; Samuel, M; Satish, R L; Kripesh, A; Moorthy, V; Vajjhala, R; Ng, X L; Yip, G W; Voon, F C T; Chandran, Manju",The surgeon : journal of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surge.2020.06.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680813/,841

86274,[Preliminary analysis on COVID-19 case spectrum and spread intensity in different provinces in China except Hubei province].,2020-10-10,"Objective To investigate and analyze the effectiveness of internal fixation with the two different cannulated screw implanting methods of rhomboid and inverted triangle in the treatment of femoral neck fracture in young adults. Methods The clinical data of 38 young adults with femoral neck fracture who met the selection criteria between January 2018 and August 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the different methods of cannulated screw implanting, the patients were divided into two groups, 19 cases in each group. The trial group was treated with closed reduction and cannulated screw rhombic distribution internal fixation, while the control group was treated with closed reduction and cannulated screw inverted triangular distribution internal fixation. There was no significant differences in patients' gender, age, cause of injury, Garden classification of fracture, and time from injury to operation between the two groups ( P>0.05). The fracture healing time, the incidence of nonunion, femoral neck shortening, and femoral head necrosis were recorded and compared between the two groups; the effectiveness was evaluated by Harris score and visual analogue scale (VAS) score at last follow-up. Results The incisions of the two groups healed by first intention. All patients were followed up 12-24 months with an average of 15.5 months. There were 1 case of fracture nonunion and 2 cases of shortening of femoral neck in the trial group; while there were 2 cases of fracture nonunion, 1 case of necrosis of femoral head, and 6 cases of femoral neck shortening in the control group; the difference in the incidence of complications (15.8% vs. 47.4%) between the two groups was significant ( χ 2=4.385, P=0.036). The remaining 18 cases in the trial group and 17 cases in the control group all achieved osteonal union, and the healing time was (14.8±1.6) weeks and (15.9±1.3) weeks, respectively, showing no significant difference between the two groups ( t=1.265, P=0.214). At last follow-up, Harris score and VAS score of the trial group were 88.9±4.3 and 1.1±0.7, respectively, while those of the control group were 86.9±5.9 and 1.3±0.9, respectively, showing no significant difference ( t=0.603, P=0.550; t=1.152, P=0.257). Hip function was evaluated in accordance with Harris score, the results were excellent in 12 cases, good in 6 cases, and fair in 1 case in the trial group, the excellent and good rate was 94.74%; the results were excellent in 10 cases, good in 7 cases, and fair in 2 cases in the control group, the excellent and good rate was 89.47%; there was no significant difference in the excellent and good rate between the two groups ( χ 2=0.368, P=0.544). Conclusion The short-term effectiveness of the two kinds of cannulated screw implanting methods is clear, rhomboid fixation of 4 screws has strong stability with stress distribution, which can effectively reduce the incidence of femoral neck shortening, fracture nonunion, femoral head necrosis, and other complications.","Wang, Zhaodong; Guan, Jianzhong; Wu, Min; Zhu, Zhonglian; Zhou, Pinghui; Liu, Yajun; Xu, Chen; Zhao, Yupeng",Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi = Chinese journal of reparative and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.7507/1002-1892.202009103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719240/,841

To investigate the rate of manuscript submission to a major peer-reviewed journal (American Journal of Public Health) by gender, comparing periods before and during the pandemic.Methods. We used data from January 1 to May 12, 2020, and defined the start of the pandemic period by country as the first date of 50 or more confirmed cases. We used an algorithm to classify gender based on first name and nation of origin. We included authors whose gender could be estimated with a certainty of at least 95%.Results. Submission rates were higher overall during the pandemic compared with before. Increases were higher for submissions from men compared with women (41.9% vs 10.9% for corresponding author). For the United States, submissions increased 23.8% for men but only 7.9% for women. Women authored 29.4% of COVID-19-related articles.Conclusions.

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential to limit the spread of infectious diseases. However, laboratory detection of infectious agents, especially the simultaneous detection of multiple agents, can be challenging to the clinician and diagnostic laboratory. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), which allows millions of DNA templates to be sequenced simultaneously in a single reaction, is an ideal technology for comprehensive testing. We conducted a proof-of-concept study of targeted NGS to detect 62 common equine bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens in clinical samples. We designed 264 primers and constructed a bioinformatics tool for the detection of targeted pathogens. The designed primers were able to specifically detect the intended pathogens. Results of testing 27 clinical samples with our targeted NGS assay compared with results of routine tests (assessed as a group) yielded positive percent agreement of 81% and negative percent agreement of 83%, overall agreement of 81%, and kappa of 0.56 (moderate agreement). This moderate agreement was likely the result of low sensitivity of some primers. However, our NGS assay successfully detected multiple pathogens in the clinical samples, including some pathogens missed by routine techniques.","Anis, Eman; Ilha, Marcia R S; Engiles, Julie B; Wilkes, Rebecca P","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638720978381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305693/,841

A 58-year-old man presented with progressive diplopia. Angiography and contrast-enhanced CT showed an ethmoidal dural AVF supplied via the bilateral anterior ethmoidal arteries and venous drainage through the left SOV and IOV. A transarterial approach through the bilateral anterior ethmoidal arteries was used to place the microcatheter close to the fistula site. After intra-arterial embolization with 20% N-butyl cyanoacrylate, the dural AVF was completely occluded. In patients with good vascular access, endovascular transarterial embolization may be an effective and less invasive treatment strategy for ethmoidal dural AVF.","Inoue, Akihiro; Tagawa, Masahiko; Kumon, Yoshiaki; Watanabe, Hideaki; Shoda, Daisuke; Sugiu, Kenji; Ohnishi, Takanori",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2013-011098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667945/,841

We sought to determine the effects of exercise training on functional capacity, health-related quality of life (HQoL), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in patients with ChC. METHODS AND RESULTS This randomized, controlled, single-blind trial included 40 patients with ChC (age 49.5 +/- 7.8 years, 57.5% male) who did not practice regular exercise. All patients were assessed, at baseline and at the end of the study, by exercise test (VO(2) and exercise time), six-minute walk test (6MWT), Goldman Specific Activity Scale (SAS), HQoL, and BNP levels. Patients were randomized to inactive control group (ICG = 19) or exercise training group (ETG = 21). Exercise training group patients underwent 12 weeks of exercise training: walking for up to 30 min (intensity 50-70% HR reserve + HR at rest) and warm-up and cooling-down exercising, three times a week. The data were analysed for delta values (Delta= end - baseline). After intervention, compared with the ICG, the ETG had significant increases in functional parameters including, DeltaVO(2) (6.5 vs. 2.8 mL/kg/min, P = 0.001), Delta exercise time (2.9 vs.1.1 min, P < 0.001), Delta6MWT distance (83.5 vs. 2.0 m, P = 0.001) improved DeltaSAS (8 vs. 1 patient, P = 0.008), and HQoL: Delta domains vitality (7.5 vs. 0 points, P = 0.013), Delta emotional aspects (16.7 vs. 0 points, P = 0.012), and Delta mental health (16.1 vs. 0 points, P = 0.031).

The healing of rats' fracture was observed by X-ray films, the morphological changes of bone fractures by HE staining, the callus formation by micro-CT and biomechanical test, and the expression of osteogenesis-related genes, HMGB1 and ERK-related proteins by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Rats in the HMGB1 group was increased in X-ray scores, peak torque, torsional stiffness, and the bone volume fraction (bone volume/total volume, BV/TV); meanwhile, those rats presented elevations in osteogenesis-related genes and HMGB1 expressions, as well as p-ERK/ERK ratio. However, rats in the HMGB1+ PD98059 group was significantly reduced in X-ray score, peak torque, torsional stiffness, and BV/TV, as well as the expression of osteogenesis-related genes and the ratio of p-ERK/ERK, as compared to those from HMGB1 group.

African Americans are twice as likely to be diagnosed with diabetes and have two to four times the rates of T2DM-associated complications. Depression has long been associated with poor outcomes of diabetic self-management and glycemic control. Comorbidity of T2DM and depression worsen effective self-management of these conditions in the African American population. The purpose of the study was to synthesize the literature with practice recommendations of care related to T2DM and depression in the African American population. METHODS A literature search was conducted using PRISMA in June 2018 with PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane, Scopus, Embase, and PsycINFO databases using the years from 2008 through 2018. The following terms and combination of terms were used to identify articles for the review: (a) diabetes mellitus, type 2, (b) diabetes type 2 and depression, and (c) diabetes mellitus type 2, depression, African America. CONCLUSIONS The overall prevalence of depression with T2DM in African Americans is about 25%. The quality of care received by African Americans is lower when compared with non-Hispanic Whites, resulting in more emergency department visits and fewer physician visits per year. African Americans require supportive and trusting collaboration with providers for the ongoing optimal management of these complex conditions. IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE Culturally relevant education on lifestyle modification may help mitigate barriers to management of T2DM and depression in the African American population. Using the diabetes self-management education/support to help empower African Americans may be essential for effective self-management strategies of T2DM and depression.","Ajuwon, Abidemi Mary; Love, Rene",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.1097/jxx.0000000000000240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31348139/,841

The potential provides an equally good fit of the laser induced fluorescence Fourier transform spectroscopic data of Pashov et al. [Phys. Rev. A 76, 022511 (2007)] as their multi-parameter potential. The new potential is supported by the good agreement of the well parameters De, Re and the harmonic vibrational constant ωe with combining-rule estimates. The scattering lengths for all six isotopologues are also in excellent agreement with experiment with a 0.2% adjustment within theoretical uncertainty of the leading dispersion coefficient C6. An analysis of the harmonic vibrational constant ωe and the constant ωexe of the potential of Pashov et al. reveals a significant difference to the present potential which turned out to be due to an oscillatory deviation in their potential in the vicinity of the potential minimum.

Although MERS-CoV has had a consistently high mortality rate in humans, no vaccines have been approved to prevent MERS-CoV infection in humans. MERS-CoV spike (S) protein is a key target for development of MERS vaccines. AREAS COVERED In this review, we illustrate the structure and function of S protein as a vaccine target, describe available animal models for evaluating MERS vaccines, and summarize recent progress on MERS-CoV S-based vaccines, focusing on their ability to elicit antibody and/or cellular immune responses, neutralizing antibodies, and protection against MERS-CoV infection in different models. Prospects for future MERS-CoV S-based vaccines are discussed. EXPERT COMMENTARY The majority of MERS vaccines under development are based on MERS-CoV S protein, including full-length S, S1, and receptor-binding domain (RBD).

LA is one of the laboratory criteria identified in patients with antiphospholipid (antibody) syndrome (APS). The presence of LA in patients with APS represents a significant risk factor for both thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity. There have been several reports of similarities between some of the pathophysiological features of COVID-19 and APS, in particular the most severe form, catastrophic APS. There have also been many reports identifying various aPLs, including LA, in COVID-19 patients. Accordingly, a very pertinent question arises: ""Is LA a feature of COVID-19 pathology?"" In this review, we critically appraise the literature to help answer this question. We conclude that LA positivity is a feature of COVID-19, at least in some patients, and potentially those who are the sickest or have the most severe infection. However, many publications have failed to appropriately consider the many confounders to LA identification, being assessed using clot-based assays such as the dilute Russell viper venom time, the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and the silica clotting time. First, most patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are placed on anticoagulant therapy, and those with prior histories of thrombosis would possibly present to hospital already on anticoagulant therapy. All anticoagulants, including vitamin K antagonists, heparin (both unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin), and direct oral anticoagulants affect these clot-based assays. Second, C-reactive protein (CRP) is highly elevated in COVID-19 patients, and also associated with severity. CRP can also lead to false-positive LA, particularly with the aPTT assay. Third, persistence of aPL positivity (including LA) is required to identify APS. Fourth, those at greatest risk of thrombosis due to aPL are those with highest titers or multiple positivity. Most publications either did not identify anticoagulation and/or CRP in their COVID-19 cohorts or did not seem to account for these as possible confounders for LA detection. Most publications did not assess for aPL persistence, and where persistence was checked, LA appeared to represent transient aPL. Finally, high titer aPL or multiple aPL positivity were in the minority of COVID-19 presentations. Thus, at least some of the reported LAs associated with COVID-19 are likely to be false positives, and the relationship between the detected aPL/LA and COVID-19-associated coagulopathy remains to be resolved using larger and better studies.","Favaloro, Emmanuel J; Henry, Brandon Michael; Lippi, Giuseppe",Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1729856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34130341/,841

DESIGN a retrospective observational study based was used. Data deriving from the COVID-19 epidemic surveillance and from the collection of information on drugs consume by Sicilian residents. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS due to the data availability, the study was calibrated on the Region and included all population distinguishing by gender and age groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES the risks of cumulative incidence for COVID-19 were investigated in people who had diabetes comorbidities to incur a hospitalization for COVID-19, to be treated within an intensive care unit, and lethality. The role of previous antidiabetic drug treatments with respect to each study outcome was also investigated. RESULTS in Sicily, from 01.03.2020 to 26.06.2020, a number of 172 cases of COVID-19 disease with diabetes comorbidity were diagnosed. The data did not show any difference in the cumulative incidence for COVID-19 between diabetics (64.2/100,000 inhabitants) and non-diabetics (56.9/100,000 inhabitants) patients. Diabetes increases the risk of hospitalization in the under 80 in both men and women (men: OR 2.62; women OR 4.31), for treatment in intensive care (men: OR 4,41; women: OR 7.74), and for death (men: OR 5.21; women OR 5.92). The analysis of drug using showed risks effect of insulin (OR 2.13) on hospitalization, sulfonylureas/glinides (OR 2.58) on intensive care and protective of metformin on death both in single component (OR 0.44) and in multicomponent (OR 0.43). CONCLUSIONS data availability made it possible to monitor the occurrence and explore some of the characteristics of the cases with COVID-19 in Sicily. Diabetes does not seem to represent a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Sicily, while previous diabetes condition seems to determine greater risk of hospitalization, treatment in intensive care, and lethality among over 80. There are also gender differences with almost double risks in women for hospitalization and intensive care only. Among the antidiabetic drugs investigated, there was a risk for hospitalization and intensive care while protective for deaths. This study represents an important tool for the activation of intervention programmes in the area aimed at populations with greater health risk deriving from the effects of this new pandemic.","Cernigliaro, Achille; Allotta, Alessandra Vincenza; Scondotto, Salvatore",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,https://doi.org/10.19191/ep20.5-6.s2.132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412824/,841

Light activation of thiol enzymes by the thioredoxin (Trx) systems and cyclic electron transport by the PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION 5 (PGR5)-dependent pathway contribute substantially to regulation of photosynthesis. Arabidopsis thaliana mutants lacking f-type Trxs (trx f1f2) show delayed activation of carbon assimilation due to impaired photoreduction of Calvin-Benson cycle enzymes. To further study regulatory mechanisms that contribute to efficiency during the induction of photosynthesis, we analyzed the contributions of PSI donor- and acceptor-side regulation in the trx f1f2 mutant background. The cytochrome b6f complex is involved in PSI donor-side regulation, whereas PGR5-dependent PSI cyclic electron transport is required for both donor and acceptor functions. Introduction of the pgr1 mutation, which is conditionally defective in cytochrome b6f complex activity, into the trx f1f2 mutant background did not further affect the induction of photosynthesis, but the combined deficiency of Trx f and PGR5 severely impaired photosynthesis and suppressed plant growth under long-day conditions. In the pgr5 trx f1f2 mutant, the acceptor-side of PSI was almost completely reduced, and quantum yields of PSII and PSI hardly increased during the induction of photosynthesis. We also compared the photoreduction of thiol enzymes between the trx f1f2 and pgr5 trxf1f2 mutants. The pgr5 mutation did not result in further impaired photoreduction of Calvin-Benson cycle enzymes or ATP synthase in the trx f1f2 mutant background. These results indicated that acceptor-side limitations in the pgr5 trx f1f2 mutant suppress photosynthesis initiation, suggesting that PGR5 is required for efficient photosynthesis induction.","Okegawa, Yuki; Basso, Leonardo; Shikanai, Toshiharu; Motohashi, Ken",Plant physiology,https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.20.00741; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917772/,841

Traditionally, one cell type is used for TPP studies, with the risk of missing important differentially expressed target proteins. The use of whole organisms would circumvent this problem. Zebrafish embryos are amenable to such an approach. Here, we used TPP on whole zebrafish embryo lysate to identify protein targets of napabucasin, a compound that may affect Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling through an ill-understood mechanism. In zebrafish embryos, napabucasin induced developmental defects consistent with inhibition of Stat3 signaling. TPP profiling showed no distinct shift in Stat3 upon napabucasin treatment, but effects were detected on the oxidoreductase, Pora, which might explain effects on Stat3 signaling. Interestingly, thermal stability of several aldehyde dehydrogenases (Aldhs) was affected. Moreover, napabucasin activated ALDH enzymatic activity in vitro. Aldhs have crucial roles in retinoic acid metabolism and functionally we validated napabucasin-mediated activation of the retinoic acid pathway in zebrafish in vivo. We conclude that TPP profiling in whole zebrafish embryo lysate is feasible and facilitates direct correlation of in vivo effects of small molecule drugs with their protein targets.","Leijten, Niels M; Bakker, Petra; Spaink, Herman P; den Hertog, Jeroen; Lemeer, Simone",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.ra120.002273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33115751/,841

Dutch national guidelines have recommended the use of FDG-PET/CT and SL for patients with locally advanced tumors since July 2016. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of FDG-PET/CT and SL in The Netherlands. METHODS Between 2011 and 2018, all patients who underwent surgery for gastric cancer were included from the Dutch Upper GI Cancer Audit. The use of FDG-PET/CT and SL was evaluated before and after revision of the Dutch guidelines. Outcomes included the number of non-curative procedures (e.g. palliative and futile procedures) and the association of FDG-PET/CT and SL, with waiting times from diagnosis to the start of treatment. RESULTS A total of 3310 patients were analyzed. After July 2016, the use of FDG-PET/CT (23% vs. 61%; p < 0.001) and SL (21% vs. 58%; p < 0.001) increased. FDG-PET/CT was associated with additional waiting time to neoadjuvant therapy (4 days), as well as primary surgical treatment (20 days), and SL was associated with 8 additional days of waiting time to neoadjuvant therapy. Performing SL or both modalities consecutively in patients in whom it was indicated was not associated with the number of non-curative procedures. CONCLUSION During implementation of FDG-PET/CT and SL after revision of the guidelines, both have increasingly been used in The Netherlands. The addition of these staging methods was associated with increased waiting time to treatment. The number of non-curative procedures did not differ after performing none, solely one, or both staging modalities.","Gertsen, Emma C; Borggreve, Alicia S; Brenkman, Hylke J F; Verhoeven, Rob H A; Vegt, Erik; van Hillegersberg, Richard; Siersema, Peter D; Ruurda, Jelle P",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-09096-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901312/,841

There is concern severe OSAS increases risk of comorbid cardiopulmonary abnormalities, such as ventricular hypertrophy or pulmonary hypertension, which preoperative testing could detect. Our objective is to determine if there is a severity of pediatric OSAS where previously undetected cardiopulmonary comorbidities are likely. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective chart review. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of 358 patients ≤21 years with severe OSAS who underwent adenotonsillectomy at a tertiary hospital June 1, 2016 to June 1, 2018. We extracted demographics, comorbidities, polysomnography, and preoperative tests. Wilcoxon rank-sum and logistic regression estimated associations of OSAS severity (based on obstructive apnea-hypopnea index [OAHI], hypoxia, hypercarbia) with preoperative echocardiograms and chest X-rays (CXRs). RESULTS Mean age was 5.9 (±3.6) years and 52% were male. Mean OAHI and oxygen saturation nadir were 30.3 (±23.8) and 80.7% (±9.2), respectively. OAHI ≥60 was associated with having a preoperative echocardiogram (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.7-8.5) or CXR (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.4-6.8) compared to OAHI 10-59. There were no significant associations between OSAS severity and test abnormalities. The presence of previously diagnosed cardiopulmonary comorbidities was associated with abnormalities on echocardiogram (OR, 36; 95% CI, 4.1-320.1) and CXR (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.2-14.4). CONCLUSIONS Although pediatric patients with very severe OSAS (OAHI ≥60) underwent more pre-adenotonsillectomy cardiopulmonary tests, OSAS severity did not predict abnormal findings. Known cardiopulmonary comorbidities may be a better indication for cardiopulmonary testing than polysomnographic parameters, which could streamline pre-adenotonsillectomy evaluation and reduce cost.

OBJECTIVE To review the contemporary literature on optimal medical therapy after PCI. EVIDENCE REVIEW We performed a comprehensive search of the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases for manuscripts on medical therapy after PCI, published between 2000 and February 2013. Bibliographies of the retrieved studies were searched by hand for other relevant studies. Priority was given to data from large randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Of the 6852 publications retrieved, 91 were included. FINDINGS Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (eg, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) reduces the risk of stent thrombosis and subsequent cardiovascular events post-PCI (number needed to treat, 33-53) and is the current standard of care. Aspirin should be continued indefinitely and low dose (75-100 mg daily) is preferred over higher doses. A P2Y12 inhibitor should be administered for 12 months after PCI, unless the patient is at high risk for bleeding; however, ongoing studies are assessing the value of shorter or longer duration of P2Y12 inhibitor administration. In patients with acute coronary syndromes, prasugrel and ticagrelor further reduce cardiovascular ischemic events compared with clopidogrel but are associated with higher bleeding risk. If possible, noncardiac surgery should be delayed until 12 months after coronary stenting. Patients receiving coronary stents who require warfarin are at high risk for bleeding if they also receive dual antiplatelet therapy. Omission of aspirin may be advantageous in such patients. Routine platelet function or genetic testing is currently not recommended to tailor antiplatelet therapy after PCI. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Dual antiplatelet therapy remains the cornerstone of medical therapy after PCI.

A novel minimized invasive strategy combining inline radiofrequency pre-coagulation and transumbilical SIL is presented herein. METHODS A cohort of 21 selected patients underwent transumbilical SIL hepatectomies (segmentectomies II-VI) utilizing inline radiofrequency pre-coagulation for hepatic transection (Habib 4X). Bleeding control, postoperative complications and positive resection margins in malignant diseases served as primary and secondary outcome parameters, respectively. RESULTS Single-incision laparoscopy was successfully completed in all patients. A total of 33 segments were retrieved: mean resection time was 66 ± 35 min, including 11 anatomical (52.38%) and 10 non-anatomical (47.62%) resections. Sixteen patients (76.19%) underwent concomitant abdominal surgery. No substantial blood loss occurred. Neither additional staplers nor clips were necessary to control any bleeding or bile leakage. One pleural effusion counted for the only postoperative complication. Free margins could be achieved in all but one resection (12/13 patients with malignancies; 92.31%). Ninety-day mortality was zero. CONCLUSIONS The combination of SIL and inline radiofrequency pre-coagulation proved to be a simple, efficacious and safe technique in minor hepatectomy.","Weiss, Michael; Mittermair, Christof; Brunner, Eberhard; Schirnhofer, Jan; Obrist, Christian; Pimpl, Katharina; Hell, Tobias; Weiss, Helmut",Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic sciences,https://doi.org/10.1002/jhbp.295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26510122/,841

There exists a need for a formal, comprehensive training curriculum accessible to all providers that is time- and cost-effective. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is are additional barriers of social distancing, remote virtual healthcare delivery, and geographic dispersion of healthcare personnel. To address these concerns, we developed a curriculum to target these competencies and deliver them virtually. The curriculum was developed and executed based on Kern's six-step approach to curriculum development, and the objective was to train military behavioral health providers on temporary duty limitations, administrative separations, and medical board referrals based on current US Army policies and procedures. The training was implemented virtually and conducted over the course of 3-hour training sessions to two separate groups. Evaluation of training objectives was conducted via a survey of paired before and after questions, analyzing the change in perceived confidence among learners. Among the 58 respondents, training resulted in statistically significant improvement in confidence in recognizing when a US Army soldier needs a temporary profile, writing a temporary e-profile, deciding when it is critical to contact a US Army soldier's commander, executing administrative separation, deciding when a US Army soldier is at medical retention determination point (MRDP), and in referring a US Army soldier to medical board. Results show the feasibility of virtual training to enhance medical readiness-related competencies of healthcare providers at the enterprise-level to help improve medical readiness. Limitations included immediate and subjective aspects of our results.

Among the least known viral proteins in this family is the nonstructural protein NS4B, which has been suggested to be a part of the replication complex. Hydrophobicity plots indicate a common profile among the NS4B proteins from different members of the Flaviviridae family, suggesting a common function. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of HCV NS4B, we have determined localization and topology of this protein by using recombinant HCV NS4B constructs. The protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but also induced a pattern of cytoplasmic foci positive for markers of the ER. Computer predictions of the membrane topology of NS4B suggested that it has four transmembrane segments. The N and C termini were anticipated to be localized in the cytoplasm, because they are processed by the cytoplasmic NS3 protein. By introducing glycosylation sites at various positions in HCV NS4B, we show that the C terminus is cytoplasmic and the loop around residue 161 is lumenal as predicted. Surprisingly, the N-terminal tail was translocated into the lumen in a considerable fraction of the NS4B molecules, most likely by a posttranslational process. Interestingly, NS4B proteins of the yellow fever and dengue viruses also have their N termini located in the ER lumen due to an N-terminal signal peptide not found in NS4B of HCV.

215736,[A case report of aplastic anemia accompanied with COVID-19],2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is sweeping the globe. Despite multiple case-series, actionable knowledge to tailor decision-making proactively is missing. RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a statistical model accurately predict infection with COVID-19? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a prospective registry of all patients tested for COVID-19 in Cleveland Clinic to create individualized risk prediction models. We focus here on the likelihood of a positive nasal or oropharyngeal COVID-19 test. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression algorithm was constructed that removed variables that were not contributing to the model's cross-validated concordance index. After external validation in a temporally and geographically distinct cohort, the statistical prediction model was illustrated as a nomogram and deployed in an online risk calculator. RESULTS: In the development cohort, 11,672 patients fulfilled study criteria, including 818 patients (7.0%) who tested positive for COVID-19; in the validation cohort, 2295 patients fulfilled criteria, including 290 patients who tested positive for COVID-19. Male, African American, older patients, and those with known COVID-19 exposure were at higher risk of being positive for COVID-19. Risk was reduced in those who had pneumococcal polysaccharide or influenza vaccine or who were on melatonin, paroxetine, or carvedilol. Our model had favorable discrimination (c-statistic = 0.863 in the development cohort and 0.840 in the validation cohort) and calibration. We present sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value at different prediction cutoff points. The calculator is freely available at https://riskcalc.org/COVID19. INTERPRETATION: Prediction of a COVID-19 positive test is possible and could help direct health-care resources. We demonstrate relevance of age, race, sex, and socioeconomic characteristics in COVID-19 susceptibility and suggest a potential modifying role of certain common vaccinations and drugs that have been identified in drug-repurposing studies.","Jehi, Lara; Ji, Xinge; Milinovich, Alex; Erzurum, Serpil; Rubin, Brian P; Gordon, Steve; Young, James B; Kattan, Michael W",Chest,,841

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 33 patients who underwent closed reduction and PFNA fixation for high plane intertrochanteric femur fracture between January 2016 and June 2019. There were 12 males and 21 females with an average age of 75.1 years (mean, 47-89 years). The fractures were caused by falling from height in 21 cases, by traffic accident in 7 cases, and by other injuries in 5 cases. Fractures were classified as type A in 14 cases and type B in 19 cases according to self-defined fracture classification criteria; and as type 31-A1.2 in 14 cases and as type 31-A2.2 in 19 cases according to AO/Orthopedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) classification criteria. The time from injury to operation was 2-5 days (mean, 2.7 days). The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay, fracture reduction quality, fracture healing time, internal fixation failure, and Parker-Palmer score were recorded. Results: The operation time was 40-75 minutes (mean, 55 minutes). The intraoperative blood loss was 50-150 mL (mean, 64 mL). The hospital stay was 5-15 days (mean, 8.7 days). All incisions healed by first intention. Twenty-eight patients were followed up 12-18 months with an average of 13.6 months. The fracture reduction quality was rated as excellent in 9 cases (32.1%), good in 17 cases (60.7%), and poor in 2 cases (7.1%) by Chang's criteria. Parker-Palmer score was 6-9 (mean, 7.9) at last follow-up. Conclusion: High plane intertrochanteric femur fracture is a special type of intertrochanteric fracture, which can be diagnosed by imaging examination. PFNA fixation can achieve satisfactory results and prevent the occurrence of internal fixation failure effectively.","Hu, Sunjun; Du, Shouchao; Xiong, Wenfeng; Chen, Shiyi; Song, Hui; Chang, Shimin",Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi,,841
227611,[Interim Guidelines for Prevention and Control of COVID-19 for Students Back to School],2020,"BACKGROUND: With the lack of effective therapy, chemoprevention, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, focusing on the immediate repurposing of existing drugs gives hope of curbing the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent unbiased genomics-guided tracing of the SARS-CoV-2 targets in human cells identified vitamin D among the three top-scoring molecules manifesting potential infection mitigation patterns. Growing pre-clinical and epidemiological observational data support this assumption. We hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation may improve the prognosis of COVID-19. The aim of this trial is to compare the effect of a single oral high dose of cholecalciferol versus a single oral standard dose on all-cause 14-day mortality rate in COVID-19 older adults at higher risk of worsening. METHODS: The COVIT-TRIAL study is an open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled superiority trial. Patients aged &#8805; 65 years with COVID-19 (diagnosed within the preceding 3 days with RT-PCR and/or chest CT scan) and at least one worsening risk factor at the time of inclusion (i.e., age &#8805; 75 years, or SpO2 &#8804; 94% in room air, or PaO2/FiO2 &#8804; 300 mmHg), having no contraindications to vitamin D supplementation, and having received no vitamin D supplementation > 800 IU/day during the preceding month are recruited. Participants are randomized either to high-dose cholecalciferol (two 200,000 IU drinking vials at once on the day of inclusion) or to standard-dose cholecalciferol (one 50,000 IU drinking vial on the day of inclusion). Two hundred sixty participants are recruited and followed up for 28 days. The primary outcome measure is all-cause mortality within 14 days of inclusion. Secondary outcomes are the score changes on the World Health Organization Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI) scale for COVID-19, and the between-group comparison of safety. These outcomes are assessed at baseline, day 14, and day 28, together with the serum concentrations of 25(OH)D, creatinine, calcium, and albumin at baseline and day 7. DISCUSSION: COVIT-TRIAL is to our knowledge the first randomized controlled trial testing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the prognosis of COVID-19 in high-risk older patients. High-dose vitamin D supplementation may be an effective, well-tolerated, and easily and immediately accessible treatment for COVID-19, the incidence of which increases dramatically and for which there are currently no scientifically validated treatments.

The perceived risk increased by 4.9% for every one-year increase of age. People who used WeChat contacts (OR = 0.196) as the main media information source, reported a lower perceived risk. CONCLUSION: Residents reported a high level of risk perception towards COVID-19 in Chongqing and it was impacted by the population demographic characteristics. Media information sources, including community information platforms and community workers may cause the increase of public risk perceptions.","He, Shan; Chen, Siyu; Kong, Lingna; Liu, Weiwei",J. community health,,841

In a recent article published by Batlle et al. (Clin. Sci. (Lond.)

Another way, discussed here, to capture SARS-CoV-2, as an adjunct or alternative, would be to use ACE2+-small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). A competitive inhibition therapy could therefore be developed, using sEVs from engineered mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs), overexpressing ACE2.","Inal, Jameel M",Clin Sci (Lond),,841

We took that opportunity to provide a response focused on urban Indigenous communities in the United States and Canada. Here, we expand on that response and Indigenous and human rights lens to review policies and practices impacting the experience of COVID-19 for urban Indigenous communities. Our analysis integrates a discussion of historical and ongoing settler colonialism, and the strengths of Indigenous community-building, as these shape the urban Indigenous experience with COVID-19. Mindful of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, we highlight the perspectives of Indigenous organizations which are the lifeline of urban Indigenous communities, focusing on challenges that miscounting poses to data collection and information sharing, and the exacerbation of intersectional discrimination and human rights infringements specific to the urban context. We include Indigenous critiques of the implications of structural oppressions exposed by COVID-19, and the resulting recommendations which have emerged from Indigenous urban adaptations to lockdown isolation, the provision of safety, and delivery of services grounded in Indigenous initiatives and traditional practices.","Howard-Bobiwash, H.

In one subject, just four IgG lineages accounted for 93.5% of the response, including an amino (N)-terminal domain (NTD)–directed antibody that was protective against lethal viral challenge. Genetic, structural, and functional characterization of a multidonor class of “public” antibodies revealed an NTD epitope that is recurrently mutated among emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

The reported rate of secondary infections was quite low in previous studies. The objectives of our study were to investigate the rate of secondary infections, risk factors for secondary infections and risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 critically ill patients. METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective study in mechanically ventilated critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to our Critical Care Unit (CCU). We recorded the patients' demographic data; clinical data; microbiology data and incidence of secondary infection during CCU stay, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and nosocomial bacteremia (primary and secondary). RESULTS: A total of 107 patients with a mean age 62.2 ± 10.6 years were included. Incidence of secondary infection during CCU stay was 43.0% (46 patients), including nosocomial bacteremia (34 patients) and VAP (35 patients). Age was related to development of secondary infection (65.2 ± 7.3 vs. 59.9 ± 12.2 years, p=0.007). Age &#8805; 65 years and secondary infection were independent predictors of mortality (OR=2.692, 95% CI 1.068-6.782, p<0.036; and OR=3.658, 95% CI 1.385- 9.660, p=0.009, respectively).

Two indicators, i.e., the expected number of newly infected individuals and the newly infected individuals per infector entry, were proposed to demonstrate the extent of achievable infection risk reduction levels by implementing possible preventive measures. A no-prevention scenario produced 1.5-1.7 newly infected individuals per infector entry, whereas a combination of cooperative preventive measures by organizers and the spectators achieved a 99% risk reduction, corresponding to 0.009-0.012 newly infected individuals per infector entry. The expected number of newly infected individuals was calculated as 0.005 for the combination of cooperative preventive scenarios with the crude probability of a spectator being an infector of 1 × 10-5. Based on our estimates, a combination of cooperative preventions between organizers and spectators is required to prevent a viral spread at the Tokyo Olympic/Paralympic Games. Further, under the assumption that society accepts < 10 newly infected persons traced to events held during the entire Olympic/Paralympic Games, we propose a crude probability of infectors of < 5 × 10-5 as a benchmark for the suppression of the infection. This is the first study to develop a model that can assess the infection risk among spectators due to exposure pathways at a mass gathering event.","Murakami, Michio; Miura, Fuminari; Kitajima, Masaaki; Fujii, Kenkichi; Yasutaka, Tetsuo; Iwasaki, Yuichi; Ono, Kyoko; Shimazu, Yuzo; Sorano, Sumire; Okuda, Tomoaki; Ozaki, Akihiko; Katayama, Kotoe; Nishikawa, Yoshitaka; Kobashi, Yurie; Sawano, Toyoaki; Abe, Toshiki; Saito, Masaya M; Tsubokura, Masaharu; Naito, Wataru; Imoto, Seiya",Microb Risk Anal,,841

Little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and well-being of youth with chronic pain and their families. We conducted a longitudinal, mixed-methods study to characterize early adaptation to the COVID-19 pandemic among 250 families of youth (ages 12-21 years) diagnosed with chronic headache (64%) or other chronic pain conditions (36%) and to determine whether direct exposures to COVID-19 and secondary economic stress modified symptom trajectories. Youth and parents reported on pain interference, anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms at 4 waves of data collection from April 2020 to July 2020. We also collected qualitative data on the impact of the pandemic on the youth's pain problem. Nearly half of our sample (49.6%) experienced direct exposures to COVID-19. Secondary economic stress was also common, affecting 44.4% of families. Symptom trajectories for pain, insomnia, depression, and anxiety remained stable or improved for most participants, indicating adaptive adjustment. However, overall symptom burden was high with persistent and clinically elevated depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms common among youth and parents. Direct exposures to COVID-19 did not modify symptom trajectories. However, youth pain interference and parent insomnia worsened in families who experienced secondary economic stress. Qualitative data revealed perceived benefits and harms from school closures on the youth's pain problem. Our findings of high symptom burden suggest that pediatric pain clinicians should offer distance assessment and treatment (eg, through telemedicine) to avoid pandemic-related disruptions in pain care.","Law, Emily F; Zhou, Chuan; Seung, Fiona; Perry, Frankie; Palermo, Tonya M",Pain,,841

318388,"[Typical case analysis of COVID-19 cluster epidemic in Shaanxi, 2020]",2020,"The development of a ""cytokine storm"", characteristic of severe COVID-19 forms, can be defined as a state of uncontrolled release of a large number of inflammatory mediators. The attachment of SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is considered a process that triggers complex molecular interactions that lead to hyperinflammation. In its turn, it is realized through several systems: renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, kallikrein-kinin and a complement system. Knowledge of these mechanisms suggests potential therapeutic interventions that can be targeted by existing therapeutic agents to counter the cytokine storm and treat the acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with COVID-19. The aim of the review article is to summarize the currently known data on the molecular processes underlying the uncontrolled ""cytokine storm"" in the patients with severe COVID-19, and possible options for their pharmacological correction. Materials and methods. The data base was represented by such systems as Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, Elibrary, Google-Academy. A search was carried out for the following keywords and combinations: COVID-19, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, bradykinin, complement system, hyaluronic acid, pharmacotherapy. Results. The development of a ""cytokine storm"" in COVID-19 is mediated by pathogenetic changes in the body in response to the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell. In the RAAS, suppression of ACE2 leads to a decrease in its ability to degrade ATII, which, on the one hand, leads to a decrease in the amount of AT1-7, and, on the other hand, to the effect of ATII on AT1R with the subsequent development of vasoconstriction and lung damage. The disturbances in the kallikrein-kinin system are associated, on the one hand, with the increased expression of kallikrein and an increase in the formation of bradykinin and its metabolite des-Arg 9-bradykinin. On the other hand, the disturbances are associated with the suppression of the expression of the C1-esterase inhibitor which prevents the formation of kallikrein, and impaired inactivation of des-Arg 9-bradykinin under the action of ACE 2. The nucleocapsid protein SARS-CoV-2 triggers the activation of the complement system through the lectin pathway. It leads to the production of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, which stimulate the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Proinflammatory cytokines are potent inducers of the HAS 2 gene in the endothelium, which encodes the membrane enzymes of hyaluronate synthase. The sweating of the fluid into the alveoli caused by the ""bradykinin storm"" in combination with the overproduction of hyaluronic acid, which accumulates water 1000 times its own mass, can lead to the formation of a dense jelly-like substance that prevents gas exchange. Conclusion. Promising areas of pharmacotherapy for ""cytokine storm"" are associated with its impact on the dysfunction of the listed above systems. However, the efficacy and safety of most drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, is to be studied through carefully designed clinical trials.","Petrov, V. I.; Amosov, A. A.; Gerasimenko, A.

Although still debated, an increase in D-dimer has been proposed as a first-line hemostasis test associated with thromboembolic risk and unfavorable prognosis. We aim to systematically and comprehensively evaluate the association between thrombin generation parameters and the inflammatory and hypercoagulable state, as well as their prognostic value in COVID-19 patients. A total of 127 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, 24 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative pneumonia and 12 healthy subjects were included. Clinical characteristics, thrombin generation triggered by tissue factor with and without soluble thrombomodulin, and also by silica, as well as other biochemical parameters were assessed. Despite the frequent use of heparin, COVID-19 patients had similar thrombin generation to healthy controls. In COVID-19 patients, the thrombin generation lag-time positively correlated with markers of cell lysis (LDH), inflammation (CRP, IL-6) and coagulation (D-dimer), while the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) inversely correlated with D-dimer and LDH, and positively correlated with fibrinogen levels. Patients with more prolonged lag-time and decreased ETP had higher peak ISTH-DIC scores, and had more severe disease (vascular events and death). The ROC curve and Kaplan Meier estimate indicated that the D-dimer/ETP ratio was associated with in-hospital mortality (HR 2.5; p = 0.006), and with the occurrence of major adverse events (composite end-point of vascular events and death) (HR 2.38; p = 0.004). The thrombin generation ETP and lag-time variables correlate with thromboinflammatory markers, and the D-dimer/ETP ratio can predict major adverse events in COVID-19.","de la Morena-Barrio, María Eugenia; Bravo-Pérez, Carlos; Miñano, Antonia; de la Morena-Barrio, Belén; Fernandez-Perez, María Piedad; Bernal, Enrique; Gómez-Verdu, José Miguel; Herranz, María Teresa; Vicente, Vicente; Corral, Javier; Lozano, María Luisa",Sci Rep,,841

In addition, many patients with COVID-19 infection have suffered liver damage which might contribute to a worse prognosis. We conducted a clinical epidemiological analysis to investigate the association of overweight/obesity and abnormal liver function (ALF) with hospitalized duration in patients infected with COVID-19. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with diagnosed COVID-19 (22 women & 36 men; average age: 49.2 ± 13.1 yr) were included, and their clinical data were collected at The Second Affiliated and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang. Overweight/obesity was determined as body mass index (BMI) &#8805;24 kg/m2, ALF was determined as alanine aminotransferase >40 U/L, and prolonged hospitalization was lasting more than the median value of the hospitalized days (19 days) in this population. RESULTS: The proportions of prolonged hospitalization were elevated in patients with overweight/obesity and ALF compared with those without overweight/obesity (62.1% versus 26.1%, P = 0.010) and those without ALF (70.6% versus 41.5%, P = 0.043). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the hospitalized duration was increased from the patients with neither overweight/obesity nor ALF to those with either overweight/obesity or ALF, and to those with both of overweight/obesity and ALF (mean with 95% confidence interval: 16.4 [14.5-18.3] versus 25.3 [21.6-29.1] versus 28.3 [24.6-32.0], P for trend = 0.001).

The high mortality in African-Americans and males, in general, raises the concern for a possible X-linked mediated process that could affect the viral pathogenesis and the immune system. We hypothesized that G6PD, the most common X-linked enzyme deficiency, associated with redox status, may have a role in severity of pneumonia. Retrospective chart review was performed in hospitalized patients with COVID19 pneumonia needing supplemental oxygen. A total of 17 patients were evaluated: six with G6PD deficiency (G6PDd) and 11 with normal levels. The two groups (normal and G6PDd) were comparable in terms of age, sex, co-morbidities, and laboratory parameters-LDH, IL-6, CRP, and ferritin, respectively. Thirteen patients needed ventilatory support ; 8 in the normal group and 5 in the G6PDd group (72% vs.83%). The main differences indicating increasing severity in normal vs. G6PDd groups included G6PD levels (12.2 vs. 5.6, P = 0.0002), PaO2/FiO2 ratio (159 vs. 108, P = 0.05), days on mechanical ventilation (10.25 vs. 21 days P = 0.04), hemoglobin level (10 vs. 8.1 P = 0.03), and hematocrit (32 vs. 26 P = 0.015). Only one patient with G6PDd died; 16 were discharged home. Our clinical series ascribes a possible biological role for G6PDd in SARS-CoV2 viral proliferation.

Elevated biomarkers of coagulation (fibrinogen and D-dimer) and inflammation (c-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin) are associated with poor outcome in SARS-CoV-2. Whether the time-course of fibrinogen, D-dimer, CRP and ferritin is associated with the occurrence of pulmonary thromboembolism in SARS-CoV-2 patients is unknown. We hypothesise that patients on mechanical ventilation with SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical pulmonary thromboembolism have lower concentrations of fibrinogen and higher D-dimer, CRP, and ferritin concentrations over time compared to patients without a clinical pulmonary thromboembolism. METHODS: In a prospective study, fibrinogen, D-dimer, CRP and ferritin were measured daily. Clinical suspected pulmonary thromboembolism was either confirmed or excluded based on computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or by transthoracic ultrasound (TTU) (i.e., right-sided cardiac thrombus). In addition, patients who received therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator were included when clinical instability in suspected pulmonary thromboembolism did not allow CTPA. Serial data were analysed using a mixed-effects linear regression model, and models were adjusted for known risk factors (age, sex, APACHE-II score, body mass index), biomarkers of coagulation and inflammation, and anticoagulants. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were considered to suffer from pulmonary thromboembolism ((positive CTPA (n = 27), TTU positive (n = 1), therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (n = 3)), and eight patients with negative CTPA were included. After adjustment for known risk factors and anticoagulants, patients with, compared to those without, clinical pulmonary thromboembolism had lower average fibrinogen concentration of - 0.9 g/L (95% CI: - 1.6 - - 0.1) and lower average ferritin concentration of - 1045 mug/L (95% CI: - 1983 - - 106) over time. D-dimer and CRP average concentration did not significantly differ, 561 mug/L (- 6212-7334) and 27 mg/L (- 32-86) respectively. Ferritin lost statistical significance, both in sensitivity analysis and after adjustment for fibrinogen and D-dimer. CONCLUSION: Lower average concentrations of fibrinogen over time were associated with the presence of clinical pulmonary thromboembolism in patients at the Intensive Care, whereas D-dimer, CRP and ferritin were not. Lower concentrations over time may indicate the consumption of fibrinogen related to thrombus formation in the pulmonary vessels.","Mulder, M. M. G.; Brandts, L.; Bruggemann, R. A.

Mass fractions of metals, including Ag, Cd, and Pb, and of one metalloid, Sb, higher than their crustal abundance, were observed within the entire Weser Basin. Isotope-amount ratio n(87Sr)/n(86Sr) and ÎµNd ranged from 0.71182 ± 0.00005 to 0.72880 ± 0.00009 and -11.3 ± 0.3 to -21.0 ± 0.3, respectively. n(206Pb)/n(204Pb), n(207Pb)/n(204Pb), and n(208Pb)/n(204Pb) ranged from 18.226 ± 0.008 to 18.703 ± 0.012, 15.613 ± 0.007 to 15.653 ± 0.012 and 38.14 ± 0.02 to 38.84 ± 0.02, respectively. Sr and Nd isotope compositions reflected primarily a mixture of natural materials derived from the Weser Basin. Pb isotope signatures indicated strong anthropogenic influences in the middle-lower Weser region. Pb isotopic compositions in the sediments from the Aller (tributary of the Weser) and its tributary suggested influence from historical Pb-Zn ore mining in the Harz Mountains that might contribute to the observed elevated mass fractions of Ag, Cd, Sb and Pb in that region. K-means cluster and principal component analysis of the Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope data yielded results consistent with their isotope systematics, supporting statistical analysis as an unsupervised tool in isotope fingerprinting studies. Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic signatures in the sediments of the Weser were distinctively different from those of another major river discharging into the North Sea, the Elbe. This suggested that this Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope dataset can be used to distinguish riverine input of sediment materials and metals between the two rivers, thereby assessing their individual contribution to materials transported into the North Sea.","Deng, Feifei; Hellmann, Steffen; Zimmermann, Tristan; Pröfrock, Daniel",Sci Total Environ,,841

If confirmed, this could have far-reaching consequences for public health and for pandemic control strategies. In this paper, we argue that a comprehensive and more nuanced analysis is required to test this hypothesis, taking into consideration both environmental dynamics and the persistence of viral infectivity. First, we examine the evidence regarding the presence of the virus in stools and sewage. Then we discuss the current framework of disease transmission through water and excreta and how the transmission of a respiratory disease fits into it. Against this background, we propose a framework to test the faecal-oral hypothesis, unpacking the different environmental routes from faeces to the mouth of a susceptible person. This framework should not be seen as a confirmation of the hypothesis but rather as an expanded view of its complexities, which could help shaping an agenda for research into a number of unanswered questions.

However, no studies have used CPT codes in administrative claims databases to identify subjects who have received MTM services. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of MTM services provided, using CPT codes identified in an administrative dataset. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a subset of Medicare Part D individuals from the IBM MarketScan Medicare Supplemental Research Databases (2009-2015). Researchers identified beneficiaries who received MTM services using CPT codes 99605, 99606, and 99607. RESULTS: Of the 16,483,709 individuals in the dataset, only 3,291 had CPT codes indicating that they received MTM services, representing an overall prevalence of 0.020%. CONCLUSIONS: The use of CPT codes as an indicator of MTM service provision resulted in far lower MTM utilization rates than in published literature. Reliance on CPT codes to identify MTM services in administrative claims is not recommended, given that it limited the researchers' ability to properly identify patient receipt of such services. More accurate methodologies are warranted for identifying MTM use and its effects on patient outcomes.

480436,[COVID-19 complicated with DIC: 2 cases report and literatures review],2020,"Tandem mass tag (TMT) is a multiplexing technology widely-used in proteomic research. It enables relative quantification of proteins from multiple biological samples in a single mass spectrometry run with high efficiency and high throughput. However, experiments often require more biological replicates or conditions than can be accommodated by a single run, and involve multiple TMT mixtures and multiple runs. Such larger-scale experiments combine sources of biological and technical variation in patterns that are complex, unique to TMT-based workflows, and challenging for the downstream statistical analysis. These patterns cannot be adequately characterized by statistical methods designed for other technologies, such as label-free proteomics or transcriptomics. This manuscript proposes a general statistical approach for relative protein quantification in mass spectrometry-based experiments with TMT labeling. It is applicable to experiments with multiple conditions, multiple biological replicate runs and multiple technical replicate runs, and unbalanced designs. It is based on a flexible family of linear mixed-effects models that handle complex patterns of technical artifacts and missing values. The approach is implemented in MSstatsTMT, a freely available open-source R/Bioconductor package compatible with data processing tools such as Proteome Discoverer, MaxQuant, OpenMS and SpectroMine. Evaluation on a controlled mixture, simulated datasets, and three biological investigations with diverse designs demonstrated that MSstatsTMT balanced the sensitivity and the specificity of detecting differentially abundant proteins, in particular in large-scale experiments with multiple biological mixtures.","Huang, Ting; Choi, Meena; Tzouros, Manuel; Golling, Sabrina; Pandya, Nikhil Janak; Banfai, Balazs; Dunkley, Tom; Vitek, Olga",Mol. cell. proteomics,,841

The interurban multi-agent EP strategy, as a key component of this mechanism, includes the spontaneous EP model, the superior leading EP model, and the collaborative EP model. In this study, firstly, the theoretical mechanism of the interurban multi-agent EP strategy was analyzed. Then, we proposed a three-party differential game model including factors such as the risk coefficient for the virus infection and EP experience teaching. Finally, prevention strategies, prevention efficiency, and prevention losses were compared under the three models based on theoretical analysis and numerical analysis. The results of this study are as follows. COVID-19 EP should be guided by a model of central government (CG) leadership, interurban collaboration, and social participation. The CG and urban governments (UGs) should comprehensively carry out COVID-19 EP from various aspects, including EP experience teaching, mass EP comfort, the utilization rate of EP funds, and the ability to implement strategies. During the course of the COVID-19 EP, when the CG and UGs transition from spontaneous EP model to a higher-level EP model, the UG's EP efforts will be enhanced. Under the collaborative EP model, the CG and UGs undergo the highest levels of EP effort. Compared with spontaneous EP model, the superior leading EP model can promote a Pareto improvement for all parties. From the perspective of total loss, the collaborative EP model is superior to the other two EP models. This study not only provides practical guidance for coordinating interurban relationships and enabling multi-agents to fully form joint forces, but also provides theoretical support for the establishment of an interurban joint EP mechanism under unified leadership.","Yin, Shi; Zhang, Nan",Nonlinear Dyn,,841
521690,[Contagiousness and secondary attack rate of 2019 novel coronavirus based on cluster epidemics of COVID-19 in Guangzhou],2020,"To enhance the effectiveness of epidemic prevention (EP) in urban sustainability transformation, joint prevention and control mechanism should be established to prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic. The interurban multi-agent EP strategy, as a key component of this mechanism, includes the spontaneous EP model, the superior leading EP model, and the collaborative EP model. In this study, firstly, the theoretical mechanism of the interurban multi-agent EP strategy was analyzed. Then, we proposed a three-party differential game model including factors such as the risk coefficient for the virus infection and EP experience teaching. Finally, prevention strategies, prevention efficiency, and prevention losses were compared under the three models based on theoretical analysis and numerical analysis. The results of this study are as follows. COVID-19 EP should be guided by a model of central government (CG) leadership, interurban collaboration, and social participation. The CG and urban governments (UGs) should comprehensively carry out COVID-19 EP from various aspects, including EP experience teaching, mass EP comfort, the utilization rate of EP funds, and the ability to implement strategies. During the course of the COVID-19 EP, when the CG and UGs transition from spontaneous EP model to a higher-level EP model, the UG's EP efforts will be enhanced. Under the collaborative EP model, the CG and UGs undergo the highest levels of EP effort. Compared with spontaneous EP model, the superior leading EP model can promote a Pareto improvement for all parties. From the perspective of total loss, the collaborative EP model is superior to the other two EP models. This study not only provides practical guidance for coordinating interurban relationships and enabling multi-agents to fully form joint forces, but also provides theoretical support for the establishment of an interurban joint EP mechanism under unified leadership.","Yin, Shi; Zhang, Nan",Nonlinear Dyn,,841

METHODS: Patients in inpatient or outpatient psychiatric treatment received a questionnaire, examining psychological distress and psychiatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: More than half of the patients indicated that the state of emergency had a negative impact on their mental illness. Severely ill patients were more affected. CONCLUSION: Patients with mental illness are a particularly vulnerable group in the current crisis. Psychiatric and psychotherapeutic care needs to be adapted accordingly; the specific burden and distress needs to be examined actively in patients from all diagnostic groups.","Frank, Andreas; Hörmann, Sophia; Krombach, Julia; Fatke, Bastian; Holzhüter, Fabian; Frank, Wolfgang; Sondergeld, Rebecca; Förstl, Hans; Hölzle, Patricia",Psychiatr Prax,,841
595100,Informing antimicrobial management in the context of COVID-19: understanding the longitudinal dynamics of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin,2021-09-08,"The gastrointestinal and respiratory systems are colonized by a complex ecosystem of microorganisms called the microbiota. These microorganisms co-evolved over millions of years with the host, creating a symbiotic relationship that is fundamental for promoting host homeostasis by producing bioactive metabolites and antimicrobial molecules, and regulating the immune and inflammatory responses. Imbalance in the abundance, diversity, and function of the gut microbiota (known as dysbiosis) have been shown to increase host susceptibility to infections in the lungs, suggesting crosstalk between these organs. This crosstalk is now referred to as the gut-lung axis. Hence, the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics for modulation of gut microbiota has been studied based on their effectiveness in reducing the duration and severity of respiratory tract infections, mainly owing to their effects on preventing pathogen colonization and modulating the immune system. This review discusses the role and responses of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in the gut-lung axis in the face of lung infections.","Cruz, Clênio Silva; Ricci, Mayra Fernanda; Vieira, Angélica Thomaz",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.724033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34557097/,841

688128,[A multicenter prospective cohort study of Xuebijing injection in the treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019].,2021-07-01,"Objectives Serum levels of potassium (K+) seem significantly lower in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an unknown clinical translation. The objective was to investigate whether hypokalemia acts as a biomarker of severity in COVID-19 pneumonia, and associates with major clinical outcomes. Methods Retrospective cohort study of inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia (March 3 - May 2, 2020). Patients were categorized according to nadir levels of K + in the first 72 hours of admission: hypokalemia (K+ ≤3.5 mmol/L) and normokalemia (>3.5 mmol/L). Main outcomes were all-cause mortality and need of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), analyzed by multiple logistic regression (OR; 95%CI). Results 306 patients were enrolled. Ninety-four patients (30.7%) had hypokalemia, showing at baseline significantly higher comorbidity (Charlson index ≥3, 30.0% vs. 16.3%)(p = 0.02), CURB65 scores (1.5(0.0-3.0) vs. 1.0(0.0-2.0))(p = 0.04), and some inflammatory parameters. After adjustment for confounders, hypokalemia was independently associated with requiring IMV during the admission (OR 8.98; 95%CI 2.54-31.74). Mortality was 15.0% (n = 46) and was not influenced by low K + . Hypokalemia was associated with longer hospital and ICU stay. Conclusions Hypokalemia is prevalent in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Hypokalemia is an independent predictor of IMV requirement and seems to be a sensitive biomarker of severe progression of COVID-19.","Moreno-Pérez, Oscar; Leon-Ramirez, Jose-Manuel; Fuertes-Kenneally, Laura; Perdiguero, Miguel; Andres, Mariano; Garcia-Navarro, Mar; Ruiz-Torregrosa, Paloma; Boix, Vicente; Gil, Joan; Merino, Esperanza",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.09.033; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220307499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32950739/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220307499?v=s5,841
