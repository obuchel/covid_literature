959,Oral health in China – trends and challenges,2011-01-11,"For a long time, oral disease is one of the major problems of the public health for its high prevalence and incidence throughout the world, which is especially true for low-income populations. Since China's economic reform in 1978, great changes have taken place in China. These changes have significant impact on and have been reflected in oral disease trends in China. This paper provides an overview and assessment of the oral health status in China. It focuses on changes in the nation's demographic profile, in the marketplace, the oral disease status and trends. The paper also suggests some possible measures and strategies for bettering oral health in future China.","Hu, De-yu; Hong, Xiao; Li, Xue",Int J Oral Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3469869/,251
1047,Brain Microbial Populations in HIV/AIDS: α-Proteobacteria Predominate Independent of Host Immune Status,2013-01-23,"The brain is assumed to be a sterile organ in the absence of disease although the impact of immune disruption is uncertain in terms of brain microbial diversity or quantity. To investigate microbial diversity and quantity in the brain, the profile of infectious agents was examined in pathologically normal and abnormal brains from persons with HIV/AIDS [HIV] (n = 12), other disease controls [ODC] (n = 14) and in cerebral surgical resections for epilepsy [SURG] (n = 6). Deep sequencing of cerebral white matter-derived RNA from the HIV (n = 4) and ODC (n = 4) patients and SURG (n = 2) groups revealed bacterially-encoded 16 s RNA sequences in all brain specimens with α-proteobacteria representing over 70% of bacterial sequences while the other 30% of bacterial classes varied widely. Bacterial rRNA was detected in white matter glial cells by in situ hybridization and peptidoglycan immunoreactivity was also localized principally in glia in human brains. Analyses of amplified bacterial 16 s rRNA sequences disclosed that Proteobacteria was the principal bacterial phylum in all human brain samples with similar bacterial rRNA quantities in HIV and ODC groups despite increased host neuroimmune responses in the HIV group. Exogenous viruses including bacteriophage and human herpes viruses-4, -5 and -6 were detected variably in autopsied brains from both clinical groups. Brains from SIV- and SHIV-infected macaques displayed a profile of bacterial phyla also dominated by Proteobacteria but bacterial sequences were not detected in experimentally FIV-infected cat or RAG1(−/−) mouse brains. Intracerebral implantation of human brain homogenates into RAG1(−/−) mice revealed a preponderance of α-proteobacteria 16 s RNA sequences in the brains of recipient mice at 7 weeks post-implantation, which was abrogated by prior heat-treatment of the brain homogenate. Thus, α-proteobacteria represented the major bacterial component of the primate brain’s microbiome regardless of underlying immune status, which could be transferred into naïve hosts leading to microbial persistence in the brain.","Branton, William G.; Ellestad, Kristofor K.; Maingat, Ferdinand; Wheatley, B.

2327,Assessing worldwide research activity on probiotics in pediatrics using Scopus database: 1994–2014,2016-07-25,"BACKGROUND: A wide variety of probiotic products has been introduced into the market in the past decade. Research trends and activity on probiotics help understand how these products were evolved and their potential future role in medicine. The objective of this study was to assess the research activity on probiotics in pediatrics using bibliometric indicators and network visualization. METHODS: Original and review articles on probiotics in pediatrics published worldwide were retrieved from SciVerse, Scopus (1994–2014) and analyzed. VOSviewer was used for network visualization. RESULTS: The total number of documents published on probiotics in pediatrics was 2817. Research activity on probiotics in pediatrics showed approximately 90- fold increase during the study period. Approximately 22 % of published articles originated from USA and has the greatest share, however, Finland ranked first when data were stratified by population or income. The most productive institution in this field was Turku University in Finland with 82 (2.91 %) articles. Half of the prolific authors were also from Finland. Most of the published research activity appeared in Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. Most frequently encountered title terms include nutrition, infant formula, necrotizing enetrocolitis, allergy, and diarrhea. The total number of citations for the retreived documents documents was 70991, and the average citation per article was 25.20. CONCLUSIONS: Interest in probiotic research and its potential benefits in pediatric ailments is relatively recent but significantly increasing. Bibliometric analysis can be used as an indicator of the importance and growth of probiotic use in pediatrics.","Sweileh, Waleed M.; Shraim, Naser Y.; Al-Jabi, Samah W.; Sawalha, Ansam F.; Rahhal, Belal; Khayyat, Rasha A.; Zyoud, Sa’ed H.",World Allergy Organ J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4960683/,251
2494,IDO-orchestrated crosstalk between pDCs and Tregs inhibits autoimmunity,2016-12-11,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) have been shown to both mediate and prevent autoimmunity, and the regulation of their immunogenic versus tolerogenic functions remains incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that, compared to other cells, pDCs are the major expressors of Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in steady-state lymph nodes (LNs). IDO expression by LN pDCs was closely dependent on MHCII-mediated, antigen-dependent, interactions with Treg. We further established that IDO production by pDCs was necessary to confer suppressive function to Tregs. During EAE development, IDO expression by pDCs was required for the generation of Tregs capable of dampening the priming of encephalitogenic T cell and disease severity. Thus, we describe a novel crosstalk between pDCs and Tregs: Tregs shape tolerogenic functions of pDCs prior to inflammation, such that pDCs in turn, promote Treg suppressive functions during autoimmunity.","Lippens, Carla; Duraes, Fernanda V.; Dubrot, Juan; Brighouse, Dale; Lacroix, Mathilde; Irla, Magali; Aubry-Lachainaye, Jean-Pierre; Reith, Walter; Mandl, Judith N.; Hugues, Stéphanie",J Autoimmun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127883/,251
2985,"A diagnostic and epidemiologic investigation of acute febrile illness (AFI) in Kilombero, Tanzania",2017-12-29,"INTRODUCTION: In low-resource settings, empiric case management of febrile illness is routine as a result of limited access to laboratory diagnostics. The use of comprehensive fever syndromic surveillance, with enhanced clinical microbiology, advanced diagnostics and more robust epidemiologic investigation, could enable healthcare providers to offer a differential diagnosis of fever syndrome and more appropriate care and treatment. METHODS: We conducted a year-long exploratory study of fever syndrome among patients ≥ 1 year if age, presenting to clinical settings with an axillary temperature of ≥37.5°C and symptomatic onset of ≤5 days. Blood and naso-pharyngeal/oral-pharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens were collected and analyzed, respectively, using AFI and respiratory TaqMan Array Cards (TAC) for multi-pathogen detection of 57 potential causative agents. Furthermore, we examined numerous epidemiologic correlates of febrile illness, and conducted demographic, clinical, and behavioral domain-specific multivariate regression to statistically establish associations with agent detection. RESULTS: From 15 September 2014–13 September 2015, 1007 febrile patients were enrolled, and 997 contributed an epidemiologic survey, including: 14% (n = 139) 1<5yrs, 19% (n = 186) 5-14yrs, and 67% (n = 672) ≥15yrs. AFI TAC and respiratory TAC were performed on 842 whole blood specimens and 385 NP/OP specimens, respectively. Of the 57 agents surveyed, Plasmodium was the most common agent detected. AFI TAC detected nucleic acid for one or more of seven microbial agents in 49% of AFI blood samples, including: Plasmodium (47%), Leptospira (3%), Bartonella (1%), Salmonella enterica (1%), Coxiella burnetii (1%), Rickettsia (1%), and West Nile virus (1%). Respiratory TAC detected nucleic acid for 24 different microbial agents, including 12 viruses and 12 bacteria. The most common agents detected among our surveyed population were: Haemophilus influenzae (67%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (55%), Moraxella catarrhalis (39%), Staphylococcus aureus (37%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36%), Human Rhinovirus (25%), influenza A (24%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Enterovirus (15%) and group A Streptococcus (12%). Our epidemiologic investigation demonstrated both age and symptomatic presentation to be associated with a number of detected agents, including, but not limited to, influenza A and Plasmodium. Linear regression of fully-adjusted mean cycle threshold (C(t)) values for Plasmodium also identified statistically significant lower mean C(t) values for older children (20.8), patients presenting with severe fever (21.1) and headache (21.5), as well as patients admitted for in-patient care and treatment (22.4). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to employ two syndromic TaqMan Array Cards for the simultaneous survey of 57 different organisms to better characterize the type and prevalence of detected agents among febrile patients. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the association between adjusted mean C(t) values for Plasmodium and key clinical and demographic variables, which may further inform clinical decision-making based upon intensity of infection, as observed across endemic settings of sub-Saharan Africa.","Hercik, Christine; Cosmas, Leonard; Mogeni, Ondari D.; Wamola, Newton; Kohi, Wanze; Omballa, Victor; Ochieng, Melvin; Lidechi, Shirley; Bonventure, Juma; Ochieng, Caroline; Onyango, Clayton; Fields, Barry S.; Mfinanga, Sayoki; Montgomery, Joel M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5747442/,251

4317,Vaccinating children against influenza: overall cost-effective with potential for undesirable outcomes,2020-01-14,"BACKGROUND: The present study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of an influenza vaccination program for children in the Netherlands. This requires an evaluation of the long-term impact of such a program on the burden of influenza across all age groups, using a transmission model that accounts for the seasonal variability in vaccine effectiveness and the shorter duration of protection following vaccination as compared to natural infection. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a stochastic dynamic transmission model that has been calibrated to reported GP visits with influenza-like illness in the Netherlands over 11 seasons (2003/2004 to 2014/2015). We analyzed the costs and effects of extending the current program with vaccination of children aged 2–16 years at 50% coverage over 20 consecutive seasons. We measured the effects in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and we adopted a societal perspective. RESULTS: The childhood vaccination program is estimated to have an average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €3944 per QALY gained and is cost-effective in the general population (across 1000 simulations; conventional Dutch threshold of €20,000 per QALY gained). The childhood vaccination program is not estimated to be cost-effective for the target-group itself with an average ICER of €57,054 per QALY gained. Uncertainty analyses reveal that these ICERs hide a wide range of outcomes. Even though introduction of a childhood vaccination program decreases the number of infections, it tends to lead to larger epidemics: in 23.3% of 1000 simulations, the childhood vaccination program results in an increase in seasons with a symptomatic attack rate larger than 5%, which is expected to cause serious strain on the health care system. In 6.4% of 1000 simulations, the childhood vaccination program leads to a net loss of QALYs. These findings are robust across different targeted age groups and vaccination coverages. CONCLUSIONS: Modeling indicates that childhood influenza vaccination is cost-effective in the Netherlands. However, childhood influenza vaccination is not cost-effective when only outcomes for the children themselves are considered. In approximately a quarter of the simulations, the introduction of a childhood vaccination program increases the frequency of seasons with a symptomatic attack rate larger than 5%. The possibility of an overall health loss cannot be excluded.","de Boer, Pieter T.; Backer, Jantien A.; van Hoek, Albert Jan; Wallinga, Jacco",BMC Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6958762/,251
4385,HopPER: an adaptive model for probability estimation of influenza reassortment through host prediction,2020-01-23,"BACKGROUND: Influenza reassortment, a mechanism where influenza viruses exchange their RNA segments by co-infecting a single cell, has been implicated in several major pandemics since 19th century. Owing to the significant impact on public health and social stability, great attention has been received on the identification of influenza reassortment. METHODS: We proposed a novel computational method named HopPER (Host-prediction-based Probability Estimation of Reassortment), that sturdily estimates reassortment probabilities through host tropism prediction using 147 new features generated from seven physicochemical properties of amino acids. We conducted the experiments on a range of real and synthetic datasets and compared HopPER with several state-of-the-art methods. RESULTS: It is shown that 280 out of 318 candidate reassortants have been successfully identified. Additionally, not only can HopPER be applied to complete genomes but its effectiveness on incomplete genomes is also demonstrated. The analysis of evolutionary success of avian, human and swine viruses generated through reassortment across different years using HopPER further revealed the reassortment history of the influenza viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents a novel method for the prediction of influenza reassortment. We hope this method could facilitate rapid reassortment detection and provide novel insights into the evolutionary patterns of influenza viruses.","Yin, Rui; Zhou, Xinrui; Rashid, Shamima; Kwoh, Chee Keong",BMC Med Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6979075/,251
4394,"Pneumonia in Bhutanese children: what we know, and what we need to know",2020-01-25,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the single largest cause of death in under-five children worldwide. We conducted a systematic review to identify the knowledge gaps around childhood pneumonia in Bhutan. METHODS: We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect and Google scholar from conception to 3rd December 2018, World Health Organization, UNICEF, Bhutan’s Ministry of Health and other local databases for relevant reports. We included any report describing pneumonia in Bhutanese children with regards to the burden of the disease, aetiology, related risk factors, clinical and prognostic characteristics, surveillance systems and national preventive strategies. Two review authors identified the records. We summarized the findings narratively. RESULTS: We included 44 records. Although with notable decreasing trends, pneumonia is still accountable for a high burden and mortality rate in Bhutanese children. The national surveillance system focuses mainly on influenza identification but has recently introduced other viral aetiology to monitor. We found very scarce or no data with regard to the bacterial aetiology, related risk factors and clinico-radiological and prognostic characteristics. CONCLUSION: There is a dearth of data regarding the epidemiological, microbiological, clinical and radiological characteristics of pneumonia in children in Bhutan, leading to challenges while implementing evidence-based management and effective national preventive strategies.","Jullien, Sophie; Pradhan, Dinesh; Bassat, Quique",Pneumonia (Nathan),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6982390/,251
4835,American Pediatric Society Presidential Address,1976,"Structural and physiological properties of two mutants of mengovirus, 205 and 280, were compared to those of wild-type virus to understand the molecular basis of changes exhibited in their biological function. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis of wild-type and mutant structural proteins revealed alterations in the isoelectric character of the alpha (1 D) protein of both mutant 205 and 280. These data suggest that alterations in the alpha (1 D) protein may be responsible for the phenotypic changes by the mutants. A delay in detectable virus-specified protein synthesis was exhibited in mutant-infected cells in comparison to wild-type. The amount of RNA synthesized in mutant- and revertant-infected cells was less than that synthesized in wild-type infected cells. Changes in virus-specified macro-molecular synthesis in mutant and revertant-infected cells reflected a decrease in the ability of the viruses to attach to cells.","Anderson, Kevin; Bond, Clifford W.",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086560/,251

Various methods have been developed to analyze protease activity, among which, protease assays based on resonance energy transfer are currently used most widely. However, quantitative methods with relatively higher sensitivity are needed, especially for disease diagnosis at early stages. One of the strategies to achieve higher sensitivity is to implement signal amplification of the protease activity. In this review, we briefly summarize the protease assay methods based on resonance energy transfer, and then elaborate the efforts to develop sensitive protease assays through signal amplification by using enzyme cascades.","Yoon, Hyun Kyung; Jung, Sang Taek; Kim, Jae-Ho; Yoo, Tae Hyeon",Biotechnol Bioprocess Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090753/,251
5547,Virtual autopsy,2013-04-14,"When a chemical or biological agent is suddenly released into a ventilation system, its dispersion needs to be promptly and accurately detected. In this work, an optimization method for sensors layout in air ductwork was presented. Three optimal objectives were defined, i.e. the minimum detection time, minimum contaminant exposure, and minimum probability of undetected pollution events. Genetic algorithm (GA) method was used to obtain the non-dominated solutions of multiobjectives optimization problem and the global optimal solution was selected among all of the non-dominated solutions by ordering solutions method. Since the biochemical attack occurred in a ventilation system was a random process, two releasing scenarios were proposed, i.e. the uniform and the air volume-based probability distribution. It was found that such a probability distribution affected the results of optimal sensors layout and also resulted in different detect time and different probability of undetected events. It was discussed how the objective functions are being compatible and competitive with each other, and how sensor quantity affect the optimal results and computational load. The impact of changes on other parameters was given, i.e. the deposition coefficient, the air volume distribution and the manual releasing. This work presents an angle of air ductwork design for indoor environment protection and expects to help in realizing the optimized sensor system design for sudden contaminant releasing within ventilation systems.","Gao, Jun; Zeng, Lingjie; Cao, Changsheng; Ye, Wei; Zhang, Xu",Build Simul,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091264/,251

RECENT FINDINGS: Many studies continue to show poor compliance with consistent universal precautions, as well as proper hand hygiene. Vaccination rates are suboptimal despite attempts to encourage compliance. With the spread of multi-drug resistant organisms, new techniques of decontamination need to be investigated. SUMMARY: There remains a general lack of information and studies regarding the risks of disease exposure and transmission to EMS providers despite the significance hazards their profession can pose. However, there remains a continued theme throughout the majority of EMS and pre-hospital studies, demonstrating that hand washing and consistent use of personal protective equipment remains a persistent, preventable means of disease exposure and transmission.","Bitely, Colton; Miller, Brian; Glauser, Jonathan",Curr Emerg Hosp Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100409/,251
6963,Multiagent imaging of inflammation and infection with radionuclides,2013-11-23,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to estimate the utility of a preoperative model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score in predicting the prognosis after othotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for chronic severe hepatitis B (CSHB) and explore the prognostic factors. METHODS: The outcome of 137 patients who underwent OLT using donors after cardiac death (DCDs) for CSHB in our center was reviewed retrospectively. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method; the log-rank test was used for univariate analysis; and the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for prognostic factors screening. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 33.6% (46/137); and 1-month, 6-month, 1-year, and 5-year patient survival rates were 75.8, 72.0, 71.0, and 60.1%, respectively. Most patients (33/46) died during the first month after OLT. The area under the curve values generated by the receiver operating characteristics curves were 0.82 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72–0.92] and 0.68 (95% CI 0.58–0.79), respectively (P < 0.01), for the MELD and CTP models in predicting 1-month mortality after OLT. Patients with a preoperative MELD score <33.8 or a CTP score <12.5 had significantly better prognosis than those with higher scores (P < 0.05). Other mortality predictors include hepatic encephalopathy, preoperative infection, serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dl. CONCLUSIONS: The MELD score was more efficient than the CTP score for evaluating the short-term prognosis in patients with CSHB undergoing OLT using DCDs, which should be taken into consideration during graft allocation.","Xiao, Liang; Fu, Zhi-Ren; Ding, Guo-Shan; Fu, Hong; Ni, Zhi-Jia; Wang, Zheng-Xin; Shi, Xiao-Min; Guo, Wen-Yuan; Ma, Jun",World J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102514/,251

While some VLP vaccines thrive and are readily adopted into the vaccination schedule, others are restrained by regulatory obstacles, proprietary limitations, or finding their niche amongst the crowded vaccine market. Often the necessity to supplant an existing vaccination regimen possesses an immediate obstacle for the development of a VLP vaccine, despite any preclinical advantages identified over the competition. Novelty, adaptability and formulation compatibility may prove invaluable in helping place VLP vaccines at the forefront of vaccination technology. Areas covered: The purpose of this review is to outline the diversity of VLP vaccines, VLP-specific immune responses, and to explore how modern formulation and delivery techniques can enhance the clinical relevance and overall success of VLP vaccines. Expert commentary: The role of formation science, with an emphasis on the diversity of immune responses induced by VLP, is underrepresented amongst clinical trials for VLP vaccines. Harnessing such diversity, particularly through the use of combinations of select excipients and adjuvants, will be paramount in the development of VLP vaccines.","Donaldson, Braeden; Lateef, Zabeen; Walker, Greg F.; Young, Sarah L.; Ward, Vernon K.",Expert Rev Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7103734/,251
7203,Case for Diagnosis,1982-03-11,"These studies were designed to further elucidate the relative contributions of transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms involved in βcasein gene regulation in the mammary epithelial cell line designated COMMA-D and a clonal subline designated HC-11. Primary transcripts were mapped under various hormonal and substratum conditions using the technique of nuclear run-on transcription and single stranded sense and antisense probes spanning the β-casein gene. In the presence of insulin alone very little sense transcription is detectable, but antisense transcription is observed, which originates at least 150 basepairs upstream of the normal start site of transcription and is present regardless of hormonal, cell substratum, cell type, or gene activity. Antisense transcription is also detectable in the 3′ end of the gene. Insulin, glucocorticoids, and PRL are all necessary for a maximal increase in transcription. A 2- to 4-fold increase in transcriptional activity is observed in the presence of insulin and PRL compared to insulin alone, and this is accompanied by a 125-fold increase in the level of β-casein mRNA. All three hormones act synergistically to induce a 10-fold increase in transcriptional activity, but the transcriptional increase across the gene is not equimolar. The 5β half of the gene is transcribed at a level that is 2- to 10-fold lower than that of the 3β half of the gene. These studies reveal a significant transcriptional component to β-casein gene regulation which was not heretofore detected using double stranded cDNA probes representative of only the 3′ half of the gene.","Goodman, Heather S.; Rosen, Jeffrey M.",Mol Endocrinol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107699/,251
7273,"Loss of mitochondrial peptidase Clpp leads to infertility, hearing loss plus growth retardation via accumulation of CLPX, mtDNA and inflammatory factors",2013-12-15,"Microbial infections have long been of concern to scientists using laboratory rodents because of their potential to confound and invalidate research. With the explosion of genetically engineered mice (GEM), new concerns over the impact of microbial agents have emerged because these rodents in many cases are more susceptible to disease than their inbred or outbred counterparts. Moreover, interaction between microbe and host and the resulting manifestation of disease conceivably differ between GEM and their inbred and outbred counterparts. As a result, infections may alter the GEM phenotype and confound interpretation of results and conclusions about mutated gene function. In addition, because GEM are expensive to produce and maintain, contamination by pathogens or opportunists has severe economic consequences. This review addresses how microbial infections may influence phenotype, how immunomodulation of the host as the result of induced mutations may modify host susceptibility to microbial infections, how novel host:microbe interactions have led to the development of new animal models for disease, how phenotype changes have led to the discovery of new pathogens, and new challenges associated with prevention and control of microbial infections in GEM. Although the focus is on naturally occurring infections, extensive literature on the use of GEM in studies of microbial pathogenesis also exists, and the reader is referred to this literature if microbial infection is a suspected culprit in phenotype alteration.","Franklin, Craig L.",ILAR J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108594/,251

10737,Performance of an N95 Filtering Facepiece Particulate Respirator and a Surgical Mask During Human Breathing: Two Pathways for Particle Penetration,2010-07-22,"PURPOSE: The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the most common microdeletion in humans, with highly variable phenotypic expression. Whereas congenital heart defects, palatal anomalies, immunodeficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and neuropsychiatric conditions are observed in over 50% of patients with 22q11DS, a subset of patients present with additional “atypical” findings such as craniosynostosis and anorectal malformations. Recently, pathogenic variants in the CDC45 (Cell Division Cycle protein 45) gene, located within the LCR22A–LCR22B region of chromosome 22q11.2, were noted to be involved in the pathogenesis of craniosynostosis. METHODS: We performed next-generation sequencing on DNA from 15 patients with 22q11.2DS and atypical phenotypic features such as craniosynostosis, short stature, skeletal differences, and anorectal malformations. RESULTS: We identified four novel rare nonsynonymous variants in CDC45 in 5/15 patients with 22q11.2DS and craniosynostosis and/or other atypical findings. CONCLUSION: This study supports CDC45 as a causative gene in craniosynostosis, as well as a number of other anomalies. We suggest that this association results in a condition independent of Meier–Gorlin syndrome, perhaps representing a novel condition and/or a cause of features associated with Baller–Gerold syndrome. In addition, this work confirms that the phenotypic variability observed in a subset of patients with 22q11.2DS is due to pathogenic variants on the nondeleted chromosome.","Unolt, Marta; Kammoun, Molka; Nowakowska, Beata; Graham, Gail E.; Crowley, T.

Edaravone (also known as MCI-186), a free radical scavenger, was approved as an ALS treatment in 2015 in Japan. However, the therapeutic effects of edaravone on patients with ALS outside of Japan are not yet reported. This study aims to investigate effects of edaravone on ALS patients in the Korean population. The study included 22 patients with ALS who were treated with edaravone. Of the 16 patients who finished six cycles of treatment, a mean decline of ALSFRS-R after the treatments was 5.75 ± 6.07 points and the average change of FVC was − 8.7 ± 17.0%.

11575,De Profundis II,2020-05-15,"Significant concerns have arisen over the past 3 y from the increased global spread of the mosquito-borne flavivirus, Zika. Accompanying this spread has been an increase in cases of the devastating birth defect microcephaly as well as of Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults in many affected countries. Currently there is no vaccine or therapy for this infection; however, we sought to develop a combination approach that provides more rapid and durable protection than traditional vaccination alone. A novel immune-based prophylaxis/therapy strategy entailing the facilitated delivery of a synthetic DNA consensus prME vaccine along with DNA-encoded anti-ZIKV envelope monoclonal antibodies (dMAb) were developed and evaluated for antiviral efficacy. This immediate and persistent protection strategy confers the ability to overcome shortcomings inherent with conventional active vaccination or passive immunotherapy. A collection of novel dMAbs were developed which were potent against ZIKV and could be expressed in serum within 24–48 h of in vivo administration. The DNA vaccine, from a previous development, was potent after adaptive immunity was developed, protecting against infection, brain and testes pathology in relevant mouse challenge models and in an NHP challenge. Delivery of potent dMAbs protected mice from the same murine viral challenge within days of delivery. Combined injection of dMAb and the DNA vaccine afforded rapid and long-lived protection in this challenge model, providing an important demonstration of the advantage of this synergistic approach to pandemic outbreaks.","Choi, Hyeree; Kudchodkar, Sagar B.; Reuschel, Emma L.; Asija, Kanika; Borole, Piyush; Agarwal, Sangya; Van Gorder, Lucas; Reed, Charles C.; Gulendran, Gayathri; Ramos, Stephanie; Broderick, Kate E.; Kim, J Joseph; Ugen, Kenneth E.; Kobinger, Gary; Siegel, Don L.; Weiner, David B.; Muthumani, Kar",Hum Vaccin Immunother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7227701/,251

AMPs have either antimicrobial or anticancer activities. Indeed, cationic AMPs are able to disrupt microbial cell membranes by interacting with negatively charged phospholipids. Moreover, several peptides are capable to trigger cytotoxicity of human cancer cells by binding to negatively charged phosphatidylserine moieties which are selectively exposed on the outer surface of cancer cell plasma membranes. In addition, some AMPs, such as LTX-315, have shown to induce release of tumor antigens and potent damage associated molecular patterns by causing alterations in the intracellular organelles of cancer cells. Given the recognized medical need of novel anticancer drugs, AMPs could represent a potential source of effective therapeutic agents, either alone or in combination with other small molecules, in oncology. In this review we summarize and describe the properties and the mode of action of AMPs as well as the strategies to increase their selectivity toward specific cancer cells.","Tornesello, Anna Lucia; Borrelli, Antonella; Buonaguro, Luigi; Buonaguro, Franco Maria; Tornesello, Maria Lina",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7356147/,251

12826,Comparison of the retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell complex thickness in Korean patients with unilateral exfoliation syndrome and healthy subjects,2019-11-12,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1), an endogenous vasoactive peptide, has been found to play an important role in peripheral pain signaling. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are key sensors for extracellular protons and contribute to pain caused by tissue acidosis. It remains unclear whether an interaction exists between ET-1 and ASICs in primary sensory neurons. In this study, we reported that ET-1 enhanced the activity of ASICs in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. In whole-cell voltage-clamp recording, ASIC currents were evoked by brief local application of pH 6.0 external solution in the presence of TRPV1 channel blocker AMG9810. Pre-application with ET-1 (1−100 nM) dose-dependently increased the proton-evoked ASIC currents with an EC(50) value of 7.42 ± 0.21 nM. Pre-application with ET-1 (30 nM) shifted the concentration–response curve of proton upwards with a maximal current response increase of 61.11% ± 4.33%. We showed that ET-1 enhanced ASIC currents through endothelin-A receptor (ET(A)R), but not endothelin-B receptor (ET(B)R) in both DRG neurons and CHO cells co-expressing ASIC3 and ET(A)R. ET-1 enhancement was inhibited by blockade of G-protein or protein kinase C signaling. In current-clamp recording, pre-application with ET-1 (30 nM) significantly increased acid-evoked firing in rat DRG neurons. Finally, we showed that pharmacological blockade of ASICs by amiloride or APETx2 significantly alleviated ET-1-induced flinching and mechanical hyperalgesia in rats. These results suggest that ET-1 sensitizes ASICs in primary sensory neurons via ET(A)R and PKC signaling pathway, which may contribute to peripheral ET-1-induced nociceptive behavior in rats.","Wu, Lei; Liu, Ting-ting; Jin, Ying; Wei, Shuang; Qiu, Chun-yu; Hu, Wang-ping",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468575/,251

Ninety-seven percent of respondents reported that they would have wanted prognostic information at the time of their treatment and 98% of respondents reported that supportive counseling should be offered when prognostic information is given. Patients who had received a more favorable prognostic result were more likely to endorse the usefulness of cytogenetic testing than were patients who had received a less favorable prognostic result. Psychological status did not vary significantly as a function of cytogenetic test result. Prognostic information was important to patients with choroidal melanoma, even in the absence of prophylactic measures which might improve prognosis.","Beran, Tammy M.; McCannel, Tara A.; Stanton, Annette L.; Straatsma, Bradley R.; Burgess, Barry L.",J Genet Couns,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7451024/,251
13136,"Biomarkers of Aging: Prediction of Longevity by Using Age-Sensitive T-Cell Subset Determinations in a Middle-Aged, Genetically Heterogeneous Mouse Population",2001-04-01,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a novel regulator of the renin–angiotensin system that counteracts the adverse effects of angiotensin II. In heart failure patients, elevated plasma ACE2 activity predicted adverse events and greater myocardial dysfunction. We aimed to describe plasma ACE2 activity and its clinical associations in patients with kidney disease. METHODS: Patients recruited from a single centre comprised of chronic kidney disease Stage III/IV (CKD), haemodialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Plasma ACE2 enzyme activity was measured using a fluorescent substrate assay in plasma, collected at baseline and stored at −80°C. Linear regression was performed in both males and females separately to determine the covariates associated with log-transformed ACE2. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) plasma ACE2 activity in pmol/mL/min was 15.9 (8.4–26.1) in CKD (n = 59), 9.2 (3.9–18.2) in haemodialysis (n = 100) and 13.1 (5.7–21.9) in KTR (n = 80; P < 0.01). In male haemodialysis patients, ACE2 activity was 12.1 (6.8–19.6) compared with 4.4 (2.5–10.3) in females (P < 0.01). Log-transformed ACE2 plasma activity was associated with post-haemodialysis systolic blood pressure in females [β-coefficient 0.04, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.01–0.06, P = 0.006]. In males, log-transformed ACE2 plasma activity was associated with B-type natriuretic peptide (β-coefficient 0.39, 95% CI 0.19–0.60, P < 0.001). Plasma ACE2 activity was not associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma ACE2 activity is reduced in haemodialysis patients compared with CKD patients, and in female haemodialysis patients compared with male. The different associations of plasma ACE2 activity between male and female haemodialysis patients indicate that the role of ACE2 in cardiovascular disease may differ by gender.","Roberts, Matthew A.; Velkoska, Elena; Ierino, Francesco L.; Burrell, Louise M.",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7537611/,251
13249,Dante Gatteschi: on the Occasion of His 75th Birthday,2020-10-13,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an economically devastating animal disease. Adapting the field virus to cells is critical to the vaccine production of FMD viruses (FMDV), and heparan sulfate (HS) and Jumonji C-domain-containing protein 6 (JMJD6) are alternative receptors of cell-adapted FMDV. We performed serial passages of FMDV O/SKR/Andong/2010, classified as the O/Mya-98 topotype/lineage and known as a highly virulent strain, to develop a vaccine seed virus. We traced changes in the amino acid sequences of the P1 region, plaque phenotypes, and the receptor usage of the viruses, and then structurally analyzed the mutations. VP3 H56R and D60G mutations were observed in viruses using the HS receptor and led to changes in the hydrogen bonding between VP3 56 and 60. A VP1 P208L mutation was observed in the virus using the JMJD6 receptor during cell adaptation, enabling the interaction with JMJD6 through the formation of a new hydrogen bond with JMJD6 residue 300. Furthermore, VP1 208 was near the VP1 95/96 amino acids, previously reported as critical mutations for JMJD6 receptor interactions. Thus, the mutation at VP1 208 could be critical for cell adaptation related to the JMJD6 receptor and may serve as a basis for mechanism studies on FMDV cell adaptation.","Lee, Gyeongmin; Hwang, Ji-Hyeon; Kim, Aro; Park, Jong-Hyeon; Lee, Min Ja; Kim, Byounghan; Kim, Su-Mi",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7551012/,251
13573,Therapeutic Clowning in Pediatric Practice: A Novel Concept to Think About in India,2020-09-05,"BACKGROUND: Back pain is a common condition that starts early in life and seems to increase markedly during puberty. A systematic review was performed in order to investigate the link between puberty and back pain, using some Bradford Hill criteria for causality. OBJECTIVES: We sought to obtain answers to the following questions: 1) Is there an association between puberty and back pain? If so, how strong is this association? And do the results remain unchanged also when controlling for age and sex? 2) Are the results of the studies consistent? 3) Is there a dose–response, showing a link between the increasing stages of puberty and the subsequent prevalence of back pain? 4) Is there a temporal link between puberty and back pain? DESIGN: A systematic critical literature review. METHODS: Systematic searches were made in March 2014 in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO including longitudinal or cross-sectional studies on back pain for subjects <19 years, written in French or English. The review process followed the AMSTAR recommendations. Interpretation was made using some of the Bradford-Hill criteria for causality. RESULTS: Four articles reporting five studies were included, two of which were longitudinal. 1) Some studies show a weak and others a strong positive association between puberty and back pain, which remains after controlling for age and sex; 2) Results were consistent across the studies; 3) There was a linear increase of back pain according to the stage of puberty 4) Temporality has not been sufficiently studied. CONCLUSION: All our criteria for causality were fulfilled or somewhat fulfilled indicating the possibility of a causal link between puberty and back pain. Future research should focus on specific hypotheses, for example investigating if there could be a hormonal or a biomechanical aspect to the development of back pain at this time of life.

13600,Recommendations by a UK expert panel on an aflibercept treat-and-extend pathway for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration,2020-01-03,"PURPOSE: To study the relationship between macular ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness and visual field defects (VFD) caused by central nervous system (CNS) lesions in children and evaluate the possibility of predicting VFD according to GCC maps. METHODS: The GCC maps of a group of children with VFD due to CNS lesions with respect of the vertical meridian in at least one eye (study group), as well as of children with other neuro-ophthalmological problems and healthy children were presented to two masked evaluators, who were asked to predict the patients’ VFD on the basis of GCC damage: the evaluators classified VFD as normal, hemianopia (homonymous or heteronymous) or diffuse. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were included in the study group, with a median age of 12 years. Fifteen had brain tumours and two epilepsy. The mean MD of the affected hemifields was −26.00 dB (SD 7.89 dB) versus −5.51 dB (SD 3.52 dB) for the nonaffected hemifields, p < 0.001. The mean GCC thickness was of 56.04 μm (SD 11.95 μm) in the affected hemiretinas versus 74.31 μm (SD 10.64 μm) for the non-affected, p < 0.001. Kappa coefficients between VFD and those estimated by the evaluators were 0.705 and 0.658 (p < 0.001) for evaluators 1 and 2. CONCLUSIONS: GCC thickness can reflect damage to the visual pathway and GCC maps may be useful to identify chiasmal and retrochiasmal lesions, since GCC atrophy in most of these cases respects the vertical meridian. GCC maps might be used as a surrogate marker for visual damage in patients unable to perform perimetry.","Noval, S.; Henríquez-Recine, M.

13610,Management of recurrent sebaceous gland carcinoma,2020-01-02,"Some cyanobacteria use light outside the visible spectrum for oxygenic photosynthesis. The far-red light (FRL) region is made accessible through a complex acclimation process that involves the formation of new phycobilisomes and photosystems containing chlorophyll f. Diverse cyanobacteria ranging from unicellular to branched-filamentous forms show this response. These organisms have been isolated from shaded environments such as microbial mats, soil, rock, and stromatolites. However, the full spread of chlorophyll f-containing species in nature is still unknown. Currently, discovering new chlorophyll f cyanobacteria involves lengthy incubation times under selective far-red light. We have used a marker gene to detect chlorophyll f organisms in environmental samples and metagenomic data. This marker, apcE2, encodes a phycobilisome linker associated with FRL-photosynthesis. By focusing on a far-red motif within the sequence, degenerate PCR and BLAST searches can effectively discriminate against the normal chlorophyll a-associated apcE. Even short recovered sequences carry enough information for phylogenetic placement. Markers of chlorophyll f photosynthesis were found in metagenomic datasets from diverse environments around the globe, including cyanobacterial symbionts, hypersaline lakes, corals, and the Arctic/Antarctic regions. This additional information enabled higher phylogenetic resolution supporting the hypothesis that vertical descent, as opposed to horizontal gene transfer, is largely responsible for this phenotype’s distribution.","Antonaru, Laura A.; Cardona, Tanai; Larkum, Anthony W.

Nintedanib is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGF, PDGF, FGF, and TGF-β receptors with proved efficacy in anti-angiogenesis and in treating various types of cancers. In this study, we investigated the effects of nintedanib on keloid fibroblasts in both in vitro and ex vivo models. Keloid fibroblasts were prepared from 54 keloid scar samples in active stages collected from 49 patients. We found that nintedanib (1−4 μM) dose-dependently suppressed cell proliferation, induced G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest, and inhibited migration and invasion of keloid fibroblasts. The drug also significantly inhibited the gene and protein expression of collagen I (COL-1) and III (COL-3), fibronectin (FN), and connective growth factor (CTGF), as well as the gene expression of other pathological factors, such as alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), FK506-binding protein 10 (FKBP10), and heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) in keloid fibroblasts. Furthermore, nintedanib treatment significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of p38, JNK, ERK, STAT3, and Smad, enhanced endocytosis of various growth factor receptors. Using an ex vivo tissue explant model, we showed that nintedanib significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and collagen production. The drug also significantly disrupted microvessel structure ex vivo.

Due to the largely unknown pathophysiological mechanisms downstream the impairment of this transcriptional regulator, a specific treatment is not yet available. Since both haploinsufficiency and hyper-expression of FOXG1 cause diseases in humans, we reasoned that adding a gene under nonnative regulatory sequences would be a risky strategy as opposed to a genome editing approach where the mutated gene is reversed into wild-type. Here, we demonstrate that an adeno-associated viruses (AAVs)-coupled CRISPR/Cas9 system is able to target and correct FOXG1 variants in patient-derived fibroblasts, induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neurons. Variant-specific single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and donor DNAs have been selected and cloned together with a mCherry/EGFP reporter system. Specific sgRNA recognition sequences were inserted upstream and downstream Cas9 CDS to allow self-cleavage and inactivation. We demonstrated that AAV serotypes vary in transduction efficiency depending on the target cell type, the best being AAV9 in fibroblasts and iPSC-derived neurons, and AAV2 in iPSCs. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of mCherry(+)/EGFP(+) transfected cells demonstrated that the mutated alleles were repaired with high efficiency (20–35% reversion) and precision both in terms of allelic discrimination and off-target activity. The genome editing strategy tested in this study has proven to precisely repair FOXG1 and delivery through an AAV9-based system represents a step forward toward the development of a therapy for Rett syndrome.","Croci, Susanna; Carriero, Miriam Lucia; Capitani, Katia; Daga, Sergio; Donati, Francesco; Papa, Filomena Tiziana; Frullanti, Elisa; Lopergolo, Diego; Lamacchia, Vittoria; Tita, Rossella; Giliberti, Annarita; Benetti, Elisa; Niccheri, Francesca; Furini, Simone; Lo Rizzo, Caterina; Conticello, Silvestro Giovanni; Renieri, Alessandra; Meloni, Ilaria",Eur J Hum Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608362/,251

Human γδ T cells recognize and kill transformed cells independently of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction, which is an essential feature of conventional αβ T cells. Vγ9Vδ2 γδ T cells, which prevail in the peripheral blood of healthy adults, are activated by microbial or endogenous tumor-derived pyrophosphates by a mechanism dependent on butyrophilin molecules. γδ T cells expressing other T cell receptor variable genes, notably Vδ1, are more abundant in mucosal tissue. In addition to the T cell receptor, γδ T cells usually express activating natural killer (NK) receptors, such as NKp30, NKp44, or NKG2D which binds to stress-inducible surface molecules that are absent on healthy cells but are frequently expressed on malignant cells. Therefore, γδ T cells are endowed with at least two independent recognition systems to sense tumor cells and to initiate anticancer effector mechanisms, including cytokine production and cytotoxicity. In view of their HLA-independent potent antitumor activity, there has been increasing interest in translating the unique potential of γδ T cells into innovative cellular cancer immunotherapies. Here, we discuss recent developments to enhance the efficacy of γδ T cell-based immunotherapy. This includes strategies for in vivo activation and tumor-targeting of γδ T cells, the optimization of in vitro expansion protocols, and the development of gene-modified γδ T cells.

Diagnosis of patients could be wrong, missed, or delayed if laboratory tests are performed erroneously. However, recognizing the value of correct laboratory test ordering remains underestimated by policymakers and clinicians. Nowadays, artificial intelligence methods such as machine learning and deep learning (DL) have been extensively used as powerful tools for pattern recognition in large data sets. Therefore, developing an automated laboratory test recommendation tool using available data from electronic health records (EHRs) could support current clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop an artificial intelligence–based automated model that can provide laboratory tests recommendation based on simple variables available in EHRs. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the National Health Insurance database between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2013, was performed. We reviewed the record of all patients who visited the cardiology department at least once and were prescribed laboratory tests. The data set was split into training and testing sets (80:20) to develop the DL model. In the internal validation, 25% of data were randomly selected from the training set to evaluate the performance of this model. RESULTS: We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, precision, recall, and hamming loss as comparative measures. A total of 129,938 prescriptions were used in our model. The DL-based automated recommendation system for laboratory tests achieved a significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCmacro and AUROCmicro of 0.76 and 0.87, respectively). Using a low cutoff, the model identified appropriate laboratory tests with 99% sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The developed artificial intelligence model based on DL exhibited good discriminative capability for predicting laboratory tests using routinely collected EHR data. Utilization of DL approaches can facilitate optimal laboratory test selection for patients, which may in turn improve patient safety. However, future study is recommended to assess the cost-effectiveness for implementing this model in real-world clinical settings.","Islam, Md Mohaimenul; Yang, Hsuan-Chia; Poly, Tahmina Nasrin; Li, Yu-Chuan Jack",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7710445/,251
14722,Global Pediatric Research Investigator: Dr. Nadia A. Sam-Agudu,2021-01-14,"Due to the environmental and nutritional benefits of insects, their consumption would be one of the solutions to feed the growing human population. Despite the increasing interest in the use of insects as food and feed, consumer acceptance is the major obstacle to successful implementation in Western countries and we studied the factors that influence consumer acceptance in a group of university students from Germany and the Netherlands. In this exploratory research, a survey was conducted (n = 222). Socio‐demographic and psychological factors were established from a theoretical review. In addition, we elaborated on questions regarding information on the health and environmental benefits of consuming insects. Initially, the data obtained are presented through descriptive statistics. The influence of the socio‐demographic and psychological factors, and the information on the willingness to accept insects as animal feed and human food was analyzed using correlations and multiple linear regressions. Results showed more willingness to accept insects as animal feed than in human food. The acceptance among German and Dutch students seems to be driven by issues similar to those in other European countries, such as visual aspects and knowledge about the benefits. The effect of the information on willingness constitutes an important finding of this study, especially for the use of insects in animal feed, since most of the previous studies have focused on the use of insects as human food. Our data support the need to inform and educate consumers about the environmental and health benefits of entomophagy. We conclude that effective efforts to implement entomophagy could increase the level of familiarity with the insect food and inform (or educate) consumers about its benefits. Insights from this study are useful to address studies focusing on specific segments of possible early adopters and consequently addressing communication strategies in this market segmentation.","Naranjo‐Guevara, Natalia; Fanter, Michelle; Conconi, Anna Maria; Floto‐Stammen, Sonja",Food Sci Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7802571/,251

Microemulsion was used for preparation and cross-linking conjugation. The characteristics of the designed nanocomposite were studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction, UV-visible spectroscopy, Zeta potential and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The prepared SPION@Au-CS-DOX-FA nanoparticles (NPs) were spherical with an average diameter of 102.6 ± 7 nm and displayed an elevated drug loading behavior and sustained drug release capacity. The SPION@Au-CS-DOX-FA NPs revealed long term anti-cancer efficacy due to their cytotoxic effect and apoptotic inducing efficiency in SkBr3 cell lines. Additionally, Real-time PCR outcomes significantly showed an increase in BAK and BAX expression and a decrease in BCL-XL and BCL-2. In vivo results revealed that SPION@Au significantly decreased the tumor size in treated mice through magnetization. In conclusion, prepared SPION@Au-CS-DOX-FA could be a beneficial drug formulation for clinical breast cancer treatment.","Al-Musawi, Sharafaldin; Albukhaty, Salim; Al-Karagoly, Hassan; Almalki, Faizah",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7824182/,251
15138,Vaccine Therapies for Cancer: Then and Now,2021-01-29,"BACKGROUND: Mental health treatment rates are increasing, but the burden of disease has not reduced. Tools to support efficient resource distribution are required. AIM: To investigate whether a person-centred e-health (Target-D) platform matching depression care to symptom severity prognosis can improve depressive symptoms relative to usual care. DESIGN AND SETTING: Stratified individually randomised controlled trial in 14 general practices in Melbourne, Australia, from April 2016 to February 2019. In total, 1868 participants aged 18–65 years who had current depressive symptoms; internet access; no recent change to antidepressant; no current antipsychotic medication; and no current psychological therapy were randomised (1:1) via computer-generated allocation to intervention or usual care. METHOD: The intervention was an e-health platform accessed in the GP waiting room, comprising symptom feedback, priority-setting, and prognosis-matched management options (online self-help, online guided psychological therapy, or nurse-led collaborative care). Management options were flexible, neither participants nor staff were blinded, and there were no substantive protocol deviations. The primary outcome was depressive symptom severity (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) at 3 months. RESULTS: In intention to treat analysis, estimated between- arm difference in mean PHQ-9 scores at 3 months was −0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] = −1.45 to −0.31) favouring the intervention, and −0.59 at 12 months (95% CI = −1.18 to 0.01); standardised effect sizes of −0.16 (95% CI = −0.26 to −0.05) and −0.10 (95% CI = −0.21 to 0.002), respectively. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Matching management to prognosis using a person-centred e-health platform improves depressive symptoms at 3 months compared to usual care and could feasibly be implemented at scale. Scope exists to enhance the uptake of management options.","Fletcher, Susan; Chondros, Patty; Densley, Konstancja; Murray, Elizabeth; Dowrick, Christopher; Coe, Amy; Hegarty, Kelsey; Davidson, Sandra; Wachtler, Caroline; Mihalopoulos, Cathrine; Lee, Yong Yi; Chatterton, Mary Lou; Palmer, Victoria J; Gunn, Jane",Br J Gen Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7846356/,251

16183,"Etiology, Clinical Profile, Evaluation, and Management of Stridor in Children",2021-03-17,"BACKGROUND: Ward-equivalent treatment (StäB), a form of crisis resolution and home treatment in Germany, has been introduced in 2018 as a new model of mental health service delivery for people with an indication for inpatient care. The rapid progress in the field of information and communication technology offers entirely new opportunities for innovative digital mental health care, such as telemedicine, eHealth, or mHealth interventions. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of novel digital forms of service delivery that may contribute to a personalized delivery of StäB and improving clinical and social outcomes as well as reducing direct and indirect costs. METHOD: This work is based on a narrative review. RESULTS: Four primary digital forms of service delivery have been identified that can be used for personalized delivery of StäB: (1) communication, continuity of care, and flexibility through online chat and video call; (2) monitoring of symptoms and behavior in real-time through ecological momentary assessment (EMA); (3) use of multimodal EMA data to generate and offer personalized feedback on subjective experience and behavioral patterns as well as (4) adaptive ecological momentary interventions (EMI) tailored to the person, moment, and context in daily life. CONCLUSION: New digital forms of service delivery have considerable potential to increase the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of crisis resolution, home treatment, and assertive outreach. An important next step is to model and initially evaluate these novel digital forms of service delivery in the context of StäB and carefully investigate their quality from the user perspective, safety, feasibility, initial process and outcome quality as well as barriers and facilitators of implementation.","Rauschenberg, Christian; Hirjak, Dusan; Ganslandt, Thomas; Schulte-Strathaus, Julia C.

Despite its widespread use in common clinical practice, the biochemical effects of O(2)O(3) are still far from being understood, although its chemical properties seem to play a pivotal role in exerting its positive effects on different pathological conditions. Indeed, the effectiveness of O(2)O(3) therapy might be partly due to the moderate oxidative stress produced by O(3) interactions with biological components. O(2)O(3) therapy is widely used as an adjuvant therapeutic option in several pathological conditions characterized by chronic inflammatory processes and immune over-activation, and most musculoskeletal disorders share these pathophysiological processes. The present comprehensive review depicts the state-of-the-art on the mechanisms of action, safety and effectiveness of O(2)O(3) therapy in the complex scenario of the management of musculoskeletal disorders. Taken together, our findings suggest that O(2)O(3) therapy seems to reduce pain and improve functioning in patients affected by low back pain and knee osteoarthritis, as reported by several studies in the literature. However, to date, further studies are warranted to clearly investigate the therapeutic effects of this promising therapy on other musculoskeletal disorders in the field of rehabilitation.","de Sire, Alessandro; Agostini, Francesco; Lippi, Lorenzo; Mangone, Massimiliano; Marchese, Simone; Cisari, Carlo; Bernetti, Andrea; Invernizzi, Marco",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7996934/,251
16661,ECIO 2021 Book of Abstracts,2021-04-07,"ABSTRACT: PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: The integration of cancer-related palliative care is essential to holistic, quality cancer care. While some similarities exist between countries, this manuscript will focus on five differences that impact palliative care for cancer patients including the epidemiology of cancer and related symptoms, cancer-specific integration into care, palliative care education, economic development of the country, and cultural and religious differences. RECENT FINDINGS: The epidemiology of cancer varies around the world resulting in variable symptoms and the need for individualized approaches to palliative care. While palliative care is integrated in some countries, it is lacking in over half of the world, and specific integration into cancer care is virtually absent. Education and training are the key to expansion, and yet oncology-focused palliative care education is lacking or is not well-reported in the literature. To complicate this global lens even further are the economic disparities that exist. Low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs) are resource poor and have the fewest resources and least amount of integration, and yet patients with advanced cancer are over-represented in these countries. Essential to cancer-related palliative care is a tailored approach that addresses cultural and religious differences around the globe. SUMMARY: Palliative care is developing around the globe and yet palliative care specific for cancer patients is in its infancy. Cancer care professionals should (1) understand the epidemiologic differences that exist globally and the impact this has on palliative care, (2) integrate palliative care into the cancer care arena, (3) provide cancer-specific palliative education focused on the cancer trajectory from diagnosis through survivorship and end of life, (4) advocate for LMICs, which suffer from a lack of resources and services, and (5) understand cultural and religious differences that exist to provide holistic and sensitive cancer-related palliative care.","Brant, Jeannine M.; Silbermann, Michael",Curr Oncol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8026388/,251
16765,Drive-by Photoscreening [Letter],2021-04-08,"BACKGROUND: Migrant communities are often underserved by mainstream mental health services resulting in high rates of untreated psychological distress. This collaborative study built on evidence that mindfulness-based interventions delivered in-language and culturally tailored were acceptable and clinically effective for Arabic speakers in Australia. It aimed to establish whether a group mindfulness program produced expected outcomes under normal operational conditions, and to test its scalability and its transferability to Bangla speakers. METHODS: A 5-week mindfulness program was delivered to 15 Arabic-speaking and 8 Bangla-speaking groups in community settings. The mixed-methods evaluation incorporated a pre-post study. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the socio-demographic data, group attendance and home practice. Differences in DASS 21 and K10 scores from pre to post-intervention were tested using the nonparametric sign test for paired samples (two-sided). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the effects of selected sociodemographic variables, group attendance and home practice on clinical outcomes, based on intention to treat. Content analysis was used to examine the qualitative data. RESULTS: The program attracted 168 Arabic speakers and 103 Bangla speakers aged 16 years and over, mostly women. Cultural acceptability was evident in the overall 80% completion rate, with 78% of Arabic speakers and 84% of Bangla speakers retained. Both language groups showed clinically and statistically significant improvements in mental health outcomes on the DASS21 and K10. Thirty new referrals were made to mental health services. Participant feedback emphasised the benefits for their everyday lives. All but one participant reported sharing the mindfulness skills with others. CONCLUSIONS: Across multiple and diverse groups of Arabic and Bangla speakers in Sydney, the community-based group mindfulness program was shown to have high levels of cultural acceptability and relevance. It resulted in clinically and statistically significant improvements in mental health outcomes, facilitated access to mental health care and boosted mental health literacy. This innovative, low-intensity, in-language mental health intervention that was originally developed for Arabic speakers is scalable. It is also transferable—with cultural tailoring—to Bangla speakers.

16960,Long-term experimental evolution of HIV-1 reveals effects of environment and mutational history,2020-12-28,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) primarily infects neonatal piglets causing catastrophic effects on the global pig farming industry. PEDV infects piglets through the nasal cavity, a process in which dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role. However, neonatal piglets have fewer nasal DCs. This study found that subepithelial CD3(+) T cells mediated PEDV invasion through the nasal cavity in neonatal piglets. PEDV could replicate in the nasal epithelial cells (NECs) isolated from the nasal cavity of neonatal piglets. Infection of NECs with PEDV could induce antiviral and inflammatory cytokines at the late stage. The infected NECs mediated transfer of virus to CD3(+) T cells distributed in the subepithelial of the nasal cavity via cell-to-cell contact. The infected CD3(+) T cells could migrate to the intestine via blood circulation, causing intestinal infection in neonatal piglets. Thus, the findings of this study indicate the importance of CD3(+)T cells in the dissemination of PEDV from the nasal cavity to the intestinal mucosa in neonatal piglets.","Yuan, Chen; Jin, Yuxin; Li, Yuchen; Zhang, En; Zhang, Penghao; Yang, Qian",Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7888150/,251

18041,"Editorial: Grief Disorders: Clinical, Cultural, and Epidemiological Aspects",2021-05-20,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is a common pathogen in human sepsis. The emergence of multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae strains represents a major clinical challenge in nosocomial and community acquired infections. The long pentraxin PTX3, a key component of humoral innate immunity, is involved in resistance to selected pathogens by promoting opsonophagocytosis. We investigated the relevance of PTX3 in innate immunity against K. pneumoniae infections using Ptx3 (-/-) mice and mouse models of severe K. pneumoniae infections. Local and systemic PTX3 expression was induced following K. pneumoniae pulmonary infection, in association with the up-regulation of TNF-α and IL-1β. PTX3 deficiency in mice was associated with higher bacterial burden and mortality, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as IL-10 in the lung and systemically. The analysis of the mechanisms responsible of PTX3-dependent control of K. pneumoniae infection revealed that PTX3 did not interact with K. pneumoniae, or promote opsonophagocytosis. The comparison of susceptibility of wild-type, Ptx3(-/-), C3(-/-) and Ptx3(-/-)/C3(-/-) mice to the infection showed that PTX3 acted in a complement-independent manner. Lung histopathological analysis showed more severe lesions in Ptx3 (-/-) mice with fibrinosuppurative, necrotizing and haemorrhagic bronchopneumonia, associated with increased fibrin deposition in the lung and circulating fibrinogen consumption. These findings indicate that PTX3 contributes to the control of K. pneumoniae infection by modulating inflammatory responses and tissue damage. Thus, this study emphasizes the relevance of the role of PTX3 as regulator of inflammation and orchestrator of tissue repair in innate responses to infections.","Asgari, Fatemeh; Supino, Domenico; Parente, Raffaella; Polentarutti, Nadia; Stravalaci, Matteo; Porte, Remi; Pasqualini, Fabio; Barbagallo, Marialuisa; Perucchini, Chiara; Recordati, Camilla; Magrini, Elena; Mariancini, Andrea; Riva, Federica; Giordano, Alessia; Davoudian, Sadaf; Roger, Thierry; Veer, Cornelis van’t; Jaillon, Sebastien; Mantovani, Alberto; Doni, Andrea; Garlanda, Cecilia",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8173212/,251
18374,A platelet-mimicking theranostic platform for cancer interstitial brachytherapy,2021-06-04,"BACKGROUND: Despite current efforts to improve hand hygiene in health care facilities, compliance among birth attendants remains low. Current improvement strategies are inadequate, largely focusing on a limited set of known behavioural determinants or addressing hand hygiene as part of a generalized set of hygiene behaviours. To inform the design of a facility –based hand hygiene behaviour change intervention in Kampong Chhnang, Cambodia, a theory-driven formative research study was conducted to investigate the context specific behaviours and determinants of handwashing during labour and delivery among birth attendants. METHODS: This formative mixed-methods research followed a sequential explanatory design and was conducted across eight healthcare facilities. The hand hygiene practices of all birth attendants present during the labour and delivery of 45 women were directly observed and compliance with hand hygiene protocols assessed in analysis. Semi-structured, interactive interviews were subsequently conducted with 20 key healthcare workers to explore the corresponding cognitive, emotional, and environmental drivers of hand hygiene behaviours. RESULTS: Birth attendants’ compliance with hand hygiene protocol was 18% prior to performing labour, delivery and newborn aftercare procedures. Hand hygiene compliance did not differ by facility type or attendants’ qualification, but differed by shift with adequate hand hygiene less likely to be observed during the night shift (p = 0.03). The midwives’ hand hygiene practices were influenced by cognitive, psychological, environmental and contextual factors including habits, gloving norms, time, workload, inadequate knowledge and infection risk perception. CONCLUSION: The resulting insights from formative research suggest a multi-component improvement intervention that addresses the different key behaviour determinants to be designed for the labour and delivery room. A combination of disruption of the physical environment via nudges and cues, participatory education to the midwives and the promotion of new norms using social influence and affiliation may increase the birth attendants’ hand hygiene compliance in our study settings.

18830,Evidence-Based Assessment of Genes in Dilated Cardiomyopathy,2021-05-05,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The UK low‐risk drinking guidelines (LRDG) recommend not regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol per week. We tested the effect of different pictorial representations of alcohol content, some with a health warning, on knowledge of the LRDG and understanding of how many drinks it equates to. DESIGN: Parallel randomized controlled trial. SETTING: On‐line, 25 January–1 February 2019. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n = 7516) were English, aged over 18 years and drink alcohol. INTERVENTIONS: The control group saw existing industry‐standard labels; six intervention groups saw designs based on: food labels (serving or serving and container), pictographs (servings or containers), pie charts (servings) or risk gradients. A total of 500 participants (~70 per condition) saw a health warning under the design. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes: (i) knowledge: proportion who answered that the LRDG is 14 units; and (ii) understanding: how many servings/containers of beverages one can drink before reaching 14 units (10 questions, average distance from correct answer). FINDINGS: In the control group, 21.5% knew the LRDG; proportions were higher in intervention groups (all P < 0.001). The three best‐performing designs had the LRDG in a separate statement, beneath the pictograph container: 51.1% [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.08–4.54], pictograph serving 48.8% (aOR = 4.11, 95% CI = 3.39–4.99) and pie‐chart serving, 47.5% (aOR = 3.57, 95% CI = 2.93–4.34). Participants underestimated how many servings they could drink: control mean = −4.64, standard deviation (SD) = 3.43; intervention groups were more accurate (all P < 0.001), best performing was pictograph serving (mean = −0.93, SD = 3.43). Participants overestimated how many containers they could drink: control mean = 0.09, SD = 1.02; intervention groups overestimated even more (all P < 0.007), worst‐performing was food label serving (mean = 1.10, SD = 1.27). Participants judged the alcohol content of beers more accurately than wine or spirits. The inclusion of a health warning had no statistically significant effect on any measure. CONCLUSIONS: Labels with enhanced pictorial representations of alcohol content improved knowledge and understanding of the UK's low‐risk drinking guidelines compared with industry‐standard labels; health warnings did not improve knowledge or understanding of low‐risk drinking guidelines. Designs that improved knowledge most had the low‐risk drinking guidelines in a separate statement located beneath the graphics.","Gold, Natalie; Egan, Mark; Londakova, Kristina; Mottershaw, Abigail; Harper, Hugo; Burton, Robyn; Henn, Clive; Smolar, Maria; Walmsley, Matthew; Arambepola, Rohan; Watson, Robin; Bowen, Sarah; Greaves, Felix",Addiction,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8248341/,251
19174,A Study on Mesoporous Silica Loaded With Novel Photosensitizers HCE6 and Oxaliplatin for the Treatment of Cholangiocarcinoma,2021-06-29,"CD71(+) erythroid cells (CECs) are recognized to have an immunoregulatory function via direct cell–cell interaction and soluble mediators. Circulating CECs appear in newborns or patients with hemolytic and cardiopulmonary disorders. To assess the biological role of CECs in systemic inflammation, we studied the gene expression and function in systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of SoJIA patients expressed upregulated erythropoiesis-related genes. It represented the largest expansion of CECs during active phase SoJIA among other inflammatory diseases. Despite the opposing roles of erythropoietin and hepcidin in erythropoiesis, both serum levels were in concert with the amounts of SoJIA-driven CECs. Circulating CECs counts in inflammatory diseases were positively correlated with the levels of C-reactive protein, IL-6, IL-18, or soluble TNF receptors. Co-culture with active SoJIA-driven CECs suppressed secretions of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 from healthy donor monocytes. The top upregulated gene in SoJIA-driven CECs was ARG2 compared with CECs from cord blood controls, although cytokine production from monocytes was suppressed by co-culture, even with an arginase inhibitor. CECs are driven to the periphery during the acute phase of SoJIA at higher levels than other inflammatory diseases. Circulating CECs may control excessive inflammation via the immunoregulatory pathways, partly involving arginase-2.","Kanemasa, Hikaru; Ishimura, Masataka; Eguchi, Katsuhide; Tanaka, Tamami; Nanishi, Etsuro; Shiraishi, Akira; Goto, Motohiro; Motomura, Yoshitomo; Ohga, Shouichi",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8277864/,251

This study explored the epidemiology of cancer, its characteristics, treatment patterns, and risk factors in the southern region of Saudi Arabia. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using cancer patients’ medical records at Asir Central Hospital in the southern region of Saudi Arabia. Active patients’ records were extracted between January 2013 and December 2019. Results: A total of 2038 patients were identified during the study period, with a mean age of 60.9 (SD: 19.0) years. The patients had survived with their cancer for a median duration of 4 years (IQR: 2–6). Around 4.6% of the patients required ICU admission with a median period of 9 days (IQR: 5–14.75). The death rate during the study period was 10.9%. Around 20.8% of the cases were metastatic, of which 77.8% were at stage four of metastasis, and 19.7% of the patients were receiving chemotherapy for their disease. The most common types of cancer were malignant neoplasms of digestive organs, comprising 40.8% of the sample. Older age (60 years and above) and using specific chronic disease medications were predictors associated with a higher risk of death due to cancer (p < 0.05). Smoking history, using specific chronic disease medications, and having previous surgery were predictors associated with a higher risk of ICU admission (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Breast, colon, and liver cancers were the most prevalent in the southern region of Saudi Arabia. Several modifiable cancer risk factors were identified.

Patients were receiving antimicrobial therapy for 376 days in every 1000 days of hospitalization (LOT = 376/1000pd). Overall, the 1st-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones were the most used in respect of the number of prescriptions and the duration of therapy. The calculated global DOT/LOT ratio showed that each patient received an average of 1.5 antimicrobials during the hospital stay. The incidence of antimicrobial resistance, globally, for both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin R), Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii (Carbapenem R), was 1 per 1000 patient-days. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained from the analyses revealed that half of the patients admitted to the hospital who took part in the study were exposed to the use of antimicrobials at some point during their stay. Although moderate, it is noteworthy that there was a decline in the use of antimicrobials throughout the year. The indicators used in this study were found to be very effective for gathering data on the use of antimicrobials, and assessing the results of the initiatives taken as part of the Stewardship program.

20199,Informed Consent in Biomedical Research: Scopes and Challenges,2021-07-14,"BACKGROUND: Clinical natural language processing (cNLP) systems are of crucial importance due to their increasing capability in extracting clinically important information from free text contained in electronic health records (EHRs). The conversion of a nonstructured representation of a patient’s clinical history into a structured format enables medical doctors to generate clinical knowledge at a level that was not possible before. Finally, the interpretation of the insights gained provided by cNLP systems has a great potential in driving decisions about clinical practice. However, carrying out robust evaluations of those cNLP systems is a complex task that is hindered by a lack of standard guidance on how to systematically approach them. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to offer natural language processing (NLP) experts a methodology for the evaluation of cNLP systems to assist them in carrying out this task. By following the proposed phases, the robustness and representativeness of the performance metrics of their own cNLP systems can be assured. METHODS: The proposed evaluation methodology comprised five phases: (1) the definition of the target population, (2) the statistical document collection, (3) the design of the annotation guidelines and annotation project, (4) the external annotations, and (5) the cNLP system performance evaluation. We presented the application of all phases to evaluate the performance of a cNLP system called “EHRead Technology” (developed by Savana, an international medical company), applied in a study on patients with asthma. As part of the evaluation methodology, we introduced the Sample Size Calculator for Evaluations (SLiCE), a software tool that calculates the number of documents needed to achieve a statistically useful and resourceful gold standard. RESULTS: The application of the proposed evaluation methodology on a real use-case study of patients with asthma revealed the benefit of the different phases for cNLP system evaluations. By using SLiCE to adjust the number of documents needed, a meaningful and resourceful gold standard was created. In the presented use-case, using as little as 519 EHRs, it was possible to evaluate the performance of the cNLP system and obtain performance metrics for the primary variable within the expected CIs. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that our evaluation methodology can offer guidance to NLP experts on how to approach the evaluation of their cNLP systems. By following the five phases, NLP experts can assure the robustness of their evaluation and avoid unnecessary investment of human and financial resources. Besides the theoretical guidance, we offer SLiCE as an easy-to-use, open-source Python library.","Canales, Lea; Menke, Sebastian; Marchesseau, Stephanie; D’Agostino, Ariel; del Rio-Bermudez, Carlos; Taberna, Miren; Tello, Jorge",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8367121/,251

We constructed this population-based study of the largest city in Kazakhstan, Almaty with the aim to quantitatively assess HRQL and ascertain whether occupation and lifestyle are associated with HRQL in this population. METHODS: In a random sample (N = 1500) of general population in Almaty (median age 49 (interquartile range 28) years, 50% women), we collected data on demographics, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, lifetime occupational history and general HRQL using SF-8 instrument. The association of demographic and occupational predictors with HRQL was tested in multiple regression models. RESULTS: No occupational associations were found for physical component score in the models adjusted for age, sex, income, cigarette and waterpipe smoking, electronic cigarette use, physical activity, alcohol and exposure to secondhand smoke. Ever being a manager (β − 1.63 (95% confidence interval (CI) − 2.92; − 0.34)), a welder (β − 5.11 (95% CI − 8.77; − 1.46)) and a secretary (β − 5.06 (95% CI − 8.56; − 1.56)) for one year or more was associated with poorer mental component score in the models adjusted for age, sex, income, cigarette smoking, physical activity and each other. Age, income and physical activity were independent predictors of both physical and mental components.

The aim of our study was to provide effectiveness and safety data of ocrelizumab treatment in patients with relapsing–remitting (RR-) and progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) and to evaluate clinical and immunological predictors of early treatment response. In this single-center prospective observational study, we investigated effectiveness outcomes (time-to-confirmed disability worsening, time-to-first relapse, time-to-first evidence of MRI activity and time-to-first evidence of disease activity), clinical and immunological predictors of early treatment response, and incidence of adverse events (AEs). One hundred and fifty-three subjects were included (93 RRMS; 84 females). Median follow-up was 1.9 (1.3–2.7). At 2-year follow-up (FU), disability worsening-free survival were 90.5%, 64.7%, and 68.8% for RRMS, primary-progressive MS (PPMS), and secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) patients, respectively. At 2-year FU, 67.1%, 72.7%, and 81.3% of patients with RRMS, PPMS, and SPMS were free of MRI activity, with NEDA-3 percentages of 62.1%, 54.6%, and 55.1%, respectively. Lower baseline EDSS was independently associated with a reduced risk of disability worsening (HR(95%CI) = 1.45(1.05–2.00), p = 0.024) and previous treatment exposure was independently associated with increased probability of radiological activity (HR = 2.53(1.05–6.10), p = 0.039). At 6-month FU, CD8 + cell decrease was less pronounced in patients with inflammatory activity (p = 0.022). Six patients (3.9%) discontinued ocrelizumab due to severe AEs. Our findings suggest that ocrelizumab is an effective treatment in real-world patients with RRMS and PMS, with a manageable safety profile. Better outcomes were observed in treatment-naïve patients and in patients with a low baseline disability level. Depletion of CD8 + cells could underlie early therapeutic effects of ocrelizumab.

Nrf2 activation is protective in models of human disease and has benefits in clinical trials. Consequently, the Keap1/Nrf2 protein complex is a drug target. However, in cancer Nrf2 plays a dual role, raising concerns that Nrf2 activators may promote growth of early neoplasms. To address this concern, we examined the role of Nrf2 in development of colorectal adenomas by employing genetic, pharmacological, and metabolomic approaches. We found that colorectal adenomas that form in Gstp(−/−): Apc(Min/+) mice are characterized by altered one-carbon metabolism and that genetic activation, but not disruption of Nrf2, enhances these metabolic alterations. However, this enhancement is modest compared to the magnitude of metabolic differences between tumor and peri-tumoral tissues, suggesting that the metabolic changes conferred by Nrf2 activation may have little contribution to the early stages of carcinogenesis. Indeed, neither genetic (by Keap1 knockdown) nor pharmacological Nrf2 activation, nor its disruption, affected colorectal adenoma formation in this model. We conclude that pharmacological Nrf2 activation is unlikely to impact the early stages of development of colorectal cancer.","Knatko, Elena V.; Castro, Cecilia; Higgins, Maureen; Zhang, Ying; Honda, Tadashi; Henderson, Colin J.; Wolf, C.

Here, we describe development, feasibility, and validity of the Boston Remote Assessment for Neurocognitive Health (BRANCH) against in‐person cognitive testing and amyloid/tau burden. METHODS: BRANCH is web‐based, self‐guided, and assesses memory processes vulnerable in AD. Clinically normal participants (n = 234; aged 50–89) completed BRANCH; a subset underwent in‐person cognitive testing and positron emission tomography imaging. Mean accuracy across BRANCH tests (Categories, Face‐Name‐Occupation, Groceries, Signs) was calculated. RESULTS: BRANCH was feasible to complete on participants’ own devices (primarily smartphones). Technical difficulties and invalid/unusable data were infrequent. BRANCH psychometric properties were sound, including good retest reliability. BRANCH was correlated with in‐person cognitive testing (r = 0.617, P < .001). Lower BRANCH score was associated with greater amyloid (r = –0.205, P = .007) and entorhinal tau (r = –0.178, P = .026). DISCUSSION: BRANCH reliably captures meaningful cognitive information remotely, suggesting promise as a digital cognitive marker sensitive early in the AD trajectory.","Papp, Kathryn V.; Samaroo, Aubryn; Chou, Hsiang‐Chin; Buckley, Rachel; Schneider, Olivia R.; Hsieh, Stephanie; Soberanes, Daniel; Quiroz, Yakeel; Properzi, Michael; Schultz, Aaron; García‐Magariño, Iván; Marshall, Gad A.; Burke, Jane G.; Kumar, Raya; Snyder, Noah; Johnson, Keith; Rentz, Dorene M.; Sperling, Reisa A.; Amariglio, Rebecca E.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481881/,251

OBJECTIVE: To examine person-level factors associated with invitation to and participation in clinical trials. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study analyzed responses from 3689 US adults who participated in the nationally representative Health Information National Trends Survey, collected February through June 2020 via mailed questionnaires. EXPOSURES: Demographic, clinical, and health behavior–related characteristics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: History of invitation to and participation in a clinical trial, primary information sources, trust in information sources, and motives for participation in clinical trials were described. Respondent characteristics are presented as absolute numbers and weighted percentages. Associations between respondent demographic, clinical, and health behavior–related characteristics and clinical trial invitation and participation were estimated using survey-weighted logistic regression models. RESULTS: The median (IQR) age of the 3689 respondents was 48 (33-61) years, and most were non-Hispanic White individuals (2063 [59%]; non-Hispanic Black, 452 [10%]; Hispanic, 521 [14%]), had more than a high school degree (2656 [68%]), were employed (1809 [58%]), and had at least 1 medical condition (2535 [61%]). Overall, 439 respondents (9%) had been invited to participate in any clinical trial. Respondents with increased odds of invitation were non-Hispanic Black compared with non-Hispanic White (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.13-3.02), had greater than a high school education compared with less than high school education (eg, ≥college degree: aOR, 4.84; 95% CI, 1.89-12.39), were single compared with married or living as married (aOR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.04-2.73), and had at least 1 medical condition compared to none (eg, 1 medical condition: aOR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.32-3.82). Respondents residing in rural vs urban areas had 77% decreased odds of invitation to a clinical trial (aOR 0.33; 95% CI 0.17-0.65). Of invited respondents, 199 (47%) participated. Compared with non-Hispanic White respondents, non-Hispanic Black respondents had 72% decreased odds of clinical trial participation (aOR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.09-0.87). Respondents most frequently reported “health care providers” as the first and most trusted source of clinical trial information (first source: 2297 [59%]; most trusted source: 2597 [70%]). The most frequently reported motives for clinical trials participation were “wanting to get better” (2294 [66%]) and the standard of care not being covered by insurance (1448 [41%]).

Ferric maltol is a new oral iron replacement therapy designed to optimize iron absorption while reducing the gastrointestinal adverse events associated with unabsorbed free iron. Ferric maltol has been studied in clinical trials involving almost 750 adults and adolescents with iron-deficiency anemia associated with IBD, CKD, and other underlying conditions, and it has been widely used in clinical practice. It is approved for the treatment of adults with iron deficiency with or without anemia, independent of the underlying condition, and is commercially available in Europe and the United States. We review the published evidence for ferric maltol, which demonstrates consistent and clinically meaningful improvements in hemoglobin and measures of iron availability (ferritin and transferrin saturation) and shows that it is well-tolerated over long-term treatment for up to 64 weeks—an important consideration in patients with chronic underlying conditions such as IBD and CKD. We believe that ferric maltol is an effective, convenient, and well-tolerated treatment option for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia, especially when long-term management of chronic iron deficiency is required.

The reproduction numbers for each time period are also computed from the sets of values of the parameters. We found that random screening is most important as a mean of surveillance. Moreover, local asymptotic stability for the Disease Free Equilibrium can be achieved if (i) random screening is sufficiently effective and (ii) infection by detected HIV-positive individuals is minimal. Our results highlight the importance of education for the known infectious for the purpose of preventing further infection.

These are proved to be better in detection, management, control and eradication of animal sufferings caused by various infectious and non-infectious diseases. These innovations have potential impact that extends beyond the animal health and welfare. The advancements have significantly contributed towards improvement in the economy of the country as well as food security. In the present competitive era of evolution, the organisms have inculcated a number of new strategies for survival and spread. Therefore, science needs to continuously evolve more sensitive, specific and high-throughput tools to overcome pathogen cleverness to escape from host immune surveillance. For visible or remarkable changes, it is necessary to use full potential of these advanced molecular techniques into current animal health standards and practices. Under ‘One Health’ concept, the health of animals and humans has to be taken care simultaneously. At present, these advanced molecular diagnostic methods play a significant role in the detection of new and emerging pathogens of livestock. The acquired information also helps to study the interrelationships of pathogens, their hosts and their surroundings. Additionally new vaccines bridging human and animal health development may be discovered. Latest developments in the field of diagnostics and vaccine design through genomics approach have also laid the foundation to enhance the diagnosis and surveillance and in turn helped in the control of infectious diseases. Latest high-throughput DNA sequencing platforms are currently being used for identification and detailed analysis of both disease pathogen and host genomes. The high-throughput data generated using these platforms need to be analysed adopting the bioinformatics and computational genomics that have taken a very high pace nowadays. In the context of animal health, the data analysis may provide some key opportunities for the development of better diagnostic and therapeutic tools for emerging or re-emerging diseases.

Recognition of the process of mitosis dates back over a century, when Fol, Butschli, and Strasburger identified a network of intracellular points and lines, then called the karyokinetic figure, and today known as the mitotic apparatus. This discovery, dating to 1873, laid the foundation for the discovery of chromosomes and, later, the fundamental biologic processes of mitosis and meiosis [1]. But, while cellular growth and proliferation were understood to be essential to the emergence of multicellular organisms, the corollary — that controlled cell death must be part of this calculus of cellular homeostasis — was not appreciated until quite recently. Although cell death was first described in 1859 by Virchow, it took more than a century to appreciate the importance of programmed cell death as a physiological process that eliminated unwanted cells [2]. The term ‘apoptosis’ was coined in 1972 by Kerr, Wyllie, and Currie to describe a distinct type of cell death characterized by the degradation of cellular constituents into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies [3]. Since then, recognition of the importance of apoptosis in health and disease, and an understanding of its cellular mechanisms, has increased exponentially.","Malam, Z.; Marshall, J.

Since the early 1900s when typhoid fever and cholera were frequently causes of waterborne illness in developed countries, drinking water supplies have been protected and treated to ensure water safety, quality, and quantity. Having access to safe drinking water has always been one of the cornerstones of good public health. Not only safe water is limited to drinking water, but recreational water can also be a source for waterborne illness—both from treated waters such as in swimming pools, whirlpools, or splash pads and from non-treated surface waters such as lakes, rivers, streams and ponds. Recreational waters may cause illness not only from ingestion of pathogens, but also when in contact with eyes, ears, or skin. Some pathogens in water can be acquired by inhalation of aerosols from water that is agitated or sprayed such as in humidifiers, fountains, or misting of produce.

Lung involvement is associated with high morbidity and mortality, so it requires early appropriate treatment. Chest computed tomography (CT) and the analysis of biologic specimens are the first line diagnostic tools in these patients, and sometimes invasive methods are necessary. Interpreting the images requires an analysis of the clinical context, which is often complex. Starting from the knowledge about the differential diagnosis of lung findings that radiologists acquire during training, this article aims to explain the key clinical and radiological aspects that make it possible to orient the diagnosis correctly and to understand the current role of CT in the treatment strategy for this group of patients.","Calvillo Batllés, P.; Carreres Polo, J.; Sanz Caballer, J.; Salavert Lletí, M.; Compte Torrero, L.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153726/,251

COPD exacerbations are an important cause of the significant morbidity and mortality related to COPD. These COPD exacerbations increase with severity of the disease, and frequent exacerbations impact the patient's quality of life and activities of daily living. These exacerbations are also associated with considerable physiological deterioration and increased airway inflammatory changes caused by a variety of factors such as viruses, bacteria, and some common pollutants. Exacerbation of COPD results in an increase in airflow obstruction, which further increases the load on the respiratory muscles and increases the effort in breathing, thereby leading to respiratory failure in severe cases. Treatment approaches include the use of corticosteroids, antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilator therapy in certain cases, and ventilatory support. Increased patient education about detecting and treating exacerbations early in the natural history of COPD can be significantly beneficial. Following an exacerbation, the patient's condition should be constantly reviewed, giving attention to risk factors and compliance with therapy.","Wedzicha, J.A.",Asthma and COPD,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155533/,251

31766,Response to COVID-19 in Breast Imaging,2020-04-01,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important respiratory pathogen among infants and toddlers, with infections prevalent and nearly universal in this age group. Severe infections are more common among premature infants, those with cardiac and pulmonary anomalies, and the immunosupressed. Effective prophylactic monoclonal antibody treatment is available for high-risk infants, but there is no effective vaccine. Mouse challenge models have been used for the study of the human RSV pathogen, but the most severe forms of RSV disease are not replicated by this approach. Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM; family Paramyxoviridae, genus Pneumovirus) is a mouse pathogen of the same family as human respiratory syncytial virus. PVM replicates efficiently in mouse-lung epithelial cells in vivo in response to a minimal virus inoculum, and replication is accompanied by local production of proinflammatory cytokines (MIP-1α, MIP-2, MCP-1, and IFN-γ) and granulocyte recruitment to the lung. PVM infection and the ensuing inflammatory response can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory compromise. Our laboratories have pioneered the use of the PVM model for the study of human clinical disease, which has provided important insights into the role of the inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory virus infection. As part of this work, we have presented several immunomodulatory strategies that clearly reduce morbidity and mortality when administered to PVM infected, symptomatic mice, and thus hold promise as realistic therapeutic strategies for severe RSV infection in human subjects.","Rosenberg, Helene F.; Domachowske, Joseph B.","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176177/,251
32335,Digestive system is a potential route of COVID-19: an analysis of single-cell coexpression pattern of key proteins in viral entry process,2020-04-02,"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved tremendous success in high-dimensional and large-scale space control and sequential decision-making tasks. However, the current model-free DRL methods suffer from low sample efficiency, which is a bottleneck that limits their performance. To alleviate this problem, some researchers used the generative model for modeling the environment. But the generative model may become inaccurate or even collapse if the state has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we introduce a model called Curiosity-driven Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which combines variational autoencoder and curiosity-driven exploration. During the training process, the CVAE model can improve sample efficiency while curiosity-driven exploration can make sufficient exploration in a complex environment. Then, a CVAE-based algorithm is proposed, namely DQN-CVAE, that scales CVAE to higher dimensional environments. Finally, the performance of our algorithm is evaluated through several Atari 2600 games, and the experimental results show that the DQN-CVAE achieves better performance in terms of average reward per episode on these games.","Han, Gao-Jie; Zhang, Xiao-Fang; Wang, Hao; Mao, Chen-Guang",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206149/,251

A bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network is trained to match binary programs with their sequence of action states. To work out function scopes in a binary, this binary is first fed to a trained CAN to output its sequence of action states which can be further decoded to know the function scopes in the binary.

Accurate demand forecasting of such products is crucial as it plays an important role in driving efficient business operations and achieving a sustainable competitive advantage. Traditional forecasting methods are inappropriate for this type of products due to the highly uncertain and volatile demand and the lack of historical sales data. It is therefore critical to develop different forecasting methods to analyse the demand trend of these products. This paper proposes a new data mining approach based on the incremental k-means clustering algorithm and the RULES-6 rule induction classifier for forecasting the demand of short life cycle products.

36996,Exploring the components of brand equity amid declining ticket sales in Major League Baseball,2020-07-21,"Geo-replicated systems provide a number of desirable properties such as globally low latency, high availability, scalability, and built-in fault tolerance. Unfortunately, programming correct applications on top of such systems has proven to be very challenging, in large part because of the weak consistency guarantees they offer. These complexities are exacerbated when we try to adapt existing highly-performant concurrent libraries developed for shared-memory environments to this setting. The use of these libraries, developed with performance and scalability in mind, is highly desirable. But, identifying a suitable notion of correctness to check their validity under a weakly consistent execution model has not been well-studied, in large part because it is problematic to naïvely transplant criteria such as linearizability that has a useful interpretation in a shared-memory context to a distributed one where the cost of imposing a (logical) global ordering on all actions is prohibitive. In this paper, we tackle these issues by proposing appropriate semantics and specifications for highly-concurrent libraries in a weakly-consistent, replicated setting. We use these specifications to develop a static analysis framework that can automatically detect correctness violations of library implementations parameterized with respect to the different consistency policies provided by the underlying system. We use our framework to analyze the behavior of a number of highly non-trivial library implementations of stacks, queues, and exchangers. Our results provide the first demonstration that automated correctness checking of concurrent libraries in a weakly geo-replicated setting is both feasible and practical.","Nagar, Kartik; Mukherjee, Prasita; Jagannathan, Suresh",Computer Aided Verification,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363232/,251

The FET based biosensors have gained a lot of attention among all because of its high detection ability, low power, low cost, label-free detection of biomolecules, and CMOS compatible on-chip integration. The sensitivity of the biosensor inversely proportional to device size since they detect low concentration yields quick response time. Although FET based biosensor is having a lot of advantages among others but the short channel effects (SCE’s) and the theoretical limitation on the subthreshold swing (SS > 60mv/dec) of the FET leads to restrict device sensitivity and also have higher power dissipation due to the thermionic emission of electrons. To avoid these problems researchers focus shifts to the new technology FET based biosensors i.e. TFET based biosensors which are having low power and superior characteristics due to Band to band tunneling of carrier and steep subthreshold swing. This manuscript describes the full-fledged detail about the TFET based biosensors right from unfolding the device evaluation to biosensor application which includes qualitative and quantitative parameters analysis study like sensitivity parameters and different factors affecting the sensitivity by comparing different structures and the mechanisms involved. The manuscript also describes a brief review of different sensitivity parameters and improvement techniques.

41413,Acknowledgement to Referees,2020-10-31,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Insulin resistance (IR) is one of the factors that results in metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus and different aspects of cardiovascular diseases. Moringa oleifera seeds (MOS), traditionally used as an antidiabetic food and traditional medicine in tropical Asia and Africa, have exhibited potential effects in improving IR. To systematically explore the pharmacological mechanism of the anti-IR effects of MOS, we adopted a network pharmacology approach at the molecular level. METHODS: By incorporating compound screening and target prediction, a feasible compound-target-pathway network pharmacology model was established to systematically predict the potential active components and mechanisms of the anti-IR effects of MOS. Biological methods were then used to verify the results of the network pharmacology analysis. RESULTS: Our comprehensive systematic approach successfully identified 32 bioactive compounds in MOS and 44 potential targets of these compounds related to IR, as well as 37 potential pathways related to IR. Moreover, the network pharmacology analysis revealed that glycosidic isothiocyanates and glycosidic benzylamines were the major active components that improved IR by acting on key targets, such as SRC, PTPN1, and CASP3, which were involved in inflammatory responses and insulin-related pathways. Further biological research demonstrated that the anti-IR effects of MOS were mediated by increasing glucose uptake and modulating the expression of SRC and PTPN1. CONCLUSION: Our study successfully predicts the active ingredients and potential targets of MOS for improving IR and helps to illustrate mechanism of action at a systemic level. This study not only provides new insights into the chemical basis and pharmacology of MOS but also demonstrates a feasible method for discovering potential drugs from traditional medicines.","Huang, Qiong; Liu, Rong; Liu, Jing; Huang, Qi; Liu, Shao; Jiang, Yueping",Drug Des Devel Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7539042/,251
41741,Arrayed CRISPRi and quantitative imaging describe the morphotypic landscape of essential mycobacterial genes,2020-11-06,"The morphological switch between yeast and hyphae of Candida albicans is essential for its interaction with the host defense system. However, the lack of understanding of host–pathogen interactions during C. albicans infection greatly hampers the development of effective immunotherapies. Here, we found that priming with the C. albicans FLO8-deficient (flo8) mutant, locked in yeast form, protected mice from subsequent lethal C. albicans infection. Deficiency of Dectin-2, a fungus-derived α-mannan recognition receptor, completely blocked flo8 mutant-induced protection. Mechanistically, the flo8 mutant-induced Dectin-2/CARD9-mediated IL-10 production in DCs and macrophages to block thymus atrophy by inhibiting the C. albicans-induced apoptosis of thymic T cells, which facilitated the continuous output of naive T cells from the thymus to the spleen. Continuous recruitment of naive T cells to the spleen enhanced Th1-biased antifungal immune responses. Consequently, depletion of CD4+ T cells or blockade of IL-10 receptor function using specific antibodies in mice completely blocked the protective effects of flo8 mutant priming against C. albicans infection. Moreover, mannans exposed on the surface of the flo8 mutant were responsible for eliciting protective immunity by inhibiting the C. albicans-induced apoptosis of thymic T cells to sustain the number of naive T cells in the spleen. Importantly, priming with the flo8 mutant extensively protected mice from polymicrobial infection caused by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) by enhancing Th1-biased immune responses. Together, our findings imply that targeting FLO8 in C. albicans elicits protective immune responses against polymicrobial infections and that mannans extracted from the flo8 mutant are potential immunotherapeutic candidate(s) for controlling infectious diseases.","Lv, Quan-Zhen; Li, De-Dong; Han, Hua; Yang, Yi-Heng; Duan, Jie-Lin; Ma, Hui-Hui; Yu, Yao; Chen, Jiang-Ye; Jiang, Yuan-Ying; Jia, Xin-Ming",Cell Mol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7642578/,251

These mandates were enforced within most states in the US. Gerofit, a facility-based exercise program for older Veterans in Durham, NC, transitioned to remote virtual exercise instruction to accommodate continuity of care. Objectives: To explore whether remote virtual exercise (RVE) can sustain physical function within individuals previously participating in onsite face to face exercise (OFF). Methods: Physical function assessments performed during OFF were compared with assessments conducted remotely over virtual platform. Assessments included the 30-second arm curl, the 30-second chair stand, time to complete five chair stands, and either 6-minute walk or 2-minute step test. All assessments for RVE were completed via a remote virtual platform. Only participants enrolled in both OFF and home based RVE with functional assessments within 6-months of pre and post COVID-19 transition were compared. Descriptive comparisons, opposed to statistical, were reported due to the limited sample size. Results: Fourteen OFF Gerofit participants were reassessed remotely within the first 6-months of transitioning to RVE (12 male, 2 female, mean age 73.1, mean body mass index 31.5). Functional assessments between OFF versus RVE were arm curls (21.0 vs 20.4 repetitions), chair stands (15.0 vs 17.5 repetitions), and time to 5 chair stands (9.0 vs 8.4 seconds). Cardiovascular function, reported in normalized percentiles (46.4%tile vs 58.9%tile) Conclusion: Among older Veterans engaged in regular structured exercise, physical function was preserved with transition to virtual exercise.","Jennings, Stephen; Manning, Kenneth; Pearson, Megan; Mateas, Catalin; Hall, Katherine; Bettger, Janet; Morey, Miriam",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7740372/,251

45133,Light at the End of the Tunnel,2021-01-28,"Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks support a wide variety of network services including elastic services such as file-sharing and downloading and inelastic services such as real-time multiparty conferencing. Each peer who acquires a service will receive a certain level of satisfaction if the service is provided with a certain amount of resource. The utility function is used to describe the satisfaction of a peer when acquiring a service. In this paper we consider optimal resource allocation for elastic and inelastic services and formulate a utility maximization model which is an intractable and difficult non-convex optimization problem. In order to resolve it, we apply the successive approximation method and approximate the non-convex problem to a serial of equivalent convex optimization problems. Then we develop a gradient-based resource allocation scheme to achieve the optimal solutions of the approximations. After a serial of approximations, the proposed scheme can finally converge to an optimal solution of the primal utility maximization model for resource allocation which satisfies the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions.","Li, Shiyong; Sun, Wei; Liu, Huan",Oper Res Int J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7832444/,251
45940,Second HPRA safety update on COVID-19 vaccines,2021-02-20,"BACKGROUND: Dementia and COVID‐19 share the same key risk factor ‐ age. As the world reacted to the pandemic it became evident that people living with dementia were an exceptionally high‐risk group; disruption to the diagnosis pathway, provision of post diagnostic support, interruptions to research and trials. Alzheimer's Disease International responded quickly to support our global network of 102 associations, many challenged with having to re‐invent their services, including withdrawal of face‐to‐face support & confronting income crises; plus providing timely information, support and advocacy interventions to partners. METHOD: Early 2020 ADI engaged our global associations to gauge the concern around COVID‐19, with insight from our member association in China. Regular contact with the WHO and our international partners gave us impetus to adapt our programme of work. RESULT: ADI produced an online COVID‐19 resource; a go‐to for information, advice, experience and learning. A key resource, an advisory video from Prof. Huali Wang, China, offering health and care advice ‐ subsequently translated into a number of co‐authored articles in The Lancet; followed by a paper on 'Difficult decisions about hospital admission and triage' Through series of global webinars ADI provided up to the minute experience & information focussing on key areas ‐ care homes; the scarcity of resources; life/ deaths decision making and the rights of people with dementia to treatment. Future gazing sessions followed to ascertain the impact of COVID‐19 on the diagnosis pathway, national plans, trials and on prevalence rates. Thorough our engagement with the WHO, ADI contributed to the creation of an inter‐agency mental health and psychosocial support resource and participated in the Civil Society Working Group on NCDs. Media engagement brought vital attention and coverage to dementia, through titles including BBC World & Futures, The Economist, The Telegraph. CONCLUSION: Timely responses, interventions and the provision of COVID‐19 resources has enabled our global associations to adapt their operations to better respond to the crisis and to review operational and policy strategies. Through partnership working, timely sharing of information and advice, we have facilitated a strong reaction and positive response throughout the dementia sector to this extraordinary period.","Lynch, Chris; Weidner, Wendy S",Alzheimers Dement,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883086/,251

Using a survey experiment conducted in May 2020 with almost 5,000 respondents, this paper examines the effect of source cues and message frames on perceptions of information credibility in the context of COVID-19. Each health recommendation was framed by expert or nonexpert sources, was fact- or experience-based, and suggested potential gain or loss to test if either the source cue or framing of issues affected responses to the pandemic. We find no evidence that either source cue or message framing influence people’s responses – instead, respondents’ ideological predispositions, media consumption, and age explain much of the variation in survey responses, suggesting that public health messaging may face challenges from growing ideological cleavages in American politics.","Case, Chandler; Eddy, Christopher; Hemrajani, Rahul; Howell, Christopher; Lyons, Daniel; Sung, Yu-Hsien; Connors, Elizabeth C.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7925984/,251
46820,HIV and Aging: Double Stigma,2021-03-12,"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of pediatric pancreatitis has been increasing over the last 20 years. We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics for pediatric acute pancreatitis (AP) with adult AP, and investigate the risk factor for acute recurrent pancreatitis (ARP) in children. METHOD: From June 2013 to June 2019, a total of 130 pediatric patients with AP at the inpatient database were enrolled. Univariate analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to identify the risk factors for ARP in children. RESULT: Major etiologic factors in 130 patients were biliary (31.5%), idiopathic (28.5%). The etiology of pancreatitis in children was markedly different from that in adults (p < 0.001). Compared with the adult patients, the pediatric patients had significantly lower severity (p = 0.018) and occurrence rate of pancreatic necrosis (p = 0.041), SIRS (p = 0.021), acute peripancreatic fluid collection (p = 0.014). Univariate and Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that female (p = 0.020; OR 3.821; 95% CI 1.231–11.861), hypertriglyceridemia (p = 0.045; OR 3.111; 95% CI 1.024–9.447), pancreatic necrosis (p = 0.023; OR 5.768; 95% CI 1.278–26.034) were the independent risk factors of ARP. Hypertriglyceridemia AP had the highest risk of recurrence compared to other etiology (p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Biliary and idiopathic disease were the major etiologies of AP in children. Children have simpler conditions than adults. Female, hypertriglyceridemia, and pancreatic necrosis were associated with the onset of ARP.","Zhong, Rui; Tan, Shali; Peng, Yan; Xu, Huan; Jiang, Xin; Yan, Yongfeng; Lv, Muhan; Liu, Li; Tang, Xiaowei",BMC Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7941124/,251

However, not much has been discovered on how the blended model affects learning outcomes in higher education, of medical staff in particular. Therefore, the main objective of this pilot study is to analyze and consider students’ perception of blended model compared to the face-to-face course delivery, and their learning outcomes achievement. The research was conducted at the Tertiary school for medical staff in Olomouc, Czech Republic, within the ESP course. Totally, the research sample included 86 first year students of various medical study programmes. Both forms of instruction, face-to-face and blended model, were implemented for 16 weeks, i.e. one semester. Data were collected via two written didactic tests. Students’ feedback on the blended learning mode was monitored by the questionnaire. They expressed higher motivation and appreciated traditional strengths, i.e. the possibility of individual pace and independence of study. They also demonstrated better learning outcomes in the test scores, despite no significant differences were discovered. However, the students with lower level of English performed slightly better in the group taught in the blended mode.","Faltynkova, Ludmila; Simonova, Ivana; Kostolanyova, Katerina; Barot, Tomas",Educating Engineers for Future Industrial Revolutions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972137/,251

The chapter sets the scene by an account of how previous periods of technological transformation affected European societies and considers the financial and regulatory resources at the disposal of the EU to manage the technological shift of the 2020s. The chapter introduces the book’s interdisciplinary approach, which offers various disciplinary perspectives on how the technological mega-shift impacts the EU’s ability to meet the multifaceted challenges it is facing. The chapter concludes that decision-makers at the national as well as European levels must be prepared to take a holistic perspective when addressing technological trends and seeking solutions to the problems that arise in the wake of changing economic and political conditions in society.","Bakardjieva Engelbrekt, Antonina; Leijon, Karin; Michalski, Anna; Oxelheim, Lars",The European Union and the Technology Shift,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978693/,251

The conventional laboratory methods such as NMR and X-ray crystallography which are standard approaches for analysis of different proteins of interest are labor-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming. To address these challenges, the bioinformatics tools and approaches may open up new avenues for investigating the protein structures and functions. In the recent past, molecular modeling has been successfully used in various projects for 3D structure prediction of some therapeutically important proteins having applications ranging from medicine to agriculture. The approach of molecular modeling is based on the understanding of algorithms of protein structure prediction.

Very limited data are available regarding the utilization of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) in patients with severe post-cardiotomy acute respiratory distress syndrome (PC-ARDS). METHODS: A retrospective review of consecutive patients with PC-ARDS managed with VV-ECMO from 2014-2020 at a single institution was performed. Data were collected from the institutional ELSO registry and supplemented with chart review. Survival to key time-points was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 22 patients (mean age 60±15 years, 73% male) with PC-ARDS were managed with VV-ECMO during the study period. Their mean Respiratory ECMO Survival Prediction (RESP) score was -5.9±3.5. ECMO support was initiated in 11/22 (50%) patients within 24h of the index operation, and between 2-23 days postoperatively (median 4 days) in the remaining patients. VV-ECMO was the initial cannulation strategy in 16/22 (73%) cases. In the remaining 6/22 (27%) cases, VA-ECMO was initiated and then transitioned to VV-ECMO after median 3 days (range 0.5-13 days). Survival to decannulation and to discharge occurred in 15/22 (68%) and 8/21 (38%) patients, respectively. One patient is still admitted to the hospital and has been decannulated from VV-ECMO. After median follow-up 545 days (range 11-1306 days) among survivors to hospital discharge, 60-day and 1-year survival were 86% and 67%, respectively. Patients surviving to hospital discharge were younger than non-survivors (mean age 50±15 versus 65±13 years, p=0.03), but there was no difference in RESP score among these groups (survivors: -5.8±2.8 versus non-survivors: -6.0±4.8, p=0.90). CONCLUSION: Although post cardiotomy ARDS is associated with a high mortality, VV-ECMO should be considered as a potential rescue strategy, especially in younger patients.","Hafen, L.; Squiers, J.J.; Hamandi, M.; Brinkman, W.; Harrington, K.; Hutcheson, K.; Jett, G.; Moore, D.; Ryan, W.; Schaffer, J.; Smith, R.; DiMaio, J.; George, T.",J Heart Lung Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979394/,251

Recently, its level of support has reached new heights as evidenced by the harsh tone of official Chinese media coverage of those that malign Huawei, the government’s vigorous public defense of Huawei, and its threats and sanctions against countries and companies that make anti-Huawei moves. This chapter shows that China’s helping hand for Huawei has roots in its technology policy generally and telecommunications policy specifically, both of which are driven by powerful international and domestic security, political, economic rationales that are long-standing, albeit fluctuating in importance. Given this, foreign governments and businesses should not expect China to hang up on Huawei absent compelling countervailing forces.","Blanchard, Jean-Marc F.",Huawei Goes Global,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981107/,251

In the picture produced by the literature, there is a rift between liberals and cosmopolitans, who tend to be sympathetic to the idea of international intervention in cases of mass atrocities, and realists and critical scholars, who tend to be highly sceptical of the idea of intervention. My aim in this chapter is to sketch out an alternative picture: This picture weaves together realist, liberal, cosmopolitan and critical insights and brings into a close relationship the concept of international intervention, the interest of powerful political actors and the idea of the moral and political value of human plurality for (international) political life.","Royer, Christof",Evil as a Crime Against Humanity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981398/,251

As the ECB saw international interest spreads as distortions in the transmission of monetary policy, it compensated for liquidity outflows by allowing the respective NCBs to issue and lend out more money. However, out of concern for the concentration of liquidity in only a few countries, above all Germany, the ECB Council ultimately decided to differentiate its marginal policy interest rates. It did so by exempting huge brackets or “tiers” of banks deposits from penalty interest, thus effectively differentiating the marginal deposit rates between the countries. The differentiation immediately implied bank lending from liquidity abundant countries like Germany to the liquidity scarce Mediterranean countries in order to exploit the unexploited bracket space, which reduced the Target balances.","Sinn, Hans-Werner",The Economics of Target Balances,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991142/,251

Bazelon Center and other mental health groups released a statement on Jan. 14 calling on states to include individuals in psychiatric hospitals for priority vaccination. The National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, the American Psychological Association, Mental Health America and the National Alliance on Mental Illness have also joined in this effort. In a Dec. 2, 2020, letter to leaders of the National Governors Association, the National Association for Behavioral Healthcare requested that the nation's governors be encouraged to ensure that mental health and addiction treatment providers are included among the top‐priority sites for the first round of vaccine distribution (see MHW, Dec. 11, 2020). On Dec. 3, 2020, the CDC issued recommendations for allocating initial supplies of the COVID‐19 vaccine, according to the statement. It recommended that the first groups to receive vaccines be health care workers, including hospital staff, and residents of “long‐term care facilities,” including nursing homes and assisted living facilities. According to the statement, the committee's recommendations do not directly address whether psychiatric inpatients are or should be included among those first to receive the vaccine (Phase 1A). However, the committee did make clear that “health care settings in general [such as hospitals], and long‐term care settings in particular, can be high‐risk locations for SARS‐CoV‐2 exposure and transmission.” Many psychiatric inpatients, including most psychiatric inpatients in general hospitals, will be discharged after a relatively short stay. In the allocation of vaccines, inpatient psychiatric patients who are likely to be discharged after a short stay should receive the same priority for vaccination as other hospital patients, according to the statement. Many psychiatric inpatients, however, especially those in state and other public hospitals, will experience stays of weeks and months. In the allocation of vaccines, these patients should have the same priority for vaccination as residents of other longer‐term congregate care facilities, such as nursing homes and as‐sisted living facilities, according to the statement. Accordingly, to implement the CDC's recommendations, state authorities making vaccine‐allocation decisions should include psychiatric inpatients whose hospital stay is likely to be weeks or months in the first group to receive the vaccine (Phase 1a) and give short‐term psychiatric inpatients the same priority as other hospital inpatients and require that hospital discharge plans provide for the administration of a second dose of the vaccine.",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8014086/,251

Mining is one of the core sectors and growth driver of Indian economy. Minerals and ores provide basic raw materials to many important industries like power generation (thermal), iron and steel, cement, petroleum and natural gas, petrochemicals, fertilizers, precious and semi-precious metals/stones for jewellery, electrical and electronics equipment, glass, ceramics, etc. The mining sector in India was poised for robust growth in financial year 2020–2021, on the back of rising demand from end-use sectors and fresh investments announced by the mining companies. However, the spread of COVID-19, right at the beginning of the financial year, has led to disruptions across industries. There is a significant scope for new mining capacities in iron ore, bauxite, coal and other minerals and considerable opportunities for future discoveries of sub-surface deposits. Infrastructure projects continue to provide lucrative business opportunities for steel, zinc and aluminium producers. Iron and steel make up a core component for the real estate sector. Demand for these metals is set to continue given strong growth expectations for the residential and commercial building industry. India’s mining sector expected to show positive growth in 2021 compared to 2020. As different arms of the government work with stakeholders to bring the economy on the growth path, it is important for the policymakers of mining to continue making such changes to the policies, which can ramp up the contribution of the sector to GDP. In the present paper, an overview of impact of lockdown on the mining industry in India is discussed with special reference to production scenario of minerals, employment, export-import scenario of ores and minerals and other developments during the period.

52576,New EMA/ECDC initiative for monitoring COVID-19 vaccines,2021-05-08,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter human cells. This receptor is avidly expressed in the pancreatic islets, suggesting the virus may target β-cell function. 17% of adults with COVID-19 have evidence of pancreatic injury. There is a direct relation between insulin resistance and COVID-19 severity and mortality with patients with higher insulin resistance presenting with higher inflammatory response. Fulminant type 1 diabetes (fT1D) has abrupt onset of symptoms with insulinopenia without evidence of autoimmunity, usually preceded by viral illness. Clinical case: A 12-year-old Hispanic male presented with a week history of polyuria, polydipsia, headache, and fatigue but no weight loss, fever, cough, anosmia, or diarrhea. Laboratory testing revealed new onset diabetes with DKA with HbA1C 11.3%, blood pH 7.04, glucose 381 mg/dL, C-peptide 0.6 ng/mL, β-hydroxybutyrate 8.2 mmol/L, and a positive nasopharyngeal PCR for SARS-CoV-2 but no elevation of inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR and ferritin). There was evidence of mild pancreatic injury (lipase 179 U/L, n:15-110 U/L), and all autoantibodies for autoimmune diabetes were negative. He was pubertal (Tanner 3), non-obese (BMI Z score -0.3) and without acanthosis nigricans. Past medical and family history were non-contributory. He was treated with IV insulin at 0.1 u/kg/h until DKA resolved within 24 h then transitioned to subcutaneous insulin at 1 u/kg/day. He did not have signs of systemic inflammatory response, need for respiratory support, or glucocorticoids but had persistent hyperglycemia prompting an increase of insulin dosing and resumption of IV insulin. His insulin requirements continued to increase up to 4 u/kg/d with sustained hyperglycemia indicative of an exceptional state of insulin resistance. On Day 6 of admission metformin was initiated, on Day 9 insulin requirements declined and he was discharged on an insulin regimen close to 1.5 u/kg/d. Eventually metformin was discontinued on Day 20 after diagnosis without rebound in insulin requirements. On Day 28 he had improved glycemic control (HbA1c 8.8%) at insulin doses more appropriate for his age and pubertal status (0.9 u/kg/d). Clinical lessons: We report a case of autoantibody negative diabetes with pancreatic injury and marked insulin resistance unrelated to systemic inflammatory response associated with COVID-19. The clinical presentation was reminiscent of fT1D with the exception of exceptional insulin resistance. This is perhaps a novel form of diabetes mellitus not otherwise classified. Although the pathophysiology remains obscure, it is plausible that it is mediated by direct islet injury. Notably, there was a discordance between the severity of illness and insulin resistance suggesting an intrinsic effect of SARS-CoV-2 on glucose hemostasis.","Martinez, Alfonso Hoyos; Hicks, Kelly Anne; Moorjani, Tracy Patel; Bell, Jennifer; Lin, Yuezhen",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090493/,251

How to research on a crucial feature of human development—the self-reflexive intentional relating with the anticipated future? This article is an attempt to develop the epistemology of becoming on an empirical level, by analyzing my self-writings from the period I became a mother. I show that becoming a mother is a developmental process that happens through time and through the performing of daily activities such as nursing, bathing the baby and so on.

India depends on national surveys and individual studies for public health information. At present All India Institute of Medical Sciences – New Delhi HDSS and Vadu HDSS are well established HDSS in India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a HDSS in a remote rural area of South India and named as Community Health Information Management System (CHIMS) This covered 20 villages around Rural Health Training Centre – Chunampet. We collected the family and demographic information from March 2018 to October 2018. Pregnancy, birth, under-five and mortality data were collected once in every 3 months with the help of interns, Medical Social Workers. Data collection done using CHIMS Guide and entered in EpiData software. EpiAnalysis, Quantum Geographic Information System, Dropbox were the other freely available software used in this program. RESULTS: CHIMS HDSS covered 14924 individuals belonging to 4486 households in the surrounding twenty villages. Population density was 213/km(2). CHIMS consumed very limited resources in terms of workforce, materials, and transport. CHIMS database was used as a baseline database for many other studies. This CHIMS HDSS helped in many publications, postgraduate thesis dissertations and mainly attracted many extramural research funds from leading government Research Institutes from India. CONCLUSION: CHIMS proved to be a robust surveillance system in providing vital public health information about the community and attracted more extramural funds to the institute.","Newtonraj, Ariarathinam; Purty, Anil Jacob; Vincent, Antony; Manikandan, Mani; Bazroy, Joy; Konduru, Rajesh Kumar; Natesan, Murugan",J Educ Health Promot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8249961/,251

This principally offers the opportunity for drug interventions over a prolonged period. The prerequisite is that clear therapeutic targets can be identified. One of the most important targets is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), the activation of which is a key contributor to the progression and deterioration of renal function.

Interpretive structural modeling with polarity (TISM-P) approach is opted for exploring the interrelationships among productivity drivers of the airline industry by considering the experts’ inputs. The study identified 17 factors driving the productivity of the airline industry, and experts’ inputs had placed them in nine levels using a TISM-P approach. Fuzzy-MICMAC (Matrice d’impacts croisés multiplication appliquée á un classment) analysis further has classified these 17 factors into the following four groups: autonomous, dependent, linkage, and independent group. Also, it is observed that refining productivity issues have increased the airline industry’s export performance. The airlines’ administration can plan the short-term objectives by considering the independent factors and long-term policies by focussing on the linkage and dependent factors for improving the overall productivity and export performance.

59436,Precision Dosing: The Clinical Pharmacology of Goldilocks.,2021-01-01,"A sedentary lifestyle in nursing home residents is often accompanied with reduced life space mobility and in turn affects satisfaction with life. One of the reasons for this may be limited ability to find one’s way around the care facility and its environment. However, spatial orientation exercises might reduce these problems if they are integrated into an adequate cognitive-motor training. Therefore, we integrated six novel and target group-specific spatial orientation exercises into an established multicomponent cognitive-motor group training for nursing home residents and evaluated its feasibility. Forty nursing home residents (mean age: 87.3 ± 7 years) participated in the spatial orientation cognitive motor training (45–60 min, twice a week over a period of 12 weeks). The main outcomes included the feasibility criteria (adherence, completion time, acceptance, instructions, motor performance, materials/set up, complexity) and first measurements of mobility and satisfaction with life (SPPB [Short Physical Performance Battery], SWLS [Satisfaction with Life Scale]). Adherence increased over time. The increase was associated with the adaptions and modifications of the spatial orientation exercises that were made to meet the participants’ requirements. A positive trend was discerned for mobility and life satisfaction, comparing pre- and posttraining data. In summary, the feasibility analysis revealed that future interventions should consider that (a) instructions of demanding spatial tasks should be accompanied by an example task, (b) trainers should be encouraged to adjust task complexity and materials on an individual basis, (c) acceptance of the training should be promoted among nursing staff, and (d) surroundings with as little disturbance as possible should be selected for training.","Fricke, Madeleine; Kruse, Adele; Schwenk, Michael; Jansen, Carl-Philipp; Muehlbauer, Thomas; Gramann, Klaus; Wollesen, Bettina",Ger J Exerc Sport Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8515784/,251

METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent SILS between May, 2009 and May, 2015 at Osaka Police Hospital. RESULTS We analyzed 2172 patients. The operations performed consisted of cholecystectomy (n = 598), appendectomy (n = 202), inguinal hernia repair (n = 301), colorectal surgery (n = 673), and gastrectomy (n = 398). SILS was performed safely for a wide range of procedures with acceptable conversion and perioperative complication rates. The resident doctors in our department operated safely on 77 % (156/202) of patients undergoing SILS-LA. The staff surgeons operated on more elderly patients and patients with complicated appendicitis than did the resident doctors. The operative outcomes of the resident-performed SILS-LAs were better than those of the staff surgeons, although there was a patient selection bias. CONCLUSIONS SILS seems safe and feasible for a wide range of procedures. Based on our findings, we believe that SILS-LA could be a useful teaching procedure for resident doctors to perform on selected patients, under the guidance of an experienced staff surgeon.","Wakasugi, Masaki; Tei, Mitsuyoshi; Omori, Takeshi; Anno, Kana; Mikami, Tsubasa; Tsukada, Ryo; Koh, Masahiro; Gakuhara, Atsushi; Furukawa, Kenta; Suzuki, Yozo; Masuzawa, Toru; Kishi, Kentaro; Tanemura, Masahiro; Akamatsu, Hiroki",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-016-1315-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26922213/,251

DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING Academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS Individuals aged 70 and older undergoing spine surgery (N = 89). MEASUREMENTS Postoperative delirium and delirium severity were assessed using validated methods, including the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), CAM for the Intensive Care Unit, Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98, and chart review. Hospital-based outcomes were obtained from the medical record and hospital charges from data reported to the state. RESULTS Thirty-six participants (40.5%) developed delirium after spine surgery, with 17 (47.2%) having purely hypoactive features. Independent predictors of delirium were lower baseline cognition, higher average baseline pain, more intravenous fluid administered, and baseline antidepressant medication. In adjusted models, the development of delirium was independently associated with higher quintile of length of stay (odds ratio (OR) = 3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.48-9.04, P = .005), higher quintile of hospital charges (OR = 3.49, 95% CI = 1.35-9.00, P = .01), and lower odds of discharge to home (OR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.07-0.69, P = .009). Severity of delirium was associated with higher quintile of hospital charges and lower odds of discharge to home. CONCLUSION Delirium is common after spine surgery in older adults, and baseline pain is an independent risk factor. Delirium is associated with longer stay, higher charges, and lower odds of discharge to home. Thus, prevention of delirium after spine surgery may be an important quality improvement goal.","Brown, Charles H; LaFlam, Andrew; Max, Laura; Wyrobek, Julie; Neufeld, Karin J; Kebaish, Khaled M; Cohen, David B; Walston, Jeremy D; Hogue, Charles W; Riley, Lee H",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.14434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27696373/,251

Thirteen endoscopic sinus surgeries, 4 skull base surgeries, and 1 tracheotomy were performed with powered air-purifying respirators. During these surgeries, surgical team members donned headsets with microphones linked via conference call. Noise measurements and survey responses were obtained and compared to pre-COVID-19 data. Noise was problematic and caused miscommunication as per 93% and 76% of respondents, respectively. Noise in COVID-19 era operating rooms was significantly higher compared to pre-COVID-19 era data (73.8 vs 70.2 decibels, P = .04). Implementation of this headset strategy significantly improved communication. Respondents with headsets were less likely to encounter communication problems (31% vs 93%, P < .001). Intraoperative measures to protect surgical team members during aerosolizing surgeries may impair communication.

There are three HNS systems available in Germany which differ in their technical details of the underlying comparable basic principle. For the unilateral HNS with respiratory sensing, several comparative studies, high-volume register analysis and long-term reports exist. The continuous HNS without respiratory sensing does not require a sleep endoscopy for indication. For the bilateral continuous HNS as the single partially implantable device, a feasibility study exists. For indication, the assessment of positive airway pressure failure by sleep medicine is crucial, and the decision for HNS should be made in discussion of other treatment options for at least moderate OSA. The implantation center holds primarily responsibility among the interdisciplinary sleep team and is primary contact for the patient in problems. This depicts why structural processes are required to secure outcome quality and minimize the complications. The aftercare of HNS patients can be provided interdisciplinary and by different medical institutions, whereat, minimal reporting standards to document outcome and usage are recommended.","Steffen, Armin; Heiser, Clemens; Galetke, Wolfgang; Herkenrath, Simon-Dominik; Maurer, Joachim T; Günther, Eck; Stuck, Boris A; Woehrle, Holger; Löhler, Jan; Randerath, Winfried",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-021-06902-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151387/,251

Surgical resection is not curative and post-operative recurrence (POR) remains a challenge in these patients. The aim of this study was to identify clinical variables that influence the risk of symptomatic anastomotic POR in patients with ileocolonic Crohn's disease. METHODS Retrospective study of Crohn's disease patients who had undergone ileo-colic resection between January 2014 and December 2018 was performed. For each patient, data was extracted to include demographic information, Crohn's disease clinical setting, pre-operative radiological data, operative and histological data, pre- and post-operative medication history and post-operative clinical course including recurrence of disease. Symptomatic anastomotic POR was defined as symptoms of Crohn's disease in the presence of confirmed anastomotic POR (endoscopic and/or radiological POR). RESULTS For the study period, 104 patients were eligible and included for analysis. The cumulative probability of symptomatic anastomotic POR was 14%, 30%, 42%, 50% and 50% at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively. Two clinical variables on multivariate analysis were associated with increased risk of symptomatic anastomotic POR and included, age <17 years at diagnosis (HR 2.17, p=0.019) and gastrointestinal involvement (extent) >30cm (HR 1.85, p=0.048). CONCLUSION This study describes the natural history of POR after ileo-colic resection for Crohn's disease, as defined by endoscopic, radiological, and clinical outcomes. Age <17 years at diagnosis and gastrointestinal involvement (extent) >30cm were independent risk factors for symptomatic anastomotic post-operative recurrence.","Navaratne, Lalin; Hurndall, Katherine-Helen; Richardson, Daniel M; Stephenson, Robert; Power, Niall; Gillott, Holly; Ruiz Sánchez, Susana; Khodatars, Kuresh; Chan, Christopher Lh",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33448576/,251
60861,COVID-19: Small-Molecule Clinical Trials Landscape.,2020,"Aim This study presents the experience of managing patients with COVID-19 after cardiac transplantation (CT).Material and methods Infectious complications (IC) following CT are a leading cause for morbidity and mortality. A prolonged incubation period, atypical IC symptoms, and originally altered results of laboratory and instrumental diagnosis are characteristic of recipients due to immunosuppression. In 2020, the coronavirus infection (COVID-19) rapidly spread worldwide, and timely diagnosis and searching for effective treatments for this disease became a major challenge. From January 2010 through July 2020, 148 patients received orthotopic heart transplants at the V.A. Almazov National Medical Research Center; 34 of these patients died by the present time and were excluded from this analysis. 114 patients were included into the retrospective evaluation of results. These patients had been a part of the group followed up at the Center for more than a month.Results From March through July 2020, 12 (10.5 %) of 114 CT recipients were infected with the virus SARS-CoV-2. In 75 % (n=9) of the sick patients, the COVID-19 infection developed after more than one year after CT. From the first day of clinical symptoms, mycophenolic acid/everolimus were temporarily suspended. The outpatient treatment was started on the first day and included an antiviral therapy (oseltamivir), mucolytics (bromhexine), vitamin C, and anticoagulants. If the disease onset was associated with pyretic fever the empiric antibacterial levofloxacin treatment was administered due to a high risk of mixed infection. Hospitalized patients with moderately severe COVID-19 (n=3) were treated with oxygen inhalation through nasal cannula and prone position with a positive effect.Conclusion Remote counseling of patients after CT and consistency of the outpatient treatment with recommendations of managing transplant physicians provided timely diagnosis of IC, early administration of treatment, and the absence of COVID-19 complications. Reducing the regimen of immunosuppressive therapy (antiproliferative agents) for up to 14 days facilitated infection control and was not associated with acute rejection crisis and/or impairment of the transplant function.","Simonenko, M A; Fedotov, P A; Sazonova, Yu V; Monosova, K I; Sitnikova, M Yu; Nikolaev, G V; Gordeev, M L; Karpenko, M A",Kardiologiia,https://doi.org/10.18087/cardio.2020.12.n1342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33522466/,251

However, the effect of reclaimed water on the virtual water trade has not been evaluated in previous studies. For the sake of sustainable water management, this study explored the benefits of reclaimed water use for balancing the water resource allocation at the interprovincial level. Multiregional input-output analysis and ecological network analysis were used to investigate the spatial and structural characteristics of the virtual reclaimed water network (VRWN) among 31 provinces in China and the potential effect of reclaimed water use. The results show that the net export flows of virtual reclaimed water have different spatial patterns from those of freshwater, some provinces that import virtual freshwater are exporters of virtual reclaimed water. Although the exploitative relationship is the dominant ecological relationship in the VRWN (72%), it is confirmed that reclaimed water use contributes to balancing the virtual water trade of China with a more competitive relationship (21%) than in the virtual freshwater network (4%). The virtual freshwater consumption change rate in developed provinces decreases by more than 10% through reclaimed water use. Due to the high food exports and low application of wastewater reclamation in less developed provinces, the effect of reclaimed water use in those provinces is not as obvious as that in developed provinces. This paper offers a new perspective for understanding the current VRWN and guidance for the optimization of the virtual water trade structure.","Qi, Hang; Zeng, Siyu; Shi, Lei; Dong, Xin",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740749/,251

Clinical visits have only been facilitated for emergency purposes. Fewer patients have been admitted to the hospital for both ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI) and a profound decrease in heart failure services has been reported. A similar reduction in the patient presentation is seen for ischemic heart disease, decompensated heart failure, and endocarditis. Cardiovascular services, including catheterization, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), cardiac investigations such as electrocardiograms (ECGs), exercise tolerance test (ETT), dobutamine stress test, computed tomography (CT) angiography, transesophageal echocardiography (TOE) have been reported to have declined and performed on a priority basis. The long-term implications of this decline have been discussed with major concerns of severe cardiac complications and vulnerabilities in cardiac patients. The pandemic has also had psychological impacts on patients causing them to avoid seeking medical help. This review discusses the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of various cardiology services and aims to provide strategies to restore cardiovascular services including structural changes in the hospital to make up for the reduced staff personnel, the use of personal protective equipment in healthcare workers, and provides alternatives for high-risk cardiac imaging, cardiac interventions, and procedures.

METHODS A k-means clustering method is proposed to group voxels with similar SAR behaviors in the scanned object, providing a controlled upper-bounded estimation of peak local SARs. This k-means compression model and the conventional virtual observation point (VOP) model were tested in a pTx MRI framework. The pTx pulse design with different SAR controlling schemes was simulated using a numerical human head model and an eight-channel 7T coil array. Multiple criteria (including RF power, global and peak local SARs, and excitation accuracy) were compared for the performance testing. RESULTS The k-means compression model generated a narrower overestimation bound, leading to a more accurate local SAR estimation. Among different pTx pulse design approaches, the k-means compression model showed the best trade-off between the SAR and excitation accuracy. CONCLUSIONS The developed SAR compression model is advantageous for pTx framework given the narrower overestimation bound and control over the compression ratio. Results also illustrate that a moderate increase of maximum RF power can be useful for reducing the maximum local SAR deposition.","Mao, Xianglun; Bari, Sumra; Love, David J; Rispoli, Joseph V",Magnetic resonance in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.28456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810320/,251

61433,Functional reorganization during the recovery of contralesional target selection deficits after prefrontal cortex lesions in macaque monkeys.,2019-11-07,"BACKGROUND Unintended pregnancy has dire consequences on the health and socioeconomic wellbeing of adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) (aged 15-24 years). While most studies tend to focus on lack of access to contraceptive information and services, and poverty as the main contributing factor to early-unintended pregnancies, the influence of sexual violence has received limited attention. Understanding the link between sexual violence and unintended pregnancy is critical towards developing a multifaceted intervention to reduce unintended pregnancies among AGYW in South Africa, a country with high teenage pregnancy rate. Thus, we estimated the magnitude of unintended pregnancy among AGYW and also examined the effect of sexual violence on unintended pregnancy. METHODS Our study adopted a cross-sectional design, and data were obtained from AGYW in a South African university between June and November 2018. A final sample of 451 girls aged 17-24 years, selected using stratified sampling, were included in the analysis. We used adjusted and unadjusted logistic regression analysis to examine the effect of sexual violence on unintended pregnancy. RESULTS The analysis shows that 41.9% of all respondents had experienced an unintended pregnancy, and 26.3% of those unintended pregnancies ended in abortions. Unintended pregnancy was higher among survivors of sexual violence (54.4%) compared to those who never experienced sexual abuse (34.3%). In the multivariable analysis, sexual violence was consistently and robustly associated with increased odds of having an unintended pregnancy (AOR:1.70; 95% CI: 1.08-2.68). CONCLUSION Our study found a huge magnitude of unintended pregnancy among AGYW. Sexual violence is an important predictor of unintended pregnancy in this age cohort. Thus, addressing unintended pregnancies among AGYW in South Africa requires interventions that not only increase access to contraceptive information and services but also reduce sexual violence and cater for survivors.","Ajayi, Anthony Idowu; Ezegbe, Henrietta Chinelo",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09488-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894130/,251

The original description of the technique includes 2 parallel incisions that follow the sagittal plane of the septum. We describe a novel modification to the traditional NSF that allows coverage along the posterior wall of the frontal sinus. METHODS In addition to the 2 sagittal incisions, a third incision is made between these coursing along the maxillary crest from the posterior edge to the midportion of the flap. This provides an extension that can be rotated further anteriorly. We report 4 adult patients with skull base defects too large and anterior to cover with a traditional NSF, on whom we successfully reconstructed with the extended flap. We also performed the technique on six cadaver heads (11 flaps) to provide average measurements of the extension. RESULTS Our patients were successfully repaired with maintained flap survival. We were able to achieve an average of 1.9 cm, or 26.8%, of additional length on the cadaveric study. CONCLUSION The relaxing incision described here creates a flap that allows for reconstruction of a larger range of skull base defects.","Bassett, Ethan; Farag, Alexander; Iloreta, Alfred; Farrell, Christopher; Evans, James; Rosen, Marc; Singh, Ameet; Nyquist, Gurston",International forum of allergy & rhinology,https://doi.org/10.1002/alr.21778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27546484/,251

The purpose of this study was to define the overall incidence of REVAS as well as both the sites of reflux and the causes of REVAS through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for EVA. These studies have the advantage of prospectively collected data and a uniform duplex follow-up. METHODS We searched databases (January 1, 2000 through July 1, 2014) for published RCTs evaluating EVA treatment of great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence that employed endovenous laser ablation or radiofrequency ablation. RCTs were eliminated that (1) did not have follow-up of at least 2 years, (2) did not obtain postoperative duplex scans, (3) did not clearly report the incidence of recurrent varicosities after GSV ablation, and (4) treated the small saphenous or anterior accessory saphenous veins. RESULTS Of the 68 studies screened, 20 RCTs that employed EVA of the GSV were identified. Eight had a follow-up of at least 2 years, but one was eliminated because of lack of information on both the site and cause of REVAS. The resultant seven RCTs provided eight comparisons (one study compared both types of EVA to a comparator arm): three used radiofrequency ablation, and five employed endovenous laser ablation. Overall recurrent varicose veins developed in 125 limbs after EVA (22%), with no difference in the incidence vs the L&S group (22%) based on the number of limbs available at the time of the development of recurrence for both groups, but this incidence is dependent on the length of follow-up after the initial treatment. The two studies with serial follow-up showed an approximate doubling of REVAS over time for both EVA and L&S. By contrast, the cause of REVAS was different between the two methods. Neovascularization occurred in only two limbs (2%) after EVA vs 18 (18%) in the L&S group. Recanalization was the most common cause of REVAS for EVA (32%; 40 of 125 limbs), followed by the development of anterior accessory saphenous vein incompetence (19%; 23 of 125 limbs). In contrast to other reports, incompetent calf perforating veins were an infrequent cause of REVAS (7%; eight of 125). CONCLUSIONS There is no difference in the incidence of REVAS for EVA vs L&S, but the causes of REVAS are different with L&S, which has important implications for treatment.","O'Donnell, Thomas F; Balk, Ethan M; Dermody, Meghan; Tangney, Erica; Iafrati, Mark D",Journal of vascular surgery.

64623,Reviving clinical pharmacology: Emma Baker.,2020-11-02,"Despite the prominence of time in influential aging theories and the ubiquity of stress across the life span, research addressing how time perspective (TP) and adversity are associated with well-being across adulthood is rare. Examining the role of TP in coping with life events over the life span would be best accomplished after large-scale population-based exposure to a specific event, with repeated assessments to examine within- and between-person differences over time. A national sample aged 18-91 years (N = 722, M = 49.4 years) was followed for 3 years after the September 11, 2001 (9/11) terrorist attacks. Respondents completed assessments of 9/11-related television (TV) exposure 9-21 days after the attacks, temporal disintegration 2 months post-9/11, and TP, ongoing stress, and well-being at 12, 24, and 36 months post-9/11. Results provided support for measurement invariance of TP across time and across age. Early 9/11-related TV exposure was significantly associated with greater temporal disintegration. Temporal disintegration and ongoing stress, in turn, were associated with between- and within-person variation in past TP. This effect was qualified by an age interaction that indicated a stronger relationship between ongoing stress and past TP for younger compared with older adults. Past and future TP were significantly and independently related to individual differences and within-person variation in psychological well-being, regardless of age. Future work should incorporate adversity as an important correlate of TP across adulthood.

64695,"Spray-dried plasma: A post-traumatic blood ""bridge"" for life-saving resuscitation.",2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND Primary closure of the donor site after flap harvest is key to achieving a satisfactory result. The authors investigated the width of the harvested anterolateral thigh flap allowing primary closure of the donor site. METHODS Sixty-five consecutive patients undergoing reconstructive procedures using anterolateral thigh flaps were divided into two groups: group A, primary closure of the donor site; and group B, donor site covered with split-thickness skin graft. Maximum flap width and thigh circumference were measured at the midpoint of the line connecting the lateral superior margin of the patella and the anterior superior iliac spine. The maximum flap width-to-thigh circumference ratio was calculated. Patients' body mass index and age were recorded. The outcome was evaluated by the surgeon. RESULTS Primary closure of the donor site was possible in 56 patients (86 percent), and in nine patients (14 percent) a split-thickness skin graft was necessary. All of the donor sites were closed primarily when the flap width was less than 16 percent of the thigh circumference. There was a significant correlation between body mass index and the ratio (p<0.001, r=-0.573) and between patient age and the ratio (p=0.033, r=0.267). Muscle herniation was significantly higher in group B (p=0.029). CONCLUSIONS The flap width-to-thigh circumference ratio is a reliable parameter for preoperative planning of primary closure of the anterolateral thigh flap donor site. Primary closure can be achieved if the flap width-to-thigh circumference ratio is less than 16 percent. The patient's body mass index and age have to be taken into consideration.","Boca, Radovan; Kuo, Yur-Ren; Hsieh, Ching-Hua; Huang, Eng-Yen; Jeng, Seng-Feng",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0b013e3181ef8cb7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21042113/,251

Compared with their nonostracized counterparts, ostracized participants were more likely to endorse conspiracy beliefs related to different political issues (Studies 1-3). Moreover, heightened vulnerability mediated the link between ostracism and conspiracy beliefs (Studies 1-3). Offering ostracized participants an opportunity to reaffirm values important to them could reduce their political conspiracy beliefs (Study 4). Taken together, our findings highlight the crucial role of vulnerability in understanding when and why ostracism increases conspiracy beliefs and how to ameliorate this relationship.

Two-day-old and 28-day-old poults were inoculated orally with TCoV-MG10 to examine the effect of age on viral shedding and serum antibody responses to the virus. The presence of coronavirus particles measuring 105.8+/-21.8 nm in the cloacal contents was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy. The pattern of cloacal TCoV shedding was examined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification of the nucleocapsid gene fragment. TCoV serum antibody responses were assessed with two recently developed TCoV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays that used TCoV nucleocapsid and S1 polypeptides as coating antigens. Poults were found equally susceptible to TCoV infection at 2 days of age and at 4 weeks of age, and turkeys of either age shed virus in their faeces starting as early as 1 day post-inoculation and up to 17 days post-inoculation. Poults infected at 2 days of age were immunologically protected against subsequent challenge at 20 days post-inoculation. The protection was associated with measurable serum antibody responses to both the nucleocapsid and S1 structural proteins of TCoV that were detectable as early as 1 week post-infection.","Gomaa, M H; Yoo, D; Ojkic, D; Barta, J R",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079450902751863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19322719/,251
66157,Dysmenorrhea and related disorders.,2017,"Background Liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (LSECtin) is one of the new generation immune checkpoint ligand molecules and plays an important role in the immune environment. Poliovirus receptor (PVR), as another immunosuppression-related molecule, is upregulated in various malignant tumors. However, the clinical value of LSECtin and the correlation of LSECtin with PVR in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain to be elucidated. In this study, a retrospective study was performed to address these issues. Methods This retrospective study included 98 patients with NSCLC. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the expression of LSECtin and PVR in the paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimens. LSECtin was analyzed for associations with the survival rate and overall survival (OS) of the subjects. The mRNA expression of LSECtin and PVR was assessed using the expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Clinical characteristics, prognosis, and the expression of LSECtin and PVR were included in the statistical analysis. Results High positive rates of LSECtin were found in the patients with NSCLC who were nonsmokers, at advanced stages, or had lung adenocarcinoma. Patients with positive LSECtin expression had a significantly lower survival rate (P=0.008) and shorter OS (P=0.017) than those with negative LSECtin. Significant correlation was found between the LSECtin and PVR expression in the patients with NSCLC (P<0.001). Conclusions The increased expression of LSECtin was related to the poor prognosis of patients with NSCLC after tumor resection and has the potential value for predicting the prognosis of these patients. The positive correlation between LSECtin and PVR in NSCLC provides a theoretical basis for the future combination therapy of immune checkpoints.","Zhang, Yizhong; Lai, Huanling; Chen, Peipei; Li, Dan; Khan, Imran; Hsiao, Wen Luan Wendy; Fan, Xingxing; Yao, Xiaojun; Wu, Qibiao; Wang, Meifang; Leung, Elaine Laihan",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-3665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33313138/,251
66533,Monoclonal Antibodies for COVID-19.,2021-02-05,"Excessive fear and worry in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., COVID stress syndrome) is prevalent and associated with various adverse outcomes. Research from the current and past pandemics supports the association between transdiagnostic constructs-anxiety sensitivity (AS), disgust, and intolerance of uncertainty (IU)-and pandemic-related distress. Recent research suggests a moderating effect of disgust on the relationship of AS-physical concerns and COVID-19-related distress, suggesting that transdiagnostic constructs underlie individual differences in activation of the behavioral immune system (BIS). No previous study has examined the independent and conjoint effects of pre-COVID-19 AS-physical concerns, disgust propensity (DP), disgust sensitivity (DS), and IU in this context; thus, we did so using longitudinal survey data (N = 3,062 Canadian and American adults) with simple and moderated moderations controlling for gender, mental health diagnosis, and COVID-19 diagnosis. Greater AS-physical concerns, DP, and DS predicted more severe COVID stress syndrome assessed one month later. Either DP or DS further amplified the effect of AS-physical concerns on COVID stress syndrome, except danger and contamination fears. IU did not interact with AS-physical concerns and DS or DP.

METHOD A systematic review and meta-synthesis were carried out. Five bibliographic databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO and SocINDEX) were systematically searched up to 13th of March 2017, using two sets of search terms: (i) elderly and synonyms and (ii) assistive technology and similar words, and combined with a qualitative research filter. Articles were screened, read and critically assessed. The meta-synthesis was guided by Ricoeur's theory of interpretation. RESULTS Seventeen out of 4645 articles were included. Five phases emerged relating to the process of becoming a user of AT: phase A: Evaluating need, phase B: Acknowledging need, phase C: Incorporating the AT into daily life, phase D: Using the AT, and phase E: Future use. Three transitions, describing factors essential to moving from one phase to the next, were identified; from phase A-B: Valued activities are threatened, from phase B-C: Obtaining the AT and from phase C-D: Trust in the AT. No transition was identified from phase D-E. CONCLUSION The meta-synthesis led to a deeper understanding of the process of older adults becoming users of AT, by exploring findings across the included articles. The identified phases and transitions in the systematic review serve as an analytical framework for understanding the process from the older adult's perspective. This review advocates for using a client-centred approach throughout the entire delivery process. Implications for rehabilitation The process of the older adult becoming a user of AT involves an individualized time factor, and this supports the practice of individualized follow-up. The process of becoming a user of AT is closely related to self-image; healthcare professionals should support not only the use of AT but also the older adult's emotional adjustment to a new self-image. The process is highly influenced by the older adult's social context; healthcare professionals should consider involving the client's social network in the AT delivery process.","Larsen, Stina Meyer; Mortensen, Rikke Falgreen; Kristensen, Hanne Kaae; Hounsgaard, Lise",Disability and rehabilitation.

Paradoxically, FGF21 cardiac and circulating levels correlate with cardiac damage and oxidative stress in patients with ACM, pointing to FGF21 as a potential biomarker of alcohol-induced cardiac damage.

The purpose of this study was to examine the demographics of the orthopedic patients who utilized TM visits during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify opportunities to improve access. Methods: All patients who underwent orthopedic TM visits at one urban academic medical center between January and April 2020 were included. Demographic data including primary zip code, primary language, and visit type were collected. The demographics of the TM cohort were compared with those of patients seen in the outpatient (OP) setting at the same institution the prior year as well as with patients in the metropolitan area (M). Results: Five thousand thirty-five TM visits met the inclusion criteria. The TM cohort was significantly younger than the OP cohort, with mean age of 48.7 ± 19.0 years for TM and 55.2 ± 18.0 years for OP, and with 22% of TM being 65 or older versus 35% of OP being 65 or older (p = 0.001). The TM cohort had a lower percentage of minority patients (41.3%) than the OP cohort (48.2%). The TM cohort had a significantly lower percentage of black 12.9% versus 14.1%, Asian. 5.1% versus 5.8%, and Spanish/Hispanic 1.9% versus 15.4%, than the M and the OP cohort from the prior year (p < 0.026, p < 0.001, p < 0.001). For socioeconomic status, only 13.8% of TM patients were from ZIP codes with median household incomes <50k. A total of 96.2% of TM visits were performed in English, where only 61% of individuals in the metropolitan area report English as their primary language. Conclusions: As the largest analysis of the use of TM in orthopedics, this study highlights both the future potential of TM and areas of improvement to ensure better access to care for all patient populations. Maintenance of the provisions to allow audio-only visits to be considered TM and billed as such is one important measure.","Lott, Ariana; Sacks, Hayley; Hutzler, Lorraine; Campbell, Kirk A; Lajam, Claudette M",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33448896/,251
67530,"Hydroxychloroquine, TTP, COVID-19 and SLE.",2021-01-06,"OBJECTIVE Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective and safe acute treatment for patients not benefiting from antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Few studies have examined its longer term durability. This study assessed the long-term effectiveness of TMS in naturalistic clinical practice settings following acute treatment. METHOD Adult patients with a primary diagnosis of unipolar, nonpsychotic major depressive disorder (DSM-IV clinical criteria), who did not benefit from antidepressant medication, received TMS treatment in 42 clinical practices. Two hundred fifty-seven patients completed a course of acute TMS treatment and consented to follow-up over 52 weeks. Assessments were obtained at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The study was conducted between March 2010 and August 2012. RESULTS Compared with pre-TMS baseline, there was a statistically significant reduction in mean total scores on the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (primary outcome), 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire, and Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Self Report (IDS-SR) at the end of acute treatment (all P < .0001), which was sustained throughout follow-up (all P < .0001). The proportion of patients who achieved remission at the conclusion of acute treatment remained similar at conclusion of the long-term follow-up. Among 120 patients who met IDS-SR response or remission criteria at the end of acute treatment, 75 (62.5%) continued to meet response criteria throughout long-term follow-up. After the first month, when the majority of acute TMS tapering was completed, 93 patients (36.2%) received reintroduction of TMS. In this group, the mean (SD) number of TMS treatment days was 16.2 (21.1). CONCLUSIONS TMS demonstrates a statistically and clinically meaningful durability of acute benefit over 12 months of follow-up.

We argue for inhibition of the TRPV4 calcium-permeable ion channel as a strategy to address this issue, based on the rationale that TRPV4 inhibition is protective in various preclinical models of lung edema, and that TRPV4 hyperactivation potently damages the alveolo-capillary barrier, with lethal outcome. We believe that TRPV4 inhibition has a powerful prospect at protecting this vital barrier in Covid-19 patients, even to rescue a damaged barrier. A clinical trial using a selective TRPV4 inhibitor demonstrated a benign safety profile in healthy volunteers and in patients suffering from cardiogenic lung edema. We argue for expeditious clinical testing of this inhibitor in Covid-19 patients with respiratory malfunction and at risk for lung edema. We note that among the currently pursued therapeutic strategies against Covid-19, none is designed to directly protect the alveolo-capillary barrier. Successful protection of the alveolo-capillary barrier will not only reduce Covid-19 lethality but will pre-empt a catastrophic scenario in healthcare with insufficient capacity to provide ventilator-assisted respiration.","Kuebler, Wolfgang; Jordt, Sven-Eric; Liedtke, Wolfgang",SSRN,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3558887; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32714108/,251

Therefore, a backlog of patients in need of these elective procedures is a probable consequence and increased productivity and efficiency in patient care delivery is essential now and into the future. This article outlines multiple strategies and techniques to develop and optimize efficiency in the hip and knee arthroplasty practice. Techniques for increasing surgical efficiency are detailed, along with perioperative strategies in the hospital, ambulatory surgery center, and office settings are outlined and discussed.","Meneghini, R Michael",The Journal of arthroplasty,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2021.03.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33785228/,251

This outbreak also marked the beginning of large-scale real-time molecular epidemiology. Here, we show how evolutionary analyses of Ebola virus genome sequences provided key insights into virus origins, evolution and spread during the epidemic. We provide basic scientists, epidemiologists, medical practitioners and other outbreak responders with an enhanced understanding of the utility and limitations of pathogen genomic sequencing. This will be crucially important in our attempts to track and control future infectious disease outbreaks.","Holmes, Edward C; Dudas, Gytis; Rambaut, Andrew; Andersen, Kristian G",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/nature19790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27734858/,251
70073,Distal femoral physeal fixation: are smooth pins really safe?,2014,"The heterogeneity associated with glycosylation of the 66 N-glycan sites on the protein trimer making up the spike (S) region of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been assessed by charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS). CDMS allows simultaneous measurement of the mass-to-charge ratio and charge of individual ions, so that mass distributions can be determined for highly heterogeneous proteins such as the heavily glycosylated S protein trimer. The CDMS results are compared to recent glycoproteomics studies of the structure and abundance of glycans at specific sites. Interestingly, average glycan masses determined by ""top-down"" CDMS measurements are 35-47% larger than those obtained from the ""bottom-up"" glycoproteomics studies, suggesting that the glycoproteomic measurements underestimated the abundances of larger, more-complex glycans. Moreover, the distribution of glycan masses determined by CDMS is much broader than the distribution expected from the glycoproteomics studies, assuming that glycan processing on each trimer is not correlated. The breadth of the glycan mass distribution therefore indicates heterogeneity in the extent of glycan processing of the S protein trimers, with some trimers being much more heavily processed than others. This heterogeneity may have evolved as a way of further confounding the host's immune system.","Miller, Lohra M; Barnes, Lauren F; Raab, Shannon A; Draper, Benjamin E; El-Baba, Tarick J; Lutomski, Corinne A; Robinson, Carol V; Clemmer, David E; Jarrold, Martin F",Journal of the American Chemical Society,https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c00353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33657316/,251

The solution is intended for situations where only a narrow optical bandwidth is available in a fiber heavily loaded with standard data traffic. We localized the optical reference signals in the middle of the channel, with signals related to RF reference and time tags shifted ±12.5 GHz apart. In the experimental evaluation with a 260 km-long fiber we demonstrate that the stability of frequency signals and the calibration of time tags remained at the very same level of stability and accuracy as for systems utilizing separate channels: the fractional long-term instability for the optical frequency reference was below 5×10-20, that for the RF reference at the level of 10-17, and the mismatch of the time tag calibration was not more than 10 ps. We also identify possible issues, mainly related to a risk of unwanted Brillouin amplification and scattering.","Krehlik, P; Sliwczynski, L; Buczek, L; Schnatz, H; Kronjager, J","IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",https://doi.org/10.1109/tuffc.2021.3053430; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33476266/,251

CASE DESCRIPTION A 35-year-old, phenotypically syndromic woman presented with signs and symptoms consistent with ischemic stroke. Magnetic resonance imaging and catheter angiography confirmed diagnosis of moyamoya and a 6-mm basilar apex artery aneurysm (BAA). She underwent right-sided craniotomy for direct and indirect revascularization by means of superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass and encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis. Three months later, she underwent stent-assisted coiling of the BAA. At 9 months, the patient remains without her preoperative neurological deficits. Interval catheter angiography confirms revascularization of her right hemisphere and obliteration of her BAA. CONCLUSIONS We present the first case of diagnosis and treatment of moyamoya disease and BAA in a patient with Floating-Harbor syndrome. Due to a paucity of literature on this rare disorder, there has not been an associated link between Floating-Harbor syndrome and cerebrovascular disease. Our report and literature review suggest that these patients may be prone to cerebrovascular disorders and should be followed closely with neurovascular imaging.","Coughlin, Daniel J; Miller, Charles A; Schuette, A Jesse",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2017.05.083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28549641/,251

If true, it behooves the biomedical research community to understand how it avoids taking chances with that trust. This commentary, which builds upon comments of noted trust scholar Russell Hardin about how best to enjoy trust, assumes that the key to being trusted is deserving to be trusted. Thus, it proposes using ""deserved trust"" to identify ways that the public's trust in biomedical research could be better supported. Employing deserved trust to support the public's trust leads us to consider what it is that the biomedical research community should be trusted to do, examine evidence about the effectiveness of current safeguards meant to assure that those things routinely get done, and identify new ways to equip individual researchers, research teams, and research institutions to assure that the public's trust in their research is deserved rather than misplaced.","Yarborough, Mark",Accountability in research,https://doi.org/10.1080/08989621.2020.1855427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33233949/,251
72182,Reducing surgical site infection in arthroplasty of the lower limb: A multi-disciplinary approach.,2013,"OBJECTIVES The variation of luminal pH and transit time in an individual is unknown, yet is necessary to interpret single measurements. This study aimed to assess the intrasubject variability of gut pH and transit time in healthy volunteers using SmartPill devices (Covidien, Minneapolis, MN). METHODS Each subject (n=10) ingested two SmartPill devices separated by 24 h. Mean pH values were calculated for 30 min after gastric emptying (AGE), before the ileocecal (BIC) valve, after the ileocecal (AIC) valve, and before body exit (BBE). Intrasubject variability was determined by comparing mean values from both ingestions for an individual subject using standard deviations, 95% limits of agreement, and Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS Tandem device ingestion occurred without complication. The median (full range) intrasubject standard deviations for pH were 0.02 (0.0002-0.2048) for AGE, 0.06 (0.0002-0.3445) for BIC, 0.14 (0.0018-0.3042) for AIC, and 0.08 (0.0098-0.5202) for BBE. There was a significant change in pH for AIC (mean difference: -0.45±0.31, P=0.0015) observed across all subjects. The mean coefficients of variation for transit time were 12.0±7.4% and 25.8±15.8% for small and large bowels, respectively (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the safety and feasibility of tandem gut transit and pH assessments using the SmartPill device. In healthy individuals and over 24 h, the gut pH profile does not markedly fluctuate in a given region with more variation seen in the colon compared with the small bowel, which has important implications for future physiology and drug delivery studies.","Mikolajczyk, Adam E; Watson, Sydeaka; Surma, Bonnie L; Rubin, David T",Clinical and translational gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1038/ctg.2015.22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26158610/,251
72341,Risk stratification of HPV positive women in routine cervical screening.,2021-03-08,"Traditional food marketing stimulates adolescents' consumption of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods. These dietary behaviours may track into adulthood and lead to weight gain, obesity and related non-communicable diseases. While social media use in adolescents has proliferated, little is known about the content of food marketing within these platforms, and how this impacts adolescents' dietary behaviours. This paper aimed to obtain expert insights on factors involved in the association between social media food marketing (SMFM) and adolescent dietary behaviours, and to explore their views on key priorities, challenges and strategies for future SMFM research and policies. One-on-one semi-structured interviews (n = 17) were conducted with experts from Western Europe, Australia and North America, in the fields of public health (policy), nutrition science, social media marketing, adolescent medicine, clinical psychology, behavioural sciences, communication, food industry, social influencing, and social marketing. The experts' collective responses identified that the line between food content posted by social media users and food companies is blurred. Adolescents' processing of SMFM may be mostly implicit, involving social comparison, emotional engagement, and attaching symbolic meanings to foods. Mediating factors and adolescent-specific and SMFM-specific moderating factors potentially influencing adolescents' response to SMFM were summarized in a Social Ecological model. Experts agreed that there is limited scientific evidence on adolescent-targeted SMFM and there are no strict regulations in place to protect adolescents from unhealthy SMFM, while adolescents are active social media users who are cognitively vulnerable to implicit marketing tactics. Adolescent-targeted SMFM should be controlled by encouraging healthy food marketing or limiting junk food marketing. Also, prioritizing both quantitative research on SMFM exposure and its impact, and qualitative research to obtain adolescents' perspectives, is crucial to advocate for regulatory changes regarding adolescent-targeted SMFM content.","van der Bend, Daphne L M; Jakstas, Tammie; van Kleef, Ellen; Shrewsbury, Vanessa A; Bucher, Tamara",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34509544/,251
72673,Real-world prevalence and consequences of potential drug-drug interactions in the first-wave COVID-19 treatments.,2020-12-23,"INTRODUCTION Hair loss affects most people at some point in their lifetime, causing anxiety and decreased self-esteem. There are multiple surgical and non-surgical treatments available, with the surgical options having greater and longer-lasting effects. Such treatments have evolved over time with advances in technology and research, with numerous patients researching these treatments on Google. Many surgeons who provide these treatments belong to the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgeons (ISHRS). METHODS Patient epidemiological and surgical data from the ISHRS were combined with search trend data from Google to analyze changing trends in surgical hair restoration treatment. RESULTS Worldwide internet searches for ""hair transplant"" have increased from 2004 to the present. Follicular Unit Excision (FUE) has supplanted Follicular Unit Transplant (FUT) as the most popular hair transplant performed. Since 2004, there has been an increase in both non-surgical and surgical female patients. Beard and eyebrow transplants have increased in popularity. Google searches follow this trend. Non-surgical treatments such as platelet rich plasma (PRP) are being searched more frequently. Hair restoration clinics and Google searches were affected adversely by the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION Technological advances in available therapies, improvement in delivery systems, changes in hair fashion, and global events have direct impact on hair restoration treatments offered by physicians and researched by patients. It is in the best interest of all hair restoration providers to keep abreast of changing technologies and treatment trends to stay at the forefront of their profession.","Gupta, Aditya K; Quinlan, Emma M",Journal of cosmetic dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.13723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32945026/,251

This phase I study evaluated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of oral AZD1775 as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy in patients with refractory solid tumors. Patients and Methods In part 1, patients received a single dose of AZD1775 followed by 14 days of observation. In part 2, patients received AZD1775 as a single dose (part 2A) or as five twice per day doses or two once per day doses (part 2B) in combination with one of the following chemotherapy agents: gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2), cisplatin (75 mg/m2), or carboplatin (area under the curve, 5 mg/mL⋅min). Skin biopsies were collected for pharmacodynamic assessments. TP53 status was determined retrospectively in archival tumor tissue. Results Two hundred two patients were enrolled onto the study, including nine patients in part 1, 43 in part 2A (including eight rollover patients from part 1), and 158 in part 2B. AZD1775 monotherapy given as single dose was well tolerated, and the maximum-tolerated dose was not reached. In the combination regimens, the most common adverse events consisted of fatigue, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and hematologic toxicity. The maximum-tolerated doses and biologically effective doses were established for each combination. Target engagement, as a predefined 50% pCDK1 reduction in surrogate tissue, was observed in combination with cisplatin and carboplatin. Of 176 patients evaluable for efficacy, 94 (53%) had stable disease as best response, and 17 (10%) achieved a partial response. The response rate in TP53-mutated patients (n = 19) was 21% compared with 12% in TP53 wild-type patients (n = 33). Conclusion AZD1775 was safe and tolerable as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy at doses associated with target engagement.","Leijen, Suzanne; van Geel, Robin M J M; Pavlick, Anna C; Tibes, Raoul; Rosen, Lee; Razak, Albiruni R Abdul; Lam, Raymond; Demuth, Tim; Rose, Shelonitda; Lee, Mark A; Freshwater, Tomoko; Shumway, Stuart; Liang, Li Wen; Oza, Amit M; Schellens, Jan H M; Shapiro, Geoffrey I",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2016.67.5991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27601554/,251

74002,Neuroscience Next 2020 Abstracts.,2020-12-01,"In this keynote address delivered at the 41st Annual North American Meeting of the Society for Medical Decision Making, I discuss the psychology behind valuing human lives. Research confirms what we experience in our daily lives. We are inconsistent and sometimes incoherent in our valuation of human life. We value individual lives greatly, but these lives lose their value when they become part of a larger crisis. As a result, we do too little to protect human lives in the face of catastrophic threats from violence, natural disasters, and other causes. In medicine, this may pose difficult choices when treating individual patients with expensive therapies that keep hope alive but are not cost-effective for the population, for example, with end of life. Lifesaving judgments and decisions are highly context-dependent, subject to many forms of response mode and framing effects and affective biases. This has implications for risk communication and the concept of shared decision making. Slower, more introspective decision making may reduce some of the biases associated with fast, intuitive decisions. But slow thinking can also introduce serious biases. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of fast and slow thinking is a necessary first step toward valuing lives humanely and improving decisions.","Slovic, Paul",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x20919294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32375586/,251

A rare complication from flow diversion is delayed aneurysm rupture, which can lead to carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) in the setting of cavernous carotid aneurysms (CCAs). Direct CCFs pose unique management challenges, given the lack of transarterial access to the fistula. We present two cases of direct CCFs following treatment of CCAs with the Pipeline embolization device (PED). Case 1 was a middle-aged patient with a symptomatic 10 mm wide-necked left CCA. Six weeks after PED treatment the patient developed diplopia secondary to direct CCF. Case 2 was a middle-aged patient with a symptomatic 17 mm left CCA treated with PED. One-month follow-up angiography demonstrated a direct CCF. Both patients underwent successful coil embolization of the CCF through a transvenous approach. Direct CCF formation following PED deployment for CCA is a rare complication. Parent vessel sacrifice may be avoided with transvenous occlusion of the fistula.","Lin, Li-Mei; Colby, Geoffrey P; Jiang, Bowen; Pero, Guglielmo; Boccardi, Edoardo; Coon, Alexander L",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011235.rep; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25085458/,251

Shear modulus measurement provides an estimate of changes in muscle-tendon stiffness and passive tension. This study aimed to assess the passive individual behavior of each hamstring muscle in different stretching positions using shear wave elastography. METHODS/RESULTS The muscle shear modulus of each hamstring muscle was measured during a standardized slow passive knee extension (PKE, 80% of maximal range of motion) on eighteen healthy male volunteers. Firstly, we assessed the reliability of the measurements. Results were good for semitendinosus (ST, CV: 8.9%-13.4%), semimembranosus (SM, CV: 10.3%-11.2%) and biceps femoris long-head (BF-lh, CV: 8.6%-13.3%), but not for biceps femoris short-head (BF-sh, CV: 20.3%-44.9%). Secondly, we investigated each reliable muscle in three stretch positions: 70°, 90° and 110° of hip flexion. The results showed different values of shear modulus for the same amount of perceived stretch, with the highest measurements in the high-flexed hip situation. Moreover, individual muscles displayed different values, with values increasing or BF-lh, SM and ST, respectively. The inter-subject variability was 35.3% for ST, 27.4% for SM and 30.2% for BF-lh. CONCLUSION This study showed that the hip needs to be high-flexed to efficiently tension the hamstrings, and reports a higher muscle-tendon stress tolerance at 110° of hip angle. In addition muscles have different passive behaviors, and future works will clarify if it can be linked with rate of injury.","Le Sant, Guillaume; Ates, Filiz; Brasseur, Jean-Louis; Nordez, Antoine",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26418862/,251

A 28-year-old woman presented with a symptomatic meningioma. Preoperative tumour embolisation was performed. In the procedure, when selective MMA angiography was done with Omnipaque 300 mg I/mL for 3 mL by manual injection, the patient complained of flashing lights in her eye followed by vomiting and bradycardia down to 40 bpm without increased intracranial pressure signs. On selective MMA angiography, the choroidal crescent and arteries of the periorbital region were opacified by anastomosis from the MMA via the meningo-ophthalmic artery. We diagnosed that her symptoms were caused by selective MMA angiography leading to high pressure stimulation towards the ophthalmic nerve innervation around the orbit as a TCR. We suggest that the operator should be prepared to manage TCR during treatment with expected selective MMA angiography, and gentle low pressure contrast injection should be attempted.","Tamura, Takamitsu; Rex, David E; Marosfoi, Miklos G; Puri, Ajit S; Gounis, Matthew J; Wakhloo, Ajay K",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2016-012517.rep; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27417184/,251

A relatively small number of these lesions demonstrate low signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images. In the majority of cases, a specific diagnosis can be made by interpreting the signal intensity of the lesion with respect to certain pathologic correlates, including blood products, smooth muscle, fibrous tissue, and calcification, as well as high lesion cellularity. For example, lesions that are at least as dark as skeletal muscle are almost always benign, whereas those whose T2 signal intensity is higher than that of skeletal muscle constitute a more heterogeneous group composed of benign, borderline, and malignant disease entities. The authors propose a diagnostic algorithm that takes these features into account, as well as the appearances of the lesion with additional pulse sequences, to aid in the correct interpretation of T2-hypointense adnexal lesions. Knowledge of the anatomy, the T1-weighted imaging features, and the enhancement characteristics of adnexal lesions allows accurate characterization of these lesions, resulting in appropriate patient management.","Khashper, Alla; Addley, Helen C; Abourokbah, Nesreen; Nougaret, Stephanie; Sala, Evis; Reinhold, Caroline","Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.324115180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22786993/,251

Our aim was to determine the impact of these two anastomotic techniques on long-term clinical status in postoperative CD patients. METHODS We performed a comparative effectiveness study of prospectively collected observational data from consented CD patients undergoing their first or second ileocolonic bowel resection and re-anastomosis between 2008 and 2012, in order to assess the association between anastomosis type and 2-year postoperative quality of life (QoL), healthcare utilization, disease clinical or endoscopic recurrence, use of medications, and need for repeat resection. RESULTS One hundred and twenty eight postoperative CD patients (60 STSA and 68 ETEA) were evaluated. At 2 years postoperatively, STSA patients had higher rates of emergency department visits (33.3% vs. 14.7%; P=0.01), hospitalizations (30% vs. 11.8%; P=0.01), and abdominal computed tomography scans (50% vs. 13.2%; P<0.001) with lower QoL (mean short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire 47.9 vs. 53.4; P=0.007). There was no difference among the two groups in the 30 day surgical complications and 2-year patterns of disease activity, CD medication requirement, endoscopic recurrence, and need for new surgical management (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS At 2 years postoperatively, CD patients with ETEA demonstrated better QoL and less healthcare utilization compared with STSA, despite having similar patterns of disease recurrence and CD treatment.

Screening for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in all pregnant women is considered the most effective way of preventing vertical transmission and ophthalmia neonatorum. Objective The aims of this study were to assess prenatal screening rates of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae and to compare sociodemographic factors between those screened and those not screened. Methods The list of all women who delivered at a tertiary care hospital in Montréal, Québec, between April 2015 and March 2016, was cross-referenced with the list of samples tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae. Maternal medical records were reviewed for demographic, prenatal and diagnostic information. Results Of 2,688 mothers, 2,245 women were screened at least once, but only 2,206 women had at least one valid C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae result the day of delivery (82.1%; 95% CI: 80.6%-83.5%). Infection was detected in 46/2,206 (2.1%) screened women: 42 had C. trachomatis infection, two had N. gonorrhoeae infection and two were co-infected. C. trachomatis infection was more frequent in women younger than 25 years (9.8%; 95% CI: 6.7%-13.8%) than in older women (0.8%; 95% CI: 0.4%-1.3%; p<0.001). Each increase in parity decreased the probability of being tested (adjusted odds ratio=0.89; 95% CI: 0.80%-0.97%; p=0.01). Of those with an initial negative test result, 35/267 (13.1%; 95% CI: 9.3%-17.8%) of women younger than 25 years and 122/1,863 (6.6%; 95% CI: 5.5%-7.8%; p<0.001) of women aged 25 years and older were retested. Subsequent infection was detected in 4/35 (11%) women, all younger than 25. Conclusion Suboptimal screening rates for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae suggest that current universal ocular prophylaxis cannot be discontinued. Repeating universal screening should be considered, especially among those younger than 25 years.","Ivensky, Victoria; Mandel, Romain; Boulay, Annie-Claude; Lavallée, Christian; Benoît, Janie; Labbé, Annie-Claude",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,https://doi.org/10.14745/ccdr.v47i04a05; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035667/,251

New clinical practice recommendations are presented to assist practitioners in enhancing the care of all patients with FH. Core recommendations are made on the detection, diagnosis, assessment and management of adults, children and adolescents with FH. Management is under-pinned by the precepts of risk stratification, adherence to healthy lifestyles, treatment of non-cholesterol risk factors and appropriate use of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol-lowering therapies including statins, ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. The recommendations need to be utilised using judicious clinical judgement and shared decision-making with patients and families.

A 12-year-old boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy presented with chest pain, cardiac enzyme elevation, and convex ST elevations in the inferior leads with reciprocal ST depression in the anterior leads on electrocardiogram. Echocardiography on admission revealed normal left ventricular function. Suspecting acute myocardial infarction, we performed invasive coronary angiography, which revealed normal coronary arteries. A follow-up electrocardiogram showed an acute pericarditis pattern with concave ST elevations in most leads and PR depression, and follow-up echocardiography revealed global left ventricular dysfunction, suggestive of acute perimyocarditis. Ibuprofen was administered for acute pericarditis, and a continuous milrinone infusion was commenced for myocardial dysfunction. The chest pain improved by the next day, and the ST segment elevations normalized on day 4. Echocardiography on day 9 revealed improved left ventricular function. The patient was discharged on day 11, and he is doing well without chest pain through 12 months of follow-up. The last electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm without ST change. Differential diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and acute perimyocarditis is important for proper treatment strategies and the different prognoses of these two conditions.","Choi, Ho Jung; Kwon, Hye Won; Oh, Kyung Jin; Song, Mi Kyoung",Acute and critical care,https://doi.org/10.4266/acc.2021.00290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34634842/,251

This study evaluated the rate of WM after video-assisted thyroidectomy (VAT), with emphasis on surgical-site infections (SSIs). METHODS A total of 112 patients were recruited for this prospective, randomized surveillance analysis. The eligibility criteria included nodule smaller than 30 mm, gland volume less than 30 ml, and no previous neck surgery or advanced cancer. The exclusion criteria specified coexistent infection, immunosuppressive treatment, and pathologies requiring antibiotic prophylaxis. The patients were randomized for VAT or CT. Neither antibiotic prophylaxis nor a drain was used. The patients were followed after surgery for WM. RESULTS Both groups consisted of 56 patients. The rate for WM was significantly lower in the VAT group (n = 1) than in the CT group (n = 8) (p < 0.05). The incidence of SSI was 5.3% after CT and 0% after VAT (p < 0.05), and the most common pathogenic organism was Staphylococcus aureus. All WMs became evident after patient discharge. Wound infection was associated with prolonged ambulatory dressings. CONCLUSIONS No previous studies have compared the rates for WM associated with endoscopic versus open surgery in the cervical area. Wound morbidity was significantly reduced after VAT relative to CT. The authors underscore the important effect of the minor surgical trauma associated with VAT on the development of SSIs.","Dionigi, Gianlorenzo; Boni, Luigi; Rovera, Francesca; Rausei, Stefano; Dionigi, Renzo",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1130-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20526624/,251

It comprises of pulmonary opacities sparing the lung peripheries, typically 1cm and less from the pleural surface. This finding has a variety of causes, including idiopathic, inflammatory, infectious, inhalational, cardiac, traumatic, and bleeding disorders. Specific disorders that can cause subpleural sparing patterns include nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), organizing pneumonia (OP), pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), vaping-associated lung injury (VALI), cracked lung, pulmonary edema, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), pulmonary contusion, and more recently, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Knowledge of the many etiologies of this pattern can be useful in preventing diagnostic errors. In addition, although the etiology of subpleural sparing pattern is frequently indistinguishable during an initial radiologic evaluation, the differences in location of opacities in the lungs, as well as the presence of additional radiologic findings, patient history, and clinical presentation, can often be useful to suggest the appropriate diagnosis.

78419,Bottle guard technique for focal and optimal delivery of cryotherapy.,2020-06-18,"INTRODUCTION Paediatric consultations form a significant proportion of all consultations in ambulatory care. Point-of-care tests (POCTs) may offer a potential solution to improve clinical outcomes for children by reducing diagnostic uncertainty in acute illness, and streamlining management of chronic diseases. However, their clinical impact in paediatric ambulatory care is unknown. We aimed to describe the clinical impact of all in-vitro diagnostic POCTs on patient outcomes and healthcare processes in paediatric ambulatory care. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Pubmed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science from inception to 29 January 2020 without language restrictions. We included studies of children presenting to ambulatory care settings (general practice, hospital outpatient clinics, or emergency departments, walk-in centres, registered drug shops delivering healthcare) where in-vitro diagnostic POCTs were compared to usual care. We included all quantitative clinical outcome data across all conditions or infection syndromes reporting on the impact of POCTs on clinical care and healthcare processes. Where feasible, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) by performing meta-analysis using random effects models. RESULTS We included 35 studies. Data relating to at least one outcome were available for 89,439 children of whom 45,283 had a POCT across six conditions or infection syndromes: malaria (n = 14); non-specific acute fever 'illness' (n = 7); sore throat (n = 5); acute respiratory tract infections (n = 5); HIV (n = 3); and diabetes (n = 1). Outcomes centred around decision-making such as prescription of medications or hospital referral. Pooled estimates showed that malarial-POCTs (Plasmodium falciparum) better targeted antimalarial treatment by reducing over-treatment by a third compared to usual care (RR 0.67; 95% CI [0.58 to 0.77], n = 36,949). HIV-POCTs improved initiating earlier antiretroviral therapy compared to usual care (RR, 3.11; 95% CI [1.55 to 6.25], n = 912). Across the other four conditions, there was limited evidence for the benefit of POCTs in paediatric ambulatory care except for acute respiratory tract infections (RTI) in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), where POCT C-Reactive Protein (CRP) may reduce immediate antibiotic prescribing by a third (risk difference, -0.29 [-0.47, -0.11], n = 2,747). This difference was shown in randomised controlled trials in LMICs which included guidance on interpretation of POCT-CRP, specific training or employed a diagnostic algorithm prior to POC testing. CONCLUSION Overall, there is a paucity of evidence for the use of POCTs in paediatric ambulatory care. POCTs help to target prescribing for children with malaria and HIV. There is emerging evidence that POCT-CRP may better target antibiotic prescribing for children with acute RTIs in LMIC, but not in high-income countries. Research is urgently needed to understand where POCTs are likely to improve clinical outcomes in paediatric settings worldwide.","Van Hecke, Oliver; Raymond, Meriel; Lee, Joseph J; Turner, Philip; Goyder, Clare R; Verbakel, Jan Y; Van den Bruel, Ann; Hayward, Gail",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32628707/,251

DESIGN Systematic review and overview of systematic reviews. DATA SOURCES We systematically searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Scopus for published studies and grey literature databases for unpublished studies from January 1990 to April 2018. METHODS To assess evidence directly addressing our objectives, we conducted a systematic review. Because we were aware of a dearth of direct evidence, we also performed an overview of systematic reviews on leisure activities that mimic formal continuing education. We a priori established the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two authors independently assessed inclusion and exclusion at the abstract and full-text level, rated the risk of bias, and determined the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. We resolved all discrepancies by consensus. We synthesised the available evidence narratively. RESULTS Our searches identified 4933 citations. For the systematic review, only two publications on the same prospective cohort study (Tasmanian Healthy Brain Project) met the inclusion criteria; for the overview of reviews, we included five systematic reviews. Based on 459 participants, preliminary data of the ongoing cohort study indicated that cognitive reserve statistically significantly increased in persons attending university classes compared with the control group (92.5% vs 55.7%, p<0.01). Likewise, language processing capacities statistically significantly improved (p<0.01). Episodic memory, working memory and executive function did not differ significantly between groups. Systematic reviews consistently reported a positive association between participation in cognitively stimulating leisure activities and reduced incidence of dementia and improved cognitive test performance. CONCLUSION Available results demonstrate that cognitive reserve increases through continuing education and show a positive association of cognitive leisure activities with both improved cognitive function and lower dementia incidence.

78863,The development of patient-centric sampling as an enabling technology for clinical trials.,2020-07-06,"BACKGROUND Toxic alcohols have been implicated in accidental ingestions and intentional exposures. Recognition of toxic alcohol poisoning is challenging. The main treatment modalities include antidotes with alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitors and dialysis. Current guidelines exist for both methanol and ethylene glycol intoxication. However, treatment consensus related to other toxic alcohols is limited. Furthermore, uncertainties regarding thresholds for when to initiate antidotes and dialysis persist. As a consequence, variations exist in the interventions utilized for management of all toxic alcohol poisonings. To our knowledge, no prior systematic review of clinical outcomes of toxic alcohols exists. The objective of this study is to summarize existing evidence on short- and long-term outcomes of patients following toxic alcohol poisonings, including methanol, ethylene glycol, isopropanol, propylene glycol, and diethylene glycol. METHODS A literature search in PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE will be performed based on pre-determined criteria. There will be no restrictions on publication dates or languages. The search will be supplemented by manual scan of bibliographies of eligible studies and gray literature assessment. Observational studies and clinical trials will be included in this review. Once eligible studies have been selected based on pre-specified criteria, two investigators will extract relevant data independently and perform quality assessment per validated tools. A pooled analysis of mortality and short- and long-term secondary outcomes will be performed. Pre-specified subgroup analyses will be performed according to the type of toxic alcohol intoxication, mode of renal replacement therapy, and medical interventions received. A meta-analysis will be performed if three or more studies with similar populations, type of toxic alcohol poisoning, and outcome measures, as well as adequate quality, are identified. This review will be reported according to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement. DISCUSSION This systematic review aims to synthesize current evidence in the short- and long-term outcomes of post-toxic alcohol poisoning. The results will enhance the understanding of patient morbidity and mortality after toxic alcohol poisoning, help inform uniform concrete management guideline development, identify gaps in the current state of knowledge, and provide evidence to help implement post-treatment follow-up.

Low-dose submicron diclofenac was developed using a new, proprietary dry milling process that creates submicron drug particles (SoluMatrix Fine Particle Technology * ), enabling effective treatment at lower doses than other commercially available diclofenac drug products. This phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of low-dose submicron diclofenac 35 mg three times daily (tid) and twice daily (bid) in patients with OA pain. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This double-blind study enrolled patients ≥40 years of age with clinically and radiographically confirmed (Kellgren-Lawrence grade II-III) hip or knee OA. Eligible patients were chronic NSAID and/or acetaminophen (APAP) users with baseline Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale scores ≥40 mm by visual analog scale and an OA flare (≥15 mm increase in WOMAC pain subscale score following discontinuation of NSAIDs/APAP at screening). Patients were randomized to submicron diclofenac 35 mg tid, submicron diclofenac 35 mg bid, or placebo for 12 weeks. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01461369. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Efficacy parameters included mean change from baseline in WOMAC pain subscale score at week 12 (primary efficacy parameter) and in average total WOMAC score over 12 weeks. RESULTS Submicron diclofenac 35 mg tid significantly improved WOMAC pain subscale scores from baseline at 12 weeks (-44.1; p = 0.0024) compared with placebo (-32.5). Submicron diclofenac 35 mg bid provided numerical improvement in pain at week 12 that did not reach statistical significance (-39.0; p = 0.0795) compared with placebo. Submicron diclofenac 35 mg tid (-35.9; p = 0.0002) and 35 mg bid (-30.3; p = 0.0363) improved the average total WOMAC score in treated patients over 12 weeks compared with placebo (-23.2). The most frequent AEs in the submicron diclofenac-treated groups were diarrhea, headache, nausea, and constipation. The inclusion of patients with a documented requirement for analgesic therapy (OA 'flare') at baseline and the high rates of rescue medication usage in the placebo group may have impacted the study outcome for the submicron diclofenac treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS Low-dose submicron diclofenac is an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of OA pain.","Gibofsky, Allan; Hochberg, Marc C; Jaros, Mark J; Young, Clarence L",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1185/03007995.2014.946123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25050589/,251
80422,In This Issue.,2015,"The accessibility of pharmacies may be an overlooked contributor to persistent racial and ethnic disparities in the use of prescription medications and essential health care services within urban areas in the US. We examined the availability and geographic accessibility of pharmacies across neighborhoods based on their racial/ethnic composition in the thirty most populous US cities. In all cities examined, we found persistently fewer pharmacies located in Black and Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods than White or diverse neighborhoods throughout 2007-15. In 2015 there were disproportionately more pharmacy deserts in Black or Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods than in White or diverse neighborhoods, including those that are not federally designated Medically Underserved Areas. These disparities were most pronounced in Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; Baltimore, Maryland; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Dallas, Texas; Boston, Massachusetts; and Albuquerque, New Mexico. We also found that Black and Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods were more likely to experience pharmacy closures compared with other neighborhoods. Our findings suggest that efforts to increase access to medications and essential health care services, including in response to COVID-19, should consider policies that ensure equitable pharmacy accessibility across neighborhoods in US cities. Such efforts could include policies that encourage pharmacies to locate in pharmacy deserts, including increases to Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rates for pharmacies most at risk for closure.","Guadamuz, Jenny S; Wilder, Jocelyn R; Mouslim, Morgane C; Zenk, Shannon N; Alexander, G Caleb; Qato, Dima Mazen",Health affairs,https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.01699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33939507/,251

METHODS Thirty-six novice surgeons in the final year of medical school with minimal surgical experience were taught surgical knot tying and small bowel suturing. The students were asked to complete 7 small bowel anastomosis in 7 separate sessions. The quality of the final product was assessed looking at the ""fine details"" (number of sutures and accuracy, ie, ratio of sutures piercing the full thickness of the bowel) and the ""gross apposition"" of the bowel ends at the anastomotic site. A grading system for apposition was devised to assess apposition. RESULTS The results with fine details and accuracy of suturing revealed that female surgeons were significantly better in the fourth to the sixth sessions with no gender difference in the number of sutures placed. With gross apposition at the anastomotic ends, male surgeons were consistently better between the third to the sixth session. However, these differences were eliminated with training. CONCLUSIONS Known gender differences in visuospatial ability and manual dexterity may explain the initial gender differences in the quality of the final product. However, these differences were not present by the end of the training sessions. Therefore, with training, no difference in surgical technical ability was found between male and female novice surgeons.","Masud, Dhalia; Undre, Shabnam; Darzi, Ara",Journal of surgical education,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2011.01.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21481801/,251
80902,Resident and Fellow Training in a Pandemic.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND Weight regain following bariatric surgery is common and potentially compromises the health benefits initially attained after surgery. Poor compliance to dietary and physical activity prescriptions is believed to be largely responsible for weight regain. Patients may benefit from developing specialized psychological skills necessary to engage in positive health behaviors over the long term. Unfortunately, patients often face challenges to physically returning to the bariatric surgery program for support in developing and maintaining these behaviors. Remotely delivered interventions, in contrast, can be conveniently delivered to the patient and have been found efficacious for a number of health problems, including obesity. To date, they have received little attention with bariatric surgery patients. The study aimed to evaluate a newly developed, remote acceptance-based behavioral intervention for postoperative weight regain. METHODS Patients at least 1.5 years out from surgery who experienced postoperative weight regain were recruited to receive the 10-week intervention. Participants were assessed at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3-month follow-up. RESULTS Support for the intervention's feasibility and acceptability was achieved, with 70 % retention among those who started the program and a high mean rating (4.7 out of 5.0) of program satisfaction among study completers. On average, weight regain was reversed with a mean weight loss of 5.1 ± 5.5 % throughout the intervention. This weight loss was maintained at 3-month follow-up. Significant improvements in eating-related and acceptance-based variables also were observed. CONCLUSIONS This pilot study provides initial support for the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a remotely delivered acceptance-based behavioral intervention for postoperative weight regain.","Bradley, Lauren E; Forman, Evan M; Kerrigan, Stephanie G; Goldstein, Stephanie P; Butryn, Meghan L; Thomas, J Graham; Herbert, James D; Sarwer, David B",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-016-2337-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27586525/,251
80922,Swyer-James syndrome associated with asthma and a giant bulla.,2014,"BACKGROUND In March 2014, the World Health Organization was notified of an outbreak of Zaire ebolavirus in a remote area of Guinea. The outbreak then spread to the capital, Conakry, and to neighboring countries and has subsequently become the largest epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) to date. METHODS From March 25 to April 26, 2014, we performed a study of all patients with laboratory-confirmed EVD in Conakry. Mortality was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included patient characteristics, complications, treatments, and comparisons between survivors and nonsurvivors. RESULTS Of 80 patients who presented with symptoms, 37 had laboratory-confirmed EVD. Among confirmed cases, the median age was 38 years (interquartile range, 28 to 46), 24 patients (65%) were men, and 14 (38%) were health care workers; among the health care workers, nosocomial transmission was implicated in 12 patients (32%). Patients with confirmed EVD presented to the hospital a median of 5 days (interquartile range, 3 to 7) after the onset of symptoms, most commonly with fever (in 84% of the patients; mean temperature, 38.6°C), fatigue (in 65%), diarrhea (in 62%), and tachycardia (mean heart rate, >93 beats per minute). Of these patients, 28 (76%) were treated with intravenous fluids and 37 (100%) with antibiotics. Sixteen patients (43%) died, with a median time from symptom onset to death of 8 days (interquartile range, 7 to 11). Patients who were 40 years of age or older, as compared with those under the age of 40 years, had a relative risk of death of 3.49 (95% confidence interval, 1.42 to 8.59; P=0.007). CONCLUSIONS Patients with EVD presented with evidence of dehydration associated with vomiting and severe diarrhea. Despite attempts at volume repletion, antimicrobial therapy, and limited laboratory services, the rate of death was 43%.","Bah, Elhadj Ibrahima; Lamah, Marie-Claire; Fletcher, Tom; Jacob, Shevin T; Brett-Major, David M; Sall, Amadou Alpha; Shindo, Nahoko; Fischer, William A; Lamontagne, Francois; Saliou, Sow Mamadou; Bausch, Daniel G; Moumié, Barry; Jagatic, Tim; Sprecher, Armand; Lawler, James V; Mayet, Thierry; Jacquerioz, Frederique A; Méndez Baggi, María F; Vallenas, Constanza; Clement, Christophe; Mardel, Simon; Faye, Ousmane; Faye, Oumar; Soropogui, Baré; Magassouba, Nfaly; Koivogui, Lamine; Pinto, Ruxandra; Fowler, Robert A",The New England journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa1411249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25372658/,251
81418,Response to Wewer Albrechtsen NJ: The glucose-mobilizing effect of glucagon at fasting is mediated by cyclic AMP.,2021-08-09,"Background & objectives : In the context of India's ongoing resurgence of COVID-19 (second wave since mid-February 2021, following the subsiding of the first wave in September 2020), there has been increasing speculation on the possibility of a future third wave of infection, posing a burden on the healthcare system. Using simple mathematical models of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, this study examined the conditions under which a serious third wave could occur. Methods : Using a deterministic, compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, four potential mechanisms for a third wave were examined: (i) waning immunity restores previously exposed individuals to a susceptible state, (ii) emergence of a new viral variant that is capable of escaping immunity to previously circulating strains, (iii) emergence of a new viral variant that is more transmissible than the previously circulating strains, and (iv) release of current lockdowns affording fresh opportunities for transmission. Results : Immune-mediated mechanisms (waning immunity, or viral evolution for immune escape) are unlikely to drive a severe third wave if acting on their own, unless such mechanisms lead to a complete loss of protection among those previously exposed. Likewise, a new, more transmissible variant would have to exceed a high threshold (R0>4.5) to cause a third wave on its own. However, plausible mechanisms for a third wave include: (i) a new variant that is more transmissible and at the same time capable of escaping prior immunity, and (ii) lockdowns that are highly effective in limiting transmission and subsequently released. In both cases, any third wave seems unlikely to be as severe as the second wave. Rapid scale-up of vaccination efforts could play an important role in mitigating these and future waves of the disease. Interpretation & conclusions : This study demonstrates plausible mechanisms by which a substantial third wave could occur, while also illustrating that it is unlikely for any such resurgence to be as large as the second wave. Model projections are, however, subject to several uncertainties, and it remains important to scale up vaccination coverage to mitigate against any eventuality. Preparedness planning for any potential future wave will benefit by drawing upon the projected numbers based on the present modelling exercise.","Mandal, Sandip; Arinaminpathy, Nimalan; Bhargava, Balram; Panda, Samiran",The Indian journal of medical research,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_1627_21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34213435/,251
81634,Ablative technologies in the management of patients with primary and secondary liver cancer: an overview.,2010,"Certain chronic comorbidities, including diabetes, are highly prevalent in people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and are associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 and mortality. Mild glucose elevations are also common in COVID-19 patients and associated with worse outcomes even in people without diabetes. Several studies have recently reported new-onset diabetes associated with COVID-19. The phenomenon of new-onset diabetes following admission to the hospital has been observed previously with other viral infections and acute illnesses. The precise mechanisms for new-onset diabetes in people with COVID-19 are not known, but it is likely that a number of complex interrelated processes are involved, including previously undiagnosed diabetes, stress hyperglycemia, steroid-induced hyperglycemia, and direct or indirect effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the β-cell. There is an urgent need for research to help guide management pathways for these patients. In view of increased mortality in people with new-onset diabetes, hospital protocols should include efforts to recognize and manage acute hyperglycemia, including diabetic ketoacidosis, in people admitted to the hospital. Whether new-onset diabetes is likely to remain permanent is not known, as the long-term follow-up of these patients is limited. Prospective studies of metabolism in the setting of postacute COVID-19 will be required to understand the etiology, prognosis, and treatment opportunities.","Khunti, Kamlesh; Del Prato, Stefano; Mathieu, Chantal; Kahn, Steven E; Gabbay, Robert A; Buse, John B",Diabetes care,https://doi.org/10.2337/dc21-1318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34625431/,251
82088,Making oral pathology lemonade from COVID-19 lemons.,2020-10-24,"STUDY QUESTION Can the baboon uterus support a gestation to livebirth with an angiosome using microsurgically anastomosed utero-ovarian vessels and lacking uterine arteries and veins? SUMMARY ANSWER Our angiosome model allows healthy livebirth albeit with risk of fetal growth restriction and stillbirth. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Uterine transplant can provide livebirth in humans, but requires a living donor to undergo a prolonged laparotomy for hysterectomy. In an attempt to avoid the time-consuming dissection of the uterine vein, our group has previously shown maintenance of baboon uterine menstrual function after ligation of the uterine vein and after ligation of both the uterine artery and uterine vein. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION In a 19-month timespan, three baboons underwent laparotomy to surgically alter uterine perfusion, and pregnancy outcomes were monitored after spontaneous mating in a breeding colony. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Three nulligravid female Papio hamadryas baboons in a breeding colony underwent laparotomy to ligate uterine arteries and veins along with colpotomy and cervico-vaginal anastomosis. During the same surgery, the utero-ovarian arteries and veins were microsurgically transected and re-anastomosed to themselves. Intraoperative organ perfusion was confirmed with laser angiography. After a recovery period, monitoring of menstrual cycling via menstrual blood flow and sex-skin cycling occurred, as well as uterine viability via sonography and cervical biopsy. Each baboon was released to the breeding colony for spontaneous mating and pregnancies dated by menstrual calendar and compared with early ultrasound. Delivery outcomes were monitored in each including neonate weight and placental pathology. In the event of a stillbirth, the animal was returned to the breeding colony for repeat mating attempts. After achieving a livebirth, the maternal baboon was removed from the study. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Each baboon in the trial underwent successful surgery with all uteri demonstrating viability and return of menstrual function within 10 weeks of surgery. Pregnancies occurred within two menstrual cycles in breeding colony. Baboons one and two initially had vaginal breech stillbirths, both with appearance of placental insufficiency, and one with fetal growth restriction. Baboon three underwent scheduled cesarean delivery resulting in a normally grown livebirth. Baboon one had a subsequent pregnancy resulting in a livebirth via cesarean delivery. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Stillbirth in two of four gestations, and fetal growth restriction in one of four, are the largest concerns in our perfusion model. It remains uncertain whether the stillbirths resulted from placental insufficiency, or birth trauma from breech deliveries. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The success of two livebirths warrants further attempts at improving consistency of our proposed uterine angiosome. This may allow living uterine donors to undergo less-invasive and shorter donor hysterectomy procedures.

82140,Comparison of SLA® or SLActive® implants placed in the maxillary sinus with or without synthetic bone graft materials--an animal study in sheep.,2014,"Laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) is a procedure combining laparoscopic gastric resection with endoscopic submucosal dissection for local resection of gastric tumors with appropriate, minimal surgical resection margins. The LECS concept was initially developed from the classical LECS procedure for gastric submucosal tumor resection. Many researchers reported that classical LECS was a safe and feasible technique for resection of gastric submucosal tumors, regardless of tumor location, including the esophagogastric junction. Recently, LECS was approved for insurance coverage by Japan's National Health Insurance plan and widely applied for gastric submucosal tumor resection. However, the limitations of classical LECS are the risk of abdominal infection, scattering of tumor cells in the abdominal cavity, and tumor cell seeding in the peritoneum. The development of modified LECS procedures, such as inverted-LECS, non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery, a combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic approaches to neoplasia with a non-exposure technique, and closed-LECS, has almost resolved these drawbacks. This has led to a recent increase in the indication of modified LECS to include patients with gastric epithelial neoplasms. The LECS concept is also beginning to be applied to tumor excision in other organs, such as the duodenum, colon and rectum. Further evolution of LECS procedures is expected in the future. Sentinel lymph node mapping could also be combined with LECS, resulting in a portion of early gastric cancers being treated by LECS with sentinel node mapping.","Hiki, Naoki; Nunobe, Souya",Annals of gastroenterological surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/ags3.12238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31131352/,251
82204,The Scourge of Predatory Journals.,2020,"BACKGROUND Arterial stiffness is associated with myocardial ischemia and incident coronary artery disease (CAD), and indexes of arterial stiffness are usually increased in patients with CAD. However, these indexes are often increased in elderly without CAD. Arterial stiffness in patients with CAD may become more evident after isometric handgrip exercise which increases systolic pressure and ventricular afterload. We investigated the association of the change of stiffness indexes after isometric handgrip exercise with the lesion extent of CAD and the necessity for coronary revascularization. METHODS Patients who were scheduled a routine coronary angiography via a femoral artery were enrolled. Arterial waveforms were traced at aortic root and external iliac artery using coronary catheters at baseline and 3 min after handgrip exercise. Augmentation index (AIx) was measured on the recorded aortic pressure waveform, and pulse wave velocity (PWV) was calculated using the ECG-gated time difference of the upstroke of arterial waveforms and distance between aortic root and external iliac artery. RESULTS Total 37 patients were evaluated. Both PWV and AIx increased after handgrip exercise. ΔPWV was significantly correlated with ΔAIx (r = 0.344, P = 0.037). Patients were divided into higher and lower ΔPWV or ΔAIx groups based on the median values of 0.4 m/sec and 3.3%, respectively. Patients with higher PWV had more 2- or 3-vessel CAD (69% vs. 27%, P = 0.034), and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) more frequently (84% vs. 50%, P = 0.038), but higher ΔAIx was not associated with either the lesion extent or PCI. Area under curve (AUC) of ΔPWV in association with PCI by C-statistics was 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.88; P = 0.056). In multiple logistic regression analysis, ΔPWV was significantly associated with PCI (odds ratio 7.78; 95% CI 1.26-48.02; P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS Higher ΔPWV after isometric handgrip exercise was associated with the lesion extent of CAD and the necessity for coronary revascularization, but higher ΔAIx was not.","Kim, Seong Taeg; Ko, Yeekyoung; Beom, Jong-Wook; Boo, Ki Yung; Lee, Jae-Geun; Choi, Joon-Hyouk; Kim, Song-Yi; Joo, Seung-Jae",Clinical hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40885-021-00163-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33931135/,251

PARTICIPANTS Two of eight suburban district were purposely selected according to participant willingness, health service facilities, population, geographic region and electronic medical record system. From these suburban districts, four communities were selected based on economic level and population size. At stage three, one-third of the committees/villages were randomly selected from each community. All residents aged 20-74 years old were invited as study participants. FINDINGS TO DATE The baseline data on demographics, lifestyle and physical health-related factors were collected using a face-to-face questionnaire interview. All participants completed physical examinations and had blood and urine tests. Blood and urine samples from these tests were stored in a biobank. From 6 April 2016 through 31 October 2017, we conducted face-to-face interviews and clinical examinations in 44 887 participants: 35 727 from Songjiang District and 9160 from Jiading District. The average age of participants was 56.4±11.2 years in Songjiang and 56.6±10.5 years in Jiading. The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidaemia was 34.0%, 8.2% and 11.1%, respectively. FUTURE PLANS In-person surveys will be conducted every 5 years. For annual tracking, baseline data was linked to the local health information system, which was composed of an electronic medical record system, a chronic disease management system, a cancer registry system, an infectious disease report system and a death registry system. The data of the SSACB cohort is located in the School of Public Health, Fudan University.

Media coverage has proffered explanations for this differential vulnerability, but psychosocial risk factors have been largely ignored. In contrast, multiple theories, medical and psychological, point to one psychosocial factor - stress - as important to the etiology of disease. They also agree that pathogenic stress arises from the particular circumstance in which adaptational demands overwhelm a person's resources, creating ""stress overload"" that deregulates normal functioning and increases susceptibility to illness. Assessment of stress overload is proposed as essential to understanding viral spread in the current pandemic. Methods: Studies are reviewed explicating (1) stress overload theories and relevant empirical evidence, (2) construction of a stress overload measure and related validity evidence. Results: Findings support the role of stress overload in illness and the accuracy of the measure in predicting illness. Conclusion: It is concluded that assessment of stress overload may help to explain the observed coronavirus disparities, and to identify populations at risk for imminent infection. The 10-item Stress Overload Scale-Short is offered as a potentially useful tool for researchers and clinicians working to map, and stem, the proliferation of coronavirus.","Amirkhan, James H","Anxiety, stress, and coping",https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2020.1824271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32960675/,251

In this study, the prevalence rates of porcine AstV types 1-5 (PAstV1-PAstV5) were investigated using faecal samples from 509 pigs of which 488 (95.9%) came from farms with a history of diarrhoea. All of the five known PAstV types were found to circulate in pigs in the USA, and co-infection of a single pig with two or more PAstV types was frequently observed. A high overall prevalence of 64.0% (326/509) of PAstV RNA-positive samples was detected, with 97.2% (317/326) of the PAstV RNA-positive pigs infected with PAstV4. Further genomic sequencing and characterization of the selected isolates revealed low sequence identities (49.2-89.0%) with known PAstV strains, indicating novel types or genotypes of PAstV2, PAstV4 and PAstV5. Some new features of the genomes of the PAstVs were also discovered. The first complete genome of a PAstV3 isolate was obtained and showed identities of 50.5-55.3% with mink AstV and the novel human AstVs compared with 38.4-42.7% with other PAstV types. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PAstV1, PAstV2 and PAstV3 were more closely related to AstVs from humans and other animals than to each other, indicating past cross-species transmission and the zoonotic potential of these PAstVs.","Xiao, Chao-Ting; Giménez-Lirola, Luis G; Gerber, Priscilla F; Jiang, Yong-Hou; Halbur, Patrick G; Opriessnig, Tanja",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.048744-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23223616/,251

To explore complex associations among demographic factors, risk factors, health care, and fatality rates of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Methods. We based this study on analysis of a publicly accessible line listing of 1256 MERS-CoV cases (2013 to October 2018) available on the World Health Organization's Web site. For analyses of demographic factors (e.g., age, gender), access to health care, promptness of laboratory services, risk factors (comorbidity, exposure to camels and persons with MERS-CoV), occupation (health care), and outcome (fatality), we used descriptive statistics, risk ratio (RR), and the Pearson χ2 test. Results. Presence of comorbidity (RR = 3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.2, 3.9), being male (RR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2, 2.1), exposure to dromedary camels (RR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.3, 2.3), and consumption of camel milk (RR = 1.5; 95% CI = 0.9, 1.7) can significantly increase risk for fatality. Health care workers have significantly lower fatality (P < .001) than the rest of the persons with MERS-CoV. Conclusions. Policies that promote health awareness for the high-risk population and their prompt seeking of health care should be considered. Publicly accessible line lists of infectious diseases such as MERS-CoV can be valuable sources for epidemiological analysis. (Am J Public Health.

OCT can be synthesized by using unsubstituted benzophenone (BP), a possible human carcinogen. OBJECTIVES To verify if, and to what extent, BP residues are present in OCT-containing consumer products. METHODS The raw material of OCT and 39 skincare products, of which 28 containing OCT, were chemically analyzed for the presence of BP by means of Liquid Chromatography (LC). RESULTS In the OCT raw material and in all 28 OCT-containing products the presence of BP could be demonstrated, mostly in concentrations above 10 ppm (0.001%), whereas a majority of OCT-free products (8/11; 73%) did not contain BP. Moreover, BP concentrations significantly increased, in a time- and temperature-dependent manner, likely due to the additional degradation of OCT. CONCLUSIONS Photo-allergic contact dermatitis from OCT in patients photo-sensitized to KP might rely on residual BP impurities. Toxicological and ecological studies that evaluate the safety of OCT might also need to consider the concomitant presence of BP. This article is protected by copyright.

It is also important for quality of life, including from the perspectives of those living in long-term care (LTC) homes. However, given the characteristics of the LTC home environment and the people who live there, the nature and influence of social integration and loneliness, and strategies to address them, may differ in this population compared with those living in the community. The objective of this scoping review is to provide an overview of the nature and extent of research on social integration and loneliness among LTC home residents, including a summary of how these concepts have been operationalised and any evidence from specific groups. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This study protocol describes the methods of a scoping review of peer-reviewed literature related to social integration and loneliness among LTC home residents. A literature search was developed by an Information Specialist and will be conducted in MEDLINE(R) ALL (in Ovid, including Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily) and then translated into CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (Ovid), Scopus, Sociological Abstracts (Proquest), Embase and Embase Classic (Ovid), Emcare Nursing (Ovid) and AgeLine (EBSCO). Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts of articles identified in the search. Two reviewers will then independently review full text articles for inclusion. Data extraction will also be carried out in duplicate. We will engage LTC home community members, including residents, family and staff, to refine the review questions, assist in interpreting the results and participate in knowledge translation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not required. We will present findings at conferences and publish in a peer-reviewed journal. Ultimately, we hope to inform future observational and interventional research aimed at improving the health and quality of life of LTC home residents.","Bethell, Jennifer; Babineau, Jessica; Iaboni, Andrea; Green, Robin; Cuaresma-Canlas, Rachelle; Karunananthan, Roobika; Schon, Barbara; Schon, Denise; McGilton, Katherine S",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31822544/,251

However, a considerable number of patients presenting with possible small bowel obstruction (SBO) after laparoscopic RYGB do not always have internal herniation. PURPOSE The aim of our study was to determine the causes of SBO for patients in which both potential internal hernia spaces were closed at the time of the original operation. SETTING Academic Practice, USA. MATERIALS AND METHODS Of 2,395 patients who underwent laparoscopic RYGB between January 2004 and October 2012, a total of 93 (3.9 %) patients were reoperated for possible SBO at our institution. A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was performed for all patients. RESULTS A total of 93 patients had 105 reoperations in the study period, resulting in a reoperation rate for possible SBO of 3.9 %. The mean time period between the laparoscopic RYGB and the first 93 reoperations was 20.9 ± 18.1 months (range 0-100). Eleven patients required secondary reoperations at a mean period of 20.1 ± 17.7 months (range 0-52) after the first reoperation. Of these 105 reoperations, 29 (27.6 %) showed internal herniation at the mesenteric defect (N = 23), Peterson's defect (N = 5), and both (N = 1). A total of 50 (47.6 %) reoperations revealed extensive adhesions causing SBO. Of these 50 cases, 12 revealed adhesions at the jejunojejunostomy, causing it to kink and obstruct. Ten (9.5 %) cases showed intussusception of the jejunojejunal anastomosis. Overall, reoperation rate due to internal herniation was 1.1 % in our patient population. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate a 3.9 % reoperation rate for abdominal pain and SBO, and more than 45 % of these patients had symptoms secondary to adhesions. Only 1.1 % of our laparoscopic RYGB patients developed internal herniation after closure of both internal hernia spaces.","Elms, Luke; Moon, Rena C; Varnadore, Sheila; Teixeira, Andre F; Jawad, Muhammad A",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3361-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24380988/,251
85276,Eruptive vellus hair cysts diagnosed using dermatological imaging technique.,2020-09-20,"Owing to their low cost and high theoretical energy density, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are highly promising as a contender for post-lithium ion battery era. However, the intrinsic low reversible conversion ability of lithium polysulﬁdes to sulfur/Li2S during charging/discharging seriously hinder the sulfur utilization, resulting in poor cycling life of batteries. Herein we report an improvement of core-shell structured sulfur nanospheres@ultrathin δ-MnO2 nanosheets electrode materials prepared by a simple precipitation reaction method, in which the ultrathin δ-MnO2 nanosheets as a catalytic layer can promote the chemical adsorption of lithium polysulﬁdes and their conversion rates to sulfur/Li2S. Using a combination of UV-visible adsorption spectra and ﬁrst-principles calculation, the results indicate that the Mn-O coordination center on the surface of MnO2 structure plays an efficient catalytic role in the conversion reaction of lithium polysulﬁdes to insoluble S/Li2S. The sulfur nanospheres@ultrathin δ-MnO2 nanosheets composite with a high S mass ratio of 82 wt % reveal a high speciﬁc capacity of 846 mAh g-1 at 1C rate and good cycling stability. Moreover, the areal capacity of the electrode with high sulfur loading mass of 10 mg cm-2 is 5.2 mAh cm-2 , approaching the practical application standard at a current density of 1 mA cm-2.","Li, Qing; Ma, Zhipeng; Li, Jiaojiao; Liu, Zhan; Fan, Lukai; Qin, Xiujuan; Shao, Guangjie",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c09583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667773/,251

85889,Use of Oral Contrast in Abdominal/Pelvic CT Scans.,2020-09-16,"BACKGROUND Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a recognized complication in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Currently, no standard exists for optimal timing or a pharmacological agent for VTE prophylaxis (pharmacological thromboprophylaxis - PTP) in patients with TBI. PTP is often delayed out of fear of causing extension of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The purpose of this study was to report the frequency of VTE and ICH progression after initiation of PTP with a continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin in patients with moderate to severe TBI, and to identify risk factors associated with development of VTE. METHODS In this single-center retrospective study, patients with moderate to severe TBI admitted to the ICU of a Swiss Level I Trauma Center over a three-year period were analyzed. RESULTS In 23 (13%) of the 177 patients included in the study a VTE episode occurred during the hospital stay. ICH progression after initiation of PTP occurred in 7 (4%) patients. In a multivariable logistic regression model, only the timing of initiation of PTP was identified as an independent predictor of VTE. CONCLUSIONS In this study population, the risk of developing VTE increased with the delay of initiation of a pharmacological VTE prophylaxis, while ICH progression after initiation of PTP was a rare event.","Brandi, Giovanna; Schmidlin, Adrian; Klinzing, Stephanie; Schüpbach, Reto; Unseld, Simone; Pagnamenta, Alberto",Anaesthesiology intensive therapy,https://doi.org/10.5114/ait.2020.93395; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32191827/,251

In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to discover the different clinical characteristics between severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19 to find the potential risk factors and predictors of this disease's severity, as well as to serve as a guidance for subsequent epidemic prevention and control work. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase and other databases were searched to collect studies on the difference of clinical characteristics of severe and non-severe patients. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software, and the funnel plots could be made to evaluate the publication bias. P>0.05 means no statistical significance. Furthermore, a meta-regression analysis was performed by using Stata 15.0 to find the potential factors of the high degree of heterogeneity (I2>50%). Sixteen studies have been included, with 1,172 severe patients and 2,803 non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were more likely to have the symptoms of dyspnea, hemoptysis, and the complications of ARDS, shock, secondary infection, acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac injury. Interestingly, the former smokers were more prevalent in severe cases as compared to non-severe cases, but there was no difference between the two groups of 'current smokers'. Except for chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease, the underlying comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, cerebrovascular disease, and HIV can make the disease worse. In terms of laboratory indicators, the decreased lymphocyte and platelet count, and the increased levels of white blood cell (WBC), D-dimer, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and C-reactive protein were more prevalent in severe patients. Meta-regression analysis showed that patient age, gender, and proportion of severe cases did not significantly impact on the outcomes of any clinical indexes that showed high degree of heterogeneity in the meta-analysis. In conclusion, the severity of COVID-19 could be evaluated by, radiologic finding, some symptoms like dyspnea and hemoptysis, some laboratory indicators, and smoking history, especially the ex-smokers. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were more likely to have complications and comorbidities including hypertension, cardiovascular disease etc., which were the risk factors for the disease to be severer, but the chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease were not associated the severity of COVID-19 in China.","Zhang, Tao; Huang, Wei-Sen; Guan, Weijie; Hong, Ziying; Gao, Jiabo; Gao, Guoying; Wu, Guofeng; Qin, Yin-Yin",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-20-1743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447431/,251

MATERIALS AND METHODS Start parameters for the model were obtained from observational data after data-smoothing to reduce between-day variation. Three scenarios, 1) no vaccination, 2) vaccination of 60% of the population over 12 months, 3) vaccination of 60% of the population over 7 months were examined. The effects of changes in tα (doubling-time for the spread of infection, known to be slower in the summer months) and tβ (half-life of recovery from infection) on the daily number of infectious persons, the cumulative number of infected persons, and the duration of critical occupancy of intensive-care units were also determined. RESULTS Vaccination produced a marked and rapid reduction in the number of infectious persons (up to -60%) and the total number of infected persons (up to -70%). A 7-month vaccination strategy was significantly more effective than a 12-month strategy. The summer effect came too late to have an additional effect on the spread of infection. Vaccination was predicted to reduce the duration of critical occupancy of intensive-care facilities by ~ 70%. DISCUSSION The predictions are based on the assumptions that lockdown conditions are maintained and vaccine availability is not limiting. CONCLUSION Predictions made using the model show that vaccination with a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine can markedly reduce the spread of the COVID-19 disease and the period of critical occupancy of intensive-care facilities in Germany.","Braun, Peter; Braun, Julian; Woodcock, Barry G",International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.5414/cp203988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33605876/,251

Several genes associated with protein ubiquitination have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. HECW2-related disorder has been established through the identification of de novo variants in HECW2 in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders with hypotonia, seizures, and absent language. Recently, we identified novel HECW2 variants in four Japanese patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. Regarding motor development, two of the patients cannot walk, whereas the other two can walk with an unsteady gait, owing to hypotonia. All HECW2 variants, including those that were previously reported, are missense, and no loss-of-function variants have been identified. Most of the identified variants are located around the HECT domain. These findings suggest that the dominant negative effects of missense variants around the HECT domain may be the mechanism underlying HECW2-related disorder.","Yanagishita, Tomoe; Hirade, Takuya; Shimojima Yamamoto, Keiko; Funatsuka, Makoto; Miyamoto, Yusaku; Maeda, Makiko; Yanagi, Kumiko; Kaname, Tadashi; Nagata, Satoru; Nagata, Miho; Ishihara, Yasuki; Miyashita, Yohei; Asano, Yoshihiro; Sakata, Yasushi; Kosaki, Kenjiro; Yamamoto, Toshiyuki",American journal of medical genetics.

86524,Petechiae Over Face: A Case of Rumpel-Leede Phenomenon.,2020,"BACKGROUND The Shouldice method and other tissue-based techniques are still acknowledged to be acceptable for primary inguinal hernia repair according to the European Hernia Society guidelines. Desarda's technique, presented in 2001, is an original hernia repair method using an undetached strip of external oblique aponeurosis. This randomized trial compared outcomes after hernia repair with Desarda (D) and mesh-based Lichtenstein (L) techniques. METHODS A total of 208 male patients were randomly assigned to the D or L group (105 vs. 103, respectively). The primary outcomes measured were recurrence and chronic pain. Additionally, early and late complications, foreign body sensation, and return to everyday activity were examined in hospital and at 7, 30 days, and 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after surgery. RESULTS During the follow-up, two recurrences were observed in each group (p = 1.000). Chronic pain was experienced by 4.8 and 2.9% of patients from groups D and L, respectively (p = 0.464). Foreign body sensation and return to activity were not different between the groups. There was significantly less seroma production in the D group (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS The results of primary inguinal hernia repair with the Desarda and Lichtenstein techniques are comparable at the 3-year follow-up. The technique may potentially increase the number of tissue-based methods available for treating groin hernias.","Szopinski, Jacek; Dabrowiecki, Stanislaw; Pierscinski, Stanislaw; Jackowski, Marek; Jaworski, Maciej; Szuflet, Zbigniew",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-012-1508-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22392354/,251
86897,Polycystic ovary syndrome and assisted reproduction: splitters versus lumpers.,2020-10-20,"Maintenance of upright standing posture has often been explained using the inverted pendulum model. This model considers the ankle plantarflexors to act as a single synergistic group. There are differences in muscle properties among the medial and lateral gastrocnemius (MG and LG, respectively) and the soleus that may affect their activation. Twelve volunteers participated in an investigation to determine whether the activation of the ankle plantarflexor muscles was modulated according to perturbation direction during unilateral standing perturbations of 1% body mass. High-density surface electromyography (HDS-EMG) was used to determine the amplitude and barycenter of the muscle activation and kinematic analysis was used to evaluate ankle, knee, and hip joint movement. The HDS-EMG amplitude and barycenter of MG and LG were modulated with the perturbation direction (MG p < 0.05; LG p < 0.01; one-way repeated-measures ANOVA). In soleus, the HDS-EMG barycenter modulated across the perturbation direction (p < 0.01 for X&Y coordinates), but the HDS-EMG amplitude did not change. A repeated-measures correlation was used to interpret the HDS-EMG pattern in the context of the kinematics. The relative contribution of MG activation compared to the total gastrocnemii activation was significantly associated with ankle dorsi/plantarflexion (rrm = 0.620), knee flexion/extension and abduction/adduction (rrm = 0.622 and rrm = 0.547, respectively), and hip flexion/extension and abduction/adduction (rrm = 0.653 and rrm = 0.432, respectively). The findings suggest that the central nervous system activates motor units within different regions of MG, LG and SOL in response to standing perturbations in different directions.","Cohen, J W; Gallina, A; Ivanova, T D; Vieira, T; McAndrew, D J; Garland, S J",Experimental brain research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-019-05696-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31760455/,251

87220,Proximal ureteral access for symptomatic stone removal using ultrathin semirigid ureterorenoscope in preschool-age children: Is it possible?,2021-06-14,"The concurrent use of opioids, benzodiazepines (BZDs), and/or alcohol poses a formidable challenge for clinicians who manage chronic pain. While the escalating use of opioid analgesics for the treatment of chronic pain and the concomitant rise in opioid-related abuse and misuse are widely recognized trends, the contribution of combination use of BZDs, alcohol, and/or other sedative agents to opioid-related morbidity and mortality is underappreciated, even when these agents are used appropriately. Patients with chronic pain who use opioid analgesics along with BZDs and/or alcohol are at higher risk for fatal/nonfatal overdose and have more aberrant behaviors. Few practice guidelines for BZD treatment are readily available, especially when they are combined clinically with opioid analgesics and other central nervous system-depressant agents. However, coadministration of these agents produces a defined increase in rates of adverse events, overdose, and death, warranting close monitoring and consideration when treating patients with pain. To improve patient outcomes, ongoing screening for aberrant behavior, monitoring of treatment compliance, documentation of medical necessity, and the adjustment of treatment to clinical changes are essential. In this article, we review the prevalence and pharmacologic consequences of BZDs and/or alcohol use among patients with pain on chronic opioid therapy, as well as the importance of urine drug testing, an indispensable tool for therapeutic drug monitoring, which helps to ensure the continued safety of patients. Regardless of risk or known aberrant drug-related behaviors, patients on chronic opioid therapy should periodically undergo urine drug testing to confirm adherence to the treatment plan.","Gudin, Jeffrey A; Mogali, Shanthi; Jones, Jermaine D; Comer, Sandra D",Postgraduate medicine,https://doi.org/10.3810/pgm.2013.07.2684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23933900/,251

In this study, we investigate whether medical or surgical control of reflux is associated with a decreased risk of progression to dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS We retrospectively collected and analyzed data from a cohort of Barrett's esophagus patients participating in this single-center study comprised of all patients diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus at NorthShore University Health System hospitals and clinics over a 10-year period. Patients were followed in order to identify those progressing from Barrett's esophagus to low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. We collected information from the patient's electronic medical records regarding demographic, endoscopic findings, histological findings, smoking/alcohol history, medication use including proton-pump inhibitors, and history of bariatric and antireflux surgery. Risk-adjusted modeling was performed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS This study included 1,830 total Barrett's esophagus patients, 102 of which had their Barrett's esophagus progress to low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, or esophageal adenocarcinoma (confirmed by biopsy) with an annual incidence rate of 1.1%. Mean follow-up period was 5.51 years (10,083 patient-years). Compared to the group that did not progress, the group that progressed was older (69.3 ± 13.7 vs. 63.9 ± 13.4 years. p < 0.001) and likely to be male (75 vs. 61%, p < 0.01). In the multivariable analysis, patients who had a history of antireflux surgery (n = 44) or proton-pump inhibitor use without surgery (n = 1,641) were found to progress at significantly lower rates than patients who did not have antireflux surgery or were not taking PPI's (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.09-0.36). CONCLUSIONS Reflux control was associated with decreased risk of progression to low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, or esophageal adenocarcinoma. These results support the use of reflux control strategies such as proton-pump inhibitor therapy or surgery in patients with non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus for the prevention of progression to dysplasia/adenocarcinoma.","Brown, Craig S; Lapin, Brittany; Wang, Chi; Goldstein, Jay L; Linn, John G; Denham, Woody; Haggerty, Stephen P; Talamonti, Mark S; Howington, John A; Carbray, Joann; Ujiki, Michael B",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4103-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25676204/,251

The literature comparing SILS to conventional laparoscopic surgery for treatment of this disease is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of SILS compared with conventional laparoscopic resection for GIST. METHODS A retrospective case-cohort study compared the benefits and outcomes of SILS and conventional laparoscopic partial gastrectomy for GIST. Between April 2008 and December 2012, 39 patients underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric stromal tumors in our department. All operations were performed by a single experienced surgeon. The medical records of these patients were reviewed retrospectively with regard to tumor size, operating time, and other clinical features. RESULTS SILS resection was performed on 19 patients, whereas 20 patients had conventional laparoscopic resection. Compared with the conventional laparoscopic group, the operative time for the SILS group was shorter, but the time for recovery of gastrointestinal function and postoperative hospital stay for the SILS group was similar to that of the conventional laparoscopic group. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were recorded in either group. CONCLUSION Compared with the conventional laparoscopic procedure, SILS in gastric stromal tumors is as feasible and safe when performed by experienced surgeons.","Kong, Jing; Wu, Shuo-Dong; Su, Yang; Fan, Ying",OncoTargets and therapy,https://doi.org/10.2147/ott.s62687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24959086/,251

METHODS A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database was performed for patients who underwent ablation of a hepatic colorectal cancer metastasis in the operating room from April 1996 to March 2010. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox models were used to determine recurrence rates and assess significance. RESULTS Ablation was performed in 10% (n = 158 patients) of all cases during the study period. Seventy-eight percent were performed in conjunction with a liver resection. Of the 315 tumors ablated, most tumors were ≤ 1 cm in maximum diameter (53%). Radiofrequency ablation was used to treat most of the tumors (70%). Thirty-six tumors (11%) had local recurrence as part of their recurrence pattern. Disease recurred in the liver or systemically after 212 tumors (67%) were ablated. On univariate analysis, tumor size greater than 1 cm was associated with a significantly increased risk of local recurrence (hazard ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.2-4.5, P = 0.013). The 2 year ablation zone recurrence-free survival was 92% for tumors ≤ 1 cm compared to 81% for tumors >1 cm. On multivariate analysis, tumor size of >1 cm, lack of postoperative chemotherapy, and use of cryotherapy were significantly associated with a higher local recurrence rate. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative ablation appears to be highly effective treatment for hepatic colorectal tumors ≤ 1 cm.","Kingham, T Peter; Tanoue, Michael; Eaton, Anne; Rocha, Flavio G; Do, Richard; Allen, Peter; De Matteo, Ronald P; D'Angelica, Michael; Fong, Yuman; Jarnagin, William R",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-011-2048-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21879262/,251

Clinical feature of culture-negative PJI (CN-PJI) has not been well studied till now. In our study, we retrospectively analyzed long-term clinical results after two-stage revision arthroplasty using an antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer for CN-PJI. The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical features and prognosis of CN-PJI after hip arthroplasty and to compare these with those of culture-positive PJI (CP-PJI). METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 15 CN-PJI cases and 70 CP-PJI cases following hip arthroplasty. The average follow-up period was 7.4 years (5-11.7 years). The demographics, laboratory findings, the time interval between antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer insertion and revision arthroplasty, and recurrence of infection were analyzed. RESULTS The CN-PJI group showed a significantly higher incidence of prior antibiotic use ( p = 0.004) and lower serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level ( p = 0.001) than the CP-PJI group. Normalized time interval of CRP level in CN-PJI was shorter than that of CP-PJI group. The mean interval time for two-stage exchange arthroplasty was also significantly lower ( p = 0.049) in the CN-PJI group than the CP-PJI group. There was no case of treatment failure or major complication in CN-PJI group. CONCLUSION The CN-PJI group after total hip arthroplasty could be treated successfully by two-stage exchange arthroplasty without any complications. Clinical course and prognosis of CN-PJI group was also better compared with that of CP-PJI group. Therefore, culture negativity of PJI cannot be always a poor prognostic factor for the treatment.","Kang, Joon-Soon; Shin, Eun-Ho; Roh, Tae-Hoon; Na, Yeop; Moon, Kyoung Ho; Park, Joo-Hyun",Journal of orthopaedic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/2309499017754095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29366392/,251

88830,Editorial: A Decline in Influenza During the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Emergence of Potential Epidemic and Pandemic Influenza Viruses.,2021-10-04,"OBJECTIVES To examine changes in Social Media (SoMe) use among urology residency applicants before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We distributed surveys to individuals who applied to our residency program for application cycles ending in 2018, 2019, and 2021. The surveys included questions about applicants' SoMe use and perceptions of programs' SoMe use during the application process, both before (2018/2019) and after (2021) the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was SoMe use for professional purposes. RESULTS We received survey responses from 33% (162/496) and 29% (84/294) of applicants from the 2018/2019 and 2021 cohorts, respectively. There was a significant increase in professional SoMe use in the 2021 cohort (80%) compared with the 2018/2019 cohort (44%) (p<0.001). In 2021 compared to 2018/2019, more applicants used SoMe to connect directly with residents (69% vs 34%, p<0.001) and with faculty members (65% vs 15%, p<0.001). Applicants in 2021 compared to 2018/2019 more often found SoMe to be useful for making decisions about applying to (33% vs 10%), interviewing at (26% vs 7%), and ranking programs (20% vs 9%) (all p<0.05). Twitter was the most common platform for applicants to access program information, increasing from 38% to 71%. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a period of unprecedented SoMe usage among urology applicants, who used it to learn about and connect with residency programs in new ways. The use of SoMe by residency programs has become an important component of trainee recruitment and is likely to continue in the future.","Ho, Patrick; Margolin, Ezra; Sebesta, Elisabeth; Small, Alexander; Badalato, Gina M",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2021.05.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34033828/,251
88838,"COVID-19 Impacts, Diagnosis and Possible Therapeutic Techniques: A Comprehensive Review.",2020-12-04,"A 52-year-old woman after renal transplantation developed unilateral pleural effusion as well as a massive edema of the upper limb, breast, and face as a complication of the subclavian vein catheterization and arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis. We revealed that impaired venous drainage due to extensive vein occlusion after temporary catheter insertion, together with high venous flow from the arteriovenous fistula, were the explanation. Because of moderately impaired renal graft function and limited availability of vascular access in the patient, fistula ligation as a therapeutic method described in literature, was not an option in our case. The patient underwent an unsuccessful attempt of venous angioplasty, and eventually banding of the fistula and blood flow reduction resolved pleural effusions and edema. This is a reasonable approach to the problem of massive upper torso edema due to central vein occlusion with ipsilateral arteriovenous fistula.","Banasik, Mirosław; Dawiskiba, Tomasz; Letachowicz, Krzysztof; Zmonarski, Sławomir; Mazanowska, Oktawia; Lipiak, Edyta; Miś, Marcin; Janczak, Dariusz; Krajewska, Magdalena",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.1177/1129729820961959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985359/,251
88856,Prognostic factors in the progression of intervertebral disc degeneration: Which patient should be targeted with regenerative therapies?,2019,"BACKGROUND Debilitating brain injury occurs in 1.6-5 % of patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging studies have reported stroke-like lesions in up to 51 % of patients after cardiac surgery. The majority of the lesions seem to be caused by emboli, but inadequate blood flow caused by other mechanisms may increase ischaemia in the penumbra or cause watershed infarcts. During cardiopulmonary bypass, blood pressure can be below the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation. Although much debated, the constant blood flow provided by the cardiopulmonary bypass system is still considered by many as appropriate to avoid cerebral ischaemia despite the low blood pressure. METHODS/DESIGN The Perfusion Pressure Cerebral Infarct trial is a single-centre superiority trial with a blinded outcome assessment. The trial is randomising 210 patients with coronary vessel and/or valve disease and who are undergoing cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients are stratified by age and surgical procedure and are randomised 1:1 to either an increased mean arterial pressure (70-80 mmHg) or 'usual practice' (40-50 mmHg) during cardiopulmonary bypass. The cardiopulmonary bypass pump flow is fixed and set at 2.4 L/minute/m(2) body surface area plus 10-20 % in both groups. The primary outcome measure is the volume of the new ischaemic cerebral lesions (in mL), expressed as the difference between a baseline, diffusion-weighted, magnetic resonance imaging scan and an equal scan conducted 3-6 days postoperatively. Secondary endpoints are the total number of new ischaemic cerebral lesions, postoperative cognitive dysfunction at discharge and 3 months postoperatively, diffuse cerebral injury evaluated by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and selected biochemical markers of cerebral injury. The sample size will enable us to detect a 50 % reduction in the primary outcome measure in the intervention compared to the control group at a significance level of 0.05 and with a power of 0.80. DISCUSSION This is the first clinical randomised study to evaluate whether the mean arterial pressure level during cardiopulmonary bypass influences the development of brain injuries that are detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.

89536,Top 10 Things Every Radiologist Needs to Know About Intimate Partner Violence.,2020-09-22,"OBJECTIVES The outbreak of COVID-19 affects both physical and mental health of pregnant women. This study focuses on their psychological status, and analyzes the main factors affecting their emotions of pregnant women so as to provide guidance for psychological counseling and social intervention during epidemics. METHODS Multiple researchers distributed a questionnaire online via the Internet. Pregnant women volunteered, and the questionnaire was automatically collected in the background. RESULTS The 298 valid questionnaires recovered showed that 82 cases of pregnant women were in states of anxiety, accounting for 27.51%, of which 78.05% were mild (82 cases), 19.51% were moderate (16 cases), and 2.44% were severe (2 cases). Moreover, 31.21% of pregnant women were in states of depression (93 cases), of which 52.69% were mild (49 cases), 40.86% were moderate (38 cases), and 6.45% were severe (6 cases). The risk factors for states of anxiety or depression were fear of fetal malformation or genetic disease, history of adverse pregnancy, can't do routine prenatal examination, and insufficient support and care from husbands and families. Besides, 16 cases had sought psychological help during the epidemic, among whom 62.50% (10 cases) experienced anxiety, 68.75% (11 cases) had depression. CONCLUSIONS During the outbreak of COVID-19, obstetricians may take use of the Internet, based on the advantages in epidemic prevention, controlling health education, and popularizing science. In addition, husbands and family members should provide greater care for pregnant women, to protect their mental health during public health incidents.","Cao, Yuming; Liu, Juan; Zhang, Yuanzhen; Li, Yating; Chen, Zhenlie; Lu, Jing",Journal of perinatal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2020-0541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33866693/,251
89600,Use of a cyanoacrylate skin adhesive to reduce external ventricular drain infection rates.,2014,"Importance As the resolution of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis is unforeseeable, and/or a second wave of infections may arrive in the fall of 2020, it is important to evaluate patients' perspectives to learn from this. Objective To assess how Dutch patients with cancer perceive cancer treatment and follow-up care (including experiences with telephone and video consultations [TC/VC]) and patients' well-being in comparison with a norm population during the COVID-19 crisis. Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional study of patients participating in the Dutch Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial Treatment and Long-term Evaluation of Survivorship (PROFILES) registry and a norm population who completed a questionnaire from April to May 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Logistic regression analysis assessed factors associated with changes in cancer care (treatment or follow-up appointment postponed/canceled or changed to TC/VC). Differences in quality of life, anxiety/depression, and loneliness between patients and age-matched and sex-matched norm participants were evaluated with regression models. Results The online questionnaire was completed by 4094 patients (48.6% response), of whom most were male (2493 [60.9%]) and had a mean (SD) age of 63.0 (11.1) years. Of these respondents, 886 (21.7%) patients received treatment; 2725 (55.6%) received follow-up care. Treatment or follow-up appointments were canceled for 390 (10.8%) patients, whereas 160 of 886 (18.1%) in treatment and 234 of 2725 (8.6%) in follow-up had it replaced by a TC/VC. Systemic therapy, active surveillance, or surgery were associated with cancellation of treatment or follow-up appointment. Younger age, female sex, comorbidities, metastasized cancer, being worried about getting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and receiving supportive care were associated with replacement of a consultation with a TC/VC. Patients and norm participants reported that the COVID-19 crisis made them contact their general practitioner (852 of 4068 [20.9%] and 218 of 979 [22.3%]) or medical specialist/nurse (585 of 4068 [14.4%] and 144 of 979 [14.7%]) less quickly when they had physical complaints or concerns. Most patients who had a TC/VC preferred a face-to-face consultation, but 151 of 394 (38.3%) were willing to use a TC/VC again. Patients with cancer were more worried about getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared with the 977 norm participants (917 of 4094 [22.4%] vs 175 of 977 [17.9%]). Quality of life, anxiety, and depression were comparable, but norm participants more often reported loneliness (114 of 977 [11.7%] vs 287 of 4094 [7.0%]) than patients with cancer (P = .009). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with cancer in the Netherlands, 1 in 3 reported changes in cancer care in the first weeks of the COVID-19 crisis. Long-term outcomes need to be monitored. The crisis may affect the mental well-being of the general population relatively more than that of patients with cancer.","van de Poll-Franse, Lonneke V; de Rooij, Belle H; Horevoorts, Nicole J E; May, Anne M; Vink, Geraldine R; Koopman, Miriam; van Laarhoven, Hanneke W M; Besselink, Marc G; Oerlemans, Simone; Husson, Olga; Beijer, Sandra; Ezendam, Nicole P M; Raijmakers, Natasja J H; Wollersheim, Barbara M; Hoedjes, Meeke; Siesling, Sabine; van Eenbergen, Mies C; Mols, Floortje",JAMA oncology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.6093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33237294/,251

This contrasts with viruses such as influenza where disease manifestations are often more severe in children1. We hypothesized that a more robust early innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may protect against severe disease and compared clinical outcomes, viral copies and cellular gene and protein expression in nasopharyngeal swabs from 12 children and 27 adults upon presentation to the Emergency Department. SARS-CoV-2 copies were similar, but compared to adults, children displayed higher expression of genes associated with interferon signaling, NLRP3 inflammasome, and other innate pathways. Higher levels of IFN-alpha2, IFN-gamma, IP-10, IL-8, and IL-1beta were detected in nasal fluid in children versus adults. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG were detected in nasal fluid from both groups and correlated negatively with mucosal IL-18. These findings suggest that a more robust innate immune response in children compared to adults contributes to favorable clinical outcomes.","Pierce, Carl A; Sy, Sharlene; Galen, Benjamin; Goldstein, Doctor Y; Orner, Erika; Keller, Marla; Herold, Kevan C; Herold, Betsy",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.12.21251310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594377/,251

METHODS Eighty-one consecutive TLDG procedures were performed by a single surgeon and subsequently examined. Postoperative outcomes, clinicopathologic features, and postoperative endoscopic findings between the 2 groups were evaluated and compared. RESULTS The mean operation time was not significantly higher in the R-Y than in the B-II group (P=0.396). Postoperative hospital stay was longer in the R-Y than in the B-II group (P=0.037). The severities of gastritis and bile reflux were reduced significantly in the R-Y group as compared with that in the B-II group (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the amount of residual food between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS R-Y reconstruction after TLDG appears to be a safe and feasible procedure, and is associated with a reduced severity of gastritis and bile reflux in the remnant stomach.","Shim, Jung Ho; Oh, Seong Il; Yoo, Han Mo; Jeon, Hae Myung; Park, Cho Hyun; Song, Kyo Young","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e31829014ea; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710243/,251

Unfortunately, the transmission routes and shedding kinetics of respiratory viruses remain poorly understood. Air sampling techniques to quantify infectious viruses in the air are indispensable to improve intervention strategies to control and prevent spreading of respiratory viruses. Here, the collection of infectious virus with the six-stage Andersen cascade impactor was optimized with semi-solid gelatin as collection surface. Subsequently, the collection efficiency of the cascade impactor, the SKC BioSampler, and an in-house developed electrostatic precipitator was compared. In an in vitro set-up, influenza A virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus type 3, and respiratory syncytial virus were nebulized and the amount of collected infectious virus and viral RNA was quantified with each air sampler. Whereas only low amounts of virus were collected using the electrostatic precipitator, high amounts were collected with the BioSampler and cascade impactor. The BioSampler allowed straight-forward sampling in liquid medium, whereas the more laborious cascade impactor allowed size fractionation of virus-containing particles. Depending on the research question, either the BioSampler or the cascade impactor can be applied in laboratory and field settings, such as hospitals to gain more insight into the transmission routes of respiratory viruses.","Kutter, Jasmin S; de Meulder, Dennis; Bestebroer, Theo M; Mulders, Ard; Fouchier, Ron A M; Herfst, Sander",Indoor air,https://doi.org/10.1111/ina.12875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34124803/,251
90682,Etiology and Recovery of Neuromuscular Fatigue following Competitive Soccer Match-Play.,2017,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE Chest wall reconstruction in children is typically accomplished with either primary tissue repair or synthetic mesh prostheses. Primary tissue repair has been associated with high rates of scoliosis, whereas synthetic prostheses necessitate the placement of a permanent foreign body in growing children. This report describes the use of biologic mesh (Permacol; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) as an alternative to both tissue repair and synthetic prostheses in pediatric chest wall reconstruction. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed identifying patients undergoing chest wall reconstruction with biologic mesh at our tertiary referral children's hospital between 2007 and 2011. Data collection included patient demographics, indication for chest wall resection, number of ribs resected, the administration of postoperative radiation, length of follow-up, postoperative complications, and the degree of spinal angulation (preoperatively and at most recent follow-up). RESULTS Five patients (age, 9.0-21.7 years; mean, 15.4 years) underwent resection for primary chest wall malignancy followed by reconstruction with biologic mesh (Permacol) during the study period. There were no postoperative mesh-related complications, and none of the patients developed clinically significant scoliosis (follow-up, 1.1-2.6 years; mean 1.9 years). CONCLUSION Biologic mesh offers a safe and dependable alternative to both primary tissue repair and synthetic mesh in pediatric patients undergoing chest wall reconstruction.","Lin, Shawn R; Kastenberg, Zachary J; Bruzoni, Matias; Albanese, Craig T; Dutta, Sanjeev",Journal of pediatric surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2012.05.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22813819/,251

The aim of this study was to evaluate the consequences of COVID-19 on the IBD Unit's activity and provide information on restructuring with available resources. METHODS an observational study was performed in a referral hospital in Madrid (Spain). Type of appointment, loss of follow-up, hospital admission, treatment changes, endoscopic activity, surgeries and blood tests were evaluated between March 15th and May 15th, 2020. This data was compared with the usual activity a year before. RESULTS among the 510 patients included, 476 (93.33 %) received had a remote consultation, representing an increase of 92.38 % compared with the previous year (0.95 %). There was a loss of follow-up in 26 patients (5.1 %) vs 15 (3.58 %) the previous year. A total of 60 (35.09 %) blood tests, 64 (76.19 %) endoscopies and all scheduled surgeries were suspended. Besides, 484 (94.9 %) patients remained adherent vs 417/419 (99.5 %) in the pre-pandemic period and 48 (9.41 %) reported symptoms of an IBD flare. Thirty-nine (7.6 %) patients developed symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. CONCLUSION a large number of tests and on-site outpatient visit consultations were suspended. However, a rapid adaptation to telemedicine allowed these patients to be closely followed up. Although it was possible to maintain therapeutic compliance, with a loss to follow-up slightly higher than the previous year, suspensions and delays of tests could have significant negative consequences in the long term.","El Hajra, Ismael; Calvo, Marta; Santos Pérez, Elena; Blanco Rey, Santiago; González Partida, Irene; Matallana, Virginia; González-Lama, Yago; Vera, María Isbel",Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva,https://doi.org/10.17235/reed.2020.7543/2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33342217/,251

We report our experience based on routine patch use in MH repair to curb recurrence. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to study the recurrence and complications associated with minimally invasive surgery and the use of patch. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all cases of MH who underwent first-time repair in 2012-2017 in our institution to determine recurrence and complication rate. A MEDLINE search related to minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and patch repair of MH was conducted for systematic review. Eligible articles published from 1997-2017 with follow-up data available were included. Primary outcomes measured were recurrence and complication. Meta-analysis to compare open versus MIS and primary versus patch repair in the MIS group were performed in comparative cohorts. Continuous data were presented as median (range), and statistical significance was P<0.05. RESULTS In our institution, 12 consecutive patients aged 17-month-old (22 days-7 years), underwent laparoscopic patch repair of MH, with one conversion to laparotomy. No recurrence or significant complication occurred over a follow-up period of 8 months (1-48 months). Thirty-six articles were included from literature review and were combined with the current series. All were retrospective case reports or series, of which 6 were comparative cohorts with both MIS and open repairs. A total of 296 patients from 37 series were ultimately used for analysis: 80 had open repair (4 patch) and 216 had MIS repair (32 patch), with a patch rate of 12%. There were 13 recurrences (4%): no difference between open and MIS repairs (4/80 vs 9/216, p=0.75); recurrence rate following primary repair was 13/260 (5%), but no recurrence occurred with 36 patch repairs. Meta-analysis showed no difference in recurrence between open and MIS repair (p=0.83), whereas patch repair was associated with 14% less recurrence compared with primary repair, although it did not reach statistical significance (p=0.12). There were 13 complications (5%): no difference between open and MIS repairs (5/80 vs 8/216, p=0.35). One small bowel obstruction occurred in a patient who had laparoscopic patch repair.

92566,Suspected propofol infusion syndrome during normal targeted propofol concentration.,2020-03-28,"Background: Improved breastfeeding practices have the potential to save the lives of over 823,000 children under 5 years old globally every year. Exclusively breastfeeding infants for the first six months would lead to the largest infant mortality reduction. The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is a global campaign by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), which promotes best practice to support breastfeeding in maternity services. The Baby-Friendly Community Initiative (BFCI) is an extension of the BHFI's 10 th step of the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding and of the BFHI overall. Its focus is on community-based breastfeeding supports for women. There have been no known attempts to synthesise the overall body of evidence on the BFHI in recent years, and no synthesis of empirical research on the BFCI. This scoping review asks the question: what is known about the implementation of the BFHI and the BFCI globally? Methods and analysis: This scoping review will be conducted according to the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. Inclusion criteria will follow the Population, Concepts, Contexts approach. A data charting form will be developed and applied to all the included studies. Qualitative and quantitative descriptive analysis will be undertaken. In order to address equity of access to the BFHI/BFCI, the Levesque et al. (2013) access to health care framework will be used as a lens to analyse the charted data in relation to this aspect of the review. An already established group of stakeholders with experience of infant feeding policy and implementation in Malawi will be consulted, to obtain expert views on the findings of the scoping review. Conclusion: This review will establish gaps in current evidence which will inform areas for future research in relation to this global initiative.","Walsh, Aisling; Pieterse, Pieternella; McCormack, Zoe; Chirwa, Ellen; Matthews, Anne",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13180.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34095749/,251

Combining experimental, numerical, and theoretical analysis, we present a comprehensive study of the transport of motile bacteria in shear flows. Experimentally, we obtain with high accuracy and, for a large range of flow rates, the spatially resolved velocity and orientation distributions. They are in excellent agreement with the simulations of a kinematic model accounting for stochastic and microhydrodynamic properties and, in particular, the flagella chirality. Theoretical analysis reveals the scaling laws behind the average rheotactic velocity at moderate shear rates using a chirality parameter and explains the reorientation dynamics leading to saturation at large shear rates from the marginal stability of a fixed point. Our findings constitute a full understanding of the physical mechanisms and relevant parameters of bacteria bulk rheotaxis.","Jing, Guangyin; Zöttl, Andreas; Clément, Éric; Lindner, Anke",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb2012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32695880/,251

There is currently no quantitative method for acoustic coupling verification in ultrasound-guided FUS. In this work, a quantitative method was developed and a related metric was introduced: the acoustic coupling coefficient. This metric associates the adequacy of the acoustic coupling with the reflected signals recorded through an imaging probe during a low-energy sonication. The acoustic coupling issue was simulated in silico and validated through in vitro tests. Our results indicated a sigmoidal behavior of the introduced metric as the contact surface between the coupling system and the patient's skin increases. The proposed method could be a safety-check criterion for verifying the adequacy of the acoustic coupling before starting the FUS treatment, thus ensuring efficient energy transmission to the target and preventing damage to both the patient and the instrumentation.","Morchi, Laura; Mariani, Andrea; Diodato, Alessandro; Tognarelli, Selene; Cafarelli, Andrea; Menciassi, Arianna",Ultrasound in medicine & biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2020.08.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004236/,251
93178,Inflammasomes and Pyroptosis as Therapeutic Targets for COVID-19.,2020-06-03,"AIM To evaluate the diagnostic worth of elevated serum ACE (sACE) and lymphopaenia, singly or combined, in diagnosing sarcoid uveitis. METHODS Monocentric retrospective study, on a cohort of 996 adult patients referred to our department between March 2001 and December 2018 for a diagnostic work-up of uveitis. The sensitivity (SE), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the two biomarkers were calculated in different contexts. RESULTS Eight hundred and sixty-eight patient cases were reviewed. The mean age at uveitis onset was 49.4 (±18.6) years. Of them, 144 patients had a diagnosis of sarcoid uveitis. An elevated sACE had SE of 45.8%, Sp of 88.8%, PPV of 44.9% and NPV of 89.2% in diagnosing sarcoid uveitis. For lymphopaenia, SE was 15.3%, Sp was 96.7%, PPV was 47.8% and NPV was 85.2%. For the combination of elevated sACE and lymphopaenia, SE was 18.9%, Sp was 99.0%, PPV was 73.9% and NPV was 89.5%. The value of this combination varied according to patient age at diagnosis plus anatomoclinical entities: for patients aged ≤50 years, SE was 31.3%, Sp was 99.7%, PPV was 90.9% and NPV was 94.3%. For granulomatous uveitis, SE was 26.2%, Sp was 97.3%, PPV was 73.3% and NPV was 82.5%. CONCLUSION A combination of elevated serum ACE and lymphopaenia more convincingly suggests sarcoid uveitis than these investigational tests used alone, especially in patients with granulomatous uveitis, while a lack of these markers corresponds to a high NPV.

No consensus exists on optimal surgical treatment, even if several techniques have been proposed. In this preliminary case-control study we compared excision by knife and diathermy to investigate if wound dehiscence could be related to heat spreading during excision of the sinus. Materials and method Between January 2017 and February 2018, 29 patients underwent to sinus excision.16 patients underwent sinus excision by diathermy (named ""Hot"" group, case-group) while 13 patients underwent excision by the knife as the control group (named ""Cold"" group). The temperature data were recorded for both groups. Were considered primary and secondary outcomes. Results the cold group has worse outcomes in operative time and blood loss, but better results in post-operative pain at first day and first control, number of weekly and total dressings until healing, time for full wound recovery, days to return to work, patient feeling feedback and scar aspect. Wounds healed within 8-12 days were 84.6% in the Cold group and 18.8% in the Hot one. I° Dindo-Clavien complications were respectively 15.4% and 100.0% for the Cold and Hot group. No differences were recorded for II° Dindo-Clavien complications and in days of hospitalization. Conclusion cold excision of the sinus pilonidalis has better results both in terms of precarious healing and quality of life, probably because the tissues are not subjected to diathermocoagulation damage and therefore the healing occurs more quickly.

METHODS Patients with spontaneous ICH at three German tertiary stroke centers were retrospectively included. Each CT scan was rated for four NCCT markers and SS on CTA by two radiology residents. Raters were blind to all demographic and outcome data. Inter- and intrarater agreement was determined by Cohen's kappa (κ) coefficient and percentage of agreement. RESULTS Interrater agreement was excellent in 473 included patients, ranging from 96% to 99%. Interrater κ ranged from 0.85 (95% CI [0.78-0.91]) to 0.97 (95% CI [0.94-0.99]) for NCCT markers and 0.93 (95% CI [0.88-0.98]) for SS, all p-values < 0.001.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective review of 77 patients with predominantly solid thyroid nodules treated with RFA in a single center between 2013 and 2016. All patients declined or were not eligible for surgery. Benign proven thyroid nodules causing compressive symptoms and cosmetic concerns were considered for treatment. Nodule volume, thyroid nodule related compressive symptoms, cosmetic concerns and thyroid function were evaluated. RESULTS All patients underwent a single treatment session. Mean nodule volume decreased from 17.9 ± 15.6 mL at baseline to 5.2 ± 7.4 after 12 months with a volume reduction ratio (VRR) of 70.9% ± 20.8%. There were no identifiable factors predictive of response to RFA. Median cosmetic and symptom scores of the entire population decreased from 3 [2-4] and 3 [0-10] to 1 [1-3] (p < 0.001) and 0 [0-5] (p < 0.001), respectively. No major complications occurred and RFA did not affect thyroid function when normal. CONCLUSION RFA induces substantial volume reduction of predominantly solid thyroid nodules and improves compressive symptoms and cosmetic concerns. RFA does not impact normal thyroid function and has an acceptable safety profile.","Rabuffi, Paolo; Spada, Antonio; Bosco, Daniela; Bruni, Antonio; Vagnarelli, Simone; Ambrogi, Cesare; Di Stasio, Enrico; Santonati, Assunta",Journal of ultrasound,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40477-019-00375-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30945239/,251

96333,Letter From the Executive Director Dr. John Cho.,2020-03-02,"BACKGROUND The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of ipsilateral opposite-side aspiration, a new method to overcome resistant pneumothorax after failure of a simple aspiration. The patient position is reversed (from prone to supine or vice versa) and the aspiration repeated. METHODS Between January 1, 2010, and April 3, 2012, 129 consecutive, CT image-guided, percutaneous needle biopsies of lung nodules were performed in 127 patients (75 men, 52 women; mean age, 67.8 years; range, 26-88 years). Two patients underwent repeated biopsies. The mean lesion diameter was 38 mm (range, 8-110 mm). Core biopsy and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) were performed in 126 procedures; in three cases, only FNA was performed. In the cases with symptomatic minimal pneumothorax and in all patients with pneumothorax > 10 mm, immediate, simple, manual aspiration was performed. Ipsilateral opposite-side aspiration was performed when simple aspiration failed. RESULTS Among 129 CT image-guided biopsies, pneumothorax was detected by CT scan in 54 (42%); 51 (39%) were detected during the biopsy. Delayed pneumothorax occurred in two patients (1.55%). Manual aspiration to treat pneumothorax was performed in 27 of 129 procedures (21%). Simple aspiration was successful in 20 of these 27 cases (74%). Ipsilateral opposite-side aspiration was accomplished in the remaining seven cases (26%) and was successful in six cases (86%). Two of 129 procedures (1.55%) required chest tube placement. CONCLUSIONS Immediate, simple, percutaneous aspiration of iatrogenic pneumothorax was successful in 74% of patients needing treatment. Our proposed new method of ipsilateral opposite-side aspiration offers a solution for patients who remain with resistant pneumothorax after simple aspiration.","Yaffe, Daniel; Shitrit, David; Gottfried, Maya; Bartal, Gabriel; Sosna, Jacob",Chest,https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.12-2790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23681216/,251
96590,The role of opioid receptor agonists in ischemic preconditioning.,2013,"INTRODUCTION The effect of renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) on neurohormonal responses is largely unknown. We aimed to assess the effect of RDN on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and endogenous catecholamines. METHODS A total of 60 patients with hypertension underwent RDN and remained on a stable antihypertensive drug regimen. Samples for plasma aldosterone, plasma renin and urine (nor)metanephrine were collected at baseline and at 6 months post procedure. Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) recordings were obtained at baseline and at 6 months post procedure. RESULTS Mean age was 64±9 years, and 30/60 patients were male. At 6 months, average daytime systolic and diastolic ambulatory BP decreased by 10 and 6 mmHg, respectively (p<0.001). No significant change was observed in plasma aldosterone (median=248.0 pmol/L (interquartile range (IQR) 113.3-369.5 pmol/L) vs. median=233.0 pmol/L (IQR 110.3-360.8 pmol/L); p=0.66); renin (median=19.5 µIU/mL (IQR 6.8-119.5 µIU/mL) vs. median=14.3 µIU/mL (IQR 7.2-58.0 µIU/mL); p=0.32), urine metanephrine (median=0.46 µmol/L (IQR 0.24-0.77 µmol/L) vs. median=0.46 µmol/L (IQR 0.22-0.88 µmol/L); p=0.75) and normetanephrine (median=1.41 µmol/L (IQR 0.93-2.00 µmol/L vs. median =1.56 (IQR 0.74-2.50 µmol/L); p=0.58) between baseline and 6 months, respectively. No correlation was found between the decrease in mean systolic daytime BP and changes in RAAS hormones or endogenous catecholamines. CONCLUSION Despite significant reductions in ambulatory BP, RDN did not result in a significant change in endogenous catecholamines or in RAAS hormones at 6 months.","Feyz, Lida; van den Berg, Sjoerd; Zietse, Robert; Kardys, Isabella; Versmissen, Jorie; Daemen, Joost",Journal of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system : JRAAS,https://doi.org/10.1177/1470320320943095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32862760/,251

AIM The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility and the technique of HALDoN. METHOD We analyzed 72 donors who underwent HALDoN from February 2008-August 2011. RESULTS Including 8/72 donors who underwent right nephrectomy, all subjects completed HALDoN without conversion to an open procedure. None of the recipients suffered delayed graft function or an ureteric problem. Knife-to-removal time (KRT) was longer among cases with graft weight (GW) >200 g than GW ≤200 g: 176.5 ± 35.1 minutes vs 142 ± 18.7 minutes (P < .001). Longer KRT (>180 minutes) and right nephrectomy produced longer reperfusion-to-urine secretion time (RUT; P = .002 and P = .027, respectively). Grafts with double renal arteries (N = 10) also tended to show longer RUT (P = .058). In a case with an early renal arterial branch <1 cm from the aorta, we transected the vessel to achieve a single orifice of the artery using a stapling device. At 6 months the average value of decreased renal function of donors had recovered to about 70%. The incidence of complication was 8.3% but there was no life-threatening morbidity. CONCLUSION The hand-assisted method could make the operating surgeon more confident to perform laparoscopic donor nephrectomy safely. HALDoN offers particular advantages for precise dissection using finger retraction and control of potential bleeding in the stages of vascular stapling and graft removal, preserving graft viability.","Marui, Y; Nakamura, M; Tanaka, K; Tomikawa, S",Transplantation proceedings,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2011.12.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22310569/,251

This is the first report of Italian Society for Cardiac Surgery (SICCH) on preliminary experience with COVID-19 patients receiving ECMO support. Data from 12 Italian hospitals participating in SICCH were retrospectively analyzed. Between March 1st and September 15th, 2020, a veno-venous (VV) ECMO system was installed in 67 patients (94%) and a veno-arterio-venous (VAV) ECMO in four (6%). Five patients required VA ECMO after initial weaning from VV ECMO. Thirty (42.2%) patients were weaned from ECMO, while 39 (54.9%) died on ECMO, and six (8.5%) died after ECMO removal. Overall hospital survival was 36.6% (n=26). Main causes of death were multiple organ failure (n=14, 31.1%) and sepsis (n=11, 24.4%). On multivariable analysis, predictors of death while on ECMO support were older age (p=0.048), elevated pre-ECMO C-reactive protein level (p=0.048), higher positive end-expiratory pressure on ventilator (p=0.036) and lower lung compliance (p=0.032). If the conservative treatment is not effective, ECMO support might be considered as life-saving rescue therapy for COVID-19 refractory respiratory failure.

97962,Influence of patient factors on the efficacy of breathing system filters at preventing contamination of breathing systems.,2010,"BACKGROUND The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends that women who carry gene variants that confer substantial risk for breast cancer consider risk-reduction strategies, that is, enhanced surveillance (breast magnetic resonance imaging and mammography) or prophylactic surgery. Pathogenic variants can be detected in women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer syndromes by multigene panel testing. OBJECTIVES To investigate whether using a seven-gene test to identify women who should consider risk-reduction strategies could cost-effectively increase life expectancy. METHODS We estimated effectiveness and lifetime costs from a payer perspective for two strategies in two hypothetical cohorts of women (40-year-old and 50-year-old cohorts) who meet the National Comprehensive Cancer Network-defined family history criteria for multigene testing. The two strategies were the usual test strategy for variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and the seven-gene test strategy for variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, PTEN, CDH1, STK11, and PALB2. Women found to have a pathogenic variant were assumed to undergo either prophylactic surgery or enhanced surveillance. RESULTS The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the seven-gene test strategy compared with the BRCA1/2 test strategy was $42,067 per life-year gained or $69,920 per quality-adjusted life-year gained for the 50-year-old cohort and $23,734 per life-year gained or $48,328 per quality-adjusted life-year gained for the 40-year-old cohort.

In space, the human brain undergoes functional and structural changes related to fluid shift and intracranial pressure. Behavioral abnormalities, such as cognitive deficits, sleep disruption, and visuomotor difficulties, as well as psychological effects, are also a concern. We discuss opportunities and challenges of noninvasive brain stimulation (NiBS) methods - including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) - to support space exploration in several ways. NiBS includes safe and portable techniques already applied in a wide range of cognitive and motor domains, as well as therapeutically. NiBS could be used to enhance in-flight performance, supporting astronauts during pre-flight Earth-based training, as well as to identify biomarkers of post-flight brain changes for optimization of rehabilitation/compensatory strategies. We review these NiBS techniques and their effects on brain physiology, psychology, and cognition.","Romanella, S; Sprugnoli, G; Ruffini, G; Seyedmadani, K; Rossi, S; Santarnecchi, E",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.09.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937115/,251

Whilst the boundaries of what can be achieved by advanced endoscopy are continually expanding, we believe that one of the most fundamental steps to achieving our goal is to raise the quality of everyday endoscopy. The development of robust, consensus- and evidence-based key performance measures is the first step in this vision. ESGE and UEG have identified quality of endoscopy as a major priority. This paper explains the rationale behind the ESGE Quality Improvement Initiative and describes the processes that were followed. We recommend that all units develop mechanisms for audit and feedback of endoscopist and service performance using the ESGE performance measures that will be published in future issues of this journal over the next year. We urge all endoscopists and endoscopy services to prioritize quality and to ensure that these performance measures are implemented and monitored at a local level, so that we can provide the highest possible care for our patients.","Rutter, Matthew D; Senore, Carlo; Bisschops, Raf; Domagk, Dirk; Valori, Roland; Kaminski, Michal F; Spada, Cristiano; Bretthauer, Michael; Bennett, Cathy; Bellisario, Cristina; Minozzi, Silvia; Hassan, Cesare; Rees, Colin; Dinis-Ribeiro, Mário; Hucl, Tomas; Ponchon, Thierry; Aabakken, Lars; Fockens, Paul",United European gastroenterology journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2050640615624631; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26966520/,251

This study aimed at investigating the impact of IFNL4 on acute HCV genotype 2 or 3 infections, and whether ITPase activity influenced outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two hundred and seven people who injected drugs (PWID) with documented anti-HCV seroconversion, and 57 PWID with reinfection with HCV were analyzed regarding IFNL4 (rs368234815 and rs12979860) and ITPA (rs1127354 and rs7270101), and longitudinally followed regarding HCV RNA. RESULTS The spontaneous clearance of HCV infection in anti-HCV seronegative PWID was enhanced when IFN-λ4 was absent (44% vs. 20% for IFNL4 TT/TTrs1368234815 and ΔGrs1368234815 respectively, p < .001; OR 3.2) across genotypes 1-3. The proportion lacking IFN-λ4 was further increased following resolution of repeated re-exposure to HCV (74% among re-infected participants who had cleared at least two documented HCV infections). ITPA genetic variants did not independently impact on the outcome, but among males lacking IFN-λ4, reduced ITPase activity markedly augmented the likelihood of resolution (65% vs. 29% for <100% and 100% ITPase activity, p = .006). CONCLUSIONS Absence of IFN-λ4 entails an enhanced likelihood of spontaneous resolution both following primary acute infection and repeated re-exposure to HCV across genotypes 1-3. Among men lacking IFN-λ4, reduced ITPase activity improved outcome.","Waldenström, Jesper; Kåberg, Martin; Alanko Blomé, Marianne; Widell, Anders; Björkman, Per; Nilsson, Staffan; Hammarberg, Anders; Weiland, Ola; Nyström, Kristina; Lagging, Martin",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1080/00365521.2021.1925956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34034600/,251

In advanced cancer stages (metastatic disease and/or vascular invasion), the generally accepted standard of care is systemic therapy using sorafenib as first-line treatment and, recently, regorafenib and nivolumab as second-line treatment, but the quality of life and the prognosis of patients remain very poor. Our paper reports a case of US-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of both intraparenchymal HCC and inferior vena cava tumor thrombus. METHODS We treated a patient with HCC associated with tumor thrombus extending into vena cava after failure of sorafenib therapy using US-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA). RESULTS A good radiological and clinical response was observed in association with excellent tolerability. The patient has been followed up for 15 months from the ablation, is alive, and is in a good clinical condition without evidence of tumor recurrence. CONCLUSION This is the first case in which this minimally invasive percutaneous procedure has been successfully used to treat an HCC thrombus entering the vena cava.","Gatti, Pietro; Giorgio, Antonio; Ciracì, Emanuela; Roberto, Italia; Anglani, Alessandro; Sergio, Spano; Rizzello, Fernando; Giorgio, Valentina; Semeraro, Stefano",Journal of ultrasound,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40477-019-00361-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30864004/,251

99972,Association between in vitro fertilization and ischemic placental disease by gestational age.,2020-07-21,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious and life threatening disease, with a fatality rate of almost 10%. The etiologic agent is a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), with animal reservoirs found in bats and other wild animals and thus the possibility of reemergence. In this study, we first investigated at 6 years postinfection whether SARS-specific memory T cells persist in SARS-recovered individuals, demonstrating that these subjects still possess polyfunctional SARS-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. A dominant memory CD8+ T cell response against SARS-CoV nucleocaspid protein (NP; amino acids 216 to 225) was then defined in SARS-recovered individuals carrying HLA-B*40:01, a HLA-B molecule present in approximately one-quarter of subjects of Asian ethnicities. To reconstitute such a CD8+ T cell response, we isolated the alpha and beta T cell receptors of the HLA-B*40:01-restricted SARS-specific CD8+ T cells. Using T cell receptor gene transfer, we generated SARS-specific redirected T cells from the lymphocytes of normal individuals. These engineered CD8+ T cells displayed avidity and functionality similar to that of natural SARS-specific memory CD8+ T cells. They were able to degranulate and produce gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and macrophage inflammatory proteins 1α and 1β after antigenic stimulation. Since there is no effective treatment against SARS, these transduced T cells specific for an immunodominant SARS epitope may provide a new avenue for treatment during a SARS outbreak.","Oh, Hsueh-Ling Janice; Chia, Adeline; Chang, Cynthia Xin Lei; Leong, Hoe Nam; Ling, Khoon Lin; Grotenbreg, Gijsbert M; Gehring, Adam J; Tan, Yee Joo; Bertoletti, Antonio",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.05039-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21813600/,251

We investigated the ability of five Food and Drug Administration-approved nonocclusive chest seals (CSs) to seal a bleeding chest wound and prevent tension hemopneumothorax (HPTX) in a swine model. METHODS Following instrumentation, an open chest wound was created in the left thorax of spontaneously air-breathing anesthetized pigs (n = 26; 43 kg). Autologous fresh blood (226 mL) was then infused into the pleural cavity to produce HPTX. The chest wounds were then sealed with CSs. The sealant strength and venting function of CSs were challenged by infusion of 50 mL more blood directly into the chest wound and incremental air injections into the pleural cavity. Tension HPTX was defined as intrapleural (IP) pressure equal to or more than +1 mm Hg and more than 20% deviation in physiologic measurements. RESULTS An open chest wound with HPTX raised IP pressure (~ -0.7 mm Hg) and caused labored breathing and reductions in PaO2 and SvO2 (p < 0.01). Sealing the wounds with the CSs restored IP pressure, and improved breathing and oxygenation. Subsequent blood infusion into the wound and IP air injections produced CS-dependent responses. Chest seals with one-way valves (Bolin and SAM) did not evacuate the blood efficiently; pooled blood either detached the CSs from skin and leaked out (75%), or clotted and clogged the valve and led to tension HPTX (25%). Conversely, CSs with laminar venting channels allowed escape of blood and air from the pleural cavity and maintained IP pressure and oxygenation near normal levels. Success rates were 100% for Sentinel and Russell (6/6); 67% for HyFin (4/6); 25% for SAM (1/4); and 0% for Bolin (0/4) CSs (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION The sealant and valve function of vented CS differed widely in the presence of bleeding chest wounds. Medics should be equipped with more effective CSs for treating HPTX in the field.","Kheirabadi, Bijan Shams; Terrazas, Irasema B; Miranda, Nahir; Voelker, Amber N; Arnaud, Francoise; Klemcke, Harold G; Butler, Frank K; Dubick, Michael A",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/ta.0000000000001501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28422911/,251

Using infection of mice with vesicular stomatitis virus, we analyzed how the innate immune system inhibits viral propagation but still allows the presentation of antigen to cells of the adaptive immune response. We found that expression of the gene encoding the inhibitory protein Usp18 in metallophilic macrophages led to lower type I interferon responsiveness, thereby allowing locally restricted replication of virus. This was essential for the induction of adaptive antiviral immune responses and, therefore, for preventing the fatal outcome of infection. In conclusion, we found that enforced viral replication in marginal zone macrophages was an immunological mechanism that ensured the production of sufficient antigen for effective activation of the adaptive immune response.","Honke, Nadine; Shaabani, Namir; Cadeddu, Giuseppe; Sorg, Ursula R; Zhang, Dong-Er; Trilling, Mirko; Klingel, Karin; Sauter, Martina; Kandolf, Reinhard; Gailus, Nicole; van Rooijen, Nico; Burkart, Christoph; Baldus, Stephan E; Grusdat, Melanie; Löhning, Max; Hengel, Hartmut; Pfeffer, Klaus; Tanaka, Masato; Häussinger, Dieter; Recher, Mike; Lang, Philipp A; Lang, Karl S",Nature immunology,https://doi.org/10.1038/ni.2169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22101728/,251

The characteristics of the pressurization ramp settings are not standardized across ventilators from different manufacturers. We performed a bench test of 5 models of ICU ventilators to examine the effects of pressurization ramp settings on the actual pressurization. METHODS A twin-bellows lung model was used, in which one bellow simulates inspiratory muscle activity and the other simulates an adult normal lung model. We made the inspiratory effort by changing the tidal volume of the inspiratory muscle bellow. The effect of pressurization ramp settings on the performance of each ventilator was examined at 3 inspiratory effort levels (ie, none, ordinary, and strong). The pressurization ramp was set at 4 or 5 evenly divided steps from the minimum to maximum for each ventilator. The following parameters were measured: tidal volume, mean airway pressure, maximal inspiratory flow, time to maximal flow, and pressure-time products at 0.3 s (PTP0.3) and 0.5 s (PTP0.5) from the beginning of inspiration. PTP0.3 and PTP0.5 indicated levels of inspiratory pressurization. RESULTS A proportional increase in PTP0.3 and PTP0.5 was observed with an increase in the pressurization ramp settings of the recent models of ventilators. PTP0.3 and PTP0.5 at ordinary and strong effort levels were similar in the recent models of ventilators. The actual adjustable ranges of PTP0.3 and PTP0.5 associated with change in the pressurization ramp settings differed between the 5 ventilators. CONCLUSIONS The adjustable ranges of the pressurization were largely different among the different types of ventilators. The actual absolute inspiratory pressurization during PC-CMV varied between the different ventilators even at similar pressurization ramp settings. Users should be mindful of the differences in the pressurization ramp settings.","Koyama, Yukiko; Uchiyama, Akinori; Yoshida, Junko; Yoshida, Takeshi; Yamashita, Tomonori; Fujino, Yuji",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.05286; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29765004/,251

This study aimed to shed light on physicians' knowledge of potential DDIs related to COVID-19 treatment, to determine the effect of an information brief about these DDIs on their correct response rates, and to identify factors associated with higher levels of knowledge about these DDIs. METHODS The knowledge of physicians regarding the clinical significance and intervention of 7 common potential DDIs during COVID-19 treatment was evaluated via an online survey. Using a pretest-posttest design, the physicians completed a multiple-choice questionnaire first using their existing knowledge, then received an information brief about the DDIs and completed the same questionnaire again. Pretest and posttest scores were evaluated and factors affecting correct response rates were determined using correlation, regression, and post-hoc analyses. RESULTS A total of 244 physicians participated in the survey, 147 (60.2%) of whom were involved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. After the information brief, there were significant increases in the number of correct responses for both clinical significance and interventions (p<0.0001). In comparisons of pretest knowledge, physicians involved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients showed significantly higher correct response rate for interventions compared to physicians who had not treated COVID-19 patients (p=0.003). Post-hoc analysis to compare pretest correct intervention responses among all medical specialties revealed significant differences between infectious diseases and family practice (mean difference: 1.059; p=0.005) and between internal medicine and family practice (mean difference: 1.771; p<0.0001). CONCLUSION Physicians involved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients had more knowledge regarding clinical significance and appropriate management of potential DDIs than those not involved. Therefore, it may be beneficial to organize trainings and issue guidelines about potential DDIs for physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sürmelioğlu, Nursel; Yalçın, Nadir; Kuşçu, Ferit; Candevir, Aslıhan; İnal, Ayşe Seza; Kömür, Süheyla; Kurtaran, Behice; Demirkan, Kutay; Taşova, Yeşim",Postgraduate medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2020.1807809; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32780961/,251

It is not known whether varicose veins predispose skin to poor wound healing. The expression pattern of gap junctional protein connexin, a known marker of poor wound healing, was investigated across various stages of venous disease. METHODS Patients undergoing intervention for varicose veins were assessed according to the Clinical Etiologic Anatomic Pathophysiologic (CEAP) classification of varicose veins. Paired 4-mm punch biopsies were taken from above the ankle (pathological) and above the knee (control). Tissues were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and for connexin 43, connexin 30 and connexin 26. RESULTS Forty-eight paired biopsies were taken (12 each for CEAP class C0, C2, C4 and C6). The pathological skin showed progressive epithelial hyperthickening, an increase in the number and depth of rete ridges, increased inflammation and loss of dermal architecture with disease progression from C4 onwards. The overall absolute connexin expression and mean connexin expression per cell in the pathological skin similarly increased across the CEAP classes from as early as C2. Increasing levels of connexin in control skin were also noted, indicating progression of the disease proximally. Connexin 43 expression showed the strongest positive correlation between pathological and control skin. CONCLUSION Connexins were overexpressed in patients with simple varicose veins, with a stepwise increased expression through venous eczema to ulceration. Connexin 43 is a potential biomarker for venous disease. This finding suggests that varicose veins predispose skin to poor wound healing. Surgical relevance The overexpression of connexins, a family of gap junctional proteins, is known to cause poor healing in venous leg ulceration. It is not known whether there is any association with superficial venous disease. Here, connexin proteins were overexpressed in patients with uncomplicated varicose veins, before histological skin changes. Connexin could be a biomarker of venous disease progression.","Kanapathy, M; Simpson, R; Madden, L; Thrasivoulou, C; Mosahebi, A; Becker, D L; Richards, T",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.10653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29143961/,251
101675,Error in Figure 2.,2018,"Longitudinal investigation of the neural correlates of reward processing in depression may represent an important step in defining effective biomarkers for antidepressant treatment outcome prediction, but the reliability of reward-related activation is not well understood. Thirty-seven healthy control participants were scanned using fMRI while performing a reward-related guessing task on two occasions, approximately one week apart. Two main contrasts were examined: right ventral striatum (VS) activation fMRI BOLD signal related to signed prediction errors (PE) and reward expectancy (RE). We also examined bilateral visual cortex activation coupled to outcome anticipation. Significant VS PE-related activity was observed at the first testing session, but at the second testing session, VS PE-related activation was significantly reduced. Conversely, significant VS RE-related activity was observed at time 2 but not time 1. Increases in VS RE-related activity from time 1 to time 2 were significantly associated with decreases in VS PE-related activity from time 1 to time 2 across participants. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) in VS were very low. By contrast, visual cortex activation had much larger ICCs, particularly in individuals with high quality data. Dynamic changes in brain activation are widely predicted, and failure to account for these changes could lead to inaccurate evaluations of the reliability of functional MRI signals. Conventional measures of reliability cannot distinguish between changes specified by algorithmic models of neural function and noisy signal. Here, we provide evidence for the former possibility: reward-related VS activations follow the pattern predicted by temporal difference models of reward learning but have low ICCs.","Chase, Henry W; Fournier, Jay C; Greenberg, Tsafrir; Almeida, Jorge R; Stiffler, Richelle; Zevallos, Carlos R; Aslam, Haris; Cooper, Crystal; Deckersbach, Thilo; Weyandt, Sarah; Adams, Phillip; Toups, Marisa; Carmody, Tom; Oquendo, Maria A; Peltier, Scott; Fava, Maurizio; McGrath, Patrick J; Weissman, Myrna; Parsey, Ramin; McInnis, Melvin G; Kurian, Benji; Trivedi, Madhukar H; Phillips, Mary L",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25961712/,251

The data of SARS in Guangzhou was derived from the technical files of Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention (GZCDC), including the statistical report and brief report of the epidemic situation (from January 2 to May 11, 2003);The data of COVID-19 in Wuhan was derived from the epidemic data published by Wuhan health and Health Committee's official website and other publicly reported documents (from December 9, 2019 to March 11, 2020). Descriptive analysis was used for a comparativeanalysis of the time and age characteristics, the number of cases, basic reproduction number (R0), proportion of medical staff in confirmed cases (%), crude mortality, etc. Results: A total of 1 072 cases of SARS in Guangzhou were included in the study. The incidence ratio of male to female was 1∶1.26. 43 cases of death were reported with a mortality rate of 4.01%. The median age was 36 years old. The proportion of medical staff in the early stage of the epidemic was 29.04% (88 cases). As to COVID-19 in Wuhan, a total of 49 978 cases were included, The incidence ratio of male to female was 1.04∶1. The 2 423 cases of death were reported with a mortality rate of 4.85%. The median age was 56 years old. The proportion of medical staff in the early stage of the epidemic was 30.43% (42 cases). Conclusion: The COVID-19 in Wuhan has the characteristics of high incidence and wide population. However, the epidemic situation is falling rapidly, and the prevention and control strategy needs to be adjusted timely. The prevention and control of nosocomial infection should be addressed in future.","Cai, W F; Yuan, J; Huang, L F; Chen, C; Ma, Y; Wang, H; Zhang, C H; Zhang, Z B; Li, T G; Wang, M",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20200312-00325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32842293/,251

CLF states that we should prioritise the needs of individuals who have had less opportunity to experience the events that characterise a complete life. Persad et al argue that their system is the product of a successful process of reflective equilibrium-a philosophical methodology whereby theories, principles and considered judgements are balanced with each other and revised until we achieve an acceptable coherence between our various beliefs. Yet I argue that many of the principles and intuitions underpinning CLF conflict with each other, and that Persad et al have failed to achieve an acceptable coherence between them. I focus on three tensions in particular: the conflict between the youngest first principle and Persad et al's investment refinement; the conflict between current medical need and a concern for lifetime equality; and the tension between adopting an objective measure of complete lives and accommodating for differences in life narratives.","Symons, Xavier",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33335068/,251
102294,Transforming Postgraduate Diagnostic Radiology Training in Canada With Competence-Based Medical Education.,2020-10-23,"OBJECT Neuroophthalmological morbidity is commonly associated with large and giant cavernous and supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms. The authors sought to evaluate the neuroophthalmological outcomes after treatment of these aneurysms with the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED). METHODS The Pipeline for Uncoilable or Failed Aneurysms (PUFS) trial was an international, multicenter prospective trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of the PED. All patients underwent complete neuroophthalmological examinations both before the PED procedure and at a 6-month follow-up. All examinations were performed for the purpose of this study and according to study criteria. RESULTS In total, 108 patients were treated in the PUFS trial, 98 of whom had complete neuroophthalmological follow-up. Of the patients with complete follow-up, 39 (40%) presented with a neuroophthalmological baseline deficit that was presumed to be attributable to the aneurysm, and patients with these baseline deficits had significantly larger aneurysms. In 25 of these patients (64%), the baseline deficit showed at least some improvement 6 months after PED treatment, whereas in 1 patient (2.6%), the deficits only worsened. In 5 patients (5%), new deficits had developed at the 6-month follow-up, while in another 6 patients (6%), deficits that were not originally assumed to be related to the aneurysm had improved by that time. A history of diabetes was associated with failure of the baseline deficits to improve after the treatment. The aneurysm maximum diameter was significantly larger in patients with a new deficit or a worse baseline deficit at 6 months postprocedure. CONCLUSIONS Patients treated with the PED for large and giant ICA aneurysms had excellent neuroophthalmological outcomes 6 months after the procedure, with deficits improving in most of the patients, very few deficits worsening, and few new deficits developing.","Sahlein, Daniel H; Fouladvand, Mohammad; Becske, Tibor; Saatci, Isil; McDougall, Cameron G; Szikora, István; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Moran, Christopher J; Woo, Henry H; Lopes, Demetrius K; Berez, Aaron L; Cher, Daniel J; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I; Albuquerque, Felipe C; Fiorella, David J; Berentei, Zsolt; Marosfoi, Miklos; Cekirge, Saruhan H; Kallmes, David F; Nelson, Peter K",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2014.12.jns141777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26162031/,251
102772,Hip Arthroscopy Successfully Treats Femoroacetabular Impingement in Adolescent Athletes.,2019,"ABSTRACT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. By mid-March, London had emerged as the epicenter in the United Kingdom, accounting for 45% of the COVID-19-related mortality. A cancer COVID-19-free ""cold hub,"" through National Health Service partnership with independent institutions, was established to maintain a throughput of surgical oncology patients with an accessible triage system for oncologic specialties. The high population density, commuter volume, and rising COVID-19 incidence heightened the challenge of segregating a vulnerable population that was already at high risk for surgical morbidity and mortality.The aim of this review is to report the experience of developing a multicenter COVID-19-free cold hub with the aim of providing safe surgery for surgical oncology patients. We discuss the timeline, structure, and infection control policy and suggest practical points that may guide other health care systems.The surgical oncology hub treated 1542 patients between March 1 and July 1, 2020. There were no cases of COVID-19-related mortality in a 30-day follow-up. Key strategies for the restructuring of the cancer service included the following: (1) formation of an accessible referral pathway, (2) creation and structuring of cold hub hospitals, (3) development of protocols for infection control and preoperative testing, (4) rapid reorganization of services based on initial feedback, and (5) clear communication and leadership.It has been shown that a surgical oncology cold hub with an accessible referral system and an effective system of preoperative screening system can minimize COVID-19 transmission, morbidity, and mortality, in a region with heavy disease prevalence. This structure represents a safe, ethical, and viable system that can be replicated in other health care systems.","Moriarty, Peter; Chang, Justin; Kayani, Babar; Roberts, Lois; Bourke, Neil; Dann, Christopher; MacArthur, Emma; Haddad, Fares S",Journal of patient safety,https://doi.org/10.1097/pts.0000000000000821; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33635842/,251

The aim of this initiative was to safely lower the rate of early births across the ACT and the surrounding areas in New South Wales. Modelled on the Western Australian PTB Prevention Initiative, the program included new clinical guidelines and a new PTB prevention clinic at the main tertiary hospital. AIM To evaluate the initiative and its effects on preterm and early term birth rates at the main tertiary hospital after 16 months of implementation. MATERIALS AND METHODS A before and after intervention study was conducted. Rates of preterm and early term birth before (previous five years) and after 16 months of implementation of the ACT PTB Prevention Initiative were evaluated. RESULTS At the main tertiary hospital in The Canberra Hospital, the rate of PTB was significantly reduced by 10% after 16 months of implementation of the initiative. Rates of PTB were lower than any of the preceding five years and resulted in 45 averted or delayed PTBs. The number of planned early term births with no medical indication was significantly reduced by 34.5% and resulted in 77 averted or delayed early term births. CONCLUSIONS The multifaceted PTB Prevention Initiative safely lowered the rates of early birth in the ACT context. These results highlight the importance of prioritising early birth prevention, education, research and expanding the initiative nationwide.","Orefice, Roberto; Smythe, Julia; Doherty, Dorota A; Lim, Boon",The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajo.13328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33759176/,251

However, abnormal cell metabolism is correlated with the occurrence of many diseases and is accompanied by changes in galectin (Gal) performance. Gals were found to be some of the master regulators of cell-cell interactions that reconstruct the microenvironment, and disordered expression of Gals is associated with multiple human metabolic-related diseases including cancer development. Cancer cells can interact with surrounding cells through Gals to create more suitable conditions that promote cancer cell aggressiveness. In this review, we organize the current understanding of Gals in a systematic way to dissect Gals' effect on human disease, including how Gals' dysregulated expression affects the tumor microenvironment's metabolism and elucidating the mechanisms involved in Gal-mediated diseases. This information may shed light on a more precise understanding of how Gals regulate cell biology and facilitate the development of more effective therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment by targeting the Gal family.","Li, Chien-Hsiu; Chang, Yu-Chan; Chan, Ming-Hsien; Yang, Yi-Fang; Liang, Shu-Mei; Hsiao, Michael",Biomedicines,https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9091159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34572346/,251

105558,Dermatology at a Glance: Koebner not forgotten!,2020-10-18,"Cognitive dysfunctions, including impaired attention, learning, memory, planning and problem solving, occur in depressive episodes, often persist during remission, predict relapse, worsen with recurrent episodes, and are not treated by current antidepressants or other medications. Cognitive symptoms are also present in other psychiatric disorders, are a hallmark of aging, and define several late-life disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. This pervasive occurrence suggests either a non-specific outcome of a diseased brain, or a shared underlying pathology contributing to this symptom dimension. Recent findings suggest a role for altered GABAergic inhibition in cognitive symptoms. Cellular, molecular and biochemical studies in human subjects report changes affecting the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) system, specifically somatostatin-expressing (SST+) GABAergic interneurons, across brain disorders and during aging. SST+ neurons gate excitatory input onto pyramidal neurons within cortical microcircuits. Experimentally reducing the function of these neurons affects excitatory signal-to-noise ratio, reduces synchronized cellular and neural activity, and leads to cognitive dysfunctions. Conversely, augmenting SST+ cell post-synaptic α5-GABA-A receptor activity has pro-cognitive efficacy in stress and aging models. Together, this suggests that reduced signaling of the SST+ neuron/α5-GABA-A receptor pathway contributes to cognitive dysfunctions, and that it represents a novel therapeutic target for remediating mood and cognitive symptoms in depression, other psychiatric disorders and during aging.","Prévot, Thomas; Sibille, Etienne",Molecular psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-0727-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346158/,251

106457,White paper on smokeless tobacco & women's health in India.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare mesenchymal tumors that are located specifically in the gastrointestinal tract, with up to 60% of occurrences in the stomach, 30% in the small intestine, and 10% in the esophagus, colon, and rectum. The annual incidence of GISTs is about 15 cases per million, which in the United States equals 5000 cases per year. In most cases, these tumors are asymptomatic and are found incidentally on computed tomography scan or by endoscopy. Preoperative evaluation is based on location, size, and anatomic features and helps to confirm the diagnosis of the GIST and assess outcomes. Surgical intervention is the gold standard for treatment of nonmetastatic GISTs. CASE PRESENTATION We report the case of an 80-year-old man with a gastric mass on the posterior surface of the greater curvature of the stomach at the junction of the gastric antrum and the pylorus, found incidentally on a computed tomography scan. The patient underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy and a single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. After histologic evaluation, the resected lesion was determined to be a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. CONCLUSION A single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for the resection of GISTs is a feasible and appropriate method if the lesion is a safe distance from the pylorus and the gastroesophageal junction for gross negative margins to be obtained. Its advantages include decreased pain and a shorter hospital stay compared with other methods.","Ong, Evan; Abrams, Andrew I; Lee, Elizabeth; Jones, Carol",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680813x13693422522033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24018090/,251
106510,Optimal perfusion computed tomographic thresholds for ischemic core and penumbra are not time dependent in the clinically relevant time window.,2014,"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease discovered in 2019 and currently in outbreak across the world. Lung injury with severe respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there still lacks efficient treatment for COVID-19 induced lung injury and acute respiratory failure. Methods: Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) caused by the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the most plausible mechanism of lung injury in COVID-19. We performed drug repositioning analysis to identify drug candidates that reverse gene expression pattern in L1000 lung cell line HCC515 treated with ACE2 inhibitor. We confirmed these drug candidates by similar bioinformatics analysis using lung tissues from patients deceased from COVID-19. We further investigated deregulated genes and pathways related to lung injury, as well as the gene-pathway-drug candidate relationships. Results: We propose two candidate drugs, COL-3 (a chemically modified tetracycline) and CGP-60474 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), for treating lung injuries in COVID-19. Further bioinformatics analysis shows that 12 significantly enriched pathways (P-value <0.05) overlap between HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and human COVID-19 patient lung tissues. These include signaling pathways known to be associated with lung injury such as TNF signaling, MAPK signaling and chemokine signaling pathways. All 12 pathways are targeted in COL-3 treated HCC515 cells, in which genes such as RHOA, RAC2, FAS, CDC42 have reduced expression. CGP-60474 shares 11 of 12 pathways with COL-3 and common target genes such as RHOA. It also uniquely targets other genes related to lung injury, such as CALR and MMP14. Conclusions: This study shows that ACE2 inhibition is likely part of the mechanisms leading to lung injury in COVID-19, and that compounds such as COL-3 and CGP-60474 have potential as repurposed drugs for its treatment.","He, Bing; Garmire, Lana",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.23996.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32934806/,251
106552,Effect of Intraocular Pressure on Aerosol Density Generated by Noncontact Tonometer Measurement.,2020-09-15,"BACKGROUND Provision of optimal postoperative analgesia should facilitate postoperative ambulation and rehabilitation. An optimal multimodal analgesia technique would include the use of nonopioid analgesics, including local/regional analgesic techniques such as surgical site local anesthetic infiltration. This article presents a novel approach to surgical site infiltration techniques for abdominal surgery based upon neuroanatomy. METHODS Literature searches were conducted for studies reporting the neuroanatomical sources of pain after abdominal surgery. Also, studies identified by preceding search were reviewed for relevant publications and manually retrieved. RESULTS Based on neuroanatomy, an optimal surgical site infiltration technique would consist of systematic, extensive, meticulous administration of local anesthetic into the peritoneum (or preperitoneum), subfascial, and subdermal tissue planes. The volume of local anesthetic would depend on the size of the incision such that 1 to 1.5 mL is injected every 1 to 2 cm of surgical incision per layer. It is best to infiltrate with a 22-gauge, 1.5-inch needle. The needle is inserted approximately 0.5 to 1 cm into the tissue plane, and local anesthetic solution is injected while slowly withdrawing the needle, which should reduce the risk of intravascular injection. CONCLUSIONS Meticulous, systematic, and extensive surgical site local anesthetic infiltration in the various tissue planes including the peritoneal, musculofascial, and subdermal tissues, where pain foci originate, provides excellent postoperative pain relief. This approach should be combined with use of other nonopioid analgesics with opioids reserved for rescue. Further well-designed studies are necessary to assess the analgesic efficacy of the proposed infiltration technique.","Joshi, Girish P; Janis, Jeffrey E; Haas, Eric M; Ramshaw, Bruce J; Nihira, Mikio A; Dunkin, Brian J",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

AIM To describe the volume of frequent paediatric attendance in England and the demographics of frequent paediatric ED users in English hospitals. METHOD We analysed the Hospital Episode Statistics dataset for April 2014-March 2017. The study included 2 308 816 children under 16 years old who attended an ED at least once. Children who attended four times or more in 2015/2016 were classified as frequent users. The preceding and subsequent years were used to capture attendances bordering with the current year. We used a mixed effects logistic regression with a random intercept to predict the odds of being a frequent user in children from different sociodemographic groups.

Boys had a slightly greater likelihood than girls (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.06). Children of Asian and mixed ethnic groups were more likely to be frequent users than those from white ethnic groups, while children from black and 'other' had a lower likelihood (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05; OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.06; OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.90; OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.92, respectively).

108133,Strategies for Evaluating Telehealth.,2020-08-18,"Cellular senescence is a state of growth arrest that occurs after cells encounter various stresses. Senescence contributes to tumour suppression, embryonic development, and wound healing. It impacts on the pathology of various diseases by secreting inflammatory chemokines, immune modulators and other bioactive factors. These secretory biosignatures ultimately cause inflammation, tissue fibrosis, immunosenescence and many ageing-related diseases such as atrial fibrillation (AF). Because the molecular mechanisms underpinning AF development remain unclear, current treatments are suboptimal and have serious side effects. In this review, we summarize recent results describing the role of senescence in AF. We propose that senescence factors induce AF and have a causative role. Hence, targeting senescence and its secretory phenotype may attenuate AF.","Guo, Guangran; Watterson, Steven; Zhang, Shu-Dong; Bjourson, Anthony; McGilligan, Victoria; Peace, Aaron; Rai, Taranjit Singh",Ageing research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2021.101363; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34023420/,251

Here, we combine several of these (epidemic) models to create a (pandemic) model of viral spread among regions. Our focus is on a second wave of new cases that may result from loss of immunity-and the exchange of people between regions-and how mortality rates can be ameliorated under different strategic responses. In particular, we consider hard or soft social distancing strategies predicated on national (Federal) or regional (State) estimates of the prevalence of infection in the population. The modelling is demonstrated using timeseries of new cases and deaths from the United States to estimate the parameters of a factorial (compartmental) epidemiological model of each State and, crucially, coupling between States. Using Bayesian model reduction, we identify the effective connectivity between States that best explains the initial phases of the outbreak in the United States. Using the ensuing posterior parameter estimates, we then evaluate the likely outcomes of different policies in terms of mortality, working days lost due to lockdown and demands upon critical care. The provisional results of this modelling suggest that social distancing and loss of immunity are the two key factors that underwrite a return to endemic equilibrium.","Friston, Karl J; Parr, Thomas; Zeidman, Peter; Razi, Adeel; Flandin, Guillaume; Daunizeau, Jean; Hulme, Oliver J; Billig, Alexander J; Litvak, Vladimir; Price, Catherine J; Moran, Rosalyn J; Lambert, Christian",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15986.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954262/,251
108781,"Necrotizing enterocolitis: etiology, presentation, management, and outcomes.",2009,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is involved in the replication of a broad range of viruses. Since replication of the murine hepatitis virus (MHV) is impaired upon proteasomal inhibition, the relevance of the UPS for the replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was investigated in this study. We demonstrate that the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 strongly inhibits SARS-CoV replication by interfering with early steps of the viral life cycle. Surprisingly, other proteasomal inhibitors (e.g., lactacystin and bortezomib) only marginally affected viral replication, indicating that the effect of MG132 is independent of proteasomal impairment. Induction of autophagy by MG132 treatment was excluded from playing a role, and no changes in SARS-CoV titers were observed during infection of wild-type or autophagy-deficient ATG5(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts overexpressing the human SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Since MG132 also inhibits the cysteine protease m-calpain, we addressed the role of calpains in the early SARS-CoV life cycle using calpain inhibitors III (MDL28170) and VI (SJA6017). In fact, m-calpain inhibition with MDL28170 resulted in an even more pronounced inhibition of SARS-CoV replication (>7 orders of magnitude) than did MG132. Additional m-calpain knockdown experiments confirmed the dependence of SARS-CoV replication on the activity of the cysteine protease m-calpain. Taken together, we provide strong experimental evidence that SARS-CoV has unique replication requirements which are independent of functional UPS or autophagy pathways compared to other coronaviruses. Additionally, this work highlights an important role for m-calpain during early steps of the SARS-CoV life cycle.","Schneider, Martha; Ackermann, Kerstin; Stuart, Melissa; Wex, Claudia; Protzer, Ulrike; Schätzl, Hermann M; Gilch, Sabine",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01001-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22787216/,251

Dysfunctions of LINC complexes are associated with pathologies such as cancer and muscular disorders. The mechanical roles of LINC complexes are poorly understood. To address this, we used genetically encoded FRET biosensors of molecular tension in a nesprin protein of the LINC complex of fibroblastic and epithelial cells in culture. We exposed cells to mechanical, genetic, and pharmacological perturbations, mimicking a range of physiological and pathological situations. We show that nesprin experiences tension generated by the cytoskeleton and acts as a mechanical sensor of cell packing. Moreover, nesprin discriminates between inductions of partial and complete epithelial-mesenchymal transitions. We identify the implicated mechanisms, which involve α-catenin capture at the nuclear envelope by nesprin upon its relaxation, thereby regulating β-catenin transcription. Our data thus implicate LINC complex proteins as mechanotransducers that fine-tune β-catenin signaling in a manner dependent on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition program.","Déjardin, Théophile; Carollo, Pietro Salvatore; Sipieter, François; Davidson, Patricia M; Seiler, Cynthia; Cuvelier, Damien; Cadot, Bruno; Sykes, Cecile; Gomes, Edgar R; Borghi, Nicolas",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201908036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32790861/,251

The University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health Public Health GIS team developed a methodology for assessing and deriving vulnerability indices based on the premise that these indices are, in the final analysis, classifiers. Application of this methodology to several Midwestern states with a commonly used SVI indicates that by using only the SVI rankings there is a risk of assigning a high priority to locations with the lowest mortality rates and low priority to locations with the highest mortality rates. Based on the findings, we propose using a two-dimensional approach to rationalize the distribution of vaccinations. This approach has the potential to account for areas with high vulnerability characteristics as well as to incorporate the areas that were hard hit by the pandemic.","Arling, Greg; Blaser, Matthew; Cailas, Michael D; Canar, John R; Cooper, Brian; Flax-Hatch, Joel; Geraci, Peter J; Osiecki, Kristin M; Sambanis, Apostolis",Online journal of public health informatics,https://doi.org/10.5210/ojphi.v13i1.11621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33936526/,251

This study aims at developing and implementing education on infection prevention and management of patients with suspected or known COVID-19 for the nursing staff providing care. Following guidelines from the hospital's COVID-19 oversight committee, the Department of Professional Practice and Education rapidly initiated education on several key topics. This was accomplished by teamwork within the department to quickly identify priorities and suspend noncritical programs. Multiple training methods were deployed while a smaller group of educators developed additional training. Sixty to seventy percent of 1015 staff were trained within 6 days. Soon after, several additional educational topics were identified and training was concluded over a 3-week period. Training can be provided on an urgent basis with the use of multiple educational methods, suspension of noncritical programs, and teamwork.

109655,Response to Decline in use of phototherapy in France from 2010 to 2019.,2021-06-17,"BACKGROUND Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition affecting 10% to 15% of reproductive-age women and may cause dyspareunia, dysmenorrhoea, and infertility. One treatment strategy is combining surgery and medical therapy to reduce the recurrence of endometriosis. Though the combination of surgery and medical therapy appears to be beneficial, there is a lack of clarity about the appropriate timing of when medical therapy should be used in relation with surgery, that is, before, after, or both before and after surgery, to maximize treatment response. OBJECTIVES To determine the effectiveness of medical therapies for hormonal suppression before, after, or both before and after surgery for endometriosis for improving painful symptoms, reducing disease recurrence, and increasing pregnancy rates. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and two trials registers in November 2019 together with reference checking and contact with study authors and experts in the field to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared medical therapies for hormonal suppression before, after, or before and after, therapeutic surgery for endometriosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Where possible, we combined data using risk ratio (RR), standardized mean difference or mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Primary outcomes were: painful symptoms of endometriosis as measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain, other validated scales or dichotomous outcomes; and recurrence of disease as evidenced by EEC (Endoscopic Endometriosis Classification), rAFS (revised American Fertility Society), or rASRM (revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine) scores at second-look laparoscopy. MAIN RESULTS We included 26 trials with 3457 women with endometriosis. We used the term ""surgery alone"" to refer to placebo or no medical therapy. Presurgical medical therapy compared with placebo or no medical therapy Compared to surgery alone, we are uncertain if presurgical medical hormonal suppression reduces pain recurrence at 12 months or less (dichotomous) (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.66; 1 RCT, n = 262; very low-quality evidence) or whether it reduces disease recurrence at 12 months - total (AFS score) (MD -9.6, 95% CI -11.42 to -7.78; 1 RCT, n = 80; very low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if presurgical medical hormonal suppression decreases disease recurrence at 12 months or less (EEC stage) compared to surgery alone (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; 1 RCT, n = 262; very low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if presurgical medical hormonal suppression improves pregnancy rates compared to surgery alone (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.36; 1 RCT, n = 262; very low-quality evidence). No trials reported pelvic pain at 12 months or less (continuous) or disease recurrence at 12 months or less. Postsurgical medical therapy compared with placebo or no medical therapy We are uncertain about the improvement observed in pelvic pain at 12 months or less (continuous) between postsurgical medical hormonal suppression and surgery alone (MD -0.48, 95% CI -0.64 to -0.31; 4 RCTs, n = 419; I2 = 94%; very low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if there is a difference in pain recurrence at 12 months or less (dichotomous) between postsurgical medical hormonal suppression and surgery alone (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.12; 5 RCTs, n = 634; I2 = 20%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if postsurgical medical hormonal suppression improves disease recurrence at 12 months - total (AFS score) compared to surgery alone (MD -2.29, 95% CI -4.01 to -0.57; 1 RCT, n = 51; very low-quality evidence). Disease recurrence at 12 months or less may be reduced with postsurgical medical hormonal suppression compared to surgery alone (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.54; 4 RCTs, n = 433; I2 = 58%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain about the reduction observed in disease recurrence at 12 months or less (EEC stage) between postsurgical medical hormonal suppression and surgery alone (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.91; 1 RCT, n = 285; very low-quality evidence). Pregnancy rate is probably increased with postsurgical medical hormonal suppression compared to surgery alone (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.39; 11 RCTs, n = 932; I2 = 24%; moderate-quality evidence). Pre- and postsurgical medical therapy compared with surgery alone or surgery and placebo There were no trials identified in the search for this comparison. Presurgical medical therapy compared with postsurgical medical therapy We are uncertain about the difference in pain recurrence at 12 months or less (dichotomous) between postsurgical and presurgical medical hormonal suppression therapy (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.07; 2 RCTs, n = 326; I2 = 2%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain about the difference in disease recurrence at 12 months or less (EEC stage) between postsurgical and presurgical medical hormonal suppression therapy (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.28; 1 RCT, n = 273; very low-quality evidence). We are uncertain about the difference in pregnancy rate between postsurgical and presurgical medical hormonal suppression therapy (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.21; 1 RCT, n = 273; very low-quality evidence). No trials reported pelvic pain at 12 months or less (continuous), disease recurrence at 12 months - total (AFS score) or disease recurrence at 12 months or less (dichotomous). Postsurgical medical therapy compared with pre- and postsurgical medical therapy There were no trials identified in the search for this comparison. Serious adverse effects for medical therapies reviewed There was insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion regarding serious adverse effects, as no studies reported data suitable for analysis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that the data about the efficacy of medical therapy for endometriosis are inconclusive, related to the timing of hormonal suppression therapy relative to surgery for endometriosis. In our various comparisons of the timing of hormonal suppression therapy, women who receive postsurgical medical therapy compared with no medical therapy or placebo may experience benefit in terms of disease recurrence and pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence regarding hormonal suppression therapy at other time points in relation to surgery for women with endometriosis.","Chen, Innie; Veth, Veerle B; Choudhry, Abdul J; Murji, Ally; Zakhari, Andrew; Black, Amanda Y; Agarpao, Carmina; Maas, Jacques Wm",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd003678.pub3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33206374/,251

The aim of our study is to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) in patients older than 60. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between January 2005 and December 2013, 68 LAGB, 73 LSG, and 212 RYGB patients were 60 years or older at the time of primary procedure. A retrospective review was performed in these patients. RESULTS Mean age and body mass index (BMI) was 62.7 ± 2.2, 64.1 ± 2.9, and 62.6 ± 2.3 years and 42.7 ± 5.6, 44.0 ± 7.0, and 45.2 ± 6.7 kg/m(2) for LAGB, LSG, and RYGB at the time of procedure, respectively. Seven (10.3%) patients from the LAGB, 3 (4.1%) from the LSG, and 29 (13.8%) from the RYGB group required readmissions. Reoperation rate was 10.3, 1.4, and 9.5% in LAGB, LSG, and RYGB, respectively. The difference in reoperation rates was statistically significant (p < 0.03) while that in readmission rates was not (p > 0.58). Procedure-related mortality rate was 1.4% in the RYGB group, while no mortality was observed in LSG and LAGB groups. At 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively, mean percentage of excess weight loss were highest in the RYGB group, followed by LSG and LAGB group (p < 0.01). Mean number of comorbidities at the last follow-up significantly decreased in LSG and RYGB patients. CONCLUSIONS LSG showed the lowest readmission and reoperation rate, and RYGB patients had the highest mortality rate. Weight loss and comorbidity resolution were effectively achieved in RYGB and LSG patients.","Moon, Rena C; Kreimer, Flavio; Teixeira, Andre F; Campos, Josemberg M; Ferraz, Alvaro; Jawad, Muhammad A",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-015-1824-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26220238/,251
109910,Extrafollicular B cell responses correlate with neutralizing antibodies and morbidity in COVID-19.,2020-10-07,"BACKGROUND Red blood cells are essential for modern medicine but managing their collection and supply to cope with fluctuating demands represents a major challenge. As deterministic models based on predicted population changes have been problematic, there remains a need for more precise and reliable prediction of use. Here, we develop three new time-series methods to predict red cell use 4 to 52 weeks ahead. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS From daily aggregates of red blood cell (RBC) units issued from 2005 to 2011 from the NHS Blood and Transplant, we generated a new set of non-overlapping weekly data by summing the daily data over 7 days and derived the average blood use per week over 4-week and 52-week periods. We used three new methods for linear prediction of blood use by computing the coefficients using Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) algorithm. RESULTS We optimized the time-window size, order of the prediction, and order of the polynomial fit for our data set. By exploiting the annual periodicity of the data, we achieved significant improvements in long-term predictions, as well as modest improvements in short-term predictions. The new methods predicted mean RBC use with a standard deviation of the percentage error of 2.5% for 4 weeks ahead and 3.4% for 52 weeks ahead. CONCLUSION This paradigm allows short- and long-term prediction of RBC use and could provide reliable and precise prediction up to 52 weeks ahead to improve the efficiency of blood services and sufficiency of blood supply with reduced costs.","Nandi, Anita K; Roberts, David J; Nandi, Asoke K",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.15966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691487/,251

Viruses cause diseases; however, most of the pathologic effects of these diseases are not caused directly by the viruses but by the side effects of the immune response. It is possible that sequence identity may exist between viruses and humans and may be biologically relevant to the infection of virus. The aim of this study was to find out whether sequence identity exists between viruses and humans. METHODS BLAST searches of virus genome sequences against human genome were performed using the resources of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). RESULTS All the viruses that were compared to humans contain different numbers of short identical regions to the human genome. Each identical region was 20-30 nt and some were found at multiple sites within the human genome. CONCLUSION A new role of the virus in the relationship between viruses and humans was taken into account. We assume that viruses have brought their sequence into the human genome in the long past history of human-virus interaction. In the process, viruses play roles as carriers to transfer external sequence information into the human genome.","Lin, Gui-Gao; Li, Jin-Ming",Intervirology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000225937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19546577/,251

Currently, only halofuginone is approved for prophylactic and metaphylactic treatment of calves but this drug suffers from its limited safety margins. For treatment of immunodeficient human patients, only nitazoxanide and paramomycin are used but data regarding their efficacy are controversial. Aim of the present study was to test a substituted benzimidazole (BAY-AF76184) and a heterocyclic substituted 1,2,4-triazin (BAY-AB24992), both drugs with known anti-protozoal activity, for their potential ability to interfere with Cryptosporidium parvum development in vitro. Development of C. parvum in HCT-8 cells treated with these compounds was compared to negative controls and parasites treated with paromomycin or halofuginone using real-time PCR targeting the 18S rDNAs of parasites and host cells as template. Potential cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects of drugs were analysed using a lactate dehydrogenase and a WST-1 assay, respectively. BAY-AF76184 and paromomycin dose-dependently inhibited development of C. parvum with EC50 values of 2.37 μM and 69.5 μM, respectively. Although high concentrations of halofuginone and BAY-AB24992 also significantly inhibited parasite development, effects of lower concentrations were very heterogeneous preventing calculation of EC50 values. Halofuginone and BAY-AF76184 dose-dependently interfered with host cell proliferation (EC50 values of 0.35 μM and 9.07 μM, respectively) and the latter also had direct cytotoxic effects (EC50=48.78 μM). However, drug concentrations required for cytopathic were higher than those for effects against C. parvum. Therefore, both BAY-AB24992 and BAY-AF76184 should be considered for further evaluation, e.g. using in vivo models.","Schupfner, Maja; Greif, Gisela; Lendner, Matthias; Daugschies, Arwid; Lippuner, Christoph; von Samson-Himmelstjerna, Georg; Krücken, Jürgen",Parasitology research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-013-3439-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23765343/,251

Laparoscopic unroofing is a relatively safe and easy technique, but a significant number of recurrences has been reported. Thus, complete cystectomy with partial splenectomy is recommended by several surgeons. However, patients sometimes suffer from intraoperative bleeding. Here, we report a patient with a giant non-parasitic splenic cyst who underwent subtotal cystectomy with partial splenectomy. After the dissection of the vessels circulating the upper pole at the splenic hilum, the resection line of the splenic parenchyma was on the ischemic side of the cyanotic demarcation line. A vessel sealing system and laparoscopic coagulation shears were used for the resection. We intentionally left about 10% of the cyst wall to avoid bleeding from the non-ischemic splenic parenchyma and remaining vessels. No recurrence has been detected after 6 months of observation. We believe this method could be a useful alternative procedure for the treatment of non-parasitic splenic cysts and preservation of the splenic parenchyma.","Iimuro, Yuji; Okada, Toshihiro; Sueoka, Hideaki; Hai, Seikan; Kondo, Yuichi; Suzumura, Kazuhiro; Fujimoto, Jiro",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23879417/,251

This study aimed to compare a modified technique of membrane fixation that utilizes periosteal sutures (using a pouch design) with the traditional approach, which does not use membrane fixation. METHODS Twenty-eight patients with a total of 168 teeth treated were divided into two groups: 1-A, in which patients were treated using the modified technique (with membrane fixation), and group 2-B, in which patients were treated using the traditional technique (without membrane fixation). The postoperative bone thickness was evaluated via radiographic examination. RESULTS Postoperative improvements in bone augmentation were detected in both groups. At 12 months, the values of the CHBT (measured from the midpoint of the coronal third to the labial cortical surface, 0.84 ± 0.33 mm) and the values of VBL (measured from the alveolar crest to the cemento-enamel junction, - 2.35 ± 0.80 mm)were significantly greater in the modified technique group than those in the traditional technique group (CHBT:0.12 ± 0.21 mm and VBL:-1.39 ± 0.99 mm; P = 0.00 and P = 0.01).

In patients with unconfirmed functional patency, balloon-assisted enteroscopy was performed to evaluate the reason. RESULTS Functional patency was confirmed in 44 of 57 patients. Patency was confirmed in 38 patients (66.7%) at 30 h. In 6 of 19 patients (31.6%) in whom patency was not confirmed at 30 h, patency was confirmed within 72 h and no capsule retention (CR) occurred. The rate of pan-enteroscopy did not differ between patients whose patency was confirmed at 30 h and those whose patency was confirmed within 72 h. Excretion time of the PPC significantly correlated with that of the capsule (r = 0.650). Severe adhesions (>5 cm) interfered with PPC passage in 2 patients, despite the absence of critical stricture. The rate of no CR in patients with functional patency confirmed by prior PPC was 97.7%. Misjudgment of the location of the PPC is a risk for CR. CONCLUSIONS Extending the time to confirm functional patency to 72 h may be acceptable and increase the possibility to perform CE safely in whom CE can perform intrinsically.

Wakelam (1955-2020).",2020-06-01,"INTRODUCTION Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) guidelines recommend limiting interruptions of chest compressions because prolonged hands-off (i.e., non-compression) time compromises tissue perfusion. 2010 European Resuscitation Council guidelines suggest that chest compressions should be paused less than 10 s during airway device insertion. METHODS With approval of the local ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna and written informed consent, we recruited 40 voluntary emergency medical technicians, none of whom had advanced airway management experience. After a standardised audio-visual lecture and practical demonstration, technicians performed airway management with each six airway devices (endotracheal tube, Combitube, EasyTube, laryngeal tube, Laryngeal Mask Airway, and I-Gel) during on-going chest compressions in a randomised sequence on a Resusci Anne Advanced Simulator. Data were analysed using a mixed-effects model accounting for the repeated measurements and pair-wise comparisons among the airway devices. RESULTS The hands-off time associated with airway management using an endotracheal tube (including all intubation attempts) was 48 s (95% confidence interval: 43-53). The hands-off time for airway management using a laryngeal tube was 8.4 (3.4-16.4) s, Combitube 10.0 (4.9-15.1) s, EasyTube 11.4 (6.4-16.4) s, LMA 13.3 (8.2-18.3) s and for I-Gel 15.9 (10.8-20.9) s. Hands-off time was significantly longer with the conventional endotracheal tube than with any of the other airway systems. Only a third of the technicians successfully inserted an endotracheal tube whereas all of them successfully positioned each supraglottic device. CONCLUSION Supraglottic devices appear to be a reasonable emergency airway management strategy, even for inexperienced personnel.","Ruetzler, Kurt; Gruber, Christina; Nabecker, Sabine; Wohlfarth, Philipp; Priemayr, Anita; Frass, Michael; Kimberger, Oliver; Sessler, Daniel I; Roessler, Bernhard",Resuscitation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2011.03.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21514986/,251

The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility, safety, and oncological outcomes of the procedure and to report the experience in 3 centers. METHODS Retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was performed of all patients with benign lesions or ≤cT1N0 rectal cancer who underwent TEO with curative intent at 3 Belgian centers (2012 through 2014). RESULTS Eighty-three patients underwent 84 TEOs for 89 rectal lesions (37 adenomas, 43 adenocarcinomas, 1 gastrointestinal stromal tumor, 1 lipoma, 2 neuroendocrine tumors, and 5 scar tissues). Operative time was associated with lesion size (P < .001). Postoperative complications occurred in 13 patients: 7 hemorrhages, 1 urinary tract infection, 1 urinary retention, 2 abscesses, 1 anastomotic stenosis, and 1 entrance into the peritoneal cavity. Median hospital stay was 3 days (range, 1-8). During a median follow-up of 13 months (range, 2-27), there was 1 recurrence. CONCLUSION Although longer follow-up is still necessary, TEO appears to be an effective method of excising benign tumors and low-risk T1 carcinomas of the rectum. However, TEO should be considered as part of the diagnostic work-up. Furthermore, the resected specimen of a TEO procedure allows adequate local staging in contrast to an endoscopic piecemeal excision. Nevertheless, definitive histology must be appreciated, and in case of unfavorable histology, radical salvage resection still has to be performed.","D'Hondt, Mathieu; Yoshihara, Emi; Dedrye, Lieven; Vindevoghel, Koen; Nuytens, Frederiek; Pottel, Hans",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2016.00093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28144126/,251

The use of collagen matrix graft along with hydrogel dural sealant is a common method of IDT repair. With this method, there have been several reported cases of detrimental dural sealant expansion in the literature. One case study reported an expansion rate greater than 300%; many report neurologic damage. This article reports the clinical course of two patients who developed postoperative transcutaneous drainage of a gel-like substance after the use of a dural sealant, which is a previously unreported complication. Methods The clinical course and treatment outcome of two patients is presented. Results Both patients experienced postoperative transcutaneous drainage of a gel-like substance at the surgical site. Case one began draining this substance on postoperative day 14. This patient required no further intervention, and the drainage ended after 3 mL of a gel-like substance was expressed from his incision while in the clinic. Case two began draining the gel on postoperative day 16. This patient underwent two washout procedures and resolution of the drainage. No infection was ever detected. Conclusions To our knowledge, our patients are the first reported cases of transcutaneous drainage of expanded dural sealant. It is important to take into consideration the unexpected expansion of a dural sealant when using it for the repair of IDT.","Siman, Homayoun; Techy, Fernando",Global spine journal,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0035-1550088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26835216/,251

The disease can be caused by several viral species in the Lyssavirus genus, but the type species, rabies virus (RABV), is by far the most important from a zoonosis perspective. The extreme neurotropism of RABV and the evolutionarily conserved elements and structures of the mammalian brain suggest that this virus evolved an ultimate niche for replication, simultaneously exploiting classical social behavior of a wide diversity of hosts among the chiropters and carnivores. There is substantial evidence that RABV originated in bats and later switched hosts to yield globally disseminated canine rabies. Following the revolutionary work of Louis Pasteur, control and elimination of dog rabies was achieved in Europe, but widespread colonial introduction of European strains of dog RABV to other parts of the world occurred. Thus, dog rabies spread rapidly in the 1900s, and today the vast majority of the tens of thousands of annual human rabies cases stem from dog rabies, which has become endemic in the entire developing world. The fact that human rabies is preventable, through control in the dog reservoir on one hand and through effective prophylaxis in cases of exposure on the other hand, is an indictment of public health strategies and practices. This article discusses some of the drivers that have contributed to the recurrent neglect of rabies in the modern world, as well as evolving One Health-based rabies control partnerships and initiatives that have been progressive, productive, and promising of true global benefits.","Nel, Louis H",Microbiology spectrum,https://doi.org/10.1128/microbiolspec.oh-0006-2012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26184959/,251

Negative attitudes and beliefs are often found among physicians and others involved in treating obesity and may adversely impact the effectiveness of management. In this international study, healthcare professionals were invited to complete an online survey of their attitudes and practice in the management of excess body weight. A total of 335 clinicians completed the survey of whom approximately half were based in Europe. A key finding from the survey is that, while participants are generally confident in their ability to manage overweight and obesity effectively, they also report that most of their patients are not successful in achieving their weight loss goals. At the same time, participants tended to overestimate the effectiveness of current medical management in maintaining reductions in body weight. Educational initiatives addressing the real-life effectiveness of different weight control interventions may help to close the gap between clinicians' perceptions and reality in the management of excess body weight.","Leiter, L A; Astrup, A; Andrews, R C; Cuevas, A; Horn, D B; Kunešová, M; Wittert, G; Finer, N",Clinical obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/cob.12109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26238414/,251

115853,The importance of establishing a suitable study population in osteoarthritis studies. Comment on the article by MacFarlane et al.,2021-01-09,"BACKGROUND The respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to present diagnostic challenges. Early research showed thoracic (chest) imaging to be sensitive but not specific in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, this is a rapidly developing field and these findings need to be re-evaluated in the light of new research. This is the first update of this 'living systematic review'. This update focuses on people suspected of having COVID-19 and excludes studies with only confirmed COVID-19 participants. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic imaging (computed tomography (CT), X-ray and ultrasound) in people with suspected COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS We searched the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library, and repositories of COVID-19 publications through to 22 June 2020. We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA We included studies of all designs that recruited participants of any age group suspected to have COVID-19, and which reported estimates of test accuracy, or provided data from which estimates could be computed. When studies used a variety of reference standards, we retained the classification of participants as COVID-19 positive or negative as used in the study. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS-2 domain-list independently, in duplicate. We categorised included studies into three groups based on classification of index test results: studies that reported specific criteria for index test positivity (group 1); studies that did not report specific criteria, but had the test reader(s) explicitly classify the imaging test result as either COVID-19 positive or negative (group 2); and studies that reported an overview of index test findings, without explicitly classifying the imaging test as either COVID-19 positive or negative (group 3). We presented the results of estimated sensitivity and specificity using paired forest plots, and summarised in tables. We used a bivariate meta-analysis model where appropriate. We presented uncertainty of the accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS We included 34 studies: 30 were cross-sectional studies with 8491 participants suspected of COVID-19, of which 4575 (54%) had a final diagnosis of COVID-19; four were case-control studies with 848 cases and controls in total, of which 464 (55%) had a final diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT was evaluated in 31 studies (8014 participants, 4224 (53%) cases), chest X-ray in three studies (1243 participants, 784 (63%) cases), and ultrasound of the lungs in one study (100 participants, 31 (31%) cases). Twenty-six per cent (9/34) of all studies were available only as preprints. Nineteen studies were conducted in Asia, 10 in Europe, four in North America and one in Australia. Sixteen studies included only adults, 15 studies included both adults and children and one included only children. Two studies did not report the ages of participants. Twenty-four studies included inpatients, four studies included outpatients, while the remaining six studies were conducted in unclear settings. The majority of included studies had a high or unclear risk of bias with respect to participant selection, index test, reference standard, and participant flow. For chest CT in suspected COVID-19 participants (31 studies, 8014 participants, 4224 (53%) cases) the sensitivity ranged from 57.4% to 100%, and specificity ranged from 0% to 96.0%. The pooled sensitivity of chest CT in suspected COVID-19 participants was 89.9% (95% CI 85.7 to 92.9) and the pooled specificity was 61.1% (95% CI 42.3 to 77.1). Sensitivity analyses showed that when the studies from China were excluded, the studies from other countries demonstrated higher specificity compared to the overall included studies. When studies that did not classify index tests as positive or negative for COVID-19 (group 3) were excluded, the remaining studies (groups 1 and 2) demonstrated higher specificity compared to the overall included studies. Sensitivity analyses limited to cross-sectional studies, or studies where at least two reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests were conducted if the first was negative, did not substantively alter the accuracy estimates. We did not identify publication status as a source of heterogeneity. For chest X-ray in suspected COVID-19 participants (3 studies, 1243 participants, 784 (63%) cases) the sensitivity ranged from 56.9% to 89.0% and specificity from 11.1% to 88.9%. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound of the lungs in suspected COVID-19 participants (1 study, 100 participants, 31 (31%) cases) were 96.8% and 62.3%, respectively. We could not perform a meta-analysis for chest X-ray or ultrasound due to the limited number of included studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that chest CT is sensitive and moderately specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected patients, meaning that CT may have limited capability in differentiating SARS-CoV-2 infection from other causes of respiratory illness. However, we are limited in our confidence in these results due to the poor study quality and the heterogeneity of included studies. Because of limited data, accuracy estimates of chest X-ray and ultrasound of the lungs for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 cases should be carefully interpreted. Future diagnostic accuracy studies should pre-define positive imaging findings, include direct comparisons of the various modalities of interest on the same participant population, and implement improved reporting practices. Planned updates of this review will aim to: increase precision around the accuracy estimates for chest CT (ideally with low risk of bias studies); obtain further data to inform accuracy of chest X-rays and ultrasound; and obtain data to further fulfil secondary objectives (e.g. 'threshold' effects, comparing accuracy estimates across different imaging modalities) to inform the utility of imaging along different diagnostic pathways.","Islam, Nayaar; Salameh, Jean-Paul; Leeflang, Mariska Mg; Hooft, Lotty; McGrath, Trevor A; van der Pol, Christian B; Frank, Robert A; Kazi, Sakib; Prager, Ross; Hare, Samanjit S; Dennie, Carole; Spijker, René; Deeks, Jonathan J; Dinnes, Jacqueline; Jenniskens, Kevin; Korevaar, Daniël A; Cohen, Jérémie F; Van den Bruel, Ann; Takwoingi, Yemisi; van de Wijgert, Janneke; Wang, Junfeng; McInnes, Matthew Df",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013639.pub3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242342/,251

The study aimed to estimate the risk of exposure for COVID-19 across various workplace settings and demographics in the State of Qatar. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted utilizing surveillance data of all workplaces with 10 or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. These workplaces were categorized using a mapping table adapted from the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, 2017 version. The data was then analyzed to estimate and compare the positivity rate as an indicator of the risk of developing COVID-19 infection across various workplace settings in the State of Qatar. Results The highest positivity rate was reported amongst the Construction & Related (40.0%) and the Retail & Wholesale Trade sectors (40.0%), whereas, the lowest positivity rate was attributed to the healthcare workplace setting (11.0%). The highest incidence of COVID-19 infections occurred in South Asian nationalities and in the male gender. The private funded sector employees have seen higher positivity rate than employees of the governmental funded sector. Conclusion The elevated risk of infection in Construction and Retail & Wholesale Trade is probably due to environmental and educational vulnerabilities. The predominant labor force of those workplace categories is South Asian craft and male manual workers. Alternatively, the better containment of the healthcare workplace setting can be attributed to the enforcement of infection control and occupational safety measures. These findings imply the importance of using preventive and surveillance strategies for high-risk workplace settings appropriately.","Al-Kuwari, Mohamed Ghaith; Al-Nuaimi, Asma Ali; Abdulmajeed, Jazeel; Semaan, Sandy; Al-Romaihi, Hamad Eid; Kandy, Mujeeb Chettiyam; Swamy, Selvakumar",Journal of occupational medicine and toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12995-021-00311-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34155441/,251

MATERIALS AND METHODS In experimental set-up, 24 pigs were treated by laparoscopic mesh placement. Two different meshes (PP/ORC and PP/ePTFE) and four fixation devices were evaluated: a 6.4 mm poly(D,L: )-lactide pushpin (tack I), a 6.8 mm poly(D,L: )-lactide with blunt tip (tack II), a 4.1 mm poly(glycolide-co-L-lactide) (tack III) and one titanium tack (control tack). A first group of animals (n = 12) was euthanized after 2 weeks survival and a second group (n = 12) after 6 months. At euthanasia, a relaparoscopy was performed to assess adhesion formation followed by laparotomy with excision of the entire abdominal wall. Tensile strength of the individual fixation systems was tested with the use of a tensiometer by measuring the force to pull the tack out of the mesh. Additionally, the foreign body reaction to the fixation systems was evaluated histologically as was their potential degradation. RESULTS At 2 weeks the tensile strength was significantly higher for the control tack (31.98 N/cm²) compared to the resorbable devices. Except for tack II, the tensile strength was higher when the devices were fixed in a PP/ePTFE mesh compared to the PP/ORC mesh. After 6 months only tack III was completely resorbed, while tack I (9.292 N/cm²) had the lowest tensile strength. At this time-point similar tensile strength was observed for both tack II (29.56 N/cm²) and the control tack (27.77 N/cm²). Adhesions seem to be more depending on the type of mesh, in favor of PP/ePTFE. CONCLUSION At long term, the 4.1 mm poly(glycolide-co-L-lactide) tack was the only tack completely resorbed while the 6.8 mm poly(D,L: )-lactide tack with blunt tip reached equal strengths to the permanent tack.","Reynvoet, Emmelie; Berrevoet, Frederik; De Somer, Filip; Vercauteren, Griet; Vanoverbeke, Ingrid; Chiers, Koen; Troisi, Roberto",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2224-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22476828/,251

However, the biologic mechanisms responsible for this relationship remain unclear. Thus, in this study, the global gene expression in gingival tissue with periodontitis is profiled in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats compared with Zucker normoglycemic littermates (Lean). METHODS At age 8 weeks, ZDF and Lean rats received ligature placement around the maxillary right second molar. At 0, 14, 28, 42, and 56 days after ligature placement, the maxilla around the molar was analyzed using microcomputed tomography. Two and 7 days after ligature placement, total RNA in the gingival tissue was isolated, and gene expression analysis was conducted using a rat oligo array. To validate the microarray findings, the selected genes were analyzed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS There was a significant difference regarding the average amount of bone resorption between ZDF and Lean rats from days 14 to 56. On day 2, it was found that 113 genes were regulated (20 upregulated, 93 downregulated) in the presence of DM. Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was significantly higher in gingival tissue with periodontitis from ZDF rats compared with that from Lean rats. On day 7, interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-24 mRNA levels were significantly lower, whereas IL-2 level was significantly elevated. CONCLUSION The results of this study indicate that the role of DM in modulating bone breakdown related to periodontitis may involve an increased level of LBP and reduced levels of T-helper 2 cytokines.","Soboku, Kyoko; Kikuchi, Takeshi; Fujita, Sachiko; Takeda, Hiroaki; Naruse, Keiko; Matsubara, Tatsuaki; Noguchi, Toshihide",Journal of periodontology,https://doi.org/10.1902/jop.2013.120705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23730973/,251

Furthermore, associated penile skin changes such as lichen sclerosus or stenosis of the penile shaft skin are often irreversible. Treatment includes removal of the diseased shaft skin surrounding the penis, in combination with a limited panniculectomy.

The major components of the RIG-I- and TLR pathways have putatively been identified, but previously unrecognised kinases may contribute to virus infection-induced activation of the IFN response. Here, we screened a human kinase cDNA library, termed the kinome, using an IFN-λ1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter assay in HEK293 cells during Sendai virus infection. Of the 568 kinases analysed, nearly 50 enhanced IFN-λ1 gene expression at least twofold in response to Sendai virus infection. The best activators were FYN (FYN oncogene related to SRC, FGR, YES), serine/threonine kinase 24, activin A receptor type 1 and SRPK1 (SFRS protein kinase 1). These kinases enhanced RIG-I-dependent IFN-λ1 promoter activation via IFN-stimulated response and NF-κB elements, as confirmed using mutant IFN-λ1 promoter constructs. FYN and SRPK1 enhanced IFN-λ1 and CXCL10 protein production via the RIG-I pathway, and stimulated RIG-I and MyD88-dependent phosphorylation of IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors, respectively. We conclude that several previously unrecognised kinases, particularly FYN and SRPK1, positively regulate IFN-λ1 and similarly regulated cytokine and chemokine genes during viral infection.","Nousiainen, Laura; Sillanpää, Maarit; Jiang, Miao; Thompson, James; Taipale, Jussi; Julkunen, Ilkka",Innate immunity,https://doi.org/10.1177/1753425912473345; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23405030/,251

Management options include discharge home versus overnight observation, with the latter allowing monitoring for immediate postoperative complications, presumably reducing the need for subsequent readmission. This study investigates the association between overnight observation and ambulatory management of children undergoing Sistrunk procedures and relevant postoperative complication and revisit rates to clarify best practice for these patients. METHODS This was a retrospective database review using the Pediatric Health Information System database from 2007 to 2016. RESULTS The cited dataset identified 6,434 qualifying patients, categorized into ambulatory versus overnight observation cohorts. The overall 30-day revisit rate was 4.9%; the revisit rate with overnight observation (6.1%) was higher than for ambulatory patients (3.8%, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.60; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21, 2.12). Revisit rates were significantly higher in patients 2 years of age or younger compared to older patients (6.7% vs. 4.3%). The rates of return to the operating room for the observation versus ambulatory groups were 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Cervical fluid collection and neck swelling were among the most common revisit indications in both groups, with a mean time to presentation of 9 days. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that ambulatory management following a Sistrunk procedure is not associated with increased rates of common postoperative complications, readmission, or need for secondary surgical intervention. A Sistrunk procedure may be safely performed on an ambulatory basis in select cases.

These changes were controversial and attracted early attention of legal scholars and courts in the individual states and at the U.S. Supreme Court. A 2006 Supreme Court decision in Clark v. Arizona had distinct but related concerns that helped crystallize the Court's attention on both mens rea and traditional insanity defense statutes. This decision led to a dramatic precedent that may have settled these matters for generations to come. This article will discuss the changes in the Arizona statutory and case law and the interplay between these changes and the important decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court during the same time span. The result of the changes has led to a situation in Arizona where, for the most serious criminal defendants with mental illness, there is no current mechanism to acquit a defendant on the basis of insanity by a mens rea statute or otherwise.","Bloom, Joseph D; E Kirkorsky, Scott",The journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law,https://doi.org/10.29158/jaapl.210033-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34479941/,251
119031,Leadership skills in radiology: five basic principles.,2021-04-01,"Purpose Metronidazol and vancomycin were long the two best options against Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infections (CDI). Now, the cost of new drugs such as fidaxomicin directs us towards alternative treatment options, such as faecal microbiota transplant (FMT). Its effectiveness is similar to fidaxomicin. There are questions regarding its safety, but the biggest challenges are prejudice and inconvenience. Most protocols refer to FMT applied in the form of a solution. We investigated different modalities of FMT. Methods Instead of using nasoenteric tubes or colonoscopy, we place frozen or lyophilised stool in non-coated, size ""00"", hard gelatine capsules or enterosolvent, size ""0"" capsules. Results We found that non-coated, size ""00"", hard gelatine capsules are appropriate for conducting FMT. Capsules containing lyophilised supernatant with a low number of bacteria have been proven to be non-inferior to other FMT modalities. The primary cure rate in the supernatant group was 93.75%, and 66.67% in the sediment group. The overall cure rate was 82.14%. Depending on the protocol, 4-7 capsules are sufficient per patient. Capsules can be stored for up to one year at -20°C. Conclusions FMT is a feasible alternative to antibiotic treatments in CDI. Our method makes the process flexible and less inconvenient to patients. Long storage time allows a consistent supply of capsules, while small volume and formulation make the procedure tolerable.","Varga, Adorján; Kocsis, Béla; Sipos, Dávid; Kása, Péter; Vigvári, Szabolcs; Pál, Szilárd; Dembrovszky, Fanni; Farkas, Kornélia; Péterfi, Zoltán",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.657320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34150673/,251
119245,Lessons learned from SARS outbreak prompt rapid response to new coronavirus.,2013,"Background Postprescription review and feedback (PPRF) is one of the most common strategies in antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) intervention. However, disagreements between the prescribers and ASP personnel can occur. The aim of the present study was to identify the factors associated with nonadherence to PPRF intervention. Methods The present retrospective nested case-control study was performed at a tertiary care center, which has been conducting a once-weekly PPRF for carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam since 2014. Nonadherence to ASP recommendations was defined as the failure of the primary care team to modify or stop antimicrobial therapy 72 hours after the issuance of PPRF recommendations. Factors associated with nonadherence to PPRF intervention were identified using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results In total, 2466 instances of PPRF in 1714 cases between April 2014 and September 2019 were found. The nonadherence rate was 5.9%, and 44 cases were found in which carbapenems or piperacillin/tazobactam continued to be used against PPRF recommendations. Factors associated with nonadherence to PPRF recommendations were a previous history of hospitalization within 90 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-5.81) and a rapidly fatal McCabe score at the time of PPRF intervention (aOR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.18-6.98). A review of the narrative comments in the electronic medical records indicated that common reasons for nonadherence were ""the patient was sick"" (n = 12; 27.3%) and ""the antimicrobial seemed to be clinically effective"" (n = 9; 20.5%). Conclusions Nonadherence to PPRF recommendations was relatively uncommon at the study institution. However, patients with a severe disease condition frequently continued to receive broad-spectrum antimicrobials against PPRF recommendations. Understanding physicians' cognitive process in nonadherence to ASP recommendations and ASP interventions targeting medical subspecialties caring for severely ill patients is needed to improve ASP.","Takamatsu, Akane; Yao, Kenta; Murakami, Shutaro; Tagashira, Yasuaki; Hasegawa, Shinya; Honda, Hitoshi",Open forum infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832576/,251

119677,From the editor: Never send to know for whom the bell tolls.,2020,"BACKGROUND The ability to generate hospital beds in response to a mass-casualty incident is an essential component of public health preparedness. Although many acute care hospitals' emergency response plans include some provision for delaying or cancelling elective procedures in the event of an inpatient surge, no standardized method for implementing and quantifying the impact of this strategy exists in the literature. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology to prospectively emergency plan for implementing a strategy of delaying procedures and quantifying the potential impact of this strategy on creating hospital bed capacity. METHODS This is a pilot study. A categorization methodology was devised and applied retrospectively to all scheduled procedures during four one-week periods chosen by convenience. The categorization scheme grouped procedures into four categories: (A) procedures with no impact on inpatient capacity; (B) procedures that could be delayed indefinitely; (C) procedures that could be delayed by one week; and (D) procedures that could not be delayed. The categorization scheme was applied by two research assistants and an emergency medicine resident. All three raters categorized the first 100 cases to allow for calculation of inter-rater reliability. Maximal hospital bed capacity was defined as the 95th percentile weekday occupancy, as this is more representative of functional bed capacity than is the number of licensed beds. The main outcome was the number of hospital beds that could be created by postponing procedures in categories B and C. RESULTS Maximal hospital bed capacity was 816 beds. Mean occupancy during weekdays was 759 versus 694 on weekends. By postponing Group B and C procedures, a mean of 60 beds (51 general medical/surgical and nine intensive care unit (ICU)) could be created on weekdays, and four beds (three general medical/surgical and one ICU) on weekends. This represents 7.3% and 0.49% of maximal hospital bed capacity and ICU capacity, respectively. In the event that sustained surge is needed, delaying all category B and C procedures for one week would lead to the generation of 1,235 hospital-bed days. Inter-rater reliability was high (kappa = 0.74) indicating good agreement between all three raters. CONCLUSIONS For the institution studied, the strategy of delaying scheduled procedures could generate inpatient capacity with maximal impact during weekdays and little impact on weekends. Future research is needed to validate the categorization scheme and increase the ability to predict inpatient surge capacity across various hospital types and sizes.","Soremekun, Olan A; Zane, Richard D; Walls, Andrew; Allen, Matthew B; Seefeld, Kimberly J; Pallin, Daniel J",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x11006248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22107776/,251

The objective of this report is to verify the use of intravascular placement to establish an appropriate microcatheter shape. Methods Fifteen patients (15 aneurysms) were included in this study because of the predicted difficulty of microcatheter insertion and stabilisation. The SL-10 straight microcatheter was inserted into the parent artery until the tip of the catheter passed through the neck of the aneurysm. After 5 minutes, the microcatheter was pulled out and the shape acquired from intravascular placement was confirmed and compared with the three-dimensional rotational angiography. In addition, the microcatheter tip was steam-shaped for coiling and coil embolisation was performed. A silicone flow model was also used to confirm our findings. The first experiment compared the bend angle in four different microcatheters placed in the model for 5 minutes. In the second experiment, the SL-10 straight microcatheter was placed in the model, and the bend angle was measured at 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 minutes to observe the changes in bend angle over time. Results The SL-10 straight microcatheter, in place for 5 minutes, acquired a shape similar to the patient's own vessel. Among the 15 patients included, 13 were treated using an intravascular shaped microcatheter. In the flow model experiments, the SL-10 most easily acquired the vessel shape, and the shape change stabilised after 5 minutes. Conclusion Shaping the SL-10 straight microcatheter using intravascular placement is an effective shaping method for aneurysm coil embolisation.","Yamaguchi, Shinya; Ito, Osamu; Koyanagi, Yuya; Iwaki, Katsuma; Matsukado, Koichiro","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019917689926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28166669/,251

METHODS Outbreak data from Colorado, USA (2020), alongside data on implemented public health measures were analyzed. RESULTS There were three waves (n = 3169 outbreaks; 61 650 individuals). The first was led by healthcare settings, the second leisure/entertainment and the third workplaces followed by other settings where the trajectory was equally distributed amongst essential workplaces, non-essential workplaces, schools and non-essential healthcare.Non-acute healthcare, essential and non-essential workplace experienced more outbreaks compared to education, entertainment, large-group-living and social gatherings.Schools experienced 11% of identified outbreaks, yet involved just 4% of total cases. Conversely, adult-education outbreaks (2%) had disproportionately more cases (9%). CONCLUSION Our findings suggest schools were not the key driver of the latest wave in infections. School re-opening coinciding with returning to work may have accounted for the parallel rise in outbreaks in those settings suggesting contact-points outside school being more likely to seed in-school outbreaks than contact points within school as the wave of outbreaks in all other settings occurred either prior to or simultaneously with the schools wave.School re-opening is a priority but requires mitigation measures to do so safely including staggering opening of different settings whilst maintaining low levels of community transmission.","Lakha, F; King, A; Swinkels, K; Lee, A C K",Journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34179987/,251

CASE REPORT We present a case of a 29-year-old woman who was brought by family members to our Emergency Department (ED) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia with sudden cardiac arrest due to SCAD in the right coronary artery 13 days after normal spontaneous vaginal delivery. The patient was brought in with no cardiopulmonary resuscitation for 20 min. She was resuscitated successfully in the ED. Her initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation (VF). Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) was performed during pulse checks, which revealed no signs of right ventricular strain nor signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). After that, she underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention, which confirmed the diagnosis of right coronary artery dissection. The patient was successfully managed and discharged from the hospital after 18 days. She was independent and in good health after 4 months of follow-up.

121365,Targeting Natural Products for the Treatment of COVID-19 - An Updated Review.,2020-09-03,"Providing guidance during a Visual Analytics session can support analysts in pursuing their goals more efficiently. However, the effectiveness of guidance depends on many factors: Determining the right timing to provide it is one of them. Although in complex analysis scenarios choosing the right timing could make the difference between a dependable and a superfluous guidance, an analysis of the literature suggests that this problem did not receive enough attention. In this paper, we describe a methodology to determine moments in which guidance is needed. Our assumption is that the need of guidance would influence the user state-of-mind, as in distress situations during the analytical process, and we hypothesize that such moments could be identified by analyzing the user's facial expressions. We propose a framework composed by a facial recognition software and a machine learning model trained to detect when to provide guidance according to changes of the user facial expressions. We trained the model by interviewing several analysts during their work and ranked multiple facial features based on their relative importance in determining the need of guidance. Finally, we show that by applying only minor modifications to its architecture, our prototype was able to detect a need of guidance on the fly and made our methodology well suited also for real-time analysis sessions. The results of our evaluations show that our methodology is indeed effective in determining when a need of guidance is present, which constitutes a prerequisite to providing timely and effective guidance in VA.","Ceneda, Davide; Arleo, Alessio; Gschwandtner, Theresia; Miksch, Silvia",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2021.3094870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34232881/,251

Objectives To assess changes in audiometric hearing thresholds between pre-treatment values and two weeks into therapy. To document observed changes, and occurrence of ototoxicity within the period. Methods Prospective analytical cohort study on drug-resistant tuberculosis patients. Basic demographic parameters were taken. Three-point audiometric assessments within two weeks into therapy were done. Percentage of patients with ototoxicity were calculated. Pure tone threshold changes between the three audiometric values were compared. Results Audiograms of 53 patients comprising 56.6% males; age range was 13 to 91 years. Both air and bone conduction hearing thresholds significantly worsened between baseline and one week into therapy (p=0.011, and 0.015 respectively), and between baseline and two weeks into therapy (p=0.003 and 0.042 respectively).

This case series highlights the need for awareness of fogging and improper face mask fit as causes of standard automated perimetry artifacts in patients with ocular hypertension and glaucoma. CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS Six patients with the diagnosis of ocular hypertension, glaucoma suspect, or glaucoma underwent standard automated perimetry (24-2 or 10-2 SITA, Humphrey Field Analyzer) while wearing ear-loop surgical face masks. Due to patient complaints of fogging during the testing, low test reliability, and unexpected results, the tests were repeated after taping securely the mask to the bridge of the nose. CLINICAL FINDINGS Fogging may reduce visual field (VF) test reliability and induce artifacts that mimic glaucomatous defects. VF test reliability can be improved and artifacts minimized following mask taping. In 1 case there was worsening of VF defects after mask taping. This suggests that fogging may also disguise true VF defects. CONCLUSIONS Fogging can result in unreliable VF testing with glaucoma-like artifacts. Secure taping of the face mask to the nose bridge may minimize this problem and reduce unnecessary additional testing and follow-up visits.","El-Nimri, Nevin W; Moghimi, Sasan; Fingeret, Murray; Weinreb, Robert N",Journal of glaucoma,https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000001706; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33116056/,251

For pre-neoadjuvant treatment mrEMVI, pooled hazard ratio (HR) estimate for DFS was 2.30 (95%CI 1.54-3.44) for higher recurrence in mrEMVI-positive patients. mrEMVI-positive patients were found to have a lower OS with a pooled HR of 1.68 (95%CI 1.27-2.22). Pooled risk ratio (RR) for synchronous metastasis was 4.11 (95%CI 2.80-6.02) for mrEMVI-positivity. For post-neoadjuvant treatment EMVI (ymrEMVI), positive status showed a lower DFS with a pooled HR of 2.04 (95%CI 1.55-2.69). RR of having a positive resection margin status was 2.95 (95%CI 1.75-4.98) for ymrEMVI-positive patients. CONCLUSION This review showed that oncologic outcomes are significantly worse for both pre- and post-neoadjuvant treatment mrEMVI-positive patients. MRI-detected EMVI should be consistently reported in rectal cancer staging and may provide guidance for the targeted use of additional systemic therapy.","Fournier, François Rouleau; Motamedi, Ali; Brown, Carl J; Phang, Terry; Raval, Manoj; Hague, Cameron J; Karimuddin, Ahmer A",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33491979/,251

For therapeutic angiogenesis therapy, apheresis was initially performed using Auto PBSC mode (N = 4) to fine tune the blood product volume to omit cell concentration, but the collected number of mononuclear cells was lower than expected. However, an increase of the harvest cycle number from 3.8 ± 0.5 to 7.4 ± 2.0 cycles (N = 19) resulted in a 2.1-fold higher number of collected mononuclear cells (8.7 ± 4.1 × 109 vs. 4.1 ± 1.0 × 109 cells, P < 0.05). The increase in blood product volume by this modification appeared to be lower than that expected with MNC mode.

Here we investigate the relationship between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop region polymorphisms, mtDNA haplotype and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as well as the correlation of D-loop variants and clinical characteristics of PCOS, in a Chinese population. The mtDNA D-Loop of whole blood samples from 421 PCOS patients and 409 controls underwent next generation sequencing. The variants G207A (PBH＜0.05), 16036GGins (PBH＜0.05) and 16049Gins (PBH＜0.001) were associated with decreased risk of PCOS. No variants were associated with PCOS, and within the PCOS group, no statistical significance was found between D-loop polymorphisms and clinical characteristics. Patient haplotype was identified from D-Loop single nucleotide polymorphisms and analysis suggested that haplotype A15 (P adjusted ＜0.01) was significantly associated with decreased risk of PCOS. In conclusion, mtDNA D-loop alterations and haplotype appear to confer resistance to PCOS in Chinese women.","Deng, Xiaohong; Ji, Dongmei; Li, Xinyuan; Xu, Yuping; Cao, Yu; Zou, Weiwei; Liang, Chunmei; Lee Marley, Jordan; Zhang, Zhiguo; Wei, Zhaolian; Zhou, Ping; Liu, Yajing; Cao, Yunxia",Mitochondrion,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mito.2020.12.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385542/,251

We describe recent evidence examining the benefits and harms associated with their use. RECENT FINDINGS The environmental harms associated with desflurane and nitrous oxide likely outweigh any purported clinical benefits. Life cycle analyses are beginning to address the many gaps in our understanding, and informing choices made on all aspects of anaesthetic care. There is, however, an urgent need to move beyond the debate about anaesthetic technique A vs. B and focus also on areas such as sustainable procurement, waste management, pharmacological stewardship and joined-up solutions. SUMMARY There is now compelling evidence that anaesthetists, departments and hospitals should avoid desflurane completely, and limit nitrous oxide use to settings where there is no viable alternative, as their environmental harms outweigh any perceived clinical benefit. Life cycle analyses seem supportive of total intravenous and/or regional anaesthesia. There are many other areas where choices can be made by individual anaesthetists that contribute towards reducing the environmental burden of healthcare, such as prioritising the reduction of inappropriate resource use and over-treatment. However, this all requires joined up solutions where all parts of an organisation engage.","Lopes, Rita; Shelton, Cliff; Charlesworth, Mike",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000001009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33958528/,251

One of the clearest examples has been the drastic reduction in paediatric emergency departments visits during the pandemic (1). But we have also observed another very interesting and unexpected phenomenon in our Italian hospital.

In the present study, we revealed a novel function of CAV-1 in inhibiting glycosylation of other molecules in murine breast cancer cell line. After the silencing of CAV-1, we found that the mRNA and protein expressions of cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) and its related molecules (MCT4, matrix metalloproteinase MMP2 and MMP9) increased in the breast cancer cells. Meanwhile, the migration and invasion of the breast cancer cells were significantly enhanced assessed by cell wound healing experiment and transwell assays. Further, the gelatin zymography and lactate assay in the cells also showed the strengthened enzyme activity of MMP9 and the increased extracellular lactate concentration, respectively, after the silencing of CAV-1. Notably, the glycosylation level of CD147 overtly increased after the inhibition of CAV-1 detected by Western Blot analysis, whereas upregulation of CAV-1 did the opposite. Therefore, the findings suggest that the downregulation of CAV-1 can promote breast cancer cell progression probably by highly glycosylated CD147.","Wu, Qingzhen; Zhang, Chao; He, Juan; Wang, Che; Hu, Xiao; Li, Ning; Zou, Huiru; Qin, Junfang; Yuan, Mengci; Wang, Yue",Anti-cancer drugs,https://doi.org/10.1097/cad.0000000000001036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33587355/,251

OBJECTIVES Although COM remains a common ear disease requiring surgical intervention, its re-operation risks are less well-documented. This study aimed to compare patients with COM who underwent re-operation and those patients with no re-operation, and identify the risks of re-operation. METHOD This retrospective cohort study analyzed the trend of COM surgery from 1999-2009, and identified the re-operation risks of 18 895 patients with COM who underwent surgery from 2002-2006 using the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. RESULTS Among the study population, 129 patients underwent revision surgery during a 5.5 ± 1.5 year follow-up period. A univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the re-operation rate was significantly higher in patients under 18 years of age, those with mastoiditis, disorders of external ear, treatment by surgeons of 50-64 years of age, use of a very high volume surgeon, and combined surgery with mastoidectomy. A multivariate analysis further limited the re-operation risk factors to younger patients, those with mastoiditis, external ear disorders, treatment by older surgeons, and concomitant mastoidectomy.","Yeh, Chien-Fu; Wu, Chuan-Song; Huang, Chii-Yuan; Tang, Chao-Hsiun; Kuo, Ting-Yu; Tu, Tzong-Yang",Acta oto-laryngologica,https://doi.org/10.3109/00016489.2015.1115550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26623993/,251

A new symmetrical tip has been invented promising efficient haemodialysis even if the ports are reversed. OBJECTIVE To evaluate access recirculation of the 'palindrome' catheter and to report initial experiences in a clinical setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS After implantation of the new catheter in 20 patients (male: 14; female: 6; mean age 72 ± 12.2), access recirculation was evaluated using the urea-based recirculation test. After 30 minutes of haemodialysis, ultrafiltration was stopped and arterial and venous samples were taken. Afterwards, the blood flow rate was reduced to 120 ml/min. Another systemic arterial blood sample was taken 10 seconds after the blood pump was switched off. RESULTS All 20 interventions were performed successfully without complications. The average recirculation rate was 8.1% with a median of 2.5% ranging from 0 to 85.8%. Recirculation rates under 5% were measured in 13 patients and more than 10% recirculation were found in two patients. The median of days between catheter implantation and recirculation assessment was the day following implantation. CONCLUSION The new symmetrical catheter presented low recirculation rates in a clinical setting. Since there is just a single tip, fluoroscopic placement in the right atrium is facilitated.","Jonczyk, Martin; Althoff, Christian; Slowinski, Torsten; Lieker, Ina; Naik, Marcel; Auer, Jonas; Marcos, Raúl García; Duka, Ejona; Hamm, Bernd; de Bucourt, Maximilian",Journal of renal care,https://doi.org/10.1111/jorc.12210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28815975/,251

There are many reports on potential risk factors for severe disease, but few reports have reported a relationship between antibody titer and severity in Japan. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is one such factor theorized to affect the worsening of disease. We have been evaluating IgG responses in COVID-19 patients at our tertiary hospital. A measure of interest is the IgG index, we assigned 1.4 as the cutoff value for a positive result according to the manufacturer indication and observed that patients could be categorised into two distinct groups: early elevation of IgG and late elevation of IgG (IgG elevated in the first 7 days ± 2 days or more than 10 days after symptom onset). We defined the former as early-IgG responders (N=7) and the latter as late-IgG responders (N=14) and compared them. C-reactive protein and D-dimer levels were significantly higher on admission (HD 0) and the respiratory rate was higher, lymphocytes were lower significantly on day 7 of hospitalization (HD 7) in the early-IgG responders. These results might implicate that early production of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 IgG may be associated with clinical indicator for severity.","Maeda, Tadashi; Kashiwagi, Katsuhito; Yoshizawa, Sadako; Sato, Takahiro; Aoki, Kotaro; Ishii, Yoshikazu; Tateda, Kazuhiro",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.7883/yoken.jjid.2020.799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33642431/,251

Preoperative use of the Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System (SURPAS) providing individualized risk assessment, may enhance informed consent. We assessed patient and provider perceptions of SURPAS as a risk assessment tool. Methods A convergent mixed-methods study assessed SURPAS's trial implementation, concurrently collecting quantitative and qualitative data, separately analyzing it, and integrating the results. Patients and providers were surveyed and interviewed on their opinion of how SURPAS impacted the preoperative encounter. Relationships between patient risk and patient and provider assessment of SURPAS were examined. Results A total of 197 patients were provided their SURPAS postoperative risk estimates in nine surgeon's clinics. Of the total patients, 98.8% reported they understood their surgical risks very or quite well after exposure to SURPAS; 92.7% reported SURPAS was very helpful or helpful. Providers shared that 83.4% of the time they reported SURPAS was very or somewhat helpful; 44.7% of the time the providers reported it changed their interaction with the patient and this change was beneficial 94.3% of the time. As patient risk increased, providers reported that SURPAS was increasingly helpful (p < 0.0001). Conclusions Patients and providers reported the use of SURPAS helpful and informative during the preoperative risk assessment of patients, thus improving the surgical decision making process. Patients thought that SURPAS was helpful regardless of their risk level, whereas providers thought that SURPAS was more helpful in higher risk patients.","Bronsert, Michael R; Lambert-Kerzner, Anne; Henderson, William G; Hammermeister, Karl E; Atuanya, Chisom; Aasen, Davis M; Singh, Abhinav B; Meguid, Robert A",Patient safety in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13037-020-00256-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724336/,251

This paper aims to review and report contemporary knowledge and practice regarding feasibility and outcomes of simultaneous vestibular schwannoma resection and cochlear implantation to serve as a reference and guide for future surgery and studies. METHODS The current literature was searched systematically according to the PRISMA guidelines and after criteria-based selection, 29 studies were identified, including a total of 86 patients who had undergone surgical resection of a vestibular schwannoma and subsequent cochlear implantation in a single procedure. RESULTS The postoperative outcomes were reported with a high degree of heterogeneity, hindering a proper meta-analysis. However, pooling those cases with reported speech discrimination outcomes demonstrated mean scores equivalent to moderate-to-high performance. A few cases had no audibility. A positive cochlear nerve test result was not a secure positive predictor of success. Complications were rare.

Given the sociopolitical roots of widening occupational, social, and health inequities, it is imperative that occupational therapy move forward in mobilizing occupation for social transformation. PURPOSE. Three key aims are addressed: articulating the imperative to mobilize occupation for social transformation; highlighting the political nature of occupation and occupational therapy; and providing guideposts for embracing a radical sensibility to inform moving forward in mobilizing occupation for social transformation. KEY ISSUES. Conditions of possibility within occupational therapy leave the profession ill equipped to enact social transformation. Enacting calls to mobilize occupation for social transformation requires radically reconfiguring these conditions of possibility to inform practices that resist, disrupt, and re-configure sociopolitical conditions perpetuating occupational inequities. IMPLICATIONS. Mobilizing occupation for social transformation holds much potential to contribute toward creating more equitable, humane societies. Realizing this potential involves committing to transforming our profession, as well as societal discourses, structures, systems, relations, and practices.","Rudman, Debbie Laliberte",Canadian journal of occupational therapy.

They are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of the Coronaviridae family. Proteases of SARS-CoV-2 are necessary for viral replication, structural assembly, and pathogenicity. The approximately 33.8 kDa M pro protease of SARS-CoV-2 is a non-human homologue and is highly conserved among several coronaviruses, indicating that M pro could be a potential drug target for Coronaviruses. Methods: Herein, we performed computational ligand screening of four pharmacophores (OEW, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and N3) that are presumed to have positive effects against SARS-CoV-2 M pro protease (6LU7), and also screened 50,000 natural compounds from the ZINC Database dataset against this protease target. Results: We found 40 pharmacophore-like structures of natural compounds from diverse chemical classes that exhibited better affinity of docking as compared to the known ligands. The 11 best selected ligands, namely ZINC1845382, ZINC1875405, ZINC2092396, ZINC2104424, ZINC44018332, ZINC2101723, ZINC2094526, ZINC2094304, ZINC2104482, ZINC3984030, and ZINC1531664, are mainly classified as beta-carboline, alkaloids, and polyflavonoids, and all displayed interactions with dyad CYS145 and HIS41 from the protease pocket in a similar way as other known ligands. Conclusions: Our results suggest that these 11 molecules could be effective against SARS-CoV-2 protease and may be subsequently tested in vitro and in vivo to develop novel drugs against this virus.","Silva Andrade, Bruno; Ghosh, Preetam; Barh, Debmalya; Tiwari, Sandeep; José Santana Silva, Raner; Rodrigues de Assis Soares, Wagner; Silva Melo, Tarcisio; Santos Freitas, Andria; González-Grande, Patrícia; Sousa Palmeira, Lucas; Carlos Junior Alcantara, Luiz; Giovanetti, Marta; Góes-Neto, Aristóteles; Ariston de Carvalho Azevedo, Vasco",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.23829.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447372/,251
124766,Therapeutic agents against COVID-19 with clinical evidence.,2021-01-14,"RNA viruses synthesize new genomes in the infected host thanks to dedicated, virally-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). As such, these enzymes are prime targets for antiviral therapy, as has recently been demonstrated for hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, peculiarities in the architecture and dynamics of RdRps raise fundamental questions about access to their active site during RNA polymerization. Here, we used molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, starting from the available crystal structures of HCV NS5B in ternary complex with template-primer duplexes and nucleotides, to address the question of ribonucleotide entry into the active site of viral RdRp. Tracing the possible passage of incoming UTP or GTP through the RdRp-specific entry tunnel, we found two successive checkpoints that regulate nucleotide traffic to the active site. We observed that a magnesium-bound nucleotide first binds next to the tunnel entry, and interactions with the triphosphate moiety orient it such that its base moiety enters first. Dynamics of RdRp motifs F1 + F3 then allow the nucleotide to interrogate the RNA template base prior to nucleotide insertion into the active site. These dynamics are finely regulated by a second magnesium dication, thus coordinating the entry of a magnesium-bound nucleotide with shuttling of the second magnesium necessary for the two-metal ion catalysis. The findings of our work suggest that at least some of these features are general to viral RdRps and provide further details on the original nucleotide selection mechanism operating in RdRps of RNA viruses.","Ben Ouirane, Kaouther; Boulard, Yves; Bressanelli, Stéphane",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra118.005209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867194/,251

Cholesterol levels in the brain are tightly regulated for physiological brain function, but mounting evidence indicates that excessive cholesterol accumulates in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where it may drive AD-associated pathological changes. This seems especially relevant for late-onset AD, as several of the major genetic risk factors are functionally associated with cholesterol metabolism. In this review we discuss the different systems that maintain brain cholesterol metabolism in the healthy brain, and how dysregulation of these processes can lead, or contribute to, Alzheimer's disease. We will also discuss how AD-risk genes might impact cholesterol metabolism and downstream AD pathology. Finally, we will address the major outstanding questions in the field and how recent technical advances in CRISPR/Cas9-gene editing and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-technology can aid to study these problems.","Feringa, Femke M; van der Kant, Rik",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2021.690372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248607/,251

In contrast to the regulation of calcium concentration, little is known about the spatio-temporal regulation of ROCK activity in live blood vessels. Here, we report ROCK activation in subcutaneous arterioles in a transgenic mouse line, which expresses a genetically-encoded ROCK biosensor based on the principle of Fӧrster resonance energy transfer by two-photon excitation in vivo imaging. Upon laser ablation of arterioles, rapid vasospasm was induced, concomitant with a transient increase in calcium concentration in arteriolar smooth muscles. Unlike the increase in calcium concentration, vasoconstriction and ROCK activation continued for several minutes. Both the ROCK inhibitor, fasudil, and the ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor blocker, hexamethonium, inhibited laser-induced ROCK activation and reduced the duration of vasospasm at the segments distant from the irradiated point. These observations suggest that vasoconstriction is initially triggered by a rapid surge of cytoplasmic calcium concentration and then maintained by sympathetic nerve-mediated ROCK activation.","Imanishi, Ayako; Ichise, Hiroshi; Fan, Chuyun; Nakagawa, Yasuaki; Kuwahara, Koichiro; Sumiyama, Kenta; Matsuda, Michiyuki; Terai, Kenta",The American journal of pathology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2020.09.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069718/,251

Methods: A total of 36 patients (20 males, 16 females, aged from 14 to 74 years old) who underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from November 2018 to April 2019 were enrolled into the retrospective study, including 11 cases of ECRSwNP, 15 cases of non-ECRSwNP and 10 cases in control group (deviation of nasal septum). The patients were divided into allergic rhinitis and non-allergic rhinitis groups, atopy and non-atopy groups according to whether patients in the experimental group and control group had allergic rhinitis and atopy. HE staining was performed for histological assessment of CRSwNP which was classfied as ECRSwNP and non-ECRSwNP. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to determine the positive localization and semi-quantitative expression level of galectin-10 protein in ERSwNP, non-ECRSwNP and control groups. The expression levels of galectin-10 protein in three groups were determined by Western Blot. The expression levels of galectin-10 mRNA in three groups were determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Analyzing the correlation between the expression of galectin-10 and clinical factors including the allergic rhinitis and atopy, SPSS 19.0 software and Graphpad prism 7.0 were used for statistical analysis and mapping. Results: By using IHC method, it was found that galectin-10 was mainly localized in eosinophils in the polyp tissues. The semi-quantitative expression of the galectin-10 in the ECRSwNP group (0.051±0.003) was significantly higher than that of non-ECRSwNP (0.028±0.004) and control groups (0.025±0.004, t value was 3.862 and 5.137, both P<0.01). There was no significant difference between the control and non-ECRSwNP groups (t=0.560, P>0.05). The expression of galectin-10 in the ECRSwNP group was significantly higher than that of non-ECRSwNP and control groups (t value was 25.351 and 27.376, both P<0.01). However, there was no significant difference between the non-ECRSwNP and control groups (t=1.071, P>0.05). Compared with the non-ECRSwNP (1.188±0.054) and control groups (1.020±0.142), the expression of galectin-10 mRNA was higher in the ECRSwNP group (2.413±0.303), the differences were significant (t value was 3.973 and 4.156, both P<0.05). There was no significant difference between the non-ECRSwNP and control groups (t=1.110, P>0.05). There was no significant difference in the expression of galectin-10 between the allergic rhinitis group and the non-allergic rhinitis group (all P>0.05), so as to the atopy group and non-atopy group(all P>0.05). Conclusion: The expression level of galectin-10 is elevated in ECRSwNP, and not influenced by allergic status, suggesting that galectin-10 may be a new biomarker for ECRSwNP and play an important role in the pathogenesis of ECRSwNP.","Li, C H; Liu, X; Wu, W X; Wang, Y J; Ai, Y F; Liu, H B",Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn115330-20200306-00168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911886/,251

RESULTS A total of 203 LDCTs were performed in 121 patients who met eligibility for LDCT and had appropriate surveillance from 2015 to 2019. The average age was 64 years old. The overall adherence rate for prescribed LDCTs was 59.1%. Patients with Lung-RADS score 2 had 2.43 times higher odds of adherence relative to patients with Lung-RADS score 1 (odds ratio [OR]=2.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-4.83; P=0.011). African American patients had 42% lower odds of adherence relative to white patients (OR=0.58; 95% CI: 0.32-1.06; P=0.076). Patients with non-District of Columbia zip codes had 57% higher odds of adherence relative to those with District of Columbia zip codes, although this did not reach statistical significance (OR=1.57; 95% CI: 0.87-2.82; P=0.136). CONCLUSIONS Despite the implementation of a multidisciplinary, academic LDCT screening program, overall adherence rate to prescribed follow-up scans was suboptimal. Socioeconomic disparities and African American race may negatively affect adherence to lung cancer screening LDCT guidelines. Patients with concerning findings on initial LDCT had a higher association of adherence to guidelines.","Mortman, Keith D; Devlin, Joseph; Giang, Brian; Mortman, Ryan; Sparks, Andrew D; Napolitano, Michael A",American journal of clinical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1097/coc.0000000000000817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33795600/,251

Further resistance markers are largely unknown and would help for better stratification. METHODS Clinical data and methylation profiles from the NOA-08 (104, elderly glioblastoma) and the EORTC 26101 (297, glioblastoma) studies and 398 patients with glioblastoma from the Heidelberg Neuro-Oncology center have been analyzed focused on the predictive effect of DNA damage response (DDR) gene methylation. Candidate genes were validated in vitro. RESULTS Twenty-eight glioblastoma 5'-cytosine-phosphat-guanine-3' (CpGs) from 17 DDR genes negatively correlated with expression and were used together with telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations in further analysis. CpG methylation of DDR genes shows highest association with the mesenchymal (MES) and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) II glioblastoma subgroup. MES tumors have lower tumor purity compared to RTK I and II subgroup tumors. CpG hypomethylation of DDR genes TP73 and PRPF19 correlated with worse patient survival in particular in MGMT promoter unmethylated tumors. TERT promoter mutation is most frequent in RTK I and II subtypes and associated with worse survival. Primary glioma cells show methylation patterns that resemble RTK I and II glioblastoma and long term established glioma cell lines do not match with glioblastoma subtypes. Silencing of selected resistance genes PRPF19 and TERT increase sensitivity to temozolomide in vitro. CONCLUSION Hypomethylation of DDR genes and TERT promoter mutations is associated with worse tumor prognosis, dependent on the methylation cluster and MGMT promoter methylation status in IDH wild-type glioblastoma.","Kessler, Tobias; Berberich, Anne; Sadik, Ahmed; Sahm, Felix; Gorlia, Thierry; Meisner, Christoph; Hoffmann, Dirk C; Wick, Antje; Kickingereder, Philipp; Rübmann, Petra; Bendszus, Martin; Opitz, Christiane; Weller, Michael; van den Bent, Martin; Stupp, Roger; Winkler, Frank; Brandes, Alba; von Deimling, Andreas; Platten, Michael; Wick, Wolfgang",Cancer medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.3447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991787/,251

The aim of this study is to explore the correlation between serum bilirubin level and mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).Patients admitted with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in our hospital between January 2015 and January 2018 were enrolled in this study. Clinical and laboratory data of 361 patients were retrospectively collected to explore the independent risk factors of mortality.The comparison of baseline characteristics showed that non-survivors had lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (P < .001) and higher level of serum total bilirubin (TBIL) (P < .001) and direct bilirubin (DBIL) (P < .001). We found that only GCS (P < .001), glucose (P < .001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P = .042) and DBIL (P = .005) were significant risk factors in multivariate logistic regression analysis. GCS and DBIL had comparable AUC value (0.778 vs 0.750, P > .05) on predicting mortality in TBI patients. The AUC value of the combination of GCS and DBIL is higher than the single value of these two factors (P < .05). Moreover, predictive model 1 consisted of GCS, glucose, LDH and DBIL had the highest AUC value of 0.894.DBIL is a significant risk factor of mortality in TBI patients. Assessing the level of DBIL is beneficial for physicians to evaluate severity and predict outcome for TBI patients.","Wang, Ruoran; He, Min; Xu, Jianguo",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000021020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629724/,251

Currently, no vaccine or effective treatment exists for RSV. The RSV G glycoprotein mediates viral attachment to cells and contributes to pathogenesis by modulating host immunity through interactions with the human chemokine receptor CX3CR1. Antibodies targeting the RSV G central conserved domain are protective in both prophylactic and post-infection animal models. Here we describe the crystal structure of the broadly-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody 3G12 bound to the RSV G central conserved domain. Antibody 3G12 binds to a conformational epitope composed of highly conserved residues, explaining its broad neutralization activity. Surprisingly, RSV G complexed with 3G12 adopts a distinct conformation not observed in previously described RSV G-antibody structures. Comparison to other structures reveals that the RSV G central conserved domain is flexible and can adopt multiple conformations in the regions flanking the cysteine noose. We also show that restriction of RSV G flexibility with a proline mutation abolishes binding to antibody 3G12 but not antibody 3D3, which recognizes a different conformation of RSV G. Our studies provide new insights for rational vaccine design, indicating the importance of preserving both the global structural integrity of antigens and local conformational flexibility at antigenic sites, which may elicit a more diverse antibody response and broader protection against infection and disease.IMPORTANCE Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes severe respiratory infections in infants, young children, and the elderly, and currently no licensed vaccine exists. In this study, we describe the crystal structure of the RSV surface glycoprotein G in complex with a broadly-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody. The antibody binds to RSV G at a highly conserved region stabilized by two disulfide bonds, but it captures RSV G in a conformation not previously observed, revealing that this region is both structured and flexible. Importantly, our findings provide insight for the design of vaccines that elicit diverse antibodies, which may provide broad protection from infection and disease.","Fedechkin, Stanislav O; George, Natasha L; Nuñez Castrejon, Ana M; Dillen, Joshua R; Kauvar, Lawrence M; DuBois, Rebecca M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01879-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31852779/,251

Upper respiratory tract infections were positively correlated with the incidences of influenza A, B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses (types 1-3 combined). Lower respiratory tract infections were positively correlated with only the incidence of RSV. Both upper and lower respiratory tract infections were negatively correlated with relative humidity. Asthma admissions were negatively correlated with maximum temperature and positively correlated with the incidence of influenza B and increasing hours of sunshine. Although sporadic cases of adenovirus infection were identified, not enough cases were available for a more detailed analysis. Gastroenteritis and urinary tract infections, included as control diseases, were not correlated significantly with any climate parameters. These correlations are compatible with current understanding of respiratory virus survival under certain climate conditions and may assist the prediction of disease burdens and hospital resource planning in such tropical environments.","Loh, T P; Lai, F Y L; Tan, E S; Thoon, K C; Tee, N W S; Cutter, J; Tang, J W",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268810002955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21226981/,251

Health and wellness coaching promotes healthy behavior change as a means of averting or mitigating chronic lifestyle-related diseases and is a potential treatment for burnout and stress management. Coaches help clients enhance self-motivation, identify strengths, and implement a framework for change by applying psychological resources, including mindfulness, positive mind-set, resilience, self-efficacy, and self-awareness. The framework of coaching is built upon psychological safety, mindfulness, accountability, and the coach-client relationship.

It leaves the distal end of the injured nerve intact for further reconstruction. Despite encouraging clinical results, only few experimental studies have been published to enhance the regeneration results of the procedure. We examined the influence of different size epineural windows and degree of axonal injury of STS repair on nerve regeneration and donor nerve morbidity. METHODS Three clinically relevant repair techniques of the transected common peroneal nerve (CPN) were compared. Group A: 10-mm long epineural STS windows; group B: 2-mm long windows and partial axotomy to the donor tibial nerve; and group C: 2-mm long windows with axotomies to both nerves. Regeneration was followed by the walk track analysis, nerve morphometry, histology, and wet muscle mass calculations. RESULTS The results of the walk track analysis were significantly better in groups B and C compared with group A. The nerve fiber count, total fiber area, fiber density, and percentage of the fiber area values of CPN of the group C were significantly higher when compared with group A. The wet mass ratio of the CPN-innervated anterior tibial muscle was significantly higher in group C compared with group A. The wet mass ratio of the tibial nerve-innervated gastrocnemial muscle was higher in group A compared with the other groups. CONCLUSIONS All three variations of the STS repair technique showed nerve regeneration. Deliberate donor nerve axotomy enhanced nerve regeneration. A larger epineural window did not compensate the effect of axonal trauma on nerve regeneration.","Rönkkö, Henrikki; Göransson, Harry; Taskinen, Hanna-Stiina; Paavilainen, Pasi; Vahlberg, Tero; Röyttä, Matias",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

This technique involves a wide excision of the levator muscles that could reduce the high incidence of circumferential margin positivity associated with conventional abdominoperineal resections. We present our technique of robotic cylindrical abdominoperineal resection where the daVinci robot is used to perform a controlled transection of the levator muscles transabdominally under direct visualization. METHODS Five patients with rectal adenocarcinoma within 5 cm of the anal verge underwent robot-assisted cylindrical abdominoperineal resection. Safety, feasibility, immediate postoperative outcomes, and pathological adequacy of the specimen were assessed. RESULTS The procedure was successfully completed in all 5 patients without any intraoperative complications, robot-associated morbidity, or conversion to the open approach. The mean operative time and length of hospital stay were 343 minutes and 5.8 days. An intact mesorectal envelope and negative circumferential margin was achieved in all cases. All specimens had a cylindrical shape. CONCLUSIONS Robotic assistance enables the transabdominal transection of the levator muscles in cylindrical abdominoperineal resection, with acceptable perioperative and pathological outcomes. Further studies are essential to objectively define the safety, efficacy, and long-term results of this new technique.","Marecik, Slawomir J; Zawadzki, Marek; Desouza, Ashwin L; Park, John J; Abcarian, Herand; Prasad, Leela M",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcr.0b013e31822720a2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21904149/,251

They combine the potential of mRNA to encode for almost any protein with an excellent safety profile and a flexible production process. During the last decade, the mRNA vaccine approach has been increasingly recognized and viewed as a versatile tool for the development of new innovative therapeutics not only in infectious disease settings but also in cancer. mRNA vaccines traditionally consist of a messenger RNA synthesized by in vitro transcription using a bacteriophage RNA polymerase and a template DNA that encodes the antigen(s) of interest. Once administered and internalized by host cells, the mRNA transcripts are translated directly in the cytoplasm of the cell. The resulting antigens are presented to the immune system cells to stimulate an immune response. Dendritic cells (DCs) can be utilized as a carrier by delivering tumor-associated antigen mRNAs or total tumor RNA to their cytoplasm; then, the mRNA-loaded DCs can be delivered to the host to elicit a specific immune response. Recently, 2 mRNA vaccines were approved for the first time for human use-to prevent COVID-19 infection-bringing excitement for the future possibilities of this approach for cancer immunotherapy as well as for preventing other infectious diseases.","Copur, Mehmet",Oncology,https://doi.org/10.46883/onc.2021.3504.0198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33893760/,251

To determine whether the PDA is hemodynamically significant (HSDA), several echocardiographic parameters have been suggested, including retrograde diastolic blood flow in the descending aorta (Dao). OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of an HSDA, including retrograde diastolic flow in the Dao, on regional tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2) and extraction measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). METHODS This is a prospective observational cohort study in which we included preterm infants (GA <32 weeks) who underwent echocardiographic screening because of clinical signs of an HSDA within 2 weeks after birth. We measured cerebral and renal rSO2 on the day of echocardiography. HSDA was diagnosed if left-to-right shunting through the PDA was accompanied by left atrial-to-aortic root ratio >1.4 and/or left pulmonary artery end-diastolic flow velocity >0.2 m/s and/or retrograde diastolic blood flow in the Dao. RESULTS Forty-nine infants were included, with a median GA of 27.6 weeks (IQR: 26.1-29.0), birth weight of 980 g (IQR: 800-1,200), and postnatal age of 77 h (IQR: 70-107). Infants with a closed duct (n = 11), a non-HSDA (n = 18), and an HSDA (n = 20) had similar cerebral and renal NIRS measurements. Retrograde diastolic blood flow in the Dao, present in 11 infants with PDA, also did not affect cerebral and renal NIRS measurements. CONCLUSION In preterm infants with clinical signs of an HSDA within 2 weeks after birth, cerebral and renal oxygen saturation and extraction are not affected by an HSDA or by retrograde diastolic blood flow in the Dao.","van der Laan, Michelle E; Roofthooft, Marcus T R; Fries, Marian W A; Berger, Rolf M F; Schat, Trijntje E; van Zoonen, Anne G J F; Tanis, Jozien C; Bos, Arend F; Kooi, Elisabeth M W",Neonatology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000445101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27088709/,251

130912,Evaluation of respiratory viral pathogens in acute asthma exacerbations during childhood.,2011,"INTRODUCTION Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are often under-recognized in the community. MCI/ADRD screening could offer benefits such as early treatment, research participation, lifestyle modification, and advanced care planning. To date, there are no clear guidelines regarding the benefits vs. harms of dementia screening or whether a dementia screening program could be successful. METHODS A community-based study was conducted to evaluate an MCI/ADRD screening program and determine what older adults would do with the information. Measures of cognition, physical health, functionality, and mood were collected. Participants met with a health professional, were given screening results with recommendations, and then contacted 60 days later to determine what was done with the results. Logistic regression models were used to build predictive models. RESULTS Participants (n = 288) had a mean age of 71.5±8.3y, mean education of 13.3±4.8y, and were 70% female, 67% White, 26% African American, and 48% Hispanic. After 60 days, 75% of participants were re-contacted; 54% shared results with family, 33% shared results with health care providers (HCPs), and 52% initiated behavioral change. Among participants sharing results with HCPs, 51% reported HCPs did not follow-up on the results, and 18% that HCPs did not show any interest in the screening visit or its results. Predictors of sharing results with HCPs were elevated hemoglobin A1C (OR = 1.85;95%CI:1.19-2.88), uncontrolled hypertension (OR = 2.73;95%CI:1.09-6.83), and mobility issues (OR = 2.43;95%CI: 1.93-5.54). Participant behavioral changes included lifestyle modification (58%), social engagement (10%), cognitive stimulation (5%), and advanced care planning (4%). The most significant predictors of sharing with family were better overall mental health (OR = 0.19; 95%CI: 0.06-0.59) and better physical function (OR = 0.38; 95%CI: 0.17-0.81). DISCUSSION MCI/ADRD screening was well-received by a diverse community sample. Participants showed interest in sharing the results with their family and HCPs and many attempted behavioral change. While HCPs did not always act on screening results, 25% ordered further testing and evaluation. Efforts need to be directed toward (1) increasing self-efficacy of older adults to discuss screening results with their HCPs, and (2) educating HCPs on the value of early detection of MCI/ADRD. Community dementia screening programs can increase MCI/ADRD detection and improve patient-centered outcomes and medical decision-making.","Galvin, James E; Tolea, Magdalena I; Chrisphonte, Stephanie",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609745/,251

Currently, in Germany >140 000 cases of COVID-19 are confirmed. Here we report a nosocomial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the pediatric dialysis unit of the University Hospital Münster (UHM). METHODS Single-step real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs was used to diagnose the index patient and identify infected contacts. Epidemiological links were analyzed by patient interviews and medical record reviews. In addition, each contact was assessed for exposure to the index case and monitored for clinical symptoms. Cycle threshold (Ct) values of all positive test results were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. RESULTS Forty-eight cases were involved in this nosocomial outbreak. Nine contact cases developed laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections. Two SARS-CoV-2-positive cases remained clinically asymptomatic. Eleven cases reported flulike symptoms without positive results. Ct values were significantly lower in cases presenting typical COVID-19 symptoms, suggesting high viral shedding (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS Person-to-person transmission was at the heart of a hospital outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients in the pediatric dialysis unit at UHM. Semiquantitative rRT-PCR results suggest that individuals with high viral load pose a risk to spread SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting. Our epidemiological observation highlights the need to develop strategies to trace and monitor SARS-CoV-2-infected HCWs to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in the hospital setting.","Schwierzeck, Vera; König, Jens Christian; Kühn, Joachim; Mellmann, Alexander; Correa-Martínez, Carlos Luis; Omran, Heymut; Konrad, Martin; Kaiser, Thomas; Kampmeier, Stefanie",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33501962/,251
131308,Intra-oral ignition of monopolar diathermy during transnasal humidified rapid-insufflation ventilatory exchange (THRIVE).,2017,"Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is the most common congenital heart abnormality of fetal origin and is present in approximately ∼25% of the worldwide adult population. PFO is the consequence of failed closure of the foramen ovale, a normal structure that exists in the fetus to direct blood flow directly from the right to the left atrium, bypassing the pulmonary circulation. PFO has historically been associated with an increased risk of stroke, the mechanism of which has been attributed to the paradoxical embolism of venous thrombi that shunt through the PFO directly to the left atrium. However, several studies have failed to show an increased risk of stroke in asymptomatic patients with a PFO, and the risk of stroke recurrence is low in patients who have had a stroke that may be attributed to a PFO. With the advent of transoesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography, as well as transcranial Doppler, a PFO can be routinely detected in clinical practice. Medical treatment with either antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy is recommended. At the current time, closure of the PFO by percutaneous interventional techniques does not appear to reduce the risk of stroke compared to conventional medical treatment, as shown by three large clinical trials. Considerable controversy remains regarding the optimal treatment strategy for patients with both cryptogenic stroke and PFO. This Primer discusses the epidemiology, mechanisms, pathophysiology, diagnosis, screening, management and effects on quality of life of PFO.","Homma, Shunichi; Messé, Steven R; Rundek, Tatjana; Sun, Yee-Ping; Franke, Jennifer; Davidson, Karina; Sievert, Horst; Sacco, Ralph L; Di Tullio, Marco R",Nature reviews.

METHODS The 96 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized at a tertiary center were collected retrospectively. After the exclusion criteria, 46 patients were consisted as the study population. The male and female patients then fill formed the International Prostate Symptom Score and Urinary Symptom Profile respectively. All patients responded to these questions for the three period. RESULTS 27 female (58.6 %) and 19 male (41.4 %) COVID-19 patients answered the questions In the male patients, while there were no statistically significant differences in the total IPSS, the voiding IPSS score, and quality of life between the three periods (p=0.148; p=0.933, p=0.079, respectively), the storage IPSS scores had a significant difference between the three periods (p=0.05). In the female patients, low stream scores, were similar between the three periods (p=0.368). The scores of stress incontinence and an overactive bladder had a significant difference between the three periods (p=0.05 and p=0.05).

There are no objective criteria to guide the surgeon's choice of procedure. This study assesses whether classification and scoring systems can be used in the decision-making process. METHODS One hundred eleven patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for perforated diverticulitis were analyzed. Logistic regression and interaction models were used to determine the predictive value in the two settings. RESULTS Sixty five patients underwent HP and 46 patients underwent PA. Patients with HP had significantly higher scores, median age, and were more often on immunosuppressive medication. Mortality and surgical morbidity did not differ between the groups. The clinical anastomotic leak rate was 28.3% in the PA group. In the univariate logistic regression for in-hospital death, all scores showed a significant influence. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and American Society of Anesthesiologists score had a significant influence on mortality. Each score was analyzed for its predictive value regarding mortality and morbidity with respect to type of operative procedure. Only CCI revealed a trend towards statistical significance. The risk of death increases with increasing CCI when PA is performed compared to HP. CONCLUSION None of the tested scores can be used to help the surgeon decide whether a PA or HP is appropriate in a specific patient. Comorbidity, represented as CCI in this study, might be more important than the locoregional situation.","Pasternak, Itai; Dietrich, Michael; Woodman, Richard; Metzger, Urs; Wattchow, David A; Zingg, Urs",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-009-0852-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20091171/,251

Pulmonary embolism is associated with deep venous thrombosis and also with significant rates of morbidity and mortality. This study examined risk factors for pulmonary embolism among patients with pelvic and lower-extremity fractures in the National Trauma Data Bank. Univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression were used to assess potential risk factors for pulmonary embolism during the index hospitalization period. A total of 199,952 patients with pelvic and lower-extremity fracture were identified. Of these patients, 918 (0.46%) had a pulmonary embolism and 117 (12%) of them died during hospitalization. The risk of pulmonary embolism was significantly increased in patients with multiple fractures (odds ratio, 1.89; P<.001) only. No significant relationship was found with fracture location (pelvis, femur, tibia). Other factors that were associated with increased rates of pulmonary embolism were obesity (body mass index >40 odds ratio, 3.38; P<.001), history of warfarin use (P=.009), hospital disposition (surgery odds ratio, 1.68; P<.001; intensive care unit odds ratio, 2.4; P<.001), and hospital setting (university odds ratio, 1.36; P<.001). Multiple pelvic or lower-extremity fractures, but not their anatomic locations, were associated with pulmonary embolism in the National Trauma Data Bank. As expected, obese patients and those with a history of warfarin therapy have higher rates of pulmonary embolism. This study offers guidance in identifying patients with musculoskeletal trauma who are at elevated risk for pulmonary embolism.","Godzik, Jakub; McAndrew, Christopher M; Morshed, Saam; Kandemir, Utku; Kelly, Michael P",Orthopedics,https://doi.org/10.3928/01477447-20140528-50; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972431/,251
132701,"COVID-19: The significance of platelets, mitochondria, vitamin D, serotonin and the gut microbiota.",2021-05-25,"BACKGROUND Pandemic-related restrictions have limited traditional models of lactation support. RESEARCH AIMS The primary aim of this study was to determine changes to breastfeeding support services during the coronavirus-2019 pandemic according to trained lactation providers. The secondary aim was to assess strengths and limitations of telehealth services. METHODS A prospective survey was conducted entirely online using the Qualtrics platform during June 2020. Gatekeepers at Connecticut agencies and breastfeeding networks were forwarded an anonymous survey link to distribute to eligible lactation staff. RESULTS A variety of participants (N = 39) completed the survey and the majority (69.2%; n = 27) were providing only telehealth services. More than half (58.1%; n = 18) of the participants who conducting telehealth in any form, found that virtual lactation support was moderately effective compared to in-person support. Weakness of virtual support included technical and logistical difficulties, challenges assisting with latching or reading body language over the phone or online, and accurately assessing infant growth. Strengths related to virtual support included the flexibility and convenience of home-based support, expanded communication strategies, and safety from virus exposure. Further, visits with a lactation professional decreased significantly during the pandemic. Limited in-hospital and pediatrician support were also noted, particularly among groups without access to telehealth resources. CONCLUSIONS As a result of the pandemic and associated shifts in lactation services, breastfeeding disparities may be further exacerbated among those without equitable access to lactation support. Challenges and innovations in virtual support may influence adaptive options in the field moving forward.","Schindler-Ruwisch, Jennifer; Phillips, Kathryn E",Journal of human lactation : official journal of International Lactation Consultant Association,https://doi.org/10.1177/08903344211003898; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730895/,251

AIMS To evaluate rates of successful de-escalation at 12 months and to determine factors that may predict success. METHODS Single-centre experience of IBD patients that were de-escalated following deep remission on dose-intensified infliximab (IFX) or adalimumab (ADA) for secondary loss of response. Patients were classified as 'successes' if remaining on reduced anti-TNF or 'failures' if requiring re-escalation, steroids, surgery or enrolment into a clinical trial at 12 months. Patient demographics, disease characteristics, biomarkers (faecal calprotectin, C-reactive protein, albumin) and anti-TNF drug levels were collected 6-monthly. RESULTS Of 25 patients (20 CD, 5 UC), 16 (64%) were successes 12 months post-de-escalation. Median time to failure was 6 months. Six of the nine failures required anti-TNF re-escalation and three entered a clinical trial. Re-escalation recaptured response in all six patients. There was no significant difference in baseline biomarker activity between the two groups. There was no difference in infliximab levels between successes and failures at the time of de-escalation (5.5 vs. 5.3, p = 0.63) as well as 6 months (3.1 vs. 4.6, p = 0.95) and 12 months (3.2 vs. 4.5, p = 0.58) post-de-escalation. CONCLUSION Nearly two-thirds of patients remained on reduced anti-TNF dosing 12 months after de-escalation. All patients who failed de-escalation were recaptured after dose re-escalation.

We sought to examine LVHR without TFS in obese patients with small abdominal wall hernias. METHODS Between September 2002 and December 2007, 174 patients underwent LVHR at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Patients with BMI >30kg/m(2) and small primary abdominal wall hernias were eligible for repair without TFS. Correlation between BMI, defect surface area, operative time, and postoperative stay was assessed. RESULTS Fourteen patients underwent LVHR with no TFS, 2 with normal BMI and recurrent hernia after open repair and 12 with BMI >30 kg/m(2) and primary small hernia. Mean age was 38.8 years. The average defect size was 5.3cm(2); mean operative time (OT) was 42 minutes. Eleven patients (92%) were discharged home the day of surgery. No infectious or bleeding complications occurred. One patient required chronic pain management, and 8 patients (67%) developed seromas that resorbed spontaneously. There was no hernia recurrence at 7-month follow-up. CONCLUSION LVHR is feasible without TFS provided the hernia defect is small. Surgery can be performed on an outpatient basis in obese individuals with minimal postoperative morbidity.","Akkary, Ehab; Panait, Lucian; Roberts, Kurt; Duffy, Andrew; Bell, Robert",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680811x13022985131859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21902966/,251

MATERIALS AND METHODS We developed a new surgical technique for placement of paddle-type SCS electrode in presence of epidural scar tissue when conventional placement methods had failed. The technique involves creating a laminotomy trough to provide an adequate window for dissection of scar tissue to ensure safe placement of the electrode. We have applied this technique in eight patients. RESULTS Safe placement of SCS electrode was achieved in all eight patients without any complications. All electrodes were placed between T8 and T10 levels, and we were able to place the electrodes in the midline and achieve adequate coverage in all cases. CONCLUSION SCS is a widely accepted treatment modality for chronic neuropathic pain. Placement of paddle electrode can be challenging, usually because of the presence of epidural scar tissue. There have been reported cases of spinal cord injury related to paddle electrode placement. We present a novel technique that allows for safe placement of a paddle-type SCS electrode in more challenging surgical circumstances, including the presence of epidural scar tissue.","Pabaney, Aqueel H; Robin, Adam M; Schwalb, Jason M",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/ner.12174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725098/,251

Objective This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of an intervention of HIV/AIDS on the knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention and control among first year university students. Methods An awareness questionnaire was adopted to assess awareness and knowledge of HIV/AIDS pre- and post-health education among first year university students in Qinghai, China. Independent sample t-test, chi-square test, and multiple logistic regression analyses were used. Results A total of 2,165 and 2,062 first year university students were respectively recruited pre- and post- HIV/AIDS health education.

Drug intoxication deaths are generally classified as 'accidents' or unintentional, a fundamental mischaracterisation; most arose from repetitive self-harm behaviours related to substance acquisition and misuse. Moreover, given the burden of affirmative evidence required to determine suicide, many of these 'accidents' likely reflected unrecognised intentional acts-that is, suicides.

However, it is not clear whether the restricted perfusion affects the ovaries. In the present study, we examined the effect of a tourniquet on ovarian reserve and blood loss during myomectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS In a randomized double-blind clinical trial, fertile nonobese patients scheduled for abdominal myomectomy at Rasool-e-Akram Hospital from February 2018 to June 2019 were randomized to a tourniquet (n = 46) or a non-tourniquet group (n = 35). Serum levels of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured before and 3 months after surgery, blood loss was recorded during surgery, and serum levels of hemoglobin (Hb) were recorded before surgery, 6 h and 3 days after surgery. SPSS version 21 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Demographic, obstetric, and myoma characteristics were similar in the 2 groups (p > 0.05). The mean baseline values of AMH and FSH did not differ between groups (p > 0.05). After surgery, only FSH was higher in the control group (p = 0.043). Despite the time taken to fasten and open the tourniquet, the mean operating time was shorter in the tourniquet group (p < 0.001). Blood loss was higher in the control group (p = 0.005). The drop in Hb levels at 6 h after surgery was higher in the non-tourniquet group (p = 0.002). Blood loss was significantly associated with the duration of surgery (r = 0.523, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION The use of a tourniquet during abdominal myomectomy significantly reduced the mean volume of blood loss compared to the non-tourniquet group, while it did not prolong the duration of surgery, nor reduced the ovarian reserve. A tourniquet is a safe and efficient measure during abdominal myomectomy.","Mehdizadehkashi, Abolfazl; Tahermanesh, Kobra; Rokhgireh, Samaneh; Astaraei, Vahideh; Najmi, Zahra; Rakhshande, Mehrnoosh; Allahqoli, Leila; Ahmadi Pishkuhi, Mahin; Alkatout, Ibrahim; Chaichian, Shahla",Gynecologic and obstetric investigation,https://doi.org/10.1159/000510512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937634/,251

(2021) 'Vagal nerve stimulation for the treatment of male factor infertility'.,2021-04-30,"PURPOSE Peer review during physician chart rounds is a major quality assurance and patient safety step in radiation oncology. However, the effectiveness of chart rounds in detecting problematic treatment plans is unknown. We performed a prospective blinded study of error detection at chart rounds to clarify the effectiveness of this quality assurance step. METHODS AND MATERIALS Radiation Oncology Incident Learning System publications were queried for problematic plans approved for treatment that would be detectable at chart rounds. A resident physician, physicist, and dosimetrist collaboratively generated 20 treatment plans with simulated errors identical in nature to those reported to the Radiation Oncology Incident Learning System. These were inserted randomly into weekly chart rounds over 9 weeks, with a median of 2 problematic plans presented per chart rounds (range, 1-4). Data were collected on detection, attendance, length, and number of cases presented at chart rounds. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and univariable logistic regression with odds ratios. RESULTS The median length of chart rounds over the study period was 60 minutes (range, 42-79); median number of cases presented per chart rounds was 45 (range, 38-50). The overall detection rate was 55% (11 of 20). Detection rates were higher for cases presented earlier in chart rounds: 75% versus 25% of problematic plans were detected within 30 minutes of start of chart rounds versus after 30 minutes (odds ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.88; P = .037). Detection rates showed a trend toward increase during the study period but this was not significant: 33% in weeks 1 to 5 and 73% during weeks 6 to 9 (5.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-36; P = .08). CONCLUSIONS The detection of clinically significant problematic plans during chart rounds could be significantly improved. Problematic plans are more frequently detected earlier in chart rounds and inserting such plans into chart rounds may enhance detection; however, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. A multi-institutional study is planned.","Talcott, Wesley J; Lincoln, Holly; Kelly, Jacqueline R; Tressel, Lauren; Wilson, Lynn D; Decker, Roy H; Ford, Eric; Hartvigson, Pehr E; Pawlicki, Todd; Evans, Suzanne B",Practical radiation oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prro.2020.05.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888524/,251

METHODS The I-eHealth solution was offered to IBD patients aged 10-17 years old in non-biological treatment. The application was used monthly and in case of flare-ups. Blood and fecal calprotectin (FC) were tested every three months and during flare-ups. A total inflammation score (based on symptoms and FC) was visualized for the patient in a traffic light curve. An IBD-nurse followed up on the registrations every two weeks. Patients had one yearly planned visit at the hospital. On-demand visits were arranged depending on the total inflammation. I-eHealth results were compared with data from a previous RCT-eHealth study (the control group of which had four planned annual visits). RESULTS 36 IBD patients were followed by I-eHealth, mean age 14.7 (SD 7.75). The median (IQR) duration of using I-eHealth was 1.9 years (0.29-2.51), equal to 66.11 patient years, compared to 40.45 in the RCT-eHealth group and 46.49 in the RCT-control group. On-demand visits per patient year did not differ between the groups: 1.13 (I-eHealth), 1.16 (RCT-eHealth) and 0.84 (RCT-control) (p = 0.84/0.85). Hospitalizations and acute outpatient visits per patient year did not differ between the groups: 0.11 and 0.11 (I-eHealth), 0.05 and 0.02 (RCT-eHealth), 0.11 and 0.11 (RCT-control) (p = 0.17/0.81 and 0.12/0.81).

Of late, there appears to be an increasing movement toward this practice. There has not been a recent update on these diets from a health perspective. Using the National Centre for Biotechnology Information PubMed database, a search was made for all studies published between 2000 and 2016 that met defined inclusion criteria. A total of 25 studies were located with 12 focusing on body weight and diet quality. There was emerging evidence suggestive of benefits for body weight, improved markers of metabolic health, blood pressure, and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. SVD may also have a role to play in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease. Given that there is a higher tendency for females to be flexitarian yet males are more likely to overconsume meat, there is a clear need to communicate the potential health benefits of these diets to males.","Derbyshire, Emma J",Frontiers in nutrition,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2016.00055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28111625/,251
135573,Adapting the ordre public and morality exclusion of European patent law to accommodate emerging technologies.,2020-05-01,"Three-dimensional (3D) molecular similarity, one major ligand-based virtual screening (VS) method, has been widely used in the drug discovery process. A variety of 3D molecular similarity tools have been developed in recent decades. In this study, we assessed a panel of 15 3D molecular similarity programs against the DUD-E and LIT-PCBA datasets, including commercial ROCS and Phase, in terms of screening power and scaffold-hopping power. The results revealed that (1) SHAFTS, LS-align, Phase Shape_Pharm and LIGSIFT showed the best VS capability in terms of screening power. Some 3D similarity tools available to academia can yield relatively better VS performance than commercial ROCS and Phase software. (2) Current 3D similarity VS tools exhibit a considerable ability to capture actives with new chemotypes in terms of scaffold hopping. (3) Multiple conformers relative to single conformations will generally improve VS performance for most 3D similarity tools, with marginal improvement observed in area under the receiving operator characteristic curve values, enrichment factor in the top 1% and hit rate in the top 1% values showed larger improvement. Moreover, redundancy and complementarity analyses of hit lists from different query seeds and different 3D similarity VS tools showed that the combination of different query seeds and/or different 3D similarity tools in VS campaigns retrieved more (and more diverse) active molecules. These findings provide useful information for guiding choices of the optimal 3D molecular similarity tools for VS practices and designing possible combination strategies to discover more diverse active compounds.","Jiang, Zhenla; Xu, Jianrong; Yan, Aixia; Wang, Ling",Briefings in bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151363/,251

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and grey literature up to 2 February 2018. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Randomised controlled trials in non-pregnant outpatients with type 1 diabetes that compared the use of any artificial pancreas system with any type of insulin based treatment. Primary outcome was proportion (%) of time that sensor glucose level was within the near normoglycaemic range (3.9-10 mmol/L). Secondary outcomes included proportion (%) of time that sensor glucose level was above 10 mmol/L or below 3.9 mmol/L, low blood glucose index overnight, mean sensor glucose level, total daily insulin needs, and glycated haemoglobin. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was used to assess study quality. RESULTS 40 studies (1027 participants with data for 44 comparisons) were included in the meta-analysis. 35 comparisons assessed a single hormone artificial pancreas system, whereas nine comparisons assessed a dual hormone system. Only nine studies were at low risk of bias. Proportion of time in the near normoglycaemic range (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) was significantly higher with artificial pancreas use, both overnight (weighted mean difference 15.15%, 95% confidence interval 12.21% to 18.09%) and over a 24 hour period (9.62%, 7.54% to 11.7%). Artificial pancreas systems had a favourable effect on the proportion of time with sensor glucose level above 10 mmol/L (-8.52%, -11.14% to -5.9%) or below 3.9 mmol/L (-1.49%, -1.86% to -1.11%) over 24 hours, compared with control treatment. Robustness of findings for the primary outcome was verified in sensitivity analyses, by including only trials at low risk of bias (11.64%, 9.1% to 14.18%) or trials under unsupervised, normal living conditions (10.42%, 8.63% to 12.2%). Results were consistent in a subgroup analysis both for single hormone and dual hormone artificial pancreas systems. CONCLUSIONS Artificial pancreas systems are an efficacious and safe approach for treating outpatients with type 1 diabetes. The main limitations of current research evidence on artificial pancreas systems are related to inconsistency in outcome reporting, small sample size, and short follow-up duration of individual trials.","Bekiari, Eleni; Kitsios, Konstantinos; Thabit, Hood; Tauschmann, Martin; Athanasiadou, Eleni; Karagiannis, Thomas; Haidich, Anna-Bettina; Hovorka, Roman; Tsapas, Apostolos",BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k1310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29669716/,251

Liposomal (LE) antibiotics allow low-frequency dosing and extended efficacy compared with standard (STD) formulations. We developed a novel sulfuric acid-loading method for doxycycline liposomes (LE-doxy). We hypothesized that a single s.c. injection of LE-doxy would be detectable in serum for at least 2 weeks at concentrations equal to or better than STD-doxy and would be bactericidal in an in vitro Mycobacterium smegmatis infection of J774A.1 macrophage cells. Liposomes were encapsulated by sulfuric acid gradient loading, and release kinetics were performed in vitro and in vivo. LE-doxy made using 8.25 mg/ml doxycycline loaded for 24 hours achieved 97.77% capture in 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 43.87% in sphingomyelin (sphing). Rats were injected s.c. with 50 mg/kg LE-doxy or 5 mg/kg STD-doxy, and serial blood samples were collected. Pharmacokinetics were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. Liver and injection site skin samples were collected at euthanasia (4 weeks postinjection). Minimal histologic tissue reactions occurred after injection of STD (nonliposomal), DPPC, or sphing-doxy. DPPC-doxy had slightly faster in vitro leakage than sphing liposomes, although both were detectable at 264 hours. The mean residence time for DPPC was the highest (111.78 hours), followed by sphing (56.00 hours) and STD (6.86 hours). DPPC and sphing-doxy were detectable at 0.2 μg/ml in serum at 336 hours postadministration. LE-doxy was not toxic to J774A.1 cells in vitro and produced inhibition of viable Mycobacterium smegmatis at 24 and 48 hours. LE-doxy will require further testing in in vivo infection models.","Franklin, Rebekah K; Marcus, Sarah A; Talaat, Adel M; KuKanich, Butch K; Sullivan, Ruth; Krugner-Higby, Lisa A; Heath, Timothy D",Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,https://doi.org/10.1124/dmd.115.063602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26033620/,251
136333,Articles of Public Interest.,2020-10-01,"OBJECTIVES Preliminary investigations suggest that a novel blue light (BL) laser with a wavelength of 445 nm is comparable to the commonly utilized potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser (532 nm) for treatment of various laryngeal pathologies. The objective of the current study is to make a direct histological comparison of the degree of vocal fold scarring after either BL or KTP laser treatment in an animal model. STUDY DESIGN This was a randomized controlled study using rats. METHODS Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to BL or KTP laser treatment. Laser was delivered in non-overlapping pulses to normal rat vocal folds. Larynges in each group were harvested at three time points: post-operative day 1, 30, and 90. Three animals served as negative controls. The excised whole larynges were sectioned transversely and stained with hematoxylin/eosin and trichrome. Presence of subepithelial inflammation and protein deposition/fibrosis indicative of scarring were scored semi-quantitatively (from grade 1-3) by two pathologists blinded to treatment groups. RESULTS Between-group comparison showed that both laser treatments resulted in significantly elevated subepithelial protein deposition/fibrosis 90 days after treatment compared to negative controls (BL: 2 ± 0; KTP: 2.67 ± 0.29; control: 1.17 ± 0.29; P < .05). However, the degree of protein deposition/fibrosis was significantly higher in the KTP group compared to the BL group (P = .016). Within-group comparison showed that the KTP group showed evidence of fibrosis as early as 30 days after treatment, which was not observed in the BL group. CONCLUSIONS The current study suggests that the degree of scarring is significantly less after BL laser treatment compared to KTP in normal rat vocal fold tissue.

136456,"The effects of environmental stressors on the mortality of the oldest old male population in Hong Kong, 1977-2006.",2008,"BACKGROUND Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is a common serious problem after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Flange gastrojejunostomy (FL-GE) is a previously described technique that creates an internal flange in a hand-sewn gastroenterostomy. Results of FL-GE on incidence and severity of DGE after PD are presented. STUDY DESIGN Data were extracted from a prospective database of PD. Standard PD with antrectomy were performed with flange gastroenterostomy (FL-GE) or other techniques (NonFL-GE) at a single institution. The International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) definition of DGE was used, and DGE severity was graded based on the ISGPS grading system and the Modified Accordion Grading System (MAGS). RESULTS There were 215 standard PDs performed. Sixty-eight (32%) were FL-GE and 147 (68%) were NonFL-GE. Delayed gastric emptying rates in FL-GE and NonFL-GE were 9% and 23%, respectively (p = 0.012). Differences in severity of DGE were even more prominent: 29% of DGEs in the NonFL-GE group were ISGPS grade C vs 0% in FL-GE. Also, 35% of DGEs in the NonFL-GE group were MAGS 3 vs 0% in FL-GE. Because of some differences in sex and inflammatory complications between groups, a propensity score analysis was performed, creating 57 matched patients in the FL-GE and NonFL-GE groups. The incidence of DGE remained significantly different in the groups (5% in FL-GE vs 18% in NonFL-GE; p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS In this cohort study, the flange technique was associated with a marked reduction in the incidence of DGE after PD.","Khan, Adeel S; Williams, Greg; Woolsey, Cheryl; Liu, Jingxia; Fields, Ryan C; Doyle, Majella M B; Hawkins, William G; Strasberg, Steven M",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2017.06.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28687510/,251

PURPOSE Pharmacy departments across the country are problem-solving the growing issue of drug shortages. We aim to change the drug shortage management strategy from a reactive process to a more proactive approach using predictive data analytics. By doing so, we can drive our decision-making to more efficiently manage drug shortages. METHODS Internal purchasing, formulary, and drug shortage data were reviewed to identify drugs subject to a high shortage risk (""shortage drugs"") or not subject to a high shortage risk (""nonshortage drugs""). Potential candidate predictors of drug shortage risk were collected from previous literature. The dataset was trained and tested using 2 methods, including k-fold cross-validation and a 70/30 partition into a training dataset and a testing dataset, respectively. RESULTS A total of 1,517 shortage and nonshortage drugs were included. The following candidate predictors were used to build the dataset: dosage form, therapeutic class, controlled substance schedule (Schedule II or Schedules III-V), orphan drug status, generic versus branded status, and number of manufacturers. Predictors that positively predicted shortages included classification of drugs as intravenous-only, both oral and intravenous, antimicrobials, analgesics, electrolytes, anesthetics, and cardiovascular agents. Predictors that negatively predicted a shortage included classification as an oral-only agent, branded-only agent, antipsychotic, Schedule II agent, or orphan drug, as well as the total number of manufacturers. The calculated sensitivity was 0.71; the specificity, 0.93; the accuracy, 0.87; and the C statistic, 0.93. CONCLUSION The study demonstrated the use of predictive analytics to create a drug shortage model using drug characteristics and manufacturing variables.","Liu, Ina; Colmenares, Evan; Tak, Casey; Vest, Mary-Haston; Clark, Henry; Oertel, Maryann; Pappas, Ashley",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821926/,251

In the present study, the clinical and radiologic outcomes of unruptured intracranial vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms with brain stem compression based on different treatment modalities were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study included 28 patients with unruptured intracranial vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms with brain stem compression treated from January 2009 to December 2017. Treatment methods were observation (n = 6), stent-assisted coil embolization (n = 9), parent artery occlusion (n = 6), and flow diversion (n = 7). The data of baseline characteristics, change of aneurysm size, retreatment rate, stroke occurrence, and alteration of the mRS score were obtained from retrospective chart review. RESULTS The initial size of dissecting aneurysms was largest in the flow diversion group (22.5 ± 7.7 mm), followed by parent artery occlusion (20.3 ± 8.4 mm), stent-assisted coil embolization (11.7 ± 2.2 mm), and observation (17.8 ± 5.5 mm; P = .01) groups. The reduction rate of aneurysm size was highest in the parent artery occlusion group (26.7 ± 32.1%), followed by flow diversion (14.1% ± 28.7%), stent-assisted coil embolization (-17.9 ± 30.3%), and observation (-31.5 ± 30.8%; P = .007) groups. Additional treatment was needed in the observation (4/6, 66.7%) and stent-assisted coil embolization (3/9, 33.3%; P = .017) groups. Improvement of the mRS score on follow-up was observed in the flow diversion (6/7, 85.7%) and parent artery occlusion (4/6, 66.7%) groups but not in the stent-assisted coil embolization and observation groups. A worsened mRS score was most common in the observation group (4/6, 66.7%), followed by stent-assisted coil embolization (3/9, 33.3%), parent artery occlusion (2/6, 33.3%), and flow diversion (0/7, 0%) groups. CONCLUSIONS When treating intracranial vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms with brain stem compression, parent artery occlusion and flow diversion should be considered to reduce aneurysm size and improve the mRS score.","Cho, D Y; Kim, B-S; Choi, J H; Park, Y K; Shin, Y S",AJNR.

139931,Genital tb-diagnostic algorithm and treatment.,2020-12-01,"INTRODUCTION Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) (sacral nerve stimulation SNS) has become an established therapy for functional disorders of the pelvic organs. Despite its overall success, the therapy fails in a proportion of patients. This may be partially due to inadequate electrode placement with suboptimal coupling of the electrode and nerve. Based on these assumptions the technique of sacral spinal neuromodulation has been redefined. All descriptions relate to the only currently available system licensed for all pelvic indications (Medtronic Interstim® ). METHOD An international multidisciplinary working party of ten individuals highly experienced in performing SNM convened two meetings (including live operating) to standardize the implant procedure. This report addresses the main steps to optimal electrode lead placement in temporal sequence. RESULTS Key elements of the electrode placement are radiological marking, the use of a curved stylet, the entry of the electrode into the sacral foramen and its progression through the foramen, its placement guided by a combination of a typical appearance in fluoroscopy and achieving specific motor/sensory responses with stimulation. The report describes quadripolar electrode placement and then either insertion of a connecting percutaneous extension lead or permanent implantation of the programmable device. CONCLUSION Standardization of electrode placement may ensure close electrode proximity to the target nerve providing a higher likelihood for optimal effect with less energy consumption (better battery longevity), more programming options with more electrode contacts close to the nerve and reduced likelihood of side-effects. The potentially better clinical outcome needs to be demonstrated.","Matzel, Klaus E; Chartier-Kastler, Emmanuel; Knowles, Charles H; Lehur, Paul A; Muñoz-Duyos, Arantxa; Ratto, Carlo; Rydningen, Mona B; Sørensen, Michael; van Kerrebroeck, Philip; de Wachter, Stefan",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/ner.12695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28975677/,251

140443,Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND Respiratory depression, a potentially fatal side-effect of opioid-overdose, may be reversed by timely administration of an opioid antagonist, such as naloxone or naltrexone. Tampering with a formulation of morphine sulfate and sequestered naltrexone hydrochloride extended release capsules (MS-sNT) releases both the opioid morphine and the antagonist naltrexone. A study in recreational opioid-users indicated that morphine and naltrexone injected in the 25:1 ratio (duplicating the ratio of the formulation) found MS-sNT reduced morphine-induced euphoric effects vs intravenous (IV) morphine alone. In the same study, the effects of morphine + naltrexone on end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2), a measure of respiratory-depression, were evaluated and these data are reported here. METHODS Single-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. Non-dependent male opioid users were randomized to receive single IV doses of placebo, 30 mg morphine alone, and 30 mg morphine + 1.2 mg naltrexone. EtCO2 was measured by noninvasive capnography. RESULTS Significant differences in EtCO2 least-squares means across all treatments for maximal effect (Emax) and area under the effect curve (AUE0-2, AUE0-8, AUE0-24) were detected (all p ≤ 0.0011). EtCO2 Emax values for morphine + naltrexone were significantly reduced vs morphine alone (42.9 mm Hg vs 47.1 mm Hg, p < 0.0001) and were not significantly different vs placebo (41.9 mm Hg). Median time to reach maximal effect (TEmax) was delayed for morphine + naltrexone vs morphine alone (5.0 h vs 1.0 h). CONCLUSIONS Results provide preliminary evidence that the naltrexone:morphine ratio within MS-sNT is sufficient to significantly reduce EtCO2 when administered intravenously to non-dependent male recreational opioid-users. Further studies with multiple measures of respiratory-function are warranted to determine if risk of respiratory depression is also reduced by naltrexone in the tampered formulation.","Goli, Veeraindar; Webster, Lynn R; Lamson, Michael J; Cleveland, Jody M; Sommerville, Kenneth W; Carter, Eric",Harm reduction journal,https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-7517-9-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22420453/,251
140702,Real-life clinical experience of using diphencyclopropenone.,2021-05-14,"BACKGROUND Aerobic training and breathing exercises are interventions that improve asthma control. However, the outcomes of these 2 interventions have not been compared. OBJECTIVE To compare the effects of aerobic training versus breathing exercises on clinical control (primary outcome), quality of life, exercise capacity, and airway inflammation in outpatients with moderate-to-severe asthma. METHODS Fifty-four asthmatics were randomized into either the aerobic training group (AG, n = 29) or the breathing exercise group (BG, n = 25). Both interventions lasted for 24 sessions (2/week, 40 minutes/session). Asthma clinical control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ]), quality of life (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire), asthma symptom-free days (ASFD), airway inflammation, exercise capacity, psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), daily-life physical activity (DLPA), and pulmonary function were evaluated before, immediately after, and 3 months after the intervention. RESULTS Both interventions presented similar results regarding the ACQ score, psychological distress, ASFD, DLPA, and airway inflammation (P > .05). However, participants in the AG were 2.6 times more likely to experience clinical improvement at the 3-month follow-up than participants in the BG (P = .02). A greater proportion of participants in the AG also presented a reduction in the number of days without rescue medication use compared with BG (34% vs 8%; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS Outpatients with moderate-to-severe asthma who participated in aerobic training or breathing exercise programs presented similar results in asthma control, quality of life, asthma symptoms, psychological distress, physical activity, and airway inflammation. However, a greater proportion of participants in the AG presented improvement in asthma control and reduced use of rescue medication.","Evaristo, Karen B; Mendes, Felipe Augusto Rodrigues; Saccomani, Milene G; Cukier, Alberto; Carvalho-Pinto, Regina M; Rodrigues, Marcos R; Santaella, Danilo F; Saraiva-Romanholo, Beatriz M; Martins, Milton A; Carvalho, Celso R F",The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

Symptoms of continuous pain can produce psychological disorders, such as anxiety and depression. The spread of COVID-19 pandemic added to distress experienced by patients with IC emotions, such as fear, sadness, boredom, frustration and anger. MATERIALS AND METHODS A research on very recent literature outlines the necessity for patients facing the complexity of IC during the COVID-19 outbreak to prevent the temporary crisis, to broaden perspectives, to deal with confusion, to support in struggling with unpleasant and unexpected events. CONCLUSIONS People affected by IC have a psychological vulnerability that needs tailored support interventions, particularly in the COVID era. A multidisciplinary approach offers a personalized treatment through a web-mediated counseling intervention for patients and their caregivers: a space for continuous discussion and reflection can favour a relationship-based process of change aimed at an improvement in quality of life.","Marano, G; Gaetani, E; Marturano, M; Sani, G; Gasbarrini, A; Scambia, G; Mazza, M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202102_25116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33660824/,251

141701,"The European Academy of Neurology is six years old: Challenges, opportunities and strategic priorities for the future.",2020-05-14,"Tandem mass tag (TMT) is a multiplexing technology widely-used in proteomic research. It enables relative quantification of proteins from multiple biological samples in a single mass spectrometry run with high efficiency and high throughput. However, experiments often require more biological replicates or conditions than can be accommodated by a single run, and involve multiple TMT mixtures and multiple runs. Such larger-scale experiments combine sources of biological and technical variation in patterns that are complex, unique to TMT-based workflows, and challenging for the downstream statistical analysis. These patterns cannot be adequately characterized by statistical methods designed for other technologies, such as label-free proteomics or transcriptomics. This manuscript proposes a general statistical approach for relative protein quantification in mass spectrometry-based experiments with TMT labeling. It is applicable to experiments with multiple conditions, multiple biological replicate runs and multiple technical replicate runs, and unbalanced designs. It is based on a flexible family of linear mixed-effects models that handle complex patterns of technical artifacts and missing values. The approach is implemented in MSstatsTMT, a freely available open-source R/Bioconductor package compatible with data processing tools such as Proteome Discoverer, MaxQuant, OpenMS and SpectroMine. Evaluation on a controlled mixture, simulated datasets, and three biological investigations with diverse designs demonstrated that MSstatsTMT balanced the sensitivity and the specificity of detecting differentially abundant proteins, in particular in large-scale experiments with multiple biological mixtures.","Huang, Ting; Choi, Meena; Tzouros, Manuel; Golling, Sabrina; Pandya, Nikhil Janak; Banfai, Balazs; Dunkley, Tom; Vitek, Olga",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.ra120.002105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680918/,251
142042,Epilepsy in children with leukodystrophies.,2020-05-09,"UNLABELLED Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an emerging pathogen that causes severe respiratory illness. Whole UV-inactivated SARS-CoV (UV-V), bearing multiple epitopes and proteins, is a candidate vaccine against this virus. However, whole inactivated SARS vaccine that includes nucleocapsid protein is reported to induce eosinophilic infiltration in mouse lungs after challenge with live SARS-CoV. In this study, an ability of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists to reduce the side effects of UV-V vaccination in a 6-month-old adult BALB/c mouse model was investigated, using the mouse-passaged Frankfurt 1 isolate of SARS-CoV. Immunization of adult mice with UV-V, with or without alum, resulted in partial protection from lethal doses of SARS-CoV challenge, but extensive eosinophil infiltration in the lungs was observed. In contrast, TLR agonists added to UV-V vaccine, including lipopolysaccharide, poly(U), and poly(I·C) (UV-V+TLR), strikingly reduced excess eosinophilic infiltration in the lungs and induced lower levels of interleukin-4 and -13 and eotaxin in the lungs than UV-V-immunization alone. Additionally, microarray analysis showed that genes associated with chemotaxis, eosinophil migration, eosinophilia, and cell movement and the polarization of Th2 cells were upregulated in UV-V-immunized but not in UV-V+TLR-immunized mice. In particular, CD11b(+) cells in the lungs of UV-V-immunized mice showed the upregulation of genes associated with the induction of eosinophils after challenge. These findings suggest that vaccine-induced eosinophil immunopathology in the lungs upon SARS-CoV infection could be avoided by the TLR agonist adjuvants. IMPORTANCE Inactivated whole severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) vaccines induce neutralizing antibodies in mouse models; however, they also cause increased eosinophilic immunopathology in the lungs upon SARS-CoV challenge. In this study, the ability of adjuvant Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists to reduce the side effects of UV-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccination in a BALB/c mouse model was tested, using the mouse-passaged Frankfurt 1 isolate of SARS-CoV. We found that TLR stimulation reduced the high level of eosinophilic infiltration that occurred in the lungs of mice immunized with UV-inactivated SARS-CoV. Microarray analysis revealed that genes associated with chemotaxis, eosinophil migration, eosinophilia, and cell movement and the polarization of Th2 cells were upregulated in UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-immunized mice. This study may be helpful for elucidating the pathogenesis underlying eosinophilic infiltration resulting from immunization with inactivated vaccine.","Iwata-Yoshikawa, Naoko; Uda, Akihiko; Suzuki, Tadaki; Tsunetsugu-Yokota, Yasuko; Sato, Yuko; Morikawa, Shigeru; Tashiro, Masato; Sata, Tetsutaro; Hasegawa, Hideki; Nagata, Noriyo",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00983-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24850731/,251

The aim of the current review was to investigate the incidence and profile of cognitive impairments in patients with classical galactosemia. METHOD MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsychINFO were searched up to 23 October 2018 for studies examining information processing speed, attention, memory, language, visuospatial functioning, executive functioning and social cognition in patients with confirmed classical galactosemia utilizing standardized neuropsychological tests. Data synthesis followed a narrative approach, since the planned meta-analysis was not possible due to large variability between the neuropsychological assessments. RESULTS Eleven studies were included, including case-studies. The quality of most studies was moderate to low. As a group, patients with classical galactosemia exhibit below average to low scores on all cognitive domains. A large proportion of the patients perform on an impaired level on attention, memory and vocabulary. Evidence for impairments in information processing speed, language, visuospatial functioning and aspects of executive functioning was limited due to the small number of studies investigating these cognitive functions. Social cognition was not examined at all. CONCLUSIONS Given the moderate to low quality of the included studies and the limited evidence in many cognitive domains, the incidence of cognitive impairment in patients with classical galactosemia is not yet clear. Both clinicians and researchers encountering patients with classical galactosemia need to be aware of possible cognitive impairments. Future well-designed studies are needed to determine the cognitive profile of classical galactosemia. This can be the basis for the development of intervention strategies.","Hermans, Merel E; Welsink-Karssies, Mendy M; Bosch, Annet M; Oostrom, Kim J; Geurtsen, Gert J",Orphanet journal of rare diseases,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-019-1215-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627760/,251

Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-square regression (PLS) were used to evaluate and quantify the lubricant effectiveness on a model tablet formulation. PCA score and loading plots showed a separation of model formulations based on the MgSt sources, which indicated different bovine- and vegetable-derived MgSt lubrication potential. PLS quantified the MgSt molecular [enthalpy of dehydration (ΔHd), enthalpy of melting (ΔHm), percent crystallinity, and moisture content] and macroscopic [particle size (d50 ), specific surface area (SSA-MgSt), and MgSt Hausner ratio (HF-MgSt)] properties, their interactions, and square effects on formulation powder flow and tableting properties relating to MgSt's lubrication effectiveness. For crystalline MgSt, moisture content, HF-MgSt, d50 , and SSA-MgSt showed a major influence on the lubrication efficiency compared with the other MgSt molecular properties (percent crystallinity, ΔHm, and ΔHd). Amorphous MgSt showed poor lubrication, and none of its molecular or macroscopic properties showed significant effects on lubrication efficiency.","Haware, Rahul V; Shivagari, Ramya; Johnson, Paul R; Staton, Scott; Stagner, William C; Gupta, Mali Ram",Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,https://doi.org/10.1002/jps.23920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24596131/,251
143057,Application of Pathogen Discovery/Metagenomic Sequencing in CNS HIV.,2020-08-25,"OBJECTIVE The COVID-19 pandemic requires thinking about alternatives to establish ECMO when often-limited hardware resources are exhausted. Heart-lung-machines may potentially be used for ECMO but contain roller pumps as compared to centrifugal pumps in ECMO-circuits. We here tested roller pumps as rescue pump for ECMO-establishment. METHODS We set up in vitro circuits on roller pumps from C5 heart-lung-machine with 5 l/minutes flow. In two series, we placed either PVC or silicon tubing for an ECMO circuit into the roller pump. We assessed the mechanical stress on the tubing (aiming to run the pump for at least 1 week), measured the temperature increase generated by the friction and assessed flow characteristics and its measurement in simulated situations resembling tube kinking and suction. RESULTS The roller pumps led to expected and unexpected adverse events. PVC tubing burst between 36 and 78 hours, while silicon tubing lasted for at least 7 days. At 7 days, the silicone tubing showed significant signs of roller pump wear visible on the outside. The inside, however, was free of surface irregularities. Using these tubings in a roller pump led to a remarkable increase in circuit temperature (PVC: +12.0°C, silicone +2.9°C). Kinking or suction on the device caused the expected dramatic flow reduction (as assessed by direct measurement) while the roller pump display continued to show the preset flow. The roller pump is therefore not able to reliably determine the true flow rate. CONCLUSION Roller pumps with silicone tubing but not PVC tubing may be used for running ECMO circuits. Silicone tubing may endure the roller pump shear forces for up to 1 week. Thus, repeated tubing repositioning may be a solution. Circuit heating and substantial limitations in flow detection should increase attention if clinical use in situations of crisis is considered.","Kaluza, Mirko; May, Benjamin; Doenst, Torsten",Perfusion,https://doi.org/10.1177/0267659121996182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33637027/,251

The TREVO-2 trial was a randomized controlled trial comparing a novel endovascular stroke treatment device (the Trevo device) to a previous-generation endovascular stroke treatment device (the Merci device). METHODS We used data from the TREVO-2 trial to validate the Totaled Health Risks in Vascular Events (THRIVE) score in patients receiving treatment with a third-generation endovascular stroke treatment device and to compare THRIVE to other predictive scores. We used logistic regression to model outcomes and compared score performance with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS In the TREVO-2 trial, the THRIVE score strongly predicts clinical outcome and mortality. The relationship between THRIVE score and outcome is not influenced by either success of recanalization or the type of device used (Trevo versus Merci). The superiority of the Trevo device to the Merci device is evident particularly among patients with a low-to-moderate THRIVE score (0-5; 53.8% good outcome with Trevo versus 27.5% good outcome with Merci). In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the THRIVE score was comparable or superior to several other outcome prediction scores (HIAT, HIAT-2, SPAN-100, and iScore). CONCLUSIONS The THRIVE score strongly predicts clinical outcome and mortality in the TREVO-2 trial. Taken together with THRIVE validation data from patients receiving intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator or no acute treatment, the THRIVE score has broad predictive power in patients with acute ischemic stroke, which is likely because THRIVE reflects a set of strong nonmodifiable predictors of stroke outcome.

143502,Emerging therapies for common eye conditions.,2020-11-01,"UNLABELLED Quick information on airborne infectious disease transmission in airliner cabins is essential to reduce the risk of infection of passengers and crew members. This investigation proposed a one-dimensional analytical model that can predict the longitudinal transmission of airborne contaminants or disease viruses inside an airliner cabin. The model considered both diffusive and convective transport of contaminants in the longitudinal direction of the cabin but assumed complete mixing of contaminants in the cabin cross-section. The effect of recirculation of the cabin air and efficiency of the high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters is also considered in the model. The analytical solution for the one-dimensional contaminant transport model is obtained by using the principle of superposition and the method of separation of variables. The analytical solutions agree well with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results. The coupling of a CFD model with the one-dimensional analytical model could capture the impact of local airflow on contaminant transport. This analytical model has been used for analyzing contaminant transport in a 30-row all-economy-class airliner cabin with minimal computing effort. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS The paper presents a new one-dimensional analytical model that can provide quick information on global airborne contaminant transmissions in airliner cabins for effective response plans. The model can be used to study the effects of air exchange rates, recirculation, efficiency of the high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and longitudinal airflow on airborne contaminant transport in airliner cabins with minimal computing effort.","Mazumdar, S; Chen, Q",Indoor air,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0668.2008.00553.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19191923/,251

The parasite ""Taenia solium"" causes this disease and has a complex life cycle and molts into various stages that influence the host-parasite interaction. The disease has a long asymptomatic phase with viable cyst and degeneration of cyst and leaking cyst fluid has been associated with symptomatic phase. The parasite proteome holds the answers and clues to this complex clinical presentation and hence unravelling of proteome of parasite antigens is needed for better understanding of host-parasite interactions. OBJECTIVE To understand the proteome make-up of T. solium cyst vesicular fluid (VF) and excretory secretory proteins (ESPs). METHODOLOGY The VF and ESPs for the study were prepared from cyst harvested from naturally infected swine. The samples were prepared for nano LC-MS by in-tube digestion of proteins. The spectra obtained were annotated and enrichment analysis was performed and in silico analysis was done. RESULTS T. solium VF and ESPs have 206 and 247 proteins of varied make-up including pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory nature.

The analysis of intracellular hydrogen peroxides and malondialdehyde suggested that the growth of C. utilis was inhibited under different concentrations of U(VI) due to the abundant production of reactive oxide species. The activity of intracellular antioxidants (e.g., super oxide dismutase and glutathione) was significantly enhanced under U(VI) stress, indicating the anti-toxic effect of C. utilis cells under low U(VI) stress.

This study determines correlations between program reputation and social media activity and popularity, specifically among otolaryngology residency programs. METHODS Accredited programs, excluding military and osteopathic, in the United States were included. Activity and popularity on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram were assessed during the same 7-month period from 2016 to 2020. Doximity Residency reputation scores (dividing programs into quartiles) and US News & World Report (comparing programs affiliated with top hospitals versus those with unranked hospitals) were utilized to compare differences based on reputation. RESULTS Of 104 programs, 91 (88%) had social media accounts. Instagram and Twitter were more commonly used than Facebook, with 78 (75%), 49 (47%), and 42 (40%) accounts, respectively. The cumulative use of all three platforms grew yearly, while Twitter (R2 = 0.9863) and Instagram (R2 = 0.9955) presence increased exponentially. Doximity's top quartile programs had more Facebook (P = .020), Twitter (P < .001), and Instagram (P = .102) accounts. First-quartile programs also adopted each platform months before fourth-quartile programs. Stratified by US News & World Report, ranked programs had more social media accounts, with 24 (53%) on Facebook (P = .028), 32 (71%) on Twitter (P < .001), and 37 (82%) on Instagram (P = .155). Programs with higher reputations were more active and exhibited increased likes and followers over time. CONCLUSION Social media use among otolaryngology programs has grown exponentially, with Instagram and Twitter becoming the dominant platforms.

144614,Error in Results.,2018,"BACKGROUND Appropriate planning is crucial to avoid morbidity and mortality when difficulty is anticipated with airway management. Many guidelines developed by national societies have focused on management of difficulty encountered in the unconscious patient; however, little guidance appears in the literature on how best to approach the patient with an anticipated difficult airway. METHODS To review this and other subjects, the Canadian Airway Focus Group (CAFG) was re-formed. With representation from anesthesiology, emergency medicine, and critical care, CAFG members were assigned topics for review. As literature reviews were completed, results were presented and discussed during teleconferences and two face-to-face meetings. When appropriate, evidence- or consensus-based recommendations were made, and levels of evidence were assigned. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Previously published predictors of difficult direct laryngoscopy are widely known. More recent studies report predictors of difficult face mask ventilation, video laryngoscopy, use of a supraglottic device, and cricothyrotomy. All are important facets of a complete airway evaluation and must be considered when difficulty is anticipated with airway management. Many studies now document the increasing patient morbidity that occurs with multiple attempts at tracheal intubation. Therefore, when difficulty is anticipated, tracheal intubation after induction of general anesthesia should be considered only when success with the chosen device(s) can be predicted in a maximum of three attempts. Concomitant predicted difficulty using oxygenation by face mask or supraglottic device ventilation as a fallback makes an awake approach advisable. Contextual issues, such as patient cooperation, availability of additional skilled help, and the clinician's experience, must also be considered in deciding the appropriate strategy. CONCLUSIONS With an appropriate airway evaluation and consideration of relevant contextual issues, a rational decision can be made on whether an awake approach to tracheal intubation will maximize patient safety or if airway management can safely proceed after induction of general anesthesia. With predicted difficulty, close attention should be paid to details of implementing the chosen approach. This should include having a plan in case of the failure of tracheal intubation or patient oxygenation.","Law, J Adam; Broemling, Natasha; Cooper, Richard M; Drolet, Pierre; Duggan, Laura V; Griesdale, Donald E; Hung, Orlando R; Jones, Philip M; Kovacs, George; Massey, Simon; Morris, Ian R; Mullen, Timothy; Murphy, Michael F; Preston, Roanne; Naik, Viren N; Scott, Jeanette; Stacey, Shean; Turkstra, Timothy P; Wong, David T",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-013-0020-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24132408/,251

145491,The clinical characteristics and course of COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients.,2020-07-30,"BACKGROUND Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major public health concern. eHealth interventions may reduce exposure to violence and health-related consequences as the technology provides a safe and flexible space for the target population. However, the evidence is unclear. OBJECTIVE The goal of the review is to examine the effect of eHealth interventions compared with standard care on reducing IPV, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among women exposed to IPV. METHODS We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycInfo, Scopus, Global Health Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for published and unpublished trials from inception until April 2019. Trials with an eHealth intervention targeting women exposed to violence were included. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Trials that reported effect estimates on overall IPV; physical, sexual, and psychological violence; depression; or posttraumatic stress disorder were included in meta-analyses. RESULTS A total of 14 trials were included in the review; 8 published trials, 3 unpublished trials and 3 ongoing trials. Of the 8 published trials, 2 were judged as overall low risk of bias trials. The trials reported 23 types of outcomes, and 7 of the trials had outcomes that were eligible for meta-analyses. Our pooled analyses found no effect of eHealth interventions on any of our prespecified outcomes: overall IPV (SMD -0.01; 95% CI -0.11 to 0.08; I2=0%; 5 trials, 1668 women); physical violence (SMD 0.01; 95% CI -0.22 to 0.24; I2=58%; 4 trials, 1128 women); psychological violence (SMD 0.07; 95% CI -0.12 to 0.25; I2=40%; 4 trials, 1129 women); sexual violence (MD 0.36; 95% CI -0.18 to 0.91; I2=0%; 2 trials, 1029 women); depression (SMD -0.13; 95% CI -0.37 to 0.11; I2=78%; 5 trials, 1600 women); and PTSD (MD -0.11; 95% CI -1.04 to 0.82; I2=0%; 5 trials, 1267 women).

145744,How the speed of word finding depends on ventral tract integrity in primary progressive aphasia.,2020,"Timely reporting, effective analyses and rapid distribution of surveillance data can assist in detecting the aberration of disease occurrence and further facilitate a timely response. In China, a new nationwide web-based automated system for outbreak detection and rapid response was developed in 2008. The China Infectious Disease Automated-alert and Response System (CIDARS) was developed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention based on the surveillance data from the existing electronic National Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System (NIDRIS) started in 2004. NIDRIS greatly improved the timeliness and completeness of data reporting with real-time reporting information via the Internet. CIDARS further facilitates the data analysis, aberration detection, signal dissemination, signal response and information communication needed by public health departments across the country. In CIDARS, three aberration detection methods are used to detect the unusual occurrence of 28 notifiable infectious diseases at the county level and transmit information either in real time or on a daily basis. The Internet, computers and mobile phones are used to accomplish rapid signal generation and dissemination, timely reporting and reviewing of the signal response results. CIDARS has been used nationwide since 2008; all Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in China at the county, prefecture, provincial and national levels are involved in the system. It assists with early outbreak detection at the local level and prompts reporting of unusual disease occurrences or potential outbreaks to CDCs throughout the country.","Yang, Weizhong; Li, Zhongjie; Lan, Yajia; Wang, Jinfeng; Ma, Jiaqi; Jin, Lianmei; Sun, Qiao; Lv, Wei; Lai, Shengjie; Liao, Yilan; Hu, Wenbiao",Western Pacific surveillance and response journal : WPSAR,https://doi.org/10.5365/wpsar.2010.1.1.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23908878/,251

METHODS This case-control study included newborns diagnosed with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China from January 2020 to July 2020. All included newborns had complete neurological evaluations and head magnetic resonance imaging. We normalized the extracted T2-weighted imaging data to a standard neonate template space, and segmented them into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. The comparison of gray matter volume was conducted between the two groups. RESULTS A total of five neonates with COVID-19 were included in this study. The median reflex scores were 2 points lower in the infected group than in the control group (P = 0.0094), and the median orientation and behavior scores were 2.5 points lower in the infected group than in the control group (P = 0.0008). There were also significant differences between the two groups in the total scale score (P = 0.0426). The caudate nucleus, parahippocampal gyrus, and thalamus had the strongest correlations with the Hammersmith neonatal neurologic examination (HNNE) score, and the absolute correlation coefficients between the gray matter volumes and each part of the HNNE score were all almost greater than 0.5. CONCLUSIONS We first compared the neurological performance of neonates with and without COVID-19 by quantitative neuroimaging and neurological examination methods. Considering the limited numbers of patients, more studies focusing on the structural or functional aspects of the virus in the central nervous system in different age groups will be carried out in the future.","Yan, Kai; Xiao, Fei-Fan; Jiang, Yu-Wei; Xiao, Tian-Tian; Zhang, Da-Jiang; Yuan, Wen-Hao; Shao, Jian-Bo; Cheng, Guo-Qiang; Zeng, Ling-Kong",World journal of pediatrics : WJP,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12519-021-00423-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740237/,251
146530,Editor's Choice.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Faster treatment with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is likely to improve outcomes. Optimizing prehospital triage by mobile stroke units (MSUs) may speed treatment times. The Benefits of Stroke Treatment Delivered Using a Mobile Stroke Unit (BEST-MSU) study was launched in May 2014 using the first MSU in the United States to compare stroke management using an MSU versus standard management (SM). Herein, we describe the results of the prespecified, nonrandomized run-in phase designed to obtain preliminary data on study logistics. METHODS The run-in phase consisted of 8 MSU weeks when all-patient care occurred on the MSU and 2 SM weeks when the MSU nurse met personnel on scene or at the emergency department to ensure comparability with MSU patients. Telemedicine was independently performed in 9 MSU cases. RESULTS Of 130 alerts, 24 MSU and 2 SM patients were enrolled. Twelve of 24 MSU patients received tPA on board; 4 were treated within 60 minutes of last seen normal, and 4 went on to endovascular treatment. There were no hemorrhagic complications. Four had primary intracerebral hemorrhage. Agreement on tPA eligibility between the onsite and telemedicine physician was 90%. CONCLUSIONS The run-in phase provided a tPA treatment rate of 1.5 patients per week, assured us that treatment within 60 minutes of onset is possible, and enabled enrollment of patients on SM weeks. We also recognized the opportunity to assess the effect of the MSU on endovascular treatment and intracerebral hemorrhage. Challenges include the need to control biased patient selection on MSU versus SM weeks and establish inter-rater agreement for tPA treatment using telemedicine.","Bowry, Ritvij; Parker, Stephanie; Rajan, Suja S; Yamal, Jose-Miguel; Wu, Tzu-Ching; Richardson, Laura; Noser, Elizabeth; Persse, David; Jackson, Kamilah; Grotta, James C",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.011093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26508753/,251
146546,Automatically Determining Lumbar Load during Physically Demanding Work: A Validation Study.,2021-04-02,"BACKGROUND Marked progress is achieved in understanding the physiopathology of COVID-19 that caused global pandemics. However, CD4+ T cell population that is critical for antibody response in COVID-19 is poorly understood. METHODS In this study, we provided a comprehensive analysis of peripheral CD4+ T cells of 13 COVID-19 convalescent patients, as defined as confirmed free of SARS-CoV-2 for 2-4 weeks, using flow cytometry, magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme antibody immunoassay and correlated the data with clinical characteristics. RESULTS We observed that relative to healthy individuals, convalescent patients displayed an altered peripheral CD4+ T cell spectrum. Specifically, consistent with other viral infections, cTFH1 cell associated with SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibodies, which was found to skew with disease severity as more severe individuals showed higher frequency of TEM and TFH-EM cells but a lower frequency of TCM, TFH-CM and TNaive cells, relative to mild and moderate patients. Interestingly, higher frequency of cTFH-EM cells correlated with lower number of recorded admission blood oxygen level in convalescent patients. These observations might constitute residual effects by which COVID-19 can impact the homeostasis of CD4+ T cells in the long-term and explain the highest ratio of class-switched virus-specific antibody producing individuals found in our severe COVID-19 cohort. CONCLUSION Together, our study demonstrated close connection between CD4+ T cells and antibody production in COVID-19 convalescents.

In this study, we compared the transcriptional profiles of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-infected monocytic cells against that infected by coronavirus 229E (CoV-229E). Total RNA was extracted from infected DC-SIGN-transfected monocytes (THP-1-DC-SIGN) at 6 and 24 h after infection, and the gene expression was profiled in oligonucleotide-based microarrays. Analysis of immune-related gene expression profiles showed that at 24 h after SARS-CoV infection: (1) IFN-α/β-inducible and cathepsin/proteasome genes were downregulated; (2) hypoxia/hyperoxia-related genes were upregulated; and (3) TLR/TLR-signaling, cytokine/cytokine receptor-related, chemokine/chemokine receptor-related, lysosome-related, MHC/chaperon-related, and fibrosis-related genes were differentially regulated.

147885,"Interplay between state anxiety, heart rate variability, and cognition: An ex-Gaussian analysis of response times.",2020-10-15,"BACKGROUND It is well established that hematocrit (Hct) influences whole blood thromboelastography (TEG) tracings. Previous studies showed hypercoagulable TEG tracings in anemic patients despite clinical expectations that anemia often prolongs bleeding. TEG is a viscoelastic assessment of clot kinetics, and Hct is the main determinant of whole blood viscosity. TEG changes in anemia may be an in vitro artifact due to Hct effect on blood viscosity rather than true in vivo changes in hemostasis. The effect of changes in whole blood viscosity on TEG independent of Hct is not well understood. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Twenty-one blood samples from seven dogs were manipulated to produce one of three Hct conditions (45, 20, and 10%). Each was tested in two situations: viscosity adjusted to normal by adding alginate (ALG) or dilution with equal volume of saline (SAL). Both samples were analyzed with TEG simultaneously. RESULTS Twenty percent Hct plus ALG and 10% Hct plus ALG were significantly more viscous than their SAL counterparts (p=0.0156). Ten percent Hct plus SAL, 20% Hct plus SAL, and 45% Hct plus SAL all had different viscosities (p=0.006). Twenty percent Hct plus SAL and 10% Hct plus SAL had significantly shorter K and higher angle, MA, and G compared to their ALG counterparts as well as 45% Hct plus SAL (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS ALG samples with low Hct, normal viscosity showed hypocoagulable tracings, whereas SAL samples with low Hct, low viscosity showed hypercoagulable tracings. TEG variables are influenced by whole blood viscosity altered with ALG, independently of Hct.","Brooks, Aimee C; Guillaumin, Julien; Cooper, Edward S; Couto, C Guillermo",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.12354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23901836/,251

Men with a large aneurysm >54 mm, either at first screen or during surveillance, are referred for intervention. The aim of the present study was to explore outcomes in these men and to see whether there was any regional variation in treatment rates and type of repair. METHODS The study cohort included all men referred to a vascular network with a large abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Basic demographic information, nurse assessment details, as well as outcome data were extracted from the national NAAASP IT system, AAA SMaRT, for analysis. RESULTS Some 3 026 men were referred for possible intervention (48% first screen, 52% surveillance). Some 448 men (13.3%) either declined (63, 2.1%), or were turned down for early intervention for various reasons (385, 12.7%). Some 8% were declined for medical reasons (true turn down rate). Men referred from surveillance were older, and more likely not to have had elective surgery within three months (16.0 vs. 11.2%; HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07-1.75, p = .011). Turn down rates did not vary among local programmes, when surveillance men were taken into account. Some 2 624 (87%) men had planned AAA repair, with a peri-operative mortality of 1.3%. Thirty day surgical mortality was lower after EVAR: 0.4% compared with 2.1% after open repair. The method of repair remained consistent year on year, with roughly equal numbers undergoing endovascular (50%) and open surgical repair (48%); 2% unknown. There was regional variation in the proportion treated by endovascular repair: from 20% to 97%. CONCLUSION The turn down rate after referral for treatment with a screen detected AAA was low, but there remains considerable regional variation in the proportion undergoing endovascular repair. Procedures were undertaken with low peri-operative mortality.","Meecham, Lewis; Jacomelli, Jo; Davis, Meryl; Pherwani, Arun; Lees, Tim; Earnshaw, Jonothan J",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejvs.2020.09.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594980/,251

DESIGN Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING In-person follow-up visits (before COVID-19 outbreak) to a rehabilitation hospital in Spain and on-line during COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS Community dwelling adults (≥ 18 years) with chronic SCI. OUTCOME MEASURES Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) and World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) were compared using the Wilcoxon ranked test or paired t-test when appropriate. RESULTS One hundred and seventy five people with SCI assessed on-line between June 2020 and November 2020 were compared to their own assessments before COVID-19. Participants reported significantly decreased Social Integration during COVID-19 compared to pre-pandemic scores (P = 0.037), with a small effect size (d = -0.15). Depression (measured using HADS) was significantly higher than before COVID-19 (P < 0.001) with a moderate effect size (d = -0.29).

OBJECTIVE The objectives of Prospective RELOC-AGE are to study housing choices and relocation and explore effects on active and healthy aging among men and women aged 55 years and older in Sweden considering relocation. METHODS The estimated sample (2800) will include people aged 55 years and older being listed for relocation at either of two housing companies: a local public housing company in Southern Sweden and a national condominium provider. Prospective RELOC-AGE has a 2-level longitudinal mixed methods design and includes quantitative surveys (implemented by a professional survey company) and a telephone interview for baseline data collection in 2021, with follow-ups with the same procedures in 2022 and 2023. The survey and interviews include questions related to present housing and neighborhood, relocation plans and expectations, a range of perspectives on active and healthy aging, and demographics. Linking to national registers will provide additional data on home help and health care use, objective housing, and neighborhood characteristics. To explore what housing attributes older adults considering relocation find important and to what extent when making their decisions on housing, we will develop a discrete choice experiment to be implemented with a subsample of participants. Further, a grounded theory approach will be applied to collect in-depth interview data from participants who have moved to another dwelling, within 6 months of the move. A follow-up interview 12 months later will focus on participants' deepened experience over time in terms of fulfilled expectations and relocation experiences. RESULTS As of submission of this protocol (June 2021), recruitment has commenced with approximately 960 respondents to the survey and ongoing telephone interviews. We anticipate recruitment and data collection based on surveys and interviews to continue during 2021. CONCLUSIONS Prospective RELOC-AGE has the capacity to generate new policy-relevant knowledge on associations of housing, relocation, and active and healthy aging.

149509,Chronic Immunosuppression and Potential Infection Risks in CSF1R-Related Leukoencephalopathy.,2021-06-01,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) nsp1 suppresses host gene expression in expressed cells by inhibiting translation and inducing endonucleolytic cleavage of host mRNAs, the latter of which leads to mRNA decay. We examined the biological functions of nsp1 in infected cells and its role in virus replication by using wild-type MERS-CoV and two mutant viruses with specific mutations in the nsp1; one mutant lacked both biological functions, while the other lacked the RNA cleavage function but retained the translation inhibition function. In Vero cells, all three viruses replicated efficiently with similar replication kinetics, while wild-type virus induced stronger host translational suppression and host mRNA degradation than the mutants, demonstrating that nsp1 suppressed host gene expression in infected cells. The mutant viruses replicated less efficiently than wild-type virus in Huh-7 cells, HeLa-derived cells, and 293-derived cells, the latter two of which stably expressed a viral receptor protein. In 293-derived cells, the three viruses accumulated similar levels of nsp1 and major viral structural proteins and did not induce IFN-β and IFN-λ mRNAs; however, both mutants were unable to generate intracellular virus particles as efficiently as wild-type virus, leading to inefficient production of infectious viruses. These data strongly suggest that the endonucleolytic RNA cleavage function of the nsp1 promoted MERS-CoV assembly and/or budding in a 293-derived cell line. MERS-CoV nsp1 represents the first CoV gene 1 protein that plays an important role in virus assembly/budding and is the first identified viral protein whose RNA cleavage-inducing function promotes virus assembly/budding.IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV represents a high public health threat. Because CoV nsp1 is a major viral virulence factor, uncovering the biological functions of MERS-CoV nsp1 could contribute to our understanding of MERS-CoV pathogenicity and spur development of medical countermeasures. Expressed MERS-CoV nsp1 suppresses host gene expression, but its biological functions for virus replication and effects on host gene expression in infected cells are largely unexplored. We found that nsp1 suppressed host gene expression in infected cells. Our data further demonstrated that nsp1, which was not detected in virus particles, promoted virus assembly or budding in a 293-derived cell line, leading to efficient virus replication. These data suggest that nsp1 plays an important role in MERS-CoV replication and possibly affects virus-induced diseases by promoting virus particle production in infected hosts. Our data, which uncovered an unexpected novel biological function of nsp1 in virus replication, contribute to further understanding of the MERS-CoV replication strategies.","Nakagawa, Keisuke; Narayanan, Krishna; Wada, Masami; Popov, Vsevolod L; Cajimat, Maria; Baric, Ralph S; Makino, Shinji",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01157-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30111568/,251

149849,Upcoming Events.,2020-08-01,"Multiple wearable devices for cardiovascular self-monitoring have been proposed over the years, with growing evidence showing their effectiveness in the detection of pathologies that would otherwise be unnoticed through standard routine exams. In particular, Electrocardiography (ECG) has been an important tool for such purpose. However, wearables have known limitations, chief among which are the need for a voluntary action so that the ECG trace can be taken, battery lifetime, and abandonment. To effectively address these, novel solutions are needed, which has recently paved the way for ""invisible"" (aka ""off-the-person"") sensing approaches. In this article we describe the design and experimental evaluation of a system for invisible ECG monitoring at home. For this purpose, a new sensor design was proposed, novel materials have been explored, and a proof-of-concept data collection system was created in the form of a toilet seat, enabling ECG measurements as an extension of the regular use of sanitary facilities, without requiring body-worn devices. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, measurements were performed using our system and a gold standard equipment, involving 10 healthy subjects. For the acquisition of the ECG signals on the toilet seat, polymeric electrodes with different textures were produced and tested. According to the results obtained, some of the textures did not allow the acquisition of signals in all users. However, a pyramidal texture showed the best results in relation to heart rate and ECG waveform morphology. For a texture that has shown 0% signal loss, the mean heart rate difference between the reference and experimental device was - 1.778 ± 4.654 Beats per minute (BPM); in terms of ECG waveform, the best cases present a Pearson correlation coefficient above 0.99.","Dos Santos Silva, Aline; Almeida, Hugo; da Silva, Hugo Plácido; Oliveira, António",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85697-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737660/,251
149902,Effectiveness of uterine tamponade devices for refractory postpartum haemorrhage after vaginal birth: a systematic review.,2021-06-24,"Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe critical condition with a high mortality that is currently in focus given that it is associated with mortality caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Neutrophils play a key role in the lung injury characteristic of non-COVID-19 ARDS and there is also accumulating evidence of neutrophil mediated lung injury in patients who succumb to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: We undertook a functional proteomic and metabolomic survey of circulating neutrophil populations, comparing patients with COVID-19 ARDS and non-COVID-19 ARDS to understand the molecular basis of neutrophil dysregulation. Results: Expansion of the circulating neutrophil compartment and the presence of activated low and normal density mature and immature neutrophil populations occurs in ARDS, irrespective of cause. Release of neutrophil granule proteins, neutrophil activation of the clotting cascade and upregulation of the Mac-1 platelet binding complex with formation of neutrophil platelet aggregates is exaggerated in COVID-19 ARDS. Importantly, activation of components of the neutrophil type I interferon responses is seen in ARDS following infection with SARS-CoV-2, with associated rewiring of neutrophil metabolism, and the upregulation of antigen processing and presentation. Whilst dexamethasone treatment constricts the immature low density neutrophil population, it does not impact upon prothrombotic hyperinflammatory neutrophil signatures. Conclusions: Given the crucial role of neutrophils in ARDS and the evidence of a disordered myeloid response observed in COVID-19 patients, this work maps the molecular basis for neutrophil reprogramming in the distinct clinical entities of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS.","Reyes, Leila; A Sanchez-Garcia, Manuel; Morrison, Tyler; Howden, Andy J M; Watts, Emily R; Arienti, Simone; Sadiku, Pranvera; Coelho, Patricia; Mirchandani, Ananda S; Zhang, Ailiang; Hope, David; Clark, Sarah K; Singleton, Jo; Johnston, Shonna; Grecian, Robert; Poon, Azin; McNamara, Sarah; Harper, Isla; Fourman, Max Head; Brenes, Alejandro J; Pathak, Shalini; Lloyd, Amy; Blanco, Giovanny Rodriguez; von Kriegsheim, Alex; Ghesquiere, Bart; Vermaelen, Wesley; Cologna, Camila T; Dhaliwal, Kevin; Hirani, Nik; Dockrell, David H; Whyte, Moira K B; Griffith, David; Cantrell, Doreen A; Walmsley, Sarah R",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16584.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33997298/,251
150026,Dendritic cells in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis: insights for a possible role in determining disease outcome.,2020-11-16,"BACKGROUND Intraoperative brain function monitoring with processed electroencephalogram (EEG) indices, such as the bispectral index (BIS) and patient state index (PSI), may improve characterization of the depth of sedation or anesthesia when compared to conventional physiologic monitors, such as heart rate and blood pressure. However, the clinical assessment of anesthetic depth may not always agree with available processed EEG indices. To concurrently compare the performance of BIS and SedLine monitors, we present a data collection system using shared individual generic sensors connected to a custom-built passive interface box. METHODS This prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized study will enroll 100 adult American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I-III patients presenting for elective procedures requiring general anesthesia. BIS and SedLine electrodes will be placed preoperatively according to manufacturer recommendations and their respective indices tracked throughout anesthesia induction, maintenance and emergence. The concordance between processed EEG indices and clinical assessments of anesthesia depth will be analyzed with chi-square and kappa statistic. DISCUSSION Prior studies comparing brain function monitoring devices have applied both sensors on the forehead of study subjects simultaneously. With limited space and common sensor locations between devices, it is not possible to place both commercial sensor arrays according to the manufacturer's recommendations, thus compromising the validity of these comparisons. This trial utilizes a custom interface allowing signals from sensors to be shared between BIS and SedLine monitors to provide an accurate comparison. Our results will also characterize the degree of agreement between processed EEG indices and clinical assessments of anesthetic depth as determined by the anesthesiologists' interpretations of acute changes in blood pressure and heart rate as well as the administration, or change to the continuous delivery, of medications at these timepoints. Patient factors (such as burst suppression state or low power EEG conditions from aging brain), surgical conditions (such as use of electrocautery), artifacts (such as electromyography), and anesthesia medications and doses (such as end-tidal concentration of volatile anesthetic or hypnotic infusion dose) that lead to lack of agreement will be explored as well.

150114,Response of individual airways in vivo to bronchial thermoplasty.,2021-02-25,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread rapidly all over the world in late 2019 and caused critical illness and death in some infected patients. This study aimed at examining several laboratory factors, especially inflammatory and immunological mediators, to identify severity and mortality associated biomarkers. Ninety-three hospitalized patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were classified based on disease severity. The levels of biochemical, hematological, immunological, and inflammatory mediators were assessed, and their association with severity and mortality were evaluated. Hospitalized patients were mostly men (77.4%) with an average (standard deviation) age of 59.14 (14.81) years. The mortality rate was significantly higher in critical patients (85.7%). Increased serum levels of blood sugar, urea, creatinine, uric acid, phosphorus, total bilirubin, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, lactic dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and procalcitonin were significantly prevalent (p=0.002, p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.014, p=0.047, p=0.003, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, P<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively) in COVID-19 patients. Decreased red blood cell, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were significantly prevalent among COVID-19 patients than healthy control subjects (p<0.001 for all). Troponin-I, interleukin-6, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), procalcitonin, and D-dimer showed a significant association with the mortality of patients with specificity and sensitivity more than 60%. Age, sex, underlying diseases, blood oxygen pressure, complete blood count along with C-reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and interleukin-6 evaluation help to predict the severity and required management for COVID-19 patients.

150163,Influence of Exposure at Different Altitudes on the Executive Function of Plateau Soldiers-Evidence From ERPs and Neural Oscillations.,2021,"OBJECTIVE To review all available original publications on the harms and benefits of subcutaneous (SC) hydration in older patients. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS All studies on SC hydration in older patients without restrictions on design or language. MEASUREMENTS The Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science databases and trial registries were searched from inception to November 5, 2019, and two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias of individual outcomes. RESULTS Thirty-one publications from 29 studies met the eligibility criteria. The data from six randomized controlled trials were used for the meta-analyses. The subgroup analysis including only the studies with the lowest risk of bias showed that SC hydration was associated with fewer adverse effects than intravenous (IV) hydration (risk ratio (RR) = 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53-0.88; P = .003; n = 4; I2 = 0.0%; 545 infusions in each group). In absolute numbers, patients treated with SC hydration had an incidence rate of 90 adverse effects per 1,000 infusions versus 130 adverse effects per 1,000 infusions (95% CI = 102-169) with IV hydration. Secondary outcomes comparing IV with SC hydration showed that SC was 3.2 minutes faster to set up and markedly reduced the risk of agitation (RR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.22-0.79; P = .007; I2 = 65%; n = 3); however, SC hydration delivered a lower volume of fluid and was less efficient at reducing serum osmolality (s-osmolality). CONCLUSIONS SC hydration is safer than IV hydration and potentially reduces the risk of agitation, but it is less effective. SC hydration should be available as an alternative to IV hydration when treating older patients for mild-to-moderate dehydration. More high-quality studies are needed in the field to increase the confidence in the estimates.","Danielsen, Mathias Brix; Andersen, Stig; Worthington, Elisa; Jorgensen, Martin Gronbech",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.16707; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411351/,251

METHODS We designed a prospective multicenter cohort study of pregnant women with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who were admitted to 12 Italian maternity hospitals between February 23 and March 28, 2020. Clinical records, laboratory and radiologic examinations, and pregnancy outcomes were collected. A subgroup of patients with severe disease was identified based on intensive care unit (ICU) admission, delivery for respiratory compromise, or both. RESULTS Seventy-seven patients were included, 14 of whom had severe disease (18%). Two thirds of the patients in the cohort were admitted during the third trimester, and 84% were symptomatic on admission. Eleven patients underwent urgent delivery for respiratory compromise (16%), and six were admitted to the ICU (8%). One woman received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; no deaths occurred. Preterm delivery occurred in 12% of patients, and nine newborns were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Patients in the severe subgroup had significantly higher pregestational body mass indexes (BMIs) and heart and respiratory rates and a greater frequency of fever or dyspnea on admission compared with women with a nonsevere disease evolution. CONCLUSION In our cohort, one in five women hospitalized with COVID-19 infection delivered urgently for respiratory compromise or were admitted to the ICU. None, however, died. Increased pregestational BMI and abnormal heart and respiratory rates on admission were associated with severe disease.","Savasi, Valeria M; Parisi, Francesca; Patanè, Luisa; Ferrazzi, Enrico; Frigerio, Luigi; Pellegrino, Antonio; Spinillo, Arsenio; Tateo, Saverio; Ottoboni, Mariacristina; Veronese, Paola; Petraglia, Felice; Vergani, Patrizia; Facchinetti, Fabio; Spazzini, Donata; Cetin, Irene",Obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000003979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32433453/,251
150919,Effect of volume status on the estimation of mean systemic filling pressure.,2019,"BACKGROUND Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease primarily occurring in children, and commonly involves the bone and skin; gastrointestinal tract involvement is notably rare. The incidence and significance of gastrointestinal lesions in adult LCH are unclear; thus, we aimed to investigate adult Japanese cases of LCH and clarify the features of gastrointestinal involvement. METHODS We gathered clinical information on 43 Japanese cases of adult LCH and analyzed patient backgrounds, affected organs, features of the gastrointestinal lesions, and the clinical courses. RESULTS Thirteen patients underwent endoscopic examinations: an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy alone in 5, lower gastrointestinal endoscopy alone in 3, and both in 5 patients. A gastric lesion (one case), colonic lesion (one case), and both gastric and rectal lesions (one case) were detected. The three cases of gastrointestinal involvement also exhibited nongastrointestinal multisystem LCH lesions and showed no gastrointestinal symptoms or increased uptake on positron emission tomography. Endoscopy revealed small erosions without specific features; histological examinations were required for diagnosis. These three cases were treated with chemotherapy, comprising vinblastine/prednisolone, methotrexate, and daily 6-mercaptopurine, for 36 weeks; in two cases, the clinical condition remained stable for several years post-treatment. One case showed recurrence 1 year 7 months after treatment, and chemotherapy was re-administered. No case with single-system disease exhibited gastrointestinal involvement. CONCLUSIONS Although gastrointestinal LCH lesions are rare, they were more common than expected in our cases of multisystem LCH. However, these lesions were relatively small and did not affect the patients' clinical courses.","Matsubara, Yasuo; Kobayashi, Masayuki; Hijikata, Yasuki; Ota, Yasunori; Hirata, Yoshihiro; Lim, Lay Ahyoung; Yotsuyanagi, Hiroshi; Tojo, Arinobu",International journal of clinical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10147-020-01739-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901339/,251

The role of NETs in trauma and trauma-induced hypercoagulability is unknown. We hypothesized that trauma patients with accelerated thrombin generation would have increased NETosis and syndecan-1 levels. METHODS In this pilot study, we analyzed 50 citrated plasma samples from 30 trauma patients at 0 h (n = 22) and 6 h (n = 28) from time of injury (TOI) and 21 samples from healthy volunteers, for a total of 71 samples included in analysis. Thrombin generation was quantified using calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT) and reported as lag time (LT), peak height (PH), and time to peak (ttPeak). Nucleosome calibrated (H3NUC) and free histone standardized (H3Free) ELISAs were used to quantify NETs. Syndecan-1 levels were quantified by ELISA. Results are presented as median [interquartile range] and Spearman rank correlations. RESULTS Plasma levels of H3NUC were increased in trauma patients as compared to healthy volunteers both at 0 h (89.8 ng/mL [35.4, 180.3]; 18.1 ng/mL [7.8, 37.4], p = 0.002) and at 6 h (86.5 ng/mL [19.2, 612.6]; 18.1 ng/mL [7.8, 37.4], p = 0.003) from TOI. H3Free levels were increased in trauma patients at 0 h (5.74 ng/mL [3.19, 8.76]; 1.61 ng/mL [0.66, 3.50], p = 0.002) and 6 h (5.52 ng/mL [1.46, 11.37]; 1.61 ng/mL [0.66, 3.50], p = 0.006). Syndecan-1 levels were greater in trauma patients (4.53 ng/mL [3.28, 6.28]; 2.40 ng/mL [1.66, 3.20], p < 0.001) only at 6 h from TOI. H3Free and syndecan-1 levels positively correlated both at 0 h (0.376, p = 0.013) and 6 h (0.583, p < 0.001) from TOI. H3NUC levels and syndecan-1 levels were positively correlated at 6 h from TOI (0.293, p = 0.041). TtPeak correlated inversely to H3 NUC (-0.358, p = 0.012) and syndecan-1 levels (-0.298, p = 0.038) at 6 h from TOI.

METHODS We included consecutive patients (2014-2016) with an anterior circulation occlusion undergoing EVT from the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) Registry. We assessed the effect of age (dichotomized at ≥80 years and as continuous variable) on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and reperfusion rate. The association between age and mRS was assessed with multivariable ordinal logistic regression, and a multiplicative interaction term was added to the model to assess modification of reperfusion by age on outcome. RESULTS Of the 1,526 patients, 380 (25%) were ≥80 years of age (referred to here as older adults). Older adults had a worse functional outcome than younger patients (adjusted common odds ratio [acOR] for an mRS score shift toward better outcome 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.39). Mortality was also higher in older adults (51% vs 22%, adjusted odds ratio 3.12, 95% CI 2.33-4.19). There were no differences in proportion of patients with mRS scores of 4 to 5, sICH, or reperfusion rates. Successful reperfusion was more strongly associated with a shift toward good functional outcome in older adults than in younger patients (acOR 3.22, 95% CI 2.04-5.10 vs 2.00, 95% CI 1.56-2.57, p interaction = 0.026). CONCLUSION Older age is associated with an increased absolute risk of poor clinical outcome, while the relative benefit of successful reperfusion seems to be higher in these patients.

151758,Why there are no effective herbal antidotes against snake venom available in India?,2020-06-01,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that adjuvant radioimmunotherapy (RIT) prevents recurrent liver metastases and/or results in improved survival after tumorectomy in an experimental model. BACKGROUND Although partial hepatectomy can improve 5-year survival of patients with colorectal liver metastases up to 58%, recurrent tumor growth in the liver occurs frequently. Radioimmunotherapy using radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies directed against tumor-associated antigens is considered most suited for treating minimal residual disease and could therefore serve as an adjuvant after surgery. METHODS Liver metastases were induced in male Wag/Rij rats by a mini-laparotomy with intrahepatic injection of 0.3 × 106 CC531 tumor cells. The biodistribution of the radiolabeled monoclonal antibody MG1, directed against a 80-kDa cell surface antigen on CC531 tumors, in this model was determined at 1, 3, and 7 days after intravenous administration. The therapeutic efficacy of 177Lu-MG1 was compared with that of a sham antibody (UPC10), labeled with the same activity dose of Lu-177, and saline only. Radioimmunotherapy was administered either at the day of the tumorectomy (day 14 after tumor cell inoculation) or 7 days later. Primary endpoint was survival. RESULTS Radiolabeled MG1 preferentially accumulated in tumor lesions in the liver reaching a maximum 3 days postinjection (8.7 ± 0.6% injected dose per gram). Both the administration of 177Lu-MG1 and 177Lu-UPC10 resulted in a transient decrease in body weight. No other signs of clinical discomfort were registered. The survival curves of the group that received 177Lu-UPC10 and the group that received saline only did not differ (P=0.886). Administration of RIT immediately after surgery improved survival compared to administration of the control antibody (hazard ratio [HR], 1.54; P = 0.051), which was even more pronounced when survival was adjusted for the weight of the resected tumor (HR, 1.71; P = 0.027). A therapeutic efficacy of delayed treatment seemed likely (HR, 2.34; P = 0.055). Survival after early administration did not differ from delayed administration (HR, 1.16; P = 0.763). CONCLUSION This study provides proof of principle that RIT can be an effective adjuvant treatment modality after surgical treatment of colorectal liver metastases.","de Jong, Gabie M; Hendriks, Thijs; Eek, Annemarie; Oyen, Wim J G; Nagtegaal, Iris D; Bleichrodt, Robert P; Boerman, Otto C",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e3181ff313a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21217519/,251

In the past decade, different positron-emitting tomography (PET) tracers have been developed. The largest group is the (68)Gallium-labeled somatostatin analogs ((68)Ga-SSA). Several studies have demonstrated their superiority compared to SRS in sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, patient comfort and effective dose are favorable for (68)Ga-SSA.

152260,Stroking Out While Black-The Complex Role of Racism.,2020-08-21,"Virus-host interactions involve complex interplay between viral and host factors, rendering them an ideal target for proteomic analysis. Here we detail a high throughput quantitative proteomics analysis of Vero cells infected with the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a positive strand RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm. Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) was used in conjunction with LC-MS/MS to identify and quantify 1830 cellular and two viral proteins from IBV-infected cells. Fractionation of cells into cytoplasmic, nuclear, and nucleolar extracts was used to reduce sample complexity and provide information on the trafficking of proteins between the different compartments. Each fraction showed a proportion of proteins exhibiting >or=2-fold changes in abundance. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that proteins that changed in response to infection could be grouped into different functional categories. These included proteins regulated by NF-kappaB- and AP-1-dependent pathways and proteins involved in the cytoskeleton and molecular motors. A luciferase-based reporter gene assay was used to validate the up-regulation of AP-1- and NF-kappaB-dependent transcription in IBV-infected cells and confirmed using immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence was used to validate changes in the subcellular localization of vimentin and myosin VI in IBV-infected cells. The proteomics analysis also confirmed the presence of the viral nucleocapsid protein as localizing in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and nucleolus and the viral membrane protein in the cytoplasmic fraction. This research is the first application of SILAC to study total host cell proteome changes in response to positive sense RNA virus infection and illustrates the versatility of this technique as applied to infectious disease research.","Emmott, Edward; Rodgers, Mark A; Macdonald, Andrew; McCrory, Sarah; Ajuh, Paul; Hiscox, Julian A",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.m900345-mcp200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20467043/,251

One possible way to decrease the LoD is to optimize nanoparticle properties that are used as labels. We compare two types of Au nanoparticles: usual quasispherical gold nanoparticles (C-GNPs), obtained by the Turkevich-Frens method, and superspherical gold nanoparticles (S-GNPs), obtained by a progressive overgrowth technique. Average diameters were 18.6-47.5 nm for C-GNPs and 20.2-90.4 nm for S-GNPs. Cardiomarker troponin I was considered as the target analyte. Adsorption and covalent conjugation with antibodies were tested for both GNP types. For C-GNPs, the minimal LoD was obtained with 33.7 nm nanoparticles, reaching 12.7 ng/mL for covalent immobilization and 9.9 ng/mL for adsorption. The average diameter of S-GNPs varied from 20.2 to 64.5 nm, which resulted in a decrease in LoD for an LFIA of troponin I from 3.4 to 1.2 ng/mL for covalent immobilization and from 2.9 to 2.0 ng/mL for adsorption. Thus, we obtained an 8-fold decrease in LoD (9.9 to 1.2 ng/mL) by using S-GNPs. This effect can be related to more effective antibody immobilization and improved S-GNP optical properties. The obtained results can improve LFIAs for various practically significant analytes.","Byzova, Nadezhda A; Zherdev, Anatoly V; Khlebtsov, Boris N; Burov, Andrey M; Khlebtsov, Nikolai G; Dzantiev, Boris B",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20123608; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604874/,251

By combining atomic force microscopy AFM and quartz crystal microbalance, we show that at low ionic strengths the conformational change of grafted polyions is non-monotonic with increasing pH due to the counterintuitive variation of the ionization degree. Thus, reentrant swelling of the polymer chains is observed with increasing pH. This effect is more important at low polymer grafting densities, when it is accompanied by in-plane heterogeneous distribution at intermediate pH values. In addition, we observed self-assembly on the polymer brush (formation of holes and islands) at pH values below pKa, due to the short-range attractive interaction between uncharged grafted chains. The sensitivity of the ionization of grafted chains to the physicochemical environment was also studied by measuring the interaction force between a silica tip and polymer brushes by atomic force microscopy. The dependence of the ionization of polyions on the presence of the tip points toward important charge regulation effects, in particular at pH values corresponding to partial ionization of the polyion.","Senechal, Vincent; Saadaoui, Hassan; Vargas-Alfredo, Nelson; Rodriguez-Hernandez, Juan; Drummond, Carlos",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0sm00810a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735003/,251

153051,"Errors in Abstract, Results, and End Matter.",2020-09-01,"Accurate detection of mediated haptic information in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is critical for applying appropriate force magnitudes onto soft tissue with the aim of minimising tissue trauma. Force perception in MIS is a dynamic process, with surgeons' administration of force into tissue revealing information about the remote surgical site which further informs the surgeons' haptic interactions. The relationship between applied force and material deformation rate provides biomechanical information specifying the deformation distance remaining until a tissue will fail: which is termed distance-to-break (DTB). The current study demonstrates that observers can detect DTB while deforming simulated tissues and stop before reaching the tissues' failure points. The design of training simulators, control devices and automated robotic systems for applications outside of MIS is discussed.

153139,A Radiation Mitigator as a Potential Treatment for COVID-19.,2020-04-30,"BACKGROUND Bronchoscopic valve placement constitutes an effective endoscopic lung volume reduction (ELVR) therapy in patients with severe emphysema and low collateral ventilation. After occluding the most destroyed lobe with valves, significant target lobe volume reduction leads to improvements in lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life. In some patients, the effects are not consistent leading to long-term therapy failure. We hypothesized that surgical lung volume reduction (LVRS) would re-establish ELVR short-term clinical improvements following ELVR long-term failure. METHODS In this retrospective single-center analysis, we included all patients who underwent consolidating lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) by lobectomy after long-term failure of valve therapy between 2010 and 2015. Changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), residual volume (RV), 6-min walking distance (6MWD), and dyspnea score (mMRC) 90 days after ELVR and LVRS were analyzed, and the outcomes of both procedures were compared. RESULTS A total of 20 patients underwent LVRS after ELVR failure. In the majority (90%), a lower lobectomy was performed. The 30-day mortality of the cohort was 0% and 90-day mortality 5% (1/20). The remaining 19 patients showed a significant increase in FEV1 (+27.5 ± 19.4%) and reduction in RV (-21.0 ± 17.4%) and TLC (-11.1 ± 11.1%). This resulted in significant improvements in exercise tolerance (6MWD: +56 ± 60 m) and relief of dyspnea (ΔmMRC: -1.8 ± 1.4 pts.). CONCLUSIONS Consolidating LVRS by lobectomy after failure of previously successful ELVR is feasible and results in significant symptom relief and improvement of lung function.","Eichhorn, Martin E; Gompelmann, Daniela; Hoffmann, Hans; Dreher, Sascha; Hornemann, Katrin; Haag, Johannes; Kontogianni, Konstantina; Heussel, Claus P; Winter, Hauke; Herth, Felix J F; Eberhardt, Ralf",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.06.148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991839/,251

Renal nerve ablation technology is being developed for treatment of drug-treatment-resistant hypertension worldwide. Preliminary research with the use of radiofrequency-based renal denervation systems have demonstrated encouraging results with significant reduction of blood pressure in patients inadequately controlled despite nearly maximal drug therapy regimens. From work done thus far, the renal denervation procedure has not been associated with serious adverse effects. Long-term efficacy and safety still needs to be established for renal nerve ablation.

154022,How can multidisciplinary management with remote monitoring improve the outcome of patients with chronic cardiac diseases?,2020-01-24,"Viral infections universally rely on numerous hijacked host factors to be successful. It is therefore possible to control viral infections by manipulating host factors that are critical for viral replication. Given that host genes may play essential roles in certain cellular processes, any successful manipulations for virus control should cause no or mild effects on host fitness. We previously showed that a group of positive-strand RNA viruses enrich phosphatidylcholine (PC) at the sites of viral replication. Specifically, brome mosaic virus (BMV) replication protein 1a interacts with and recruits a PC synthesis enzyme phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase, Cho2p, to the viral replication sites that are assembled on the perinuclear ER membrane. Deletion of the CHO2 gene inhibited BMV replication by 5-fold, however, slowed down cell growth as well. Here, we show that an engineered Cho2p mutant supports general PC synthesis and normal cell growth but blocks BMV replication. This mutant interacts and co-localizes with BMV 1a but prevents BMV 1a from localizing to the perinuclear ER membrane. The mislocalized BMV 1a fails to induce the formation of viral replication complexes. Our study demonstrates an effective antiviral strategy in which a host lipid synthesis gene is engineered to control viral replication without comprising host growth.","He, Guijuan; Zhang, Zhenlu; Sathanantham, Preethi; Zhang, Xin; Wu, Zujian; Xie, Lianhui; Wang, Xiaofeng",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra118.007051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362985/,251

METHOD In this exploratory cross-sectional study, data from 13 Canadian and 22 Dutch children with spina bifida (14 females, 21 males; mean age 10y 11mo, standard deviation [SD] 3y 6mo, range 5y 6mo-18y; Hoffer classification distribution: community [n=28], household [n=3], non-functional [n=3], and non-ambulator [n=1]) were analysed. Objective measures of physical activity and sedentary behaviour were obtained by using ActiGraph or Actiheart activity monitors. Data for the participants wearing the ActiGraph were compared with age- and sex-matched controls that were developing typically using independent-samples t-tests. Activity data collected on weekdays was compared to those on weekends. RESULTS ActiGraph data demonstrated children with spina bifida spent more time sedentary (mean [SD] 49.5min/h [5.78]) and less time in moderate to vigorous physical activity (mean [SD] 2.33min/h [1.61]) compared with the typically developing group (mean [SD] 41.0min/h [5.76] and 5.46min/h [2.13], p=0.001 and p<0.001 respectively). For both ActiGraph- and Actiheart-derived data, physical activity and sedentary time were not significantly different between weekdays and weekends. INTERPRETATION Children with spina bifida have reduced levels of physical activity and increased sedentary behaviour, with no statistical differences seen between weekdays and weekends. Several methodological issues related to activity monitoring warrant consideration when choosing the appropriate method to quantify physical activity and sedentary behaviour. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS Reduced levels of physical activity and sedentary time were quantified in children with spina bifida. Objective quantification of physical behaviour in ambulatory and non-ambulatory school-aged children with spina bifida is possible.","Claridge, Everett A; Bloemen, Manon At; Rook, Rosanne A; Obeid, Joyce; Timmons, Brian W; Takken, Tim; Van Den Berg-Emons, Rita Jg; De Groot, Janke F; Gorter, Jan Willem",Developmental medicine and child neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/dmcn.14333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31468507/,251

It results from the loss of UBE3A protein, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in neurons of the brain. Despite the dynamic spatiotemporal expression of UBE3A observed in rodents and the potential clinical importance of when and where it is expressed, its expression pattern in humans remains unknown. This reflects a common challenge of studying human neurodevelopment: prenatal periods are hard to access experimentally. In this work, human cerebral organoids reveal a change from weak to strong UBE3A in neuronal nuclei within 3 weeks of culture. Angelman syndrome human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids also exhibit early silencing of paternal UBE3A, with topoisomerase inhibitors partially rescuing UBE3A levels and calcium transient phenotypes. This work establishes human cerebral organoids as an important model for studying UBE3A and motivates their broader use in understanding complex neurodevelopmental disorders.","Sen, Dilara; Voulgaropoulos, Alexis; Drobna, Zuzana; Keung, Albert J",Stem cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2020.08.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916124/,251

Robotic-assisted surgery may offer potential benefits to this operation. This study describes the comparison of robotic-assisted and conventional laparoscopic ventral rectopexy in terms of clinical parameters, operative details, postoperative complications and short-term outcomes. METHODS Twenty patients operated on for rectal prolapse or intussusception using the Da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale CA, USA) were prospectively followed for 3 months. The cases were pair-matched with laparoscopically operated controls from registry files. RESULTS Mean operating time was 159 min (standard deviation; ±37 SD) and 153 min (±33 SD) and mean total time in the operating theatre 231 min (±39 SD) and 234 min (±41 SD) for robotic-assisted and laparoscopic operations, respectively. Mean blood loss was 25 ml (±49 SD) in robotic-assisted and 37 ml (±50 SD) in laparoscopic procedures. There was one (5 %) significant complication in each group. Mean length of hospital stay was 3.1 (±2 SD) and 3.3 (±1.3 SD) days for the robotic-assisted and laparoscopic groups, respectively. The subjective benefit rate was the same in both groups: 16/20 (80 %). One patient in the robotic-assisted group continued to have symptoms of obstructed defecation, and there was one recurrence of prolapse in the laparoscopic group. CONCLUSIONS Robotic-assisted laparoscopic ventral rectopexy is safe, feasible and not more time consuming than the laparoscopic technique even at the beginning of the learning curve. The short-term results are comparable with those of laparoscopy. We found no arguments to support the routine use of robotic assistance in rectopexy operations.","Mäkelä-Kaikkonen, J; Rautio, T; Klintrup, K; Takala, H; Vierimaa, M; Ohtonen, P; Mäkelä, J",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-013-1042-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23839795/,251

Understanding the factors associated with social disconnection by living arrangement could help identify vulnerable older adults in the community. We examined the sociodemographic and health factors associated with social disconnection among two groups of older adults: those living alone and those living with others. METHODS We used data from 16,943 community-dwelling older adults from the third follow-up of the Singapore Chinese Health Study (mean age: 73 years, range: 61-96 years). We defined social disconnection as having no social participation and scoring in the lowest decile on the Duke Social Support Scale of perceived social support. We ran logistic regression models to study the sociodemographic (age, gender, and education) and health (self-rated health, instrumental limitations, cognitive function, and depression) factors associated with social disconnection, stratified by living arrangement. RESULTS About 6% of our participants were socially disconnected. Although living alone was significantly associated with social disconnection (OR 1.93, 95% CI: 1.58-2.35), 85.6% of socially disconnected older adults lived with others, most of them (92%) with family. Lower education level, cognitive impairment, fair/poor self-rated health, instrumental limitations, and depression were independently associated with social disconnection. Among those living alone, men were more likely to experience social disconnection than women (OR 2.18, 95% CI: 1.43-3.32). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION Though living alone is associated with social disconnection, most socially disconnected individuals lived with family. Community interventions could focus on those in poor health despite living with family and older men living alone.","Barrenetxea, Jon; Yang, Yi; Pan, An; Feng, Qiushi; Koh, Woon-Puay",Gerontology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000516626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134122/,251

After 2015, the prevalence of the genogroup 2b (G2b) PEDVs decreased in a cyclical pattern with endemic seasonal outbreaks occasionally seen. To better understand the genetic diversity of PEDVs recently circulating in Taiwan, full-length spike (S) genes of 31 PEDV strains from 28 pig farms collected during 2016-2018 were sequenced. While the majority of S gene sequences (from 27/28 farms) were closely related to the previous G2b PEDV strains, increased genetic diversities leading to several nonsynonymous mutations scattering in the neutralizing epitopes of the S gene were detected in PEDVs recently circulating in Taiwan. Furthermore, novel recombinant variants, the PEDV TW/Yunlin550/2018 strains exhibiting recombinant events between a previously isolated Taiwan PEDV G2b strain and a wild-type PEDV G1a strain, were identified and further classified into a new genogroup, G1c. These results provide updated information about the genetic diversity of currently circulating PEDVs in the field and could help to develop more suitable strategies for controlling this disease.","Hsueh, Fu-Chun; Lin, Chao-Nan; Chiou, Hue-Ying; Chia, Min-Yuan; Chiou, Ming-Tang; Haga, Takashi; Kao, Chi-Fei; Chang, Yen-Chen; Chang, Chia-Yu; Jeng, Chian-Ren; Chang, Hui-Wen",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31538715/,251

METHODS Retrospective data were retrieved from the medical records of 26 horses undergoing colectomy, including 14 horses with sutured end-to-end and 12 horses with stapled functional end-to-end anastomoses, between 2003 and 2016. Records were evaluated for signalment, medical and surgical treatments, and survival to hospital discharge. Long-term follow-up was obtained through owner contact. Continuous variables were compared with Mann-Whitney tests. Fisher's exact testing was used to compare survival to hospital discharge. Survival time was compared by constructing Kaplan-Meier survival curves and performing log-rank curve comparison testing. RESULTS Mean age of horses undergoing colectomy was 13 years. Reason for colectomy was prophylaxis (12) or salvage (14). Mean surgical time was 169 minutes. Mean hospitalization time was 9 days, which did not differ with anastomosis type (P = .62). Nine of 12 horses undergoing stapled functional end-to-end anastomosis and 12 of 14 horses undergoing sutured end-to-end anastomosis survived to hospital discharge (P = .63).

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Thermograms were taken pre and post exercise with and without a BFR cuff on separate legs. BFR cuff pressure was set at 80% maximal arterial occlusion pressure determined using doppler via the tibial artery. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the effect of BFR and time post-exercise on skin-temperature (Tskin). RESULTS A lower Tskin was seen following BFR exercise at the tendon insertion (P = 0.002), but not at the free tendon (P = 0.234), or the musculotendinous junction (P = 0.933). A significant effect of time upon changes in Tskin was observed in both BFR and non-BFR groups (P = 0.002). No interaction of time and BFR were observed on changes in Tskin (P = 0.726). CONCLUSION Region specific changes in Tskin were found, with greater and longer reductions observed at the insertion of the Achilles following BFR exercise before returning to baseline. These findings could have implications for the programming of BFR exercise on tendon health.

West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of domestically acquired arboviral disease in the United States (1). Other arboviruses, including La Crosse, Jamestown Canyon, Powassan, eastern equine encephalitis, and St. Louis encephalitis viruses, cause sporadic disease and occasional outbreaks. This report summarizes surveillance data for nationally notifiable domestic arboviruses reported to CDC for 2019. For 2019, 47 states and the District of Columbia (DC) reported 1,173 cases of domestic arboviral disease, including 971 (83%) WNV disease cases. Among the WNV disease cases, 633 (65%) were classified as neuroinvasive disease, for a national incidence of 0.19 cases per 100,000 population, 53% lower than the median annual incidence during 2009-2018. More Powassan and eastern equine encephalitis virus disease cases were reported in 2019 than in any previous year. Health care providers should consider arboviral infections in patients with aseptic meningitis or encephalitis, perform recommended diagnostic testing, and promptly report cases to public health authorities. Because arboviral diseases continue to cause serious illness, and annual incidence of individual viruses continues to vary with sporadic outbreaks, maintaining surveillance is important in directing prevention activities. Prevention depends on community and household efforts to reduce vector populations and personal protective measures to prevent mosquito and tick bites such as use of Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellent and wearing protective clothing.*,†.","Vahey, Grace M; Mathis, Sarabeth; Martin, Stacey W; Gould, Carolyn V; Staples, J Erin; Lindsey, Nicole P",MMWR.

158117,Crusted Scabies Complicated with Herpes Simplex and Sepsis.,2020,"OBJECTIVE To describe and analyse factors associated with the duration of disease onset to hospital admission, admission to discharge and admission to death for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), using the recently developed comprehensive database covering all regions of mainland China, and compare the results within and outside China. METHODS The database included all probable 5327 SARS cases, of whom 343 died. Linear regression (uni- and multivariate analysis) was performed for all three durations to test the impact of the following variables: sex, age, occupation, geographic location and period of the SARS epidemic (time since the first case, i.e. 16 November 2002). RESULTS The average duration of onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 3.8 days, of admission to discharge for those who survived was 29.7 days, while admission to death for casualties was 17.4 days. Health care workers, patients from Tianjin and patients infected towards the end of the epidemic had the shortest duration of onset to admission. Regarding admission to discharge, particularly young patients and patients from Guangdong had the shortest duration. Older age was the sole factor associated with shorter duration of admission to death. CONCLUSIONS The average duration and pattern (with time of epidemic and age) of onset of symptoms to hospital admission of SARS patients in mainland China were comparable to other affected areas. The duration of hospital admission to discharge was shorter than elsewhere, possibly because of different hospitalisation policies. The duration of hospital admission to death in mainland China, however, appeared to be shorter than in other areas, which is in striking contrast to the much lower case fatality in mainland China.","Feng, Dan; Jia, Na; Fang, Li-Qun; Richardus, Jan Hendrik; Han, Xiao-Na; Cao, Wu-Chun; de Vlas, Sake J",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02188.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19508437/,251

This study aimed (a) to investigate the effectiveness of treatment options within an algorithm-guided treatment (AGT) program for depression and compare their effectiveness with outcomes of efficacy trials and (b) to assess the relation between treatment continuity and outcomes. METHODS This naturalistic study linked treatment data from January 2012 to November 2014 from a Dutch mental healthcare provider, to routine outcome monitoring (ROM) data (N = 351). Effectiveness of the treatment options (pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and their combination) was compared to the efficacy reported in the meta-analyses. We included treatment continuity as binary variable ""early terminators versus completers of the recommended number of treatment sessions"". RESULTS Remission rates for psychotherapy (38% [95% CI: 32-45]), pharmacotherapy (31% [95% CI: 22-42]) and combination therapy (46% [95% CI: 19-75]) were respectively lower, comparable, and comparable to those reported in the meta-analyses. Similarly, response rates were respectively lower (24% [95% CI: 19-30]), lower (21% [95% CI: 13-31]), and comparable (46% [95% CI: 19-75]) to meta-analyses results. A similar share of early terminators and completers achieved remission and response. LIMITATIONS A substantial proportion of patients had incomplete ROM data after data linkage. Limited set of patient characteristics to check for selection bias. CONCLUSIONS Despite the more heterogeneous patient population in clinical practice, the effectiveness of an AGT program, emphasizing strict guideline adherence, approached that found in RCTs.

The mechanism behind the impact of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on glucose metabolism is unclear. Hence, we aimed to investigate the triangle relationship between the RBP4, glucose metabolism, and LSG in patients of Chinese ethnicity. Methods The study enrolled eighty-two obese patients. Glucose-lipid metabolic index, uric acid (UA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxin (FT4) and thyrotropin (TSH) were measured. RBP4 levels were detected by enzyme-link immunosorbent assay. 30 obese patients underwent LSG were studied. All these markers were measured again at a time interval of 3 and 6 months after surgery. Results (1) Circulating RBP4 levels were positively associated with body mass index(BMI), blood glucose in 0 min (BG0), BG30, BG120, BG180, fasting inulin(FINS), fasting C peptide(FCP), homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), SOD, TSH and negatively associated with Matsuda index in obesity with a significant difference (P < 0.05). RBP4 levels in the patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia were significantly higher than the patients without IFG, insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia (P = 0.035, P = 0.001, and P = 0.007). (2) LSG resulted in significantly decreased FBG, FINS, FCP and HOMA-IR at 3, 6 months after surgery (all P < 0.05). The RBP4 levels were significantly decreased after surgery (all P < 0.05) with no gender difference. (3) The change in RBP4 levels was significantly associated with the change in FINS, FCP, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β at 6 months and the change in TSH at 3 months after surgery in males (all P < 0.05). The change in RBP4 levels were significantly associated with the change in FINS, FCP, HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, and TCH at 3 months after surgery in females (all P < 0.05). Conclusions Overall, our results interpret the significant correlations between RBP4, glucose-lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and thyroid function in obese patients. Further, the LSG brings a decline in RBP4 levels and that may contribute partly to the improved insulin resistance in obese Chinese patients.","Wang, Xingchun; Huang, Yueye; Gao, Jingyang; Sun, Hang; Jayachandran, Muthukumaran; Qu, Shen",Diabetology & metabolic syndrome,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13098-019-0511-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31956345/,251

Within 1 h, we observed 3·5 episodes with 25·6 min of cumulative contact time for nurses, 2·9 episodes and 22·1 min for doctors and 5·0 episodes with 44·3 min for assorted-HCWs. In interactions with patients, nurses had multiple brief episodes of contact; doctors had fewer episodes and less cumulative contact time; assorted-HCWs had fewer contact episodes of longer durations (than for nurses and doctors). Assortative mixing occurred amongst HCWs: those of the same HCW type were the next most frequent class of contact after patients. Over 24-h, patients contacted 14 persons with 23 episodes and 314·5 min of contact time. Patient-to-patient contact episodes were rare, but a maximum of five were documented from one patient participant. 22·9% of visitors reported contact with patients other than the one they visited.

We investigated the role of NEU1 in the myocardium after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Three days after inducing I/R, left ventricles (LV) of male mice (3 months-old) displayed upregulated neuraminidase activity and increased NEU1, β-GAL and PPCA expression. Mice hypomorphic for neu1 (hNEU1) had less neuraminidase activity, fewer pro-inflammatory (Lin-CD11b+F4/80+Ly-6Chigh), and more anti-inflammatory macrophages (Lin-CD11b+F4/80+Ly-6Clow) 3 days after I/R, and less LV dysfunction 14 days after I/R. WT mice transplanted with hNEU1-bone marrow (BM) and hNEU1 mice with WT-BM showed significantly better LV function 14 days after I/R compared with WT mice with WT-BM. Mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific NEU1 overexpression displayed no difference in inflammation 3 days after I/R, but showed increased cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, reduced expression and mislocalization of Connexin-43 in gap junctions, and LV dysfunction despite a similar infarct scar size to WT mice 14 days after I/R. The upregulation of NEU1 after I/R contributes to heart failure by promoting inflammation in invading monocytes/macrophages, enhancing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and impairing gap junction function, suggesting that systemic NEU1 inhibition may reduce heart failure after I/R.","Heimerl, Maren; Sieve, Irina; Ricke-Hoch, Melanie; Erschow, Sergej; Battmer, Karin; Scherr, Michaela; Hilfiker-Kleiner, Denise",Basic research in cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00395-020-00821-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975669/,251

CasRx is a small sized type VI-D effector (Cas13d) with RNA knockdown efficiency that may have an interference effect on RNA viruses. However, the RNA virus-targeting activity of CasRx still needs to be verified in vivo in vertebrates. In this study, we successfully engineered a highly effective CasRx system for fish virus interference. We designed synthetic mRNA coding for CasRx and used CRISPR RNAs to guide it to target the grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV). This technique resulted in significant interference with virus infections both in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that CRISPR/CasRx can be used to engineer interference against RNA viruses in fish, which provides a potential novel mechanism for RNA-guided immunity against other RNA viruses in vertebrates. Importance RNA viruses are most important viral pathogens infecting vertebrates and mammals. RNA virus populations are highly dynamic due to short generation times, large population sizes, and high mutation frequencies. Therefore, it is difficult to find a widely effective ways to inhibit RNA viruses. Therefore, we urgently need to develop effective antiviral methods. CasRx is a small sized type VI-D effector (Cas13d) with RNA knockdown efficiency that can have an interference effect on RNA viruses. Nervous necrosis virus (NNV), a non-enveloped positive-strand RNA virus, is one of the most serious viral pathogens infecting more than 40 cultured fish species resulting in huge economic losses worldwide. Here, we establish a novel efective CasRx system for RNA virus interference using NNV and grouper (Epinephelus coioices) as model.

However, the evidence is sparse regarding postoperative complications and among relevant patients subgroups. In a large cohort of patients including relevant patient subgroups, we evaluated intra- and postoperative complications using LSJ. METHODS Single-centre register-based study evaluating 3346 patients undergoing hemi- or total thyroidectomy. We compared differences in intra- and postoperative complications using LSJ compared to conventional technique. Multivariate analyses were conducted to adjust for potential confounders. RESULTS Compared to the conventional technique, LSJ was associated with less postoperative drainage (OR 0.4, p = 0.02) and postoperative haemorrhage (OR 0.3, p = 0.02) among patients undergoing hemi- and total thyroidectomy with benign histology, respectively, but with increased risk of postoperative infection [3 (6.4%) vs. 0 (0.0%) patients, p = 0.04] among patients undergoing total thyroidectomy with malignant histology. LSJ was associated with reduced operation duration (- 12.2 min, p < 0.001, - 7.9 min, p < 0.001 and - 13.2 min, p = 0.002) and intraoperative blood loss (- 52.1 ml, p < 0.001, - 13.6 ml, p < 0.001 and - 12.9 ml, p = 0.02) compared to conventional technique among patients undergoing total and hemithyroidectomy with benign histology and hemithyroidectomy with malignant histology, respectively. CONCLUSION LSJ was associated with a reduced risk of postoperative haemorrhage and less postoperative drainage but increased risk of postoperative infection depending on the type of thyroidectomy and histology of the thyroid gland. LSJ was associated with only a small reduction in operation duration and intraoperative blood loss.

So, we tried to develop a novel approach for triaging COVID-19 patients and deciding the priority for hospital admission using Lung Ultrasound. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of lung ultrasound in triaging suspected COVID-19 patients and assessment of the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and its comparison with CT chest as the gold standard. METHOD This was a multicenter cross-sectional study enrolled on 243 COVID-19 confirmed patients presented to the emergency department in three major University hospitals in Egypt. Lung ultrasound was done by an experienced emergency physician or chest physician according to the local protocol of each hospital. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected from each patient. Each patient was subjected to CT chest and lung ultrasound. RESULTS A total of 243 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this study, with a mean age of 46.7+10.4 years. Ground glass opacity (GGO), subpleural consolidation, trans-lobar consolidation, and crazy paving were reported in chest CT scans of 54.3%, 15.2%, 11.1%, and 8.6% of patients, respectively. B-line artifacts were found in 81.1% of COVID-19 patients, which was of confluent pattern in 18.9% of patients. The lung ultrasound findings of 197 patients (81.1%) were completely coincident with those of CT with a Kappa agreement value of 0.77, and this offered a diagnostic sensitivity of 74 %, a diagnostic specificity of 97.9 %, positive predictive value (PPV) of 90.2% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 93.6 % for lung ultrasound in triaging COVID-19 patients. Adding O2 saturation to the findings of lung imaging, the accuracy of evaluation of lung ultrasound to differentiate between severe and non-severe lung diseases showed that ultrasound had 100% sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION Lung Ultrasound with Oxygen saturation is a very efficient tool for decision-making to prioritize hospital admission for patients affected by COVID-19 in healthcare settings with limited resources.","Zaky, Samy; Metwally, Mohamed A; El Badry, Mohamed; Hasan, Ali A; Abd-Elsalam, Sherief; El-Raey, Fathiya; Eid, Alshaimaa; Alboraie, Mohamed; Elbahnasawy, Mohamed; Elrefai, Atef Wahdan; Elnaggar, Alya A; Moustafa, Ehab F; Abdelaziz, Ahmed; Baki, Amin Abdel; Elassal, Gehan; Abdelbary, Akram; Abdalmohsen, Ahmad Said; Kamal, Ehab; Asem, Noha; Ibrahim, Hamdy; Taema, Khaled; Amin, Wagdy; Kotb, Fatma M; Mohamed, Ahmed Sh; Abdelmageed, Neamat A; Elnady, Mohamed; Masoud, Hossam Hosny; Hassany, Mohamed; Zaid, Hala",Current medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.2174/1573405617666210506164243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33966621/,251
161841,NIDDK initiatives addressing health disparities in chronic diseases.,2020-07-21,"UNLABELLED All well-characterized positive-strand RNA viruses[(+)RNA viruses] induce the formation of host membrane-bound viral replication complexes (VRCs), yet the underlying mechanism and machinery for VRC formation remain elusive. We report here the biogenesis and topology of the Beet black scorch virus (BBSV) replication complex. Distinct cytopathological changes typical of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) aggregation and vesiculation were observed in BBSV-infected Nicotiana benthamiana cells. Immunogold labeling of the auxiliary replication protein p23 and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) revealed that the ER-derived membranous spherules provide the site for BBSV replication. Further studies indicated that p23 plays a crucial role in mediating the ER rearrangement. Three-dimensional electron tomographic analysis revealed the formation of multiple ER-originated vesicle packets. Each vesicle packet enclosed a few to hundreds of independent spherules that were invaginations of the ER membranes into the lumen. Strikingly, these vesicle packets were connected to each other via tubules, a rearrangement event that is rare among other virus-induced membrane reorganizations. Fibrillar contents within the spherules were also reconstructed by electron tomography, which showed diverse structures. Our results provide the first, to our knowledge, three-dimensional ultrastructural analysis of membrane-bound VRCs of a plant (+)RNA virus and should help to achieve a better mechanistic understanding of the organization and microenvironment of plant (+)RNA virus replication complexes. IMPORTANCE Assembly of virus replication complexes for all known positive-strand RNA viruses depends on the extensive remodeling of host intracellular membranes. Beet black scorch virus, a necrovirus in the family Tombusviridae, invaginates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes to form spherules in infected cells. Double-stranded RNAs, the viral replication intermediate, and the viral auxiliary replication protein p23 are all localized within such viral spherules, indicating that these are the sites for generating progeny viral RNAs. Furthermore, the BBSV p23 protein could to some extent reorganize the ER when transiently expressed in N. benthamiana. Electron tomographic analysis resolves the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of such spherules, which are connected to the cytoplasm via a neck-like structure. Strikingly, different numbers of spherules are enclosed in ER-originated vesicle packets that are connected to each other via tubule-like structures. Our results have significant implications for further understanding the mechanisms underlying the replication of positive-strand RNA viruses.","Cao, Xiuling; Jin, Xuejiao; Zhang, Xiaofeng; Li, Ying; Wang, Chunyan; Wang, Xianbing; Hong, Jian; Wang, Xiaofeng; Li, Dawei; Zhang, Yongliang",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00401-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25833056/,251

It is less clear how stones form when there is little or no plaque. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS Participants were a consecutive cohort of ICSFs who underwent percutaneous nephroscopic papillary mapping in the kidney or kidneys containing symptomatic stones and a papillary tip biopsy from a representative calyx during a stone removal procedure between 2009 and 2013. The distribution of Randall's plaque coverage was analyzed and used to divide ICSFs into those with a high (≥5%; mean, 10.5%; n=10) versus low (<5%; mean, 1.5%; n=32) amount of plaque coverage per papilla. Demographic and laboratory features were compared between these two groups. RESULTS Low-plaque stone formers tended to be obese (50% versus 10%; P=0.03) and have a history of urinary tract infection (34% versus 0%; P=0.04). They were less likely to have multiple prior stone events (22% versus 80%; P=0.002) and had a lower mean 24-hour urine calcium excretion (187±86 mg versus 291±99 mg; P<0.01). Morphologically, stones from patients with low amounts of plaque lacked a calcium phosphate core by microcomputed tomography. Papillary biopsies from low plaque stone-formers revealed less interstitial and basement membrane punctate crystallization. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that other pathways independent of Randall's plaque may contribute to stone pathogenesis among a subgroup of ICSFs who harbor low amounts of plaque.","Wang, Xiangling; Krambeck, Amy E; Williams, James C; Tang, Xiaojing; Rule, Andrew D; Zhao, Fang; Bergstralh, Eric; Haskic, Zejfa; Edeh, Samuel; Holmes, David R; Herrera Hernandez, Loren P; Lieske, John C",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.01490214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25092598/,251

Research carried out with or by patient partners is an increasingly accepted component of health service research in many countries, but how researchers can best approach engaging patient partners in the research process is still not clear. There is a need for guidance to support researchers when engaging patient partners and assess how such engagement impacts on research outputs. The aim of this paper is to present a protocol for a scoping review of published literature on how to engage patient partners effectively in the research process. Investigating this aim implies examining: a) how to engage patient partners in the research process; and b) what impact such engagement has on research outputs. This scoping review protocol is the first to examine how to engage patient partners effectively across different diseases and research areas. METHODS A scoping review using a systematic process informed by Arksey and O'Malley's framework will be carried out across six electronic databases using the terms 'patient participation', 'community participation', 'research personnel', 'patient and public involvement' and 'patient partner'. We will include published reviews concerning engagement of patient partners in the research process in healthcare settings, and exclude studies assessing engagement in treatment and healthcare. Two reviewers will screen the titles and abstracts of articles independently for inclusion, and extract data from articles that meet the inclusion criteria. Where there is disagreement, a third reviewer will be consulted to facilitate consensus. The data elicited will include: author and study characteristics; research aims and findings; description of patient engagement in the research process; and assessment impact. Descriptive data and narrative analysis will synthesize findings. DISCUSSION To understand how to engage patient partners effectively in the research process, the impact of such engagement must be taken into consideration to give a qualified suggestion for future guidance.

METHODS A total of 134 women admitted to Duzce University Hospital for primary or recurrent elective cesarean section were randomized into two groups. A total of 62 women were enrolled in the early group, with indwelling catheter removal 2 h after cesarean section; 74 women were enrolled in the delayed group, with catheter removal 12 h after the cesarean section. The groups were prospectively compared in terms of irritative urinary symptoms, bacteriuria, hematuria, length of hospital stay, and mobilization time. RESULTS Urinary frequency (p = .04), microscopic hematuria incidence (p = .04), postoperative mobilization time (p = .01), and length of hospital stay (p = .009) were significantly lower in the early group than in the delayed group. There were no significant differences in terms of bacteruria, urinary retention, dysuria, and first postoperative voiding time. CONCLUSIONS Early removal of urinary catheters after elective cesarean section is associated with reduced mobilization time and hospital stay.","Basbug, Alper; Yuksel, Alpaslan; Ellibeş Kaya, Aşkı","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2018.1487394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29886771/,251

Aminopeptidase N (APN) may be one of the IBV functional receptors. In this study, Gallus gallus APN (gAPN) protein was screened by phage-displayed 12-mer peptide library. Two high-affinity peptides H (HDYLYYTFTGNP) and T (TKFSPPSFWYLH) to gAPN protein were selected for in depth characterization of their anti-IBV effects. In vitro, indirect ELISA showed that these two high-affinity ligands could bind IBV S1 antibodies. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay, virus yield reduction assay and indirect immunofluorescence assay results revealed 3.125-50 μg/ml of peptide H and 6.25-50 μg/ml of peptide T reduced IBV proliferation in chicken embryo kidney cells (CEKs). In vivo, high-affinity phage-vaccinated chickens were able to induce specific IBV S1 antibodies and IBV neutralizing antibodies. QRT-PCR results confirmed that high-affinity phages reduced virus proliferation in chicken tracheas, lungs and kidneys, and alleviated IBV-induced lesions. By multiple sequence alignment, motif 'YxYY' and 'FxPPxxWxLH' of high-affinity peptides were identified in IBV S1-NTD, while another motif 'YxFxGN' located in S2. These results indicated that high affinity peptides of gAPN could present an alternative approach to IB prevention or treatment.","Sun, Xiaoqi; Li, Lanlan; Pan, Long; Wang, Zheng; Chen, Huijie; Shao, Changhao; Yu, Jia; Ren, Yudong; Wang, Xiurong; Huang, Xiaodan; Zhang, Ruili; Li, Guangxing",Antiviral research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104998; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33340637/,251

Static and lower-fidelity user-interface mock-ups can suffice during early phases of design or for user-paced environments, but higher-fidelity test beds are required to evaluate event-paced environments especially those exploring the supervisory control of automation. Increased fidelity is desirable as early as possible during the design process to explore the supervisory control design paradigm and generate more numerous and higher-quality user feedback. Complex AI-based systems are more difficult to test during early development phases. Static and low-fidelity prototypes typically cannot adequately represent the complex automation behaviors making usability more difficult to measure. A high fidelity user-interface prototyping approach was employed to simulate the capabilities of pending algorithms that are under development by multiple laboratories for a future intelligent air-defense system. The prototyping tool supported usability data collection by simulating the proposed automation and an initial supervisory control user-interface design within dynamic, group, air defense scenarios. This approach yielded high-quality user feedback early in the system design process even while being subjected to the constraints imposed by remote testing requirements due to COVID-19. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Guo, L.; Kellmeyer, D.; Osga, G.","AHFE International Conference on Human Factors and Simulation and the AHFE International Conference on Digital Human Modeling and Applied Optimization, 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-79763-8_4,251

However, spectatorship is not very popular in virtual reality, as such games strongly rely on one's feelings of presence. In other words, the head-mounted display creates a barrier between the player and the audience. We contribute an alternative watching approach consisting of two major components: a dynamic view frustum that renders the game scene from the current spectator position and a one-way mirror in front of the screen. This mirror, together with our silhouetting algorithm, allows seeing the player's reflection at the correct position in the virtual world. An exploratory survey emphasizes the overall positive experience of the viewers in our setup. In particular, the participants enjoyed their ability to explore the virtual surrounding via physical repositioning and to observe the blended player during object manipulations. Apart from requesting a larger screen, the participants expressed a strong need to interact with the player. Consequently, we suggest utilizing our technology as a foundation for novel playful experiences with the overarching goal to transform the passive spectator into a collocated player.","Krekhov, Andrey; Preuss, Daniel; Cmentowski, Sebastian; Kruger, Jens",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02582v1.pdf,251

To supplement and enrich the literature, this study aims to explore the relationships between tourists’ perceived risk, three dimensions of tourists’ emotional solidarity with hosts (feeling welcome, sympathetic understanding, and emotional closeness), and their customer loyalty towards the homestay industry in the post-pandemic era by taking the homestay industry of Guangzhou, China as the context, and employing SmartPLS for the empirical analysis. The results indicate that perceived risk has a significantly negative impact on emotional solidarity and customer loyalty, while emotional solidarity has a significantly positive impact on customer loyalty and plays a partial mediating role in the relationship between perceived risk and customer loyalty.

Because of the state of immunodepression, they are perceived as vulnerable and at high risk of contracting the virus. This may lead to a delay in the health care routine. Objectives: The aim of our study was to assess the routine of patients with rheumatic diseases in the era of covid-19. Methods: We conducted a prospective study after the outbreak of Covid-19 including patients with RD: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Spondylarthritis (SpA). All of them were invited to answer a questionnaire about adherence to protective measures, health services, hospital visits, treatment modalities, as well as the level of satisfaction with the medical support or information received for COVID-19. We also evaluated the post-traumatic state (PTS) with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). A cut-off point fixed at 33 provided the best diagnostic accuracy for PTS. The level of significance was fixed at 0.05. Results: The study included 60 patients with a female predominance (sex ratio=1.7). The mean age was 51.3 ± 13.1 years [18-75] and the mean disease duration was 11.9 ±5.6 [1-23] years. Forty-two patients had RA and 18 patients had SpA. The majority of respondents were women (63.3%), married (81.7%), with a household size of 3-5 people (67.9%). The mean DASS depression and anxiety subscale was 9.5 ±7.6 [2-32] and 12.6 ± 8.2 [1-35] respectively. PTS was found in 25% of cases. Twenty-two patients stopped working in the second outbreak. The adherence to protective measures was as follows: compliance with lock-down (92.5%), adherence to stay home warnings (82%), wearing masks (96.3%), social distancing (68%), and washing hands immediately after sneezing (59.3%). Information was mainly sourced from both social media and the Internet in 78.2% of cases. Most of the patients were satisfied with the information provided and only 5 demanded more information about vaccination protocol. Of the patients having direct contact with a person affected with Covid-19 (20%), seven patients experienced symptoms. Three patients were diagnosed with SARS-COV2 and three other patients were hospitalized because of flares. The majority of the respondents (98.2%) had confidence in their own doctors' ability to recognize Covid-19. The majority of patients (91%) were afraid of getting sick and 83.1% feared stigma and discrimination after the infection. Fifty patients did attend their consultation appointment and 13.3% had a phone consultation. About a third of patients (26.7%) of patients experienced a delay in treatment. A positive correlation was found between marital status and the fear of other family members getting Covid-19 (p=0.029). Patients who did not consult experienced more PTS and severe anxiety than those who did not delay hospital visits (p=0.07, p=0.04 respectively). Conclusion: Our study showed that during the outbreak of Covid-19, patients with RD exhibited a high level of protection towards the virus. Despite these precautionary measures, a delay in hospital routine was observed.","Mariem, S.; Yasmine, M.; Miladi, S.; Fazaa, A.; Souebni, L.; Ouenniche, K.; Kassab, S.; Chekili, S.; Ben Abdelghani, K.; Laatar, A.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.2125,251

The liquid crystal display transfer robot (LCDTR) has been widely used in LCD production lines to transport panels. Effective fault diagnosis and prognosis of the industrial robots are of great importance, since unplanned downtime caused by faulty robots significantly reduces the production capacity. Specifically, the ball screw is the critical component in the LCDTR. The failure of the ball screw can cause long downtime. Conventionally, the fault diagnosis of the ball screw is usually based on the vibration signals. However, it is extremely difficult to install the vibration sensors in the industrial robots. Therefore, in order to address this issue in condition monitoring, this paper proposes a data-driven fault diagnosis methodology using the motor current signals of the ball screw. Two time-frequency domain analysis methods are investigated, including short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet packet decomposition (WPD). The statistical features are extracted, and Fisher score is used to select features. Furthermore, the logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors are applied for the final fault diagnosis. Experiments on a real-world industrial robot dataset are carried out for validation. 100% diagnosis accuracy can be basically achieved by the proposed method, which indicates the non-stationary current signal can be effectively used to identify the health states of the ball screw in the LCDTR.","Yang, Qibo; Li, Xiang; Wang, Yinglu; Ainapure, Abhijeet; Lee, Jay",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920316036; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920316036,251

To help mitigate these challenges, we introduce a new robust and lightweight tool (ir_datasets) for acquiring, managing, and performing typical operations over datasets used in IR. We primarily focus on textual datasets used for ad-hoc search. This tool provides both a Python and command line interface to numerous IR datasets and benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the most extensive tool of its kind. Integrations with popular IR indexing and experimentation toolkits demonstrate the tool's utility. We also provide documentation of these datasets through the ir_datasets catalog: https://ir-datasets.com/.

The shift towards online services raised concerns related to safety and quality of services.ObjectivesThe objective of the study was to explore outcomes and perceptions regarding psychiatric telehealth services from the patients’ and professionals’ perspectives.MethodsSurvey and questionnaires were the main methods to collect feedback after 1129 sessions conducted by psychiatrists and psychotherapists for 559 young patients in 2020.ResultsOverall, patients/caregivers were generally satisfied with the quality of services, despite some technical issues and limitations of the platform. The most common outcomes of the sessions were: psychotherapy, in-depth assessment, pharmacotherapy, in-patient treatment, referrals for in-person appointments with other specialists, parenting strategies. Professionals gave more positive feedback on telehealth services after a few months of practice and training. Psychiatrists preferred conducting telehealth appointments for the patients they have previously seen in-person. The most common diagnosis were various neurodevelopmental disorders (48,9%), as well as patients within F84.0-F84.5 27,9%, and F84.8 (19,8%). Identification challenges, confidentiality and safety maintenance were among the top concerns for mental health workers. Specific guidelines for caregivers helped to use the appointment time effectively, prevent some technical and organizational issues and decrease negative effects of limited communication capabilities during a telehealth appointment.ConclusionsTelehealth services in psychiatry are meeting real needs of patients, caregivers and professionals, and require further development. Proper training for professionals and clear guidelines for caregivers are among the key factors that enhance the quality of services.","Shchedrinskaya, O.; Bebtschuk, M.; Khairetdinov, O.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.929,251
166437,Old Drugs for JAK-STAT Pathway Inhibition in COVID-19,2020-10-23,"A population of >6 million people worldwide at high risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are those with Down Syndrome (DS, caused by trisomy 21 (T21)), 70% of whom develop dementia during lifetime, caused by an extra copy of β-amyloid-(Aβ)-precursor-protein gene. We report AD-like pathology in cerebral organoids grown in vitro from non-invasively sampled strands of hair from 71% of DS donors. The pathology consisted of extracellular diffuse and fibrillar Aβ deposits, hyperphosphorylated/pathologically conformed Tau, and premature neuronal loss. Presence/absence of AD-like pathology was donor-specific (reproducible between individual organoids/iPSC lines/experiments). Pathology could be triggered in pathology-negative T21 organoids by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated elimination of the third copy of chromosome-21-gene BACE2, but prevented by combined chemical β and γ-secretase inhibition. We found that T21-organoids secrete increased proportions of Aβ-preventing (Aβ1-19) and Aβ-degradation products (Aβ1-20 and Aβ1-34). We show these profiles mirror in cerebrospinal fluid of people with DS. We demonstrate that this protective mechanism is mediated by BACE2-trisomy and cross-inhibited by clinically trialled BACE1-inhibitors. Combined, our data prove the physiological role of BACE2 as a dose-sensitive AD-suppressor gene, potentially explaining the dementia delay in ∼30% of people with DS. We also show that DS cerebral organoids could be explored as pre-morbid AD-risk population detector and a system for hypothesis-free drug screens as well as identification of natural suppressor genes for neurodegenerative diseases.","Alić, Ivan; Goh, Pollyanna A; Murray, Aoife; Portelius, Erik; Gkanatsiou, Eleni; Gough, Gillian; Mok, Kin Y; Koschut, David; Brunmeir, Reinhard; Yeap, Yee Jie; O’Brien, Niamh L; Groet, Jurgen; Shao, Xiaowei; Havlicek, Steven; Dunn, N Ray; Kvartsberg, Hlin; Brinkmalm, Gunnar; Hithersay, Rosalyn; Startin, Carla; Hamburg, Sarah; Phillips, Margaret; Pervushin, Konstantin; Turmaine, Mark; Wallon, David; Rovelet-Lecrux, Anne; Soininen, Hilkka; Volpi, Emanuela; Martin, Joanne E; Foo, Jia Nee; Becker, David L; Rostagno, Agueda; Ghiso, Jorge; Krsnik, Željka; Šimić, Goran; Kostović, Ivica; Mitrečić, Dinko; Francis, Paul T; Blennow, Kaj; Strydom, Andre; Hardy, John; Zetterberg, Henrik; Nižetić, Dean",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.29.918037,251

Few trials have investigated patients' perceived risks and benefits, and cancer care delivery (CCD) alterations related to COVID19. We sought to identify differences on behaviors and social determinants of health in Hispanics and other underrepresented populations (H/UP) compared to the general population (GP). Methods: An IRB-approved validated 27-item questionnaire was offered in English and Spanish to all pts. receiving cancer care at participating cancer centers over a 4 month period. Examined variables included demographic information, social risk and behavioral factors, preferred sources of health information, and overall satisfaction with CCD during the pandemic. Results: A total of 180 pts were enrolled in the study. Compared to GP, H/UP's perceived risk of COVID19 was higher with 93% vs 87% more likely to cancel or avoid social gatherings and 54% vs 46% more likely to change daily routine. H/UP appeared more concerned with personal and financial safety;if unable to find work/get paid for 2 weeks, 26% H/UP vs 10% GP would struggle to keep up with expenses. 40% H/UP vs 10% GP have concerns on perceived ability to secure food on short term and consider COVID19 a major threat to their health (70% vs 46%) and financial situation (63% vs 35%). H/UP's perceived benefits of protective measures is higher with 81% vs 60% routinely practicing social distancing (SD) and 79% vs 66% in agreement with punitive actions for not following SD. Analysis demonstrated no significant difference by age, gender, level of education, marital status, however Hispanic ethnicity and Spanish as primary language was a statistically significant variable (p = 0.025) in perceived risks and satisfaction with CCD. No major differences were noted on sources of health information although more H/UP relied on social media (33% vs 24%). H/UP appeared to be more skeptical about availability and safety of targeted vaccines (40% vs 15%). Satisfaction regarding CCD was comparable (84% vs 86%), although more H/UP perceived CCD alterations (15% vs 10%). Going forward, H/UP would prefer to incorporate virtual visits (VV) when possible (36% vs 25%). Conclusions: COVID19- related societal, financial, health and personal fears are increased in H/UP which likely negatively affects quality of life of these at-risk populations. H/UP's trust in SD recommendations is heightened although linguistically and culturally appropriate information may be deficient. H/UP's belief in vaccine availability and safety is comparable to GP, although recent reports suggest deeper fear and emphasize their fear of experimentation. Interventions aimed to decrease these differences could incorporate standard communications with special attention to social media. H/UP would prefer to incorporate VV into their care, although most do not possess appropriate technology to do so.","Hsu, E.; Chhabra, J.; Serrano, O.; Menendez, A.

To understand the regional emergence and transmission dynamics over time, we collected and sequenced the genomes of 117 extensively drug-resistant, NDM-producing K. pneumoniae isolates cultured over a 20-month period from 76 patients at several health care facilities in South-East Tuscany. All isolates belonged to high-risk clone ST-147 and were typically non-susceptible to all first line antibiotics. Albeit sporadic, resistances to colistin, tigecycline and fosfomycin were also observed as a result of repeated, independent mutations. Genomic analysis revealed that ST-147 isolates circulating in Tuscany were monophyletic, highly genetically related (including a network of 42 patients from the same hospital and sharing nearly identical isolates) and shared a recent ancestor with clinical isolates from the Middle East. While the blaNDM–1 gene was carried by an IncFIB-type plasmid, our investigations revealed that the ST-147 lineage from Italy also acquired a hybrid IncH-type plasmid carrying the 16S methyltransferase armA gene as well as key virulence biomarkers often found in hypervirulent isolates. This plasmid shared extensive homologies with mosaic plasmids circulating globally including from ST-11 and ST-307 convergent lineages. Phenotypically, the carriage of this hybrid plasmid resulted in increased siderophore production but did not confer virulence to the level of an archetypical, hypervirulent K. pneumoniae in a subcutaneous model of infection with immunocompetent CD1 mice. Our findings highlight the importance of performing genomic surveillance to identify emerging threats. Significance Statement Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae belong to the “critical priority” tier of bacterial pathogens as identified by the World Health Organization. Emerging “high-risk” lineages are responsible for difficult-to-treat, hospital-acquired infections and outbreaks around the globe. By integrating genomic and epidemiological data for isolates collected over 20 months, this study revealed both the high, regional prevalence and the rapid spread, within a single hospital, of K. pneumoniae ST-147 in Italy. Besides resistance to nearly all antibiotics, we showed that this lineage carried a hybrid plasmid harboring a set of biomarker genes previously linked to hypervirulence. Convergence of multidrug resistance and hypervirulence is a major concern and these findings highlight the need for robust, global surveillance to monitor the emergence of high-risk K. pneumoniae.","Martin, Melissa J.; Corey, Brendan W.; Sannio, Filomena; Hall, Lindsey R.; MacDonald, Ulrike; Jones, Brendan T.; Mills, Emma G.; Stam, Jason; Maybank, Rosslyn; Kwak, Yoon; Schaufler, Katharina; Becker, Karsten; Hübner, Nils-Olaf; Cresti, Stefania; Tordini, Giacinta; Valassina, Marcello; Cusi, Maria Grazia; Bennett, Jason W.; Russo, Thomas A.; McGann, Patrick T.; Lebreton, Francois; Docquier, Jean-Denis",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.02.446696,251

We examined 209,939 tweets before, and 203,490 tweets after the vaccine announcement. Pennebaker’s linguistic inquiry word count (LIWC) was used to detect tonal shifts via analytic thinking (which reflects logical thinking), clout (reflects expertise), authentic (reflects disclosure), and emotional tone (reflects emotional valence). Results indicated a decrease in authentic score implying a more guarded form of disclosure, while an increase in clout score suggests more sharing from expert users. The change was negligible for analytical thinking and emotional tone, suggesting users’ mentality towards the pandemic was not affected. Overall, results suggest a minimal shift in tone on Twitter, even in the face of the good news about the vaccine announcement. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Tan, H. W.; Lee, C.

169230,Immune status of COVID-19 patients with reference to SARS and MERS,2020,"Exposure to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during childhood is nearly ubiquitous by age two, and infants who develop severe RSV bronchiolitis are more likely to develop asthma later in life. In the Factors Influencing Pediatric Asthma (FIPA) study including 319 children from a Northern Plains American Indian community, we found 73% of children to have high concentrations of RSV-specific IgG (>40 IU/mL). High concentration of RSV-specific IgG was associated with increased exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke (p=7.5x10-4), larger household size (p=4.0x10-3), and lower levels of total serum IgE (p=5.1x10-3). Parents of children with asthma more often reported an RSV diagnosis and/or hospitalization due to RSV, and children with asthma had lower concentrations of RSV IgG as compared to those without asthma among RSV-exposed individuals (mean 117 IU/mL vs. 154, p=7.1x10-4). However, lower RSV IgG was surprisingly exclusive to children with asthma recruited during the winter months when RSV is thought to circulate more broadly. Multivariate regression indicated the strongest predictors of RSV-specific IgG concentration included asthma status (p=0.040), per cent eosinophils (p=0.035), and an asthma x RSV season interaction (p=3.7x10-3). Among candidate genes, we identified a genetic association between an intronic variant in IFNL4 and RSV-specific IgG concentration whereby the minor allele (A) was associated with higher concentration (rs12979860, p=4.3x10-3). Overall our findings suggest there are seasonal differences in immunological response to RSV infection in asthma cases vs. controls, and identify both environmental and genetic contributions that warrant further investigation.","Erdei, E.; Torgerson, D.; O'Leary, R.; Spear, M.; Shedden, M.; O'Leary, M.; Enright, K.; Best, L.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.17.21262198v1?rss=1,251
170626,The Light Beyond the Clouds,2021,"Importance: Tracking the direct and indirect impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on all-cause mortality in the United States has been hindered by the lack of testing and by reporting delays. Evaluating excess mortality, or the number of deaths above what is expected in a given time period, provides critical insights into the true burden of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Stratifying mortality data by demographics such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, and geography helps quantify how subgroups of the population have been differentially affected. Similarly, stratifying mortality data by cause of death reveals the public health effects of the pandemic in terms of other acute and chronic diseases. Objective: To provide stratified estimates of excess mortality in Colorado from March to September 2020. Design, Setting, and Population: This study evaluated the number of excess deaths both directly due to SARS-CoV-2 infection and from all other causes between March and September 2020 at the county level in Colorado. Data were obtained from the Vital Statistics Program at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. These estimates of excess mortality were derived by comparing population- adjusted mortality rates in 2020 with rates in the same months from 2015 to 2019. Results: We found evidence of excess mortality in Colorado between March and September 2020. Two peaks in excess deaths from all causes were recorded in the state, one mid-April and the other at the end of June. Since the first documented SARS-CoV-2 infection on March 5th, we estimated that the excess mortality rate in Colorado was two times higher than the officially reported COVID-19 mortality rate. State-level cumulative excess mortality from all causes reached 71 excess deaths per 100k residents (~4000 excess deaths in the state); in contrast, 35 deaths per 100k directly due to SARS-CoV-2 were recorded in the same period (~1980 deaths. Excess mortality occurred in 52 of 64 counties, accounting for 99% of the state's population. Most excess deaths recorded from March to September 2020 were associated with acute events (estimated at 44 excess deaths per 100k residents and at 9 after excluding deaths directly due to SARS-CoV-2) rather than with chronic conditions (~21 excess deaths per 100k). Among Coloradans aged 14-44, 1.4 times more deaths occurred in those months than during the same period in the five previous years. Hispanic White males died of COVID-19 at the highest rate during this time (~90 deaths from COVID-19 per 100k residents); however, Non-Hispanic Black/African American males were the most affected in terms of overall excess mortality (~204 excess deaths per 100k). Beyond inequalities in COVID-19 mortality per se, these findings signal considerable regional and racial-ethnic disparities in excess all-cause mortality that need to be addressed for a just recovery and in future public health crises.","Chandra, J.; Charpignon, M.; Samuel, M.

We build from findings of previous works that show that selected motion vectors are generally near the predictor to propose a solution that uses the motion vector bitrate to constrain the candidate search to a subset of the original search window, resulting in less distortion computations. The proposed method is not tied to a particular search pattern, which makes it applicable to several ME strategies. The technique was tested in the VVC reference software implementation and showed complexity reductions of over 80% at the cost of an average 0.74% increase in BD-Rate with respect to the original TZ Search algorithm in the LDP configuration.","Sant'Anna, Gabriel B.; Cancellier, Luiz Henrique; Seidel, Ismael; Grellert, Mateus; Guntzel, Jos'e Lu'is",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09656v2.pdf,251

Households with a SARS-CoV-2 confirmed positive case and at least one child in the Netherlands were followed for 6 weeks. Naso (NP)- and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, oral fluid and feces specimens were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serum for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The dynamics of the presence of viral RNA and the serological response was modeled to determine the sampling time-frame and sample type with the highest sensitivity to confirm or reject a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between adults and children within a household was correlated with symptom severity of index cases. In children higher viral loads compared to adults were detected at symptom onset. Early in infection, higher viral loads were detected in NP and OP specimens, while RNA in especially feces were longer detectable. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies have a 90% probability of detection from 7 days (total Ig) and 18 days (IgG) since symptom onset. In conclusion this study has shown that on average, children carry higher loads of virus as compared to adults early after infection. For highest probability of detection in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics early in infection, RT-PCR on NP and OP specimens are more sensitive than on oral fluid and feces. For SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics late after infection, RT-PCR on feces specimens and serology are more valuable.","Han, W. G. H.; Swart, A.; Bonacic Marinovic, A.; Eggink, D.; Reimerink, J.; Wijsman, L.

FIREBall observes a component of galaxies that plays a key role in how galaxies form and evolve, likely contains a significant amount of baryons, and has only recently been observed at higher redshifts in the visible. Here we report on the 2018 flight of the FIREBall-2 Balloon telescope, which occurred on September 22nd, 2018 from Fort Sumner, New Mexico. The flight was the culmination of a complete redesign of the spectrograph from the original FIREBall fiber-fed IFU to a wide-field multi-object spectrograph. The flight was terminated early due to a hole in the balloon, and our original science objectives were not achieved. The overall sensitivity of the instrument and telescope was 90,000 LU, due primarily to increased noise from stray light. We discuss the design of the FIREBall-2 spectrograph, modifications from the original FIREBall payload, and provide an overview of the performance of all systems. We were able to successfully flight test a new pointing control system, a UV-optimized, delta-doped and coated EMCCD, and an aspheric grating. The FIREBall-2 team is rebuilding the payload for another flight attempt in the Fall of 2021, delayed from 2020 due to COVID-19.","Hamden, Erika; Martin, D.

Throughout the lockdown, one of the largest sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV clinics in Beirut with linkages to major civil organizations in direct contact with sexual health beneficiaries has remained open for emergencies. The main objective of this study was to measure COVID19 impact on sexual health services in this clinic in Beirut. Methods A review of electronically based STIs screenings and diagnoses for the period February-December 2020 was conducted. Results The clinic has noted a major reduction in STI testing rates. Only 116 screenings were recorded in the mentioned period which contrasts with the 334 screenings conducted during the same period of 2019 (65% drop in 2020). All the screenings were among men who have sex with men (MSM). On the other hand, PEP was prescribed 86 times in the period February-December 2020 compared to 67 times during the same period of time in 2019 (28% increase). All cases of PEP prescriptions were for MSM. A range of risky behaviors and a 12% prevalence of HIV have been documented in MSM in Lebanon. Conclusion The increase in PEP prescription for MSM indicates that sexual risk-taking has persisted despite potential fear of contracting COVID-19. Two factors could explain our Results (1) social psychological stressors (political and economic instability, huge explosion, COVID19) may threaten identity and wellbeing, leading MSM to resort to sexual risk behaviours;(2) data on epidemiology of STIs in COVID19 time are inconsistent due to the lack of stratification by incubation period, acute versus chronic type, duration of symptoms and sexual orientation. Future studies should ascertain the impact of COVID19 on both mental and sexual health especially in stigmatized communities such as MSM.","Maatouk, I.; Assil, M.; Jaspal, R.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-sti.192,251
173198,Evaluation of the macro-and micro-economic factors affecting the financial energy of households,2021,"A vast portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) acting in the cytoplasm with largely unknown functions. Surprisingly, lncRNAs have been shown to interact with ribosomes, encode uncharacterized proteins, or act as ribosome sponges. These functions still remain mostly undetected and understudied owing to the lack of efficient tools for genome-wide simultaneous identification of ribosome-associated lncRNAs and peptide-producing lncRNAs. Here we present AHARIBO, a method for the detection of lncRNAs either untranslated, but associated with ribosomes, or encoding small peptides. Using AHARIBO in mouse embryonic stem cells during neuronal differentiation, we isolated ribosome-protected RNA fragments, translated RNAs and corresponding de novo synthesized polypeptides. Besides identifying mRNAs under active translation and associated ribosomes, we found and distinguished lncRNAs acting as ribosome sponges or encoding micropeptides, laying the ground for a better functional understanding of hundreds lncRNAs.","Minati, Luca; Firrito, Claudia; Piano, Alessia Del; Peretti, Alberto; Sidoli, Simone; Peroni, Daniele; Belli, Romina; Gandolfi, Francesco; Romanel, Alessandro; Bernabò, Paola; Zasso, Jacopo; Quattrone, Alessandro; Guella, Graziano; Lauria, Fabio; Viero, Gabriella; Clamer, Massimiliano",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.050062,251

Screening has an essential role in preventive medicine. Ideally, screening tools detect patients early enough to manage the disease and reduce symptoms. We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of routine screening schedules. Methods. We used a discrete-time nonstationary Markov model to simulate the progression of depression. We adopted annual transition probabilities, which were dependent on patient histories, such as the number of previous episodes, treatment status, and time spent without treatment state based on the available data. We used Monte Carlo techniques to simulate the stochastic model for 20 years or during the lifetime of individuals. Baseline and screening scenario models with screening frequencies of annual, 2-year, and 5-year were compared based on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Results. In the general population, all screening strategies were cost-effective compared to the baseline. However, male and female populations differed based on cost over quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Females had lower ICERs, and annual screening had the highest ICER for females, with 11,134 $/QALY gained. In contrast, males had around three times higher ICER, with annual screening costs of 34,065$/QALY gained. Conclusions. Considering the high lifetime prevalence and recurrence rates of depression, detection and prevention efforts can be one critical cornerstone to support required care. Our analysis combined the expected benefits and costs of screening and assessed the effectiveness of screening scenarios. We conclude that routine screening is cost-effective for all age groups of females and young, middle-aged males. Male population results are sensitive to the higher costs of screening.","Yildirim, M.; Gaynes, B.; Keskinocak, P.; Pence, B.; Swann, J.

174680,Digital clinical trial: A new norm in clinical research,2021,"Although huge volumes of valuable data can be generated and collected at a rapid velocity from a wide variety of rich data sources, their availability may vary due to various factors. For example, in the competitive business world, huge volumes of transactional shopper market data may not be made available partially due to proprietary concerns. As another example, in the healthcare domain, huge volumes of medical data may not be made available partially due to privacy concerns. Sometimes, only limited volumes of privacy-preserving data are made available for research and/or other purposes. Embedded in these data is implicit, previously unknown and useful information and knowledge. Analyzing these data by data science models can be for social and economic good. For instance, health analytics of medical data and disease reports can lead to the discovery of useful information and knowledge about diseases such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This knowledge helps users to get a better understanding of the disease, and thus to take parts in preventing, controlling and/or combating the disease. However, many existing data science models often require lots of historical data for training. To deal with the challenges of limited data, we present in this paper a data science system for health analytics on COVID-19 data. With few-shot learning, our system requires only limited data for training. Evaluation on real-life COVID-19 data—specifically, routine blood test results from potential Brazilian COVID-19 patients—demonstrates the effectiveness of our system in predicting and classifying of COVID-19 cases based on a small subset of features in limited volumes of COVID-19 data for health analytics. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Leung, C.

We examined the copy number and variant types of all SARS-CoV-2-positive patients who visited our hospital from February to August 2021 using PCR tests. Whole genome sequencing was performed for some samples. The R.1 variant (B.1.1.316) was responsible for most infections in March, replacing the previous variant (B.1.1.214); the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant caused most infections in April and May; and the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was the most prevalent in July and August. There was no significant difference in copy numbers among the previous variant cases (n=29, median 3.0x104 copies/L), R.1 variant cases (n=28, 2.1x105 copies/L), Alpha variant cases (n=125, 4.1x105 copies/L), and Delta variant cases (n=106, 2.4x105 copies/L). Patients with Delta variant infection were significantly younger than those infected with R.1 and the previous variants, possibly because many elderly individuals in Tokyo were vaccinated between May and August. There was no significant difference in mortality among the four groups. Our results suggest that the increased infectivity of Delta variant may be caused by factors other than the higher viral loads. Clarifying these factors is important to control the spread of Delta variant infection.","Tani-Sassa, C.; Iwasaki, Y.; Ichimura, N.; Nagano, K.; Takatsuki, Y.; Yuasa, S.; Takahashi, Y.; Nakajima, J.; Sonobe, K.; Nukui, Y.; Takeuchi, H.; Tanimoto, K.; Tanaka, Y.; Kimura, A.; Tohda, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.21.21263879v1?rss=1,251

This study aims to examine whether the COVID-19 pandemic is a blessing or a curse for women entrepreneurs in Pakistan’s informal sector. The influence of business type, family support and other socio-economic factors on the sales volume of women’s businesses is examined. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 400 women entrepreneurs using a survey questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to investigate the relationships between perceived sales volume and socio-economic as well as demographic factors of women entrepreneurs. Findings: Findings for RQ1 revealed that the pandemic was a blessing for cloth and cosmetic entrepreneurs, but a curse for those women selling dairy products. Results for RQ2 showed that age, homeownership, household size, family support and type of business were significant predictors of sales. Furthermore, women entrepreneurs were greatly influenced by their family’s desires and decisions, such that women entrepreneurs who received support from families and relatives reported higher sales than those who did not receive such support. Practical implications: The results may assist policymakers in designing supportive programs to encourage women’s informal entrepreneurial activities. Creating entrepreneurial ecosystems may provide support for women entrepreneurs beyond family support. The findings provide a better understanding of women’s business effectiveness during COVID-19 pandemic. It reveals the resilience of women entrepreneurs in the face of cultural, economic and institutional constraints encountered during the pandemic. Originality/value: This study is unique because it focuses on the impact of the pandemic at the household level rather than examining broad macroeconomic scenarios.

By automating extraction in conjunction with standardized terminology, the quality and consistency of data utilized for research and clinical purposes would be substantially improved. Here, we set out to develop and validate a framework to extract pertinent clinical conditions for traumatic brain injury (TBI) from computed tomography (CT) reports. Materials and Methods We developed tbiExtractor, which extends pyConTextNLP, a regular expression algorithm using negation detection and contextual features, to create a framework for extracting TBI common data elements from radiology reports. The algorithm inputs radiology reports and outputs a structured summary containing 27 clinical findings with their respective annotations. Development and validation of the algorithm was completed using two physician annotators as the gold standard. Results tbiExtractor displayed high sensitivity (0.92-0.94) and specificity (0.99) when compared to the gold standard. The algorithm also demonstrated a high equivalence (94.6%) with the annotators. A majority of clinical findings (85%) had minimal errors (F1 Score ≥ 0.80). When compared to annotators, tbiExtractor extracted information in significantly less time (0.3 sec vs 1.7 min per report). Discussion and Conclusion tbiExtractor is a validated algorithm for extraction of TBI common data elements from radiology reports. This automation reduces the time spent to extract structured data and improves the consistency of data extracted. Lastly, tbiExtractor can be used to stratify subjects into groups based on visible damage by partitioning the annotations of the pertinent clinical conditions on a radiology report.","Mahan, Margaret; Rafter, Daniel; Casey, Hannah; Engelking, Marta; Abdallah, Tessneem; Truwit, Charles; Oswood, Mark; Samadani, Uzma",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/585331,251

Using an agent-based model (ABM) that accounts for the complex interplay of demographic factors, risk behaviors, social networks, and geographic location for HCV transmission among PWID, we examined the combination(s) of DAA enrollment (2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 10%), adherence (60%, 70%, 80%, 90%) and frequency of DAA treatment courses needed to achieve the WHO’s goal of reducing incident chronic infections by 90% by 2030 among a large population of PWID from Chicago, IL and surrounding suburbs. We also estimated the economic DAA costs associated with each scenario. Our results indicate that a DAA treatment rate of >7.5% per year with 90% adherence results in 75% of enrolled PWID requiring only a single DAA course; however19% would require 2 courses, 5%, 3 courses and <2%, 4 courses), with an overall DAA cost of $325 million to achieve the WHO goal in metropolitan Chicago. We estimate a 28% increase in the overall DAA cost under low adherence (70%) compared to high adherence (90%). Our modeling results have important public health implications for HCV elimination among U.S. PWID. Using a range of feasible treatment enrollment and adherence rates, we report robust findings supporting the need to address re-exposure and reinfection among PWID to reduce HCV incidence.","Tatara, Eric; Gutfraind, Alexander; Collier, Nicholson T.; Echevarria, Desarae; Cotler, Scott J.; Major, Marian; Ozik, Jonathan; Dahari, Harel; Boodram, Basmattee",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/653196,251

Aiming at teacher educators, we review problems with the notion of interculturality in light of the crisis. We argue that these problems were not created by the crisis, but that the crisis unveiled them. In the first part of the article we suggest that these issues should be approached by looking into interculturality (and companion terms such as “democracy” and “equality”) as an ideology that deserves deconstructing, unthinking, reconstructing and rethinking. We also describe the problems triggered by this ideology: the need to shift from “dead imagination” (culture, difference, etc.) to unearthing the “groundwater” of the economy and globalization in the way interculturality functions. We then propose a set of three principles that could be used by teacher educators to train future teachers to deal with interculturality afresh: “Beyond comparison”, “The mirror: turning inward”, and “Questioning the unquestionables”.","Dervin, Fred Chen Ning Yuan Mei Jacobsson Andreas",Education and Society,https://doi.org/10.7459/es/38.1.06,251

Design/methodology/approach: Twenty students were recruited as cadres and trained for thalassemia every weekend for four weeks, followed by creating health promotions via online media. The media was further disseminated among the students’ peer groups for a week. The respondent’s knowledge was measured before and after health promotion utilizing an online media mixed-methods approach that combined quantitative data using an online questionnaire and in-depth interviews for qualitative measurement. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed using Graph Prism 5.00. Interview transcripts were analyzed to elaborate on the respondent’s understanding of thalassemia. Findings: The respondents had good basic knowledge about thalassemia;however, it was not in-line with their understanding, which increased after the online health promotion activity. Therefore, this approach is useful for disseminating health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic and can be implemented for broadening respondents. Originality/value: This study showed the experience of online peer-group activism for thalassemia prevention in high school students. By empowering the peer group, health promotion is effective in increasing the knowledge and understanding of thalassemia.

Advancing tools to integrate multi-omic data, we develop FigR - a framework to computationally pair scATAC-seq with scRNA-seq cells, connect distal cis-regulatory elements to genes, and infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to identify candidate TF regulators. Utilizing these paired multi-omic data, we define Domains of Regulatory Chromatin (DORCs) of immune stimulation and find that cells alter chromatin accessibility prior to production of gene expression at time scales of minutes. Further, the construction of the stimulation GRN elucidates TF activity at disease-associated DORCs. Overall, FigR enables the elucidation of regulatory interactions across single-cell data, providing new opportunities to understand the function of cells within tissues.","Kartha, Vinay K.; Duarte, Fabiana M.; Hu, Yan; Ma, Sai; Chew, Jennifer G.; Lareau, Caleb A.; Earl, Andrew; Burkett, Zach D.; Kohlway, Andrew S.; Lebofsky, Ronald; Buenrostro, Jason D.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.28.453784,251

Information about disease and drug history was extracted from their medical records. Dried blood spots were eluted and tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV2 receptor binding domain. Seropositivity was expressed according to validated cut-off indices. Antibody titers were partitioned into tertiles using data from people on no disease modifying therapy as a reference. We calculated the odds ratio of seroconversion (Univariate logistic regression) and compared quantitative vaccine response (Kruskal Wallis) following SARS-CoV2 vaccine according to disease modifying therapy. We used regression modelling to explore the effect of factors including vaccine timing, treatment duration, age, vaccine type and lymphocyte count on vaccine response. Results: Compared to no disease modifying therapy, the use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (odds ratio 0.03; 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.06, p<0.001) and fingolimod (odds ratio 0.41; 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.12) were associated with lower seroconversion following SARS-CoV2 vaccine. All other drug groups did not differ significantly from the untreated cohort. Both time since last anti-CD20 treatment and total time on treatment were significantly related with serological response to vaccination. Vaccine type significantly predicted seroconversion, but not in those on anti-CD20 medications. Interpretation: Some disease modifying therapies carry a risk of attenuated response to SARS-CoV2 vaccination in people with MS. We provide recommendations for the practical management of this patient group.","Tallantyre, E. C.; Vickaryous, N.; Anderson, V.; Asardag, A. N.; Baker, D.; Bestwick, J.

The aim of this study was to establish and evaluate the feasibility of a long-term survival RYGBP model in super obese Göttingen minipigs in order to improve the translational potential relative to current animal models. METHODS Eleven Göttingen minipigs with diet-induced obesity underwent laparoscopic RYGBP and were followed up to 9 months after surgery. Intra- and post-operative complications, body weight (BW), food intake and necropsy data were recorded. RESULTS Five minipigs survived without complications to the end of the study. Four minipigs developed surgical related complications and were euthanized while two minipigs died due to central venous catheter related complications. BW and food intake is reported for the six minipigs surviving longer than 4.5 months post-surgery. Weight loss and reduced food intake was seen in all minipigs. After 2-3 months of weight loss, weight regain was evident in all but two minipigs which seemed to continue losing weight. Necropsy revealed some variation in the length of the alimentary, biliary and common limb between minipigs. CONCLUSION The use of obese Göttingen minipigs as a translational RYGBP model is feasible and has potential for the study of RYGBP-related changes in gut function, type-2 diabetes and appetite regulation. Still, the surgical procedure is technically highly demanding in obese Göttingen minipigs and the peri-operative animal care and follow up requires close monitoring.","Birck, Malene M; Vegge, Andreas; Støckel, Mikael; Gögenur, Ismail; Thymann, Thomas; Hammelev, Karsten P; Sangild, Per T; Hansen, Axel K; Raun, Kirsten; von Voss, Pia; Eriksen, Thomas",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24093061/,251

187253,COVID-19 Poses Challenges to Immigrant Physicians in the United States.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND ST-246 is a potent anti-orthopoxviral molecule targeting the F13L protein of vaccinia virus, which is involved in the wrapping of viruses. The discrepancy in sensitivities of several orthopoxviruses to ST-246 has raised questions about potential differences in their replicative cycles and/or the presence of another drug target. METHODS Density gradients were used to evaluate the differences between the viral cycles of vaccinia, cowpox and camelpox viruses. Also, to investigate if ST-246 inhibits a single target, we compared its activity to that of small interfering RNAs designed to silence the F13L gene (siF13Ls). RESULTS We showed that the spread of vaccinia virus involved both intracellular and extracellular enveloped viruses, whereas both cowpox and camelpox viruses seemed to propagate via non-enveloped intracellular forms and cell-associated viral particles. Although ST-246 exerted a clear antiviral activity by interfering with the egress of the virus from infected cells, we observed that cowpox and camelpox viruses, in contrast to vaccinia virus, could be directed towards a lytic cycle under ST-246 treatment. We specifically knocked down the F13L transcripts of vaccinia and camelpox viruses by > 85%, reduced virus progeny by 90% and showed that siF13Ls affect camelpox and vaccinia virus propagation differently. Flow cytometry data validated that ST-246 interfered with the activity of the F13L protein, whereas siF13Ls silenced the F13L gene. CONCLUSIONS Our observations support that vaccinia, cowpox and camelpox viruses exhibit different levels of sensitivity to ST-246 because of dissimilarities between their ways of propagation, and provide a better understanding of the mode of action of ST-246.","Duraffour, Sophie; Vigne, Solenne; Vermeire, Kurt; Garcel, Aude; Vanstreels, Els; Daelemans, Dirk; Yang, Guang; Jordan, Robert; Hruby, Dennis E; Crance, Jean-Marc; Garin, Daniel; Andrei, Graciela; Snoeck, Robert",Antiviral therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19195323/,251

OBJECTIVES This research was primarily intended to determine the potential diminishing effects of moderate hypothermia on anesthetic dosage and recall of anesthesia during the procedure. METHODS In this double-blind randomized controlled trial, a total of 80 CABG candidates with known addiction to opium were divided into two groups: one normothermic (N) and the other moderately hypothermic (H), both undergoing induction as well as close monitoring from September 2014 to January 2016. The candidates were initially set for a target bispectral index (BIS) score of between 40 and 60. As the score rose to 60, an additional dose of propofol was administered, alongside rise in blood pressure and tear-shedding. To enhance the accuracy of our evaluation of anesthetic depth, we also used two questionnaires to test candidates' recall filled with the assistance of a colleague 24 hours following surgery. Independent-samples t-test and chi-square test were used by SPSS v 18 for data analysis. RESULTS Eighty patients were studied in two groups of normothermic (N) (n = 40) and hypothermic (H) (n = 40). Given similar demographic data as well as the duration of surgery, we arrived at a propofol dose of 122.52±13.11 cc for normothermic patients and 101.28±14.06 cc for hypothermic subjects (p=0.001). As for fentanyl, the total required sum came up to 39.60±21.04 cc and 31.72±5.81 cc for the above-mentioned groups in order (p=0.025). Moreover, the post-operative interview showed that there was no report of a patient with memory recall following surgery.

However, the relative contributions of type I IFN (IFN-I) to direct, cell-type-specific virus control or CD8 T-cell-mediated effectors in the CNS are unclear. IFN-I receptor-deficient (IFNAR(-/-)) mice infected with a sublethal and demyelinating neurotropic virus variant and those infected with a nonpathogenic neurotropic virus variant both succumbed to infection within 9 days. Compared to wild-type (wt) mice, replication was prominently increased in all glial cell types and spread to neurons, demonstrating expanded cell tropism. Furthermore, increased pathogenesis was associated with significantly enhanced accumulation of neutrophils, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, and IFN-gamma within the CNS. The absence of IFN-I signaling did not impair induction or recruitment of virus-specific CD8 T cells, the primary adaptive mediators of virus clearance in wt mice. Despite similar IFN-gamma-mediated major histocompatibility complex class II upregulation on microglia in infected IFNAR(-/-) mice, class I expression was reduced compared to that on microglia in wt mice, suggesting a synergistic role of IFN-I and IFN-gamma in optimizing class I antigen presentation. These data demonstrate a critical direct antiviral role of IFN-I in controlling virus dissemination within the CNS, even in the presence of potent cellular immune responses. By limiting early viral replication and tropism, IFN-I controls the balance of viral replication and immune control in favor of CD8 T-cell-mediated protective functions.","Ireland, Derek D C; Stohlman, Stephen A; Hinton, David R; Atkinson, Roscoe; Bergmann, Cornelia C",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17928334/,251
193475,Decreasing Resource Utilization Using Standardized Clinical Assessment and Management Plans (SCAMPs).,2016,"BACKGROUND A virally-induced cytokine storm syndrome, associated with a massive and overwhelming systemic inflammation, burdens a subgroup of patients with severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), which leads to pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage. These severe COVID-19 patients are characterized by high ferritin levels. These findings mirror what was previously reported about the prognostic role of this iron storage protein in other inflammatory diseases included in the hyperferritinemic syndrome. The latter suggests that ferritin could be a further pathogenic mediator in enhancing the inflammatory process, stimulating inflammatory pathways, and thus perpetuating a vicious pathogenic loop. Considering its activity as an immune activator, a therapeutic approach targeting ferritin may be also postulated in these diseases. Considering these observations, high ferritin levels characterize severe COVID-19 and other diseases included in the hyperferritinemic syndrome. Because ferritin could enhance the inflammatory process, it could be tested as a possible new therapeutic target to improve the outcome of these patients.","Ruscitti, Piero; Giacomelli, Roberto",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33236586/,251

In this paper we present results from surveys relating to opening the New Zealand border. METHOD Three surveys were distributed to primary care practices between May and December 2020. A range of primary care member organisations distributed the survey augmented by snowballing. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative data through an inductive process and grouped into themes. RESULTS Respondents became increasingly supportive of opening a trans-Tasman border but not internationally. Two broad themes were evident: (1) making sure that the border is not an Achilles heel and (2) effective strategies to reduce local transmission. These themes highlight primary care's concerns around management of the border and the management of local spread respectively. CONCLUSION The results highlight concerns around border control from a primary care perspective. The border control issues raised by primary care have proven to be prophetic at times and reflect the role that primary care has as observers of society. The survey mechanism provides a template for rapidly eliciting a primary care voice for future health issues.,"Eggleton, Kyle; Bui, Nam; Goodyear-Smith, Felicity",The New Zealand medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34239146/,251
194487,[Comment to the article «Frecuency of diagnosis of bone lesions in cases of anterior glenohumeral dislocation»].,2019,"The major objective of this study was to investigate the pathogenic role of human bocavirus (hBoV) in patients hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI). Overall, 685 respiratory samples from 426 patients were examined by PCR for human bocavirus, as well as for other known human respiratory viruses. HBoV was quantified by PCR. Forty/283 (14.1%) pediatric patients, and 2/143 (1.4%) adult patients were found to harbor hBoV for a total of 45 episodes (16 detected as single infection, and 29 as coinfection) of hBoV-associated respiratory infection. HBoV DNA quantification revealed the presence of an NPA viral load > 1.0 x 10(5) DNA copies/ml in respiratory secretions from 17/40 (42.5%) children and 0/2 adults. Below this cut-off, hBoV appeared to be an innocent bystander or a persistent virus. Although hBoV may be frequently detected in children with upper or lower ARTI, in less than 50% young patients it appears to be potentially pathogenic.","Gerna, Giuseppe; Piralla, Antonio; Campanini, Giulia; Marchi, Antonietta; Stronati, Mauro; Rovida, Francesca",The new microbiologica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18080673/,251
195292,Comparison of Attitudes of Wisconsin Health Care Providers and Pharmacists Toward Vaccine Administration and Perceived Barriers.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is one of the major surgical techniques for small renal masses. However, it is difficult to manage cutting and suturing procedures within acceptable time periods. To overcome this difficulty, we applied a three-dimensional (3D) video system with laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, and evaluated its utility. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively enrolled 31 patients who underwent laparoscopic partial nephrectomy between November 2009 and June 2014. A conventional two-dimensional (2D) video system was used in 20 patients, and a 3D video system in 11. Patient characteristics and video system type (2D or 3D) were recorded, and correlations with perioperative outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Mean age of the patients was 55.8±12.4, mean body mass index was 25.7±3.9 kg/m2, mean tumor size was 2.0±0.8 cm, mean R.E.N.A.L nephrometry score was 6.9±1.9, and clinical stage was T1a in all patients. There were no significant differences in operative time (p=0.348), pneumoperitoneum time (p=0.322), cutting time (p=0.493), estimated blood loss (p=0.335), and Clavien grade of >II complication rate (p=0.719) between the two groups. However, warm ischemic time was significantly shorter in the 3D group than the 2D group (16.1 min vs. 21.2min, p=0.021), which resulted from short suturing time (9.1 min vs. 15.2 min, p=0.008). No open conversion occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS A 3D video system allows the shortening of warm ischemic time in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and thus may be useful in improving the procedure.","Komatsuda, Akari; Matsumoto, Kazuhiro; Miyajima, Akira; Kaneko, Gou; Mizuno, Ryuichi; Kikuchi, Eiji; Oya, Mototsugu",Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27268616/,251
195686,Changes in main causes of death in Macao residents from 1986 - 2006.,2013,"The nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a multidomain protein and has been shown to undergo remarkable genetic variation, primarily in its middle region, while exhibiting high conservation in the N-terminal putative protease domain and the C-terminal predicted transmembrane region. A reverse genetics system of PRRSV North American prototype VR-2332 was developed to explore the importance of different regions of nsp2 for viral replication. A series of mutants with in-frame deletions in the nsp2 coding region were engineered, and infectious viruses were subsequently recovered from transfected cells and further characterized. The results demonstrated that the cysteine protease domain (PL2), the PL2 downstream flanking sequence (amino acids [aa] 181 to 323), and the putative transmembrane domain were critical for replication. In contrast, the segment of nsp2 preceding the PL2 domain (aa 13 to 35) was dispensable for viral replication, and the nsp2 middle hypervariable region (aa 324 to 813) tolerated 100-aa or 200-aa deletions but could not be removed as a whole; the largest deletion was about 400 aa (nsp2Delta324-726). Characterization of the mutants demonstrated that those with small deletions possessed growth kinetics and RNA expression profiles similar to those of the parental virus, while the nsp2Delta324-726 mutant displayed decreased cytolytic activity on MARC-145 cells and did not develop visible plaques. Finally, the utilization of the genetic flexibility of nsp2 to express foreign genes was examined by inserting the gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) in frame into one nsp2 deletion mutant construct. The recombinant virus was viable but impaired and unstable and gradually gained parental growth kinetics by the loss of most of the GFP gene.","Han, Jun; Liu, Gongping; Wang, Yue; Faaberg, Kay S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17522233/,251

The calves were selected from 22 herds in which all calves were free of clinically apparent enteric disease. Salmonella sp, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium, and coronavirus were not detected in any of the calves. Three calves were infected with rotavirus and 1 calf was infected with Yersinia enterocolitica. Campylobacter-like bacteria were isolated from 50 of 130 calves, with 36 of the calves positive for C jejuni. Seemingly, clinically normal calves may be infected more often with enterotoxigenic E coli, Cryptosporidium, coronavirus, or rotavirus in herds in which some calves have enteric disease than in herds free of major enteric disease. Campylobacter jejuni was well adapted to the bovine host and was of similar prevalence in diarrheal and nondiarrheal calves. The K99 positive, nonenterotoxigenic E coli was isolated from the feces of 16 healthy calves.

196824,In this issue,2000,"BACKGROUND Revisional surgery is an important component of addressing weight regain and complications following primary bariatric surgery. Owing to provincial need and the complexity of this patient population, a specialized multidisciplinary revision clinic was developed. We sought to characterize patients who undergo revision surgery and compare their outcomes with primary bariatric surgery clinic data. METHODS We completed a retrospective chart review of bariatric revision clinic patients compared with primary bariatric surgery patients from December 2009 to June 2014. RESULTS We reviewed the charts of 2769 primary bariatric clinic patients, 886 of whom had bariatric surgery, and 534 revision bariatric clinic patients, 83 of whom had revision surgery. Fewer revision clinic patients underwent surgery than primary clinic patients (22% v. 32%). The mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 44.7 ± 9.5 in revision patients compared with 45.7 ± 7.6 in primary bariatric surgery patients. Most revision patients had a prior vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG; 48%) or a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB; 24%). Bands were removed in 36% of all LAGB patients presenting to clinic. Of the 134 procedures performed in the revision clinic, 83 were bariatric weight loss surgeries, and 51 were band removals. Revision clinic patients experienced a significant decrease in BMI (from 44.7 ± 9.5 to 33.8 ± 7.5, p < 0.001); their BMI at 12-month follow-up was similar to that of primary clinic patients (34.5 ± 7.0, p = 0.7). Complications were significantly more frequent in revision patients than primary patients (41% v. 15%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION A bariatric revision clinic manages a wide variety of complex patients distinct from those seen in a primary clinic. Operative candidates at the revision clinic are chosen based on favourable medical, anatomic and psychosocial factors, keeping in mind the resource constraints of a public health care system.","Fulton, Courtney; Sheppard, Caroline; Birch, Daniel; Karmali, Shazeer; de Gara, Christopher",Canadian journal of surgery.

METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with AIS arriving within 2 hours of onset to hospitals participating in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke without documented contraindications to IV tPA from April 2003 through December 2011, comparing those who received tPA to those who did not. Multivariable generalized estimating equation logistic regression modeling identified factors associated with not receiving tPA. RESULTS Of 61,698 eligible patients with AIS presenting within 2 hours of onset (median age 73 years, 51% female, 74% non-Hispanic white, median NIH Stroke Scale score 11, interquartile range 6-18), 15,282 (25%) were not treated with tPA within 3 hours. Failure to give tPA decreased over time from 55% in 2003 to 2005 to 18% in 2010 to 2011 (p < 0.0001). After adjustment for all covariates, including stroke severity, factors associated with failure to treat included older age, female sex, nonwhite race, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke, atrial fibrillation, prosthetic heart valve, NIH Stroke Scale score <5, arrival off-hours and not via emergency medical services, longer onset-to-arrival and door-to-CT times, earlier calendar year, and arrival at rural, nonteaching, non-stroke center hospitals located in the South or Midwest. CONCLUSIONS Overall, about one-quarter of eligible patients with AIS presenting within 2 hours of stroke onset failed to receive tPA treatment. Thrombolysis has improved dramatically over time and is strongly associated with stroke center certification. Additionally, some groups, including older patients, milder strokes, women, and minorities, may be undertreated.","Messé, Steven R; Khatri, Pooja; Reeves, Mathew J; Smith, Eric E; Saver, Jeffrey L; Bhatt, Deepak L; Grau-Sepulveda, Maria V; Cox, Margueritte; Peterson, Eric D; Fonarow, Gregg C; Schwamm, Lee H",Neurology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27629092/,251
196948,Impact of an antimicrobial dressing in reducing surgical site infections in cardiac surgery patients.,2013,"Mental health is a state of mental well-being in which people are able to cope with stressful situations in life and can bring their life potential to their communities. Good mental health enables people to fulfill their roles in both family and society. When crises affect social life, people should be expected to experience high levels of stress. The COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the physical health crisis, may also contribute to the exacerbation of stress and the emergence of mental illnesses. Many individuals suffer due to forced isolation or feel socially excluded. Also, many of them fear infection, death and losing family members. Moreover, specific population groups show varying degrees of COVID-19-related psychological stress. The paper presents the psychological problems of the consequences of COVID-19 in society based on a review of the latest articles available in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The discussed material points to different needs in terms of psychological support in the society. People in unstable living conditions are at a greater risk of losing their mental health. Moreover, their mental health needs may be completely overlooked. Emotional difficulties may worsen among children and adolescents as a result of both family stress and social isolation. It is essential to include mental health protection in health policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to accelerate the recovery of communities.","Ogłodek, Ewa A",Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34218247/,251

197318,Alexia without agraphia associated with spleniogeniculate infarction.,1991,"SARS 3C-like proteinase has been proposed to be a key enzyme for drug design against SARS. Lack of a suitable assay has been a major hindrance for enzyme kinetic studies and a large-scale inhibitor screen for SARS 3CL proteinase. Since SARS 3CL proteinase belongs to the cysteine protease family (family C3 in clan CB) with a chymotrypsin fold, it is important to understand the catalytic mechanism of SARS 3CL proteinase to determine whether the proteolysis proceeds through a general base catalysis mechanism like chymotrypsin or an ion pair mechanism like papain. We have established a continuous colorimetric assay for SARS 3CL proteinase and applied it to study the enzyme catalytic mechanism. The proposed catalytic residues His41 and Cys145 were confirmed to be critical for catalysis by mutating to Ala, while the Cys145 to Ser mutation resulted in an active enzyme with a 40-fold lower activity. From the pH dependency of catalytic activity, the pK(a)'s for His41 and Cys145 in the wild-type enzyme were estimated to be 6.38 and 8.34, while the pK(a)'s for His41 and Ser145 in the C145S mutant were estimated to be 6.15 and 9.09, respectively. The C145S mutant has a normal isotope effect in D(2)O for general base catalysis, that is, reacts slower in D(2)O, while the wild-type enzyme shows an inverse isotope effect which may come from the lower activation enthalpy. The pK(a) values measured for the active site residues and the activity of the C145S mutant are consistent with a general base catalysis mechanism and cannot be explained by a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair model.","Huang, Changkang; Wei, Ping; Fan, Keqiang; Liu, Ying; Lai, Luhua",Biochemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15078103/,251

The frequency of HRV-associated illnesses appears greater when PCR assays are used to detect rhinoviruses. The present study performed PCR-based detection of HRV upon entry of subjects into respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza type 3 vaccine trials when subjects were symptom-free and upon subsequent development of clinical symptoms of respiratory illness during the trial. The background of HRV PCR positivity in symptom-free individuals (30/139 [22%]) was only slightly lower than in those with respiratory illness (28/77 [36%]). For subjects with multiple samples, it was estimated that HRV was detectable by PCR for approximately 100 days before, during, and after clinical symptoms were documented. PCR is a remarkably more sensitive method of detecting HRV than is tissue culture. The presence of HRV RNA may not always reflect an association with infectious virus production. The limited association of HRV RNA with illness suggests caution in assigning causality of HRV PCR positivity to clinical symptoms of respiratory illness.","Wright, Peter F; Deatly, Anne M; Karron, Ruth A; Belshe, Robert B; Shi, Jian R; Gruber, William C; Zhu, Yuwei; Randolph, Valerie B",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17475758/,251
197826,The influence of preoperative MRI in early breast cancer: gold standard.,2020,"Previously, we identified an HBV binding factor (HBV-BF), a 50-kDa serum glycoprotein which interacts with HBV envelope proteins and which is also located in the membrane of normal human hepatocyte (A. Budkowska et al. (1993) J. Virol. 67, 4316). Here we show that HBV-BF is a neutral metalloproteinase which shares substrate specificity and properties with a newly described family of membrane type matrix metalloproteinases. HBV-BF treatment of the HBV resulted in the cleavage of the N-terminal part of the middle HBV envelope protein at the pre-S2(136-141) amino acid sequence VRGLYF/L (containing a single arginine cleavage site). HBV-BF affected the reactivity of the large HBV protein with pre-S1-specific MAbs, probably inducing the conformational change of the pre-S1 domain. The HBV-BF-digested virus remained morphologically intact with unchanged S antigenic determinants. The structural modifications of the viral envelope proteins induced by HBV-BF enabled cell membrane attachment and viral entry into the T-lymphocyte. Both processes were blocked by the metalloproteinase inhibitor 1,10 phenanthroline. Thus, the host-dependent proteolytic activation of the envelope proteins seems to be essential for the HBV entry into the cell. HBV-BF under a membrane bound or a secreted form could be (one of) the molecule(s) responsible for the HBV proteolytic activation.","Budkowska, A; Maillard, P; Theret, N; Groh, F; Possehl, C; Topilko, A; Crainic, R",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9344903/,251

Harmonic Focus versus Biclamp 150.,2015,"The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has hit health-care systems and societies in an unprecedented manner. In 1981, the first cases of AIDS were reported and wide diagnostic testing helped to characterize high-risk groups and the global burden of the epidemic. With Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19, everything has happened too fast and both cases and fatalities are huge but still uncertain in most places. Diagnostic testing of active and past SARS-CoV-2 infections needs to expand rapidly, ideally using rapid tests. COVID-19 deaths are highly concentrated in the elderly population, with a large proportion of fatalities being ""with"" rather than ""by"" SARS-CoV-2 infection. They are often the result of inadequate health care due to overwhelming demands. To date, there is no specific therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several antivirals are being tested clinically, including remdesivir, at this time the most promising. For others such as lopinavir/ritonavir, neither significant virological nor clinical benefit has been shown. Given the characteristic pulmonary cytokine storm underlying the pathogenic mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, antiinflammatory agents are being investigated. The benefit of orticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, etc., is limited. Monoclonal antibodies targeting different pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin 6 agent, are being tried with encouraging results. Ultimately a protective vaccine will be the best response for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.","Soriano, Vicente; Barreiro, Pablo; Ramos, José Manuel; Eirós, José M; de Mendoza, Carmen",AIDS reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412509/,251

Multiplex real-time PCR platforms are becoming increasingly common in laboratories mostly in relation to the increased diagnostic sensitivity and reduced turnaround time. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of respiratory viruses in a population of patients within the S.S. Antonio e Biagio e Cesare Arrigo General Hospital catchment area of Alessandria, Italy, from January 2016 to June 2020. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the results of multiplex real-time PCR performed on nasopharyngeal swabs collected from consecutive patients with symptoms of respiratory infection. A total of 572 patients were included in the study subdivided as follows: pediatric 197/572 (34.4%), adults 200/572 (35%) and elderly 175/572 (30.6%). Among all samples, 235/572 (41.1%) were positive for a respiratory virus, of whom 189/235 (80.4%) were monomicrobial. The prevalence was: 15.5% (89/572) of rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV); 9.4% (54/572) of RSV; 8.9% (51/572) of influenza virus; 5.4% (31/572) of AdV; 3.1% (18/572) of HCoV; 2.8% (16/572) of HPIV; and 2.3% (13/572) of HMPV. RV/EV were the pathogens most frequently involved in coinfections (34.7%, 16/46), followed by AdV (19.6%, 9/46) and influenza virus (19.6%, 9/46). Samples collected from the pediatric group were more frequently positive. The prevalence of positive pediatric samples compared to adults and elderly, respectively was: 28.4% (56/197) for RV/EV vs 10.5% (21/200) vs 6.9% (12/175), p>0.0001; 18.8% (37/197) for RSV vs 2% (4/200) vs 7.4% (13/175), p>0.0001; 13.7% (27/197) for AdV vs 1% (2/200) vs 1.1% (2/175), p>0.0001; and 6.6% (13/197) for HPIV vs 0.5% (1/200) vs 1.1% (2/175), (p>0.0001).

Current guidelines are divergent, sometimes contradictory, and often insufficiently detailed to guide practice decisions. OBJECTIVES This study aimed at establishing treatment recommendations at the patient-specific level. STUDY DESIGN Using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method (RAM), the appropriateness of different treatment options for osteoporotic VCFs was assessed. SETTING The assessment was conducted by a European multidisciplinary panel of 12 experts. METHODS The appropriateness of non-surgical management (NSM), vertebroplasty (VP), and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) was determined for 128 hypothetical patient profiles. These were unique combinations of clinical factors considered relevant to treatment choice (time since fracture, MRI findings, impact and evolution of symptoms, spinal deformity, ongoing fracture process, and pulmonary dysfunction). After 2 individual rating rounds and plenary meetings, appropriateness statements (appropriate, inappropriate, and uncertain) were calculated for all clinical scenarios. RESULTS Disagreement dropped from 31% in the first round to 7% in the second round. Appropriateness outcomes showed specific patterns for the 3 treatments. For three-quarters of the profiles, only one treatment was considered appropriate: NSM 25%, VP 6%, and BKP 45%. NSM was usually appropriate in patients with a negative MRI or a positive MRI without other unfavorable conditions (poor outcomes for the other variables). VP was usually appropriate in patients with a positive MRI, time since fracture ≥ 6 weeks, and no spinal deformity. BKP was recommended for all patients with an ongoing fracture process, and also in most patients with a positive MRI and ≥ 1 other unfavorable factor. LIMITATIONS The prevalence of the patient profiles in daily practice is yet unknown. CONCLUSION The panel results may help to support treatment choice in the heterogeneous population of patients with osteoporotic VCF.","Anselmetti, Giovanni Carlo; Bernard, Jason; Blattert, Thomas; Court, Charles; Fagan, Daniel; Fransen, Hendrik; Fransen, Patrick; Sabharwal, Tarun; Schils, Frederic; Schupfner, Rupert; Siddiqi, Mashood Ali; Stoevelaar, Herman; Kasperk, Christian",Pain physician,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24077202/,251

Hypovitaminosis D may have additional effect in the development of hypocalcemia. This study aimed to determine the effect of total thyroidectomy on postoperative serum calcium in patients with and without hypovitaminosis D. METHODS This prospective study was performed on patients who underwent total thyroidectomy from 2011 to 2014 in Imam Khomeini General Hospital of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. Serum calcium and vitamin D values were recorded before and after surgery. The patients were classified according to serum vitamin D concentrations as less 10 ng/ml (vitamin D deficiency) or higher (control group). The mean values of postoperative calcium level for each class of serum vitamin D were determined and compared. Hypocalcemia was defined as a postoperative calcium level <8 mg/dl. RESULTS 125 patients due to thyroid disease underwent total thyroidectomy. The incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic hypocalcemia after surgery was 12% (n=15) and 3.2% (n=4) respectively. 82 (65.6%) patients had vitamin D deficiency and 43 (34.4%) patients had sufficient vitamin D level. There was not any significant difference in calcium level (8.67±0.58 mg/dl vs. 8.70±0.59 mg/dl) between two vitamin D studied groups after thyroid surgery (p>0.05). CONCLUSION The findings of this study indicated that vitamin D deficiency had no significant effect on post-thyroidectomy serum calcium level.,"Godazandeh, Gholamali; Kashi, Zahra; Godazandeh, Farnaz; Tayebi, Pouya; Bijani, Ali",Caspian journal of internal medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26221503/,251
200014,Blood omega-3 fatty acids and death from COVID-19: A pilot study,2021,"AIM To assess the possible effect of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine on severe acute respiratory syndromes. METHODS The current available randomized controlled trials of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine on SARS were identified through systematically searching literature in any languages or any types of publications. Additional studies of gray literature were also collected. The quality of studies was evaluated by two investigators independently based largely on the quality criteria specified CONSORT. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using RevMan 4.2.0 software developed by the Cochrane Collaboration. RESULTS Six studies (n = 366) fulfilling the inclusion criteria were found, of which the quality of one study was graded as B, the remaining five were graded as C. Two studies were performed with meta-analysis, the other four studies existed some heterogeneity for which meta-analysis could not be performed, a significant effect on lung infiltrate absorption was found in the treatment groups of these two studies (RR 6.68, 95% CI (2.93, 15.24), P<0.01), there was no significant differences between the mortality (RR 0.86, 95% CI (0.22, 3.29), P = 0.82) and the average dosage of corticosteroid (WMD -39.65, 95% CI (-116.84, 37.54), P = 0.31). The other three studies also showed significant differences in infiltrate absorption, including national drug No. 2. 3. 4 in combination with Western medicine (RR 5.45, 95% CI (1.54, 19.26)), compound formulas NO. 1 combined with Western medicine (WMD 0.24, 95% CI (0.02, 0.46)), compound formulas combined with Western medicine (RR 8.06, 95% CI (0.40, 163.21)). Kangfeidian No.4 in combination with Western medicine had no significant effect on symptom improvement such as loss of dyspnea and cough (RR 1.50, 95%CI (0.41, 5.43)) and (RR 1.29, 95%CI (0.30, 5.43)). CONCLUSION Integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicines has some positive effects on lung infiltrate absorption in SARS patients, and is recommended as an adjunct treatment for SARS. However, its effect on SARS requires further careful study due to limited available randomized control trials.","Zhang, Ming-Ming; Liu, Xue-Mei; He, Lin",World journal of gastroenterology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15526373/,251
200160,It's always about numerators and denominators (N/D),2020,"The molecular technique of RNA fingerprinting was used to characterize the genomes of 5 isolates of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV): 2 viral pairs from the same animal, BVD-ILN/BVD-ILC and BVD-TGAN/BVD-TGAC, and the cytopathic viral prototype, BVD-NADL. Oligonucleotide patterns from the viruses were compared, and unique and overlapping oligonucleotides were identified. A comparison of the fingerprints indicated that the genome of each virus was distinguishable by the T1 RNase oligonucleotide fingerprinting technique. The greatest similarity observed was between oligonucleotides from BVD-ILC and BVD-ILN. Eighteen large oligonucleotides were conserved in all 5 BVDV isolates studied. We found that within a pair of BVDV, the cytopathic fingerprint was different from the noncytopathic fingerprint, indicating that cytopathic and noncytopathic BVDV may be distinct viruses.","Bissey, L L; Williams, A K; Bolin, S; Collisson, E W","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1645593/,251

200670,Reactive arthritis after COVID-19 vaccination,2021,"INTRODUCTION Prompted by reports of thromboembolic events - some with fatal outcomes - among people who had received the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine from Oxford-AstraZeneca against COVID-19, a number of European countries paused vaccination with this vaccine in early and mid-March 2021. Prior studies have suggested that vaccine willingness is highly dependent on public trust in the safety of vaccines. We therefore investigated whether vaccine willingness dropped in the wake of the reported cases of thromboembolic events in relation to the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS Using longitudinal survey data from Denmark, we compared vaccine willingness shortly before and after the reported cases of thromboembolic events, as well as the perceived safety of the two most widely used COVID-19 vaccines in Denmark - those from Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - in the wake of these events. RESULTS We found sustained vaccine willingness after the reported cases of thromboembolic events (89% both before and after). However, the safety of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine was perceived to be significantly and substantially lower than the safety of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech, and this difference was particularly pronounced among those who were vaccine-hesitant. CONCLUSIONS The vaccine willingness of Danes does not seem to have been affected by the reports of thromboembolic events in relation to the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.

In this study, a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) (291-LQLDGLHL-298) present in the C-terminal region of the IBV N protein was analyzed by using alanine substitution and deletion mutagenesis to investigate the relative contributions that leucine residues make to nuclear export and where these residues are located on the structure of the IBV N protein. The analysis indicated that Leu296 and Leu298 are required for efficient nuclear export of the protein. Structural information indicated that both of these amino acids are available for interaction with protein complexes involved in this process. However, export of N protein from the nucleus/nucleolus was not inhibited by leptomycin B treatment, indicating that N protein nuclear export is independent of the CRM1-mediated export pathway.","Reed, Mark L; Howell, Gareth; Harrison, Sally M; Spencer, Kelly-Anne; Hiscox, Julian A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17202223/,251

A survey conducted during the last week of March 2020 showed that 72% of Americans felt that their lives were impacted by the outbreak, which was a 32% increase from the survey conducted only 2 weeks earlier. The results show a positive correlation between COVID-19 infections/casualties and growing public concern. These observations suggest possible increase in mental health illnesses in United States as a consequence of the pandemic. The authors review a recently published model on COVID-19 related fear among the people. The fear of being infected or dying from the disease is one of the most significant causes of mental health disorders.

206073,The cardiovascular disorders and prognostic cardiac biomarkers in COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a cytokine storm syndrome associated with mortality rates of up to 88%. Standard therapy with high-dose glucocorticoids and etoposide used in adults is extrapolated from pediatric trials, with significant toxicity in older patients and those with poor performance status. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has recently gained attention as a treatment option for HLH due to its broad cytokine-modulating abilities and safety profile. Herein we report our center's experience using ruxolitinib in the treatment of adult-onset secondary HLH. CASE SERIES: We report four patients with profound secondary HLH provoked by diverse triggers, including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis on background systemic lupus erythematosus, disseminated tuberculosis, and T-cell lymphoma treated with ruxolitinib as monotherapy or combination therapy in upfront and salvage settings. RESULTS: All four patients had rapid, sustained improvement in clinical status, inflammatory markers, and hematological cell counts followed by durable remission. Three patients developed manageable infectious complications postruxolitinib. CONCLUSIONS: This series demonstrates the effective use of JAK inhibition with ruxolitinib to control pathological immune activation in critically ill patients with secondary HLH and otherwise limited therapeutic options. JAK inhibition is also an area of urgent investigation for the treatment of cytokine storm associated with COVID-19.","Hansen, Sarah; Alduaij, Waleed; Biggs, Catherine M; Belga, Sara; Luecke, Kai; Merkeley, Hayley; Chen, Luke Y C",Eur. j. haematol,,251

To control the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, it is necessary to understand how the virus is transmitted to a susceptible individual and eventually spread in the community. The primary transmission pathway of COVID-19 is human-to-human transmission through infectious droplets. However, a recent study by Greenhalgh et al. (Lancet: 397:1603-1605, 2021) demonstrates 10 scientific reasons behind the airborne transmission of SARS-COV-2. In the present study, we introduce a novel mathematical model of COVID-19 that considers the transmission of free viruses in the air besides the transmission of direct contact with an infected person. The basic reproduction number of the epidemic model is calculated using the next-generation operator method and observed that it depends on both the transmission rate of direct contact and free virus contact. The local and global stability of disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is well established. Analytically it is found that there is a forward bifurcation between the DFE and an endemic equilibrium using central manifold theory. Next, we used the nonlinear least-squares technique to identify the best-fitted parameter values in the model from the observed COVID-19 mortality data of two major districts of India. Using estimated parameters for Bangalore urban and Chennai, different control scenarios for mitigation of the disease are investigated. Results indicate that when a vaccine crisis is there, the public health authorities should prefer to vaccinate the susceptible people compared to the recovered persons who are now healthy. Along with face mask use, treatment of hospitalized patients and vaccination of susceptibles, immigration should be allowed in a supervised manner so that economy of the overall society remains healthy.","Pal, Saheb; Ghosh, Indrajit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12785v1.pdf,251

212095,An extraordinary World Encephalitis Day,2021,"The novel COVID-19 pandemic has created chaos around the globe. To curb its spread, the Government of India announced a nationwide lockdown on March 24th, 2020 for 21 days, which was extended further for a longer time. This long period of lockdown disrupted the routine of all citizens, affecting their psychological well-being. While recent studies showed the psychological burden of Indians during the pandemic, no study has assessed whether the psychological toll changed over time due to repeated extensions of the lockdown. We followed up 159 Indian adults during the first two months of the lockdown to assess any change in their anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms. Multilevel linear regression models of repeated observations nested within individuals adjusted for sociodemographic covariates showed that anxiety (ß = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.03, 1.60), stress (ß = 0.51, CI: 0.32, 0.70), and depressive symptoms (ß = 0.37, CI: 0.13, 0.60) increased over time during the lockdown. This increase was higher among women than men independent of covariates. Individual resilience was negatively associated with adverse psychological outcomes. Our findings suggested that while the lockdown may help in effectively addressing this pandemic, the state and society at large need to be sensitive to the mental health impacts of a long-drawn-out lockdown. Such effects likely have long-term sequelae. The disproportionate impact on women needs immediate attention. Moreover, it behooves society to address the root causes driving the unequal distribution of psychological distress during such crises.","Gopal, Anvita; Sharma, Anupam Joya; Subramanyam, Malavika Ambale",PLoS One,,251

To date, no study has been published on viral kinetics during the preclinical and clinical periods of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A confirmed case was defined as a patient with positive results by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2. Both specimen types were collected over the whole clinical course in all patients. Asymptomatic patients who had been screened for COVID-19 due to a strong epidemiological link were also enrolled. The study population included 54 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 shows a very high viral load on the day of symptom development, which then decreases overall. Rapid viral proliferation was observed 0-5 days before symptoms developed. Cycle threshold (Ct) value was the lowest in the clinical course from 5 days before symptoms to 10 days after symptoms occurred (Ct < 30). The rRT-PCR results were negative approximately 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms. However, there was a continuous pattern that was negative and positive for up to 6 weeks and more. CONCLUSION: Considering the characteristic that COVID-19 has a high viral load before symptoms appear, it is necessary to consider to expand the scope of epidemiological investigations. As there is a very low possibility of transmission after 10 days of symptom occurrence, it may be considered to release isolation after 10 days of symptom occurrence in limited resource situations. This study allows for the planning of epidemiological investigations, patient's ward supply, and follow-up of patients through sequential changes in viral loads over the entire clinical course. In addition, it is possible to estimate the clinical time at which the patient is present.","Jang, Sukbin; Rhee, Ji-Young; Wi, Yu Mi; Jung, Bo Kyeung",Int J Infect Dis,,251
213574,Resident Education and Redeployment During a Disaster,2021,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a novel infection which has spread rapidly across the globe and currently presents a grave threat to the health of vulnerable patient populations like those with malignancy, elderly, and immunocompromised. Healthcare systems across the world are grappling with the detrimental impact of this pandemic while learning about this novel disease and concurrently developing vaccines, strategies to mitigate its spread, and treat those infected. Cancer patients today face with a unique situation. They are susceptible to severe clinically adverse events and higher mortality from COVID-19 infection as well as morbidity and mortality from their underlying malignancy. Conclusion: Our review suggests increased risk of mortality and serious clinical events from COVID-19 infection in cancer patients. However, risk of adverse events does not seem to be increased by cancer therapies. True impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients will unravel over the next few months. We have also reviewed clinical features of COVID-19, recent recommendations from various medical, surgical, and radiation oncology societies for major solid tumor types like lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer during the duration of this pandemic.","Madan, Ankit; Siglin, Joshua; Khan, Aleem",Cancer Med,,251

We aimed to describe the clinical outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients and assess the impact on the use of hospital resources and compare with critically ill medical patients without COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to a private ICU in Sao Paulo, Brazil from March to June 2020. We compared these patients with those admitted to the unit in the same period of the previous year. A total of 212 consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were compared with 185 medical patients from the previous year. Patients with COVID-19 were more frequently males (76% vs. 56%, p<0.001) and morbidly obese (7.5% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.027), and had lower SAPS 3 (49.65 (12.19) vs. 55.63 (11.94), p<0.001) and SOFA scores (3.78 (3.53) vs. 4.48 (3.11), p = 0.039). COVID-19 patients had a longer ICU stay (median of 7 vs. 3 days, p<0.001), longer duration of mechanical ventilation (median of 9 vs. 4 days, p = 0.003), and more frequent tracheostomies (10.8 vs. 1.1%, p<0.001). Survival rates until 28 days were not statistically different (91% vs. 85.4%, p = 0.111). After multivariable adjustment for age, gender, SAPS 3, and Charlson Comorbidity Index, COVID-19 remained not associated with survival at 28 days (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.33-1.06, p = 0.076). Among patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, the observed mortality at 28-days was 16.2% in COVID-19 patients compared to 34.6% in the previous year. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 required more hospital resources, including invasive and non-invasive ventilation, had a longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and a more prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay. There was no difference in all-cause mortality at 28 and 60 days, suggesting that health systems preparedness be an important determinant of clinical outcomes.","Socolovithc, Rachel Lane; Fumis, Renata Rego Lins; Tomazini, Bruno Martins; Pastore, Laerte; Galas, Filomena Regina Barbosa Gomes; de Azevedo, Luciano Cesar Pontes; Costa, Eduardo Leite Vieira",PLoS One,,251
218493,Immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory potential of crocin in COVID-19 treatment,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed an immense burden on healthcare systems worldwide. There is intensive research targeted at better understanding of the virus pathogenicity, development of effective treatment strategies and vaccines against COVID-19. It is increasingly being recognised that the pathogenicity of COVID-19 extends beyond the respiratory system. In severe cases, there can be widespread activation of the immune system, vascular injury and a resultant pro-thrombotic state. Severe COVID-19 is widely regarded as a risk factor for venous thromboembolism. Interim European and American guidelines have been created to guide anticoagulation strategies in COVID-19 patients. However, it is unclear if these guidelines can be extrapolated directly to Asians, in whom there are differences in the baseline risk of thrombosis and bleeding. Our review article aimed to summarise the current understanding of arteriovenous thromboembolic complications in COVID-19 and discuss management strategies for prevention and treatment of thrombotic events in Asian COVID-19 patients.","Poh, Kai Chin; Tay, Victoria Yu Jia; Lin, Sarah Huixin; Chee, Huei Leng; Suhitharan, Thangavelautham",Singap. med. j,,251
218655,T cells found in coronavirus patients 'bode well' for long-term immunity,2020,"PURPOSE: The high infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 necessitates the need for multiple studies identifying the molecular mechanisms that facilitate the viral entry and propagation. Currently the potential extra-respiratory transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. METHODS: Using single-cell RNA Seq and ATAC-Seq datasets and immunohistochemical analysis, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 tropism in the embryonic, fetal and adult human ocular surface. RESULTS: The co-expression of ACE2 receptor and entry protease TMPRSS2 was detected in the human adult conjunctival, limbal and corneal epithelium, but not in the embryonic and fetal ocular surface up to 21 post conception weeks. These expression patterns were corroborated by the single cell ATAC-Seq data, which revealed a permissive chromatin in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 loci in the adult conjunctival, limbal and corneal epithelium. Co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was strongly detected in the superficial limbal, corneal and conjunctival epithelium, implicating these as target entry cells for SARS-CoV-2 in the ocular surface. Strikingly, we also identified the key pro-inflammatory signals TNF, NFKß and IFNG as upstream regulators of the transcriptional profile of ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in the superficial conjunctival epithelium, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may utilise inflammatory driven upregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression to enhance infection in ocular surface. CONCLUSIONS: Together our data indicate that the human ocular surface epithelium provides an additional entry portal for SARS-CoV-2, which may exploit inflammatory driven upregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 entry factors to enhance infection.","Collin, Joseph; Queen, Rachel; Zerti, Darin; Dorgau, Birthe; Georgiou, Maria; Djidrovski, Ivo; Hussain, Rafiqul; Coxhead, Jonathan M; Joseph, Agatha; Rooney, Paul; Lisgo, Steven; Figueiredo, Francisco; Armstrong, Lyle; Lako, Majlinda",Ocular surf,,251

The stretch of Tawi river particularly in the Jammu city is experiencing pollution load and the quality is degraded. The present study highlights the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the water quality of Tawi river in Jammu, J&K Union Territory. Water quality data based upon the real-time water monitoring for four locations (Below Tawi Bridge, Bhagwati Nagar, Belicharana and Surajpur) have been obtained from the web link of Jammu and Kashmir Pollution Control Board. The important parameters used in the present study include pH, alkalinity, hardness, conductivity, BOD and COD. The river was designated fit for bathing in all the monitoring locations except Bhagwati Nagar which recorded a BOD value >5 mg/L because of domestic sewage and municipal waste dumping. The overall water quality in the river during lockdown was good and falls in Class B with pH (7.0-8.5), alkalinity (23.25-185.0 mg/L), hardness (84.25-177.5 mg/L), conductivity (117-268 ms/cm). The improved water quality obtained during lockdown is never long-lasting as evident from the BOD and COD values observed during Unlock 1.0 due to accelerated anthropogenic activities in response to overcoming the economic loss, bringing the river water quality back to the degraded state. The statistical analysis known as cluster analysis has also been performed to evaluate the homogeneity of various monitoring sites based on the physicochemical variables. The need of the hour is to address the gaps of rejuvenation strategies and work over them for effective river resiliency and for sustainable river basin management.","Kour, Gagandeep; Kothari, Richa; Dhar, Sunil; Pathania, Deepak; Tyagi, V V",Energy Ecol Environ,,251

Racial and ethnic health disparities such as these are frequently aggravated by inequitable access to healthcare resources in disadvantaged communities. Yet, no known studies have investigated disadvantaged communities' access to COVID-19-related healthcare resources. The current study accordingly examined racial and ethnic differences in (1) April 2020 COVID-19 total and positive viral test rates across 177 New York City (NYC) ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA); and (2) November 2019-April 2020 licensed and intensive care unit (ICU) hospital bed access across 194 NYC ZCTAs. Pairwise analyses indicated higher COVID-19 total and positive test rates per 1000 persons in majority Black and Hispanic vs. majority White ZCTAs (CI [0.117, 4.55]; CI [2.53, 5.14]). Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that higher percentage of Black and Hispanic residents predicted more total COVID-19 tests per 1000 persons (p < 0.05). In contrast, majority Black and Hispanic ZCTAs had fewer licensed and ICU beds (CI [6.50, 124.25]; CI [0.69, 7.16]), with social disadvantage predicting lower licensed and ICU bed access per 1000 persons (p < 0.01). While news reports of inequitable access to COVID-19-related healthcare resources in ethnocultural minority communities have emerged, this is the first study to reveal that social disadvantage may be a major driver of hospital resource inequities in Black and Hispanic communities. Thus, it will be imperative to enact policies that ensure equitable allocation of healthcare resources to socially disadvantaged communities to address current and future public health crises.","Douglas, Jason A; Subica, Andrew M",Prev Med,,251
222840,Herbal approach for the management of C0VID-19: an overview,2020,"Background: The clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been well-studied, while effective predictors for clinical outcome and research on underlying mechanisms are scarce. Methods: Hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia patients with definitive clinical outcome (cured or died) were retrospectively studied. The diagnostic performance of the leucocyte subsets and other parameters were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Further, the correlations between leucocyte subsets and inflammation-related factors associated with clinical outcome were subsequently investigated. Results: Among 95 subjects included, 56 patients were cured, and 39 died. Older age, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, serum lactate dehydrogenase, blood urea nitrogen, prothrombin time, D-dimer, Procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein levels, decreased albumin, elevated serum cytokines (IL2R, IL6, IL8, IL10, and TNF-α) levels, and a decreased lymphocyte count indicated poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Lymphocyte subset (lymphocytes, T cells, helper T cells, suppressor T cells, natural killer cells, T cells+B cells+NK cells) counts were positively associated with clinical outcome (AUC: 0.777; AUC: 0.925; AUC: 0.900; AUC: 0.902; AUC: 0.877; AUC: 0.918, resp.). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil to T lymphocyte count ratio (NTR), neutrophil percentage to T lymphocyte ratio (NpTR) effectively predicted mortality (AUC: 0.900; AUC: 0.905; AUC: 0.932, resp.). Binary logistic regression showed that NpTR was an independent prognostic factor for mortality. Serum IL6 levels were positively correlated with leucocyte count, neutrophil count, and eosinophil count and negatively correlated with lymphocyte count. Conclusion: These results indicate that leucocyte subsets predict the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with high efficiency. Non-self-limiting inflammatory response is involved in the development of fatal pneumonia.","Gan, Jiahua; Li, Jingjing; Li, Shusheng; Yang, Chunguang",Front. Public Health,,251

Despite government's immediate actions and strict control, more and more people were infected every day. As such a contagious virus can spread easily and rapidly between people, the whole country was put into lockdown and people were forced into isolation. In order to understand the impact of Covid-19 on mental health well-being, Chinese researchers have conducted several studies. However, no consistent results were obtained. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted. METHODS: We searched Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases to find literature from December 2019 to April 2020 related to Covid-19 and mental health, among which results such as comments, letters, reviews and case reports were excluded. The incidence of anxiety and depression in the population was synthesized and discussed. RESULTS: A total of 27,475 subjects were included in 12 studies. Random effect model is used to account for the data. The results showed that the incidence of anxiety was 25% (95% CI: 0.19-0.32), and the incidence of depression was 28% (95% CI: 0.17-0.38). Significant heterogeneity was detected across studies regarding these incidence estimates. Subgroup analysis included the study population and assessment tools, and sensitivity analysis was done to explore the sources of heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the significant heterogeneity detected in studies regarding this pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression, we must interpret the results with caution. As the epidemic is ongoing, it is vital to set up a comprehensive crisis prevention system, which integrating epidemiological monitoring, screening and psychological crisis prevention and interventions.","Ren, Xin; Huang, Wanli; Pan, Huiping; Huang, Tingting; Wang, Xinwei; Ma, Yongchun",Psychiatr Q,,251

Nevertheless, variants of SARS-CoV-2 exist and may induce different symptoms; however, the factors and the impacts of these mutations are not well understood. We found that there is a bias to the mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 variants, with disproportionate mutation to uracil (U). These point mutations to U are mainly derived from cytosine (C), which is consistent with the substrate specificity of host RNA editing enzymes, APOBECs. We also found the point mutations which are consistent with other RNA editing enzymes, ADARs. For the C-to-U mutations, the context of the upstream uracil and downstream guanine from mutated position was found to be most prevalent. Further, the degree of increase of U in SARS-CoV-2 variants correlates with enhanced production of cytokines, such as TNF-&#945; and IL-6, in cell lines when compared with stimulation by the ssRNA sequence of the isolated virus in Wuhan. Therefore, RNA editing is a factor for mutation bias in SARS-CoV-2 variants, which affects host inflammatory cytokines production.","Kosuge, Masato; Furusawa-Nishii, Emi; Ito, Koyu; Saito, Yoshiro; Ogasawara, Kouetsu",Sci Rep,,251

We discuss the effect of nationwide lockdown implemented in India on March 25, 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model is used to forecast active COVID-19 cases in India considering the effect of nationwide lockdown and possible inflation in the active cases after its removal on May 3, 2020. Our model predicts that with the ongoing lockdown, the peak of active infected cases around 43,000 will occur in the mid of May, 2020. We also predict a 7 to 21% increase in the peak value of active infected cases for a variety of hypothetical scenarios reflecting a relative relaxation in the control strategies implemented by the government in the post-lockdown period. For India, it is an important decision to come up with a non-pharmaceutical control strategy such as nationwide lockdown for 40 days to prolong the higher phases of COVID-19 and to avoid severe load on its public health-care system. As the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak remains a global threat, it is a challenge for all the countries to come up with effective public health and administrative strategies to battle against COVID-19 and sustain their economies.","Pai, Chintamani; Bhaskar, Ankush; Rawoot, Vaibhav",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,251

Radiological imaging plays a key role in the diagnostic process and during the monitoring of the clinical conditions especially of patients with severe symptoms. According to the preliminary data collected in our tertiary center, we have documented a peculiar behavior in patients requiring endotracheal intubation who underwent seriate chest X-rays. In fact, the radiological pattern of COVID-19 patients may worsen despite a prompt amelioration after the onset of mechanical ventilation. Thus, according to our initial evidence, we recommend to perform seriate chest X-rays in the days following the onset of mechanical ventilation even if the immediate monitoring suggests an improvement. Studies on a larger scale are necessary to fully assess the findings at chest radiographs of critical, mechanically ventilated patients and their correlation with the long-term outcome.","Fichera, Giulia; Stramare, Roberto; De Conti, Giorgio; Motta, Raffaella; Giraudo, Chiara",Radiol Med,,251
225150,COVID-19 mRNA vaccines,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 had negative indirect health effects, as people seem to have been reluctant to seek medical care. METHODS: All emergency medical services (EMS) transports for chest pain or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the Dutch region Hollands-Midden (population served >â¯800,000) were evaluated during the initial 6 weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown and during the same time period in 2019. The primary endpoint was the number of evaluated chest pain patients in both cohorts. In addition, the number of EMS evaluations of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and OHCA were assessed. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 lockdown period, the EMS evaluated 927 chest pain patients (49% male, age 62â¯± 17 years) compared with 1041 patients (51% male, 63â¯± 17 years) in the same period in 2019, which corresponded with a significant relative risk (RR) reduction of 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81-0.96). Similarly, there was a significant reduction in the number of STEMI patients (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32-0.85), the incidence of OHCA remained unchanged (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.83-1.83). CONCLUSION: During the first COVID-19 lockdown, there was a significant reduction in the number of patients with chest pain or STEMI evaluated by the EMS, while the incidence of OHCA remained similar. Although the reason for the decrease in chest pain and STEMI consultations is not entirely clear, more attention should be paid to the importance of contacting the EMS in case of suspected cardiac symptoms in possible future lockdowns.","de Koning, E R; Boogers, M J; Bosch, J; de Visser, M; Schalij, M J; Beeres, S L M A",Neth. heart j,,251

226014,Views and experiences of youth participants in a pediatric advisory board for human subjects research,2021,"Most theories of intelligence do not directly address the question of whether people with high intelligence can successfully solve real world problems. A high IQ is correlated with many important outcomes (e.g., academic prominence, reduced crime), but it does not protect against cognitive biases, partisan thinking, reactance, or confirmation bias, among others. There are several newer theories that directly address the question about solving real-world problems. Prominent among them is Sternberg's adaptive intelligence with ""adaptation to the environment"" as the central premise, a construct that does not exist on standardized IQ tests. Similarly, some scholars argue that standardized tests of intelligence are not measures of rational thought-the sort of skill/ability that would be needed to address complex real-world problems. Other investigators advocate for critical thinking as a model of intelligence specifically designed for addressing real-world problems. Yes, intelligence (i.e., critical thinking) can be enhanced and used for solving a real-world problem such as COVID-19, which we use as an example of contemporary problems that need a new approach.","Halpern, D.

227417,"Letter to the Editor: Letter in Response to ""Receiving Patients with Vital Signs Absent from Paramedics""",2020,"Rationale: The glycocalyx is an extracellular matrix comprised of glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans, including heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), implicated in endothelial and epithelial inflammatory response. Acute lung injury alters glycocalyx integrity and increased HS and CS concentrations are measured in mice following inoculation with influenza virus. Staphylococcus aureus is Gram-positive bacterium implicated in postviral bacterial infections. Virulence factors including leukotoxins α hemolysin, Hla, and LukAB are critical for S. aureus immune evasion. Regulation of leukotoxin expression is not entirely understood. Evidence exists that HS can modulate the expression, implying glycosaminoglycans signal an opportunistic milieu for S. aureus to grow. In this experiment, we attempt to determine whether CS can exhibit similar leukotoxin modulation. Methods: In our first experiment, rat endothelial cell lines were cultured, plated into microplate with a fluorescent cell lysis indicator, and treated with varying concentrations of α-hemolysin or saline control. These preparations were treated with varying concentrations of CS or a media control. Fluorescence was measured hourly for 12 hours. In our second experiment, serial dilutions of CS were prepared with cultures of Methicillin resistant S. aureus. In two separate preparations, Hla or LukAB fluorescent indicator was added. Similarly, fluorescence was measured hourly for 12 hours. Results: In our first experiment, no definitive enhancement in cell lysis was observed across all concentrations of CS, regardless of the concentration of α hemolysin however there were data at 50 μg/mL which suggested increased cytotoxicity. In the second experiment, there was increase in expression of LukAB at intermediate concentrations of 12.5 and 18.75 μg/mL of CS as compared to control, observed first at approximately hour 8 and sustained throughout the experiment. The expression of Hla remained unchanged across all concentrations of CS. Similarly, bacterial growth measured in both preparations was unchanged across all concentrations of CS. Conclusions: We demonstrate that CS appears to increase the expression of LukAB at concentrations that are close to those measured in vivo with post-viral lavage. Our lab has demonstrated similar findings with HS. There was some suggestion that intermediate concentrations CS may increase cytotoxicity of α hemolysin however further investigation was delayed due to COVID-19. CS does not appear to have a direct effect on cell growth or the expression of Hla. Subsequent experiments from our lab seem to suggest that HS and CS do not directly induce S. aureus expression, but CS may be a part of more complex signaling pathway.","Rockstrom, M.; Languoet Astrie, C.; Schmidt, E.

Such interventions may be especially important for infants higher in emotional reactivity who need to regulate their emotions more frequently and intensely than infants lower in emotional reactivity. The current randomized trial examined main and moderated effects of an attachment-based intervention on (a) infants' use of mother-oriented and self-soothing emotion regulation strategies and (b) infant emotion dysregulation in 186 low-income, predominantly Latino infants. We tested the brief (10-session) Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) intervention in the context of home-based federal Early Head Start (EHS) services. Control participants received home-based EHS plus 10 weekly books. Intent-to-treat analyses with covariates revealed main effects of the intervention on infants' use of mother-oriented emotion regulation strategies during a brief (40-s) novel and potentially fear-inducing procedure (d = 0.31). Infant emotional reactivity moderated intervention impacts on mother-oriented emotion regulation strategies and on infant emotion dysregulation: We found stronger effects of the intervention for infants relatively higher in emotional reactivity. Findings are discussed in terms of the preventive value of attachment-based interventions for supporting early emotion regulation.","Hepworth, Allison D; Berlin, Lisa J; Martoccio, Tiffany L; Cannon, Erin N; Berger, Rebecca H; Harden, Brenda Jones",Prev. sci,,251

BACKGROUND: The currently used DES present certain features that have been linked separately to their better performance in terms of efficacy and safety. METHODS: First-in-man, prospective and multicenter study including patients treated with ihtDEStiny stent undergoing OCT examination at 9 months follow up. The ihtDEStiny stent is a sirolimus eluting stent with an oval shape ultrathin struts (68 µm) and an abluminal coating of a fluoropolymer containing the antiplatelet agent triflusal. Primary endpoint was the percentage of obstruction of the in-stent volume by the neointima. RESULTS: In 58 patients (63 lesions) in-stent late lumen loss was 0.11 ± 0.23 mm (95% CI 0.05-0.16) with only in 6% of stents being > 0.5 mm and in-segment binary stenosis was 1.6%. In OCT mean neointima volume obstruction was 10.5 ± 6.9% with a mean neointima thickness of 110.9 ± 89.8 µm. The proportion of uncovered struts was 2.5%, malapposed struts 1.1% and malapposed/uncovered struts 0.7% and no subclinical thrombi detected. Mean incomplete stent apposition area was 0.1 ± 0.1 mm2. At 12 months target lesion revascularization rate was 3% and no stent thrombosis was reported. CONCLUSIONS: In this study the ihtDEStiny stent has shown a very low degree of neointimal proliferation associated with a low rate of uncovered/malapposed struts and total absence of subclinical thrombi at 9 months follow up.","de la Torre Hernandez, Jose M; Otaegui, Imanol; Subinas, Asier; Gomez-Menchero, Antonio; Moreno, Raul; Rondan, Juan; Muñoz-Garcia, Erika; Sainz-Laso, Fermin; Garcia Del Blanco, Bruno; Rumoroso, Jose R; Diaz, Jose F; Berenguer, Alberto; Gomez-Lara, Josep; Zueco, Javier",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,,251

231697,Treatment of overweight and obesity during and after a pandemic. Let's not wait for the development of complications - new guidelines for doctors,2020,"BACKGROUND: Eradicating food insecurity is necessary for achieving global health goals. Liberal trade policies might increase food supplies but how these policies influence individual-level food insecurity remains uncertain. We aimed to assess the association between liberal trade policies and food insecurity at the individual level, and whether this association varies across country-income and household-income groups. METHODS: For this observational analysis, we combined individual-level data from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN with a country-level trade policy index from the Konjunkturforschungsstelle Swiss Economic Institute. We examined the association between a country's trade policy score and the probability of individuals reporting moderate-severe or severe food insecurity using regression models and algorithmic weighting procedures. We controlled for multiple covariates, including gross domestic product, democratisation level, and population size. Additionally, we examined heterogeneity by country and household income. RESULTS: Our sample comprised 460â102 individuals in 132 countries for the period of 2014-17. Liberal trade policy was not significantly associated with moderate-severe or severe food insecurity after covariate adjustment. However, among households in high-income countries with incomes higher than US$25â430 per person per year (adjusted for purchasing power parity), a unit increase in the trade policy index (more liberal) corresponded to a 0·07% (95% CI -0·10 to -0·04) reduction in the predicted probability of reporting moderate-severe food insecurity. Among households in the lowest income decile (<$450 per person per year) in low-income countries, a unit increase in the trade policy index was associated with a 0·35% (0·06 to 0·60) increase in the predicted probability of reporting moderate-severe food insecurity. INTERPRETATION: The relationship between liberal trade policy and food insecurity varied across countries and households. Liberal trade policy was predominantly associated with lower food insecurity in high-income countries but corresponded to increased food insecurity among the world's poorest households in low-income countries.

The aim of the study was to examine post-traumatic stress reactions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of symptom-defined post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and factors associated with post-traumatic stress in the Norwegian population during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. A survey was administered via social media channels, to which a sample of 4527 adults (&#8805;18 years) responded. Symptom-defined PTSD was measured with the PTSD Checklist for the DSM-5. The items were specifically linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the DSM-5 diagnostic guidelines to categorize participants as fulfilling the PTSD symptom criteria or not. Associations with PTSD were examined with single and multiple logistic regression analyses. The prevalence of symptom-defined PTSD was 12.5% for men and 19.5% for women. PTSD was associated with lower age, female gender, lack of social support, and a range of pandemic-related variables such as economic concerns, expecting economic loss, having been in quarantine or isolation, being at high risk for complications from COVID-19 infection, and having concern for family and close friends. In conclusion, post-traumatic stress reactions appear to be common in the Norwegian population in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak.

234770,The Scoliosis Research Society adult spinal deformity standard outcome set,2021,"Introduced by Kiefer and Wolfowitz \cite{KW56}, the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) is a widely used methodology for learning mixture odels and empirical Bayes estimation. Sidestepping the non-convexity in mixture likelihood, the NPMLE estimates the mixing distribution by maximizing the total likelihood over the space of probability measures, which can be viewed as an extreme form of overparameterization. In this paper we discover a surprising property of the NPMLE solution. Consider, for example, a Gaussian mixture model on the real line with a subgaussian mixing distribution. Leveraging complex-analytic techniques, we show that with high probability the NPMLE based on a sample of size $n$ has $O(\log n)$ atoms (mass points), significantly improving the deterministic upper bound of $n$ due to Lindsay \cite{lindsay1983geometry1}. Notably, any such Gaussian mixture is statistically indistinguishable from a finite one with $O(\log n)$ components (and this is tight for certain mixtures). Thus, absent any explicit form of model selection, NPMLE automatically chooses the right model complexity, a property we term \emph{self-regularization}. Extensions to other exponential families are given. As a statistical application, we show that this structural property can be harnessed to bootstrap existing Hellinger risk bound of the (parametric) MLE for finite Gaussian mixtures to the NPMLE for general Gaussian mixtures, recovering a result of Zhang \cite{zhang2009generalized}.","Polyanskiy, Yury; Wu, Yihong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08244v2.pdf,251

Objective: To determine whether discontinuation compared with continuation of ACEIs or ARBs changed the number of days alive and out of the hospital through 30 days. Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized clinical trial of 659 patients hospitalized in Brazil with mild to moderate COVID-19 who were taking ACEIs or ARBs prior to hospitalization (enrolled: April 9-June 26, 2020; final follow-up: July 26, 2020). Interventions: Discontinuation (n = 334) or continuation (n = 325) of ACEIs or ARBs. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the number of days alive and out of the hospital through 30 days. Secondary outcomes included death, cardiovascular death, and COVID-19 progression. Results: Among 659 patients, the median age was 55.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46.1-65.0 years), 14.7% were aged 70 years or older, 40.4% were women, and 100% completed the trial. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 6 days (IQR, 4-9 days) and 27.2% of patients had an oxygen saturation of less than 94% of room air at baseline. In terms of clinical severity, 57.1% of patients were considered mild at hospital admission and 42.9% were considered moderate. There was no significant difference in the number of days alive and out of the hospital in patients in the discontinuation group (mean, 21.9 days [SD, 8 days]) vs patients in the continuation group (mean, 22.9 days [SD, 7.1 days]) and the mean ratio was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-1.01). There also was no statistically significant difference in death (2.7% for the discontinuation group vs 2.8% for the continuation group; odds ratio [OR], 0.97 [95% CI, 0.38-2.52]), cardiovascular death (0.6% vs 0.3%, respectively; OR, 1.95 [95% CI, 0.19-42.12]), or COVID-19 progression (38.3% vs 32.3%; OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 0.95-1.80]). The most common adverse events were respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (9.6% in the discontinuation group vs 7.7% in the continuation group), shock requiring vasopressors (8.4% vs 7.1%, respectively), acute myocardial infarction (7.5% vs 4.6%), new or worsening heart failure (4.2% vs 4.9%), and acute kidney failure requiring hemodialysis (3.3% vs 2.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 and who were taking ACEIs or ARBs before hospital admission, there was no significant difference in the mean number of days alive and out of the hospital for those assigned to discontinue vs continue these medications. These findings do not support routinely discontinuing ACEIs or ARBs among patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 if there is an indication for treatment.

The aim of this study was to investigate how social restriction may have contributed to weight changes in adolescents with obesity. Secondary aim was to evaluate possible parameters influencing weight changes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Parameters of 51 obese adolescents were compared between two visits: within 2 months before 8 March, start of lockdown, and within 40 days after the end of it. RESULTS: Mean weight gain during lockdown was 2.8 ± 3.7 kg (p < 0.001). Weight increase was higher in males than in females (3.8 ± 3.4 kg vs 1.2 ± 3.7 kg, p = 0.02). The hours dedicated to SB increased (+2.9 ± 2.8 h/day; p < 0.001) while the hours of PA decreased (-1.0 ± 1.6 h/week; p < 0.001). Males spent more hours in SB than females (+3.8 ± 2.7 h/day vs +1.5 ± 2.5 h/day; p = 0.003). There were minor changes in diet during lockdown. The most significant variables influencing both delta BMI and waist/height ratio increase were hours devoted to SB during lockdown and differences in mild and moderate PA before and after lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Obese adolescents showed a worsening of obesity during lockdown, with males mainly affected, mainly due to a reduced mild PA and increased hours spent in SB.","Maltoni, Giulio; Zioutas, Maximiliano; Deiana, Giuseppina; Biserni, Giovanni Battista; Pession, Andrea; Zucchini, Stefano",Nutr. metab. cardiovasc. dis,,251

OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential targets and therapeutic drugs for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 through data mining and bioinformatics. METHODS: We integrated and profoundly analyzed 10 drugs previously assessed to have promising therapeutic potential in COVID-19 management, and have been recommended for clinical trials. To explore the mechanisms by which these drugs may be involved in the treatment of COVID-19, gene-drug interactions were identified using the DGIdb database after which functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and miRNA-gene network construction were performed. We adopted the DGIdb database to explore the candidate drugs for COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 43 genes associated with the 10 potential COVID-19 drugs were identified. Function enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were mainly enriched in response to other invasions, toll-like receptor pathways, and they play positive roles in the production of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and INF-ß. TNF, TLR3, TLR7, TLR9, and CXCL10 were identified as crucial genes in COVID-19. Through the DGIdb database, we predicted 87 molecules as promising druggable molecules for managing COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this work may provide new insights into COVID-19 mechanisms and treatments. Further, the already identified candidate drugs may improve the efficiency of pharmaceutical treatment in this rapidly evolving global situation.","Tan, Siyou; Chen, Wenyan; Xiang, Hongxian; Kong, Gaoyin; Zou, Lianhong; Wei, Lai",Genes Genomics,,251

245939,Hydroxychloroquine hitting the headlines-retinal considerations,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and spike protein are crucial for viral replication and transmission. Spike protein recognizes the human ACE2 receptor and transmits SARS-CoV-2 into the human body. Thus, Mpro, spike protein, and ACE2 receptor act as appropriate targets for the development of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Spices are traditionally known to have anti-viral and immune-boosting activities. Therefore, we investigated the possible use of selected spice bioactives against the potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 using computational analysis. METHODS: Molecular docking analysis was performed to analyze the binding efficiency of spice bioactives against SARS-CoV-2 target proteins along with the standard drugs. Drug-likeness properties of selected spice bioactives were investigated using Lipinski's rule of five and the SWISSADME database. Pharmacological properties such as ADME/T, biological functions, and toxicity were analyzed using ADMETlab, PASS-prediction, and ProTox-II servers, respectively. RESULTS: Out of forty-six spice bioactives screened, six bioactives have shown relatively better binding energies than the standard drugs and have a higher binding affinity with at least more than two targets of SARS-CoV-2. The selected bioactives were analyzed for their binding similarities with the standard drug, remdesivir, towards the targets of SARS-CoV-2. Selected spice bioactives have shown potential drug-likeness properties, with higher GI absorption rate, lower toxicity with pleiotropic biological roles. CONCLUSIONS: Spice bioactives have the potential to bind with the specific targets involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Therefore, spice-based nutraceuticals can be developed for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Natesh, Jagadish; Mondal, Priya; Penta, Dhanamjai; Abdul Salam, Abdul Ajees; Meeran, Syed Musthapa",Comput Biol Med,,251

Although it has already been identified in many organs, ACE2 expression remains largely unknown in the head and neck (HN) sphere. Thus, this study aims to investigate its protein expression in several sites of the upper aerodigestive tract in order to highlight potential routes of infection. We compared ACE2 immunohistochemical expression between 70 paraffin-embedded specimens with two different antibodies and reported the quantified expression in each histological location. Surprisingly, we obtained different results depending on the antibody, an absence of labeling having been observed with a monoclonal antibody raised against the extracellular domain, whereas the polyclonal, against the cytoplasmic part of the protein, revealed enriched ACE2 expression, particularly in sinuses, vocal cords, salivary glands and oral cavity epithelial cells. The interpretation of these discordant results has brought several exciting lines of reflection. In conclusion, this study provides possible routes of entry for the SARS-CoV-2 in HN region and, above all, has led us to encourage caution when studying the ACE2 expression which is currently at the center of all attention.","Descamps, Géraldine; Verset, Laurine; Trelcat, Anne; Hopkins, Claire; Lechien, Jérome R; Journe, Fabrice; Saussez, Sven",,,251

The current HPV detection systems aim mainly at mucosal HPVs, however, an efficient clinical approach for cutaneous HPVs detection is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To establish a rapid detection system for cutaneous HPVs using a colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) dye in combination with microfluidic technology. METHODS: L1 DNA sequences of the 30 cutaneous HPVs were chemically synthesized, and LAMP primers against L1 DNA were designed with use of an online LAMP designing tool. Isothermal amplification was performed with use of a water bath and the amplification results were inspected with the naked eye. Using PCR sequencing as a control method, the specificity and sensitivity of the new detection system were obtained by detecting clinical samples. RESULTS: The lower detection limit of the LAMP assay was 107 viral DNA copies/µl when tested on synthesized L1 DNA sequences, which was better than the conventional PCR. Compared to PCR sequencing, the sensitivity of HPV27, HPV2, HPV1, HPV57, HPV3, HPV4, HPV7 and HPV75 genotypes detections were 100%, whereas the specificity was 34.55, 45.12, 95.83, 98.59 and 97.62% respectively, when tested on clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: The new cutaneous type HPV detection system is characterized by both a good sensitivity and specificity compared to conventional methods.","Wang, Yining; Ge, Ge; Mao, Rui; Wang, Zhuo; Sun, Yu-Zhe; Du, Yu-Guang; Gao, Xing-Hua; Qi, Rui-Qun; Chen, Hong-Duo",Virol J,,251

Background: As the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic continues to expand globally, healthcare systems have become more overwhelmed than ever before, placing a great psychological strain on frontline nurses. Design: A cross-sectional, observational, quantitative study. Methods: In total, 215 frontline nurses working at 12 hospitals across Jazan, Saudi Arabia, were recruited. Data were collected during August 2020 using a modified version of the severe acute respiratory syndrome team questionnaire. Results: Roughly two-thirds (62.3%) of the participants reported moderate to high levels of nervousness and fear at work. Ethical and moral responsibility has been determined as the main motivator for frontline nurses to practice their profession, with 88% of them expressing a willingness to work even if the situation deteriorated further. However, 87% of the participants were extremely concerned about transmitting the disease to their family members. The most common coping strategy adopted by the nurses appeared to be adherence to strict protective measures (93.5%), followed by the acquisition of more knowledge about the disease (82.3%). Conclusion: Frontline nurses experience severe psychological stress, which is mainly caused by their fear of contracting the infection or passing it on to their family members. Thus, proper education, adherence to infection control protocols, effective social support system, and access to sufficient personal protective equipment will help nurses enhance their coping abilities. © The Author(s) 2021.","Al Muharraq, E.

Even in the most optimistic scenarios, vaccine shortages will likely occur. Using an age-stratified mathematical model paired with optimization algorithms, we determined optimal vaccine allocation for four different metrics (deaths, symptomatic infections, and maximum non-ICU and ICU hospitalizations) under many scenarios. We find that a vaccine with effectiveness &#8805;50% would be enough to substantially mitigate the ongoing pandemic, provided that a high percentage of the population is optimally vaccinated. When minimizing deaths, we find that for low vaccine effectiveness, irrespective of vaccination coverage, it is optimal to allocate vaccine to high-risk (older) age groups first. In contrast, for higher vaccine effectiveness, there is a switch to allocate vaccine to high-transmission (younger) age groups first for high vaccination coverage. While there are other societal and ethical considerations, this work can provide an evidence-based rationale for vaccine prioritization.","Matrajt, Laura; Eaton, Julia; Leung, Tiffany; Brown, Elizabeth R",Sci.

Detecting the pleural line pattern is an essential feature for further lung diagnosis based on machine learning. A healthy lung correlates with the regular repeated horizontal A-line with a fixed distance between the lines and, ideally, produces a higher intensity. This preliminary work focuses on developing an image processing framework for automatic pleural line (A-line) detection in time series B-mode ultrasound images (video) in a healthy subject as an early stage of further lung image interpretations COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The proposed scheme is based on a top-hat morphological grayscale filter with a texture structure element. An adaptive low pass filter that considers local shape parameter is used to suppress noise and keep the curve line information related to the pleural line. The proposed scheme is evaluated for an open dataset of video LUS. The proposed method can successfully detect the pleural line automatically for typical video LUS acquired using a curved transducer. © 2021 IEEE.","Susanti, H.; Suprijanto,","Proc. - IEEE EMBS Conf.

Metabolic activities are directly involved in modulating the immune responses against infectious diseases, yet our understanding remains limited on how host metabolism relates with inflammatory responses. To better elucidate the underlying biochemistry of leukocytes response, we focused our analysis on the possible relationships between SARS-CoV-2 post-infection stages and distinct metabolic pathways. Indeed, in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC, n=48) obtained 60-90 days after infection and showing in vitro IgG antibody memory for spike-S1 antigen (n=19), we observed a significant altered metabolism of tryptophan and urea cycle pathways. This work for the first time identifies metabolic routes in cell metabolism possibly related to later stages of immune defense against SARS-Cov-2 infection, namely when circulating antibodies may be absent, but an antibody memory is present. The results suggest a reprogramming of leukocyte metabolism after viral pathogenesis through activation of specific amino acid pathways possibly related to protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","Timperio, Anna Maria; Gevi, Federica; Fanelli, Giuseppina; Lelli, Veronica; Zarletti, Gianpaolo; Tiberi, Massimo; Molfetta, Veronica De; Scapigliati, Giuseppe",,,251

258407,"""Liquid biopsy"" for cancer screening",2021,"BACKGROUND: There has been growing international interest in performing remote consultations in primary care, particularly amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, the evidence surrounding the safety of remote consultations is inconclusive. The appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing in remote consultations is an important aspect of patient safety that needs to be addressed. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to summarize evidence on the impact of remote consultation in primary care with regard to antibiotic prescribing. METHODS: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, HMIC, PsycINFO, and CINAHL for literature published since the databases' inception to February 2020. Peer-reviewed studies conducted in primary health care settings were included. All remote consultation types were considered, and studies were required to report any quantitative measure of antibiotic prescribing to be included in this systematic review. Studies were excluded if there were no comparison groups (face-to-face consultations). RESULTS: In total, 12 studies were identified. Of these, 4 studies reported higher antibiotic-prescribing rates, 5 studies reported lower antibiotic-prescribing rates, and 3 studies reported similar antibiotic-prescribing rates in remote consultations compared with face-to-face consultations. Guideline-concordant prescribing was not significantly different between remote and face-to-face consultations for patients with sinusitis, but conflicting results were found for patients with acute respiratory infections. Mixed evidence was found for follow-up visit rates after remote and face-to-face consultations. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to confidently conclude that remote consulting has a significant impact on antibiotic prescribing in primary care. However, studies indicating higher prescribing rates in remote consultations than in face-to-face consultations are a concern. Further, well-conducted studies are needed to inform safe and appropriate implementation of remote consulting to ensure that there is no unintended impact on antimicrobial resistance.","Han, Seung Min; Greenfield, Geva; Majeed, Azeem; Hayhoe, Benedict",J Med Internet Res,,251

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 and the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on the personal hygiene and expectations in heart and lung transplant recipients. METHODS: A telephone survey of heart (n = 69) and lung (n = 41) transplant patients and a group of controls (n = 41) was conducted concerning personal hygiene before and after the outbreak; the impact on subjective expectations regarding graft outcome; symptoms possibly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; and diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: Seventy nine percent of the patients declared they increased the use of face masks and handwash. Behavior at home regarding self-isolation did not change. About half the patients said they were afraid of the virus. A higher percentage of Lung transplant (LTX) were convinced that SARS-CoV-2 could have a negative impact on the outcome of their graft. 28% declared that they were afraid to come to the hospital for routine examinations and asked to postpone. Nine LTX and five Heart transplant (HTX) patients experienced symptoms that could have been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but none of them underwent a nasopharyngeal swab. Only one LTX was diagnosed with the infection. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we observed a low incidence of COVID-19 in heart and lung transplant patients (0.9%), similar to that of the general population of our Region.

Although 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are very similar viruses genomically and structurally, the huge number of severe cases and deaths now being caused by 2019-nCoV infections has understandably prompted intense research on the receptor used by it to enter human cells. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a functional receptor for SARS-CoV, now appears likely to mediate 2019-nCoV entry into human cells. In this review, we describe the roles performed by ACE2 as an enzymatic catalyst and as a receptor for this novel coronavirus. We also summarize the latest research pertaining to the changes noted in ACE2 expression after viral binding, and the relationships relating to virus transmission and population susceptibility to it. Lastly, we speculate on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and provide a useful reference for drug development against this aggressive virus.","Wu, Jie; Deng, Wei; Li, Shumin; Yang, Xiuhong",Cell. mol. life sci,,251

The pandemic thereby exposes the grotesque disparities in how illness, death, and suffering are unevenly distributed. As the COVID-19 public health crisis has summarily provoked a global economic crisis, furthermore, it is simply unthinkable to comprehend the real ramifications of the pandemic outside of the sociopolitical relations of labor and capital, more generally. Furthermore, the global public health crisis commands that we reflect anew on the relations between human life and state power. Both for those who have historically and enduringly been subjected to expulsion from gainful employment, as for those whose labor-power is a commodity of choice for capital, exceedingly selected for hyper-exploitation, the coronavirus pandemic is a toxic matter of both class and race. These dire and increasingly desperate circumstances, however, reveal not only what is most barbaric about capitalist social relations but also the opportunity latent within this crisis.

We sought to evaluate outcomes of delayed intubation and examine the ROX index (ie, [[Formula: see text]]/breathing frequency) to predict weaning from high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study of subjects with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and managed with HFNC. The ROX index was applied to predict HFNC success. Subjects that failed HFNC were divided into early HFNC failure (&#8804; 48 h of HFNC therapy prior to mechanical ventilation) and late failure (> 48 h). Standard statistical comparisons and regression analyses were used to compare overall hospital mortality and secondary end points, including time-specific mortality, need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and ICU length of stay between early and late failure groups. RESULTS: 272 subjects with COVID-19 were managed with HFNC. One hundred sixty-four (60.3%) were successfully weaned from HFNC, and 111 (67.7%) of those weaned were managed solely in non-ICU settings. ROX index >3.0 at 2, 6, and 12 hours after initiation of HFNC was 85.3% sensitive for identifying subsequent HFNC success. One hundred eight subjects were intubated for failure of HFNC (61 early failures and 47 late failures). Mortality after HFNC failure was high (45.4%). There was no statistical difference in hospital mortality (39.3% vs 53.2%, P = .18) or any of the secondary end points between early and late HFNC failure groups. This remained true even when adjusted for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective review, HFNC was a viable strategy and mechanical ventilation was unecessary in the majority of subjects. In the minority that progressed to mechanical ventilation, duration of HFNC did not differentiate subjects with worse clinical outcomes. The ROX index was sensitive for the identification of subjects successfully weaned from HFNC. Prospective studies in COVID-19 are warranted to confirm these findings and to optimize patient selection for use of HFNC in this disease.","Chandel, Abhimanyu; Patolia, Saloni; Brown, A Whitney; Collins, A Claire; Sahjwani, Dhwani; Khangoora, Vikramjit; Cameron, Paula C; Desai, Mehul; Kasarabada, Aditya; Kilcullen, Jack K; Nathan, Steven D; King, Christopher S",Respir Care,,251

With the cases increasing daily, it is becoming more and more essential to understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the severity of the disease. It is now well known that the infection manifests itself primarily as respiratory, but the involvement of the other organ systems has now been documented in many studies. SARS-CoV-2 can invade the nervous system by a multitude of proposed mechanisms that have been discussed in this review. NF-&#954;B and Nrf2 are transcription factors that regulate genes responsible for inflammatory and anti-oxidant response respectively. Specific focus in this review has been given to NF-&#954;B and Nrf2 pathways that are involved in the cytokine storm and oxidative stress that are the hallmarks of COVID-19. As the immune injury is an important mechanism of neuro-invasion and neuroinflammation, there is the possible involvement of these two pathways in the neurological complications. The crosstalk mechanisms of these signaling pathways have also been discussed. Immuno-modulators both synthetic and natural are promising candidates in catering to the pathologies targeted in the aforementioned pathways.","Bhandari, Ranjana; Khanna, Garima; Kaushik, Dhriti; Kuhad, Anurag",Mol Neurobiol,,251

266026,COVID-19 treatment by repurposing drugs until the vaccine is in sight,2020,"Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality. Patients with severe forms of the disease are usually managed in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where they can develop secondary infections particularly bacterial, favored by prolonged intubation and central venous catheterization (CVC), hence increasing the disease’s mortality. Infectious endocarditis (IE) represents a rare and severe cardiovascular complication in patients with CVC. We report the case of a patient admitted to the ICU for an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID19. Her management included intubation and mechanical ventilation, CVC and treatment with Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and echocardiography findings were unremarkable. On the 10th day of onset, the patient developed septic shock and both echocardiography and blood cultures were in favor of A positive diagnosis of tricuspid valve infective endocarditis, accordingly to the modified Duke criteria. Specific treatment was started with a good clinical evolution. Our case outlines the difficulty of management of bacterial co-infections and superinfections in COVID-19 ICU patients, and particularly rare infections such as right-heart IE, which usually require a multidisciplinary approach and coordination between intensivits, cardiologists and infectiologists.","Benmalek, Rime; Mechal, Hanane; Choukrallah, Hamza; Maaroufi, Anas; Benouna, El Ghali; Habbal, Rachida; Aissaoui, Ouissal; Erragh, Anass; Nssiri, Afak; Alharrar, Rachid",Pan Afr.

No therapies or vaccines so far are recommended to treat or prevent the new coronavirus. A novel traditional Chinese medicine formula, Taiwan Chingguan Yihau (NRICM101), has been administered to patients with COVID-19 in Taiwan since April 2020. Its clinical outcomes and pharmacology have been evaluated. Among 33 patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted in two medical centers, those (n = 12) who were older, sicker, with more co-existing conditions and showing no improvement after 21 days of hospitalization were given NRICM101. They achieved 3 consecutive negative results within a median of 9 days and reported no adverse events. Pharmacological assays demonstrated the effects of the formula in inhibiting the spike protein/ACE2 interaction, 3CL protease activity, viral plaque formation, and production of cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;. This bedside-to-bench study suggests that NRICM101 may disrupt disease progression through its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, offering promise as a multi-target agent for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Tsai, Keng-Chang; Huang, Yi-Chia; Liaw, Chia-Ching; Tsai, Chia-I; Chiou, Chun-Tang; Lin, Chien-Jung; Wei, Wen-Chi; Lin, Sunny Jui-Shan; Tseng, Yu-Hwei; Yeh, Kuo-Ming; Lin, Yi-Ling; Jan, Jia-Tsrong; Liang, Jian-Jong; Liao, Chun-Che; Chiou, Wen-Fei; Kuo, Yao-Haur; Lee, Shen-Ming; Lee, Ming-Yung; Su, Yi-Chang",Biomed Pharmacother,,251

In addition, 27% of parents of children aged <18 years reported that their mental health had worsened during the pandemic (2). To examine mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic among U.S. adults on the basis of their classification as having a parenting role (i.e., unpaid persons caring for children and adolescents aged <18 years, referred to as children in this report) or being an unpaid caregiver of adults (i.e., persons caring for adults aged &#8805;18 years),§ CDC analyzed data from cross-sectional surveys that were administered during December 2020 and February-March 2021 for The COVID-19 Outbreak Public Evaluation (COPE) Initiative.¶ Respondents were categorized as parents only, caregivers of adults only, parents-caregivers (persons in both roles), or nonparents/noncaregivers (persons in neither role). Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for any adverse mental health symptoms, particularly suicidal ideation, were higher among all respondents who were parents, caregivers of adults, or both compared with respondents who were nonparents/noncaregivers and were highest among persons in both roles (parents-caregivers) (any adverse mental health symptoms: aOR = 5.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.1-6.2; serious suicidal ideation: aOR = 8.2, 95% CI = 6.5-10.4). These findings highlight that parents and caregivers, especially those balancing roles both as parents and caregivers, experienced higher levels of adverse mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic than adults without these responsibilities. Caregivers who had someone to rely on for support had lower odds of experiencing any adverse mental health symptoms. Additional measures are needed to improve mental health among parents, caregivers, and parents-caregivers.","Czeisler, Mark É; Rohan, Elizabeth A; Melillo, Stephanie; Matjasko, Jennifer L; DePadilla, Lara; Patel, Chirag G; Weaver, Matthew D; Drane, Alexandra; Winnay, Sarah S; Capodilupo, Emily R; Robbins, Rebecca; Wiley, Joshua F; Facer-Childs, Elise R; Barger, Laura K; Czeisler, Charles A; Howard, Mark E; Rajaratnam, Shantha M W",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,251
278309,COVID-19: A Global Threat to the Nervous System,2020,"BACKGROUND: Nurses who are one of the pivotal elements of countries' strategic responses to COVID-19 are being exposed to COVID-19. AIMS: To investigate the underlying characteristics of nurses who died due to COVID-19. METHODS: On 1 September 2020, a grey literature search was conducted. Data obtained through Medscape, Google, PubMed, government and non-government websites. The search strategy was carried out using variants and combinations of keywords related to 'nurse' and 'COVID-19' in English. Abstracted data included age, gender, type of nurse, department of nursing, country, date of death and publication characteristics. RESULTS: Out of reported 1518 COVID-19-related nurse deaths, details of age, gender and department of nursing were available for 766 (50%), 945 (62%) and 153 (10%) of nurses, respectively. The median age of the nurses was 56 years. The majority of deaths were reported in the 46- to 65 (32%)-year age range. While the registered nurses had the highest number of deaths according to types of nurses (680/957; 71%), they are mental health nurses (42/153; 28%) in the department of nursing. The countries with the most reported nurse deaths were USA, South Africa, Mexico and Russia.

278321,Duty to treat: where do the limits lie?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The severity of COVID-19 could be evaluated by examining several blood parameters mainly white blood cell (WBC) count, granulocytes, platelet, and novel hemocytometric markers neutrophils to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte (PLR), and lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR). The current study was conducted to investigate alteration in blood parameters and their association with the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients. METHODOLOGY: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted retrospectively, a total of 101 COVID-19 positive patients were examined: 52 were mild, 24 were moderate, 09 were severe, and 16 were critically diseased patients. We also recorded 16 deaths associated with the critical group. The overall mean age observed in our study was 48.94 years, where the mean age for critical individuals was 62.12 ± 14.35 years. RESULTS: A significant association between the disease severity and elevation in blood parameters were observed. The WBC's and granulocyte count were significantly increased (p value <0.001) while the mean platelet count (165.0 × 109 /L) and red blood cell volume distribution width (RDW) were decreased in the critical group (57.86%) compared to mild group's patients (177.3%) (p = 0.83). The lymphocytes count was decreased in critical patients (1.40 × 109 /L) compared to mild patients (1.92 × 109 /L) (p = 0.28). A significant association was observed in platelet-lymphocyte ratio (p < 0.001), Neutrophil-Lymphocyte ratio (p = <0.001), and Lymphocyte-Monocyte ratio (0.011). CONCLUSION: These blood parameters could be used as a suitable biomarker for the prognosis and severity of COVID-19. Evaluating novel hemograms NLR, PLR, and LMR can aid clinicians to identify potentially severe cases at early stages, initiate effective management in time, and conduct early triage which may reduce the overall mortality of COVID-19 patients.","Waris, Abdul; Din, Misbahud; Khalid, Atiqa; Abbas Lail, Raees; Shaheen, Asmat; Khan, Nida; Nawaz, Mehboob; Baset, Abdul; Ahmad, Imtiaz; Ali, Muhammad",J Clin Lab Anal,,251

METHODS: Mixed-method content analysis of 67 articles published in major Canadian English language newspapers between March 23 and April 1, 2020. Articles were analyzed and coded by two raters. Ratings were analyzed in SPSS. RESULTS: Few articles in the sample discussed essential healthcare services and the inclusion of liquor and cannabis stores in essential services lists. Majority of the articles that discussed both topics framed the discussion positively and consistently with current knowledge and evidence. CONCLUSION: Canadian print media representations of essential healthcare services and associated public debate are largely descriptive and, therefore, fail to engage critically with or advance public understanding of an important health policy issue.","Ogbogu, Ubaka; Hardcastle, Lorian",BMC Public Health,,251

287388,The Urgency of Justice in Research: Beyond COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Childhood obesity, with persistent chronic inflammation, is a worldwide epidemic. Obesity causes dysregulation throughout the immune system, affecting the balance and levels of cytokines, adipokines, and innate and adaptive immune cells. The present review focuses on the impact of obesity on immune function in children: altering the baseline activation state of immune cells and affecting the ability of the host to combat pathogens and malignancy and respond appropriately to vaccination. RECENT FINDINGS: Obesity causes dysregulation of the immune system. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of adipose tissue and resident immune cells is quantifying the impact of obesity on the frequency of immune cell subsets and their states. The system-wide alterations in immune function in obesity are most evident upon perturbation, including the response to infection (e.g. increased risk of severe COVID-19 in the ongoing pandemic), vaccination, and malignancy. However, mechanistic research in pediatric obesity is limited and this impacts our ability to care for these children. SUMMARY: We must better understand baseline and perturbed immune health in obese children to determine how to account for altered frequency and function of humoral and cellular immune components in acute infection, during vaccine design and when considering therapeutic options for this complex, medically vulnerable group.","Fang, Xingyuan; Henao-Mejia, Jorge; Henrickson, Sarah E",Curr Opin Pediatr,,251

The objectives of this study were to describe the baseline characteristics and changes of biomarkers of these COVID-19 patients and identify predictive value of the above markers for patient death. Using patient death as the observational endpoints, clinical data of inpatients in a special ward for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China were retrospectively collected. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate prognostic value of baseline characteristics and laboratory data changes. This study included clinical data of 75 patients. Age, c-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 levels were independent predictors of patient death. Survivors were characterized as having declining neutrophil counts, D-dimer, N-terminal pronatriuretic peptide, troponin I (TnI) and c-reactive protein levels, while counts of lymphocyte gradually came back. Non-survivors were characterized with increasing white blood cell counts (WBC) and neutrophil counts. Changes of WBC, TnI and interleukin-6 were also independently associated with patient death. Older age, baseline CRP and IL-6 levels may be used as meaningful predictors to identify patients with poor prognosis. Changes of biomarkers should be closely monitored in the management of patients with COVID-19, while constantly increasing levels of WBC, TnI and interleukin-6 in the disease course also predict patient death.","Li, Tao; Wang, Xin; Zhuang, Xianghua; Wang, Hui; Li, Ai; Huang, Laigang; Zhang, Xingqian; Xue, Yan; Wei, Fengtao; Ma, Cheng039; en,",Intern. emerg. med,,251

Within this spectrum, an involvement of the fetal-maternal unit could be expected, but, so far, the histopathological evaluation of placentas delivered by women with SARS-CoV-2 infection did not show distinct hallmarks. A consecutive series of 11 placentas, delivered by 10 women with COVID-19 admitted to our Obstetrics and Gynecology clinic have been investigated and compared to a control cohort of 58 pre-COVID-19 placentas and 28 placentas delivered by women who had a previous cesarean section. Four out of eleven placentas showed changes consistent with chronic villitis/villitis of unknown etiology (VUE), while in one case, chronic histiocytic intervillositis was diagnosed. Thrombo-hemorrhagic alterations were observed in a subset of cases. Compared to the control cohort, chronic villitis/VUE (p < 0.001), chronic deciduitis (p = 0.023), microvascular thrombosis (p = 0.003), presence of infarction areas (p = 0.047) and of accelerated villous maturation (p = 0.005) showed higher frequencies in placentas delivered by women with COVID-19. Chronic villitis/VUE (p = 0.003) and accelerated villous maturation (p = 0.019) remained statistically significant by restricting the analysis to placentas delivered after a previous cesarean section. The observed differences in terms of pathological findings could be consistent with SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, but just a subset of alterations remained statistically significant after adjusting for a previous cesarean section. A careful consideration of potential confounders is warranted in future studies exploring the relationship between COVID-19 and pregnancy.","Bertero, Luca; Borella, Fulvio; Botta, Giovanni; Carosso, Andrea; Cosma, Stefano; Bovetti, Marialuisa; Carosso, Marco; Abbona, Giancarlo; Collemi, Giammarco; Papotti, Mauro; Cassoni, Paola; Benedetto, Chiara",Virchows arch,,251
292246,Reply to letter to the editor,2020,"In 2019, Canada's gross subnational debt to GDP was well over 40%, easily the highest in the world. This level will only grow as the provinces grapple with the pandemic and its fiscal effects. Some believe surging provincial debts have brought Canadian federalism to a critical juncture: they have greatly increased the odds of federal measures to stabilize provincial finances. This note assesses this claim. The cleanest and most balanced path to fiscal sustainability is a combination of enhanced federal transfers, which would bolster provincial fiscal capacity, and national fiscal rules, which would constrain provincial borrowing. But the former is unlikely to restore sustainability on its own and the latter would require a severe provincial debt crisis, which Canada's existing fiscal federal structures can avoid. COVID-19 has increased the odds of certain reforms and it is difficult to predict their long-run effects, but any obvious path to fiscal sustainability remains closed.","Hanniman, Kyle",Can. J.

Here, we present a proof-of-concept study using multiplexed in situ hybridization (ISH) (RNAscope) to detect low-abundance cytokines in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human transplant kidney biopsies in combination with immunofluorescence (IF) for cell phenotyping. We show that a multiplex IF and ISH (mIFISH) assay is feasible to identify the cellular source of cytokines and chemokines (tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, interferon-Î³, and CXCL9) in FFPE transplant kidney biopsies and that quantification of the mRNA and protein signal is also possible at single-cell resolution in the context of tissue complexity. Furthermore, the mIFISH assay allows precise quantitative assessment of tubulitis, one of the key morphological correlates of alloimmune injury. Simultaneous in situ identification and quantification of multiple cellular phenotypes and mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines in FFPE tissues offer a novel insight into the biology of alloimmune injury in kidney transplantation and may contribute to improved diagnostic accuracy and patient care.","Junger, Henrik; Dobi, Dejan; Chen, Adeline; Lee, Linda; Vasquez, Joshua J; Tang, Qizhi; Laszik, Zoltan G",J Histochem Cytochem,,251

OBJECTIVE: Understand the impact that COVID-19 is having on the front-line clinical team in the ICU environment, as well as reveal what proposals are being made to mitigate the clinical and psychological impacts that this group experiences. METHOD: A systematic review was made following the PRISMA protocol (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis). We included any type of study on health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, with results about their mental health. We were, therefore, interested in quantitative studies examining the prevalence of problems and effects of interventions, as well as qualitative studies examining experiences. We had no restrictions related to study design, methodological quality or language. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies reported on the urgent need for interventions to prevent or reduce mental health problems caused by COVID-19 among health professionals in ICU. Eleven studies demonstrated possibilities for interventions involving organizational adjustments in the ICU, particularly linked to emotional conflicts in the fight against COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The disproportion between the need for technological supplies of intensive care medicine and their scarcity promotes, among many factors, high rates of psychological distress. Anxiety, irritability, insomnia, fear and anguish were observed during the pandemic, probably related to extremely high workloads and the lack of personal protective equipment.","da Silva, Flaviane Cristine Troglio; Barbosa, Caio Parente",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,251

296457,"Tinnitus, Hyperacusis, Otalgia, and Hearing Loss",2021,"INTRODUCTION: The recent pandemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with a lethal atypical pneumonia, making COVID-19 an urgent public health issue with an increasing rate of mortality and morbidity. There are currently no vaccines or therapeutics available for COVID-19, which is causing an urgent search for a new drug to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The lipid membrane alternation efficiency of small antimicrobial lipopeptides enables them to block viral membrane fusion to the host cell. Lipopeptides could serve as potential antiviral agents, by interacting or competing with viral fusion proteins. METHODS: This study screened seven different lipopeptides (tsushimycin, daptomycin, surfactin, bacillomycin, iturin, srfTE, and LPD-12) and docked them individually against the spike (S)-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Based on the maximum docked score and minimum atomic contact energy, LPD-12 (-1137.38 kcal) was the appropriate molecule for proper binding with the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and thus significantly interrupted its affinity of binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which is the only receptor molecule found to be facilitating disease development. The results confirmed a strong binding affinity of LPD-12 with ACE2, with a binding free energy of -1621.62 kcal, which could also reciprocally prevent the binding of S-protein. CONCLUSTION: It can be concluded that LPD-12 may act as a potential therapeutic drug, by reducing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 to the human cells via the ACE2 receptor and related infections.","Chowdhury, Trinath; Baindara, Piyush; Mandal, Santi M",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,251

297379,Successful Implicit Vocabulary Intervention for Three Cantonese-Speaking Toddlers: A Replicated Single-Case Design,2020,"The informal settlements of the Global South are the least prepared for the pandemic of COVID-19 since basic needs such as water, toilets, sewers, drainage, waste collection, and secure and adequate housing are already in short supply or non-existent. Further, space constraints, violence, and overcrowding in slums make physical distancing and self-quarantine impractical, and the rapid spread of an infection highly likely. Residents of informal settlements are also economically vulnerable during any COVID-19 responses. Any responses to COVID-19 that do not recognize these realities will further jeopardize the survival of large segments of the urban population globally. Most top-down strategies to arrest an infectious disease will likely ignore the often-robust social groups and knowledge that already exist in many slums. Here, we offer a set of practice and policy suggestions that aim to (1) dampen the spread of COVID-19 based on the latest available science, (2) improve the likelihood of medical care for the urban poor whether or not they get infected, and (3) provide economic, social, and physical improvements and protections to the urban poor, including migrants, slum communities, and their residents, that can improve their long-term well-being. Immediate measures to protect residents of urban informal settlements, the homeless, those living in precarious settlements, and the entire population from COVID-19 include the following: (1) institute informal settlements/slum emergency planning committees in every urban informal settlement; (2) apply an immediate moratorium on evictions; (3) provide an immediate guarantee of payments to the poor; (4) immediately train and deploy community health workers; (5) immediately meet Sphere Humanitarian standards for water, sanitation, and hygiene; (6) provide immediate food assistance; (7) develop and implement a solid waste collection strategy; and (8) implement immediately a plan for mobility and health care. Lessons have been learned from earlier pandemics such as HIV and epidemics such as Ebola. They can be applied here. At the same time, the opportunity exists for public health, public administration, international aid, NGOs, and community groups to innovate beyond disaster response and move toward long-term plans.","Corburn, Jason; Vlahov, David; Mberu, Blessing; Riley, Lee; Caiaffa, Waleska Teixeira; Rashid, Sabina Faiz; Ko, Albert; Patel, Sheela; Jukur, Smurti; Martínez-Herrera, Eliana; Jayasinghe, Saroj; Agarwal, Siddharth; Nguendo-Yongsi, Blaise; Weru, Jane; Ouma, Smith; Edmundo, Katia; Oni, Tolu; Ayad, Hany",J Urban Health,,251

Despite ongoing research toward the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, such a vaccine will not be available in time to contribute to the containment of the ongoing pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a framework for the rapid identification of novel targets for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. We analyzed publicly available transcriptomic datasets of SARS-CoV infected humans and mammals to identify consistent differentially expressed genes then validated in SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells transcriptomic datasets. Comprehensive toxicogenomic analysis of the identified genes to identify possible interactions with clinically proven drugs was carried out. We identified IFITM3 as an early upregulated gene, and valproic acid was found to enhance its mRNA expression as well as induce its antiviral action. These findings indicate that analysis of publicly available transcriptomic and toxicogenomic data represents a rapid approach for the identification of novel targets and molecules that can modify the action of such targets during the early phases of emerging infections like COVID-19.","Hachim, Mahmood Yaseen; Al Heialy, Saba; Hachim, Ibrahim Yaseen; Halwani, Rabih; Senok, Abiola C; Maghazachi, Azzam A; Hamid, Qutayba",Front Immunol,,251

This study described how, in the context of the early stages of the pandemic, clinicians used telemedicine for OUD in conjunction with in-person care, barriers encountered, and implications for quality of care. METHODS: In April 2020, we conducted semistructured interviews with clinicians waivered to prescribe buprenorphine. We used maximum variation sampling. We used standard qualitative analysis techniques, consisting of both inductive and deductive approaches, to identify and characterize themes. RESULTS: Eighteen clinicians representing 10 states participated. Nearly all interview participants were doing some telemedicine, and more than half were only doing telemedicine visits. Most participants reported changing their typical clinical care patterns to help patients remain at home and minimize exposure to COVID-19. Changes included waiving urine toxicology screening, sending patients home with a larger supply of OUD medications, and requiring fewer visits. Although several participants were serving new patients via telemedicine during the early weeks of the pandemic, others were not. Some clinicians identified positive impacts of telemedicine on the quality of their patient interactions, including increased access for patients. Others noted negative impacts including less structure and accountability, less information to inform clinical decision-making, challenges in establishing a connection, technological challenges, and shorter visits. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of the pandemic, buprenorphine prescribers quickly transitioned to providing telemedicine visits in high volume; nonetheless, there are still many unknowns, including the quality and safety of widespread use of telemedicine for OUD treatment.","Uscher-Pines, Lori; Sousa, Jessica; Raja, Pushpa; Mehrotra, Ateev; Barnett, Michael; Huskamp, Haiden A",J Subst Abuse Treat,,251

Given the fragility of the second wave, this chapter asks whether globalization is cyclical, sustainable only under the most propitious economic or political conditions or whether technological developments, especially the digital revolution, have changed the underlying structure of production in ways that markedly increase the cost of renationalization. Global production networks (GPNs) are discussed as an example of structural change, the emergence of a networked world economy that is both more extensive and intensive than in the past. The chapter concludes that the international economic environment will be unstable, as attempts to restore national independence and disaggregate GPNs run up against the reality of mutual dependence.

(Special Issue: Tuberculosis and COVID-19.),2020,"BackgroundThe variability of Covid-19 severity between patients has driven efforts to identify prognosticating laboratory markers that could aid clinical decision making. Procalcitonin (PCT) is classically used as a diagnostic marker in bacterial infections, but its role in predicting Covid-19 disease severity is emerging. We aimed to identify the association between PCT and Covid-19 disease severity in a critical care setting and whether bacterial co-infection is implicated.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed Covid-19 patients with PCT levels measured in a critical care setting at our institution between February and September 2020. Laboratory markers including peak PCT values and a range of bacterial culture results were analysed. Outcomes were the requirement and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation as well as inpatient mortality.ResultsIn total, 60 patients were included; 68% required invasive mechanical ventilation and 45% died as inpatient. Univariate analysis identified higher peak PCT levels significantly associated with both the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 3.2, 95% CI 1.3-9.0, p=0.02) and inpatient mortality (OR: 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.6, p=0.03). Higher peak PCT levels was an independent predictor of mortality on multivariate analysis (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.1-12.4, p=0.03). There was a significant positive correlation between increased peak PCT levels and duration on invasive mechanical ventilation. No significant difference was found between peak PCT levels of patients with positive and negative bacterial cultures. ConclusionsElevated PCT levels in Covid-19 patients are associated with respiratory failure requiring prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation and inpatient mortality. This association may be independent of bacterial co-infection.","Heer, Randeep S; Mandal, Amit K J; Kho, Jason; Szawarski, Piotr; Csabi, Peter; Grenshaw, Dawn; Walker, Ian A L; Missouris, Constantinos G",Ann Clin Biochem,,251

The relationship between post-vaccination symptoms and strength of antibody responses is unclear. ObjectiveTo determine whether adverse effects caused by vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine are associated with the magnitude of vaccine-induced antibody levels. DesignSingle center, prospective, observational cohort study. SettingParticipants worked at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and were seen monthly at the Naval Medical Research Center Clinical Trials Center. ParticipantsGenerally healthy adults that were not severely immunocompromised, had no history of COVID-19, and were seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein prior to vaccination. MeasuresSeverity of vaccine-associated symptoms was obtained through participant completed questionnaires. Testing for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and receptor binding domain was conducted using microsphere-based multiplex immunoassays. Results206 participants were evaluated (69.4% female, median age 41.5 years old). We found no correlation between vaccine-associated symptom severity scores and vaccine-induced antibody titers one month after vaccination. We also observed that 1) post-vaccination symptoms were inversely correlated with age and weight and more common in women, 2) systemic symptoms were more frequent after the second vaccination, 3) high symptom scores after first vaccination were predictive of high symptom scores after second vaccination, and 4) older age was associated with lower titers. LimitationsStudy only observes antibody responses and consists of healthy participants. ConclusionsLack of post-vaccination symptoms following receipt of the BNT162b2 vaccine does not equate to lack of vaccine-induced antibodies one month after vaccination. This study also suggests that it may be possible to design future mRNA vaccines that confer robust antibody responses with lower frequencies of vaccine-associated symptoms.

312297,The Causal Closure of Physics in Real World Contexts,2020,"The current COVID-19 pandemic poses numerous challenges for ongoing clinical trials and provides a stress-testing environment for the existing principles and practice of estimands in clinical trials. The pandemic may increase the rate of intercurrent events (ICEs) and missing values, spurring a great deal of discussion on amending protocols and statistical analysis plans to address these issues. In this article we revisit recent research on estimands and handling of missing values, especially the ICH E9 (R1) on Estimands and Sensitivity Analysis in Clinical Trials. Based on an in-depth discussion of the strategies for handling ICEs using a causal inference framework, we suggest some improvements in applying the estimand and estimation framework in ICH E9 (R1). Specifically, we discuss a mix of strategies allowing us to handle ICEs differentially based on reasons for ICEs. We also suggest ICEs should be handled primarily by hypothetical strategies and provide examples of different hypothetical strategies for different types of ICEs as well as a road map for estimation and sensitivity analyses. We conclude that the proposed framework helps streamline translating clinical objectives into targets of statistical inference and automatically resolves many issues with defining estimands and choosing estimation procedures arising from events such as the pandemic.","Qu, Yongming; Lipkovich, Ilya",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10796v1.pdf,251

The purpose of this study was to examine the lecturer's emotions towards the change they experienced with the sudden shift to online instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of those emotions on their willingness to teach online in the future. In the present study, 239 academic lecturers answered an online questionnaire. Four groups of emotions were examined: Success, opportunity, failure, and threat. The findings indicated that the emotions lecturers experienced most strongly was that of success, followed by opportunity. The predictors of lecturer's willingness to teach online in the future were emotions related to 'opportunity' and 'failure'. Surprisingly, the dramatic event of COVID-19 lockdown evoked more positive than negative emotions among lecturers during the first semester of the crisis. The emotions of threat that might characterize this period did not affect the willingness to teach online in the future as may be expected. This study demonstrates how tracing the emotional response toward adopting technology may contribute to understanding technology acceptance. It also contributes to understanding the differences in experiencing change in the normal process of technology adoption as opposed to emergency times.","Meishar-Tal, Hagit; Levenberg, Ariella",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,251

317532,The influence of early-life microbial exposures on long-term respiratory health,2021,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a public health crisis of global proportion. In psoriatic patients treated with biologic agents, evidence is not yet available on susceptibility to infection with the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and data about the perception of COVID-19 and its impact on these patients are lacking. AIMS: The aim of this observational, spontaneous study was the evaluation of the impact of anti COVID-19 measures in ""fragile population"" such as patients with a chronic inflammatory disease. Thus, we evaluated the impact of perceived risk on quality of life of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, in our outpatient clinic, and how their perceptions changed before and after the adoption of Covid-19 emergency measures following the Italian Ministerial Decree in March 9, 2020. METHODS: Using a series of questions, our study surveyed adult patients with moderate to severe psoriasis receiving treatment with biologic agents (nâ¯=â¯591), before and after the adoption of COVID-19 emergency measures. RESULTS: Most patients (97%) had been sufficiently informed by healthcare staff about COVID-19 spread. A significant change was observed in social activity reduction before and after the adoption of the measures (18% vs. 90% of patients; Pâ¯<â¯0.0001). Similarly, patients were more likely to suspend ongoing therapy after the measures were adopted than before (87% vs. 34% of patients; Pâ¯<â¯0.0001). Following the measures, older patients were significantly more inclined to suspend therapy and reduce social activities than younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: Government COVID-19 emergency measures further curtailed already reduced social activities in psoriatic patients, and led to a greater inclination to suspend biologic therapy, more so in older patients, despite there being no evidence to support this suspension. These vulnerable patients may need support from clinicians in order to maintain treatment adherence.","Bernardini, N; Skroza, N; Spagnoli, A; Marchesiello, A; Balduzzi, V; Tolino, E; Mambrin, A; Michelini, S; Maddalena, P; Volpe, S; Proietti, I; Vestri, A; Potenza, C",J Infect Public Health,,251

319229,The impact of COVID-19 on rare and complex connective tissue diseases: the experience of ERN ReCONNET,2021,"Globally, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 59 million people and killed more than 1.39 million. Designing and monitoring interventions to slow and stop the spread of the virus require knowledge of how many people have been and are currently infected, where they live, and how they interact. The first step is an accurate assessment of the population prevalence of past infections. There are very few population-representative prevalence studies of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and only two states in the United States-Indiana and Connecticut-have reported probability-based sample surveys that characterize statewide prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. One of the difficulties is the fact that tests to detect and characterize SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus antibodies are new, are not well characterized, and generally function poorly. During July 2020, a survey representing all adults in the state of Ohio in the United States collected serum samples and information on protective behavior related to SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Several features of the survey make it difficult to estimate past prevalence: 1) a low response rate; 2) a very low number of positive cases; and 3) the fact that multiple poor-quality serological tests were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We describe a Bayesian approach for analyzing the biomarker data that simultaneously addresses these challenges and characterizes the potential effect of selective response. The model does not require survey sample weights; accounts for multiple imperfect antibody test results; and characterizes uncertainty related to the sample survey and the multiple imperfect, potentially correlated tests.","Kline, David; Li, Zehang; Chu, Yue; Wakefield, Jon; Miller, William C; Norris Turner, Abigail; Clark, Samuel J",Proc.

319242,MOLECULAR DOCKING STUDY of NOVEL COVID-19 PROTEASE with CURRENT CLINICAL MANAGEMENT AGENTS,2020,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has unleashed havoc across different countries and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Since certain evidences indicate a direct relationship of various viruses with the weather (temperature in particular), the same is being speculated about COVID-19; however, it is still under investigation as the pandemic is advancing the world over. In this study, we tried to analyze the spread of COVID-19 in the Indian subcontinent with respect to the local temperature regimes from March 9, 2020, to May 27, 2020. To establish the relation between COVID-19 and temperature in India, three different ecogeographical regions having significant temperature differences were taken into consideration for the analysis. We observed that except Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Kashmir showed a significantly positive correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases and the temperature during the period of study. The evidences based on the results presented in this research lead us to believe that the increasing temperature is beneficial to the COVID-19 spread, and the cases are going to rise further with the increasing temperature over India. We, therefore, conclude that the existing data, though limited, suggest that the spread of COVID-19 in India is not explained by the variation of temperature alone and is most likely driven by a host of other factors related to epidemiology, socioeconomics and other climatic factors. Based on the results, it is suggested that temperature should not be considered as a yardstick for planning intervention strategies for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.","Meraj, Gowhar; Farooq, Majid; Singh, Suraj Kumar; Romshoo, Shakil A; Nathawat, M S; Kanga, Shruti",Environ Dev Sustain,,251

METHODS: A qualitative study using phenomenological analysis. Eight individuals participated in semi-structured interviews that focused on their experiences of decreasing PA as a result of physical distancing measures, and why they sought PA coaching to overcome these issues. Responses were analysed thematically. RESULTS: The participants reported markedly decreasing their PA following the enactment of physical distancing measures. The inability to subsequently engage in regular PA was a source of frustration for participants. Interview analysis revealed two themes that contributed to the understanding of why these individuals felt they needed PA coaching to increase PA; namely, a desire for both listening support and PA self-regulation support. CONCLUSION: The individuals who decreased PA due to COVID-19 desired an autonomy-supportive counselling style, centred on listening support and self-regulatory support. Online PA interventions were not highlighted as strategies to overcome PA barriers. Implications for public health: The effect of physical distancing measures on the determinants of overall PA is important, particularly if prolonged physical distancing is required.","Barrett, Stephen; Rodda, Kane; Begg, Stephen; O039,; Halloran, Paul D; Kingsley, Michael I",Aust N Z J Public Health,,251

327033,N-acetylcysteine as a potential treatment for COVID-19,2020,"The ongoing pandemic situation due to COVID-19 originated from the Wuhan city, China affects the world in an unprecedented scale. Unavailability of totally effective vaccination and proper treatment regimen forces to employ a non-pharmaceutical way of disease mitigation. The world is in desperate demand of useful control intervention to combat the deadly virus. This manuscript introduces a new mathematical model that addresses two different diagnosis efforts and isolation of confirmed cases. The basic reproductive number, R 0 , is inspected, and the model's dynamical characteristics are also studied. We found that with the condition R 0 < 1 , the disease can be eliminated from the system. Further, we fit our proposed model system with cumulative confirmed cases of six Indian states, namely, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Delhi and West Bengal. Sensitivity analysis carried out to scale the impact of different parameters in determining the size of the epidemic threshold of R 0 . It reveals that unidentified symptomatic cases result in an underestimation of R 0 whereas, diagnosis based on new contact made by confirmed cases can gradually reduce the size of R 0 and hence helps to mitigate the ongoing disease. An optimal control problem is framed using a control variable u ( t ) , projecting the effectiveness of diagnosis based on traced contacts made by a confirmed COVID patient. It is noticed that optimal contact tracing effort reduces R 0 effectively over time.","Kumar Das, Dhiraj; Khatua, Anupam; Kar, T K; Jana, Soovoojeet",Appl Math Comput,,251

328080,Comorbidities factors and hypertension in relation to COVID-19,2021,"Most ethics guidelines for distributing scarce medical resources during the coronavirus pandemic seek to save the most lives and the most life-years. A patient's prognosis is determined using a SOFA or MSOFA score to measure likelihood of survival to discharge, as well as a consideration of relevant comorbidities and their effects on likelihood of survival up to one or five years. Although some guidelines use age as a tiebreaker when two patients' prognoses are identical, others refuse to consider age for fear of discriminating against the elderly. In this paper, I argue that age is directly relevant for maximizing health benefits, so current ethics guidelines are wrongly excluding or deemphasizing life-stage in their triage algorithms. Research on COVID-19 has shown that age is a risk factor in adverse outcomes, independent of comorbidities. And limiting a consideration of life-years to only one or five years past discharge does not maximize health benefits. Therefore, based on their own stated values, triage algorithms for coronavirus patients ought to include life-stage as a primary consideration, along with the SOFA score and comorbidities, rather than excluding it or using it merely as a tiebreaker. This is not discriminatory because patients ought to have equal opportunity to experience life-stages. The equitable enforcement of that right justifies unequal treatment based on age in cases when there is a scarcity of life-saving resources. A consideration of life-stage would thus allow healthcare workers to responsibly steward public resources in order to maximize lives and life-years saved.","Altman, Matthew C",Bioethics,,251

329052,Beyond the Rubble of Lake Street - Minds in Crisis in a City in Crisis,2021,"COVID-19 has become a serious health problem all around the world. It is confirmed that this virus has taken over 126,607 lives until today. Since the beginning of its spreading, many Artificial Intelligence researchers developed systems and methods for predicting the virus's behavior or detecting the infection. One of the possible ways of determining the patient infection to COVID-19 is through analyzing the chest X-ray images. As there are a large number of patients in hospitals, it would be time-consuming and difficult to examine lots of X-ray images, so it can be very useful to develop an AI network that does this job automatically. In this paper, we have trained several deep convolutional networks with the introduced training techniques for classifying X-ray images into three classes: normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19, based on two open-source datasets. Unfortunately, most of the previous works on this subject have not shared their dataset, and we had to deal with few data on covid19 cases. Our data contains 180 X-ray images that belong to persons infected to COVID-19, so we tried to apply methods to achieve the best possible results. In this research, we introduce some training techniques that help the network learn better when we have few cases of COVID-19, and also we propose a neural network that is a concatenation of Xception and ResNet50V2 networks. This network achieved the best accuracy by utilizing multiple features extracted by two robust networks. In this paper, despite some other researches, we have tested our network on 11302 images to report the actual accuracy our network can achieve in real circumstances. The average accuracy of the proposed network for detecting COVID-19 cases is 99.56%, and the overall average accuracy for all classes is 91.4%.","Rahimzadeh, Mohammad; Attar, Abolfazl",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08052v1.pdf,251

It is vital to understand what is causing this: worries over potential adversities due to the pandemic, or the toll of experiencing adverse events. METHODS: We used panel data from 41 909 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study assessed weekly from 1 April 2020 to 12 May 2020 to study the association between adversities and anxiety and depressive symptoms. We studied six categories of adversity including both worries and experiences of: illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety. Anxiety and depression were measured using the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. We used fixed-effect regression models to account for time-invariant confounders. RESULTS: Cumulative number of worries and experience of adversities were both related to higher levels of anxiety and depression. A number of worries were associated more with anxiety than depression, but number of experiences were equally related to anxiety and depression. There were clear associations between specific worries and poorer mental health. There was weak evidence that individuals of lower socio-economic position were more negatively affected psychologically by the adverse experiences. CONCLUSION: Measures over the first few weeks of lockdown in the UK appear to have been insufficient at reassuring people given that we see clear associations with mental health and cumulative worries. Interventions are required that seek to prevent adverse events (eg, redundancies) and reassure individuals and support adaptive coping strategies.","Wright, Liam; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,251

MERS-CoV infection consequences with either hospitalization or death. Methods: All positive MERS-CoV cases that diagnosed in and reported to a referral hospital in Najran, KSA from March/2014 to December/2018 were revised retrospectively. We identified patients from infection control department and medical records. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were collected. Results: Of the 54 positive MERS-CoV cases, 3 cases were excluded because no available data. Therefore, the final number of the included cases in the study was 51 cases (94.4). Most of the patients were Saudi 36 (70.6%), and majority of cases were reported in the winter 18 (35.3) season. Fever 47 (92.2%), cough 44 (86.3%), and shortness of breath 37 (72.5%) were reported as most common symptoms. Most patients had diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Overall mortality rate was 37.3%, and interestingly the mortality rate dropped sharply over 5 years. In logistic regression analysis, Season and Chronic Kidney disease patients were the only two variables statistically significantly associated with death. The odds of death the patients infected by MERS-CoV during Autumn and Winter season were 4.09 times higher than those patients who infected during Spring and Summer season (OR = 4.09, CI 1.18-14.15, P < 0.026). Compared with MERS-CoV patients who had Non-Chronic kidney diseases, the odds of death the MERS-CoV patients who had chronic kidney diseases were 18.08 times higher (OR = 18.08, CI -2.01-162.99, P < 0.01). Conclusion: The case fatality rate of MERS-CoV infection was high. Further studies with large sample sizes are needed to explore the reasons behind the decrease in the mortality rate over the time period.","Al Sulayyim, Hadi J; Khorshid, Sherif M; Al Moummar, Satam H",J Infect Public Health,,251
335793,Achieving vaccine for COVID-19: Hope for AIDS and hepatitis C Vaccine?,2021,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, intraneuronal deposition of misfolded proteins known as Lewy bodies, and chronic neuroinflammation. PD can arise from monogenic mutations, but in most cases, the etiology is unclear. Viral infection is gaining increasing attentions as a trigger of PD. In this study, we investigated whether the PD-causative 620 aspartate (D) to asparagine (N) mutation in the vacuolar protein sorting 35 ortholog (Vps35) precipitated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. We observed that ectopic expression of Vps35 significantly reduced the proliferation and release of HSV-1 virions; the D620N mutation rendered Vps35 a partial loss of such inhibitory effects. Tetherin is a host cell protein capable of restricting the spread of encapsulated viruses including HSV-1 and SARS-Cov-2, both of which are implicated in the development of parkinsonism. Compared with cells overexpressing wildtype Vps35, cells expressing mutant Vps35 with D620N had less Tetherin on cell surfaces. Real-time and static cell imaging revealed that Tetherin recycled through Vps35-positive endosomes. Expression of Vps35 with D620N reduced endosomal dynamics and frequency of motile Tetherin-containing vesicles, a sign of defective production of recycling carriers. Our study suggests that the D620N mutation in Vps35 hinders Tetherin trafficking to cell surfaces and facilitates virus spread.","Ding, Yingzhuo; Li, Yan; Chhetri, Gaurav; Peng, Xiaoxin; Wu, Jing; Wang, Zejian; Zhao, Bo; Zhao, Wenjuan; Li, Xueyi",,,251

336312,COVID-19 vaccine development from the perspective of cancer patients,2021,"The genome of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, encodes for two proteases, a papain like (PLpro ) protease and the so-called main protease (Mpro ), a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease, also named 3CLpro or non-structural protein 5 (nsp5). Mpro is activated by autoproteolysis and is the main protease responsible for cutting the viral polyprotein into functional units. Aside from this, it is described that Mpro proteases are also capable of processing host proteins, including those involved in the host innate immune response. To identify substrates of the three main proteases from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and hCoV-NL63 coronviruses, an LC-MS based N-terminomics in vitro analysis is performed using recombinantly expressed proteases and lung epithelial and endothelial cell lysates as substrate pools. For SARS-CoV-2 Mpro , 445 cleavage events from more than 300 proteins are identified, while 151 and 331 Mpro derived cleavage events are identified for SARS-CoV and hCoV-NL63, respectively. These data enable to better understand the cleavage site specificity of the viral proteases and will help to identify novel substrates in vivo. All data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD021406.","Koudelka, Tomas; Boger, Juliane; Henkel, Alessandra; Schönherr, Robert; Krantz, Stefanie; Fuchs, Sabine; Rodríguez, Estefanía; Redecke, Lars; Tholey, Andreas",Proteomics,,251

Fear of needle was assessed using a single-item self-report global question, anxiety was assessed using the Likert scale (score 1-5) and the standardized ""Children Faces Scale"" where facial responses were graded from 0 to 4. Out of a total sample of 2568 school children, 1225 (47.7%) reported needle fear (95% CI: 45.8%-49.6%) on a global single item assessment. On an anxiety related Likert scale, 52.3% did not respond (mainly younger children) and among those who responded, 42.6% (523/1226) showed significant anxiety (score of &#8805;3 on Likert scale of 1 to 5). Finally, 17.4% children (95% CI: 15.9%-18.9%) (n = 446/2568) scored 2 or above (indicating significant needle fear) on the 'Children Faces Scale' during the actual vaccination procedure. The needle fear were significantly increased among girl students as compared to boys (adjusted OR 2.58; 95% CI: 2.05-3.24, p < 0.001) as well as children accompanied by their parents (adjusted OR 2.05; 95% CI:1.57-2.69, p < 0.001). On the other hand, needle fear was significantly lowered in children studying in private schools as compared to public school children (adjusted OR 0.45; 95% CI: 0.28-0.74, p = 0.002). The needle fear, which was an overriding concern in the minds of girls, children accompanied by their parents, and public-school students, must be proactively addressed for successful mass vaccination campaigns.

The present study investigated important predictors in determining the satisfaction of undergraduate students (N = 425) from multiple departments in using ERL at a self-funded university in Hong Kong while Moodle and Microsoft Team are the key learning tools. By comparing the predictive accuracy between multiple regression and machine learning models before and after the use of random forest recursive feature elimination, all multiple regression, and machine learning models showed improved accuracy while the most accurate model was the elastic net regression with 65.2% explained variance. The results show only neutral (4.11 on a 7-point Likert scale) regarding the overall satisfaction score on ERL. Even majority of students are competent in technology and have no obvious issue in accessing learning devices or Wi-Fi, face-to-face learning is more preferable compared to ERL and this is found to be the most important predictor. Besides, the level of efforts made by instructors, the agreement on the appropriateness of the adjusted assessment methods, and the perception of online learning being well delivered are shown to be highly important in determining the satisfaction scores. The results suggest that the need of reviewing the quality and quantity of modified assessment accommodated for ERL and structured class delivery with the suitable amount of interactive learning according to the learning culture and program nature.","Ho, Indy Man Kit; Cheong, Kai Yuen; Weldon, Anthony",PLoS One,,251

This cross-sectional study sought to analyze the mental health outcomes of SGM young people (18-30 years) during the early stages of the pandemic in the United States (April 13-June 18, 2020) and to explore how factors related to SGM identity impact mental health, such as lifetime discrimination, family support, and pre-existing mental health conditions. An online survey collected socio-demographic information and assessed for both mental health (depression (PHQ-8), anxiety (GAD-7), PTSD (PCL-C)) and COVID-19-related outcomes (COVID-19-related worries and COVID-19-related grief). Out of 981 participants, 320 (32.6%) identified as SGM. SGM had significantly higher levels of depression and PTSD symptoms as well as COVID-19-related worries and grief than non-SGM, even after controlling for family support, lifetime discrimination, and pre-existing mental health diagnoses. These findings suggest that not only has the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted SGM mental health, but that minority stress factors cannot fully explain this impact. Thus, clinicians and societal stakeholders (schools, employers, policymakers) must think beyond traditional minority stress factors (family support, discrimination) and pre-pandemic disparities to support this vulnerable population as the pandemic progresses.","Kamal, Kanika; Li, Jason J; Hahm, Hyeouk Chris; Liu, Cindy H",Psychiatry Res,,251

345111,Precision therapeutic targets for COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 occurs within the first weeks after COVID-19. Those antibodies exert a neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2, whose evolution overtime after COVID-19 as well as efficiency against novel variants are however poorly characterized. METHODS: In this prospective study, sera of 107 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were collected at 3- and 6-months post-infection. We performed quantitative neutralization experiments on top of high-throughput serological assays evaluating anti-Spike (S) and anti-Nucleocapsid (NP) IgG. FINDINGS: Levels of sero-neutralization and IgG rates against the ancestral strain decreased significantly over time. After 6 months, 2.8% of the patients had a negative serological status for both anti-S and anti-NP IgG. However, all sera had a persistent and effective neutralizing effect against SARS-CoV-2. IgG levels correlated with sero-neutralization and this correlation was stronger for anti-S than for anti-NP antibodies. The level of sero-neutralization quantified at 6 months correlated with markers of initial severity, notably admission in intensive care units and the need for mechanical invasive ventilation. In addition, sera collected at 6 months were tested against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and showed efficient neutralizing effects against D614G, B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants but a significantly weaker activity against B.1.351 variant. INTERPRETATION: Decrease of IgG rates and serological assays becoming negative did not imply loss of neutralizing capacity. Our results indicate a sustained humoral response against the ancestral strain and the D614G, B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants for at least 6 months in patients previously hospitalized for COVID-19. A weaker protection was however observed for the B.1.351 variant.","Betton, Maureen; Livrozet, Marine; Planas, Delphine; Fayol, Antoine; Monel, Blandine; Védie, Benoit; Bruel, Timothée; Tartour, Eric; Robillard, Nicolas; Manuguerra, Jean-Claude; Blanchard, Anne; Ghosn, Jade; Visseaux, Benoit; Péré, Hélène; Lebeaux, David; Schwartz, Olivier; Veyer, David; Hulot, Jean-Sébastien",Clin. infect. dis,,251

This paper proposes a robust deep Gaussian processes (DGP)-based probabilistic load forecasting method using a limited number of data. Since the proposed method only requires a limited number of training samples for load forecasting, it allows us to deal with extreme scenarios that cause short-term load behavior changes. In particular, the load forecasting at the beginning of abnormal event is cast as a regression problem with limited training samples and solved by double stochastic variational inference DGP. The mobility data are also utilized to deal with the uncertainties and pattern changes and enhance the flexibility of the forecasting model. The proposed method can quantify the uncertainties of load forecasting outcomes, which would be essential under uncertain inputs. Extensive comparison results with other state-of-the-art point and probabilistic forecasting methods show that our proposed approach can achieve high forecasting accuracies with only a limited number of data while maintaining excellent performance of capturing the forecasting uncertainties.

346260,Impact of non-pharmacological initiatives for COVID-19 on hospital admissions due to pediatric acute respiratory illnesses,2021,"Introduction: In the wake of both the unprecedented nationwide ban on elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemicand the increased mortality of otolaryngologists and neurosurgeons during this same time period, concern regarding thetiming and safety of neurosurgical intervention for sellar-based pathology has been raised within both the neurosurgical andotolaryngology communities. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who underwent operative intervention for sellar-basedpathology from March 12 to July 1 for both 2019 and 2020. Dates were chosen to align with the Virginia State ofEmergency on March 12 and the multiphase reopening of the public which lasted until July 1. Primary endpoints studied forcomparison included case volume, median time to surgery, and COVID-related mortality. Results: In total, a 26.6% decrease in overall surgical case volume occurred in comparison to the previous year. Astatistically significant decrease in frequency of endonasal surgery was seen from 20 in 2019 to 6 in 2020 ( p = 0.04). Whilemedian time to surgery for pituitary adenomas was unchanged from the previous year (26 days), this data does not takeinto account six patients who electively postponed treatment due to fear of receiving medical care during the pandemic.Among 2,795 COVID-19 patients treated in our institution, only one patient had a pituitary tumor. Here, treatment wasdelayed by 81 days. For emergent cases, such as pituitary apoplexy, surgeons increased utilization of the microscope as ameans to reduce the number of personnel exposed. Finally, our practice had no COVID-related mortality for patientsundergoing sellar-based surgery. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic did not delay time to treatment for emergent presentations of vision loss or pituitaryapoplexy. In these instances, our department followed strict institutional policy regarding use of proper PPE, as well asminimization of hospital personnel exposure. On an outpatient basis, the pandemic did cause a noticeable delay in time totreatment;however, patients' outcomes were unaffected. Close patient monitoring was achieved via utilization oftelemedicine to trend hormone levels and assess development of related symptoms. Finally, decreases in overall casevolume are likely due to ongoing cultural avoidance of seeking medical care, while deferment of endonasal surgery may beattributed to a concern for greater mortality for endonasal procedures.","Mugge, L.; Dang, D.; Awan, O.; Gunnells, E.; Vaughan, M.; Ziu, M.; Singh, A.; Vyas, N.",Journal of Neurological Surgery Part B: Skull Base,,251

348459,Advances in the diagnosis of tuberculosis- Journey from smear microscopy to whole genome sequencing,2020,"The article set out to discuss the digital divide and its implications for the right to the city, considering the perspective of smart cities. Since the main innovative aspect related to smart cities is the mediation of urban management and urban life through the use of ICTs. The debate was conducted taking as examples both remote learning initiatives and access to the federal government's emergency in the context of the COVID-19 pandemics - two ICTs mediated services that illustrate how the digital divide affects the availability of these services in a digital way. Such choice was made because exclusion is not a recent phenomenon, but it has become more evident due to the need for social isolation. The analysis of the chosen examples was made by examining bibliographic material and news media. The main conclusion is that in scenarios such as Brazil's, with strong and historical inequality, the use of ICTs for mediation of rights, including the right to the city, may end up reproducing processes of social exclusion, now re-signified in digital exclusion in the context of smart cities. In this sense, it is understood that for digital solutions and services implemented in cities to actually contribute to improving the living conditions of their residents, digital inclusion must be seen as a right, guaranteeing access and knowledge about such technologies and access infrastructure.","Muniz, C.

348807,Supplementary medicines and antioxidants in viral infections: A review of proposed effects for COVID-19,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents a significant threat to human health. Despite its similarity to related coronaviruses, there are currently no specific treatments for COVID-19 infection, and therefore there is an urgent need to develop therapies for this and future coronavirus outbreaks. Formation of the cap at the 5' end of viral RNA has been shown to help coronaviruses evade host defenses. Nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) is responsible for N7-methylation of the cap guanosine in coronaviruses. This enzyme is highly conserved among coronaviruses and is a bifunctional protein with both N7-methyltransferase and 3'-5' exonuclease activities that distinguish nsp14 from its human equivalent. Mutational analysis of SARS-CoV nsp14 highlighted its role in viral replication and translation efficiency of the viral genome. In this paper, we describe the characterization and development of a high-throughput assay for nsp14 utilizing RapidFire technology. The assay has been used to screen a library of 1771 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. From this, we have validated nitazoxanide as a selective inhibitor of the methyltransferase activity of nsp14. Although modestly active, this compound could serve as a starting point for further optimization.","Pearson, Lesley-Anne; Green, Charlotte J; Lin, De; Petit, Alain-Pierre; Gray, David W; Cowling, Victoria H; Fordyce, Euan A F",SLAS Discov,,251

To assess the risk, severity and duration of COVID-19 in relation to access to PPE in at-risk healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: From 17 July to 25 September 2020, at-risk physicians and nurses registered as a provider in the Survey Healthcare Globus network in six countries (the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and USA) were identified based on adult medical specialties with frequent and close contact with patients with COVID-19. Exposed HCWs completed a detailed questionnaire including demographics, medical, social and lifestyle factors. COVID-19 cases were defined as COVID-19 symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, loss of taste or smell) and asymptomatic COVID-19 test positive cases. RESULTS: Among 2884 exposed HCWs (94% medical doctors and 6% nurses or physician assistants), there were 514 reports of COVID-19 illness and 54 asymptomatic COVID-19 test positive cases. COVID-19 risk was significantly associated with close contact with COVID-19 cases both inside and outside the workplace, number of work shifts and hours worked per week. Limited access to PPE compared with access to a fresh mask, gown and gloves and face shield with each patient encounter was associated with a 2.2-fold to 22-fold increased risk of reporting COVID-19 symptoms (p<0.0001), a pattern consistent across all six countries. Further, limited access to PPE was associated with symptom duration greater than 2 weeks and the presence of moderate to severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing, abnormal chest X-ray, low oxygen saturations, respiratory distress and acute lung injury. CONCLUSION: In six countries, less access to PPE was strongly associated with both increased risk of reporting COVID-19 illness as well as more prolonged and severe disease course in frontline HCWs.","Kim, Hyunju; Hegde, Sheila; LaFiura, Christine; Raghavan, Madhunika; Sun, Nancy; Cheng, Susan; Rebholz, Casey M; Seidelmann, Sara B",,,251
351307,From Other Journals: A Review of Recent Articles in Pediatric Cardiology,2020,"An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in December 2019 became a major global concern in 2020. Since then, several articles analyzing the course, complications and mechanisms of the infection have appeared. However, there are very few papers explaining the possible correlations between COVID-19, atherosclerosis and acute coronary syndromes. We performed an analysis of PubMed, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and MEDLINE databases. As of September 15, 2020, the results were as follows: for ""COVID-19"" and ""cardiovascular system"" we obtained 687 results; for ""COVID-19"" and ""myocardial infarction"" together with ""COVID-19"" and ""acute coronary syndrome"" we obtained 328 results; for ""COVID-19"" and ""atherosclerosis"" we obtained 57 results. Some of them did not fulfill the search criteria or concerned the field of neurology. Only articles written in English, German and Polish were analyzed for a total number of 432 papers. While the link between inflammatory response, COVID- 19 and atherosclerosis still remains unclear, there is evidence that suggests a more likely correlation between them. Practitioners' efforts should be focused on the prevention of excessive inflammatory response and possible complications, while there are limited specific therapeutic options against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, special attention should be paid to cardioprotection during the pandemic.","Grzegorowska, Oliwia; Lorkowski, Jacek",,,251

The main objective of this survey was to investigate the initial experiences of neurologists with the use of telemedicine for different neurological conditions during the first phase of the COVID-19. METHODS: All hospital-based neurologists in Norway (n = 400) were invited to a questionnaire survey by e-mail in April 2020. The study focused on telemedicine and all questions were answered with regard to the first weeks of the pandemic lockdown in Norway. RESULTS: One-hundred and thirty-five neurologists responded. Overall, 87% reported a shift toward more telemedicine, with significantly more use of telephone than video consultations for both new referrals (54% vs. 30%, P < 0.001) and follow-ups (99% vs. 50%, P < 0.001). Respondents deemed it much more professionally satisfactory to conduct follow-up consultations by telephone, than to carry out consultations with new patients by telephone (85% vs. 13%, P < 0.001). Teleconsultations were better suited for headache and epilepsy patients as compared to multiple sclerosis and movement disorder patients. There was no significant difference between residents and senior consultants regarding how they experienced teleconsultations. Female neurologists found telemedicine better and more effective than male neurologists. INTERPRETATION: Telemedicine was rapidly implemented in Norwegian neurological departments during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Patients seeking abortion care and those pursuing preventive reproductive health care describe many of the same psychosocial, interpersonal, and structural barriers to obtaining care 1,2 Notable psychosocial challenges to obtaining care include medical mistrust and not prioritizing one's personal health amid competing demands;interpersonal barriers include parenting and caregiving for adult family members;and structural barriers include instability around insurance, transportation, and childcare 1 Although many barriers to seeking abortion and preventive reproductive health care coincide, those seeking abortion care face additional challenges, including stigma and antiabortion legal restrictions The Turnaway Study was a landmark five-year longitudinal study that followed individuals who presented for abortion just before or after the gestational age limits at 30 abortion clinics across the United States 2 Participants who presented after the clinics' gestational age limits and were unable to obtain a desired abortion were more likely to experience economic hardship and report being in fair or poor health years later, compared with those who presented in time to obtain their desired abortion 2,3 Furthermore, what is often called the ""wellwoman visit,"" which we refer to as the ""preventive reproductive health visit"" in recognition that not all individuals assigned female at birth identify as women, is an important opportunity to provide health screening, counseling, immunizations, contraception, and preconception care to help address individual and population-level reproductive health disparities 1 INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO OVERCOMING BARRIERS Given the myriad interacting barriers individuals face in obtaining reproductive health care, innovative strategies to engage people in reproductive health care must prioritize meeting people where they are, figuratively and sometimes literally, to help them overcome their own context-specific barriers [ ]they implemented a program offering colocation of contraceptive services to mothers presenting for their young infants' well-baby visits Importantly, preventive reproductive health care offers many potential health benefits but remains a downstream intervention that cannot fully mitigate long-standing, underlying structural and environmental factors that negatively affect individuals' reproductive health and contribute to population-level reproductive health disparities","Chor, Julie M.

Given the collapse of hospital care in Manaus in January 2021 and the results of three recent preprints, each that reports increased transmissibility of the P.1 variant, we propose some urgent measures. Genomic surveillance based on multi-step diagnostics, starting with RT-PCR type tests and up to sequencing, should be established. Efforts to identify reinfections associated with this variant and the update of its definition in protocols should be prioritized, and studies on the efficacy of currently available vaccines in Brazil concerning the new variant should be conducted. We also propose improving the Brazilian health surveillance system such that genomic surveillance is coordinated and thereby better able to respond to future emergencies in a more timely fashion. We call on the public agents involved in health surveillance to share data and information regarding the epidemic in a clear, fast and transparent way. Finally, we propose a greater engagement in inter-institutional cooperation of all those involved in the response and production of knowledge about the pandemic in our country.","Marquitti, Flavia Maria Darcie; Coutinho, Renato Mendes; Ferreira, Leonardo Souto; Borges, Marcelo Eduardo; Portella, Tatiana Pineda; Silva, Rafael Lopes Paixão da; Canton, Otavio; Poloni, Silas; Franco, Caroline; Coelho, Verônica; Barberia, Lorena; Bolle, Monica de; Boing, Alexandra Crispim; Donalisio, Maria Rita; Boing, Antonio Fernando; Silva, Antônio Augusto Moura da; Prado, Paulo Inácio; Veras, Maria Amélia de Sousa Mascena; Kraenkel, Roberto André",Rev. bras. epidemiol,,251

It is a challenge to implement timely and appropriate public health interventions. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Population and COVID-19 epidemiological data between 21st January 2020 to 15th November 2020 from 216 countries and territories were included with the implemented public health interventions. We used deep reinforcement learning, and the algorithm was trained to enable agents to try to find optimal public health strategies that maximized total reward on controlling the spread of COVID-19. The results suggested by the algorithm were analyzed against the actual timing and intensity of lockdown and travel restrictions. Early implementations of the actual lockdown and travel restriction policies, usually at the time of local index case were associated with less burden of COVID-19. In contrast, our agent suggested to initiate at least minimal intensity of lockdown or travel restriction even before or on the day of the index case in each country and territory. In addition, the agent mostly recommended a combination of lockdown and travel restrictions and higher intensity policies than the policies implemented by governments, but did not always encourage rapid full lockdown and full border closures. The limitation of this study was that it was done with incomplete data due to the emerging COVID-19 epidemic, inconsistent testing and reporting. In addition, our research focuses only on population health benefits by controlling the spread of COVID-19 without balancing the negative impacts of economic and social consequences. INTERPRETATION: Compared to actual government implementation, our algorithm mostly recommended earlier intensity of lockdown and travel restrictions. Reinforcement learning may be used as a decision support tool for implementation of public health interventions during COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Kwak, Gloria Hyunjung; Ling, Lowell; Hui, Pan",PLoS One,,251

357784,Management of COVID-19: current status and future prospects,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to respiratory failure due to severe immune response. Treatment targeting this immune response might be beneficial but there is limited evidence on its efficacy. The aim of this study was to determine if early treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with tocilizumab and/or steroids was associated with better outcome. METHODS: This observational single-center study included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were not intubated and received either standard of care (SOC, controls) or SOC plus early (within 3 days from hospital admission) anti-inflammatory treatment. SOC consisted of hydroxychloroquine 400mg bid plus, in those admitted before March 24th, also darunavir/ritonavir. Anti-inflammatory treatment consisted of either tocilizumab (8mg/kg intravenously or 162mg subcutaneously) or methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg for 5 days or both. Failure was defined as intubation or death, and the endpoints were failure-free survival (primary endpoint) and overall survival (secondary) at day 30. Difference between the groups was estimated as Hazard Ratio by a propensity score weighted Cox regression analysis (HROW). RESULTS: Overall, 196 adults were included in the analyses. They were mainly male (67.4%), with comorbidities (78.1%) and severe COVID-19 pneumonia (83.7%). Median age was 67.9 years (range, 30-100) and median PaO2/FiO2 200 mmHg (IQR 133-289). Among them, 130 received early anti-inflammatory treatment with: tocilizumab (n = 29, 22.3%), methylprednisolone (n = 45, 34.6%), or both (n = 56, 43.1%). The adjusted failure-free survival among tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC treated patients vs. SOC was 80.8% (95%CI, 72.8-86.7) vs. 64.1% (95%CI, 51.3-74.0), HROW 0.48, 95%CI, 0.23-0.99; p = 0.049. The overall survival among tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC patients vs. SOC was 85.9% (95%CI, 80.7-92.6) vs. 71.9% (95%CI, 46-73), HROW 0.41, 95%CI: 0.19-0.89, p = 0.025. CONCLUSION: Early adjunctive treatment with tocilizumab, methylprednisolone or both may improve outcomes in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Mikulska, Malgorzata; Nicolini, Laura Ambra; Signori, Alessio; Di Biagio, Antonio; Sepulcri, Chiara; Russo, Chiara; Dettori, Silvia; Berruti, Marco; Sormani, Maria Pia; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Vena, Antonio; De Maria, Andrea; Dentone, Chiara; Taramasso, Lucia; Mirabella, Michele; Magnasco, Laura; Mora, Sara; Delfino, Emanuele; Toscanini, Federica; Balletto, Elisa; Alessandrini, Anna Ida; Baldi, Federico; Briano, Federica; Camera, Marco; Dodi, Ferdinando; Ferrazin, Antonio; Labate, Laura; Mazzarello, Giovanni; Pincino, Rachele; Portunato, Federica; Tutino, Stefania; Barisione, Emanuela; Bruzzone, Bianca; Orsi, Andrea; Schenone, Eva; Rosseti, Nirmala; Sasso, Elisabetta; Da Rin, Giorgio; Pelosi, Paolo; Beltramini, Sabrina; Giacomini, Mauro; Icardi, Giancarlo; Gratarola, Angelo; Bassetti, Matteo",PLoS One,,251

To evaluate the impact of vaccines on the chicken immune system, 2 animal trials were performed in specific pathogen-free broiler chickens. In trial 1, birds were either vaccinated when they are one-day old with a dual recombinant herpes virus of turkey construct vaccine, expressing VP2 protein of (IBDV) and F protein of Newcastle disease virus, or an immune-complex IBDV vaccine or birds were not vaccinated. At 14, 28, and 35 D, the bursa of Fabricius was collected for bursa:body weight (B:BW) ratio calculation. In trial 2, birds were vaccinated when they were 1-day old according to the same protocol as trial 1, but at day 14, all groups also received a live infectious bronchitis (IB) vaccine. At 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after IB vaccination, birds were tested by ELISA for IB serology and, soon after the last blood sampling, they were euthanized for collection of Harderian glands, trachea, and spleen and testing by flow cytometry for characterization of mononuclear cells. The immune-complex vaccine groups showed significantly lower B:BW ratio, lower IBV antibody titers, and higher mean percentage of CD8+ T cells in the spleen, trachea, and Harderian glands than those in the other experimental groups. The results of the in vivo trials coupled with a depth analysis of the repertoire of parameters involved in the immune response to IBD and IB vaccinations show one vaccine may influence the immune response of other vaccines included in the vaccination program.","Lupini, Caterina; Quaglia, Giulia; Mescolini, Giulia; Russo, Elisa; Salaroli, Roberta; Forni, Monica; Boldini, Sara; Catelli, Elena",Poult Sci,,251

In Spain, the effect has evolved from being anecdotal in January 2020 to become the second country in Europe with the highest number of cases (614,000 cases by 17/09/2020), which has affected the health system and caused major mobility restrictions. In contrast, COVID-19 has affected air pollution and energy consumption in the country. This article analyzes the indirect effect produced by this pandemic on air pollution, referenced to various stages that occurred in Spain: first stage, without public awareness of COVID-19 impact (mid-January 2020); second is when Spanish Government alerted (late February 2020); and third, after the decree of alarm and mobility restriction of citizens by the government (March 2020) along with the various phases of the de-escalation. The indirect effect produced by this pandemic on air pollution in Spanish cities has been resulted in a decrement of 70% to 80% of average, taking into account dates after the decree of alarm and mobility restriction by the Spanish government (14/03/2020), compared to days prior to that date. Thus, the results of this analysis indicate a significant alteration in air pollutants; these alteration patterns have followed similar paths over different countries worldwide improving the air quality as discussed by Dutheil et al.

A 'closed-off management' protocol has been launched nationwide in China to cope with this major public health emergency. However, these procedures may cause a crisis for blood donation and blood supply. In this study, we assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood donation and supply in Zhejiang province, which could provide reference and insight for developing countermeasures in other countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood donor and supply information from 38 blood centres during the Spring Festival of 2019 and 2020 were reviewed. A self-administered questionnaire was carried out. RESULTS: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of whole blood donors dropped by 67%. The success rate of recruitment for donations dropped by 60%. Most respondents (81·2%) were worried about the 'possibility of acquiring COVID-19 during blood donation'. The total amount of RBCs supply dropped by 65%. In the first week of the outbreak, the weekly amount of issued RBC units (10171·5 u) was almost six times higher than the collected units (1347·5 u). The mean haemoglobin value for RBCs transfusion was about 6·3 g/dl. About 4% of RBCs and 2·8% of frozen plasma were used in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The secondary consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are blood shortages caused by the unavailability of blood donors, and this is likely to be replicated in many countries with high burdens of COVID-19. Practical actions to broaden sources and reduce use for the global crisis must be taken proactively.","Wang, Yongjun; Han, Wenjuan; Pan, Lingling; Wang, Cuier; Liu, Yan; Hu, Wei; Zhou, Huapin; Zheng, Xiaofan",Vox Sang,,251
360311,Implementing a Remote Work Program for Cancer Registrars,2021,"Infrared thermography for camera-based skin temperature measurement is increasingly used in medical practice, e.g., to detect fevers and infections, such as recently in the COVID-19 pandemic. This contactless method is a promising technology to continuously monitor the vital signs of patients in clinical environments. In this study, we investigated both skin temperature trend measurement and the extraction of respiration-related chest movements to determine the respiratory rate using low-cost hardware in combination with advanced algorithms. In addition, the frequency of medical examinations or visits to the patients was extracted. We implemented a deep learning-based algorithm for real-time vital sign extraction from thermography images. A clinical trial was conducted to record data from patients on an intensive care unit. The YOLOv4-Tiny object detector was applied to extract image regions containing vital signs (head and chest). The infrared frames were manually labeled for evaluation. Validation was performed on a hold-out test dataset of 6 patients and revealed good detector performance (0.75 intersection over union, 0.94 mean average precision). An optical flow algorithm was used to extract the respiratory rate from the chest region. The results show a mean absolute error of 2.69 bpm. We observed a computational performance of 47 fps on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX module for YOLOv4-Tiny, which proves real-time capability on an embedded GPU system. In conclusion, the proposed method can perform real-time vital sign extraction on a low-cost system-on-module and may thus be a useful method for future contactless vital sign measurements.","Lyra, Simon; Mayer, Leon; Ou, Liyang; Chen, David; Timms, Paddy; Tay, Andrew; Chan, Peter Y; Ganse, Bergita; Leonhardt, Steffen; Hoog Antink, Christoph",Sensors (Basel),,251

As such, robust monitoring of the impact of the health crisis and containment measures across agricultural value chains will likely prove vitally important. With Bangladesh as a case study, we discuss the building blocks of a comprehensive monitoring system for prioritizing and designing interventions that respond to food system disruptions from COVID-19 and preemptively avoid further cascading negative effects. We also highlight the need for parallel research that identifies pathways for enhancing information flow, analysis, and action to improve the efficiency and reliability of input and output value chains. In aggregate, this preliminary work highlights the building blocks of resilient food systems to external shocks such as COVID-19 pandemic in the context of developing nations. In doing so, we call attention to the importance of 'infection safe' agricultural input and output distribution logistics, extended social safety nets, adequate credit facilities, and innovative labor management tools alongside, appropriate farm mechanization. In addition, digital extension services, circular nutrient flows, enhanced storage facilities, as well as innovative and robust marketing mechanisms are required.

This study takes a computational approach to more deeply comprehend this change. Using a unique data set of all the campaigns published over the past two years on GoFundMe, we explore the factors that have led to the successful funding of a crowdfunding project. In particular, we study a corpus of crowdfunded projects, analyzing cover images and other variables commonly present on crowdfunding sites. Furthermore, we construct a classifier and a regression model to assess the significance of features based on XGBoost. In addition, we employ counterfactual analysis to investigate the causality between features and the success of crowdfunding. More importantly, sentiment analysis and the paired sample t-test are performed to examine the differences in crowdfunding campaigns before and after the COVID-19 outbreak that started in March 2020. First, we note that there is significant racial disparity in crowdfunding success. Second, we find that sad emotion expressed through the campaign's description became significant after the COVID-19 outbreak. Considering all these factors, our findings shed light on the impact of COVID-19 on crowdfunding campaigns.","Wang, Junda; Zhang, Xupin; Luo, Jiebo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09981v2.pdf,251

Additionally, we have shown that woodsmoke particulates (WSP) affect responses to influenza in a sex-dependent manner. In the present study, we used human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) from both sexes to investigate how particulate exposure could modulate gene expression in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used diesel exhaust particulate (DEP) as well as WSP derived from eucalyptus or red oak wood. HNECs were exposed to particulates at a concentration of 22 g/cm2 for 2 h then immediately infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 0.5. Exposure to particulates had no significant effects on viral load recovered from infected cells. Without particulate exposure, hNECs from both sexes displayed a robust upregulation of antiviral host response genes, though the response was greater in males. However, WSP exposure before infection dampened expression of genes related to the antiviral host response by 72 h post infection. Specifically, red oak WSP downregulated IFIT1, IFITM3, IFNB1, MX1, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL11, CXCL10, and DDX58, among others. After sex stratification of these results, we found that exposure to WSP prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection downregulated anti-viral gene expression in hNECs from females more so than males.

369332,Reply to letter to the editor,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Prevention and therapy of immunothrombosis remain crucial challenges in the management of coronavirus disease 2019, since the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that endothelial damage may lead to substantially increased concentrations of von Willebrand factor with subsequent relative deficiency of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13). DESIGN: Prospective controlled cross-over trial. SETTING: Blood samples of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 and healthy controls were obtained in three German hospitals and analyzed in a German hemostaseologic laboratory. PATIENTS: Seventy-five patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 of mild to critical severity and 30 healthy controls. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: von Willebrand factor antigen, ADAMTS13, and von Willebrand factor multimer formation were analyzed. von Willebrand factor antigen was 4.1 times higher in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls (p < 0.0001), whereas ADAMTS13 activities were not significantly different (p = 0.18). The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio was significantly lower in COVID-19 than in the control group (24.4 ± 20.5 vs 82.0 ± 30.7; p < 0.0001). Fourteen patients (18.7%) undercut a critical ratio of 10 as described in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Gel analysis of multimers resembled a thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura pattern with loss of the largest multimers in 75% and a smeary triplet pattern in 39% of the patients. The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio decreased continuously from mild to critical disease (analysis of variance p = 0.026). Furthermore, it differed significantly between surviving patients and those who died from COVID-19 (p = 0.001) yielding an area under the curve of 0.232 in receiver operating characteristic curve curve analysis. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with a substantial increase in von Willebrand factor levels, which can exceed the ADAMTS13 processing capacity resulting in the formation of large von Willebrand factor multimers indistinguishable from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio is an independent predictor of severity of disease and mortality. These findings provide a rationale to consider plasma exchange as a therapeutic option in COVID-19 and to include von Willebrand factor and ADAMTS13 in the diagnostic workup.","Doevelaar, Adrian A N; Bachmann, Martin; Hölzer, Bodo; Seibert, Felix S; Rohn, Benjamin J; Bauer, Frederic; Witzke, Oliver; Dittmer, Ulf; Bachmann, Michael; Yilmaz, Serap; Dittmer, Rita; Schneppenheim, Sonja; Babel, Nina; Budde, Ulrich; Westhoff, Timm H",Crit Care Med,,251

372759,Seasonal influenza vaccination and the heightened risk of coronavirus and other pandemic virus infections: fact or fiction?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The CoSHeP study provides novel data on SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion rates in healthcare professionals (HP) at risk at the University Hospital Bonn, a maximum healthcare provider in a region of 900.000 inhabitants. METHODS: Single-center, longitudinal observational study investigating rate of SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion in HP at 2 time-points. SARS-CoV-2 IgG was measured with Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. RESULTS: Overall, 150 HP were included. Median age was 35 (range: 19-68). Main operational areas were intensive care unit (53%, n = 80), emergency room (31%, n = 46), and infectious disease department (16%, n = 24). SARS-CoV-2-IgG was detected in 5 participants (3%) at inclusion in May/June 2020, and in another 11 participants at follow-up (December 2020/ January 2021). Of the 16 seropositive participants, 14 had already known their SARS-CoV-2 infection because they had performed a PCR-test previously triggered by symptoms. Trailing chains of infection by self-assessment, 31% (n = 5) of infections were acquired through private contacts, 25% (n = 4) most likely through semi-private contacts during work. 13% (n = 2) were assumed to result through contact with contagious patients, further trailing was unsuccessful in 31% (n = 5). All five participants positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG at inclusion remained positive with a median of 7 months after infection. DISCUSSION: Frontline HP caring for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Noteworthy, based upon identified chains of infection most of the infections were acquired in private environment and semi-private contacts during work. The low rate of infection through infectious patients reveals that professional hygiene standards are effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections in HP. Persisting SARS-CoV-2-IgG might indicate longer lasting immunity supporting prioritization of negative HP for vaccination.","van Bremen, Kathrin; Monin, Malte; Eis-Hübinger, Anna Maria; Marx, Benjamin; Aldabaggh, Souhaib; Streeck, Hendrik; Wasmuth, Jan-Christian; Menting, Tanja; Schlabe, Stefan; Rieke, Gereon J; Schwarze-Zander, Carolynne; Rockstroh, Jürgen K; Boesecke, Christoph",Infection,,251

374075,Developmental Landscape of Potential Vaccine Candidates Based on Viral Vector for Prophylaxis of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Aedes albopictus has a well-established presence in southern European countries, associated with recent disease outbreaks (e.g. chikungunya). Development of insecticide resistance in the vector is a major concern as its control mainly relies on the use of biocides. Data on the species' resistance status are essential for efficient and sustainable control. To date the insecticide resistance status of Ae. albopictus populations from Greece against major insecticides used in vector control remains largely unknown. METHODS: We investigated the insecticide resistance status of 19 Ae. albopictus populations from 11 regions of Greece. Bioassays were performed against diflubenzuron (DFB), Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti), deltamethrin and malathion. Known insecticide resistance loci were molecularly analysed, i.e. voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) mutations associated with pyrethroid resistance; presence and frequency of carboxylesterases 3 (CCEae3a) and 6 (CCEae6a) gene amplification associated with organophosphate (OP) resistance and; chitin synthase-1 (CHS-1) for the possible presence of DFB resistance mutations. RESULTS: Bioassays showed full susceptibility to DFB, Bti and deltamethrin, but resistance against the OP malathion (range of mortality: 55.30-91.40%). VGSC analysis revealed a widespread distribution of the mutations F1534C (in all populations, with allelic frequencies between 6.6-68.3%), and I1532T (in 6 populations; allelic frequencies below 22.70%), but absence of V1016G. CCE gene amplifications were recorded in 8 out of 11 populations (overall frequency: 33%). Co-presence of the F1534C mutation and CCEae3a amplification was reported in 39 of the 156 samples analysed by both assays. No mutations at the CHS-1 I1043 locus were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate: (i) the suitability of larvicides DFB and Bti for Ae. albopictus control in Greece; (ii) possible incipient pyrethroid resistance due to the presence of kdr mutations; and (iii) possible reduced efficacy of OPs, in a scenario of re-introducing them for vector control. The study highlights the need for systematic resistance monitoring for developing and implementing appropriate evidence-based control programmes.","Balaska, Sofia; Fotakis, Emmanouil A; Kioulos, Ilias; Grigoraki, Linda; Mpellou, Spyridoula; Chaskopoulou, Alexandra; Vontas, John",Parasit Vectors,,251

One way to achieve it is through an overview of what is considered relevant by the general public, and referred to in the media. To this end, we have collected a number of news clips that mention the possible goals and requirements for a mitigation strategy. The snippets are sorted thematically into several categories, such as health-related goals, social and political impact, civil rights, ethical requirements, and so on. In a forthcoming companion paper, we will present a digest of the requirements, derived from the news clips, and a preliminary take on their formal specification.","Jamroga, Wojciech; Mestel, David; Roenne, Peter B.; Ryan, Peter Y.

Methods: We estimated the actual number of COVID-19 cases using the reported number of deaths in Brazil and each state, and the expected case-fatality ratio from the World Health Organization. Brazil’s expected case-fatality ratio was also adjusted by the population’s age pyramid. Therefore, the notification rate can be defined as the number of confirmed cases (notified by the Ministry of Health) divided by the number of expected cases (estimated from the number of deaths). Results: The reporting rate for COVID-19 in Brazil was estimated at 9.2% (95%CI 8.8% - 9.5%), with all the states presenting rates below 30%. São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the most populated states in Brazil, showed small reporting rates (8.9% and 7.2%, respectively). The highest reporting rate occurred in Roraima (31.7%) and the lowest in Paraiba (3.4%). Conclusion: The results indicated that the reporting of confirmed cases in Brazil is much lower as compared to other countries we analyzed. Therefore, decision-makers, including the government, fail to know the actual dimension of the pandemic, which may interfere with the determination of control measures.","Do Prado, Marcelo Freitas; De Paula Antunes, Bianca Brandão; Dos Santos Lourenço Bastos, Leonardo; Peres, Igor Tona; De Araújo Batista Da Silva, Amanda; Dantas, Leila Figueiredo; Baião, Fernanda Araújo; Maçaira, Paula; Hamacher, Silvio; Bozza, Fernando Augusto",Rev.

However, scientific validation is vital to recommend spices as nutraceuticals or functional foods. In the present work, we have selected three spices based on Ayurvedic knowledge and developed a nutraceutical for immunomodulation. Trikatu, a blend of ginger, black pepper, and long pepper, is used in the Indian Ayurvedic system, along with many herbs, for various ailments. We formulated a ""Trikatu syrup"" (TS) using these three spices and palmyra palm neera. Carbon clearance assay, neutrophil adhesion test, and sheep red blood cell (SRBC)-induced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction was performed to investigate the immunomodulatory potential of TS in Wistar Albino rats. The rats fed with TS showed a dose-dependent increase in footpad thickness compared to control rats, suggesting cell-mediated immunity. The major bioactive piperine in TS was isolated and quantified. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Spices are consumed worldwide as a flavor enhancer in food. Besides, spices have an array of bioactive molecules with a multitude of health benefits. In the backdrop of COVID-19, immunomodulation and antiviral properties of spices are discussed widely. The present study is intended to explore the potential of three selected spices (ginger, black pepper, and long pepper) beyond its application in typical food preparations. The syrup formulated in this study by using these three spices improved cell-mediated immunity in Wistar Albino rats. The study warrants further validation studies of the formulated product for providing indisputable claims for the immunomodulation properties.","Somasekharan Nair Rajam, Suja; Neenthamadathil Mohandas, Krishnakumar; Vellolipadikkal, Habeeba; Viswanathan Leena, Syamnath; Kollery Suresh, Veena; Natakkakath Kaliyathan, Raveena; Sreedharan Nair, Rajasekharan; Lankalapalli, Ravi Shankar; Mullan Velandy, Reshma",J Food Biochem,,251

Here, we compare the susceptibilities of three dwarf hamster species (Phodopus spp.) to SARS-CoV-2 and introduce the Roborovski dwarf hamster (P. roborovskii) as a highly susceptible COVID-19 model with consistent and fulminant clinical signs. Particularly, only this species shows SARS-CoV-2-induced severe acute diffuse alveolar damage and hyaline microthrombi in the lungs, changes described in patients who succumbed to the infection but not reproduced in any experimentally infected animal. Based on our findings, we propose the Roborovski dwarf hamster as a valuable model to examine the efficacy and safety of vaccine candidates and therapeutics, particularly for use in highly susceptible individuals.","Trimpert, Jakob; Vladimirova, Daria; Dietert, Kristina; Abdelgawad, Azza; Kunec, Dusan; Dökel, Simon; Voss, Anne; Gruber, Achim D; Bertzbach, Luca D; Osterrieder, Nikolaus",Cell Rep,,251

Heavily glycosylated S trimers bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and mediate entry of virions into target cells2-6. S exhibits extensive conformational flexibility: it modulates exposure of its receptor-binding site and subsequently undergoes complete structural rearrangement to drive fusion of viral and cellular membranes2,7,8. The structures and conformations of soluble, overexpressed, purified S proteins have been studied in detail using cryo-electron microscopy2,7,9-12, but the structure and distribution of S on the virion surface remain unknown. Here we applied cryo-electron microscopy and tomography to image intact SARS-CoV-2 virions and determine the high-resolution structure, conformational flexibility and distribution of S trimers in situ on the virion surface.

380575,Recent advances in the diagnosis of COVID-19: A bird's eye view,2021,"OBJECTIVE: We assessed the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared with that in a matched cohort with similar cardiovascular risk factors and the effects of DVT and PE on the hospital course. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalized from March 11, 2020 to September 4, 2020. The patients were randomly matched in a 1:1 ratio by age, sex, hospital of admission, smoking history, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease with a cohort of patients without COVID-19. The primary endpoint was the incidence of DVT/PE and the odds of developing DVT/PE using a conditional logistic regression model. The secondary endpoint was the hospitalization outcomes for COVID-19 patients with and without DVT/PE, including mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU stay, and length of hospitalization (LOH). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the variables associated with mortality, ICU admission, discharge disposition, ICU duration, and LOH. RESULTS: A total of 13,310 patients had tested positive for COVID-19, 915 of whom (6.9%) had been hospitalized across our multisite health care system. The mean age of the hospitalized patients was 60.8 ± 17.0 years, and 396 (43.3%) were women. Of the 915 patients, 82 (9.0%) had had a diagnosis of DVT/PE confirmed by ultrasound examination of the extremities and/or computed tomography angiography of the chest. The odds of presenting with DVT/PE in the setting of COVID-19 infection was greater than that without COVID-19 infection (0.6% [5 of 915] vs 9.0% [82 of 915]; odds ratio [OR], 18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.0-51.2; P < .001). The vascular risk factors were not different between the COVID-19 patients with and without DVT/PE. Mortality (P = .02), the need for ICU stay (P < .001), duration of ICU stay (P < .001), and LOH (P < .001) were greater in the DVT/PE cohort than in the cohort without DVT/PE. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, the hemoglobin (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.46-0.95; P = .04) and D-dimer (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.33-1.56; P = .03) levels were associated with higher mortality. Higher activated partial thromboplastin times (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.00-1.12; P = .03) and higher interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P = .05) were associated with a greater risk of ICU admission. IL-6 (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; P = .05) was associated with a greater risk of rehabilitation placement after discharge. On multivariable gamma regression analysis, hemoglobin (coefficient, -3.0; 95% CI, 0.03-0.08; P = .005) was associated with a prolonged ICU stay, and the activated partial thromboplastin time (coefficient, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.003-0.006; P = .05), international normalized ratio (coefficient, -3.2; 95% CI, 0.06-0.19; P = .002) and IL-6 (coefficient, 2.4; 95% CI, 0.0011-0.0027; P = .02) were associated with a prolonged LOH. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly greater incidence of DVT/PE occurred in hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients compared with a non-COVID-19 cohort matched for cardiovascular risk factors. Patients affected by DVT/PE were more likely to experience greater mortality, to require ICU admission, and experience prolonged ICU stays and LOH compared with COVID-19-positive patients without DVT/PE. Advancements in DVT/PE prevention are needed for patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection.","Erben, Young; Franco-Mesa, Camila; Gloviczki, Peter; Stone, William; Quinones-Hinojoas, Alfredo; Meltzer, Andrew J; Lin, Michelle; Greenway, Melanie R F; Hamid, Osman; Devcic, Zlatko; Toskich, Beau; Ritchie, Charles; Lamb, Christopher J; De Martino, Randall R; Siegel, Jason; Farres, Houssan; Hakaim, Albert G; Sanghavi, Devang K; Li, Yupeng; Rivera, Candido; Moreno-Franco, Pablo; O039,; Keefe, Nancy L; Gopal, Neethu; Marquez, Christopher P; Huang, Josephine F; Kalra, Manju; Shields, Raymond; Prudencio, Mercedes; Gendron, Tania; McBane, Robert; Park, Myung; Hoyne, Jonathan B; Petrucelli, Leonard; Horo, John C; Meschia, James F",J.

It is critical to understand the differential experiences within minoritized communities to ensure effective intervention and vaccine rollout. Methods: In a national online survey of U.S. adult SGM individuals, conducted between April and August 2020, 932 participants responded about COVID-19 testing, symptoms, interest in vaccination, and interest in at-home testing. Bivariate associations between these outcomes and demographic factors, including sexual orientation, gender identity, endorsing intersex traits, gender modality, race/ethnicity, and HIV status were calculated. Results: Despite 24% of the sample reporting COVID-19 symptoms, testing was relatively low at 13.3%. Transgender and bisexual/pansexual individuals were more likely to be interested in a COVID-19 vaccine and an at-home test compared with cisgender and gay/lesbian respondents, respectively. Compared with cisgender individuals, transgender individuals were nearly twice as likely to report COVID-19 symptoms. Latinx individuals were less likely to be interested in a future COVID-19 vaccination and Black individuals were less likely to be interested in an at-home COVID-19 test compared with White participants. Both respondents who endorsed intersex traits and people with HIV were less likely to be interested in an at-home test compared with those who did not endorse having intersex traits and people without HIV, respectively. Conclusions: These results show critical disparities in COVID-19 symptomology and prevention interest within SGM populations that must be taken into account when designing or tailoring effective COVID-19 interventions.","Phillips Ii, Gregory; Xu, Jiayi; Ruprecht, Megan M; Costa, Diogo; Felt, Dylan; Wang, Xinzi; Glenn, Erik Elías; Beach, Lauren B",LGBT Health,,251

386033,COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced hospices to look for more ways to support people remotely, including psychological support. Emotional disclosure-based interventions hold potential as a way of providing support remotely. However, evidence of their efficacy in people with terminal illness is mixed. Reviews have highlighted this may be due to interventions not being tailored to the unique needs of this population. In response to this, we are developing Let It Out (LIO), an online, self-guided emotional disclosure-based intervention tailored for people living with terminal illness. AIMS: The primary objective of the study is to optimise the design of the LIO intervention. Secondary objectives include assessing its acceptability and feasibility; exploring potential impact on well-being; identifying potential adverse effects; and informing choice of outcome measures for potential future evaluation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A single arm, mixed-methods, multisite, longitudinal study. Up to 40 people living with a terminal illness under the care of hospices in England and Scotland will receive the online LIO intervention. LIO consists of 3, self-guided expression sessions over 2 weeks. The primary outcome measures are (1) a structured feedback form completed by participants after the final expression session; and (2) semi-structured interviews and focus groups with &#8804;15 patient participants, &#8804;30 hospice staff and &#8804;15 informal carers. These quantitative and qualitative data will be triangulated via process evaluation to inform optimisation of the intervention design. Secondary outcome measures include validated measures of physical and psychological health collected at baseline and after the final expression session (immediately, 1, 4 and 8 weeks after); and data on recruitment, retention and fidelity. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the University College London Research Ethics Committee (reference: 15281/002). The findings will be shared through peer-reviewed scientific journals and conferences, and traditional, online and social media platforms.","McInnerney, Daisy; Candy, Bridget; Stone, Patrick; Kupeli, Nuriye",BMJ Open,,251

The influence of benefits, accuracy, and privacy on willingness to adopt",2020-05-09,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), an inhibitor of Wnt signaling, plays a role in amyloid-induced toxicity and hence Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the effect of DKK1 expression on protein expression, and whether such proteins are altered in disease, is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We aim to test whether DKK1 induced protein signature obtained in vitro were associated with markers of AD pathology as used in the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (ATN) framework as well as with clinical outcomes. METHODS: We first overexpressed DKK1 in HEK293A cells and quantified 1,128 proteins in cell lysates using aptamer capture arrays (SomaScan) to obtain a protein signature induced by DKK1. We then used the same assay to measure the DKK1-signature proteins in human plasma in two large cohorts, EMIF (n = 785) and ANM (n = 677). RESULTS: We identified a 100-protein signature induced by DKK1 in vitro. Subsets of proteins, along with age and apolipoprotein E É4 genotype distinguished amyloid pathology (A + T-N-, A+T+N-, A+T-N+, and A+T+N+) from no AD pathology (A-T-N-) with an area under the curve of 0.72, 0.81, 0.88, and 0.85, respectively. Furthermore, we found that some signature proteins (e.g., Complement C3 and albumin) were associated with cognitive score and AD diagnosis in both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Our results add further evidence for a role of DKK regulation of Wnt signaling in AD and suggest that DKK1 induced signature proteins obtained in vitro could reflect theATNframework as well as predict disease severity and progression in vivo.","Shi, Liu; Winchester, Laura M; Liu, Benjamine Y; Killick, Richard; Ribe, Elena M; Westwood, Sarah; Baird, Alison L; Buckley, Noel J; Hong, Shengjun; Dobricic, Valerija; Kilpert, Fabian; Franke, Andre; Kiddle, Steven; Sattlecker, Martina; Dobson, Richard; Cuadrado, Antonio; Hye, Abdul; Ashton, Nicholas J; Morgan, Angharad R; Bos, Isabelle; Vos, Stephanie J B; Ten Kate, Mara; Scheltens, Philip; Vandenberghe, Rik; Gabel, Silvy; Meersmans, Karen; Engelborghs, Sebastiaan; De Roeck, Ellen E; Sleegers, Kristel; Frisoni, Giovanni B; Blin, Olivier; Richardson, Jill C; Bordet, Régis; Molinuevo, José L; Rami, Lorena; Wallin, Anders; Kettunen, Petronella; Tsolaki, Magda; Verhey, Frans; Lleó, Alberto; Alcolea, Daniel; Popp, Julius; Peyratout, Gwendoline; Martinez-Lage, Pablo; Tainta, Mikel; Johannsen, Peter; Teunissen, Charlotte E; Freund-Levi, Yvonne; Frölich, Lutz; Legido-Quigley, Cristina",J. alzheimers dis,,251

Deep learning has a significant impact on NLP research. However, the deep learning models used in several studies, especially in document summary, still have a deficiency. For example, the maximum output of long text provides incorrectly. The other results are redundant, or the characters repeatedly appeared so that the resulting sentences were less organized, and the recall value obtained was low. This study aims to summarize using a deep learning model implemented to COVID-19 news documents. We proposed Transformer as base language models with architectural modification as the basis for designing the model to improve results significantly in document summarization. We make a Transformer-based architecture model with encoder and decoder that can be done several times repeatedly and make a comparison of layer modifications based on scoring. From the resulting experiment used, ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 show the good performance for the proposed model with scores 0.58 and 0.42, respectively, with a training time of 11438 seconds.

The transition to only emergent and essential urgent surgical cases raises the question, how and when will hospitals and surgery centers resume elective cases? As a large health care system providing multispecialty tertiary/quaternary care with across the Southeast United States, a collaborative approach to resuming elective surgery is critical. Numerous surgical societies have outlined a tiered approach to resuming elective surgery. The majority of these guidelines are suggestions which place the responsibility of making decisions about re-entry strategy on individual health care systems and practitioners, taking into account the local case burden, projected case surge, and availability of resources and personnel. This paper reviews challenges and solutions related to the resumption of elective surgeries and returning to the pre-COVID-19 surgical volume within an integrated health care system that actively manages 18 facilities, 111 operating rooms, and an annual operative volume exceeding 123,000 cases.

We examined if corticosteroids and tocilizumab reduce risk for death in patients with severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in a single university hospital. All adult patients admitted with confirmed severe COVID-19 pneumonia from 9 March to 9 April 2020 were included. Severe pneumonia was defined as multi-lobar or bilateral pneumonia and a ratio of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry to the fraction of inspired oxygen (SpFi)<315. All patients received antiviral and antibiotic treatment. From March 26, patients also received immunomodulatory treatment with corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 250 mg/day for 3 days), or tocilizumab or both. In-hospital mortality in the entire cohort and in a 1:1 matched cohort sub-analysis was evaluated. RESULTS: 255 patients were included, 118 received only antiviral and antibiotic treatment while 137, admitted after March 26, also received immunomodulators. In-hospital mortality of patients on immunomodulatory treatment was significantly lower than in those without [47/137(34.3%) vs. 69/118(58.5%), (p < .001)]. The risk of death was 0.44 (CI, 0.26-0.76) in patients receiving corticosteroids alone and 0.292 (CI, 0.18-0.47) in those treated with corticosteroids and tocilizumab. In the sub-analysis with 202 matched patients, the risk of death was 0.356 (CI 0.179-0.707) in patients receiving corticosteroids alone and 0.233 (0.124-0.436) in those treated with the combination. CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment with corticosteroids and tocilizumab reduced mortality with about 25% in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Corticosteroids alone also resulted in lower in-hospital mortality rate compared to patients receiving only antiviral and antibiotic treatment. Corticosteroids alone or combined with tocilizumab may be considered in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","Van den Eynde, E; Gasch, O; Oliva, J C; Prieto, E; Calzado, S; Gomila, A; Machado, M L; Falgueras, L; Ortonobes, S; Morón, A; Capilla, S; Navarro, G; Oristrell, J; Cervantes, M; Navarro, M",Infect Dis (Lond),,251

In this study, we evaluated the possibility of automatizing this estimation using semi-supervised AI-based Radiomics, leveraging the possibility of performing non-supervised segmentation of ground-glass areas. Methods: We collected 92 from patients treated in the IRCCS Sant’Orsola-Malpighi Policlinic and public databases;each lung was segmented using a pre-trained AI method;ground-glass opacity was identified using a novel, non-supervised approach;radiomic measurements were collected and used to predict clinically relevant scores, with particular focus on mortality and the PREDI-CO score. We compared the prediction obtained through different machine learning approaches. Results: All the methods obtained a well-balanced accuracy (70%) on the PREDI-CO score but did not obtain satisfying results on other clinical characteristics due to unbalance between the classes. Conclusions: Semi-supervised segmentation, implemented using a combination of non-supervised segmentation and feature extraction, seems to be a viable approach for patient stratification and could be leveraged to train more complex models. This would be useful in a high-demand situation similar to the current pandemic to support gold-standard segmentation for AI training.","Biondi, Riccardo Curti Nico Coppola Francesca Giampieri Enrico Vara Giulio Bartoletti Michele Cattabriga Arrigo Cocozza Maria Adriana Ciccarese Federica De Benedittis Caterina Cercenelli Laura Bortolani Barbara Marcelli Emanuela Pierotti Luisa Strigari Lidia Viale Pierluigi Golfieri Rita Castellani Gastone",Applied Sciences,,251

METHOD: Search engines including PubMed, Embase, Ovid and Google Scholar were searched from December 2019 to the 15 September 2020 to identify studies reporting ACS admission data during COVID-19 pandemic months in 2020 compared with 2019 admissions. RESULTS: A total of 40 studies were included in this multistudy analysis. They demonstrated a 28.1% reduction in the rate of admission with ACS during the COVID-19 pandemic period compared with the same period in 2019 (total of 28 613 patients in 2020 vs 39 225 in 2019). There was a significant correlation between the absolute risk reduction in the total number of ACS cases and the number of COVID-19 cases per 100 000 population (Pearson correlation=0.361 (p=0.028)). However, the correlation was not significant for each of the ACS subgroups: non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (p=0.508), STEMI (p=0883) and unstable angina (p=0.175). CONCLUSION: There was a significant reduction in the rate of ACS admission during the COVID-19 pandemic period compared with the same period in 2019 with a significant correlation with COVID-19 prevalence.","Helal, Ayman; Shahin, Lamis; Abdelsalam, Mahmoud; Ibrahim, Mokhtar",,,251

397083,Immune Correlates Analysis of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy Trial,2021,"Great efforts have been made to limit the transmission of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), however, the intestinal reservoir of these strains and its modulation by various antibiotics remain largely unexplored. Our aim was to assess the effects of antibiotic administration (ampicillin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin) on the establishment and elimination of intestinal colonization with a CTX-M-15 ESBL and OXA-162 carbapenemase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae ST15 (KP5825) in a murine (C57BL/6 male mice) model. Whole genome sequencing of KP5825 strain was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Conjugation assays were carried out by broth mating method. In colonization experiments, 5 × 106 CFU of KP5825 was administered to the animals by orogastric gavage, and antibiotics were administered in their drinking water for two weeks and were changed every day. The gut colonization rates with KP5825 were assessed by cultivation and qPCR. In each of the stool samples, the gene copy number of blaOXA-162 and blaCTX-M-15 were determined by qPCR. Antibiotic concentrations in the stool were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography and a bioanalytical method. The KP5825 contained four different plasmid replicon types, namely IncFII(K), IncL, IncFIB and ColpVC. IncL (containing the blaOXA-162 resistance gene within a Tn1991.2 genetic element) and IncFII(K) (containing the blaCTX-M-15 resistance gene) plasmids were successfully conjugated. During ampicillin and ceftazidime treatments, colonization rate of KP5825 increased, while, ciprofloxacin treatments in both concentrations (0.1 g/L and 0.5 g/L) led to significantly decreased colonization rates. The gene copy number blaOXA-162 correlated with K. pneumoniae in vivo, while a major elevation was observed in the copy number of blaCTX-M-15 from the first day to the fifteenth day in the 0.5 g/L dose ceftazidime treatment group. Our results demonstrate that commonly used antibiotics may have diverse impacts on the colonization rates of intestinally-carried CPE, in addition to affecting the gene copy number of their resistance genes, thus facilitating their stable persistance and dissemination.","Stercz, Balázs; Farkas, Ferenc B; Tóth, Ákos; Gajdács, Márió; Domokos, Judit; Horváth, Viola; Ostorházi, Eszter; Makra, Nóra; Kocsis, Béla; Juhász, János; Ligeti, Balázs; Pongor, Sándor; Szabó, Dóra",Sci Rep,,251
397506,P14 Lung cancer referrals: the impact of the coronavirus pandemic,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus of the coronavirus family responsible for a global pandemic since December 2019. More than 35 million people have been affected with the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), with more than one million deaths worldwide. Michigan was one of the top three states in the United States that was severely affected by the SAR-CoV-2 pandemic with more than 7000 deaths in adults and greater than 145,000 confirmed infections. However, compared to adults, the majority of children until recently were either asymptomatic or had a mild illness with SARS-CoV-2. Recently, a rare but potentially serious presentation associated with SARS-CoV-2 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been recently reported and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released a case definition for the same. We report the clinical and laboratory presentations and outcomes of 34 children with MIS-C who were evaluated within a 12 week period at a pediatric emergency department (PED) of single institution in Michigan. These cases presented approximately three weeks after the peak of adult SAR-CoV-2 related deaths occurred in the state. While many children presented with clinical characteristics similar to incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD), they also exhibited certain unique features which differentiated MIS-C from KD. The information presented below will aid clinicians with early recognition, evaluation and management of MIS-C in the emergency department.","Sethuraman, Usha; Kannikeswaran, Nirupama; Ang, Jocelyn; Singer, Adam; Miller, Jason; Haddad, Rita; Stankovic, Curt",Am J Emerg Med,,251

398122,Pre-hospital hypothermia is associated with transfusion risk after traumatic injury,2020,"Coronaviruses are a group of viruses causing disease in a wide range of animals including humans. Since 2002, the successive emergence of bat-borne severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 have reinforced efforts in uncovering the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms governing coronavirus cell tropism and interspecies transmission. Decades of studies have led to the discovery of a broad set of carbohydrate and protein receptors for many animal and human coronaviruses. As the main determinant of coronavirus entry, the spike protein binds to these receptors and mediates membrane fusion. Prone to mutations and recombination, spike evolution has been studied extensively. The interactions between spike proteins and their receptors are often complex and despite many advances in the field, there remains many unresolved questions concerning coronavirus tropism modification and cross-species transmission, potentially leading to delays in outbreak responses. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 underscores the need to address these outstanding issues in order to better anticipate new outbreaks. In this review, we discuss the latest advances in the field of coronavirus receptors emphasizing on the molecular and evolutionary processes that underlie coronavirus receptor usage and host range expansion.","Millet, Jean K; Jaimes, Javier A; Whittaker, Gary R",FEMS microbiol. rev,,251

Our work highlights the ways in which these complementary datasets can be used by economists to conduct near real-time macroeconomic surveillance work covering labour market responses to macroeconomic shocks, including for seemingly information scarce African economies. We find that Angola, South Africa and Zimbabwe are at greatest risk across several labour market dimensions from the COVID-19 shock, followed by a second group of countries consisting of Comoros, DRC, Madagascar and Mauritius. Angola faces relatively less general employment risk than South Africa and Zimbabwe due to more muted decreases in mobility, though faces large pressure in its primary sector. These countries all face high risk in their youth populations, with Angola and Zimbabwe seeing high risks for women. South Africa faces more sector-specific risks in their secondary and tertiary sectors, as does Mauritius. Comoros, DRC and Madagascar all face high risks of employment loss for women and youth, with Comoros and Mauritius facing severe general employment risks.","Rosenberg, Joshua Strauss Ilan Isaacs Gilad",African Development Review,,251
400089,Oxidative stress and inflammation in COVID-19 pathogenesis,2020,"This paper reports on the impact on student teachers' professional skills, knowledge and attitudes of engaging in the eTwinning international Hands of the World (HOTW) project which connects over 2000 students and their teachers in 50 schools across the world to undertake a wide range of educational collaborative work, supported by digital and online technologies. The University of Dundee's HOTW project won the eTwinning prize for the best project two years running and is the only university to have won this annual prize. Student teachers are working in a world where digital technology is firmly embedded and undergoing rapid expansion and change. This study examined the experiences of student teachers as they engaged in a global project to develop their knowledge and understanding of intercultural learning using ICT. An explanatory sequential mixed method design analyzed data publicly available on YouTube (TM) and Padlet (TM). Two main data sets were used: responses to professional development webinars and reflections on participating in the project. Data were analyzed thematically focusing on ICT competence, pedagogy and relevance. Participation in the project enhanced the students' ICT competence and confidence to use and explore technology for current and future teaching practice through contextualization and social learning. Our analysis enabled us to identify that the Covid-19 lockdown had a positive impact on the students' learning due to time, space, and relevance. This paper demonstrates that engagement in a contextualized project enabled student teachers to develop their ICT competences and that for many, lockdown provided a conducive learning environment.","Tonner-Saunders, S.; Shimi, J.",Pixel-Bit- Revista De Medios Y Educacion,,251

400796,The gray zone of thyroid nodules: Using a nomogram to provide malignancy risk assessment and guide patient management,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has seen an unprecedented shutdown of society. Among the various safety measures taken, much attention has been given to school closure as a non-pharmaceutical mitigation tool to curb the spread of the disease through ensuring ""social"" (physical) distancing. Nearly 1.725 billion children in over 95% of countries worldwide have been affected by school closures implemented in April 2020 as the virus continued to spread. In the field of education, policymakers' attention has been directed at keeping students on board through remote learning and addressing the immediate needs of schools upon reopening. The study presented in this article focuses on who remains absent after schools resume. Using publicly available survey data from the USAID Demographic Health Surveys Program and the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey from before and after the 2013-2016 Ebola pandemic in Guinea and Sierra Leone in West Africa, the author examined changes in school enrolment and dropout patterns, with targeted consideration given to traditionally marginalised groups. At the time, schools closed for between seven to nine months in the two countries; this length and intensity makes this Ebola pandemic the only health crisis in the recent past to come close to the pandemic-related school closures experienced in 2020. The author's findings suggest that post-Ebola, youth in the poorest households saw the largest increase in school dropout. Exceeding expected pre-Ebola dropout rates, an additional 17,400 of the poorest secondary-age youth were out of school. This evidence is important for minimising the likely post-COVID-19 expansion in inequality. The author's findings point to the need for sustainable planning that looks beyond the reopening of educational institutions to include comprehensive financial support packages for groups most likely to be affected.","Smith, William C",Int Rev Educ,,251

Despite substantial ramp-up in test volume, access to SARS-CoV-2 testing remains limited, heterogeneous, and insufficient to control spread. METHODS: We compared SARS-CoV-2 testing rates across geographic regions, over time, and by demographic characteristics (i.e., age and racial/ethnic groups) in Illinois during March through December 2020. We compared age-matched case fatality ratios and infection fatality ratios through time to estimate the fraction of SARS-CoV-2 infections that have been detected through diagnostic testing. RESULTS: By the end of 2020, initial geographic differences in testing rates had closed substantially. Case fatality ratios were higher in non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latino populations in Illinois relative to non-Hispanic White populations, suggesting that tests were insufficient to accurately capture the true burden of COVID-19 disease in the minority populations during the initial epidemic wave. While testing disparities decreased during 2020, Hispanic/Latino populations consistently remained the least tested at 1.87 tests per 1000 population per day compared with 2.58 and 2.87 for non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White populations, respectively, at the end of 2020. Despite a large expansion in testing since the beginning of the first wave of the epidemic, we estimated that over half (50-80%) of all SARS-CoV-2 infections were not detected by diagnostic testing and continued to evade surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic methods for identifying relatively under-tested geographic regions and demographic groups may enable policymakers to regularly monitor and evaluate the shifting landscape of diagnostic testing, allowing officials to prioritize allocation of testing resources to reduce disparities in COVID-19 burden and eventually reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Holden, Tobias M; Richardson, Reese A K; Arevalo, Philip; Duffus, Wayne A; Runge, Manuela; Whitney, Elena; Wise, Leslie; Ezike, Ngozi O; Patrick, Sarah; Cobey, Sarah; Gerardin, Jaline",BMC Public Health,,251

404875,Perioperative Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents in the COVID-19 Orthopedic Patient,2020,"BACKGROUND: Thyroid nodules have a low prevalence of malignancy and most proven cancers do not behave aggressively. Thus, risk-stratification of nodules is a critical step to avoid surgical overtreatment. We hypothesized that a risk management system superior to those currently in use could be created to reduce the number of clinically indeterminate nodules (i.e., the ""gray zone"") by concurrently considering the malignancy risks conferred by clinical, ultrasonographic, and cytologic variables. METHODS: Thyroidectomy cases were reviewed from three institutions. Their benign versus malignant outcome was used to evaluate the variables for correlation. A binary logistic regression model was trained and, using indeterminate nodules with Bethesda III and IV results, validated. A scoring nomogram was designed to demonstrate the application of the model in clinical practice. RESULTS: One hundred thirty thyroidectomies (28% malignant) met inclusion criteria. The final logistic regression model included difficulty in swallowing, hypothyroidism, echogenicity, hypervascularity, margins, calcification, and cytology diagnosis as input parameters. The model was highly successful in determining the outcome (p value: 0.001) with a R2 (Nagelkerke) score of 0.93. The area under the curve as determined by receiver operating characteristics was 0.91. The accuracy of the model on the training dataset was 93% (sensitivity and specificity 92% and 96%, respectively) and, on the validation dataset, 80% (sensitivity and specificity 91% and 67%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We report a model for risk assessment of thyroid nodules that has the potential to significantly reduce indeterminates and surgical overtreatment. We illustrate its application via a straightforward nomogram, which integrates clinical, ultrasonographic, and cytologic data, and can be used to create clear, evidence-based management plans for patients.","Yousefi, Elham; Sura, Gloria H; Somma, Jonathan",Cancer med,,251

Psychological factors that promote resilience might beneficially contribute also to promoting a better HRQoL among elderly subjects. The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the contribution of dispositional optimism and expressive flexibility on the HRQoL of elderly outpatients during the COVID-19 outbreak. The outpatients were recruited from October 2018 to October 2019, and then followed-up during April 2020, by evaluating their HRQoL. The baseline sample consisted of 141 elderly outpatients (mean age 80.31 ± 6.84 years); the final number of outpatients included in the follow-up evaluation was 104 (mean age 80.26 ± 6.39). Univariate and multivariate linear regressions were developed to explore significant associations with the physical and mental component of HRQoL. Baseline dispositional optimism was a predictor of the mental component of HRQoL at follow-up; the flexible suppression of emotional expression was a predictor of the physical component of HRQoL at follow-up. From a psychogeriatric perspective, the accurate assessment of psychological factors, such as dispositional optimism and expressive flexibility, might help physicians and psychologists to recognize additional patients' vulnerabilities during the current emergency.","Sardella, Alberto; Lenzo, Vittorio; Bonanno, George A; Basile, Giorgio; Quattropani, Maria C",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,251

To identify asymptomatic cases among patients receiving active cancer treatment, the Federico II University Hospital in Naples performs rapid serological tests in addition to hospital standard clinical triage for COVID-19 infection. METHODS: From 6 to 17 April 2020, all candidates for chemotherapy, radiotherapy or target/immunotherapy, if negative at the standard clinical triage on the day scheduled for anticancer treatment, received a rapid serological test on peripheral blood for COVID-19 IgM and IgG detection. In case of COVID-19 IgM and/or IgG positivity, patients underwent a real-time PCR (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 test to confirm infection, and active cancer treatment was delayed. RESULTS: Overall 466 patients, negative for COVID-19 symptoms, underwent serological testing in addition to standard clinical triage. The average age was 61 years (range 25-88 years). Most patients (190, 40.8%) had breast cancer, and chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy was administered in 323 (69.3%) patients. Overall 433 (92.9%) patients were IgG-negative and IgM-negative, and 33 (7.1%) were IgM-positive and/or IgG-positive. Among the latter patients, 18 (3.9%), 11 (2.4%) and 4 (0.9%) were IgM-negative/IgG-positive, IgM-positive/IgG-negative and IgM-positive/IgG-positive, respectively. All 33 patients with a positive serological test, tested negative for RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test. No patient in our cohort developed symptoms suggestive of active COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Rapid serological testing at hospital admission failed to detect active asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. Moreover, it entailed additional economic and human resources, delayed therapy administrationand increased hospital accesses.","Arpino, Grazia; De Angelis, Carmine; De Placido, Pietro; Pietroluongo, Erica; Formisano, Luigi; Bianco, Roberto; Fiore, Giovanni; Montella, Emma; Forestieri, Valeria; Lauria, Rossella; Cardalesi, Cinzia; Vozzella, Emilia Anna; Iervolino, Anna; Giuliano, Mario; De Placido, Sabino",,,251

A key component of the algorithm is componentwise ordering and parent estimations, where both problems can be efficiently addressed using '1-regularized regression. This paper proves that sample sizes n = (d2 log p) and n = (d2p2=m) are sufficient for the proposed algorithm to recover linear SEMs with sub- Gaussian and (4m)-th bounded-moment error distributions, respectively, where p is the number of nodes and d is the maximum degree of the moralized graph. Further shown is the worst-case computational complexity O(n(p3 + p2d2)), and hence, the proposed algorithm is statistically consistent and computationally feasible for learning a high-dimensional linear SEM when its moralized graph is sparse. Through simulations, we verify that the proposed algorithm is statistically consistent and computationally feasible, and it performs well compared to the state-of-the-art US, GDS, LISTEN and TD algorithms with our settings. We also demonstrate through real COVID-19 data that the proposed algorithm is well-suited to estimating a virus-spread map in China. © 2021 Microtome Publishing.

409907,Herd Immunity to COVID-19,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 epidemic was declared a Global Pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020. By 24 March 2020, over 440,000 cases and almost 20,000 deaths had been reported worldwide. In response to the fast-growing epidemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei, China imposed strict social distancing in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 followed closely by similar measures in other provinces. These interventions have impacted economic productivity in China, and the ability of the Chinese economy to resume without restarting the epidemic was not clear. Methods: Using daily reported cases from mainland China and Hong Kong SAR, we estimated transmissibility over time and compared it to daily within-city movement, as a proxy for economic activity. Results: Initially, within-city movement and transmission were very strongly correlated in the five mainland provinces most affected by the epidemic and Beijing. However, that correlation decreased rapidly after the initial sharp fall in transmissibility. In general, towards the end of the study period, the correlation was no longer apparent, despite substantial increases in within-city movement. A similar analysis for Hong Kong shows that intermediate levels of local activity were maintained while avoiding a large outbreak. At the very end of the study period, when China began to experience the re-introduction of a small number of cases from Europe and the United States, there is an apparent up-tick in transmission. Conclusions: Although these results do not preclude future substantial increases in incidence, they suggest that after very intense social distancing (which resulted in containment), China successfully exited its lockdown to some degree. Elsewhere, movement data are being used as proxies for economic activity to assess the impact of interventions. The results presented here illustrate how the eventual decorrelation between transmission and movement is likely a key feature of successful COVID-19 exit strategies.","Ainslie, Kylie E C; Walters, Caroline E; Fu, Han; Bhatia, Sangeeta; Wang, Haowei; Xi, Xiaoyue; Baguelin, Marc; Bhatt, Samir; Boonyasiri, Adhiratha; Boyd, Olivia; Cattarino, Lorenzo; Ciavarella, Constanze; Cucunuba, Zulma; Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina; Dighe, Amy; Dorigatti, Ilaria; van Elsland, Sabine L; FitzJohn, Rich; Gaythorpe, Katy; Ghani, Azra C; Green, Will; Hamlet, Arran; Hinsley, Wes; Imai, Natsuko; Jorgensen, David; Knock, Edward; Laydon, Daniel; Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma; Okell, Lucy C; Siveroni, Igor; Thompson, Hayley A; Unwin, H Juliette T; Verity, Robert; Vollmer, Michaela; Walker, Patrick G T; Wang, Yuanrong; Watson, Oliver J; Whittaker, Charles; Winskill, Peter; Donnelly, Christl A; Ferguson, Neil M; Riley, Steven",Wellcome Open Res,,251
410911,Keeping a Broad Differential Diagnosis amidst a Pandemic,2020,"Introduction: COVID 19 disease is caused by SARS CoV-2, which is a highly contagious disease. The world Health Organisation has pronounced the ongoing outbreak of virus as a global public Health Emergency. This study was conducted to asses the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice of Dental students and Dental practitioners about COVID 19 precaution. Materials and Method: An online questionnaires were shared among Dental Students and Dental Practitioners using a combination of convenience and snowball sampling.The questionnaires consists of 4 sections. 1st section includes demo-graphic details of participants, whereas the 2nd,3rd and 4th sections contains questioners related to knowledge (5 questions), attitude(5 questions) and practices (5 questions).The analysis was done by IBM SPSS for windows,v.20.0.chi square test was done and statistical significance level is p<0.05. Result: The total number of the feedback collected was 300 among the dental students and dental practitioner. The overall achieved knowledge, attitude, practices of dental students were relatively less compared to dental practitioners which shows necessary training for undergraduate students Conclusion: The knowledge, attitude and practice of dental students is less when compared to the dental practitioner. Overall attention towards undergraduate training is imminent so as to mitigate the risk of transmission of disease among dental students. As they are the future health care workers and also act as role model for the community, imparting adequate training plays crucial role in resilience of frontline workers. © 2021, SciDoc Publishers.

412522,Performance of an Automated Insulin Delivery System: Results of Early Phase Feasibility Studies,2020,"Computing an AUC as a performance measure to compare the quality of different machine learning models is one of the final steps of many research projects. Many of these methods are trained on privacy-sensitive data and there are several different approaches like $\epsilon$-differential privacy, federated machine learning and methods based on cryptographic approaches if the datasets cannot be shared or evaluated jointly at one place. In this setting, it can also be a problem to compute the global performance measure like an AUC, since the labels might also contain privacy-sensitive information. There have been approaches based on $\epsilon$-differential privacy to deal with this problem, but to the best of our knowledge, no exact privacy preserving solution has been introduced. In this paper, we propose an MPC-based framework, called \fw{}, with private merging of sorted lists and novel methods for comparing two secret-shared values, selecting between two secret-shared values, converting the modulus, and performing division to compute the exact AUC as one could obtain on the pooled original test samples. With \fw{} computation of the exact area under precision-recall curve and receiver operating characteristic curve is even possible when ties between prediction confidence values exist. To show the applicability of \fw{}, we use it to evaluate a model trained to predict acute myeloid leukemia therapy response and we also assess its scalability via experiments on synthetic data. The experiments show that we efficiently compute exactly the same AUC with both evaluation metrics in a privacy preserving manner as one can obtain on the pooled test samples in the plaintext domain. Our solution provides security against semi-honest corruption of at most one of the servers performing the secure computation.","Unal, Ali Burak; Pfeifer, Nico; Akgun, Mete",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08788v2.pdf,251

413501,Awareness and attitude of undergraduate medical students towards 2019-novel corona virus,2020,"BACKGROUND: Utilization of reproductive health services is a key component for preventing young women from different sexual and reproductive health problems. Thus, the objective of this study is to determine the factors influencing the use of reproductive health services among young women in Nepal. METHODS: Data have been extracted from the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) datasets wherein the weighted sample population size was restricted for modern contraceptive use to 1593 whereas for the antenatal care and skilled birth attendants to1606. This study has selected three reproductive health indicators as outcome variables of reproductive health service utilization for the analysis viz, modern contraceptive use, at least four antenatal care visits, and use of skilled birth attendants. Likewise, all calculations are based on standard sample weight of NDHS. RESULTS: The study has found that 21% of young women used modern contraception, 71% attended at least four ANC visits, and 67% utilized a skilled birth attendant at delivery. Young Janajati women, women having 1-2, and 3 or more living children, women participating household decision-making, and the ones having exposure to media were more likely to use modern contraceptives, whereas the women who want more children were less likely to use them. Higher education attainments, higher wealth quintile, and lower birth order were associated with higher level of receiving at least four ANC visits and SBAs. However, the young women willing to have more children and having access to media have higher odds of receiving at least four ANC visits; and the women attending four and more ANC visits have higher odds of using SBAs. CONCLUSIONS: In order to improve the use of reproductive health services among young women, efforts should be made to enrich the young women of lower educational level, lower economic status, higher birth order, and lower exposure to media. Further research is required to detect the causes that affect the use of reproductive health services.","Thapa, Naba Raj",Reprod Health,,251

Here, we report the generation and the preclinical evaluation of a novel replication-defective gorilla adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding the pre-fusion stabilized Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. We show that our vaccine candidate, GRAd-COV2, is highly immunogenic both in mice and macaques, eliciting both functional antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection and block Spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor, and a robust, T helper (Th)1-dominated cellular response. We show here that the pre-fusion stabilized Spike antigen is superior to the wild type in inducing ACE2-interfering, SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies. To face the unprecedented need for vaccine manufacturing at a massive scale, different GRAd genome deletions were compared to select the vector backbone showing the highest productivity in stirred tank bioreactors.

PURPOSE: To report our initial experience with acquiring portable chest radiographs through glass doors of isolation rooms. METHODS: Only 1 of 2 radiology technologist team members donned personal protective equipment and stayed inside the isolation room, while the second technologist and the radiography unit remained outside during the procedure. First hundred radiographs acquired through glass at the emergency department of our institute formed the ""through glass radiograph"" group. Hundred consecutive portable chest radiographs performed in a conventional manner formed the ""conventional radiograph"" group for comparison. Imaging database and feedback from operations leader were used to identify occurrences of a failed procedure. Suggestion of repeating the study and comments related to quality of the study were recorded from the reports of the staff radiologist. RESULTS: There was no instance of failed acquisition, nondiagnostic examination, or suggestion of repetition in both groups. No significant difference in the number of reports with quality related remarks (P > .05) was found between the 2 groups. Radiography through glass doors was associated with increased suboptimal positioning related remarks in radiology reports (P < .05). No significant association was identified among other comments about image quality. CONCLUSION: Our initial clinical experience suggests that the acquisition of portable chest radiographs through the glass doors of isolation rooms is technically feasible and results in diagnostic quality studies.","Rai, Archana; Ditkofsky, Noah; Hunt, Bryce; Dubrawski, Margaret; Deva, Djeven; Mathur, Shobhit",Can Assoc Radiol J,,251

A total of 1172 (683 female and 489 male) children and adolescents aged 8-18 years were involved in completing the measurements of PTSD, GAD, perceived threat of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related courtesy stigma. The Latent Profile Analysis identified the three profiles of the symptoms for PTSD and GAD which were labeled as Moderate PTSD, Mild Comorbidity, and Severe Comorbidity. The scores of the symptoms for PTSD, GAD, perceived threat, and stigma were different among the three profiles. The risk factors (i.e., perceived threat and stigma) that are related to comorbidity patterns were examined through a three-step method. The possibility of entry into the Severe Comorbidity Profile increased with increasing perceived threat and stigma. The mental health care interventions for children and adolescents who are susceptible to COVID-19 can be developed to reduce perceived threat and stigma.","Li, Yumei; Duan, Wenjie; Chen, Zheng",Child Youth Serv Rev,,251
426532,Key advances and remaining challenges in childhood and adolescent tuberculosis,2020,"This study examined self-reported changes in young adults' sexual desire and behaviors during the most significant social restrictions imposed to deal with COVID-19. Drawing on a survey of 565 British adults aged 18-32 collected at the peak of social lockdown restrictions, we document an overall decrease in sexual behaviors consistent with abiding by social restrictions. We found that the levels of sexual desire reported by women (but not men) decreased compared with reports of pre-lockdown levels. Participants in serious relationships reported more increases in sexual activity than people who were single or dating casually, and there were significant differences according to gender and sexual orientation. The perceived impact of subjective wellbeing of people with high sociosexuality scores was disproportionately associated with social lockdown but there was no effect for general health. Thus, the impact on sexuality and general wellbeing should be considered by policymakers when considering future social restrictions related to COVID-19 or other public health emergencies.","Wignall, Liam; Portch, Emma; McCormack, Mark; Owens, Rebecca; Cascalheira, Cory J; Attard-Johnson, Janice; Cole, Terri",J Sex Res,,251

This may provide increased access to diabetes health care in certain settings. However, health care disparities continue to challenge availability of diabetes technologies for underprivileged communities. We report our experience with two patients providing diabetes care effectively and preventing hospital admissions by using telehealth. Methods: Two adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D): one new onset and the other one with established T1D are presented where telehealth facilitated by Clarity Software and the ""Share"" feature with the use of Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for management of diabetic ketosis and hyperglycemia. Results: Both patients were managed effectively virtually despite higher risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Shared glucose data through CGM facilitated frequent insulin dose adjustments, increased fluid and carbohydrate intake, and prevented hospital admissions in both cases. In the case of new onset patient with T1D, most of the education was done remotely by certified diabetes care and education specialists. Conclusion: Acute diabetes complication like DKA increases morbidity and mortality in addition to adding cost to the health care system. The current pandemic of COVID-19 has allowed newer ways (with the help of newer technologies) to manage high-risk patients with T1D and DKA through telehealth and may result in lasting benefits to people with T1D.","Peters, Anne L; Garg, Satish K",Diabetes Technol Ther,,251

427546,Characterization of Aerosol Generation during Various Intensities of Exercise,2021,"Many customers today are more reliant on online shopping compared to the traditional shopping because of convenience afforded by online shopping platform. However, customers face many choices when using online shopping platform and need to imagine the product quality since it is online. Moreover, there are many problems of inconsistent service quality through online shopping. Therefore, online sellers need to understand customer preferences in order to survive in the competitive environment of online shopping. This study aims to identify the factors affecting customer acceptance of online shopping platform. Based on Technology Acceptance Model, and relevant studies concerning online platform preferred characteristics, a conceptual model is proposed. Seven independent variables (Website content, website design, perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use, trust, and customer service quality) are used to construct the model. To develop the variables’ measurements, the items were adopted from the related literature. The measurement model was validated by administrating a set of 200 questionnaires using convenience sampling to target online shopper respondents in Malaysia. Smart PLS3 tool was used to analyse the collected data. The result showed significance level of reliability and validity of the measurement model. The developed measurement can be used to examine the factors influencing the customer acceptance of online shopping. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Al-kumaim, N.

Numerous researchers and pharmaceutical companies are working on developing vaccines and treatments; however, a clear solution has yet to be found. The current study proposes the use of artificial intelligence methods to comprehend biomedical knowledge and infer the characteristics of COVID-19. A biomedical knowledge base was established via FastText, a word embedding technique, using PubMed literature from the past decade. Subsequently, a new knowledge base was created using recently published COVID-19 articles. Using this newly constructed knowledge base from the word embedding model, a list of anti-infective drugs and proteins of either human or coronavirus origin were inferred to be related, because they are located close to COVID-19 on the knowledge base. This study attempted to form a method to quickly infer related information about COVID-19 using the existing knowledge base, before sufficient knowledge about COVID-19 is accumulated. With COVID-19 not completely overcome, machine learning-based research in the PubMed literature will provide a broad guideline for researchers and pharmaceutical companies working on treatments for COVID-19.","Yang, Heyoung; Sohn, Eunsoo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,251

It is unknown whether these measures are associated with depression and anxiety. OBJECTIVES: To investigate meta-analytic global levels of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic and how the implementation of mitigation strategies (i.e. public transportation closures, stay-at-home orders, etc.) impacted such disorders. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, BIOSIS Citation Index, Current Content Connect, PsycINFO, CINAHL, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv databases for depression and anxiety prevalences; Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker for the containment and closure policies indexes; Global Burden of Disease Study for previous levels of depression and anxiety. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Original studies conducted during COVID-19 pandemic, which assessed categorical depression and anxiety, using PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales (cutoff â©¾10). PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: General population, healthcare providers, students, and patients. National physical distancing measures. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Meta-analysis and meta-regression. RESULTS: In total, 226 638 individuals were assessed within the 60 included studies. Global prevalence of both depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic was 24.0% and 21.3%, respectively. There were differences in the prevalence of both anxiety and depression reported across regions and countries. Asia (17.6% and 17.9%), and China (16.2% and 15.5%) especially, had the lowest prevalence of both disorders. Regarding the impact of mitigation strategies on mental health, only public transportation closures increased the prevalence of anxiety, especially in Europe. LIMITATIONS: Country-level data on physical distancing measures and previous anxiety/depression may not necessarily reflect local (i.e. city-specific) contexts. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Mental health concerns should not be viewed only as a delayed consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also as a concurrent epidemic. Our data provide support for policy-makers to consider real-time enhanced mental health services, and increase initiatives to foster positive mental health outcomes.","Castaldelli-Maia, João M; Marziali, Megan E; Lu, Ziyin; Martins, Silvia S",Psychol Med,,251

431368,Haemoperfusion should only be used for COVID-19 in the context of randomized trials,2020,"Journal impact factors, publication charges and assessment of quality and accuracy of scientific research are critical for researchers, managers, funders, policy makers, and society. Editors and publishers compete for impact factor rankings, to demonstrate how important their journals are, and researchers strive to publish in perceived top journals, despite high publication and access charges. This raises questions of how top journals are identified, whether assessments of impacts are accurate and whether high publication charges borne by the research community are justified, bearing in mind that they also collectively provide free peer-review to the publishers. Although traditional journals accelerated peer review and publication during the COVID-19 pandemic, preprint servers made a greater impact with over 30,000 open access articles becoming available and accelerating a trend already seen in other fields of research. We review and comment on the advantages and disadvantages of a range of assessment methods and the way in which they are used by researchers, managers, employers and publishers. We argue that new approaches to assessment are required to provide a realistic and comprehensive measure of the value of research and journals and we support open access publishing at a modest, affordable price to benefit research producers and consumers.","Triggle, Chris R; MacDonald, Ross; Triggle, David J; Grierson, Donald",Account Res,,251

Young adults who show few to no symptoms when infected have been identified in many countries as driving the virus' spread through unidentifiable community transmission. Mobile tracking technologies register nearby contacts of a user and notifies them if one later tests positive to the virus, potentially solving this issue; however, the effectiveness of these technologies depends on their acceptance by the public. The current study assessed attitudes towards three tracking technologies (telecommunication network tracking, a government app, and Apple and Google's Bluetooth exposure notification system) among four samples of young Taiwanese adults (aged 25 years or younger). Using Bayesian methods, we find high acceptance for all three tracking technologies (>75%), with acceptance for each technology surpassing 90% if additional privacy measures were included. We consider the policy implications of these results for Taiwan and similar cultures.","Garrett, Paul M; Wang, YuWen; White, Joshua P; Hsieh, Shulan; Strong, Carol; Lee, Yi-Chan; Lewandowsky, Stephan; Dennis, Simon; Yang, Cheng-Ta",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,251

The authors were given access to behavioral tracking data of a representative sample of 133,286 online casino gamblers by a large European online gambling operator with several online casino Swedish licenses. Online casino gambling activity utilizing daily cross-sectional data was examined over a 5-month period from January 1 to May 31 (2020). Results indicated that the (i) number of active online casino gamblers significantly increased over time, (ii) mean average amount of money bet by online casino gamblers daily significantly decreased over time, (iii) mean average daily bet by online casino gamblers at both the 90th and 99th percentiles significantly decreased over time, and (iv) mean average daily bet by online casino gamblers at the 10th and 25th percentiles significantly increased over time. The analysis also indicated that the number of high-risk players significantly decreased during the 5-month study period. While many different groups have claimed that gambling and problem gambling would increase during the pandemic due to more time being spent at home, evidence from the present study suggests that this is not the case because gambling intensity decreased, at least among Swedish gamblers.","Auer, Michael; Griffiths, Mark D",Int J Ment Health Addict,,251

The impact of the pandemic and related public health interventions on specialized psychiatric emergency services has not been described. These services provide high intensity care for severely ill patients who are likely to be homeless and underserved. OBJECTIVE: We describe the change in total volume and psychiatric hospitalization rates among three psychiatric emergency services across the United States. METHODS: Change in volumes and hospitalization were assessed for statistical significance using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous factors model from January 2018 to December 2020. RESULTS: The pandemic's impact on volumes and hospitalization varied by site. In Denver (CO), there was a statistically significant 9% decrease in overall volumes, although an 18% increase in hospitalizations was not significant. In New York City (NY), there was a significant 7% decrease in volumes as well as a significant 6% decrease in hospitalizations. In Portland (OR), volumes decreased by 4% and hospitalizations increased by 6% although differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: There has been a decrease in volume at these service after the pandemic, but there are substantial variations in the magnitude of change and demand for hospitalization by region. These findings suggest a need to understand where patients in crisis are seeking care and how systems of care must adapt to changing utilization in the pandemic era.","Simpson, Scott A; Loh, Ryan M; Cabrera, Maximilliam; Cahn, Megan; Gross, Anne; Hadley, Allison; Lawrence, Ryan E",,,251

438582,Colorectal Cancer Screening: Where We Are and Moving Forward,2020,"BACKGROUND: The economic, psychological, and social impact of pandemics and social distancing measures prompt the urgent need to determine the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), especially those considered most stringent such as stay-at-home and self-isolation mandates. This study focuses specifically on the impact of stay-at-home orders, both nationally and internationally, on the control of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an observational analysis from April to May 2020 and included both countries and US states with known stay-at-home orders. Our primary exposure was the time between the date of the first reported case of COVID-19 to an implemented stay-at-home mandate for each region. Our primary outcomes were the time from the first reported case to the highest number of daily cases and daily deaths. We conducted linear regression analyses, controlling for the case rate of the outbreak in each respective region. RESULTS: For countries and US states, a longer period of time between the first reported case and stay-at-home mandates was associated with a longer time to reach both the peak daily case and death counts. The largest effect was among regions classified as the latest 10% to implement a mandate, which in the US, predicted an extra 35.3 days (95% CI: 18.2, 52.5) to the peak number of cases, and 38.3 days (95% CI: 23.6, 53.0) to the peak number of deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the association between the timing of stay-at-home orders and the time to peak case and death counts for both countries and US states. Regions in which mandates were implemented late experienced a prolonged duration to reaching both peak daily case and death counts.","Medline, Alexandra; Hayes, Lamar; Valdez, Katia; Hayashi, Ami; Vahedi, Farnoosh; Capell, Will; Sonnenberg, Jake; Glick, Zoe; Klausner, Jeffrey D",BMC Public Health,,251

441577,Can pentoxifylline and similar xanthine derivatives find a niche in COVID-19 therapeutic strategies? A ray of hope in the midst of the pandemic. (Special Issue: Therapeutic targets and pharmacological treatment of COVID-19.),2020,"Background: Health care systems in the United States are continuously expanding and contracting spaces to treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in intensive care units (ICUs). As a result, hospitals must effectively decontaminate and contain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in constructed and deconstructed ICUs that care for patients with COVID-19. We assessed decontamination of a COVID-19 ICU and examined the containment efficacy of combined contact and droplet precautions in creating and maintaining a SARS-CoV-2-negative ICU ""antechamber"". Methods: To examine the efficacy of chemical decontamination, we used high-density, semi-quantitative environmental sampling to detect SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces in a COVID-19 ICU and COVID-19 ICU antechamber. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure viral RNA on surfaces. Viral location mapping revealed the distribution of viral RNA in the COVID-19 ICU and COVID-19 ICU antechamber. Results were further assessed using loop-mediated isothermal amplification. Results: We collected 224 surface samples pre-decontamination and 193 samples post-decontamination from a COVID-19 ICU and adjoining COVID-19 ICU antechamber. We found that 46% of antechamber objects were positive for SARS-CoV-2 pre-decontamination despite the construction of a swinging door barrier system, implementation of contact precautions, and installation of high-efficiency particulate air filters. The object positivity rate reduced to 32.1% and viral particle rate reduced by 95.4% following decontamination. Matched items had an average of 432.2 ± 2729 viral copies/cm2 pre-decontamination and 19.2 ± 118 viral copies/cm2 post-decontamination, demonstrating significantly reduced viral surface distribution (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Environmental sampling is an effective method for evaluating decontamination protocols and validating measures used to contain SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. While chemical decontamination effectively removes detectable viral RNA from surfaces, our approach to droplet/contact containment with an antechamber was not highly effective. These data suggest that hospitals should plan for the potential of aerosolized virions when creating strategies to contain SARS-CoV-2.","Brune, Zarina; Kuschner, Cyrus E; Mootz, Joseph; Davidson, Karina W; Pena, Robert C F; Ghanem, Mustafa H; Fischer, Austin; Gitman, Michael; Teperman, Lewis; Mason, Christopher; Becker, Lance B",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,251
441735,Inhibition of PDIA3 in club cells attenuates osteopontin production and lung fibrosis,2021,"Background: Containment of the coronavirus pandemic relied extensively on the combination of early implementation of quarantine and massive behavioral changes to ensure effectiveness. Decision-makers need to constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures implemented. Yet little is known about the factors influencing adherence and understanding of lockdown measures among the Palestinian community. This study aimed to assess the impact and factors affecting these early public health interventions. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional web-based questionnaire was distributed throughout social media (Facebook and Instagram). We used a snowball recruiting technique to target Palestinian adult citizens during the coronavirus pandemic quarantine between 6 and 16 April 2020, which corresponded to almost the middle interval of the strict massive lockdown measures in Palestine that lasted from 22 March to 5 May 2020. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed for the outcome variables (staying home adherence, in-home precautions adherence, and quarantine understanding). Results: Our questionnaire was completed by 2,819 participants. The mean (range) age was 29.47 (18-71) years. Of them, 1,144 (40.6%), 1,261 (44.7%), and 1,283 (45.5%) reported low levels of staying home adherence, in-home precautions adherence, and quarantine understanding, respectively. Females, city residents, those with higher educational levels, and those informed by official government sources were associated significantly with higher levels of both staying home adherence and quarantine understanding. Adequate food supply was associated with a higher level of staying home adherence. Higher levels of in-home precautions adherence were noticed in the elderly and those with a high-risk group living at home. Higher monthly income was inversely associated with higher levels of in-home precautions adherence and lower levels of quarantine understanding (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The socio-economic and financial status of the general population and coordination between the major information resources (official government), social media, and the press were the major factors affecting the community in regard to quarantine adherence. For maximum effectiveness and commitment levels amongst the people to decrease the spread of infection, policymakers need to address all those factors. In addition, clear communication between policymakers and the population is essential for reassuring the people and minimizing their fears regarding the unknown future.","Al Zabadi, Hamzeh; Yaseen, Noor; Alhroub, Thair; Haj-Yahya, Maryam",Front Public Health,,251

DESIGN: A case-control gender study performed from 2016 to 2019. METHODS: A gender and age matched-paired sample of 74 nurses was recruited and divided into men (n = 37) and women (n = 37). FFP3 filtering respirators and surgical masks fit factors were compared between male and female nurses by Mann-Whitney U tests. These measurements were tested to pass or fail according to the OSHA (&#8805;100) and AIHA (&#8805;50) criteria by Fisher exact tests for a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Global fit factor mean (standard deviation) was 2.86 (2.73) and 3.55 (6.34) for male and female nurses wearing surgical masks (p = .180), respectively, and nobody passed neither OSHA nor AIHA criteria (p = 1.00). Nevertheless, global fit factor were 30.82 (28.42) and 49.65 (43.04) for male and female nurses wearing FFP3 respirators, respectively, being significantly lower and worse in male nurses (p = .037). According to OSHA criteria, only 2.70% and 13.51% of male and females nurses, respectively, passed with non-significant difference (p = .199), meanwhile 21.62% and 48.64% of male and female nurses, respectively, passed AIHA criteria showing significant differences (p = .027) wearing FFP3 respirators. CONCLUSIONS: All male and female nurses wearing surgical masks failed to pass OSHA and AIHA criteria. Global fit factor of the proposed FFP3 filtering respirators was decreased and worse in male than female nurses. IMPACT: Our recommendation is to avoid surgical masks use for protective purposes and use the proposed FFP3 filtering respirators among nurses. Each nurse should be fit tested for its own respirator with special caution in male nurses due to their lower fit factor achieved and most of them failed to pass OSHA and AIHA criteria, especially during COVID-19 pandemic.","De-Yñigo-Mojado, Borja; Madera-García, Javier; Becerro-De-Bengoa-Vallejo, Ricardo; Losa-Iglesias, Marta E; Rodríguez-Sanz, David; Calvo-Lobo, Cesar; López-López, Daniel; Casado-Hernández, Israel; San-Antolín, Marta",J Adv Nurs,,251

High-throughput screening identified a small molecule, epi-enprioline that was able to induce apoptosis of vincristine-resistant neuroblastoma cells via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Epi-enprioline reduced tumour growth in multiple preclinical models, including an orthotopic neuroblastoma patient-derived xenograft model in vivo. In summary, our data suggest that epi-enprioline can be considered as a lead compound for the treatment of vincristine-resistant neuroblastoma uncovering a novel strategy, which can be further explored as a treatment for drug-resistant neuroblastoma.","Sime, Wondossen; Jemaà, Mohamed; Abassi, Yasmin; Lasorsa, Vito Alessandro; Bonne Køhler, Julie; Hansson, Karin; Bexell, Daniel; Michaelis, Martin; Cinatl, Jindrich; Strand, Daniel; Capasso, Mario; Massoumi, Ramin",,,251

Derangements in nutritional status, both for obesity and malnutrition, are relevant for the clinical outcome in acute illness. Systemic inflammation, immune system impairment, sarcopenia, and preexisting associated conditions, such as respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases related to obesity, could act as crucial factors linking nutritional status and the course and outcome of COVID-19. Nevertheless, vitamins and trace elements play an essential role in modulating immune response and inflammatory status. Overall, evaluation of the patient's nutritional status is not negligible for its implications on susceptibility, course, severity, and responsiveness to therapies, in order to perform a tailored nutritional intervention as an integral part of the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

Here, we present a structural snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 RTC as it transitions toward cap structure synthesis. We determine the atomic cryo-EM structure of an extended RTC assembled by nsp7-nsp82-nsp12-nsp132-RNA and a single RNA-binding protein, nsp9. Nsp9 binds tightly to nsp12 (RdRp) NiRAN, allowing nsp9 N terminus inserting into the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN, which then inhibits activity. We also show that nsp12 NiRAN possesses guanylyltransferase activity, catalyzing the formation of cap core structure (GpppA). The orientation of nsp13 that anchors the 5' extension of template RNA shows a remarkable conformational shift, resulting in zinc finger 3 of its ZBD inserting into a minor groove of paired template-primer RNA. These results reason an intermediate state of RTC toward mRNA synthesis, pave a way to understand the RTC architecture, and provide a target for antiviral development.","Yan, Liming; Ge, Ji; Zheng, Litao; Zhang, Ying; Gao, Yan; Wang, Tao; Huang, Yucen; Yang, Yunxiang; Gao, Shan; Li, Mingyu; Liu, Zhenyu; Wang, Haofeng; Li, Yingjian; Chen, Yu; Guddat, Luke W; Wang, Quan; Rao, Zihe; Lou, Zhiyong",Cell,,251

METHODS: We investigated nasopharyngeal swabs for respiratory viruses between March 2020 and February 2021 during the first year of pandemic in Turkey. We used QIAStat Dx Respiratory panel (Qiagen, Germany) in QIAStat Dx (Qiagen, Germany) for detection of respiratory viruses between March 2020 and February 2021. Respiratory panel kit included influenza A, B, influenza A H1N1, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza (PIV) 1,2,3,4, coronaviruses (CoVs) NL 63, 229E, OC43 and HKU1, human metapneumovirus (MPV) A/B, bocavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B and adenovirus. RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed the results of 319 nasopharyngeal swab samples. The average age of 199 (62.4%) male and 120 (37.6%) female patients between the ages of 0-92 was 16 years. We found that 101 (31.7%) samples were positive for viruses. Rhino/enteroviruses were the most common viruses in all age groups. Influenza positivity rate during the first year of pandemic declined to 2.3% from 17.3% among the previous year. MPV infection activity did not change during the pandemic. DISCUSSION: According to our findings we argue that epidemiology of respiratory viruses has changed during the pandemic period. Despite the current clinical focus on the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians should keep in mind that rhino/enterovirus and MPV infections may mimic COVID-19 and respiratory infections should be differentially diagnosed with rapid multiplex kits containing SARS-CoV-2, rhino/enterovirus and MPV.","Agca, Harun; Akalin, Halis; Saglik, Imran; Hacimustafaoglu, Mustafa; Celebi, Solmaz; Ener, Beyza",J Infect Public Health,,251

449443,Covid-19 vaccine acceptance: Beliefs and barriers associated with vaccination among the general population in india,2020,"Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), several reports have shown that fear relating to COVID-19 has sharply increased. To measure fear of COVID-19, various questionnaires have been developed in parallel. However, fear concerning COVID-19 is not necessarily a uniform construct and the different questionnaires may cover diverse aspects. To examine the underlying structure of fear of COVID-19, we conducted structural equation modelling and network analyses on four scales in an online convenience sample (N = 829). Particularly, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (Ahorsu et al., 2020), the Fear of the Coronavirus Questionnaire (Mertens et al., 2020), and the COVID Stress Scales (Taylor, Landry, Paluszek, Fergus et al., 2020, Taylor, Landry, Paluszek, Rachor et al., 2020) were included in our study, along with a new scale that also assessed socio-economic worries relating to COVID-19. We found that fear of COVID-19 was best classified into four clusters: Fear of health-related consequences, fear of supplies shortages and xenophobia, fear about socio-economic consequences, and symptoms of fear (e.g., compulsions, nightmares). We also find that a central cluster of items centered on fear of health, which likely represents the core of fear of COVID-19. These results help to characterize fear due to COVID-19 and inform future research.","Mertens, Gaëtan; Duijndam, Stefanie; Smeets, Tom; Lodder, Paul",J Anxiety Disord,,251

450223,New respirator performance monitor (RePM) for powered air-purifying respirators,2020,"BACKGROUND: Before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, medical students training in neurosurgery relied on external subinternships at institutions nationwide for immersive educational experiences and to increase their odds of matching. However, external rotations for the 2020-2021 cycle were suspended given concerns of spreading COVID-19. Our objective was to provide foundational neurosurgical knowledge expected of interns, bootcamp-style instruction in basic procedures, and preinterview networking opportunities for students in an accessible, virtual format. METHODS: The virtual neurosurgery course consisted of 16 biweekly 1-hour seminars over a 2-month period. Participants completed comprehensive precourse and postcourse surveys assessing their backgrounds, confidence in diverse neurosurgical concepts, and opinions of the qualities of the seminars. Responses from students completing both precourse and postcourse surveys were included. RESULTS: An average of 82 students participated live in each weekly lecture (range, 41-150). Thirty-two participants completed both surveys. On a 1-10 scale self-assessing baseline confidence in neurosurgical concepts, participants were most confident in neuroendocrinology (6.79 ± 0.31) and least confident in spine oncology (4.24 ± 0.44), with an average of 5.05 ± 0.32 across all topics. Quality ratings for all seminars were favorable. The mean postcourse confidence was 7.79 ± 0.19, representing an improvement of 3.13 ± 0.38 (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Feedback on seminar quality and improvements in confidence in neurosurgical topics suggest that an interactive virtual course may be an effective means of improving students' foundational neurosurgical knowledge and providing networking opportunities before application cycles. Comparison with in-person rotations when these are reestablished may help define roles for these tools.","Martini, Michael L; Yaeger, Kurt A; Kellner, Christopher P; Hadjipanayis, Constantinos; Shrivastava, Raj; Mocco, J; Morgenstern, Peter F",World Neurosurg,,251

However, a study of communication messages around COVID-19 in 15 West African countries showed a number of unfounded messages, as well as a lack of communication on critical information to understand the prevention measures being promoted. Incidents of violence that have taken place recently suggest that general mistrust and hostility could grow, similar to the events that occurred during the previous Ebola epidemics.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), reported as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor, is expressed in different human tissues (lung, intestine, and kidney) and in the testis, ovaries, uterus, and vagina. This suggests a potential risk to the human reproductive tract in COVID-19 patients. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in the blood, urine, facial/anal swabs, semen, and vaginal secretion, suggesting other potential means of transmission. However, little has been reported about SARS-CoV-2 infection in the male and nonpregnant female reproductive tracts, which may provide direct evidence on sexual transmission and fertility problems. Therefore, we focused this narrative review mainly on the distribution of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the male and nonpregnant female reproductive tracts, providing an overview of the potential threat of COVID-19 to reproductive health and sexual transmission.","Morelli, Fabrício; Meirelles, Lyvia E de F; de Souza, Maria V F; Mari, Natália L; Mesquita, Cristiane S S; Dartibale, Camila B; Damke, Gabrielle M Z F; Damke, Edilson; da Silva, Vânia R S; Souza, Raquel P; Consolaro, Marcia E L",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,251

However, IBD patients and patients taking immunosuppressive therapy were excluded from clinical phase III vaccine trials, complicating the assessment of effectiveness of these new vaccines. From past experience we know that adapted vaccination strategies may be appropriate in some IBD patients to optimize immunogenicity. We review current evidence on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination relevant to IBD patients, including immune responses from humoral to cellular, emerging data on new variants and off-label vaccination schemes. We also identify clinical and scientific knowledge gaps that can be translated into both large-scale population-based studies and targeted vaccine studies to describe the precise immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in IBD patients. We strongly endorse the recommendation of vaccinating IBD patients to ensure maximal protection from COVID-19 both for the individual and the community.","Wellens, Judith; Colombel, Jean-Frédéric; Satsangi, Jack J; Wong, Serre-Yu",J. crohns. colitis,,251

454406,Evaluation of non-clinical toxicity of extract and vouacapans from fruits of Pterodon pubescens Benth,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A tourniquet has been suggested as a useful means of reducing massive hemorrhage during myomectomy. However, it is not clear whether the restricted perfusion affects the ovaries. In the present study, we examined the effect of a tourniquet on ovarian reserve and blood loss during myomectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a randomized double-blind clinical trial, fertile nonobese patients scheduled for abdominal myomectomy at Rasool-e-Akram Hospital from February 2018 to June 2019 were randomized to a tourniquet (n = 46) or a non-tourniquet group (n = 35). Serum levels of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured before and 3 months after surgery, blood loss was recorded during surgery, and serum levels of hemoglobin (Hb) were recorded before surgery, 6 h and 3 days after surgery. SPSS version 21 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Demographic, obstetric, and myoma characteristics were similar in the 2 groups (p > 0.05). The mean baseline values of AMH and FSH did not differ between groups (p > 0.05). After surgery, only FSH was higher in the control group (p = 0.043). Despite the time taken to fasten and open the tourniquet, the mean operating time was shorter in the tourniquet group (p < 0.001). Blood loss was higher in the control group (p = 0.005). The drop in Hb levels at 6 h after surgery was higher in the non-tourniquet group (p = 0.002). Blood loss was significantly associated with the duration of surgery (r = 0.523, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The use of a tourniquet during abdominal myomectomy significantly reduced the mean volume of blood loss compared to the non-tourniquet group, while it did not prolong the duration of surgery, nor reduced the ovarian reserve. A tourniquet is a safe and efficient measure during abdominal myomectomy.","Mehdizadehkashi, Abolfazl; Tahermanesh, Kobra; Rokhgireh, Samaneh; Astaraei, Vahideh; Najmi, Zahra; Rakhshande, Mehrnoosh; Allahqoli, Leila; Ahmadi Pishkuhi, Mahin; Alkatout, Ibrahim; Chaichian, Shahla",Gynecol Obstet Invest,,251

Lockdown during COVID-19 pandemics substantially cleaned the air. The objective of this is to assess the effects of air cleaning due to lockdown on stress echocardiography (SE) results. We enrolled 19 patients with chronic coronary artery disease and/or heart failure referred to SE (semi-supine bicycle exercise, n = 8, or dipyridamole, n = 11). Before and soon after lockdown, we assessed regional wall motion abnormalities (abnormal value: worsening of &#8805; 2 segments), B-lines (a sign of pulmonary congestion, 4-site simplified scan, abnormal value &#8805; 2), and coronary flow velocity reserve in left anterior descending artery (CFVR, abnormal value < 2.0). Local air quality indicators (same day of SE) of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were obtained from publicly available data sets of the regional authority of environmental protection. After lockdown, NO2 concentration decreased from 19 ± 10 to 10 ± 4 µg/m3 (p = 0.006). After lockdown, abnormal responses remained unchanged for ischemia (21% vs 16%, p = ns) and decreased for B-lines (42% vs 5%, p = 0.008) and CFVR (84 vs 42%, p = 0.007). Changes in coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) were correlated to same-day variations in NO2 (r = -0.578, p = 0.010) and preceding 30-day changes in PM2.5 (r = -0.518, p = 0.023). After lockdown, air cleaning was associated with a beneficial effect on coronary small vessel dysfunction and alveolar-capillary barrier distress mirrored by improvement of CFVR and B-lines during SE in vulnerable patients.

455753,Environmental sustainability in neurointerventional procedures: a waste audit,2020,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease discovered in 2019 and currently in outbreak across the world. Lung injury with severe respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in COVID-19, brought by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there still lacks efficient treatment for COVID-19 induced lung injury and acute respiratory failure. Inhibition of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) caused by spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the most plausible mechanism of lung injury in COVID-19. We propose two candidate drugs, COL-3 (a chemically modified tetracycline) and CGP-60474 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), for treating lung injuries in COVID-19, based on their abilities to reverse the gene expression patterns in HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and in human COVID-19 patient lung tissues. Further bioinformatics analysis shows that twelve significantly enriched pathways (P-value<0.05) overlap between HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and human COVID-19 patient lung tissues, including signaling pathways known to be associated with lung injury such as TNF signaling, MAPK signaling and Chemokine signaling pathways. All these twelve pathways are targeted in COL-3 treated HCC515 cells, in which genes such as RHOA, RAC2, FAS, CDC42 have reduced expression. CGP-60474 shares eleven of twelve pathways with COL-3 with common target genes such as RHOA. It also uniquely targets genes related to lung injury, such as CALR and MMP14. In summary, this study shows that ACE2 inhibition is likely part of the mechanisms leading to lung injury in COVID-19, and that compounds such as COL-3 and CGP-60474 have the potential as repurposed drugs for its treatment.","He, Bing; Garmire, Lana",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14333v2.pdf,251

Continuing cancer surgery was a challenge faced by all. We present our experience on cancer surgery in a cancer centre with high volume of patients and limited resources during early pandemic. Methods: We retrospectively analysed our operation theatre database on surgery and anaesthesia from 1st April to 30th June 2020. Results: A total of 457 surgeries were done-complex major, major, intermediate and minor surgeries constituted 43%, 25%, 12% and 20%, respectively. Median age of patient was 50 years, and 76% were below 60. The median ASA class was I (I-IV), and 97% were ASA I and II. The median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score was 0 (0-3), and 92% had score 0 and 1. Major cases done under regional anaesthesia were 30.7%. Median length of intensive care unit stay was 1 (1-6) days, and length of hospital stay was 7 (7-15) days. Clavien-Dindo Grade II complication in patients above 60 years was 16.4% and below 60 years was 17.6% (p = 0.76). 10% in ASA I compared to 26% of ASA II (p = 0.00) and 15.9% with ECOG 0 and 1 compared to 30.9% with ECOG 3 and 4 (p = 0.01) had grade II complication. Four (1%) patients had Grade &#8805; III CD complication. Covid testing was undertaken in 52% patients pre-operatively, and there was no positive case in post-operative period.

It is well known that Kawasaki disease is one of the most common causes of acquired heart diseases in children in the developed countries. Many studies, have suggested that heterogeneous infectious agents, such as common viruses, may trigger Kawasaki disease in young children with genetic background. Nowadays we are facing a pandemic caused by a Novel Coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, it could be possible that once exposed to this new coronavirus, some children, genetically predisposed, may mount an exaggerated inflammatory response which clinically manifests as Kawasaki Disease. METHODS: from January to May 2020 a systematic search was performed on Pubmed for the following search terms: ""COVID-19"", ""children"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""complications"", ""Kawasaki disease"", ""cytokine storm"". RESULTS: Usually, infants and children present milder symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 disease with a better outcome than adults. At variance, some children may be genetically disposed to a more robust inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, similar to Kawasaki disease. In fact, Kawasaki disease is the result of an abnormal immune response, in susceptible children, to an external trigger such as an infection. Thus, according to the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease, paediatricians may expect an increase in cases of Kawasaki disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cavallo, Federica; Chiarelli, Francesco",Acta Biomed,,251
458280,"A deliberate path toward diversity, equity, and inclusion within the ASCI",2020,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) starting last December in China placed emphasis on liver involvement during infection. This review discusses the underlying mechanisms linking COVID-19 to liver dysfunction, according to recent available information, while waiting further studies. The manifestations of liver damage are usually mild (moderately elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase activities), and generally asymptomatic. Few patients can still develop severe liver problems, and therapeutic options can be limited. Liver dysfunction may affect about one-third of the patients, with prevalence greater in men than women, and in elderly. Mechanisms of damage are complex and include direct cholangiocyte damage and other coexisting conditions such as the use of antiviral drugs, systemic inflammatory response, respiratory distress syndrome-induced hypoxia, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction. During new COVID-19 infections, liver injury may be observed. If liver involvement appears during COVID-19 infection, however, attention is required. This is particularly true if patients are older or have a pre-existing history of liver diseases. During COVID-19 infection, the onset of liver damage impairs the prognosis, and hospital stay is longer.","Portincasa, Piero; Krawczyk, Marcin; Machill, Antonia; Lammert, Frank; Di Ciaula, Agostino",Eur J Intern Med,,251

459864,Mini-Review Discussing the Reliability and Efficiency of COVID-19 Vaccines,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced drastic changes to daily life, from the implementation of stay-at-home orders to mandating facial coverings and limiting in-person gatherings. While the relaxation of these control measures has varied geographically, it is widely agreed that contact tracing efforts will play a major role in the successful reopening of businesses and schools. As the volume of positive cases has increased in the United States, it has become clear that there is room for digital health interventions to assist in contact tracing. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of a mobile-friendly app designed to supplement manual COVID-19 contact tracing efforts on a university campus. Here, we present the results of a development and validation study centered around the use of the MyCOVIDKey app on the Vanderbilt University campus during the summer of 2020. METHODS: We performed a 6-week pilot study in the Stevenson Center Science and Engineering Complex on Vanderbilt University's campus in Nashville, TN. Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty, and staff >18 years who worked in Stevenson Center and had access to a mobile phone were eligible to register for a MyCOVIDKey account. All users were encouraged to complete regular self-assessments of COVID-19 risk and to key in to sites by scanning a location-specific barcode. RESULTS: Between June 17, 2020, and July 29, 2020, 45 unique participants created MyCOVIDKey accounts. These users performed 227 self-assessments and 1410 key-ins. Self-assessments were performed by 89% (n=40) of users, 71% (n=32) of users keyed in, and 48 unique locations (of 71 possible locations) were visited. Overall, 89% (202/227) of assessments were determined to be low risk (ie, asymptomatic with no known exposures), and these assessments yielded a CLEAR status. The remaining self-assessments received a status of NOT CLEAR, indicating either risk of exposure or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (7.5% [n=17] and 3.5% [n=8] of self-assessments indicated moderate and high risk, respectively). These 25 instances came from 8 unique users, and in 19 of these instances, the at-risk user keyed in to a location on campus. CONCLUSIONS: Digital contact tracing tools may be useful in assisting organizations to identify persons at risk of COVID-19 through contact tracing, or in locating places that may need to be cleaned or disinfected after being visited by an index case. Incentives to continue the use of such tools can improve uptake, and their continued usage increases utility to both organizational and public health efforts. Parameters of digital tools, including MyCOVIDKey, should ideally be optimized to supplement existing contact tracing efforts. These tools represent a critical addition to manual contact tracing efforts during reopening and sustained regular activity.","Scherr, Thomas Foster; Hardcastle, Austin N; Moore, Carson Paige; DeSousa, Jenna Maria; Wright, David Wilson",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,251

460304,Financial Toxicity in Patients With Cancer: What a Tangled Web We Weave,2021,"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care ultrasonography (PoCUS) is increasingly used across the medical field. PoCUS is also being implemented in general practice despite a lack of clinical guidelines and training programs for general practitioners (GPs). OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to elucidate the employment of PoCUS by Danish GPs following a short training program. METHODS: Thirty GPs were enrolled in a short ultrasound training program and taught how to perform 22 selected scanning modalities. In the following 3 months, the GPs registered all performed PoCUS examinations according to the Audit Project Odense method. After 5 months, the GPs were invited to participate in an evaluation seminar, where questionnaires were distributed. RESULTS: During the registration period, 1598 patients were examined with PoCUS. A total of 1948 scanning modalities were registered, including 207 examinations outside the taught curriculum. The majority of the ultrasound examinations were performed within 10 minutes (89%), most were considered to be conclusive (87%) and/or to increase diagnostic certainty (67%), whereas one in four examinations entailed a change in patient management. Most GPs attending the evaluation seminar continued to use PoCUS and found the scanning modalities included in the course curriculum relevant in their daily work. CONCLUSION: The GPs found several indications for performing PoCUS following the attendance of a 2-day basic training program.

Here we aimed to investigate the clinical and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases. We collected and analyzed the clinical data of 172 hospitalized cases of COVID-19 who were diagnosed via qRT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs during January 2020 and February 2020. The chest images were reviewed by radiologists and respirologists. The older patients with COVID-19 in Henan Province had more severe disease and worse prognosis. The male sex, smoking history and Wuhan exposure of patients are not related to the severity or prognosis of COVID-19. Family gatherings were showed among 26.7% of patients. A greater proportion of patients in the severe group suffer from combined chronic diseases. CT results showed that most patients had bilateral lung lesions and multiple lung lobes. The lungs of severe patients are more damaged. Both the infection range and inflammatory factor levels are related to the poor prognosis. Antiviral drugs, immunoglobulin and traditional Chinese medicine are mainly used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The discharge rate of COVID-19 patients was 93.0%, and the mortality rate was 2.3%. Case type, lymphocyte ratio grade, and respiratory failure at admission are risk factors for poor prognosis, except for the number of infiltrating lung lobes. The results showed that severe disease process, lymphopenia and respiratory failure are risk factors for the COVID-19.","Zhang, Qianqian; Wang, Zheng; Lv, Yanping; Zhao, Jiang; Dang, Qiang; Xu, Dongfeng; Zhao, Dongxiang; Liu, Haiyang; Wang, Ziqi; Zhao, Xingru; Xu, Zhiwei; Zhang, Xiaoju",Hum Cell,,251
460941,"Neutrophils and COVID-19: Nots, NETs, and knots",2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has challenged healthcare system capacities and safety for health care workers, reshaping doctor-patient interaction favoring e-Health or telemedicine. The pandemic situation may make difficult to prioritize patients with allergies diseases (AD), face-to-face evaluation, and moreover concern about the possible COVID-19 diagnosis, since COVID-19 shared many symptoms in common with AD. Being COVID-19 a novel disease, everyone is susceptible; there are some advances on vaccine and specific treatment. We evaluate existing literature on allergic diseases (AD): allergic rhinitis, asthma, food allergy, drug allergy, and skin allergy, and potential underlying mechanisms for any interrelationship between AD and COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: There is inconclusive and controversial evidence of the association between AD and the risk of adverse clinical outcomes of COVID-19. AD patients should minimize hospital and face-to-face visits, and those who have used biologics and allergen immunotherapy should continue the treatment. It is essential to wear personal protective equipment for the protection of health care workers. Social distancing, rational use of facemasks, eye protection, and hand disinfection for health care workers and patients deserve further attention and promotion. Teleconsultation during COVID-19 times for AD patients is very encouraging and telemedicine platform can provide a reliable service in patient care.","Izquierdo-Domínguez, Adriana; Rojas-Lechuga, María Jesús; Alobid, Isam",Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,,251
461758,Emerging therapeutic approaches to COVID-19,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic, induced by the novel Coronavirus worldwide outbreak, is causing countries to introduce different types of lockdown measures to curb the contagion. The implementation of strict lockdown policies has had unprecedented impacts on air quality globally. This study is an attempt to assess the effects of COVID-19 induced lockdown measures on air quality in both regional, country, and city scales in the South and Southeast Asian region using open-source satellite-based data and software frameworks. We performed a systematic review of the national lockdown measures of 19 countries of the study area based on publicly available materials. We considered two temporal settings over a period of 66 days to assess and compare the effects of lockdown measures on air quality levels between standard business as usual and current situation COVID-19 lockdown. Results showed that compared to the same period of 2019, atmospheric NO2, SO2, PM2.5, and CO levels decreased by an average of 24.16%, 19.51%, 20.25%, and 6.88%, respectively during the lockdown, while O3 increased by a maximum of 4.52%. Among the 19 studied cities, Dhaka, Kathmandu, Jakarta, and Hanoi experienced the highest reduction of NO2 (40%-47%) during the lockdown period compared to the corresponding period of 2019. The methodological framework applied in this study can be used and extended to future research in the similar domain such as understanding long-term effects of COVID-19 mitigation measures on the atmospheric pollution at continental-scale or assessing the effects of the domestic emissions during the stay-at-home; a standard and effective COVID-19 lockdown measure applied in most of the countries.","Roy, Sanjoy; Saha, Monojit; Dhar, Bandhan; Pandit, Santa; Nasrin, Rubaiya",Sci Total Environ,,251

Recommendations for protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been published by the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and the European Society of Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Nurses and Associates (ESGENA). Separate endoscopy rooms for high-risk patients and negative pressure rooms should be included in the planning of future endoscopy unit projects. It is unclear whether a continuing prioritization of gastroenterological services after the first wave of COVID-19 is necessary in the future. The report of the Scientific Institute of the AOK health insurance company (WldO) and surveys of the Working Group of Clinical Gastroenterologists (ALGK) and the Professional Association of Private Gastroenterologists in Germany (bng) demonstrated that the coronavirus lockdown led to a significant reduction of gastrointestinal diseases and gastroenterological services including screening colonoscopy. It is likely that the reduction of the overcapacity of the German healthcare system will also be continued by reduction of inpatient services after the corona pandemic has been overcome. It is essential to keep the medical profession attractive for young colleagues. The high rates of burnout and suicide and the difficult compatibility with the requirements of a life balance are alarm signals that have to be solved.","Frieling, Thomas",Gastroenterologe,,251

462984,Can Zn Be a Critical Element in COVID-19 Treatment?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic performance of chest CT in screening patients suspected of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Western population. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent chest CT because of clinical suspicion of COVID-19 were included. CT scans were prospectively evaluated by frontline general radiologists who were on duty at the time when the CT scan was performed and retrospectively assessed by a chest radiologist in an independent and blinded manner. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used as reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Sensitivity and specificity of the frontline general radiologists were compared to those of the chest radiologist using the McNemar test. RESULTS: 56 patients were included. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for the frontline general radiologists were 89.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 71.8%, 97.7%], 32.1% (95% CI: 15.9%, 52.4%), 56.8% (95% CI: 41.0%, 71.7%), and 75.0% (95% CI: 42.8%, 94.5%), respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for the chest radiologist were 89.3% (95% CI: 71.8%, 97.7%), 75.0% (95% CI: 55.1%, 89.3%), 78.1% (95% CI: 60.0%, 90.7%), and 87.5% (95% CI: 67.6%, 97.3%), respectively. Sensitivity was not significantly different (p = 1.000), but specificity was significantly higher for the chest radiologist (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Chest CT interpreted by frontline general radiologists achieves insufficient screening performance. Although specificity of a chest radiologist appears to be significantly higher, sensitivity did not improve. A negative chest CT result does not exclude COVID-19. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Our study shows that chest CT interpreted by frontline general radiologists achieves insufficient diagnostic performance to use it as an independent screening tool for COVID-19. Although specificity of a chest radiologist appears to be significantly higher, sensitivity is still insufficiently high.","Krdzalic, Jasenko; de Jaegere, Tom M H; Kwee, Robert M",Br J Radiol,,251

This study investigated the effects of selected air pollutants and meteorological variables on daily COVID-19 cases in Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Air pollutants and meteorological data for Dhaka city were collected from 8 April to 16 June 2020 from multiple sources. This study implied spearman’s correlation to see the correlation between daily COVID-19 cases and different air pollutants and meteorological variables. Besides, multiple linear regression and the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) were used to investigate the association between COVID-19 cases and other variables used in this study. Due to lockdown measures, significant differences between PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 in 2019 and 2020 were observed in Dhaka city. We used lag-0, lag-7, lag-14, and lag-21 days on daily COVID-19 cases to look at the lag effect of different air pollutants and meteorology. The LRM results showed that the daily COVID-19 cases are significantly correlated with relative humidity (lag-0 days) and pressure (lag-14 days) (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, the GAM model results showed a significant nonlinear association among daily COVID-19 cases and meteorology and air quality variables on different lag days. Therefore, our results suggest that an effective public health intervention measures should be implemented to slowdown the spreading of COVID-19. © The Author(s).","Islam, M.

The aim of this study was to analyze genotype frequencies of five common polymorphisms of cytochromes P450 in Roma/Gypsy and Czech (non-Roma) population samples with Czech origin. Methods Roma/Gypsy (n=302) and Czech subjects (n=298) were genotyped for CYP1A2 (rs762551), CYP2A6 (rs4105144), CYP2B6 (rs3745274) and CYP2D6 (rs3892097; rs1065852) polymorphisms using PCR-RFLP or Taqman assay. Results We found significant allelic/genotype differences between ethnics in three genes. For rs3745274 polymorphism, there was increased frequency of T allele carriers in Roma in comparison with Czech population (53.1 vs. 43.7%; p=0.02). For rs4105144 (CYP2A6) there was higher frequency of T allele carriers in Roma in comparison with Czech population (68.7 vs. 49.8%; p<0.0001). For rs3892097 (CYP2D6) there was more carriers of the A allele between Roma in comparison with Czech population (39.2 vs. 38.2%; p=0.048). Genotype/allelic frequencies of CYP2D6 (rs1065852) and CYP1A2 (rs762551) variants did not significantly differ between the ethnics. Conclusions There were significant differences in allelic/genotype frequencies of some, but not all cytochromes P450 polymorphisms between the Czech Roma/Gypsies and Czech non-Roma subjects.","Dlouhá, Lucie; Adámková, Vera; Sedová, Lenka; Olisarová, Vera; Hubácek, Jaroslav A; Tóthová, Valérie",Drug Metab.

465204,A Paradigm Shift in Radiation Oncology Training,2020,"Kidney transplant recipients who develop symptoms consistent with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are bringing unique challenges to health care professionals. Telemedicine has surged dramatically since the pandemic in effort to maintain patient care and reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure to patients, health care workers, and the public. Herein we present reports of 3 kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 who were managed using telemedicine via synchronous video visits integrated with an electronic medical record system, from home to inpatient settings. We demonstrate how telemedicine helped assess, diagnose, triage, and treat patients with COVID-19 while avoiding a visit to an emergency department or outpatient clinic. While there is limited information about the duration of viral shedding for immunosuppressed patients, our findings underscore the importance of using telemedicine in the follow-up care for kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 who have recovered from symptoms but might have persistently positive nucleic acid tests. Our experience emphasizes the opportunities of telemedicine in the management of kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 and in the maintenance of uninterrupted follow-up care for such immunosuppressed patients with prolonged viral shedding. Telemedicine may help increase access to care for kidney transplant recipients during and beyond the pandemic as it offers a prompt, safe, and convenient platform in the delivery of care for these patients. Yet, to advance the practice of telemedicine in the field of kidney transplantation, barriers to increasing the widespread implementation of telemedicine should be removed, and research studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of telemedicine in the care of kidney transplant recipients.","Abuzeineh, Mohammad; Muzaale, Abimereki D; Crews, Deidra C; Avery, Robin K; Brotman, Daniel J; Brennan, Daniel C; Segev, Dorry L; Al Ammary, Fawaz",Transplant. proc,,251

We assessed whether seasonal respiratory illness patterns changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We categorized emergency department (ED) visits reported to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program according to chief complaints and diagnosis codes, excluding visits with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections. For each week during March 1, 2020 through December 26, 2020 (""pandemic period""), we compared the proportion of ED visits in each respiratory category with the proportion of visits in that category during the corresponding weeks of 2017-2019 (""pre-pandemic period""). We analyzed positivity of respiratory viral tests from two independent clinical laboratories. RESULTS: During March 2020, cough, shortness of breath, and influenza-like illness accounted for twice as many ED visits compared with the pre-pandemic period. During the last four months of 2020, all respiratory conditions, except shortness of breath, accounted for a smaller proportion of ED visits than during the pre-pandemic period. Percent positivity for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses, and human metapneumovirus were lower in 2020 than 2019. Although test volume decreased, percent positivity was higher for rhinovirus/enterovirus during the final weeks of 2020 compared with 2019; with ED visits similar to the pre-pandemic period. DISCUSSION: Broad reductions in respiratory test positivity and respiratory emergency department visits (excluding COVID-19) occurred during 2020. Interventions for mitigating spread of SARS-CoV-2 likely also reduced transmission of other pathogens. Timely surveillance is needed to understand community health threats, particularly when current trends deviate from seasonal norms.","Rodgers, Loren; Sheppard, Michael; Smith, Amanda; Dietz, Stephanie; Jayanthi, Praveena; Yuan, Yan; Bull, Lara; Wotiz, Samantha; Schwarze, Tessa; Azondekon, Roseric; Hartnett, Kathleen; Adjemian, Jennifer; Kirking, Hannah L; Kite Powell, Aaron",Clin. infect. dis,,251

469389,Issue highlights,2021,"Nitrogen (N) is a critical component of food security, economy and planetary health. Human production of reactive nitrogen (Nr) via Haber-Bosch process and cultivation-induced biological N2 fixation (BNF) has doubled global N cycling over the last century. The most important beneficial effect of Nr is augmenting global food supplies due to increased crop yields. However, increased circulation of Nr in the environment is responsible for serious human health effects such as methemoglobinemia (""blue baby syndrome"") and eutrophication of coastal and inland waters. Furthermore, ammonia (NH3) emission mainly from farming and animal husbandary impacts not only human health causing chronic lung disease, inflammation of human airways and irritation of eyes, sinuses and skin but is also involved in the formation of secondary particulate matter (PM) that plays a critical role in environment and human health. Nr also affects human health via global warming, depletion of stratospheric ozone layer resulting in greater intensity of ultra violet B rays (UVB) on the Earth's surface, and creation of ground-level ozone (through reaction of NO2 with O2). The consequential indirect human health effects of Nr include the spread of vector-borne pathogens, increased incidence of skin cancer, development of cataracts, and serious respiratory diseases, besides land degradation. Evidently, the strategies to reduce Nr and mitigate adverse environmental and human health impacts include plugging pathways of nitrogen transport and loss through runoff, leaching and emissions of NH3, nitrogen oxides (NO x ), and other N compounds; improving fertilizer N use efficiency; reducing regional disparity in access to N fertilizers; enhancing BNF to decrease dependence on chemical fertilizers; replacing animal-based proteins with plant-based proteins; adopting improved methods of livestock raising and manure management; reducing air pollution and secondary PM formation; and subjecting industrial and vehicular NO x emission to pollution control laws. Strategic implementation of all these presents a major challenge across the fields of agriculture, ecology and public health. Recent observations on the reduction of air pollution in the COVID-19 lockdown period in several world regions provide an insight into the achievability of long-term air quality improvement. In this review, we focus on complex relationships between Nr and human health, highlighting a wide range of beneficial and detrimental effects.","Nieder, Rolf; Benbi, Dinesh K",Rev. environ. health,,251

469774,Contribution to the discussion of AIDS and Covid-19: A tale of two pandemics and the role of statisticians by Ellenberg and Morris,2021,"As the world grapples with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a particularly thorny set of questions surrounds the reopening of primary and secondary (K-12) schools. The benefits of in-person learning are numerous, in terms of education quality, mental health, emotional well-being, equity and access to food and shelter. Early reports suggested that children might have reduced susceptibility to COVID-19, and children have been shown to experience fewer complications than older adults. Over the past few months, our understanding of COVID-19 has been further shaped by emerging data, and it is now understood that children are as susceptible to infection as adults and have a similar viral load during infection, even if asymptomatic. Based on this updated understanding of the disease, we have used epidemiological modeling to explore the feasibility and consequences of school reopening in the face of differing rates of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission. We focused our analysis on the United States, but the results are applicable to other countries as well. We demonstrate the potential for a large discrepancy between detected cases and true infections in schools due to the combination of high asymptomatic rates in children coupled with delays in seeking testing and receiving results from diagnostic tests. Our findings indicate that, regardless of the initial prevalence of the disease, and in the absence of robust surveillance testing and contact-tracing, most schools in the United States can expect to remain open for 20-60 days without the emergence of sizeable disease clusters. At this point, even if schools choose to close after outbreaks occur, COVID-19 cases will be seeded from these school clusters and amplified into the community. Thus, our findings suggest that the debate between the risks to student safety and benefits of in-person learning frames a false dual choice. Reopening schools without surveillance testing and contact tracing measures in place will lead to spread within the schools and within the communities that eventually forces a return to remote learning and leaves a trail of infection in its wake.","Johnson, Kaitlyn E; Stoddard, Madison; Nolan, Ryan P; White, Douglas E; Hochberg, Natasha S; Chakravarty, Arijit",PLoS One,,251

470977,A prospective clinical trial evaluating changes in the wound microenvironment in patients with chronic venous leg ulcers treated with a hypothermically stored amniotic membrane,2021,"BACKGROUND: During infectious epidemics, healthcare workers are required to deliver traditional care while facing new pressures. Time and resource restrictions, a focus on saving lives and new safety measures can lead to traditional aspects of care delivery being neglected. AIM: Identify barriers to delivering end-of-life care, describe attempts to deliver care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and understand the impact this had on staff. DESIGN: A rapid appraisal was conducted incorporating a rapid review of policies from the United Kingdom, semi-structured telephone interviews with healthcare workers, and a review of mass print media news stories and social media posts describing healthcare worker's experiences of delivering care during the pandemic. Data were coded and analysed using framework analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: From a larger ongoing study, 22 interviews which mentioned death or caring for patients at end-of-life, eight government and National Health Service policies affecting end-of-life care delivery, eight international news media stories and 3440 publicly available social media posts were identified. The social media analysis centred around 274 original tweets with the highest reach, engagement and relevance. Incorporating multiple workstreams provided a broad perspective of end-of-life care during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Three themes were developed: (1) restrictions to traditional care, (2) striving for new forms of care and (3) establishing identity and resilience. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic prohibited the delivery of traditional care as practical barriers restricted human connections. Staff prioritised communication and comfort orientated tasks to re-establish compassion at end-of-life and displayed resilience by adjusting their goals.","Mitchinson, Lucy; Dowrick, Anna; Buck, Caroline; Hoernke, Katarina; Martin, Sam; Vanderslott, Samantha; Robinson, Hannah; Rankl, Felicia; Manby, Louisa; Lewis-Jackson, Sasha; Vindrola-Padros, Cecilia",Palliat Med,,251

The impact of COVID-19 across an entire country with a high infection rate is yet to be explored. METHODS: The study uses data from 8629 cases recorded in two time-series (2017/2018 and 2020) of the Spanish national registry. Data from a non-COVID-19 period and the COVID-19 period (February 1st-April 30th 2020) were compared. During the COVID-19 period, data a further analysis comparing non-pandemic and pandemic weeks (defined according to the WHO declaration on March 11th, 2020) was conducted. The chi-squared analysis examined differences in OHCA attendance and other patient and resuscitation characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression examined survival likelihood to hospital admission and discharge. The multilevel analysis examined the differential effects of regional COVID-19 incidence on these same outcomes. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 period, the incidence of resuscitation attempts declined and survival to hospital admission (ORâ¯=â¯1.72; 95%CIâ¯=â¯1.46-2.04; pâ¯<â¯0.001) and discharge (ORâ¯=â¯1.38; 95%CIâ¯=â¯1.07-1.78; pâ¯=â¯0.013) fell compared to the non-COVID period. This pattern was also observed when comparing non-pandemic weeks and pandemic weeks. COVID-19 incidence impinged significantly upon outcomes regardless of regional variation, with low, medium, and high incidence regions equally affected. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic, irrespective of its incidence, seems to have particularly impeded the pre-hospital phase of OHCA care. Present findings call for the need to adapt out-of-hospital care for periods of serious infection risk.

Remotely delivered therapy could be of particular benefit for people with social anxiety disorder (SAD), who tend to avoid or delay seeking face-to-face therapy, often due to anxiety about travelling to appointments and meeting mental health professionals in person. Individual cognitive therapy for SAD (CT-SAD), based on the Clark and Wells (1995) model, is a highly effective treatment that is recommended as a first line intervention in NICE Guidance (NICE, 2013). All of the key features of face-to-face CT-SAD; including video feedback, attention training, behavioural experiments, and memory focused techniques can be adapted for remote delivery. In this paper, we provide guidance for clinicians on how to deliver CT-SAD remotely, and suggest novel ways for therapists and patients to overcome the challenges of carrying out a range of behavioural experiments during remote treatment delivery.","Warnock-Parkes, Emma; Wild, Jennifer; Thew, Graham R.; Kerr, Alice; Grey, Nick; Stott, Richard; Ehlers, Anke; Clark, David M.",Cogn.

472698,We all breathe the same air and we are all mortal,2020,"AIMS: We here investigated the effect of late- and post-ictal treatment with rottlerin, a polyphenol compound isolated from Mallotus philippinensis, on delayed apoptotic neuronal death induced by trimethyltin (TMT) in mice. MAIN METHODS: Male C57BL/6N mice received a single injection of TMT (2.4â¯mg/kg, i.p.), and mice were treated with rottlerin after a peak time (i.e., 2 d post-TMT) of convulsive behaviors and apoptotic cell death (5.0â¯mg/kg, i.p. at 3 and 4 d after TMT injection). Object location test and tail suspension test were performed at 5 d after TMT injection. In addition, changes in the expression of apoptotic and neurogenic markers in the dentate gyrus were examined. KEY FINDINGS: Late- and post-ictal treatment with rottlerin suppressed delayed neuronal apoptosis in the dentate gyrus, and attenuated memory impairments (as evaluated by object location test) and depression-like behaviors (as evaluated by tail suspension test) at 5â¯days after TMT injection in mice. In addition, rottlerin enhanced the expression of Sox2 and DCX, and facilitated p-ERK expression in BrdU-incorporated cells in the dentate gyrus of TMT-treated mice. Rottlerin also increased p-Akt expression, and attenuated the increase in the ratio of pro-apoptotic factors/anti-apoptotic factors, and consequent cytosolic cytochrome c release and caspase-3 cleavage. Rottlerin-mediated action was significantly reversed by SL327, an ERK inhibitor. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that late- and post-ictal treatment with rottlerin attenuates TMT-induced delayed neuronal apoptosis in the dentate gyrus of mice via promotion of neurogenesis and inhibition of an on-going apoptotic process through up-regulation of p-ERK.","Hwang, Yeonggwang; Kim, Hyoung-Chun; Shin, Eun-Joo",Life Sci,,251

Medical students are often exposed to higher levels of distress, which may lead to a higher prevalence of psychoactive substance use and psychiatric co-morbidities. Alcohol abuse can be one of the detrimental methods of coping with distress. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of alcohol use among medical students in Poland. METHODS: We analyzed data from the POLLEK cohort study on alcohol consumption and possible influencing factors. RESULTS: Among the 540 students included, 167 (30.9%) were hazardous drinkers (HAZ) according to the AUDIT test. The main identified risk factors of hazardous/harmful drinking were male gender and smoking cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS: Given the fairly widespread alcohol abuse among medical students, it is necessary to implement screening (and intervention in the next stage) programs in these groups.","Gajda, Maksymilian; Sedlaczek, Katarzyna; Szemik, Szymon; Kowalska, Malgorzata",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,251

We use knowledge state networks - specific neural networks trained on assessment data of previous learners - to predict the full knowledge state of other learners from only partial information about their skills. In combination with a matching assessment strategy for asking discriminative questions we demonstrate that our approach leads to a significant speed-up of the assessment process - in terms of the necessary number of assessment questions - in comparison to standard assessment designs.

METHODS: A nationwide ecologic study based on open-sourced, anonymized, aggregated data provided by the Israel Ministry of Health. The correlations between municipal SES, vaccination percentage and active COVID-19 cases during the vaccination campaign were analysed by using weighted Pearson correlations. To assess the adequacy of first dose vaccination rollout relative to the municipality COVID-19 disease burden, a metric termed the vaccination need ratio was devised by dividing the total number of active cases (per 10 000 people) by the vaccination percentage of the population over 60 in each municipality, and its correlation with the SES was examined. RESULTS: 23 days after initiation of the vaccination campaign, 760 916 (56.8%) individuals over the age of 60 were vaccinated in Israel with the first dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. A negative correlation was found between the COVID-19 active case burden and the vaccination percentage of the study population in each municipality (r = -0.47, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.30). The vaccination percentage significantly correlated with the municipal SES (r = 0.83, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.87). This finding persisted but was attenuated over a 5-week period. A negative correlation between the vaccination need ratio and municipal SES (r = -0.80, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.66) was found. DISCUSSION: Lower COVID-19 vaccination percentage was associated with lower SES and high active disease burden. Vaccination efforts should focus on areas with lower SES and high disease burden to assure equality of vaccine allocation and potentially provide a more diligent disease mitigation.","Caspi, Gil; Dayan, Avshalom; Eshal, Yael; Liverant-Taub, Sigal; Twig, Gilad; Shalit, Uri; Lewis, Yair; Shina, Avi; Caspi, Oren",Clin. microbiol. infect,,251

478624,French Pandemic Resistance,2020,"BACKGROUND: The successful completion of medical practices often relies on information collection and analysis. Government agencies and medical institutions have encouraged people to use medical information technology (MIT) to manage their conditions and promote personal health. In 2014, Taiwan established the first electronic personal health record (PHR) platform, My Health Bank (MHB), which allows people to access and manage their PHRs at any time. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Taiwan has used MIT to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19 and undertaken various prevention measures before the onset of the outbreak. Using MHB to purchase masks in an efficient and orderly way and thoroughly implementing personal protection efforts is highly important to contain disease spread. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand people's intention to use the electronic PHR platform MHB and to investigate the factors affecting their intention to use this platform. METHODS: From March 31 to April 9, 2014, in a promotion via email and Facebook, participants were asked to fill out a structured questionnaire after watching an introductory video about MHB on YouTube. The questionnaire included seven dimensions: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, health literacy, privacy and security, computer self-efficacy, attitude toward use, and behavioral intention to use. Each question was measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ""strongly disagree"" (1 point) to ""strongly agree"" (5 points).

RESULTS: A total of 350 valid questionnaire responses were collected (female: 219/350, 62.6%; age: 21-30 years: 238/350, 68.0%; university-level education: 228/350, 65.1%; occupation as student: 195/350, 56.6%; average monthly income <NT $30,000 [<US $1054.89]: 230/350, 65.7%; residence in northern Taiwan: 236/350, 67.4%; and health status perceived as ""good"": 171/350, 48.9%). Five indicators, including chi-square test (X2310=2.63), goodness-of-fit index (0.85), adjusted goodness-of-fit index (0.81), comparative fit index (0.91), and root mean square error of approximation (0.07), were calculated. The results indicated a good fit. Further analysis indicated that the most important factor affecting respondents' behavioral intention to use MHB was their attitude toward use (0.78), followed by perceived ease of use (0.65), perceived usefulness (0.41), health literacy (0.10), and privacy and security (0.07). CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the populace, this study explored the factors affecting the use of MHB and constructed an interpretation model with a strong goodness of fit. The results of our analysis are consistent with the technology acceptance model. Through the diverse value-added services of MHB, Taiwan's experience in pandemic prevention with smart technology can facilitate future responses to unknown, emerging infectious diseases.","Tsai, Wen-Hsun; Wu, Yi-Syuan; Cheng, Chia-Shiang; Kuo, Ming-Hao; Chang, Yu-Tien; Hu, Fu-Kang; Sun, Chien-An; Chang, Chi-Wen; Chan, Ta-Chien; Chen, Chao-Wen; Lee, Chia-Cheng; Chu, Chi-Ming",J Med Internet Res,,251

In this paper, we propose mask usage detection approach based on deep learning: a Mask Regional-Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) that provides segmentation of faces and masks, and another CNN using a novel Soft Attention unit to detect the correctness of the mask usage. We also provide a small instance segmented subset of the Masked Faces (MAFA) dataset for instance segmentation problems. We use the Mask R-CNN to provide instance segmentations of faces and face masks to the visual relationship detection CNN and predict improperly and properly worn face masks. Various CNN architectures such as ResNet50 were tested and compared to determine its effectiveness for the above task. We evaluate the CNN architectures on accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity of detecting properly worn masks. The best performing network was determined to be the ResNet50V2 architecture with 76.27% accuracy, 84.76% precision, 74.38% recall, and 79.20% specificity.","Truong, T.; Lalseta, D.; Ittyipe, R.; Yanushkevich, S.; Ieee,",IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI),,251

483710,Charities issue coronavirus advice for people with cancer,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Besides the common symptoms of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) including fever, shortness of breath, and cough, a ""sudden loss of smell"" has recently been added as a diagnostic symptom. The relationship between paranasal sinus computed tomography (PNS CT) and sudden loss of smell in COVID-19 was examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups were selected for the study, the COVID-19 and the control groups. The control group consisted of 40 patients who applied to our clinic with headache and therefore underwent PNS CT. The other group consisted of 40 patients with COVID-19 who were diagnosed with sudden loss of smell with the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) olfactory test. Clinical and demographic characteristics, tomography results, and olfactory test scores of patients with COVID-19 loss of smell and control group patients were recorded. The relationship between CT changes in the olfactory cleft and the degree of loss of smell was evaluated. The ""Opacification in the olfactory cleft"" was accepted as a positive CT finding. RESULTS: Comparison of patients with COVID-19 who had a loss of smell and the control group indicated that a significant difference was observed in terms of CT findings (P = .022). When we evaluated the paranasal CTs obtained from our patients with loss of smell, the CT of 13 patients showed pathological findings (P < .05). As the COVID-19 progressed (pneumonia and respiratory failure), the degree of loss of smell increased (P < .05). A statistically significant relationship was found between the CCCRC score and the presence of PNS CT findings (P = .0012). CONCLUSION: The PNS CT findings are significant in patients with COVID-19 with a loss of smell and were significantly associated with the degree of loss of smell. In patients with olfactory loss due to COVID-19, PNS CT can help in diagnosis. However, for this imaging to be diagnostic, a larger patient series is needed.","Yildiz, Erkan; Balci, Aydin; Selendili, Okan; Kuzu, Selçuk",Ear Nose Throat J,,251

This study investigated the potential of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) to improve the intestinal permeation and absorption of low-permeable low-molecular-weight (low-MW) drugs. METHODS: The in vitro epithelial permeation of six different drugs (metformin, risedronate, zanamivir, methotrexate [MTX], tacrolimus, and vincristine [VCR]) across Caco-2 cell monolayers was examined in the presence and absence of L- or D-penetratin, and the correlation between permeation enhancement efficiency and the properties of tested drugs was analyzed. In addition, a rat closed ileal loop absorption study was conducted to determine the in vivo effects of penetratin. RESULTS: MTX and VCR efficiently permeated Caco-2 monolayers in the presence of L- and D-penetratin, suggesting that CPPs enhanced the epithelial permeation of drugs with relatively high molecular weight and resultant limited intrinsic permeability. The in vivo rat closed ileal loop absorption study revealed the stimulatory effect of L- and D-penetratin on the intestinal absorption of MTX and VCR. CONCLUSIONS: CPPs are useful as oral absorption enhancers for low-permeable drugs.","Kamei, Noriyasu; Yamanaka, Jumpei; Oda, Yutaro; Kaneoka, Shohei; Koide, Yumeko; Haruna, Yuta; Takahashi, Yuta; Tamiwa, Hideyuki; Takeda-Morishita, Mariko",Pharm Res,,251

485820,Leveraging systems biology for predicting modulators of inflammation in patients with COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: There are no publicly available national data on healthcare worker infections in Australia. It has been documented in many countries that healthcare workers (HCW) are at increased occupational risk of COVID-19. We aimed to estimate the burden of COVID-19 on Australia HCW and the health system by obtaining and organizing data on HCW infections, analyzing national HCW cases in regards to occupational risk and analyzing healthcare outbreak. METHODS: We searched government reports and websites and media reports to create a comprehensive line listing of Australian HCW infections and nosocomial outbreaks between January 25th and July 8th, 2020. A line list of HCW related COVID-19 reported cases was created and enhanced by matching data extracted from media reports of healthcare related COVID-19 relevant outbreaks and reports, using matching criteria. Rates of infections and odds ratios (ORs) for HCW were calculated per state, by comparing overall cases to HCW cases. To investigate the sources of infection amongst HCW, transmission data were collated and graphed to show distribution of sources. RESULTS: We identified 36 hospital outbreaks or HCW infection reports between January 25th and July 8th, 2020. According to our estimates, at least 536 HCW in Australia had been infected with COVID-19, comprising 6.03% of all reported infections. The rate of HCW infection was 90/100000 and of community infection 34/100,000. HCW were 2.69 times more likely to contract COVID-19 (95% CI 2.48 to 2.93; Pâ¯<â¯0.001). The timing of hospital outbreaks did not always correspond to community peaks. Where data were available, a total of 131 HCW across 21 outbreaks led to 1656 HCW being furloughed for quarantine. In one outbreak, one hospital was closed and 1200 HCW quarantined. CONCLUSION: The study shows that HCW were at nearly 3 times the risk of infection. Of concern, this nearly tripling of risk occurred during a period of low community prevalence suggesting failures at multiple hazard levels including PPE policies within the work environment. Even in a country with relatively good control of COVID-19, HCW are at greater risk of infection than the general community and nosocomial outbreaks can have substantial effects on workforce capacity by the quarantine of numerous HCW during an outbreak. The occurrence of hospital outbreaks even when community incidence was low highlights the high risk setting that hospitals present. Australia faced a resurgence of COVID-19 after the study period, with multiple hospital outbreaks. We recommend formal reporting of HCW infections, testing protocols for nosocomial outbreaks, cohorting of workforce to minimize the impact, and improved PPE guidelines to provide precautionary and optimal protection for HCW.","Quigley, Ashley L; Stone, Haley; Nguyen, Phi Yen; Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; MacIntyre, C Raina",Int J Nurs Stud,,251

The intervention has been evaluated in a single-arm feasibility study with embedded process evaluation. The feasibility study was due to open to recruitment during the COVID-19 2020-2021 pandemic, 1 month into the first UK-wide lockdown. We worked rapidly to implement adaptions to the trial procedures and intervention delivery that we believe are applicable to randomised controlled trials. Recruitment became predominantly via self-referral. Electronic consent was employed, with consent discussions occurring over the telephone. Registration, consent, eligibility assessment and data collection as well as the intervention (online physical activity tool) were via a secure, encrypted multi-user web-based platform for participants, physiotherapists and researchers accessible via various hardware. Physiotherapy consultations, as well as the process evaluation, were conducted remotely using video conferencing software or the telephone. A remote training package for physiotherapists and site initiations was also developed and electronic site files employed. Our adaptions are extremely topical given the COVID-19 situation, and whilst not what we had originally planned, have enabled successful delivery of the feasibility study and are relevant to conducting randomised controlled trials and meeting the needs of people with MS who are far more isolated than ever before.

Tempol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) reduces tissue injury associated with inflammation in vivo by mechanisms that are not completely understood. Here we evaluated the effect of tempol on inflammation and oxidative damage induced by acute exposure to cigarette smoke in vivo. Male C57BL/6 mice (nâ¯=â¯32) were divided into 4 groups (nâ¯=â¯8 each): 1) control group exposed to ambient air (GC), 2) animals exposed to cigarette smoke for 5 days (CSG), mice treated 3) prior or 4) concomitantly with tempol (50â¯mg/kg/day) and exposed to cigarette smoke for 5 days. The results showed that the total number of leukocytes and neutrophils increased in the respiratory tract and lung parenchyma of mice exposed to cigarette smoke. Likewise, MPO levels and activity as well as lipid peroxidation and lung protein nitration and carbonylation also increased. Administration of tempol before or during exposure to cigarette smoke inhibited all the above parameters. Tempol also reduced the pulmonary expression of the inflammatory cytokines Il-6, Il-1ß and Il-17 to basal levels and of Tnf-&#945; by approximately 50%. In contrast, tempol restored Il-10 and Tgf-ß levels and enhanced the expression of Nrf2-associated genes, such as Ho-1 and Gpx2. In agreement, total GPx activity increased in lung homogenates of tempol treated animals. Taken together, the results show that tempol protects mouse lungs from inflammation and oxidative damage resulting from exposure to cigarette smoke, probably through reduction of leukocyte infiltration and increased transcription of some of the Nrf2-controlled genes.","Almeida da Silva, Danielba; Lopes Correia, Thiago Macêdo; Pereira, Rafael; Augusto da Silva, Robson Amaro; Augusto, Ohara; Queiroz, Raphael Ferreira",Chem Biol Interact,,251

I show how he develops a political theology of the spirit through a discussion of social distancing In this argument Žižek connects the idea of physical distance to the biblical story of the resurrection, in which Jesus says to Mary Magdalene “noli me tangere” (“touch me not”), in order to imagine the emergence of a community of spirit from the social, political, and economic ruin caused by the COVID-19 pandemic Contrasting this community of spirit to the Chinese Communist Party's Foucauldian response to the outbreak of the virus, Žižek suggests a turn away from Prometheanism and the logic of domination toward a new posthuman humanitarianism based on a recognition of human weakness, vulnerability, and fragility In Žižek's view, this turn toward a new form of humility would emerge from the final disenchantment of the spirit of capitalism and a recognition of the difference between human work, which contributes to a meaningful world, and bestial labor that dehumanizes and means nothing Thus, the article shows how Žižek thinks about the pandemic in terms of a crisis of late capitalism and the possibility of a new spirit of communism While the presexual nonlife of the virus is comparable to the drive of capitalism in respect of its unthinking will to replication and reproduction, Žižek founds the basis of humanity in our (human) mortality and being toward death that open out onto a new horizon of releasement (Gelassenheit) beyond biotechnoeconomic nihilism The conclusion of the article, therefore, shows how Žižek imagines that the pandemic presents humanity with an existential choice about the way we organize social life This choice is between the biopolitical domination of Chinese authoritarianism that seeks to control every aspect of life, American disaster capitalism that accepts the brutality of the state of nature, and finally Žižek's utopian spirit of communism based on a recognition of human and planetary finitude","Featherstone, Mark",Cultural Politics: an International Journal,,251
495369,Coronavirus Farewell,2020,"(1) Introduction. A recent viral outbreak of novel coronavirus (CoVID-19) was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to its global public health concern. There has been an aggressive growth in the number of emerging cases suggesting rapid spread of the virus. Since the first reported case of CoVID-19, there has been vast progress in understanding the dynamics of CoVID-19. However, there is an increasing evidence of epidemiological disparity in disease burden between urban and rural areas, with rural areas having minimal pandemic preparedness and their own healthcare challenges. Therefore, this review aims to provide insight on the pathogenesis and the transmission dynamics of CoVID-19 along with pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention strategies to mitigate the clinical manifestation of this virus. This review also aims to assess existing challenges of the CoVID-19 pandemic in rural areas based on past pandemic experiences and the effect on rural population. (2) Methods. A literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Academic Search Premier, ProQuest, and Google Scholar, along with information from governmental organizations such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO). (3) Results. The causative virus, with its likely zoonotic origin, has demonstrated high pathogenicity in humans through increasing human-to-human transmission leading to extensive mitigation strategies, including patient quarantine and mass ""social distancing"" measures. Although the clinical manifestation of symptoms is mild in majority of the virus-inflicted population, critical patients may present with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, exacerbated by pre-existing comorbidities, eventually leading to death. While effective coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-specific vaccines and drugs are under clinical trials, several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been adapted to manage symptoms and curtail the effect of the virus to prevent increasing morbidity and mortality. Several persisting challenges have been noted for mitigating CoVID-19 in rural areas, including the poor healthcare infrastructure, health literacy, pandemic preparedness along with the fact that majority of rural population are frail subjects with pre-existing comorbidities. (4) Discussion. The increasing rate of incidence of CoVID-19 presents its own challenges, burdening healthcare institutions and the global economy, and impacting the physical and mental health of people worldwide. Given the clinical insights into CoVID-19 and the challenges presented in this review for the U.S. rural population, mitigation strategies should be designed accordingly to minimize the morbidity and mortality of this contagion.","Lakhani, Hari Vishal; Pillai, Sneha S; Zehra, Mishghan; Sharma, Ishita; Sodhi, Komal",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,251
495492,"COVID-19 and telehealth, education, and research adaptations",2020,"Alzheimer's disease and small vessel ischemic disease frequently co-exist in the aging brain. However, pathogenic links between these 2 disorders are yet to be identified. Therefore we used Taqman genotyping, exome and RNA sequencing to investigate Alzheimer's disease known pathogenic variants and pathways: APOE Îµ4 allele, APP-Aß metabolism and late-onset Alzheimer's disease main genome-wide association loci (APOE, BIN1, CD33, MS4A6A, CD2AP, PICALM, CLU, CR1, EPHA1, ABCA7) in 96 early-onset small vessel ischemic disease Caucasian patients and 368 elderly neuropathologically proven controls (HEX database) and in a mouse model of cerebral hypoperfusion. Only a minority of patients (29%) carried APOE Îµ4 allele. We did not detect any pathogenic mutation in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 and report a burden of truncating mutations in APP-Aß degradation genes. The single-variant association test identified 3 common variants with a likely protective effect on small vessel ischemic disease (0.54>OR > 0.32, adj. p-value <0.05) (EPHA1 p.M900V and p.V160A and CD33 p.A14V). Moreover, 5/17 APP-Aß catabolism genes were significantly upregulated (LogFC > 1, adj. p-val<0.05) together with Apoe, Ms4a cluster and Cd33 during brain hypoperfusion and their overexpression correlated with the ischemic lesion size. Finally, the detection of Aß oligomers in the hypoperfused hippocampus supported the link between brain ischemia and Alzheimer's disease pathology.","Blumenau, Sonja; Foddis, Marco; Müller, Susanne; Holtgrewe, Manuel; Bentele, Kajetan; Berchtold, Daniel; Beule, Dieter; Dirnagl, Ulrich; Sassi, Celeste",Sci Rep,,251

The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of an intervention aimed at reducing anxiety and distress in DCGs of patients with cancer. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial enrolled DCGs of patients with all cancer types who were being seen monthly by oncologists in outpatient clinics. There were three arms of the intervention delivered over a 4-month period: arm 1 (a) received 4 monthly videoconference-tailored coaching sessions with an advanced practice nurse or social worker focused on information and support, (b) participated in patient's appointments with the oncologist via videoconference over the 4-month study period, and (c) had access to a website designed for DCGs. Arm 2 did not receive the coaching sessions but received the other two components, and arm 3 received access to the DCG website only. RESULTS: There were 302 DCGs who provided pre- and postintervention data. There were significant anxiety by group (P = .028 and r = 0.16) and distress by group interactions (P = .014 and r = 0.17). Arm 1 had the greatest percentage of DCGs who demonstrated improvement in anxiety (18.6%) and distress (25.2%). CONCLUSION: Coaching and use of videoconference technology (to join the DCG into the patient-oncologist office visit) were effective in reducing both anxiety and distress for DCGs. These components could be considered for local CGs who-with COVID-19-are unable to accompany the patient to oncologist visits.","Douglas, Sara L; Mazanec, Polly; Lipson, Amy R; Day, Kim; Blackstone, Eric; Bajor, David L; Saltzman, Joel; Krishnamurthi, Smitha",JCO Oncol Pract,,251

A range of different measures have been implemented worldwide to reduce the rate of new infections and to manage the pressure on national health services. A primary strategy has been to reduce gatherings and the potential for transmission through the prioritisation of remote working and education. Enhanced hand hygiene and the use of facial masks have decreased the spread of pathogens when gatherings are unavoidable. These particular measures present challenges for reliable biometric recognition, e.g. for facial-, voice- and hand-based biometrics. At the same time, new challenges create new opportunities and research directions, e.g. renewed interest in non-constrained iris or periocular recognition, touch-less fingerprint- and vein-based authentication and the use of biometric characteristics for disease detection. This article presents an overview of the research carried out to address those challenges and emerging opportunities.","Gomez-Barrero, Marta; Drozdowski, Pawel; Rathgeb, Christian; Patino, Jose; Todisco, Massimmiliano; Nautsch, Andras; Damer, Naser; Priesnitz, Jannis; Evans, Nicholas; Busch, Christoph",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09258v1.pdf,251

One option for mitigating an FFR shortage is to decontaminate and reuse the devices. The focus of this study was to develop a new evaluation technique based on 3 major decontamination requirements: (1) inactivating viruses, (2) not altering the respirator properties, and (3) not leaving any toxic byproduct on the FFR. METHODS: Hydrophilic and hydrophobic FFRs were contaminated with MS2 virus. In the solution-based deposition, the virus-containing liquid droplets were spiked directly onto FFRs, while in the vapor-based and aerosol-based depositions, the viral particles were loaded onto FFRs using a bio-aerosol testing system. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) and moist heat (MH) decontamination methods were used for inactivation of viruses applied to FFRs. RESULTS: Both UVGI and MH methods inactivated viruses (>5-log reduction of MS2 virus; in 92% of both method experiments, the virus was reduced to levels below the detection limit), did not alter the respirator properties, and did not leave any toxic byproduct on the FFRs. CONCLUSIONS: Both UVGI and MH methods could be considered as promising decontamination candidates for inactivation of viruses for respirator reuse during shortages.","Vo, Evanly; Rengasamy, Samy; Xu, Susan; Horvatin, Matthew; Zhuang, Ziqing",Am. j. infect. control,,251

Surfactant, assembled as a complex network of membranous structures, integrates elements in charge of reducing surface tension to a minimum along the breathing cycle, thus maintaining a large surface open to gas exchange and also protecting the lung and the body from the entrance of a myriad of potentially pathogenic entities. Different molecules in the surfactant establish a multivalent crosstalk with the epithelium, the immune system and the lung microbiota, constituting a crucial platform to sustain homeostasis, under health and disease. This review summarizes some of the most important molecules and interactions within lung surfactant and how multiple lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions contribute to the proper maintenance of an operative respiratory surface.","Cañadas, Olga; Olmeda, Bárbara; Alonso, Alejandro; Pérez-Gil, Jesús",,,251
506377,Complement cascade in severe forms of COVID-19: Recent advances in therapy,2021,"Moral distress is defined as the inability to act according to one's own core values. During the COVID-19 pandemic, moral distress in medical personnel has gained attention, related to the impact of pandemic-associated factors, such as the uncertainty of treatment options for the virus and the accelerated pace of deaths. Measures to provide aid and mitigate the long-term pandemic effect on providers are starting to be designed. Yet, little has been said about the moral distress experienced by patients and the relational and additive effect on provider moral distress. Pandemic-associated factors affecting moral distress in patients include the constraining effects of isolation on spiritual and religious traditions as well as the intentional separation of patients from their families. This paper will explore the idea that patients are suffering their own moral distress and further how this impacts the intensity of moral distress experienced by the providers-nurses and physicians. The paucity of research in this area with the implications on patient's distress, decision making, and distress experienced by providers compels further investigation and analysis.","Vittone, Sarah; Sotomayor, Claudia R",HEC forum,,251

First, the international course’s research topics and trends were analyzed. Second, other Chinese universities with international courses in safety engineering were counted. Finally, the international courses in safety engineering at CUMTB were analyzed from three aspects: teachers, teaching content, and course effect. The results show that there is a developing trend in international course research focusing on specific disciplines. For the safety engineering international course at CUMTB, foreign university teachers are the first choice for course instruction;however, the language barrier is a primary problem. In terms of teaching content, students are more interested in their intended employment fields and lack an understanding of various research fields. The course meets the students’ expectations but can still be improved. According to the results, we conclude that bilingual teaching by ethnic Chinese university teachers leads to more efficient knowledge acquisition. A guidance course and a survey of students’ employment intentions should be added before the course. Through these measures, the international course’s effectiveness and quality can be improved to better realize sustainable development.","Zhou, Jiankai Gao Yangping Wang Yintong",Sustainability,,251

In built environments, exposure to infectious microorganisms and their byproducts is clearly linked to human health. In the last year, public health emergency surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic stressed the importance of having good biosafety measures and practices. To prevent infection from spreading and to maintain the barrier, disinfection and hygiene habits are crucial, especially when the microorganism can persist and survive on surfaces. Contaminated surfaces are called fomites and on them, microorganisms can survive even for months. As a consequence, fomites serve as a second reservoir and transfer pathogens between hosts. The knowledge of microorganisms, type of surface, and antimicrobial agent is fundamental to develop the best approach to sanitize fomites and to obtain good disinfection levels. Hence, this review has the purpose to briefly describe the organisms, the kind of risk associated with them, and the main classes of antimicrobials for surfaces, to help choose the right approach to prevent exposure to pathogens.","Artasensi, A.; Mazzotta, S.; Fumagalli, L.",Antibiotics,,251

508331,Digestive symptoms of COVID-19 and expression of ACE2 in digestive tract organs,2020,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 18,000 Syrian refugees have resettled to the United States. Half of these refugees are children, whose age and refugee status jeopardize their abilities to attain quality healthcare. Information on Syrian refugees' health in the U.S. is limited. This qualitative study sought to explore Syrian refugee parents' beliefs, perspectives, and practices regarding their children's health through in-depth interviews. METHODS: Eighteen Syrian refugee parents residing in Cincinnati, Ohio were interviewed in Arabic by bilingual researchers using semi-structured in-depth interviews. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated. Three members of the research team independently coded each interview using an inductive thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Analysis identified four salient themes: stressors preclude health seeking behaviors, parents perceive health barriers, parents are dissatisfied with the healthcare system, and parents use resilience behaviors to overcome barriers. Stressors included poor housing and neighborhoods, reliving traumatic experiences, depression and anxiety, and social isolation. Dissatisfaction included emergency room wait times, lack of testing and prescriptions. Health barriers included missed appointments and inadequate transportation, translation services, health literacy and care coordination. Parents reported resilience through faith, by seeking knowledge, use of natural remedies, and utilizing community resources. CONCLUSION: This qualitative study provides information on the beliefs, practices, and behaviors of Syrian refugee parents related to health care utilization of pediatric refugees in the United States. Psychosocial and environmental stressors as well as perceived systemic health barriers, hinder health seeking behaviors in Syrian refugee parents. Culturally relevant care targeting perceived barriers and incorporating resilience behaviors may improve parental satisfaction and parental health seeking behaviors. Further study is needed to implement and evaluate interventions that target identified barriers.","Alwan, Riham M; Schumacher, Daniel J; Cicek-Okay, Sevsem; Jernigan, Sarah; Beydoun, Ahmed; Salem, Tasnim; Vaughn, Lisa M",PLoS One,,251
508367,Id: 3527100 Pre-procedural Covid-19 Screening for Outpatient Gastrointestinal Endoscopy,2021,"INTRODUCTION: While much of the literature on homelessness is centred on the experience of men, women make up over one-quarter of Canada's homeless population. Research has shown that women experiencing homelessness are often hidden (i.e. provisionally housed) and have different pathways into homelessness and different needs as compared to men. The objective of this research is to identify evidence-based interventions and best practices to better support women experiencing or at risk of homelessness. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review with a gender and equity analysis. This involved searching MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and other databases for systematic reviews and randomized trials, supplementing our search through reference scanning and grey literature, followed by a qualitative synthesis of the evidence that examined gender and equity considerations. RESULTS: Of the 4102 articles identified on homelessness interventions, only 4 systematic reviews and 9 randomized trials were exclusively conducted on women or published disaggregated data enabling a gender analysis. Interventions with the strongest evidence included post-shelter advocacy counselling for women experiencing homelessness due to intimate partner violence, as well as case management and permanent housing subsidies (e.g. tenant-based rental assistance vouchers), which were shown to reduce homelessness, food insecurity, exposure to violence and psychosocial distress, as well as promote school stability and child well-being. CONCLUSION: Much of the evidence on interventions to better support women experiencing homelessness focusses on those accessing domestic violence or family shelters.

510333,Multi-omic profiling reveals widespread dysregulation of innate immunity and hematopoiesis in COVID-19,2021,"The intricacy of the maternal immune system arises from its ability to prevent a maternal immune response against a semi-allogenic fetus, while protecting the mother against harmful pathogens. However, these immunological adaptations may also make pregnant women vulnerable to developing adverse complications from respiratory viral infections. While the influenza and SARS pandemics support this theory, there is less certainty regarding the clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine development is key to public preventative strategies. Whilst most viral vaccines are able to induce a seroprotective antibody response, in some high-risk individuals this may not correlate with clinical protection. Some studies have shown that factors such as age, gender, and chronic illnesses can reduce their effectiveness and in this review, we discuss how pregnancy may affect the efficacy and immunogenicity of vaccines. We present literature to support the hypothesis that pregnant women are more susceptible to respiratory viral infections and may not respond to vaccines as effectively. In particular, we focus on the clinical implications of important respiratory viral infections such as influenza during pregnancy, and the pregnancy induced alterations in important leukocytes such as TFH, cTFH and B cells, which play an important role in generating long-lasting and high-affinity antibodies. Finally, we review how this may affect the efficacy of vaccines against influenza in pregnancy and highlight areas that require further research.","Saeed, Zainab; Greer, Orene; Shah, Nishel Mohan",Antibodies,,251

This study aims to explore the association between risk perception (perceived severity and perceived probability), perceived efficacy (individual's efficacy and government's efficacy), trust in authorities, and intention to implement influenza protective behaviors. METHODS: The data (Nâ¯=â¯1,372) used in this paper comes from the 2013 Taiwan Social Change Survey dataset. Six intentions of protective behaviors (getting vaccinated, wearing a mask, washing hands, avoiding going to public settings, sanitizing home, and eating nutritional supplements) were investigated. Tobit and ordered logistic regressions were used to conduct data analysis. RESULTS: Respondents were most inclined to washing hands, followed by wearing a mask, avoiding going to public settings, getting vaccine, sanitizing their homes, and eating nutritional supplements. Perceived severity and individual's efficacy were positively correlated with all 6 behavioral intentions. Trust in authorities has positive effect on all the protective behaviors except sanitizing home. Moreover, perceived probability has positive relationships with overall intention, intention to wear mask, and intention to wash hands. Government's efficacy was only positively correlated with eating nutritional supplements. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived severity and perceived response efficacy towards flu, as well as trust in authorities were relatively important factors in motivating people's intention to adopt influenza protective behaviors.","Gong, Zepeng; Veuthey, Justin; Han, Ziqiang",Am J Infect Control,,251
510615,COVID-19 and the Gut Microbiome: More than a Gut Feeling,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could disproportionately affect the health of vulnerable populations, including patients experiencing persistent health conditions (i.e., chronic pain), along with populations living within deprived, lower socioeconomic areas. The current cross-sectional study characterized relationships between neighborhood deprivation and perceived changes in pain-related experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic (early-September to mid-October 2020) for adult patients (N = 97) with nonspecific chronic low back pain. METHODS: We collected self-report perceived experiences from participants enrolled in an ongoing pragmatic randomized trial across medical centers within the Salt Lake City, Utah and Baltimore, Maryland metropolitans. The Area Deprivation Index (composite of 17 U.S. Census deprivation metrics) reflected neighborhood deprivation based on participants' zip codes. RESULTS: Although those living in the neighborhoods with greater deprivation endorsed significantly poorer physical (pain severity, pain interference, physical functioning), mental (depression, anxiety), and social health during the pandemic, there were no significant differences for perceived changes in pain-related experiences (pain severity, pain interference, sleep quality) between levels of neighborhood deprivation since the onset of the pandemic. However, those in neighborhoods with greater deprivation endorsed disproportionately worse perceived changes in pain coping, social support, and mood since the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings offer evidence that changes in pain coping during the pandemic may be disproportionately worse for those living in deprived areas. Considering poorer pain coping may contribute to long-term consequences, the current findings suggest the need for further attention and intervention to reduce the negative affect of the pandemic for such vulnerable populations.","Rassu, Fenan S; McFadden, Molly; Aaron, Rachel V; Wegener, Stephen T; Ephraim, Patti L; Lane, Elizabeth; Brennan, Gerard; Minick, Kate I; Fritz, Julie M; Skolasky, Richard L",Pain med,,251

513882,Lockdown fears for key populations,2020,"BACKGROUND: A sense of urgency exists to develop vaccines against SARS CoV-2, responsible for numerous global cases and deaths, as well as widespread social and economic disruption. Multiple approaches have been proposed to speed up vaccine development, including accelerated randomized controlled trials (RCT), controlled human challenge trials (CHI), and wide distribution through an emergency use authorization after collecting initial data. There is a need to examine how best to accelerate vaccine development in the setting of a pandemic, without compromising ethical and scientific norms. METHODS: Trade-offs in scientific and social value between generating reliable evidence about safety and efficacy while promoting rapid vaccine availability are examined along five ethically relevant dimensions: (1) confidence in and generalizability of data, (2) feasibility, (3) speed and cost, (4) participant risks, and (5) social risks. RESULTS: Accelerated individually randomized RCTs permit expeditious evaluation of vaccine candidates using established methods, expertise, and infrastructure. RCTs are more likely than other approaches to be feasible, increase speed and reduce cost, and generate reliable data about safety and efficacy without significantly increasing risks to participants or undermining societal trust. CONCLUSION: Ethical analysis suggests that accelerated RCTs are the best approach to accelerating vaccine development in a pandemic, and more likely than other approaches to enhance social value without compromising ethics or science. RCTs can expeditiously collect rigorous data about vaccine safety and efficacy. Innovative and flexible designs and implementation strategies to respond to shifting incidence and test vaccine candidates in parallel or sequentially would add value, as will coordinated data sharing across vaccine trials. CHI studies may be an important complementary strategy when more is known. Widely disseminating a vaccine candidate without efficacy data will not serve the public health nor achieve the goal of identifying safe and effective SARS Co-V-2 vaccines.","Grady, Christine; Shah, Seema; Miller, Franklin; Danis, Marion; Nicolini, Marie; Ochoa, Jorge; Taylor, Holly; Wendler, Dave; Rid, Annette",Vaccine,,251

Although we live in an information era, we do not have accurate information about this disease. Online social networks (OSNs) play a vital role in society, especially people who do not have trust in the government would tend to have more confidence in the evidence that is formed by social networks. The advantages of OSNs in the COVID-19 era are clear. For instance, social media enables people to connect with each other without the need for real-world face-to-face social interaction. Social media networks also act as a collective intelligence in the absence of world leadership. Therefore, in this study, considering the phenomenon of information diffusion in OSNs, we focus on the effects of COVID-19 on user sentiment and show the user behavior trend during the early months of the pandemic through mining and analyzing OSN data. Moreover, we propose a data-driven model to demonstrate how user sentiment changes over a period of time and how OSNs help us to obtain information on user behavior that is very important for the accurate prediction of future behavior. For this purpose, this study uses tweet texts about COVID-19 and the related network structure to extract significant features, and then presents a model attempting to provide a more comprehensive real picture of current and future conditions.","Mahmoudi, Amin; Yeung, Victoria Wai-lan; See-To, Eric W.

Based on the publicly available contact-tracing data, we identified 509 transmission chains from 20 provinces in China and estimated the serial interval (SI) and generation interval (GI) of COVID-19 in China. Inspired by different possible values of the time-varying reproduction number for the imported cases and the local cases in China, we divided all transmission events into three subsets: imported (the zeroth generation) infecting 1st-generation locals, 1st-generation locals infecting 2nd-generation locals, and other transmissions among 2+. The corresponding SI (GI) is respectively denoted as SI 1 0 ( GI 1 0 ), SI 2 1 ( GI 2 1 ), and SI 3 + 2 + ( GI 3 + 2 + ). A Bayesian approach with doubly interval-censored likelihood is employed to fit the distribution function of the SI and GI. It was found that the estimated SI 1 0 = 6 . 52 ( 95 % CI : 5 . 96 - 7 . 13 ) , SI 2 1 = 6 . 01 ( 95 % CI : 5 . 44 - 6 . 64 ) , SI 3 + 2 + = 4 . 39 ( 95 % CI : 3 . 74 - 5 . 15 ) , and GI 1 0 = 5 . 47 ( 95 % CI : 4 . 57 - 6 . 45 ) , GI 2 1 = 5 . 01 ( 95 % CI : 3 . 58 - 7 . 06 ) , GI 3 + 2 + = 4 . 25 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 82 - 6 . 23 ) .

519297,Fooling thermal infrared pedestrian detectors in real world using small bulbs,2021-01-20,"Federated learning (FL) learns a model jointly from a set of participating devices without sharing each other's privately held data. The characteristics of non-iid data across the network, low device participation, and the mandate that data remain private bring challenges in understanding the convergence of FL algorithms, particularly in regards to how convergence scales with the number of participating devices. In this paper, we focus on Federated Averaging (FedAvg)--the most widely used and effective FL algorithm in use today--and provide a comprehensive study of its convergence rate. Although FedAvg has recently been studied by an emerging line of literature, it remains open as to how FedAvg's convergence scales with the number of participating devices in the FL setting--a crucial question whose answer would shed light on the performance of FedAvg in large FL systems. We fill this gap by establishing convergence guarantees for FedAvg under three classes of problems: strongly convex smooth, convex smooth, and overparameterized strongly convex smooth problems. We show that FedAvg enjoys linear speedup in each case, although with different convergence rates. For each class, we also characterize the corresponding convergence rates for the Nesterov accelerated FedAvg algorithm in the FL setting: to the best of our knowledge, these are the first linear speedup guarantees for FedAvg when Nesterov acceleration is used. To accelerate FedAvg, we also design a new momentum-based FL algorithm that further improves the convergence rate in overparameterized linear regression problems. Empirical studies of the algorithms in various settings have supported our theoretical results.","Qu, Zhaonan; Lin, Kaixiang; Kalagnanam, Jayant; Li, Zhaojian; Zhou, Jiayu; Zhou, Zhengyuan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05690v1.pdf,251

520779,Self-perceived disease control in childhood eczema,2020,"The legal and illegal trade in wildlife for food, medicine and other products is a globally significant threat to biodiversity that is also responsible for the emergence of pathogens that threaten human and livestock health and our global economy. Trade in wildlife likely played a role in the origin of COVID-19, and viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in bats and pangolins, both traded widely. To investigate the possible role of pangolins as a source of potential zoonoses, we collected throat and rectal swabs from 334 Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) confiscated in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah between August 2009 and March 2019. Total nucleic acid was extracted for viral molecular screening using conventional PCR protocols used to routinely identify known and novel viruses in extensive prior sampling (> 50,000 mammals). No sample yielded a positive PCR result for any of the targeted viral families-Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae. In the light of recent reports of coronaviruses including a SARS-CoV-2-related virus in Sunda pangolins in China, the lack of any coronavirus detection in our 'upstream' market chain samples suggests that these detections in 'downstream' animals more plausibly reflect exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network. While confirmatory serologic studies are needed, it is likely that Sunda pangolins are incidental hosts of coronaviruses. Our findings further support the importance of ending the trade in wildlife globally.","Lee, Jimmy; Hughes, Tom; Lee, Mei-Ho; Field, Hume; Rovie-Ryan, Jeffrine Japning; Sitam, Frankie Thomas; Sipangkui, Symphorosa; Nathan, Senthilvel K S S; Ramirez, Diana; Kumar, Subbiah Vijay; Lasimbang, Helen; Epstein, Jonathan H; Daszak, Peter",Ecohealth,,251
521397,COVID-19: more evidence emerges,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 crisis is a significant stressor worldwide. The physical and emotional condition of individuals with pain sensitization syndromes who are experiencing the pandemic may worsen. This study investigated the contribution of life changes due to the coronavirus to emotional distress in individuals with a diagnosis of chronic central sensitization pain and tested whether the associations between level of pain and sensitization were independent of or mediated by emotional distress. METHODS: Spanish individuals with chronic pain (N = 362) completed an online survey on direct or indirect exposure to the consequences of COVID-19, pain intensity, and emotional distress. They also completed central sensitization questionnaires. RESULTS: An association was found between changes in daily routines and pain intensity, emotional distress, and sensitization scores. Correlations were found between emotional distress, sensitization, and pain intensity. Significant predictors of emotional distress were age, difficulty in receiving medical care, changes in daily routines, and diminished social support. Emotional distress did not mediate the association between sensitization and pain intensity. CONCLUSION: Due to the COVID-19 situation, individuals with central sensitization pain syndromes may be at higher risk of developing psychological distress. Interdisciplinary interventions involving psychologists are urgently needed to provide this population with appropriate health care.","Serrano-Ibáñez, Elena R; Esteve, Rosa; Ramírez-Maestre, Carmen; Ruiz-Párraga, Gema T; López-Martínez, Alicia E",Br. j. health psychol,,251

We conducted a serologic survey in 15 hospitals and 56 nursing homes across Rhode Island, USA, during July 17-August 28, 2020. Overall seropositivity among 9,863 healthcare personnel was 4.6% (95% CI 4.2%-5.0%) but varied 4-fold between hospital personnel (3.1%, 95% CI 2.7%-3.5%) and nursing home personnel (13.1%, 95% CI 11.5%-14.9%). Within nursing homes, prevalence was highest among personnel working in coronavirus disease units (24.1%; 95% CI 20.6%-27.8%). Adjusted analysis showed that in hospitals, nurses and receptionists/medical assistants had a higher likelihood of seropositivity than physicians. In nursing homes, nursing assistants and social workers/case managers had higher likelihoods of seropositivity than occupational/physical/speech therapists. Nursing home personnel in all occupations had elevated seropositivity compared with hospital counterparts. Additional mitigation strategies are needed to protect nursing home personnel from infection, regardless of occupation.","Akinbami, Lara J; Chan, Philip A; Vuong, Nga; Sami, Samira; Lewis, Dawn; Sheridan, Philip E; Lukacs, Susan L; Mackey, Lisa; Grohskopf, Lisa A; Patel, Anita; Petersen, Lyle R",Emerg Infect Dis,,251

Using examples from wildlife markets and forest extraction, we call for environment, resource, and development economists to develop and analyze empirically-grounded models of people’s decisions about interacting with the environment, with particular attention to LMIC settings and ecological-epidemiological risk factors. Integrating the decisions that drive human–environment interactions with ecological and epidemiological research in an interdisciplinary approach to understanding pathogen transmission will inform policy needed to improve both conservation and disease spread outcomes.","Albers, Heidi J.; Lee, Katherine D.; Rushlow, Jennifer R.; Zambrana-Torrselio, Carlos",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-020-00449-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836831/,251

592967,Cationic drugs and COVID-19,2020-10-13,"BACKGROUND: A core evaluation framework that captures the health care and societal benefits of value added medicines (VAMs, also often called repurposed medicines) was proposed in Report 1, aiming to reduce the heterogeneity in value assessment processes across countries and to create incentives for manufacturers to invest into incremental innovation. However, this can be impactful only if the framework can be adapted to heterogeneous health care financing systems in different jurisdictions, and the cost of evidence generation necessitated by the framework takes into account the anticipated benefits for the health care system and rewards for the developers. AREAS COVERED: The framework could potentially improve the pricing and reimbursement decisions of VAMs by adapting it to different country specific decision-contexts such as deliberative processes, augmented cost-effectiveness frameworks or formal multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); alternatively, some of its domains may be added to current general evaluation frameworks of medicines. The proposed evaluation framework may provide a starting point for practices based on which VAMs can be exempted from generic pricing mechanisms or can be integrated into the reimbursement and procurement system, allowing for price differentiation according to their added value. Besides evidence from RCTs, pricing and reimbursement decision processes of VAMs should allow for ex-ante non-RCT evidence for certain domains. Alternatively, relying on ex-post evidence agreements—such as outcome guarantee or coverage with evidence development—can also reduce decision uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: The core evaluation framework for VAMs could trigger changes in the existing pricing, reimbursement and procurement practices by improving the appraisal of the added value created by incremental innovation.","Kaló, Zoltán; Petykó, Zsuzsanna Ida; Fricke, Frank-Ulrich; Maniadakis, Nikos; Tesař, Tomáš; Podrazilová, Kateřina; Espin, Jaime; Inotai, András",Cost Eff Resour Alloc,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12962-021-00296-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34266465/,251

We assessed the acceptability and utility of an online pediatric-adapted liking survey (PALS) and tailored messages among children receiving non-urgent care in a pediatric emergency department (PED). Two hundred and forty-five children (average age = 10 years, racially/ethnically diverse, 34% overweight/obese from measured indices, 25% of families reporting food insecurity) and their parents/caregivers participated. Each reported the child’s activity and behaviors using the online PALS and received two to three messages tailored to the responses (aligned with elaboration likelihood and transtheoretical models) to motivate behavioral improvements or reinforce healthy behaviors. Most children and parents (>90%) agreed the PALS was easy to complete, encouraging thought about their own/child’s behaviors. The child’s PALS responses appeared reasonable (fair-to-good child–parent intraclass correlations). Most children and parents (≥75%) reported the tailored messages to be helpful and favorable for improving or maintaining the targeted behavior. Neither message type (motivating/reinforcing) nor favorability responses varied significantly by the child’s weight or family’s food security status. In summary, children and parents found the PALS with tailored messages acceptable and useful.

594165,"Health Risk Assessment of Heavy Metals (Pb, Cd, Hg) in Hydroalcoholic Gels of Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire",2021-09-07,"Abstract Seven to eight species of viral subgenomic mRNAs are produced in coronavirus-infected cells. These mRNAs are produced in different quantities, and their molar ratios remain constant during viral replication. We studied RNA elements that affect coronavirus transcription efficiency by characterizing a series of cloned coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) defective interfering (DI) RNAs containing an inserted intergenic sequence, from which subgenomic DI RNA is transcribed in MHV-infected cells. Certain combinations of upstream and downstream flanking sequences of the intergenic sequence suppressed subgenomic DI RNA transcription, yet changing one of the flanking sequences to a different sequence eliminated transcription suppression. The suppressive effect of certain combinations of flanking sequences, but not all combinations, could be counteracted by altering the intergenic sequence. Thus, the combination of intergenic sequence and flanking sequence affected transcription efficiency. We also characterized another set of DI RNAs designed to clarify which transcription step determines the relative molar ratios of coronavirus mRNAs. Our study indicated that if subgenomic mRNAs were exclusively synthesized from negative-strand genomic RNA, then the relative molar ratios of coronavirus mRNAs were most likely determined after synthesis of the genomic-sized template RNA. If negative-strand subgenomic RNAs were templates for subgenomic mRNAs, then the relative molar ratios of coronavirus mRNAs probably were determined after synthesis of the genomic-sized template RNA used for subgenomic-sized RNA transcription but prior to the completion of the synthesis of subgenomic-sized RNAs containing the leader sequence. The relative molar ratios of coronavirus mRNAs, therefore, seem to have been established prior to a putative replicon-type amplification of subgenomic mRNAs.","An, Sungwhan; Makino, Shinji",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9527929/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682298990596; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682298990596,251

Maintaining these women on sublingual (SL) buprenorphine (BUP) is an evidence-based practice but BUP-SL is associated with several disadvantages that an extended-release (XR) BUP formulation could eliminate. The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) is conducting an intent-to-treat, two-arm, open-label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial, Medication treatment for Opioid-dependent expectant Mothers (MOMs), to compare mother and infant outcomes of pregnant women with OUD treated with BUP-XR, relative to BUP-SL. A second aim is to determine the relative economic value of utilizing BUP-XR. Approximately 300 pregnant women with an estimated gestational age (EGA) of 6–30 weeks, recruited from 12 sites, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to BUP-XR or BUP-SL, balancing on site, EGA, and BUP-SL status (taking/not taking) at the time of randomization. Participants will be provided with study medication and attend weekly medication visits through 12 months postpartum. Participants will be invited to participate in two sub-studies to evaluate the: 1) mechanisms by which BUP-XR may improve mother and infant outcomes; and 2) effects of prenatal exposure to BUP-XR versus BUP-SL on infant neurodevelopment. This paper describes the key design decisions for the main trial made during protocol development.

This is most clearly manifest, and most studied, with respect to a relatively small range of electromagnetic radiation that includes the visible wavelengths with abutting ultraviolet and infrared, and mostly with respect to the visual system. Many aspects of our biology, however, respond to wavelength differences over a wide range of the EM spectrum. Further, humans are now exposed to a variety of modern lighting situations that has, effectively, increased our exposure to wavelengths that were once likely minimal (e.g., “blue” light from devices at night).

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, motivational qualities of 164 3rd year medical students, who participated in four mandatory simulation-based training and two seminars of the department of anaesthesiology, were assessed. Comparative analysis was made to determine differences and changes of motivation towards participating in each teaching unit and each teaching format, using a one-way analysis of variance and unpaired t-tests. RESULTS: The different motivational qualities, as well as the computed levels of autonomous and controlled motivation of students towards participating in each of the six teaching units and each teaching format did not differ significantly (F ((5, 839) )= 0.66, p = 0.657; F ((5, 839)) = 0.29, p = 0.920; (t ((843)) = - 0.72, p = 0.471; t ((843) )= -0.17, p = 0.868). Students` motivation, particularly autonomous motivation, did not enhance after participating in the first SBME, (t ((264)) = 1.035, p = 0.301), after participating in the second SBME, (t ((254)) = -0.055, p = 0.956), or after participating in the third training (t ((250) )= -0.881, p = 0.379). CONCLUSIONS: Simulation-based medical education provides a valuable teaching approach but, in this study, this teaching approach did not enhance nor stimulate student motivation. Therefore, simulation-based medical education equals classical teaching approaches regarding student motivation. Further investigations are needed to identify how simulation-based medical education could enhance medical students' motivation.","Moll-Khosrawi, Parisa; Zöllner, Christian; Cronje, Jonathan S.; Schulte-Uentrop, Leonie",Int J Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34212864/; https://doi.org/10.5116/ijme.60c0.981e,251

While it is well-documented that health literacy is associated with health outcomes, most findings are generated from cross-sectional data. Along with the increasing importance of health literacy in policy, there is a lack of specificity and transparency about how to improve health literacy in practice. In this study, we are calling for a shift of current research paradigms from judging health literacy levels towards observing how health literacy skills are developed over the life course and practised in the real world. This includes using a life-course approach, integrating the rationale of precision public health, applying open science practice, and promoting actionable knowledge translation strategies. We show how a greater appreciation for these paradigms promises to advance health literacy research and practice towards an equitable, precise, transparent, and actionable vision.","Guo, Shuaijun; Yu, Xiaoming; Okan, Orkan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17207650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33092206/,251

Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death. METHODS: In this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison. RESULTS: A total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care. Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P<0.001). The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization. In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs. 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs. 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs. 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.55). CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.

600536,Addressing post-operative Mask-Associated Dry Eye (MADE),2020-11-13,"The cell surface receptor Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) was recently identified as a host factor for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is cleaved into two segments, the S1 (res. 1-685) and the S2 (res. 686-1273) domain by furin protease. Nrp1 predominantly binds to the C-terminal RRAR motif (res. 682-685) of the S1 domain. In this study, we firstly modeled the association of a Nrp1 protein (consisting of domains a2-b1-b2) with the Spike protein. Next, we studied the separation of S2 from the S1 domain, with and without Nrp1 bound, by utilizing molecular dynamics pulling simulations. During the separation, Nrp1 stabilizes the S1 C-terminal region (res. 640-685) and thereby assists the detachment of S2 N-terminal region (res. 686-700). Without Nrp1 bound, S1 tends to become stretched and thus the bound Nrp1 stimulates the earlier separation of S2 from the S1 domain. The liberated S2 domain is known to mediate the fusion of virus and host membranes, thus Nrp1 likely increases virus infectivity by facilitating the S1/S2 separation. We further analyzed the possible topological structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein when bound with Nrp1 and ACE2. Understanding of such a Nrp1-assisted viral infection opens the gate for the generation of protein-protein inhibitors, such as antibodies, which could attenuate the infection mechanism and protect certain cells in a future Nrp1:ACE2 targeted combination therapy.","Zhen-lu, Li; Matthias, Buck",Biophys J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34087218/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2021.05.026,251
601824,Monocyte-Derived Macrophages Contribute to Chitinase Dysregulation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Pilot Study,2021-05-14,"Interferons (IFNs) constitute the first line of defense against microbial infections particularly against viruses. They provide antiviral properties to cells by inducing the expression of hundreds of genes known as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The two most important IFNs that can be produced by virtually all cells in the body during intrinsic innate immune response belong to two distinct families: the type I and type III IFNs. The type I IFN receptor is ubiquitously expressed whereas the type III IFN receptor’s expression is limited to epithelial cells and a subset of immune cells. While originally considered to be redundant, type III IFNs have now been shown to play a unique role in protecting mucosal surfaces against pathogen challenges. The mucosal specific functions of type III IFN do not solely rely on the restricted epithelial expression of its receptor but also on the distinct means by which type III IFN mediates its anti-pathogen functions compared to the type I IFN. In this review we first provide a general overview on IFNs and present the similarities and differences in the signal transduction pathways leading to the expression of either type I or type III IFNs. By highlighting the current state-of-knowledge of the two archetypical mucosal surfaces (e.g. the respiratory and intestinal epitheliums), we present the differences in the signaling cascades used by type I and type III IFNs to uniquely induce the expression of ISGs. We then discuss in detail the role of each IFN in controlling pathogen infections in intestinal and respiratory epithelial cells. Finally, we provide our perspective on novel concepts in the field of IFN (stochasticity, response heterogeneity, cellular polarization/differentiation and tissue microenvironment) that we believe have implications in driving the differences between type I and III IFNs and could explain the preferences for type III IFNs at mucosal surfaces.","Stanifer, Megan L.; Guo, Cuncai; Doldan, Patricio; Boulant, Steeve",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.608645; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33362795/,251

However, in the focus solely on physical health and survival, procedures whose main benefits advance components of well‐being beyond health, including self‐determination, personal security, economic stability, equal respect, and creation of meaningful social relationships, have been disproportionately deprioritized. We describe how female reproduction‐related procedures, including abortion, surgical sterilization, reversible contraception devices and in vitro fertilization, have been broadly categorized as “elective,” a designation that fails to capture the value of these procedures or their impact on women's overall well‐being. We argue that corresponding restrictions and delays of these procedures are problematically reflective of underlying structural views that marginalize women's rights and interests and therefore threaten to propagate gender injustice during the pandemic and beyond.

However, most emergency physicians are unfamiliar with the evidence of benefits demonstrated by home hospital services, especially for older adults. Therefore, the lead author solicited narrative inputs on this topic from selected experts in emergency medicine and home hospital services with clinical experience, publications, and funding on home hospital care.

Interaction between spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptor on the cells is a potential factor in the infectivity of a host. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain with its receptor - ACE2, in different hosts was evaluated to understand and predict viral entry. The protein and nucleotide sequences of ACE2 were initially compared across different species to identify key differences among them. The ACE2 receptor of various species was homology modeled (6LZG as a reference) and its binding ability to the spike receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed. Initially, the spike binding properties of ACE2 of known infected and uninfected species was compared with each Order (of animals) as a group. Finally, a logistic regression model vis-a-vis the spike binding properties of ACE2 (Interaction energy, entropy sidechain and entropy mainchain) was constructed to predict the probability of viral entry in different hosts. ResultsPhylogeny and alignment comparison did not lead to any meaningful conclusion on viral entry in different hosts. Out of several spike binding properties of ACE2, a significant difference between the known infected and uninfected species was observed for five spike binding properties of ACE2. However, these parameters did not specifically categorize the animals into infected or uninfected, for all the Orders (of animals). The logistic regression model constructed revealed that in the mammalian class, most of the species of Carnivores, Artiodactyls, Perissodactyls, Pholidota, and Primates had high probability of viral entry. However, among the primates, baboons have very low probability of viral entry. Among rodents, hamsters were highly probable for viral entry with rats and mice having a very low probability. Rabbits have a medium probability of viral entry. In Birds, ducks have a very low probability, while chickens seemed to have medium probability and turkey showed the highest probability of viral entry. ConclusionsMost of the species considered in this study showed high probability of viral entry. This study would prompt us to closely follow certain species of animals for determining pathogenic insult by SARS-CoV-2 and for determining their ability to act as a carrier and/or disseminator.","Praharaj, Manas Ranjan; Garg, Priyanka; Khan, Raja Ishaq Nabi; Sharma, Shailesh; Panigrahi, Manjit; Mishra, B P; Mishra, Bina; Kumar, G Sai; Gandham, Ravi Kumar; Singh, Raj Kumar; Majumdar, Subeer; Mohapatra, Trilochan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.084327,251

These include platinum drugs (in 50% of cancer chemotherapies), lithium (bipolar disorders), silver (antimicrobials), and bismuth (broad-spectrum antibiotics). While the quest for novel and better drugs is now as urgent as ever, drug discovery and development pipelines established for organic drugs and based on target identification and high-throughput screening of compound libraries are less effective when applied to metallodrugs. Metallodrugs are often prodrugs which undergo activation by ligand substitution or redox reactions, and are multi-targeting, all of which need to be considered when establishing structure–activity relationships.

SETTING: Malaysian families were invited to answer the questionnaires. The sampling was performed between 12 May 2020 and 9 June 2020. INTERVENTION: The psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Children’s Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES). The mental health status was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) 21. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: (1) Psychological impact on Malaysian families. (2) Prevalence of mental health status of Malaysian families during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULT: A total of 409 Malaysian families have responded (409 parents and 348 children), 154 respondents (38%) reported high psychological impact (score 14) for psychological construct and 189 respondents (46%) reported high psychological impact (score 6) for behavioural construct. A significantly higher proportion of respondents with not permanent employment status of the family lead reported high psychological impact. The prevalence of anxiety reported from family respondents was 23%. Forty-five children answered the DASS-21 questionnaire; 28.5% reported anxiety, 31.4% reported depression and 13.3% reported stress.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 3947 outpatients, from 14 February to 2 March 2020, at nine health facilities in Vietnam. Data collection included sociodemographic characteristics, healthy eating behavior (using the healthy eating score (HES) questionnaire), physical activity (using the short form international physical activity questionnaire), and Slike-CV19S. The associations and interactions were tested using logistic regression models. Results: Frequent intake of fruits (OR = 0.84; p = 0.016), vegetables (OR = 0.72; p = 0.036), and fish (OR = 0.43; p < 0.001) were associated with a lower Slike-CV19S likelihood, as compared with infrequent intake. Patients with higher HES levels (OR = 0.84; p = 0.033 for medium HES; OR = 0.77; p = 0.006 for high HES) or being physically active (OR = 0.69; p < 0.001) had a lower Slike-CV19S likelihood, as compared to those with low HES or physical inactivity, respectively. Patients with medium HES who were physically active (OR = 0.69; p = 0.005), or with high HES and physically active (OR = 0.58; p < 0.001), had a lower Slike-CV19S likelihood, as compared to those with low HES and physical inactivity. Conclusions: Healthy eating behavior and physical activity showed single and combinative impacts on protecting people from Slike-CV19S. Strategic approaches are encouraged to improve healthy behaviors, which may further contribute to containing the pandemic.","Nguyen, Minh H.; Pham, Thu T.

605308,Improving the Process of Screening for Medical Financial Hardship in Oncology Practice,2021,"BACKGROUND: Non-pharmaceutical strategies are vital in curtailing impacts of influenza and have been intensively studied in public health. However, few strategies have explicitly utilized the weekend effect, which has been widely reported to be capable of reducing influenza infections. This study aims to explore six weekend-extension strategies against seasonal and pandemic flu outbreaks. METHODS: The weekend-extension strategies were designed to extend regular two-day weekend by one, two and three days, respectively, and in combination with either a continuous or discontinuous pattern. Their effectiveness was evaluated using an established agent-based spatially explicit simulation model in the urbanized area of Buffalo, NY, US. RESULTS: If the extensions last more than two days, the weekend-extension strategies can remarkably reduce the overall disease attack rate of seasonal flu. Particularly, a three-day continuous extension is sufficient to suppress the epidemic and confine the spread of disease. For the pandemic flu, the weekend-extension strategies only produce a few mitigation effects until the extensions exceed three days. Sensitivity analysis indicated that a compliance level above 75% is necessary for the weekend-extension strategies to take effects. CONCLUSION: This research is the first attempt to incorporate the weekend effect into influenza mitigation strategies. The results suggest that appropriate extensions of the regular two-day weekend can be a potential measure to fight against influenza outbreaks, while minimizing interruptions on normal rhythms of socio-economy. The concept of weekend extension would be particularly useful if there were a lack of vaccine stockpiles, e.g., in countries with limited health resources, or in the case of unknown emerging infectious diseases.","Mao, Liang",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21718518/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-11-522,251

These discussions include also statins treatment. The statins are among the most widely used drugs in the global population. Statins aim to lower cholesterol, which is essential for many biological processes but can lead to heart disease if levels are too high; however, also the pleiotropic effects of statins are well known. So could the anti-inflammatory or the potential antiviral effects of statins be helpful in avoiding extreme inflammation and severity in COVID-19? To date, there are conflicting opinions on the effects of statins in the course of COVID-19 infection. The aim of this article is to describe the molecular and pharmacological basis of the pleiotropic effects of statins that could be more involved in the fight against COVID-19 infection and to investigate the current epidemiological evidence in the literature on the current and important topic.","Vitiello, Antonio; Ferrara, Francesco",Cardiovasc Toxicol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12012-021-09674-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34255300/,251

Basic Ventilator Parameters,2020-04-09,"Background In England, hospitalisations and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 have been falling consistently since January 2021 during the third national lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first significant relaxation of that lockdown occurred on 8 March when schools reopened. Methods The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study augments routine surveillance data for England by measuring swab-positivity for SARS-CoV-2 in the community. The current round, round 10, collected swabs from 11 to 30 March 2021 and is compared here to round 9, in which swabs were collected from 4 to 23 February 2021. Results During round 10, we estimated an R number of 1.00 (95% confidence interval 0.81, 1.21). Between rounds 9 and 10 we estimated national prevalence has dropped by ~60% from 0.49% (0.44%, 0.55%) in February to 0.20% (0.17%, 0.23%) in March. There were substantial falls in weighted regional prevalence: in South East from 0.36% (0.29%, 0.44%) in round 9 to 0.07% (0.04%, 0.12%) in round 10; London from 0.60% (0.48%, 0.76%) to 0.16% (0.10%, 0.26%); East of England from 0.47% (0.36%, 0.60%) to 0.15% (0.10%, 0.24%); East Midlands from 0.59% (0.45%, 0.77%) to 0.19% (0.13%, 0.28%); and North West from 0.69% (0.54%, 0.88%) to 0.31% (0.21%, 0.45%). Areas of apparent higher prevalence remain in parts of the North West, and Yorkshire and The Humber. The highest prevalence in March was found among school-aged children 5 to 12 years at 0.41% (0.27%, 0.62%), compared with the lowest in those aged 65 to 74 and 75 and over at 0.09% (0.05%, 0.16%). The close approximation between prevalence of infections and deaths (suitably lagged) is diverging, suggesting that infections may have resulted in fewer hospitalisations and deaths since the start of widespread vaccination. Conclusion We report a sharp decline in prevalence of infections between February and March 2021. We did not observe an increase in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 following the reopening of schools in England, although the decline of prevalence appears to have stopped. Future rounds of REACT-1 will be able to measure the rate of growth or decline from this current plateau and hence help assess the effectiveness of the vaccination roll-out on transmission of the virus as well as the potential size of any third wave during the ensuing months.","Riley, S.; Eales, O.; Haw, D.; Walters, C.

This study explores shoppers’ behavioural changes in relation to self-service, using the special research context of e-commerce self-collection services. By synthesising insights from the health psychology literature, this study proposes an affective-cognitive-social perspective to explain the pandemic-driven behavioural changes of self-collection users. The survey instrument is used for online data collection (n = 500), and a combined (descriptive and quantitative) method is adopted for data analysis. Our results suggest that, although with a relatively weak predictive power, the affective and cognitive appraisals of health risks lead to the reinforced usage of self-collection service. This also applies to the factors of action/coping planning and subjective norm.

In response to the call to take into consideration contextual and institutional factors, it draws from the stakeholder theory and the organizational support theory to investigate how internal and external organizational processes could influence organizational commitment. The quantitative data collected from over 200 nonprofit employees revealed that organizational commitment was positively related to engaged leadership, community engagement effort, degree of formalization in daily operations, and perceived intangible support for employees. Further analysis showed that tangible support measured as perceived fair pay has an indirect effect, which is contingent upon how well the nonprofits engage with internal and external stakeholders. Findings suggest that nonprofit employees’ personal tangible gains may come second when assessing their commitment to the organization; instead, how well their employer manages stakeholder relationships in a larger community plays a more significant role.","Wang, Rong",Voluntas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33686322/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11266-021-00336-8,251
608687,It's time for an evolution,2021-01-28,"BACKGROUND: The pleiotropic effects of statins may reduce the severity of COVID-19 disease. This study aims to determine the association between inpatient statin use and severe disease outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially those with Diabetes Mellitus (DM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study on hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The primary outcome was mortality during hospitalization. Patients were classified into statin and non-statin groups based on the administration of statins during hospitalization. Analysis included multivariable regression analysis adjusting for confounders and propensity score matching to achieve a 1:1 balanced cohort. Subgroup analyses based on presence of DM were conducted. RESULTS: In the cohort of 922 patients, 413 had a history of DM. About 27.1% patients (n = 250) in the total cohort (TC) and 32.9% patients (n = 136) in DM cohort received inpatient statins. Atorvastatin (n = 205, 82%) was the most commonly prescribed statin medication in TC. On multivariable analysis in TC, inpatient statin group had reduced mortality compared to the non-statin group (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.90; p = 0.01). DM modified this association between inpatient statins and mortality. Patients with DM who received inpatient statins had reduced mortality (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.21–0.61; p < 0.001). However, no such association was noted among patients without DM (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.67–2.17; p = 0.52). These results were further validated using propensity score matching. CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient statin use was associated with significant reduction in mortality among COVID-19 patients especially those with DM. These findings support the pursuit of randomized clinical trials and inpatient statin use appears safe among COVID-19 patients.

608814,Immunogenicity of novel mRNA COVID-19 vaccine MRT5500 in mice and non-human primates,2020-10-14,"BACKGROUND INFORMATION: The interferon (IFN)‐inducible protein TRIM22 (Staf50) is a member of the tripartite motif protein family and has been suggested a role in the regulation of viral replication as well as of protein ubiquitylation. In addition, we have previously shown that TRIM22 is a direct target gene for the tumour suppressor p53. Consistently, over‐expression of TRIM22 inhibits the clonogenic growth of monoblastic U937 cells, suggesting anti‐proliferative or cell death‐inducing effects. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that TRIM22 directly or indirectly interacts with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)4E, and inhibits the binding of eIF4E to eIF4G, thus disturbing the assembly of the eIF4F complex, which is necessary for cap‐dependent translation. Furthermore, TRIM22 exerts a repressive effect on luciferase reporter protein levels and to some extent on radiolabelled methionine incorporation. Even though all nuclear mRNAs are capped, some are more dependent on eIF4F than others for translation. The translation of one of these mRNAs, IRF‐7C, was indeed found to be repressed in the presence of TRIM22. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest TRIM22 to repress protein translation preferably of some specific mRNAs. Taken together, we show that TRIM22 represses translation by inhibiting the binding of eIF4E to eIF4G, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of protein translation, which may be of importance in response to p53 and/or IFN signalling.","Petersson, Jessica; Ageberg, Malin; Sandén, Carl; Olofsson, Tor; Gullberg, Urban; Drott, Kristina",Biol Cell,https://doi.org/10.1111/boc.201100099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22509910/,251

Unprecedented measures to slow down and prevent the transmission of COVID-19 have had various impacts on the population’s health behaviour and mental health. The main purpose of the present study is to investigate the lockdown’s effects on university students’ mental health in Romania. Based on a cross-sectional design, the survey data were collected from a sample of 722 participants (247 males; M = 21.1 years; SD ± 1.73). A path analysis was performed to verify the hypothesised direct and indirect effects included in the multiple mediation model. The findings showed a positive association between stress and boredom proneness, missing daily social interactions, spending more time on phone conversations, and the increasing interest in following news about the pandemic. The path analysis revealed an excellent fit between the proposed multiple mediation model and the sample data. Boredom proneness and missing daily social interactions both affected stress, directly and indirectly, through more time spent on phone conversations. In addition, it was found that the increased interest in following news about the pandemic mediated the relationship between boredom proneness and perceived stress. In terms of gender differences, our findings revealed that female students experienced significantly higher stress levels than male students, perceived to a greater extent the lack of daily social interactions, and spent more time on phone conversations. Overall, the findings further extend the empirical evidence on university students’ mental health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, universities need to organise support programmes focused on developing university students’ coping strategies to maintain their mental health even in adverse contexts.","Dumitrache, Liliana; Stănculescu, Elena; Nae, Mariana; Dumbrăveanu, Daniela; Simion, Gabriel; Taloș, Ana Maria; Mareci, Alina",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444348/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168599,251

610939,Sharing CD4+ T Cell Loss: When COVID-19 and HIV Collide on Immune System,2020-12-15,"Background: Finding the ideal candidate for a residency/fellowship program has always been difficult. Finding the “perfect” match has always been the ultimate goal. However, many factors affect obtaining that “perfect” match. In the past, we would have each attending physician review around 20 to 50 Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) applications and rank them into three categories: high, middle, or low. Depending on their ranking, the applicant would be invited for an interview. After the interview, the applicants’ files (ERAS and interview) would be reviewed and ranked by the faculty as a group. This was time-consuming and fraught with too much subjectivity and minimal objectivity. We, therefore, sought to find a way to assess and rank applicants in a more objective and less time-consuming manner. By creating a customizable scoring tool, we were able to screen applicants to our pulmonary/critical care fellowship program in an efficient and a more objective manner. Objectives: A customizable scoring tool was developed weighting components in the ERAS and interview process, allowing residency/fellowship programs to create a final rank list consistent with the programs’ desired applicants. Methods: Two hundred and sixty pulmonary/critical care fellowship applications were reviewed from 2013 to 2018. In 2018, we used our new scoring rubric to create a rank list and rescore previous applicants. The traditional and new lists were compared to the final rank list submitted to the National Residency Matching Program (NRMP) for 2018. We wanted to ascertain which scoring method correlated best with the final rank list submitted to the NRMP. We obtained feedback from eight faculty members who had reviewed applicants with both scoring tools. Results: The novel customizable scoring tool positively correlated with the final rank list submitted to the NRMP (r= 0.86). The novel tool showed a better correlation to the final rank list than the traditional method. Faculties (6/6, 100%) responded positively to the new tool. Conclusions: Our new customizable tool has allowed us to create a final rank list that is efficient and more focused on our faculty’s desired applicants. We hope to assess and compare the quality of applicants matched through this scoring system and the traditional method by using faculty evaluations, milestones, and test scores.","Ie, Susanti R; Ratcliffe, Jessica L; Rubio, Catalina; Zhang, Kermit S; Shaver, Katherine; Musick, David W",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.15396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34249546/,251

The University of Guelph recently conducted a five-year outcome assessment using the Core Competencies for Public Health in Canada as an evaluative framework to determine whether graduates are receiving adequate training, and identify areas for improvement. METHODS: A curriculum map of core courses and an online survey of University of Guelph Master of Public Health graduates comprised the outcome assessment. The curriculum map was constructed by evaluating course outlines, assignments, and content to determine the extent to which the Core Competencies were covered in each course. Quantitative survey results were characterized using descriptive statistics. Qualitative survey results were analyzed to identify common themes and patterns in open-ended responses. RESULTS: The University of Guelph Master of Public Health program provided a positive learning environment in which graduates gained proficiency across the Core Competencies through core and elective courses, meaningful practicums, and competent faculty. Practice-based learning environments, particularly in collaboration with public health organizations, were deemed to be beneficial to students’ learning experiences. CONCLUSIONS: The Core Competencies and graduate surveys can be used to conduct a meaningful and informative outcome assessment. We encourage other Master of Public Health programs to conduct their own outcome assessments using a similar framework, and disseminate these results in order to identify best practices and strengthen the Canadian graduate public health education system.","Britten, Nicole; Wallar, Lauren E; McEwen, Scott A; Papadopoulos, Andrew",BMC Med Educ,https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6920-14-158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25078124/,251

Among them, selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) represents a safe, flexible and effective treatment. Purpose of this study is to present our experience with SIRT during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic and provide an overview of the indications and challenges of SIRT in this scenario. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the number of patients evaluated by Multidisciplinary Liver Tumor Board (MLTB) and who were undergoing LDTs between March and July 2020 and compared it with 2019. For patients treated with SIRT, clinical data, treatment details and the best radiological response were collected. Results: Compared to 2019, we observed a 27.5% reduction in the number of patients referred to MLTB and a 28.3% decrease in percutaneous ablations; transarterial chemoembolizations were stable, while SIRT increased by 64%. The majority of SIRT patients (75%) had primary tumors, mostly HCC. The best objective response and disease control rates were 56.7% and 72.2%, respectively. Conclusion: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was characterized by an increased demand for SIRT, which represents a safe, flexible and effective treatment, whose manageability will further improve by simplifying the treatment workflow, developing user-friendly and reliable tools for personalized dosimetry and improving interdisciplinary communication.","Bargellini, Irene; Boni, Giuseppe; Traino, Antonio Claudio; Bozzi, Elena; Lorenzoni, Giulia; Bianchi, Francesca; Cervelli, Rosa; Depalo, Tommaso; Crocetti, Laura; Volterrani, Duccio; Cioni, Roberto",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34640332/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10194315,251

However, the duration and effectiveness of the protection conferred by the immune response remains to be assessed in population-based samples. To estimate the incidence of newly acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections in seropositive individuals as compared to seronegative controls we conducted a retrospective longitudinal matched study. METHODS: A seroprevalence survey including a representative sample of the population was conducted in Geneva, Switzerland between April and June 2020, immediately after the first pandemic wave. Seropositive participants were matched one-to-two to seronegative controls, using a propensity-score including age, gender, immunodeficiency, BMI, smoking status and education level. Each individual was linked to a state-registry of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our primary outcome was confirmed infections occurring from serological status assessment to the end of the second pandemic wave (January 2021). RESULTS: Among 8344 serosurvey participants, 498 seropositive individuals were selected and matched with 996 seronegative controls. After a mean follow-up of 35.6 (SD 3.2) weeks, 7 out of 498 (1.4%) seropositive subjects had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, of whom 5 (1.0%) were classified as reinfections. In contrast, the infection rate was higher in seronegative individuals (15.5%, 154/996) during a similar follow-up period (mean 34.7 [SD 3.2] weeks), corresponding to a 94% (95%CI 86% to 98%, P<0.001) reduction in the hazard of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test for seropositives. CONCLUSIONS: Seroconversion after SARS-CoV-2 infection confers protection against reinfection lasting at least 8 months.

SARS-CoV-2 has a wide tropism and detection of the virus has been described in multiple specimen types, including various respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, and stool. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of a laboratory modified CDCbased SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 assay across a range of sample types. Study Design We compared the matrix effect on the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection by qRT-PCR in nasal swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), sputum, plasma, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), stool, VTM, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Initial limits of detection (LoD) were subsequently narrowed to confirm an LoD for each specimen type and target gene. RESULTS: LoDs were established using a modified CDC-based laboratory developed test and ranged from a mean CT cut-off of 33.8-35.7 (10-20 copies/reaction) for the N1 gene target, and 34.0-36.2 (1-10 copies/reaction) for N2. Alternatives to VTM such as PBS and HBSS had comparable LoDs. The N2 gene target was found to be most sensitive in CSF. CONCLUSION: A modified CDC-based laboratory developed test is able to detect SARSCoV- 2 accurately with similar sensitivity across all sample types tested.","Perchetti, Garrett A.; Nalla, Arun K.; Huang, Meei-Li; Zhu, Haiying; Wei, Yulun; Stensland, Larry; Loprieno, Michelle A.; Jerome, Keith R.; Greninger, Alexander L.",J Clin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32470887/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301803; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301803?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104438,251

Estimating this trajectory from data on numbers of deaths is complicated by the delay between deaths occurring and their being reported to the authorities. In England, Public Health England receives death reports from a number of sources and the reporting delay is typically several days, but can be several weeks. Delayed reporting results in considerable uncertainty about the number of deaths that occurred on the most recent days. In this article, we estimate the number of deaths per day in each of five age strata within seven English regions. We use a Bayesian hierarchical model that involves a submodel for the number of deaths per day and a submodel for the reporting delay distribution. This model accounts for reporting-day effects and longer-term changes over time in the delay distribution. We show how the model can be fitted in a computationally efficient way when the delay distribution is same in multiple strata, e.g. over a wide range of ages.","Seaman, S.; Samartsidis, P.; Kall, M.; De Angelis, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20194209v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.15.20194209,251

We aimed to investigate if frontline healthcare workers affected by infodemia show different psychological consequences than frontline clinicians who do not declare to be affected by false news related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: One hundred twenty-six frontline healthcare workers from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Emergency Departments in Romania completed a survey to assess stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders, between March and April 2020. We split the sample of frontline healthcare workers into two groups based on the self-evaluated criteria: if they were or were not affected by infodemia in their activity. Results: Considering limitations such as the cross-sectional design, the lack of causality relationship, and the sample size, the results show that, the frontline medical workers who declared to be affected by false news were significantly more stressed, felt more anxiety, and suffered more from insomnia than healthcare workers who are not affected by false information related to pandemic time. Conclusions: The infodemia has significant psychological consequences such as stress, anxiety, and insomnia on already overwhelmed doctors and nurses in the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis. These findings suggest that medical misinformation’s psychological implications must be considered when different interventions regarding frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic are implemented.","Secosan, Ica; Virga, Delia; Crainiceanu, Zorin Petrisor; Bratu, Lavinia Melania; Bratu, Tiberiu",Medicina (Kaunas),https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina56120679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33317190/,251

In addition, the satisfaction levels of patients and doctors with the application of telemedicine in COVID-19 were investigated, the deficiencies of telemedicine in Gansu were determined, and recommendations for modification were proposed. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has broken out in China, and Gansu Province in Northwest of China has not been spared. To date, there are 91 local COVID-19 cases and 42 imported cases. 109 hospitals were selected as designated hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak, and most of them were secondary hospitals. However, it was unsatisfactory that the ability of medical services is relatively low in most of secondary hospitals and primary hospitals. Therefore, we helped the secondary hospitals cope with COVID-19 by means of remote consultation, long-distance education, telemedicine question and answer (Q&A). Our practical experience shows that telemedicine can be widely used during the COVID-19 epidemic, especially in developing countries and areas with lagging medical standards.","Wang, Yan; Yang, Jie; Ma, Huijuan; Dong, Xinchun; Xie, Guangmei; Ye, Songning; Du, Juan",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34347779/,251
613786,Continuous saliva suction tube to prevent aspiration pneumonia during upper GI endoscopy,2020-12-10,"To date, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected over 100 million people globally. COVID-19 can present with a variety of different symptoms leading to manifestation of disease ranging from mild cases to a life-threatening condition requiring critical care-level support. At present, a rapid prediction of disease severity and critical care requirement in COVID-19 patients, in early stages of disease, remains an unmet challenge. Therefore, we assessed whether parameters from a routine clinical hematology workup, at the time of hospital admission, can be valuable predictors of COVID-19 severity and the requirement for critical care. Hematological data from the day of hospital admission (day of positive COVID-19 test) for patients with severe COVID-19 disease (requiring critical care during illness) and patients with non-severe disease (not requiring critical care) were acquired. The data were amalgamated and cleaned and modeling was performed. Using a decision tree model, we demonstrated that routine clinical hematology parameters are important predictors of COVID-19 severity. This proof-of-concept study shows that a combination of activated partial thromboplastin time, white cell count-to-neutrophil ratio, and platelet count can predict subsequent severity of COVID-19 with high sensitivity and specificity (area under ROC 0.9956) at the time of the patient's hospital admission. These data, pending further validation, indicate that a decision tree model with hematological parameters could potentially form the basis for a rapid risk stratification tool that predicts COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients.","Szklanna, Paulina B.; Altaie, Haidar; Comer, Shane P.; Cullivan, Sarah; Kelliher, Sarah; Weiss, Luisa; Curran, John; Dowling, Emmet; O'Reilly, Katherine M.

Most coronaviruses show a strong species specificity, although the SARS-Coronavirus crossed species from palm civet cats to infect humans. Similarly, HCoV-OC43, likely a member of the same coronavirus group as SARS-CoV, readily crossed the species barrier as evidenced by its rapid adaptation to the murine brain [McIntosh, K., Becker, W.B., Chanock, R.M., 1967. Growth in suckling-mouse brain of “IBV-like” viruses from patients with upper respiratory tract disease. Proc Natl Acad Sci U.S.A. 58, 2268–73]. Herein, we investigated two consequences of this plasticity in species tropism. First, we showed that HCoV-OC43 was able to infect cells from a large number of mammalian species. Second, we showed that virus that was passed exclusively in suckling mouse brains was highly virulent and caused a uniformly fatal encephalitis in adult mice. The surface glycoprotein is a major virulence factor in most coronavirus infections. We identified three changes in the HCoV-OC43 surface glycoprotein that correlated with enhanced neurovirulence in mice; these were located in the domain of the protein responsible for binding to host cells. These data suggest that some coronaviruses, including HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV, readily adapt to growth in cells from heterologous species. This adaptability has facilitated the isolation of HCoV-OC43 viral variants with markedly differing abilities to infect animals and tissue culture cells.","Butler, Noah; Pewe, Lecia; Trandem, Kathryn; Perlman, Stanley",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16413043/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682205007920; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682205007920,251

In this study, six non-human primates received a prime-boost intramuscular vaccination with 4 μg of mRNA vaccine candidate CV07050101, which encodes a pre-fusion stabilized spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Boost vaccination was performed 28 days post prime vaccination. As a control, six animals were similarly injected with PBS. Humoral and cellular immune responses were investigated at time of vaccination, and two weeks afterwards. No antibodies could be detected two and four weeks after prime vaccination. Two weeks after boost vaccination, binding but no neutralizing antibodies were detected in 4 out of 6 non-human primates.

This has led to a drastic change in the routine management of non-communicable diseases with a potential long-term impact on patient health care. We investigated the management of non-COVID-19 patients across all medical specialties during the pandemic in Italy. Methods: A PRISMA guideline-based systematic review of the available literature was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus, restricting the search to the main outbreak period in Italy (from 20 February to 22 June, 2020). We selected articles in English or Italian that detailed changes in the Italian hospital care for non-COVID-19 patients due to the pandemic. Our keywords included all medical specialties in combination with our geographical focus (Italy) and COVID-19. Findings: Of the 4643 potentially eligible studies identified by the search, 247 studies were included in the systematic review. A decrease in the management of emergencies in non-COVID patients was found together with an increase in mortality. Similarly, non-deferrable conditions met a tendency toward decreased diagnosis. All specialties have been affected by the reorganization of healthcare provision in the hub-and-spoke system and have benefited from telemedicine during the pandemic. Interpretation: Our work highlights the changes taking place in the Italian public healthcare system in order to tackle the developing health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

616583,Summer COVID-19 third wave: faster high altitude spread suggests high UV adaptation,2020-08-21,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is the best-known acute phase protein. In humans, almost every type of inflammation is accompanied by an increase of CRP concentration. Until recently, the only known physiological function of CRP was the marking of cells to initiate their phagocytosis. This triggers the classical complement pathway up to C4, which helps to eliminate pathogens and dead cells. However, vital cells with reduced energy supply are also marked, which is useful in the case of a classical external wound because an important substrate for pathogens is disposed of, but is counterproductive at internal wounds (e.g., heart attack or stroke). This mechanism negatively affects clinical outcomes since it is established that CRP levels correlate with the prognosis of these indications. Here, we summarize what we can learn from a clinical study in which CRP was adsorbed from the bloodstream by CRP-apheresis. Recently, it was shown that CRP can have a direct effect on blood pressure in rabbits. This is interesting in regard to patients with high inflammation, as they often become tachycardic and need catecholamines. These two physiological effects of CRP apparently also occur in COVID-19. Parts of the lung become ischemic due to intra-alveolar edema and hemorrhage and in parallel CRP increases dramatically, hence it is assumed that CRP is also involved in this ischemic condition. It is meanwhile considered that most of the damage in COVID-19 is caused by the immune system. The high amounts of CRP could have an additional influence on blood pressure in severe COVID-19.","Sheriff, Ahmed; Kayser, Stefan; Brunner, Patrizia; Vogt, Birgit",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.630430; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33679775/,251

This article addresses how guidance for ophthalmologists on managing patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) during the pandemic should be adapted to the local epidemic pressure, with more or less stringent measures implemented according to the ebb and flow of the pandemic. METHODS: The Vision Academy’s membership of international retinal disease experts analyzed guidance for anti-VEGF intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 pandemic and graded the recommendations according to three levels of increasing epidemic pressure. The revised recommendations were discussed, refined, and voted on by the 14-member Vision Academy Steering Committee for consensus. RESULTS: Protocols to minimize the exposure of patients and healthcare staff to COVID-19, including use of personal protective equipment, physical distancing, and hygiene measures, should be routinely implemented and intensified according to local infection rates and pressure on the hospital/clinic or healthcare system. In areas with many COVID-19-positive clusters, additional measures including pre-screening of patients, postponement of non-urgent appointments, and simplification of complex intravitreal anti-VEGF regimens should be considered. Treatment prioritization for those at greatest risk of irreversible vision loss should be implemented in areas where COVID-19 cases are increasing exponentially and healthcare resources are strained. CONCLUSION: Consistency in monitoring of local infection rates and adjustment of clinical practice accordingly will be required as we move forward through the COVID-19 era. Ophthalmologists must continue to carefully weigh the risk–benefits to minimize the exposure of patients and healthcare staff to COVID-19, ensure that patients receive sight-saving treatment, and avoid the potential long-term impact of prolonged treatment postponement.

An evaluation of health disparities among patients receiving ophthalmic telemedical care during the pandemic is needed. Objective: To evaluate disparities in the delivery of ophthalmic telemedicine at Massachusetts Eye and Ear (MEE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective, cross-sectional study analyzed clinical visits at a single tertiary eye care center (MEE) from January 1 to December 31, 2020. Patients who had ophthalmology and optometry clinical visits at the MEE during the study period were included. Exposures: Telemedicine vs in-person clinical encounters. Main Outcomes and Measures: Variables associated with use of ophthalmic telemedicine during the study period. Results: A total of 2262 telemedicine ophthalmic encounters for 1911 patients were included in the analysis. The median age of the patients was 61 (interquartile range, 43-72) years, and 1179 (61.70%) were women. With regard to race and ethnicity, 87 patients (4.55%) identified as Asian; 128 (6.70%), as Black or African American; 23 (1.20%), as Hispanic or Latino; and 1455 (76.14%), as White. On multivariate analysis, factors associated with decreased receipt of telemedical care included male sex (odds ratio [OR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.96), Black race (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56-0.86), not speaking English (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48-0.81), educational level of high school or less (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.97), and age (OR per year of age, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.989-0.998). When comparing telephone- and video-based telemedicine visits, decreased participation in video-based visits was associated with age (OR per year of age, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.98), educational level of high school or less (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.29-0.99), being unemployed (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.12-0.68), being retired (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.10-0.42), or having a disability (OR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.04-0.23). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cross-sectional study, though limited to retrospective data from a single university-based practice, suggest that historically marginalized populations were less likely to receive ophthalmic telemedical care compared with in-person care during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Understanding the causes of these disparities might help those who need access to virtual care.","Aziz, Kanza; Moon, Jade Y; Parikh, Ravi; Lorch, Alice C; Friedman, David S; Miller, John B; Armstrong, Grayson W",JAMA ophthalmol.

CDC and Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) LDTs had similar analytical sensitivities for viral pathogens, while several of the bacterial pathogen APHL LDTs demonstrated sensitivities one log higher than the corresponding CDC LDT. When compared to CDC LDTs, TAC assays were generally one to two logs less sensitive depending on the site performing the analysis. Finally, TAC assays were generally more sensitive than their counterparts in three different commercial multi-respiratory panels. TAC technology allows users to spot customized assays and design TAC layout, simplify assay setup, conserve specimen, dramatically reduce contamination potential, and as demonstrated in this study, analyze multiple samples in parallel with good reproducibility between instruments and operators.","Harvey, John J.; Chester, Stephanie; Burke, Stephen A.; Ansbro, Marisela; Aden, Tricia; Gose, Remedios; Sciulli, Rebecca; Bai, Jing; DesJardin, Lucy; Benfer, Jeffrey L.; Hall, Joshua; Smole, Sandra; Doan, Kimberly; Popowich, Michael D.; St. George, Kirsten; Quinlan, Tammy; Halse, Tanya A.; Li, Zhen; Pérez-Osorio, Ailyn C.; Glover, William A.; Russell, Denny; Reisdorf, Erik; Whyte, Thomas; Whitaker, Brett; Hatcher, Cynthia; Srinivasan, Velusamy; Tatti, Kathleen; Tondella, Maria Lucia; Wang, Xin; Winchell, Jonas M.; Mayer, Leonard W.; Jernigan, Daniel; Mawle, Alison C.",J Virol Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26640122/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609341500381X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016609341500381X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.11.020,251
620035,Confidence and Receptivity for COVID-19 Vaccines: A Rapid Systematic Review,2020-12-30,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, students worldwide have experienced fundamental changes to their learning. Schools had to shift to distance education as part of the effort to stop the spread of the virus. Although distance learning undoubtedly resulted in challenges for all students, there is much concern that it exacerbated existing educational inequalities and led to disadvantages – particularly for students who were already struggling academically and lacking support from family and school. The aim of this paper was to investigate the possible impact of family and child characteristics, school performance prior to lockdown, and support at home and from school during lockdown in coping with self-regulated distance learning during times of COVID-19. The paper draws on data from a two-wave longitudinal study surveying 155 lower secondary school students aged 13–14years from a rural-alpine region in Austria. Data were collected 1year before the start of the pandemic and directly after schools had returned to in-class teaching after the first lockdown. Our findings support the notion that distance learning poses a substantial risk for exacerbating existing educational disadvantages. They show that coping with out-of-school learning was especially challenging for students with low academic achievement and learning motivation prior to the pandemic. Furthermore, findings demonstrate that the support from parents and teachers foster students’ capabilities to cope with the self-regulatory demands connected with distance learning. Although the importance of competencies for self-regulated learning became particularly evident in the context of the pandemic, from our findings, it can be concluded that in the future, schools should strengthen their investment in promoting competencies for self-regulated learning. Self-regulation must be recognized as an essential educational skill for academic achievement and life-long learning.","Berger, Fred; Schreiner, Claudia; Hagleitner, Wolfgang; Jesacher-Rößler, Livia; Roßnagl, Susanne; Kraler, Christian",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.701255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34539499/,251

Here we show that SIRPA decreased in vitro infection by a number of pathogenic viruses, including New World and Old World arenaviruses, Zika virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and pseudoviruses bearing the Machupo virus, Ebola virus and SARS-CoV-2 glycoproteins, but not HSV-1, MLV or mNoV. Moreover, mice with targeted mutation of the Sirpa gene that renders it non-functional were more susceptible to infection with the New World arenaviruses Junín virus vaccine strain Candid 1 and Tacaribe virus, but not MLV or mNoV. All SIRPA-inhibited viruses have in common the requirement for trafficking to a low pH endosomal compartment. This was clearly demonstrated with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, which was only inhibited by SIRPA in cells in which it required trafficking to the endosome. Similar to its role in phagocytosis inhibition, SIRPA decreased virus internalization but not binding to cell surface receptors. We also found that increasing SIRPA levels via treatment with IL-4 led to even greater anti-viral activity. These data suggest that enhancing SIRPA’s activity could be a target for anti-viral therapies.","Sarute, Nicolás; Cheng, Han; Yan, Zhonghao; Salas-Briceno, Karen; Richner, Justin; Rong, Lijun; Ross, Susan R.",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34097709/,251

These regulations also reduce biosafety concerns by imposing specific requirements on laboratories working with BSATs. Furthermore, they provide a legal framework for prosecuting someone who possesses a BSAT illegally. With the implementation of these regulations has come discussion in the scientific community about the potential of these regulations to affect the cost of doing BSAT research, hamper research and international collaborations, or whether it would stop someone with a microbiological background from isolating many of the select agents from nature.","Morse, Stephen A.",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2014.00083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25610829/,251
621313,Brain training using cognitive apps can improve cognitive performance and processing speed in older adults,2021-06-10,"The serum concentration of haptoglobin (S-Hp) was measured in 833 group-housed dairy calves from nine herds in south-west Sweden once at 24–56 days of age to evaluate the potential of S-Hp as an indicator of clinical respiratory-tract disease (CRD). Presence of disease (treated and non-treated) was assessed clinically by farmers and by a project veterinarian visiting the farms every third week. The median S-Hp of healthy calves was 0.06 g/L (80% central range: 0.04–0.23), of calves with diarrhoea within the 10 days before sampling 0.07 g/L (80% central range: 0.04–0.63), and of calves with CRD within the 14 days before sampling 0.09 g/L (80% central range: 0.04–0.69). Eight different cut-off values were used to define a positive S-Hp analysis result: >0.05, >0.06, >0.07, >0.08, >0.09, >0.10, >0.15 and >0.20 g/L. A rectal temperature >39.5 °C was denoted as fever. A positive result of five different diagnostic tests for CRD was defined as: (1) a positive S-Hp with fever absent, (2) a positive S-Hp with fever present, (3) either a positive S-Hp or fever, (4) both a positive S-Hp and fever, and (5) fever (regardless of S-Hp). The sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of each test were calculated from regression coefficients of generalized linear mixed models of the binary test results, applying a logit link. Apart from CRD status (within the 14 days before sampling; no or yes), the models included sex (bull or heifer), and for the test based on S-Hp alone, also rectal temperature (fever, no or yes). Confidence intervals (CI) of Se and Sp were estimated by simulation. Based on Se, Sp, and areas under Receiver Operating Characteristics curves, test 3 was considered the best. At optimal performance, giving equal importance to type I and II errors, i.e. at a S-Hp cut-off of 0.15 g/L in heifer calves, Se was 0.64 (95% CI 0.50–0.77) and Sp 0.71 (95% CI 0.60–0.80), and at a S-Hp cut-off of 0.08 g/L in bulls, Se was 0.52 (95% CI 0.40–0.64) and Sp 0.80 (95% CI 0.74–0.85). The other tests were judged as unsatisfactory indicators of CRD. In heifers, the proportion of CRD-positive calves in the herd was strongly associated with the proportion of test positives (S-Hp or fever; S-HP and fever), suggesting potential as a herd-level indicator.","Svensson, C.; Liberg, P.; Hultgren, J.",Vet J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16949317/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023306001559; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023306001559,251

623765,Management of COVID-19: Current Status and Future Prospects,2021-04-17,"The Anthropocene is marked by twin crises: climate change and biodiversity loss. Climate change has tended to dominate the headlines, reflecting, in part, the greater complexity of the biodiversity crisis. Biodiversity itself is a difficult concept. Land plants dominate the global biomass and terrestrial arthropods probably dominate in terms of numbers of species, but most of the Tree of Life consists of single-celled eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea. Wild plants provide a huge variety of products and services to people, ranging from those that are species-specific, such as food, medicine, and genetic resources, to many which are partly interchangeable, such as timber and forage for domestic animals, and others which depend on the whole community, but not on individual species, such as regulation of water supply and carbon sequestration. The use of information from remote sensing has encouraged a simplified view of the values of nature’s contributions to people, but this does not match the way most people value nature. We can currently estimate the proportion of species threatened by human impacts only for a few well-assessed groups, for which it ranges from 14% (birds) to 63% (cycads). Less than 8% of land plants have been assessed, but it has been estimated that 30-44% are threatened, although there are still few (0.2%) well-documented extinctions. Priorities for improving protection of biodiversity include: improving the inventory, with surveys focused on geographical areas and taxonomic groups which are under-collected; expanding the protected area system and its representativeness; controlling overexploitation; managing invasive species; conserving threatened species ex situ; restoring degraded ecosystems; and controlling climate change. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) COP15 and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP26 meetings, both postponed to 2021, will provide an opportunity to address both crises, but success will require high ambition from all participants.","Corlett, Richard T.",Plant Divers,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837768/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468265920300354; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pld.2020.04.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468265920300354?v=s5,251
623935,COVID‐19 and the emergency presentation of colorectal cancer,2021-04-24,"OBJECTIVE: We aim to provide early evidence of mental distress and its associated predictors among adults one month into the COVID-19 crisis in Brazil. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of 638 adults in Brazil on March 25–28, 2020, about one month (32 days) cross-sectionally after the first COVID-19 case in South America was confirmed in São Paulo. The 638 adults were in 25 states out of the 26 Brazilian states, with the only exception being Roraima, the least populated state in the Amazon. Of all the participating adults, 24%, 20%, and 18% of them were located in Rio de Janeiro state, Santa Catarina state, and São Paulo state respectively. RESULTS: In Brazil, 52% (332) of the sampled adults experienced mild or moderate distress, and 18.8% (120) suffered severe distress. Adults who were female, younger, more educated, and exercised less reported higher levels of distress. Each individual's distance from the Brazilian epicenter of São Paulo interacted with age and workplace attendance to predict the level of distress. The “typhoon eye effect” was stronger for people who were older or attended their workplace less. The most vulnerable adults were those who were far from the epicenter and did not go to their workplace in the week before the survey. CONCLUSION: Identifying the predictors of distress enables mental health services to better target finding and helping the more mentally vulnerable adults during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.","Zhang, Stephen Xu; Wang, Yifei; Jahanshahi, Asghar Afshar; Li, Jizhen; Schmitt, Valentina Gomes Haensel",J Psychosom Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110366; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022399921000118; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399921000118?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33494004/,251

High-quality evidence on interventions targeting older patients is lacking. Theory is rarely used to tailor adherence solutions. This study aimed to pilot test a novel intervention, developed using the Theoretical Domains Framework, which guides community pharmacists in identifying adherence barriers and delivering tailored solutions (behaviour change techniques). Key study procedures (e.g. recruitment, data collection) for a future randomised controlled trial (cRCT) were also assessed. METHODS: Using purposive sampling, this non-randomised pilot study aimed to recruit 12 community pharmacies (six in Northern Ireland; six in London, England). Pharmacists were trained to deliver the intervention to non-adherent older patients (maximum 10 per pharmacy; target n = 60-120) aged ≥ 65 years (reduced to 50 years due to recruitment challenges) and prescribed ≥ 4 regular medicines. The intervention, guided by an iPad web-application, was delivered over 3-4 face-to-face or telephone sessions, tailored to specific barriers to adherence. We assessed the feasibility of collecting adherence data (primary outcome: self-report and dispensing records), health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and unplanned hospitalisations (secondary outcomes) at baseline and 6-months. The final decision on progressing to a cRCT, using pre-defined ‘stop-amend-go’ criteria, is presented. RESULTS: Fifteen pharmacists from 12 pharmacies were recruited and trained. One pharmacy subsequently dropped out. Sixty patients were recruited (meeting the ‘Amend’ progression criteria), with 56 receiving the intervention. Adherence barriers were identified for 55 patients (98%) and a wide range of behaviour change solutions delivered (median: 5 per patient). Self-report and dispensing adherence data were available for 37 (61.7%) and 44 (73.3%) patients, respectively. HRQOL data were available for 35 (58.3%) patients. GP-reported and self-reported hospitalisations data were available for 47 (78.3%) and 23 (38.3%) patients, respectively. All progression concepts were met (nine ‘Go’ and three ‘Amend’ criteria). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of key study procedures (e.g. pharmacy recruitment) and delivery of a tailored adherence intervention in community pharmacies. However, modifications are required to enhance issues identified with patient recruitment, retention and missing data. A future definitive cRCT will explore the effectiveness of the intervention.

It assesses the conditions at which solar Photovoltaics (PV) and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) would be competitive with a grid (mainly fossil) driven desalination plant for the reference year and by 2030. The paper considers also a scenario where battery storage complements PV power generation. To conduct the analysis, a simple model of water cost calculation is built. Second, the cost related to energy consumption is calculated for different power supply options to evaluate the impact of energy provision cost on the final cost of water. The first main result of this paper is that desalinated water can be obtained at an acceptable cost of around 1 $/m(3). The second one is that PV without storage remains the cheapest power supply option today and by 2030. Storage based solution appears less competitive today but can be more attractive in a framework of increasing electricity grid prices and higher flexibility requirements in the future.

Conventional mechanical ventilation strategies using high levels of PEEP may not be beneficial and can even be harmful to patient with ARDS from COVID-19. So the ventilation strategies should be adjusted in order to improve the pulmonary ventilation function and oxygenation status, and outcomes of the patient. PATIENT CONCERNS: Herein, we present a 76-year-old male patient with ARDS secondary to COVID-19. We describe our experience with mechanical ventilation strategy and the changes in respiratory mechanics in the patient during treatment. DIAGNOSIS: The patient had tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) in nucleic acid test. Chest CT showed multiple ground glass shadows in both lungs. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume and low PEEP. OUTCOMES: After treatment, the patients condition, as well as oxygenation status was improved, and he tested negative for the coronavirus several times.

However, as for any virus, SARS-CoV-2 is subject to constant neutral drift and selection pressure, with new M(pro) mutations arising over time. Identification and structural characterization of M(pro) variants is thus critical for robust inhibitor design. Here we report sequence analysis, structure predictions, and molecular modeling for seventy-nine M(pro) variants, constituting all clinically observed mutations in this protein as of April 29, 2020. Residue substitution is widely distributed, with some tendency toward larger and more hydrophobic residues. Modeling and protein structure network analysis suggest differences in cohesion and active site flexibility, revealing patterns in viral evolution that have relevance for drug discovery.","Cross, Thomas J.; Takahashi, Gemma R.; Diessner, Elizabeth M.; Crosby, Marquise G.; Farahmand, Vesta; Zhuang, Shannon; Butts, Carter T.; Martin, Rachel W.",Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.0c00462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32931703/,251

A total of 622 individuals were screened for SARS-CoV-2 from January to September 2020. Chi-square and logistic regression were used to identify the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and SARS-CoV-2. Of the 622 tested, 14.3% tested positive. The infection rate was the same for both genders (14.3%). Individuals ≥40 years old, from non-urbanized areas, and healthcare professionals had a higher frequency of infection. The risk of infection was very high in individuals ≥60 years old (AOR: 23.3, 95% CI: 4.83–112), in women (AOR: 1.24, 95% CI: 0.76–2.04), in Luanda (AOR: 7.40, 95% CI: 1.64–33.4), and healthcare professionals (AOR: 1.27, 95% CI: 0.60–2.71), whereas a low risk was observed in individuals from urbanized areas (AOR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.26–0.75). Our results suggest that Angolan authorities should implement a greater effort in non-urbanized areas and among healthcare professionals since when these individuals presented any indication for a COVID-19 test, such as fever/cough/myalgia, they were more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than having some other cause for symptoms.","Sebastião, Cruz S.; Neto, Zoraima; Martinez, Pedro; Jandondo, Domingos; Antonio, Janete; Galangue, Manuela; de Carvalho, Marcia; David, Kumbelembe; Miranda, Julio; Afonso, Pedro; Inglês, Luzia; Carrelero, Raisa Rivas; de Vasconcelos, Jocelyne Neto; Morais, Joana",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33765102/,251

We describe here the case of an 82-year-old woman, who came to our attention for a clinical condition consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. Even if initially highly suggestive for a thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), the elevated ADAMTS13 activity together with the alteration of the main coagulation parameters (D-dimer elevation, fibrinogen consumption, slightly prolonged prothrombin time), induced us to consider several other diseases in the differential diagnostic process. The case evolved toward a suspected overlapped secondary hemophagocytic syndrome, though the hyperferritinemia was finally interpreted within the frame of a cytokine storm. After a complex diagnostic workup, the clinical and biochemical parameters guided us toward the diagnosis of a cancer-related microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (CR-MAHA) secondary to a relapsing breast cancer with multiple metastatic localizations. Prednisone 1 mg/kg body weight was started, and several units of fresh frozen plasma were infused, obtaining a good control of the hemolysis.

However, almost all these studies were conducted in high-income countries. The overall aim of the present study was to explore the effect of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s (UNODC) Treatnet Family (TF) in reducing substance consumption, drug-related activities, reducing mental health problems, and in improving family interaction among adolescents with substance-use problems. METHOD: Nineteen adolescents who had been referred to a community counselling clinic because of substance-use problems and their parents/family members participated in TF. They completed a set of questionnaires to measure substance use, family functioning, mental health problems, and life events at pre-, post-intervention as well as at a one month-follow-up assessment. RESULTS: TF had a positive significant impact in reducing alcohol use among adolescents with substance-use problems. The number of adolescents who smoked cigarettes and marijuana, and used amphetamines reduced across time. After participating in TF, the adolescents were involved with significantly fewer friends who consumed substances and participated in antisocial behaviours. Furthermore, parent/family member reported a significant decrease in mental health problems, and positive changes in adolescent’s behaviours.

Implications for interindividual variability in prothrombotic, inflammatory conditions such as COVID-19",2020-10-01,"PURPOSE: The role of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), or other antihypertensive agents in the case of Covid-19 remains controversial. We aimed to investigate the association between antihypertensive agent exposure and in-hospital mortality in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicenter cohort study on patients hospitalized between February 1 and May 15, 2020. All patients had been followed up for at least 30 days. RESULTS: Of the 8078 hospitalized patients for Covid-19, 3686 (45.6%) had hypertension and were included in the study. In this population, the median age was 75.4 (IQR, 21.5) years and 57.1% were male. Overall in-hospital 30-day mortality was 23.1%. The main antihypertensive pharmacological classes used were calcium channel blockers (CCB) (n=1624, 44.1%), beta-blockers (n=1389, 37.7%), ARB (n=1154, 31.3%), and ACEi (n=998, 27.1%). The risk of mortality was lower in CCB (aOR, 0.83 [0.70–0.99]) and beta-blockers (aOR, 0.80 [0.67–0.95]) users and non-significant in ARB (aOR, 0.88 [0.72–1.06]) and ACEi (aOR, 0.83 [0.68–1.02]) users, compared to non-users. These results remain consistent for patients receiving CCB, beta-blocker, or ARB as monotherapies. CONCLUSION: This large multicenter retrospective of Covid-19 patients with hypertension found a reduced mortality among CCB and beta-blockers users, suggesting a putative protective effect. Our findings did not show any association between the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and the risk of in-hospital death. Although they need to be confirmed in further studies, these results support the continuation of antihypertensive agents in patients with Covid-19, in line with the current guidelines.

626959,Review of the measles epidemic in children from Central Eastern Europe in the third millennium,2021-06-02,"BACKGROUND: Self-help smartphone apps offer a new opportunity to address youth suicide prevention by improving access to support and by providing potentially high fidelity and cost-effective treatment. However, there have been very few smartphone apps providing evidence-based support for suicide prevention in this population. To address this gap, we developed the LifeBuoy app, a self-help smartphone app informed by dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to help young people manage suicidal thoughts in their daily life. OBJECTIVE: This study describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the LifeBuoy app for reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviors, depression, anxiety, and psychological distress, and improving general mental well-being in young adults aged 18 to 25 years. METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial recruiting 378 young adults aged between 18 and 25 years and comparing the LifeBuoy app with a matched attention control (a placebo app with the same display but no DBT components). The primary outcome is suicidal thoughts measured by the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS). The secondary outcomes are suicidal behavior, depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and general mental well-being. The changes in the levels of insomnia, rumination, suicide cognitions, distress tolerance, loneliness, and help seeking before and after using the app are evaluated in this study. The study also addresses risk factors and responses to the intervention. A series of items assessing COVID-19 experiences is included in the trial to capture the potential impact of the pandemic on this study. Assessments will occur on the following three occasions: baseline, postintervention, and follow-up at 3 months postintervention. A qualitative interview about user experience with the LifeBuoy app will take place within 4 weeks of the final assessment. Using linear mixed models, the primary analysis will compare the changes in suicidal thoughts in the intervention condition relative to the control condition. To minimize risks, participants will receive a call from the team clinical psychologist by clicking a help button in the app or responding to an automated email sent by the system when they are assessed with elevated suicide risks at the baseline, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up surveys. RESULTS: The trial recruitment started in May 2020. Data collection is currently ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first trial examining the efficacy of a DBT-informed smartphone app delivered to community-living young adults reporting suicidal thoughts. This trial will extend knowledge about the efficacy and acceptability of app-based support for suicidal thoughts in young people.

628628,Indirect Mitral Annuloplasty Using the Carillon Device,2020-11-20,"Facial expressions, and the ability to recognize these expressions, have evolved in humans to communicate information to one another. Face masks are equipment used in healthcare by health professionals to prevent the transmission of airborne infections. As part of the social distancing efforts related to COVID-19, wearing facial masks has been practiced globally. Such practice might influence affective information communication among humans. Previous research suggests that masks disrupt expression recognition of some emotions (e.g., fear, sadness or neutrality) and lower the confidence in their identification. To extend the previous research, in the current study we tested a larger and more diverse sample of individuals and also investigated the effect of masks on perceived intensity of expressions. Moreover, for the first time in the literature we examined these questions using individuals with autistic traits. Specifically, across three experiments using different populations (college students and general population), and the 10-item Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ-10; lower and higher scorers), we tested the effect of facial masks on facial emotion recognition of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutrality. Results showed that the ability to identify all facial expressions decreased when faces were masked, a finding observed across all three studies, contradicting previous research on fear, sad, and neutral expressions. Participants were also less confident in their judgements for all emotions, supporting previous research; and participants perceived emotions as less expressive in the mask condition compared to the unmasked condition, a finding novel to the literature. An additional novel finding was that participants with higher scores on the AQ-10 were less accurate and less confident overall in facial expression recognition, as well as perceiving expressions as less intense. Our findings reveal that wearing face masks decreases facial expression recognition, confidence in expression identification, as well as the perception of intensity for all expressions, affecting high-scoring AQ-10 individuals more than low-scoring individuals.","Pazhoohi, Farid; Forby, Leilani; Kingstone, Alan",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34591895/,251

However, no data are available on the use of LUS in children with COVID-19 pneumonia. In this report, we describe LUS features of 10 consecutively admitted children with COVID-19 in two tertiary-level pediatric hospitals in Rome. LUS revealed signs of lung involvement during COVID-19 infection. In particular, vertical artifacts (70%), pleural irregularities (60%), areas of white lung (10%) and subpleural consolidations (10%) were the main findings in patients with COVID-19. No cases of pleural effusions were found. According to our experience, the routine use of LUS in the evaluation of children with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, when performed by clinicians with documented experience in LUS, was useful in diagnosing and monitoring pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia, reducing unnecessary radiation/sedation in children and exposure of health care workers to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).","Musolino, Anna Maria; Supino, Maria Chiara; Buonsenso, Danilo; Ferro, Valentina; Valentini, Piero; Magistrelli, Andrea; Lombardi, Mary Haywood; Romani, Lorenza; D'Argenio, Patrizia; Campana, Andrea",Ultrasound Med Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301562920301988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409232/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301562920301988?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2020.04.026,251

Although a variety of hypotheses about the hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been proposed, an exact conclusion has not yet been reached. Initial clinical manifestations associated with COVID-19 are similar to those of other acute respiratory infections, leading to misdiagnoses and resulting in the outbreak at the early stage. SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly spread by droplet transmission and close contact; the possibilities of fecal–oral, vertical, and aerosol transmission have not yet been fully confirmed or rejected. Besides, COVID-19 cases have been reported within communities, households, and nosocomial settings through contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients or asymptomatic individuals. Environmental contamination is also a major driver for the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the absence of specific treatment for COVID-19, it is urgent to decrease the risk of transmission and take preventive measures to control the spread of the virus.

630867,Promoting pediatric radiology at multiple levels,2021-05-01,"Technology is giving rise to artificial erotic agents, which we call erobots (erôs + bot). Erobots, such as virtual or augmented partners, erotic chatbots, and sex robots, increasingly expose humans to the possibility of intimacy and sexuality with artificial agents. Their advent has sparked academic and public debates: some denounce their risks (e.g., promotion of harmful sociosexual norms), while others defend their potential benefits (e.g., health, education, and research applications). Yet, the scientific study of human–machine erotic interaction is limited; no comprehensive theoretical models have been proposed and the empirical literature remains scarce. The current research programs investigating erotic technologies tend to focus on the risks and benefits of erobots, rather than providing solutions to resolve the former and enhance the latter. Moreover, we feel that these programs underestimate how humans and machines unpredictably interact and co-evolve, as well as the influence of sociocultural processes on technological development and meaning attribution. To comprehensively explore human–machine erotic interaction and co-evolution, we argue that we need a new unified transdisciplinary field of research—grounded in sexuality and technology positive frameworks—focusing on human-erobot interaction and co-evolution as well as guiding the development of beneficial erotic machines. We call this field Erobotics. As a first contribution to this new discipline, this article defines Erobotics and its related concepts; proposes a model of human-erobot interaction and co-evolution; and suggests a path to design beneficial erotic machines that could mitigate risks and enhance human well-being.","Dubé, Simon; Anctil, Dave",Int J Soc Robot,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12369-020-00706-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33133302/,251

The evidence to date supports an important effect of DPP4 in catalytic cleavage of incretin peptides and this perhaps represents the main mechanism by which DPP4 inhibition improves glycemic control. DPP4 also plays an important role in the degradation of multiple chemokines of which stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1, also known as CXCL12) is perhaps an increasingly recognized target, given its importance in processes, such as hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, and stem cell homing.

631247,Introduction: Women in Medicine.,2021-09-01,"While porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infects and replicates in enterocytes lining villi of neonatal piglets with high efficiency, naturally isolated variants typically grow poorly in established cell lines, unless adapted by multiple passages. Cells infected with most cell-adapted PEDVs usually displayed large syncytia, a process triggered by the spike protein (S). To identify amino acids responsible for S-mediated syncytium formation, we constructed and characterized chimeric S proteins of the cell-adapted variant, YN144, in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) and S1/S2 cleavage site were replaced with those of a poorly culturable field isolate (G2). We demonstrated that the RBD, not the S1/S2 cleavage site, is critical for syncytium formation mediated by chimeric S proteins. Further mutational analyses revealed that a single mutation at the amino acid residue position 672 (V672F) could enable the chimeric S with the entire RBD derived from the G2 strain to trigger large syncytia. Moreover, recombinant PEDV viruses bearing S of the G2 strain with the single V672F substitution could induce extensive syncytium formation and replicate efficiently in VeroE6 cells stably expressing porcine aminopeptidase N (VeroE6-APN). Interestingly, we also demonstrated that while the V672F mutation is critical for the syncytium formation in VeroE6-APN cells, it exerts a minimal effect in Huh-7 cells, thereby suggesting the difference in receptor preference of PEDV among host cells.","Wanitchang, Asawin; Saenboonrueng, Janya; Kaewborisuth, Challika; Srisutthisamphan, Kanjana; Jongkaewwattana, Anan",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30897856/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11030282,251

This report addresses methods and strategies identified by workshop participants for replacement of animals used for potency testing of human vaccines. Vaccines considered to have the highest priority for future efforts were (1) vaccines for which antigen quantification methods are already developed but not validated, (2) vaccines/components that require the largest number of animals, (3) vaccines that require an in vivo challenge test, and (4) vaccines with in vivo tests that are highly variable and cause a significant number of invalid tests. Vaccine potency tests identified as the highest priorities for replacement were those for diphtheria and tetanus, pertussis (whole cell and acellular), rabies, anthrax, polio vaccine (inactivated) and complex combination vaccines based on DT or DTwP/aP. Research into understanding the precise mechanism of protection afforded by vaccines and the identification of clinically relevant immunological markers are needed to facilitate the successful implementation of in vitro testing alternatives.

633357,Compliance with evidence-based clinical guidelines in the management of acute biliary pancreatitis: the MANCTRA-1 study protocol,2021-06-17,"Abstract Objective: In mass crisis setting such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of patients requiring invasive ventilation may exceed the number of available ventilators. This challenge led to the concept of splitting ventilator between several patients, which aroused interest as well as a strong opposition from multiple professional societies (The joint statement)1.Establishment of a safe ventilator splitting setup which enables monitoring and control of each ventilated patient would be a desirable ability. Achieving independency between the Co-vent patients would enable effective coping with different individual clinical scenarios and broaden the pairing possibilities of patients connected to a single ventilator. We conducted an experiment to determine if our designed setup achieves these goals. Methods: We utilized a double two limbed modified ventilator circuits which were connected to dual lung simulators. Adding readily available pressure sensors (transducers), PEEP valves, flow control valves, one-way (check) valves and HME filters made the circuit safe enough and suitable for our goals. We first examined a single lung simulator establishing the baseline set parameters, while monitoring ventilator measures as Tidal Volume. The initial ventilator setting we chose was a controlled mandatory ventilation mode with a PIP (peak inspiratory pressure) of 25cmH2O, PEEP (Positive End Expiratory Pressure) of 5 cmH2O. In pressure control set at 20 cmH2O, the recorded mean TV( tidal volume) was 1000 mL (approximately 500 mL/lung simulator) with an average MV(minute ventilation) of 13 L/min (or 6.5 L/min/lung simulator). After examining the system with the dual modified circuits attached, and obtaining all the ventilation parameters, we simulated several clinical scenarios. We simulated clinical events such as: partial or full obstruction, disconnection, air leak and compliance differentials, which occur frequently on a ventilation course. Thus, it is a paramount system demand to keep undisturbed ventilation to the Co-vent patient A, while being challenged by patient B. Results: The adaptive split ventilator setup yields increased safety, monitoring, and controls ventilation parameters successfully for each connected simulated patient (using lung simulators).It also enables coping with several common clinical scenarios on a ventilation course, by allowing the care provider to control PIP and PEEP of each Co-Vent patient. Conclusion: In a mass crisis setting, when there is a shortage of ventilators supply, and as a last resort, this setup can be a viable option to act upon. This experiment demonstrates the ability of the split ventilator to ventilate dual lung simulators with increased safety, monitoring and ventilation pressures control of each simulated patient. This split ventilator kept supporting a simulated patient with undisturbed parameters while the CO-vent patient was simulated to be disconnected, having an air leak, or exhibiting lung compliance deterioration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a split ventilator setup demonstrates these capabilities. Our pilot experiment suggests a significant potential of expanding the ventilator support resources, and is especially relevant during COVID-19 outbreak. Since this setup has not been used in a clinical setting yet, further research should be conducted to explore the safety limits and the capabilities of this model.","Shahroor, S.

Cardiological clinics are facing constrained resources, limiting timely treatment of patients as usual. Patients with valvular heart disease are one of the most time sensitive patient populations, with delayed therapy possible leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Identifying and allocating the available resources to the most vulnerable patients is crucial in providing optimal patient care with prioritization of essential surgical or percutaneous procedures for valvular heart disease.

When the entrepreneurial activity is undertaken among especially vulnerable groups in the labor market, the multiplying effect of this value is made explicit in society, in general, and in the collective of people with disabilities (PWDs), in particular. The objective of this research study is to explore under which conditions this happens through the analysis not only of the relationship between the competencies that PWDs attribute to themselves and their development of the entrepreneurial activity but also of that between entrepreneurship and certain conditions that potentially create value by increasing the autonomy among this collective. A quantitative methodology based on the analysis of the survey carried out on a sample of 224 entrepreneurs with physical, sensory, or organic disabilities throughout Spain has been used. According to the results, entrepreneurs with disabilities (EWDs) have a higher self-evaluation competency. Furthermore, significant results concerning the link between the form of autonomous cohabitation of this collective and entrepreneurship have been obtained.","Ortiz García, Pilar; Olaz Capitán, Ángel José",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305761/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.699833,251

Although the world has intensively focused on the epidemic center during this period of time, it is imperative to emphasize that more attention should also be paid to some impoverished areas in China since they are more vulnerable to disease outbreak due to their weak health service capacities. Therefore, this study took Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture as an example to analyze the COVID-19 epidemic in the impoverished area, evaluate the control effect and explore future control strategies. METHODS: In this study, we collected information including age, gender, nationality, occupation, and address of all COVID-19 cases reported from 25 January 2020 to 23 April 2020 in Liangshan Prefecture from the Nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System (NIDRIS), which were used under license and not publicly available. Additionally, we retrieved other information of cases through epidemiological investigation reports reviewing. Data were analyzed using the software Excel 2010 and SPSS 17.0. The geographic distribution of cases was mapped using ArcGIS10.2. RESULTS: By 23 April 2020, a total of 13 COVID-19 cases and two asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers were reported in Liangshan, in three family clusters. Among the cases, eight cases had a history of sojourning in Hubei Province (61.54%), of which six were related to Wuhan. Cases aged under 44 years accounted for 61.54%, with no child case. The delay of patients’ hospital visiting, and the low degree of cooperation in epidemiological investigation are problems. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, Liangshan was well under control. This was mainly contributed to strict preventive strategies aimed at local culture, inter-sectoral coordination and highly degree of public cooperation. Besides, some possible environmentally and culturally preventive factors (e.g., rapid air flow and family concept) would affect disease prevention and control. In the next step, the health education about COVID-19 should be strengthened and carried out according to the special culture of ethnic minorities to enhance public awareness of timely medical treatment.","Liao, Ru-Jun; Ji-Ke, Chun-Nong; Zhang, Tao; Liao, Qiang; Li, Ling; Zhu, Tian-Yu; Bian, Shao-Yong",Infect Dis Poverty,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32787916/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00706-2,251

COMP encodes the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, which is expressed predominantly in the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding the cells that make up cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. Mutations in COMP are known to give rise to PSACH. In this study, we identified a novel nucleotide mutation (NM_000095.2: c.1317C>G, p.D439E) in COMP responsible for PSACH in a Chinese family by employing whole-exome sequencing (WES) and built the structure model of the mutant protein to clarify its pathogenicity.

Airway management has been particularly difficult; the challenge of quickly establishing an airway in patients must be balanced by the risk of aerosolizing respiratory secretions and putting the provider at risk of infection. Significant attention has been given to developing protocols for the emergency department and critical care units, but little guidance regarding establishing airway and respiratory support for patients in the prehospital setting has been made available. While some of the recommendations can be extrapolated from hospital guidelines, other factors such as environment and available resources make these protocols unfeasible. Through review of current literature the authors established recommendations regarding airway management and the provision of respiratory support to patients developing respiratory failure related to COVID-19.","Hart, James; Tracy, Rebecca; Johnston, Matthew; Brown, Sara; Stephenson, Connor; Kegg, Jason; Waymack, James",West J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.5.47540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726247/,251

DNA, fingerprints, and dental data are considered primary identifiers and are usually collected during any human identification process. Post-mortem dental data should be collected and analyzed by forensic odontologists, as a dental autopsy must not be confused with a dental examination. The virdentopsy project was inaugurated in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, to allow the correct process of human remains by collecting dental data from teeth and jaws, which was then transmitted to forensic odontologists remotely for an expert opinion to achieve a generic profile of the unidentified human remains. The post-mortem dental biography is paramount to narrow the search for compatible missing persons but requires knowledge and experience of forensic odontologists. The virdentopsy process uses radiographic imaging (periapical X-rays, CT scans, panoramics), 2D/3D photos and video recording, photogrammetry documentation, 3D scanning, and live streaming where possible. This registered term was created by merging the terms “virtual” and “dental autopsy” but with no commercial benefits. The proposed process combines research topics under the field of the human rights of the dead and humanitarian forensic odontology services. It should enhance and accelerate the human identification process of the deceased, age estimation of the living, analysis of panoramic X-ray images, and be an educational tool for remote live training in forensic odontology and anatomy of skulls. This paper presents an overview of the virdentopsy process in the field of forensic odontology as a remote consultation as well as an educational tool for undergraduates and postgraduates.","Nuzzolese, Emilio",Dent J (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/dj9090102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34562976/,251

639036,Mast Cells: Therapeutic Targets For COVID-19 And Beyond.,2021-08-31,"Medical malpractice occurs when a hospital, doctor, or other health care professional, through a negligent act or omission, causes an injury to a patient. The negligence might be the result of errors in diagnosis, treatment, aftercare, or health management. To be considered medical malpractice under the law, the claim must violate the standard of care, the injury must be caused by the negligence and, last but most certainly not least, the injury must result in significant damages. This review is an overview of medicolegal issues specific to the practice of Dermatopathology with the caveat that most are likely pertinent to other specialties of pathology as well. The safety of patients remains the priority in pathology as it does in any medical undertaking, and this is no different in the practice of Dermatopathology. The review is broadly divided in 2 parts-we begin with an overview of tort reforms, advocated by physicians to reduce costs associated with malpractice defense. In the second part we address practical issues specific to the practice of pathology and dermatopathology. These include among others, errors-related to the biopsy type, inadequacy of clinical information regarding the lesion that is biopsied, role of interstate dermatopathology as well as examples of select entities commonly misdiagnosed in dermatopathology. In the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has moved to the forefront of technology. While research into the uses of AI in pathology is promising, the use of AI in diagnostic practice is still somewhat uncommon. Given that AI is not fully integrated routinely as a diagnostic adjunct, its' impact on pathology-specific medicolegal issues cannot, as yet at least, be defined. Restriction of medical malpractice is of particular relevance in the COVID-19 era, a period that is anything but normal. The response of states with specific pandemic-related guidelines is addressed with the caveat that this particular issue is only covered in select states. Furthermore, given that the COVID pandemic is only a year old, while it does not appear to have had an immediate impact on pathology-specific medicolegal matters, it is possible that the role of COVID on this issue, if any at all, will and can only be fully defined a few years down the line.","Mahalingam, Meera",Adv. anat. pathol,https://doi.org/10.1097/pap.0000000000000319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34561375/,251
640057,B-Cell Engineering: A promising approach towards vaccine development for COVID-19,2020-06-02,"The use of face masks by the general population during viral outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, although at times controversial, has been effective in slowing down the spread of the virus. The extent to which face masks mitigate the transmission is highly dependent on how well the mask fits each individual. The fit of simple cloth masks on the face, as well as the resulting perimeter leakage and face mask efficacy, are expected to be highly dependent on the type of mask and facial topology. However, this effect has, to date, not been adequately examined and quantified. Here, we propose a framework to study the efficacy of different mask designs based on a quasi-static mechanical model of the deployment of face masks onto a wide range of faces. To illustrate the capabilities of the proposed framework, we explore a simple rectangular cloth mask on a large virtual population of subjects generated from a 3D morphable face model. The effect of weight, age, gender, and height on the mask fit is studied. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended homemade cloth mask design was used as a basis for comparison and was found not to be the most effective design for all subjects. We highlight the importance of designing masks accounting for the widely varying population of faces. Metrics based on aerodynamic principles were used to determine that thin, feminine, and young faces were shown to benefit from mask sizes smaller than that recommended by the CDC. Besides mask size, side-edge tuck-in, or pleating, of the masks as a design parameter was also studied and found to have the potential to cause a larger localized gap opening.","Solano, Tomas; Mittal, Rajat; Shoele, Kourosh",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34133436/,251

Here, we aimed to discuss the correlation between the purinergic system and BC, recognizing therapeutic targets. For this, we analyzed the interaction of extracellular nucleotides and nucleosides with the purinergic receptors P1 and P2, as well as the influence of ectonucleotidase enzymes (CD39 and CD73) on tumor progression. A comprehensive bibliographic search was carried out. The relevant articles for this review were found in the PubMed, Scielo, Lilacs, and ScienceDirect databases. It was observed that among the P1 receptors, the A1, A2A, and A2B receptors are involved in the proliferation and invasion of BC, while the A3 receptor is related to the inhibition of tumor growth. Among the P2 receptors, the P2X7 has a dual function. When activated for a short time, it promotes metastasis, but when activated for long periods, it is related to BC cell death. P2Y2 and P2Y6 receptors are related to BC proliferation and invasiveness. Also, the high expression of CD39 and CD73 in BC is strongly related to a worse prognosis. The receptors and ectonucleotidases involved with BC become possible therapeutic targets. Several purinergic pathways have been found to be involved in BC cell survival and progression. In this review, in addition to analyzing the pathways involved, we reviewed the therapeutic interventions already studied for BC related to the purinergic system, as well as to other possible therapeutic targets.","de Araújo, Julia Beatrice; Kerkhoff, Vanessa Vitória; de Oliveira Maciel, Sarah Franco Vieira; de Resende e Silva, Débora Tavares",Purinergic Signal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33576905/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11302-020-09760-9,251

We draw on data collected from 1,374 American adults between 4 and 8 April 2020, about two weeks after lockdown measures were introduced in various parts of the United States. We first address whether people changed their digital media use to reach out to friends and family, looking into voice calls, video calls, text messaging, social media, and online games. Then, we show how age, gender, living alone, concerns about Internet access, and Internet skills relate to changes in social contact during the pandemic. We discuss how the use of digital media for social connection during a global public health crisis may be unequally distributed among citizens and may continue to shape inequalities even after the pandemic is over.

Data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was assessed to determine the effectiveness of implantable remote monitoring on the improvement of outcomes in HF patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs testing remote monitoring versus standard of care for management of HF patients was performed. Primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and a composite of cardiovascular (CV) and HF hospitalizations. Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. A secondary analysis tested for heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) comparing right ventricular/pulmonary pressure monitoring versus impedance-based monitoring on hospitalization. A regression analysis was performed using the mean follow-up time as the moderator on each primary endpoint. Eleven RCTs (n = 6196) were identified with a mean follow-up of 21.9 months. The mean age and reported ejection fraction were 64.1 years and 27.7%, respectively. Remote monitoring did not reduce mortality (RR 0.89 [95% CI 0.77, 1.03]) or the composite of CV and HF hospitalizations (RR 0.98 [0.81, 1.19]). Subgroup analysis found significant HTE for hospitalizations between those studies that used right ventricular/pulmonary pressure monitoring versus impedance-based monitoring (I(2) = 87.1%, chi(2) = 7.75, p = 0.005). Regression analysis found no relationship between the log rate ratio of remote monitoring’s effect on mortality, CV hospitalization or HF hospitalization, and mean follow-up time.

645012,Mindfulness in Gastroenterology Training and Practice: A Personal Perspective,2020-11-04,"In 2007, a novel coronavirus associated with an acute respiratory disease in alpacas (Alpaca Coronavirus, ACoV) was isolated. Full-length genomic sequencing of the ACoV demonstrated the genome to be consistent with other Alphacoronaviruses. A putative additional open-reading frame was identified between the nucleocapsid gene and 3'UTR. The ACoV was genetically most similar to the common human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E with 92.2% nucleotide identity over the entire genome. A comparison of spike gene sequences from ACoV and from HCoV-229E isolates recovered over a span of five decades showed the ACoV to be most similar to viruses isolated in the 1960’s to early 1980’s. The true origin of the ACoV is unknown, however a common ancestor between the ACoV and HCoV-229E appears to have existed prior to the 1960’s, suggesting virus transmission, either as a zoonosis or anthroponosis, has occurred between alpacas and humans.","Crossley, Beate M.; Mock, Richard E.; Callison, Scott A.; Hietala, Sharon K.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23235471/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v4123689,251

Sequence analysis of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome predicts several proteins that are unique to SARS-CoV. The search to understand the high virulence of SARS-CoV compared with related coronaviruses, which cause lesser respiratory illnesses, has recently focused on the unique nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV and suggests evolution of a possible new virulence mechanism in coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV nsp1 protein increases cellular RNA degradation and thus might facilitate SARS-CoV replication or block immune responses.","Connor, Ramsey F.; Roper, Rachel L.",Trends Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X06002794; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966842X06002794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17207625/,251

645995,Using online technologies to improve diversity and inclusion in cognitive interviews with young people,2020-06-16,"BACKGROUND: In India, the SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 epidemic has grown to 1251 cases and 32 deaths as on 30 Mar 2020. The healthcare impact of the epidemic in India was studied using a stochastic mathematical model. METHODS: A compartmental SEIR model was developed, in which the flow of individuals through compartments is modeled using a set of differential equations. Different scenarios were modeled with 1000 runs of Monte Carlo simulation each using MATLAB. Hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) requirements, and deaths were modeled on SimVoi software. The impact of nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) including social distancing and lockdown on checking the epidemic was estimated. RESULTS: Uninterrupted epidemic in India would have resulted in more than 364 million cases and 1.56 million deaths with peak by mid-July. As per the model, at current growth rate of 1.15, India is likely to reach approximately 3 million cases by 25 May, implying 125,455 (±18,034) hospitalizations, 26,130 (±3298) ICU admissions, and 13,447 (±1819) deaths. This would overwhelm India's healthcare system. The model shows that with immediate institution of NPIs, the epidemic might still be checked by mid-April 2020. It would then result in 241,974 (±33,735) total infections, 10,214 (±1649) hospitalizations, 2121 (±334) ICU admissions, and 1081 (±169) deaths. CONCLUSION: At the current growth rate of epidemic, India's healthcare resources will be overwhelmed by the end of May. With the immediate institution of NPIs, total cases, hospitalizations, ICU requirements, and deaths can be reduced by almost 90%.","Chatterjee, Kaustuv; Chatterjee, Kaushik; Kumar, Arun; Shankar, Subramanian",Med J Armed Forces India,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377123720300605; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377123720300605; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.03.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292232/,251
646853,Covid-19 diagnosis by combining RT-PCR and pseudo-convolutional machines to characterize virus sequences,2021-06-02,"Background: COVID-19 rapidly escalated into a pandemic, threatening 213 countries, areas, and territories the world over. We aimed to identify potential province-level socioeconomic determinants of the virus's dissemination, and explain between-province differences in the speed of its spread, based on data from 36 provinces of Northern Italy. Methods: This is an ecological study. We included all confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported between February 24th and March 30th, 2020. For each province, we calculated the trend of contagion as the relative increase in the number of individuals infected between two time endpoints, assuming an exponential growth. Pearson's test was used to correlate the trend of contagion with a set of healthcare-associated, economic, and demographic parameters by province. The virus's spread was input as a dependent variable in a stepwise OLS regression model to test the association between rate of spread and province-level indicators. Findings: Multivariate analysis showed that the spread of COVID-19 was correlated negatively with aging index (p-value=0.003), and positively with public transportation per capita (p-value=0.012), the % of private long-term care hospital beds and, to a lesser extent (p-value=0.070), the % of private acute care hospital beds (p-value=0.006). Interpretation: Demographic and socioeconomic factors, and healthcare organization variables were found associated with a significant difference in the rate of COVID-19 spread in 36 provinces of Northern Italy. An aging population seemed to naturally contain social contacts. The availability of healthcare resources and their coordination could play an important part in spreading infection.","Buja, Alessandra; Paganini, Matteo; Cocchio, Silvia; Scioni, Manuela; Rebba, Vincenzo; Baldo, Vincenzo",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.25.20078311v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.25.20078311,251

The purpose of the study was to investigate mechanical engineering undergraduate students’ performance in the flipped classroom. A comprehensive analysis was conducted to investigate the pedagogical benefits of active learning in the flipped classroom from a self-determination theory perspective. To evaluate the effectiveness of the flipped classroom, students’ academic achievements in the flipped classroom were compared with the ones in the traditional lecture format. Moreover, to explore in-depth students’ learning experiences and their perceptions about the flipped classroom, students’ open-ended surveys were analyzed. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that students in the flipped classroom performed better and favored the new model, feeling that flipped classroom was useful and helpful in preparing for the course. The qualitative findings showed that students felt that they benefited from the pre-week online lectures in the flipped classroom to prepare for the course. CONCLUSIONS: The current study shows that the flipped classroom model has the potential to create an autonomy-supportive learning environment and provide beneficial learning experiences. This study highlights the benefits of and future direction for implementing the flipped classroom in traditional mechanical engineering courses.","Cho, Hyun Jin; Zhao, Kejie; Lee, Cho Rong; Runshe, Debra; Krousgrill, Chuck",Int J STEM Educ,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40594-021-00302-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34312588/,251
647310,"Understanding antibiotic use: practices, structures and networks",2021-10-04,"Higher transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in cold and dry weather conditions has been hypothesized since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic but the level of epidemiological evidence remains low. During the first wave of the pandemic, Spain, Italy, France, Portugal, Canada and USA presented an early spread, a heavy COVID-19 burden, and low initial public health response until lockdowns. In a context when testing was limited, we calculated the basic reproduction number (R(0)) in 63 regions from the growth in regional death counts. After adjusting for population density, early spread of the epidemic, and age structure, temperature and humidity were negatively associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility. A reduction of mean absolute humidity by 1 g/m(3) was associated with a 0.15-unit increase of R(0). Below 10 °C, a temperature reduction of 1 °C was associated with a 0.16-unit increase of R(0). Our results confirm a dependency of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility to weather conditions in the absence of control measures during the first wave. The transition from summer to winter, corresponding to drop in temperature associated with an overall decrease in absolute humidity, likely contributed to the intensification of the second wave in north-west hemisphere countries. Non-pharmaceutical interventions must be adjusted to account for increased transmissibility in winter conditions.","Landier, Jordi; Paireau, Juliette; Rebaudet, Stanislas; Legendre, Eva; Lehot, Laurent; Fontanet, Arnaud; Cauchemez, Simon; Gaudart, Jean",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91798-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140557/,251
647419,Seven decades of chemotherapy clinical trials: a pan-cancer social network analysis,2020-10-16,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: There has been a paucity of vaccine and vaccine-related definitions within the scientific and medical peer-reviewed literature, particularly with the arrival of COVID-19. Therefore, it was the aim of this commentary to collate definitions to 44 vaccine- and vaccinology-related key terms, from four international and respected sources of information (where available), including (i) the World Health Organisation (WHO), (ii) the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), (iii) The Department of Health, Government of Australia and (iv) the European Union. In addition, it was a further aim to develop a lay person's definition to each of these 44 key terms, to act as a published and citeable reference point for pharmacists and other healthcare professionals, when communicating with patients and other public-facing stakeholders. COMMENT: Definitions are important in health care in order to (i) provide concise insight on a specific topic, (ii) provide a common understanding and (iii) set reference points to allow the adoption of a standard uniform approach. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The collation of definitions of key vaccine terms was compiled from four respected sources of information. A glossary of 44 key terms was produced to help pharmacists and other healthcare professionals explain such terms professionally, as well as to patient stakeholders in lay person's vocabulary. These lay definitions had superior readability metrics than definitions from any of the four professional sources, indicating their suitability for engagement with patient-facing stakeholders. Understanding the barriers to vaccine uptake is crucial for health professionals and policymakers to achieve improved uptake rates. This commentary has aimed at adding value to healthcare professionals and patients, by providing an up-to-date glossary of several professional definitions, from respected sources, as well as an accompanying lay definition to support the healthcare professional-patient communicative interface. Vaccines have become an important preventative tool, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, to help mitigate disease severity and to help control the pandemic locally, nationally and internationally. Accessible and robust definitions help inform the dialogue to achieve this goal and the avoidance of obscurum per obscurius.","Brennan, Orlaith C; Moore, John E; Moore, Peter J A; Millar, Beverley C",J. clin. pharm. ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34463972/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpt.13516,251

Evidence suggests the baseline risk for vitamin D (vitD) deficiency is increased among immigrants who move from equatorial to northern countries. We investigated the prevalence and determinants of vitD deficiency/insufficiency among first-generation immigrants compared with native-born Canadians and identified explanatory covariables. We used a cross-sectional design with data from the national Canadian Health Measures Survey (Cycles 3 and 4) (11,579 participants aged 3–79 years). We assessed serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (S-25(OH)D) levels, sociodemographic and environmental factors, immigration status, length of time in Canada, vitD-rich food intake, ethnicity, and place of birth. Immigrants had lower mean S-25(OH)D than non-immigrants (51.23 vs. 62.72 nmol/L, p < 0.001). Those with younger age at the time of immigration (<18 years) had a high risk for low vitD, and S-25(OH)D levels increased with the length of time they had lived in Canada. The highest deficiency levels were in immigrants born in Morocco, India, and Lebanon compared with native-born Canadians. Ethnicity was the factor most strongly associated with S-25(OH)D. Compared with the white ethnic grouping, the Japanese had the highest level of vitD deficiency, followed by Arabs and Southeast Asians. Ethnic variations, dietary intake, and lifestyle factors are the main predictors of/explanatory factors for vitD status among Canadian immigrants.","Yousef, Said; Manuel, Douglas; Colman, Ian; Papadimitropoulos, Manny; Hossain, Alomgir; Faris, MoezAlIslam; Wells, George A.",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444863/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13082702,251

649866,COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system,2020-03-05,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put an enormous burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Limited access to medical care and fear of increased infective risks due to the use of immunosuppressive medication (IM) have increased concerns about IM adherence in kidney transplant recipients (KTR). The aim of this study is to determine the various dimensions of IM non-adherence in KTR during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a single-center, cross-sectional study using a convenient sampling approach. KTR with follow-up in Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong between 1st May 2020 and 30th September 2020 were invited to complete a self-reported questionnaire on IM adherence. The sociodemographic factors associated with IM adherence were extracted from medical record. RESULTS: Total 210 patients completed the questionnaires. The overall IM non-adherence rate was 35.2% in the preceding 4 weeks. None of the patients stopped taking IM without doctors’ instructions. The most common pattern of IM non-adherence was timing adherence (n=63, 30.1%), followed by dose-skipping item. Among the different sociodemographic factors studied, only marital status was an independent risk factor of IM non-adherence (OR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.04-3.72, P=0.03). CONCLUSION: The impact of COVID-19 on IM adherence in KTR was small. All the patients continued their IM despite of the pandemic.

650286,Predictive molecular pathology in the time of COVID-19,2020-05-19,"BACKGROUND: Drug repositioning refers to the identification of new indications for existing drugs. Drug-based inference methods for drug repositioning apply some unique features of drugs for new indication prediction. Complementary information is provided by these different features. It is therefore necessary to integrate these features for more accurate in silico drug repositioning. RESULTS: In this study, we collect 3 different types of drug features (i.e., chemical, genomic and pharmacological spaces) from public databases. Similarities between drugs are separately calculated based on each of the features. We further develop a fusion method to combine the 3 similarity measurements. We test the inference abilities of the 4 similarity datasets in drug repositioning under the guilt-by-association principle. Leave-one-out cross-validations show the integrated similarity measurement IntegratedSim receives the best prediction performance, with the highest AUC value of 0.8451 and the highest AUPR value of 0.2201. Case studies demonstrate IntegratedSim produces the largest numbers of confirmed predictions in most cases. Moreover, we compare our integration method with 3 other similarity-fusion methods using the datasets in our study. Cross-validation results suggest our method improves the prediction accuracy in terms of AUC and AUPR values. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the 3 drug features used in our manuscript are valuable information for drug repositioning. The comparative results indicate that integration of the 3 drug features would improve drug-disease association prediction. Our study provides a strategy for the fusion of different drug features for in silico drug repositioning.","Chen, Hailin; Zhang, Zuping; Zhang, Jingpu",BMC Bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-021-03988-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33557749/,251

The 2020-2021 Strategic Engagement Standing Committee was charged with identifying effective strategies to leverage the temporary expansion of pharmacist practice capabilities granted during the COVID-19 pandemic for sustained practice. The group was also tasked with looking at ways to partner with the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), our medicine counterparts to develop a plan for collaborating with them to advance interprofessional practice. In this unique year, all standing committees were charged with reading all the reports last year to put President Lin's charges into perspective with the hopes of carrying over the overall theme and work of the previous years committee. Overall, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been several expansions on the scope of practice for pharmacists and vary by state.

The underlying aim of the NIH Roadmap is to accelerate the movement of scientific findings into practical health care provisions through translational research. MAIN TEXT: Despite the advances in health sciences, emerging infectious diseases have become more frequent in recent decades. Furthermore, emerging and reemerging pathogens have led to several global public health challenges. A question, and to an extent a concern, arises from this: Why our health care system is experiencing several challenges in encountering the coronavirus outbreak, despite the ever-growing advances in sciences, and the exponential rise in the number of published articles in the first quartile journals and even the ones among the top 1%? CONCLUSION: Two responses could be potentially provided to the above question: First, there seems to be a significant gap between our theoretical knowledge and practice. And second that many scholars and scientists publish papers only to have a longer list of publications, and therefore publishing is viewed as a personal objective, rather than for improving communities’ public health.","Jalali, Rostam; Hosseinian-Far, Amin; Mohammadi, Masoud",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13756-021-00884-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33436062/,251

This initiative contains important health components. Simultaneously, China launched an unprecedented overseas intervention against Ebola virus in west Africa, dispatching 1200 workers, including Chinese military personnel. The overseas development assistance provided by China has been increasing by 25% annually, reaching US$7 billion in 2013. Development assistance for health from China has particularly been used to develop infrastructure and provide medical supplies to Africa and Asia. China's contributions to multilateral organisations are increasing but are unlikely to bridge substantial gaps, if any, vacated by other donors; China is creating its own multilateral funds and banks and challenging the existing global architecture. These new investment vehicles are more aligned with the geography and type of support of the Belt and Road Initiative.

652487,Lack of efficacy of mono-mode of action therapeutics in COVID-19 therapy - How the lack of predictive power of preclinical cell and animal studies leads developments astray,2021,The huge fiscal expansions triggered by the corona crisis raised debt/GDP ratios to very high levels. This led some economists to reconsider the taboo on seignorage. Following a brief documentation of the crisis impact and aggregate demand policies responses the paper discusses views of academics and policymakers on seignorage. Optimal taxation considerations imply that the decision on allocating deficit financing between debt and seignorage falls within the realm of fiscal authorities—a fact that infringes on central bank (CB) autonomy. The paper explores ideas aimed at improving the tradeoff between those two principles. Implication of cross-country variations in the need to use seignorage is discussed. Comparison of the indirect contribution of quantitative easing (QE) to deficit financing with the direct contribution of seignorage implies that QE is a substitute to seignorage that preserves central bank dominance without much change in existing monetary institutions.

Thus, electoral fraud is a major issue. E-governance and e-voting are now being used in many countries, some of which are investigating blockchain solutions. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential contributions of blockchain technology to peace on a worldwide level by securing voting systems. Unfortunately, this technology is complex and could potentially generate conflict between actors in elections. Taking an exploratory approach, the authors chose a qualitative method to address this specific topic. Election observers and blockchain experts were interviewed to identify the technology's strengths and weaknesses. Our results emphasize the importance of trust and human factors in the voting process.","Baudier, Patricia; Kondrateva, Galina; Ammi, Chantal; Seulliet, Eric",Technol Forecast Soc Change,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040162520312233; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071364/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162520312233,251

653365,Day-to-day discovery of preprint–publication links,2021-04-18,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Delta variant quickly rose to dominance in mid-2021, displacing other variants, including Alpha. Studies using data from the United Kingdom and India estimated that Delta was 40-80% more transmissible than Alpha, allowing Delta to become the globally dominant variant. However, it was unclear if the ostensible difference in relative transmissibility was due mostly to innate properties of Delta's infectiousness or differences in the study populations. To investigate, we formed a partnership with SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance programs from all six New England US states. By comparing logistic growth rates, we found that Delta emerged 37-163% faster than Alpha in early 2021 (37% Massachusetts, 75% New Hampshire, 95% Maine, 98% Rhode Island, 151% Connecticut, and 163% Vermont). We next computed variant-specific effective reproductive numbers and estimated that Delta was 58-120% more transmissible than Alpha across New England (58% New Hampshire, 68% Massachusetts, 76% Connecticut, 85% Rhode Island, 98% Maine, and 120% Vermont). Finally, using RT-PCR data, we estimated that Delta infections generate on average ~6 times more viral RNA copies per mL than Alpha infections. Overall, our evidence indicates that Delta's enhanced transmissibility could be attributed to its innate ability to increase infectiousness, but its epidemiological dynamics may vary depending on the underlying immunity and behavior of distinct populations.","Earnest, R.; Uddin, R.; Matluk, N.; Renzette, N.; Siddle, K.

However, much of the current studies published are in the form of case reports or case series which can be prone to biases. Other factors also further complicate attempts to analyze data accurately. Hence, this evaluation hopes to highlight some of these problems and provide suggestions to help clinicians mitigate and make reasonable conclusions when reading the abundant yet limited body of evidence when furthering their research efforts. METHODS: Studies regarding COVID-19 and pregnancy were searched on databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library. Manual search of references of select articles were also undertaken. Apart from summarizing study limitations identified by authors, the characteristics of current literature and systematic reviews were also evaluated to identify potential factors affecting accuracy of subsequent analysis. RESULTS: Factors such as innate biasness in study design of current literature, duplicate reporting, differing inclusion criteria of systematic reviews, scarce data, inadequate follow-up period and limitations of systematic reviews have been shown to hinder the ability for accurate data extrapolation. DISCUSSION: Unless additional studies are conducted in identified areas of data scarcity and a common list of factors affecting accuracy of data analysis are taken into account when developing recommendations, discrepancies will continue to arise and accurate data analysis and valid systematic reviews will be precluded.","Ang, Xue Ling; Chonkar, Sonali Prashant; Chua, Monica Shi Qi; Sulaiman, Suzanna; Lee, Jill Cheng Sim",Matern Child Health J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33222027/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-020-03046-7,251

Individuals with stimulant use disorder are a vulnerable population, who are particularly at risk of negative outcomes during this pandemic due to several risk factors, including mental and physical comorbidities, weakened immune responses, high-risk behaviors, and barriers to healthcare access. Engaging patients with stimulant use disorder in regular treatment has become even more difficult during this pandemic, which has resulted in many cuts to addiction treatment programs. The most effective treatment options for stimulant use disorder are psychosocial interventions, which rely heavily on in-person interactions, which poses an added challenge during physical distancing. In particular, contingency management (CM) is a behavioral therapy that utilizes tangible reinforcements to incentivize targeted behavior changes, and is an effective treatment intervention used for stimulant use disorder. This paper highlights the treatment challenges for individuals with stimulant use disorder and the importance of adapting CM programs during COVID-19. We present strategies for how CM can be adapted and its role expanded in a safe way during the COVID-19 pandemic to help prevent infection spread, stimulant use relapse, and worsened psychosocial consequences.","Zastepa, Evelyn; Sun, Jane C.; Clune, Jennifer; Mathew, Nickie",J Subst Abuse Treat,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0740547220303585; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854983/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740547220303585?v=s5,251

Nanomaterials can be effectively used to detect, capture/inactivate or inhibit coronavirus cell entry/replication in the human host cell, preventing infection. Their potential for nanovaccines, immunoengineering, diagnosis, repurposing medication, and disinfectant surfaces targeting the novel coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) is highlighted. In this systematic review the aim is to present an unbiased view of which and how nanomaterials can reduce the spread of COVID‐19. Herein, the focus is on SARS‐CoV‐2, analyzing 46 articles retrieved before December 31, 2020. The interface between nanomaterials is described, and the main mechanisms to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 pathogenesis and viral inactivation are also discussed. Nanocarbons, biopolymeric, copper, and silver nanoparticles are potential antiviral and virucidal agents toward self‐cleaning and reusable filter media and surfaces (e.g., facial masks), drug administration, vaccines, and immunodiagnostic assays. Trends in toxicology research and safety tests can help fill the main gaps in the literature and overcome health surveillance's challenges. Phytochemicals delivery by nanocarriers also stand out as candidates to target and bio‐friendly therapy. Nanocellulose might fill in the gaps.

655101,Developments in distinguishing secondary vascular headache from Primary headache disorders in clinical practice,2021,"Zoonotic Campylobacter species—mainly C. jejuni and C. coli—are major causes of food-borne bacterial infectious gastroenteritis worldwide. Symptoms of intestinal campylobacteriosis include abdominal pain, diarrhea and fever. The clinical course of enteritis is generally self-limiting, but some infected individuals develop severe post-infectious sequelae including autoimmune disorders affecting the nervous system, the joints and the intestinal tract. Moreover, in immunocompromised individuals, systemic spread of the pathogens may trigger diseases of the circulatory system and septicemia. The socioeconomic costs associated with Campylobacter infections have been calculated to several billion dollars annually. Poultry meat products represent major sources of human infections. Thus, a “One World—One Health” approach with collective efforts of public health authorities, veterinarians, clinicians, researchers and politicians is required to reduce the burden of campylobacteriosis. Innovative intervention regimes for the prevention of Campylobacter contaminations along the food chain include improvements of information distribution to strengthen hygiene measures for agricultural remediation. Given that elimination of Campylobacter from the food production chains is not feasible, novel intervention strategies fortify both the reduction of pathogen contamination in food production and the treatment of the associated diseases in humans. This review summarizes some current trends in the combat of Campylobacter infections including the combination of public health and veterinary preventive approaches with consumer education. The “One World—One Health” perspective is completed by clinical aspects and molecular concepts of human campylobacteriosis offering innovative treatment options supported by novel murine infection models that are based on the essential role of innate immune activation by bacterial endotoxins.","Heimesaat, Markus M.; Backert, Steffen; Alter, Thomas; Bereswill, Stefan",Fighting Campylobacter Infections,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-65481-8_1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33620646/,251
655150,The Access Technology Program of the Indiana Clinical Translational Sciences Institute (CTSI): A model to facilitate access to cutting-edge technologies across a state,2020-08-19,"INTRODUCTION: Historically traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used as treatment during epidemics. During the recent COVID-19 pandemic patients evidence suggests that the use of TCM has provided health benefits and has been successfully used to control the spread of the disease in China. The aim of this study was to systematically explore the TCM formulae which have been used for the prevention and treatment of pneumonia or ‘pestilence’ to investigate their compatibility with the Chinese materia medica (CMM) and understand their potential mechanisms in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Frequency analysis was performed to identify high-frequency CMM and CMM groups. Association rules analysis was applied to investigate the compatibility law of CMMs and generate the commonly used CMM groups. RESULTS: A total of 173 prescriptions were collected. The frequency analysis showed that seven out of ten high-frequency CMMs overlapped with Lianhua Qingwen Capsules (LHQWC), and five high-frequency pair-CMMs and four triple-CMMs were included in LHQWC, respectively. Then three groups of CMM were generated from association rules analysis, one of which is Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSGD). The results of the protein-protein interaction network and enrichment analysis showed that the potential therapeutic mechanisms of the generated prescriptions were involved in the anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and neuroprotective effects. CONCLUSION: This study showed the importance of systematic research on TCM prescriptions and provided candidate CMM groups that have the potential to treat COVID-19. In vitro and in vivo experiments should be conducted to validate these network pharmacology results, which can provide more information for the development of potential antiviral drugs from TCM prescriptions. The combination of TCM treatment and modern medical approaches will benefit patients with COVID-19 and help to overcome the current epidemic.","Sun, Xiuli; Jiang, Jinhe; Wang, Yang; Liu, Shuying",Eur J Integr Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33163124/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876382020314232?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876382020314232; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101242,251
656107,Delay in the diagnosis of breast cancer during coronavirus pandemic,2021-01-20,"INTRODUCTION: Genomic alterations in a viral genome can lead to either better or worse outcome and identifying these mutations is of utmost importance. Here, we correlated protein-level mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus to clinical outcome. METHODS: Mutations in viral sequences from the GISAID virus repository were evaluated by using “hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019” as the reference. Patient outcomes were classified as mild disease, hospitalization and severe disease (death or documented treatment in an intensive-care unit). Chi-square test was applied to examine the association between each mutation and patient outcome. False discovery rate was computed to correct for multiple hypothesis testing and results passing FDR cutoff of 5% were accepted as significant. RESULTS: Mutations were mapped to amino acid changes for 3,733 non-silent mutations. Mutations correlated to mild outcome were located in the ORF8, NSP6, ORF3a, NSP4, and in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N. Mutations associated with inferior outcome were located in the surface (S) glycoprotein, in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, in ORF3a, NSP3, ORF6 and N. Mutations leading to severe outcome with low prevalence were found in the ORF3A and in NSP7 proteins. Four out of 22 of the most significant mutations mapped onto a 10 amino acid long phosphorylated stretch of N indicating that in spite of obvious sampling restrictions the approach can find functionally relevant sites in the viral genome. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that mutations in the viral genes may have a direct correlation to clinical outcome. Our results help to quickly identify SARS-CoV-2 infections harboring mutations related to severe outcome.","Nagy, Ádám; Pongor, Sándor; Győrffy, Balázs",Int J Antimicrob Agents,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33347989/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857920305008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920305008?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106272,251

We also calculated the secondary attack rate for the primary, secondary, and tertiary transmissions. We conclude that symptomatic COVID-19 are primary and secondary contacts rather than tertiary contacts, hence, former to be quarantined.

This raises ethical and practical challenges when designing and conducting clinical trials involving these populations, who are frequently excluded as a result. Despite recent advances in improving informed consent processes, there has been far less attention paid to the enrolment of adults lacking capacity. Exclusion criteria are an important determinant of the external validity of clinical trial results. The exclusion of these populations, and consent-based recruitment biases which arise from the challenges of identifying and involving surrogate decision-makers, leads to trials which are not representative of the clinical population.

However, little is known about the genotypic diversity and epidemiology of HRV among children with SARI. Thus, we investigated the genotypic diversity and epidemiology of HRV in children with SARI in China over a 2-year period. In total 1,003, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children hospitalized with SARI in Shanghai from 2013 to 2015. HRV was screened for by a PCR method targeting the viral 5′ UTR and was genotyped by sequencing of the VP4–VP2 region of the HRV genome. We also screened for 15 other common respiratory viruses to assess the prevalence of co-infection with HRV. The patient demographic and clinical data were reviewed. HRV was detected in 280 (27.9%) of the 1,003 specimens: HRV-A in 140 (14.0%), HRV-B in 21 (2.1%), HRV-C in 56 (5.6%), and HRV-untyped in 63 (6.3%). A phylogenetic analysis identified 77 genotypes (43 HRV-A, 10 HRV-B, and 24 HRV-C), among which A78, A12, A89, B70, C2, C6, and C24 predominated. HRV-A was detected mainly in winter 2013 and autumn 2014, while HRV-C detection peaked in autumn 2013 and 2014. The detection frequency of HRV-A was highest in patients <5 years old. Most HRV co-infections involved adenovirus, human bocavirus, and/or human respiratory syncytial virus. In conclusion, HRV-A and -C predominate in children with SARI in Shanghai. Among the 77 genotypes detected, A78, A12, A89, B70, C2, C6, and C24 were the most frequent.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study in Nanjing, China, students (grades 1-12) from six randomly selected schools self-administered the online survey questionnaire about hours on electronic devices, outdoor activities, frequency and intensity of 17 CVS symptoms during virtual learning period of COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Among 2363 invited students, 2005 (84.8%) completed the survey. Mean (SD) age was 12 (3.0) years, 51% were male, 53% wore glasses, 56% did not know the 20-20-20 rule (take a 20 second break every 20 min of close work and gaze at objects at least 20 feet away) and 6.5% knew but never followed the 20-20-20 rule. Mean (SD) hours/day was 4.6 (3.4) for screen time and 1.2 (1.0) for outdoor activities. Total of 1543 (77.0%) students reported at least one CVS symptom (median = 4) with eye dryness and itching the most common (48%). In multivariable analysis, CVS score 4 or more was independently associated with older age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.05 for per-year increase, p = 0.02), children with myopia not wearing glasses (aOR = 2.12, p = 0.0003), astigmatism (aOR = 1.37, p = 0.04), other ocular diseases (aOR = 1.59, p = 0.005), not complying 20-20-20 rule (aOR = 2.13, p = 0.04), more screen time (aOR = 1.53 for >6 vs. ≤2 hours, p = 0.0001) and less outdoor activities (aOR = 1.37 for ≤0.6 vs. ≥1.9 hours, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19 pandemic, self-reported CVS symptoms occurred in more than three-quarters of students.

Translation efficiency in this expression system was enhanced significantly by employing the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 5'-untranslated region (UTR) which confers cap-independent translation by directing internal initiation of translation. The enhancement was accomplished by fusing open reading frames (ORFs) to the N terminus of the EMCV polyprotein coding region, thus utilizing its highly efficient translation initiation site. Expression vectors were constructed to allow cloning in all three reading frames. As reporter genes, we used the lacZ gene and a number of genes encoding coronavirus structural proteins: among others the genes encoding glycoproteins with N-terminal signal sequences. The signal sequences of these glycoproteins are located internally in the primary translation product. We demonstrated that this did not interfere with translocation and glycosylation and yields biologically active proteins. The usefulness of sequences that direct internal initiation was extended by using EMCV UTR s to express two and three ORFs from polycistronic mRNAs.","Vennema, Harry; Rijnbrand, Rene; Heijnen, Leo; Horzinek, Marian C.; Spaan, Willy J.M.",Gene,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037811199190435E; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1660838/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/037811199190435E,251

Recent recommendations highlight the important role of remote monitoring to prevent exposure to the virus. This study compared remote monitoring of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) in patients whose in‐person annual visit was substituted for a remote monitoring session with patients who were already scheduled for a remote monitoring session. METHODS: This was a cross‐sectional observational study of 329 consecutive patients between 20 March and 24 April 2020. Group 1 included 131 patients whose in‐person annual visit was substituted for a remote monitoring session. Group 2 included 198 patients who underwent a remote monitoring session as scheduled in their usual device follow‐up.

RESULTS: In group 1, 15 patients (11.5%) experienced a clinical event compared to 15 patients (7.6%) in group 2 (P = .25). Nineteen patients (14.5%) required a physician intervention in group 1 compared to 19 patients (9.6%) in group 2 (P = .22). Two patients (1.5%) in group 1 and four patients (2.0%) in group 2 required an early in‐person follow‐up visit during the pandemic (P > .99). CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring of ICDs is useful to identify clinical events and allows physicians to treat patients appropriately during the COVID‐19 pandemic regardless of the time interval since their last in‐person visit. It reduces significantly in‐person visit for regular follow‐up.","De Larochellière, Hugo; Champagne, Jean; Sarrazin, Jean‐François; Steinberg, Christian; Philippon, François; Roy, Karine; Molin, Franck; O'Hara, Gilles; Plourde, Benoit; Blier, Louis; Nault, Isabelle",Pacing Clin Electrophysiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33021739/; https://doi.org/10.1111/pace.14086,251
663231,Influenza vaccination coverage in Japan,2003-11-22,"Abstract The series of 16 novel amino acid and peptide mycophenolic acid (MPA) derivatives was obtained as potential antibacterial agents. Coupling of MPA with respective amines was optimized with condensing reagents such as EDCI/DMAP and T3P/TEA. Amino acid analogs were received both as methyl esters and also with the free carboxylic group. The biological activity of the products was tested on five references bacterial strains: Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (ESBL), Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus MRSA ATCC 43300, Staphylococcus aureus MSSA ATCC 25923. Peptide derivatives proved to be the most versatile ones, their MIC values relative to most strains was lower than MPA alone. It has been noted that the activity of amino acid derivatives depends on the configuration at the chiral center in the amino acid unit and methyl esters indicated better antimicrobial activity than analogs with free carboxylic group.","Siebert, Agnieszka; Wysocka, Magdalena; Krawczyk, Beata; Cholewiński, Grzegorz; Rachoń, Janusz",European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523417309972; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523417309972; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2017.11.094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29216563/,251
663289,Association between Angiotensin Blockade and Incidence of Influenza in the United Kingdom,2020-05-08,"We consider a mathematical model with five compartments relevant to depict the feature of a certain type of epidemic transmission. We aim to identify some system parameters by means of a minimization problem for a functional involving available measurements for observable compartments, which we treat by an optimal control technique with a state constraint imposed by realistic considerations. The proof of the maximum principle is done by passing to the limit in the conditions of optimality for an appropriate approximating problem. The proof of the estimates for the dual approximating system requires a more challenging treatment since the trajectories are not absolutely continuous, but only with bounded variation. These allow to pass to the limit to obtain the conditions of optimality for the primal problem and lead to a singular dual backward system with a generalized solution in the sense of measure. As far as we know, this approach developed here for the identification of parameters in an epidemic model considering a state constraint related to the actions undertaken for the disease containment was not addressed in the literature and represents a novel issue in this paper.","Marinoschi, Gabriela",Appl Math Optim,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00245-021-09815-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511660/,251

METHOD: We conducted an online cross-sectional self-report survey. Whole group analysis compared pre- versus post-COVID restrictions. A correlation coefficient matrix evaluated the associations between all outcome scores. Self-report data was compared with Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores from the 2014 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey. Multiple linear modelling (MLM) was calculated to identify factors associated with increasing AUDIT scores and post-restriction AUDIT scores. RESULTS: In total, 346 individuals completed the survey, of which 336 reported drinking and were therefore analysed. After COVID-19 restrictions 23.2% of respondents reported an increased AUDIT score, and 60.1% a decreased score. AUDIT score change was positively correlated with change in depression (P < 0.01, r = 0.15), anxiety (P < 0.01, r = 0.15) and drinking to cope scores (P < 0.0001, r = 0.35). MLM revealed that higher AUDIT scores were associated with age, mental illness, lack of a garden, self-employed or furloughed individuals, a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and smoking status. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 restrictions decreased alcohol consumption for the majority of individuals in this study. However, a small proportion increased their consumption; this related to drinking to cope and increased depression and anxiety.","Palmer, Emily O.

We report an extremely severe case of coronavirus pneumonia in an over 80-year-old patient with hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Despite a clearly poor anamnestic and clinical prognostic forecast, she was successfully discharged thanks to a careful evaluation of the case and of the complications that have arisen.

In this sense, the role that essential and toxic metals/metalloids have in the development and course of this disease is being studied. Metals/metalloids such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury or vanadium, are elements with known toxic effects in mammals, while trace elements such as cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, selenium and zinc are considered essential. Given the importance of metals/metalloids in nutrition and human health, the present review was aimed at assessing the relationship between various essential and toxic metals/metalloids and the health outcomes related with the COVID-19. We are in the position to conclude that particular attention must be paid to the load/levels of essential trace elements in COVID-19 patients, mainly zinc and selenium. On the other hand, the exposure to air pollutants in general, and toxic metal/metalloids in particular, should be avoided as much as possible to reduce the possibilities of viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2.","Domingo, Jose L.; Marquès, Montse",Food Chem Toxicol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33794307/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278691521001940; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2021.112161; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691521001940?v=s5,251

Sharing structural and behavioral similarities with its ancestors [SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)], SARS-CoV-2 has lower fatality but faster transmission. We have gone through a long path to recognize SARS and MERS, therefore our knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 is not raw. Various responses of the immune system account for the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Given the innate immune response as the front line of defense, it is immediately activated after the virus entry. Consequently, adaptive immune response is activated to eradicate the virus. However, this does not occur in every case and immune response is the main culprit causing the pathological manifestations of COVID-19. Lethal forms of the disease are correlated with inefficient and/or insufficient immune responses associated with cytokine storm. Current therapeutic approach for COVID-19 is in favor of suppressing extreme inflammatory responses, while maintaining the immune system alert and responsive against the virus. This could be contributing along with administration of antiviral drugs in such patients. Furthermore, supplementation with different compounds, such as vitamin D, has been tested to modulate the immune system responses. A thorough understanding of chronological events in COVID-19 contributing to the development of a highly efficient treatment has not figured out yet. This review focuses on the virus-immune system interaction as well as currently available and potential therapeutic approaches targeting immune system in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Ebrahimi, Negin; Aslani, Saeed; Babaie, Farhad; Hemmatzadeh, Maryam; Hosseinzadeh, Ramin; Joneidi, Zeinab; Mehdizadeh Tourzani, Zahra; Pakravan, Nafiseh; Mohammadi, Hamed",Int Immunopharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107082; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576920328393?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576920328393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33068865/,251

Here we report two sensitive and automated testing-on-a-probe (TOP) biosensor assays for SARS-CoV-2 viral specific total antibodies (TAb) and surrogate neutralizing antibodies (SNAb), which are suitable for clinical use. The TOP assays employ an RBD-coated quartz probe using a Cy5-Streptavidin-polysacharide conjugate to improved sensitivity and minimize interference. Disposable cartridge containing pre-dispensed reagents requires no liquid manipulation or fluidics during testing. The TOP-TAb assay exhibited higher sensitivity in the 0-7 DAOS window than a widely used FDA-EUA assay. The rapid (18 min) and automated TOP-SNAb correlated well with two well-established SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization tests. The clinical utility of the TOP assays was demonstrated by evaluating early antibody responses in 120 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive adult hospitalized patients. Higher baseline TAb and SNAb positivity rates and more robust antibody responses were seen in patients who survived COVID-19 than those who died in the hospital. Survival analysis using the Cox Proportional Hazards Model showed that patients who were TAb and SNAb negative at initial hospital presentation were at a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, TAb and SNAb levels at presentation were inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load based on concurrent RT-PCR testing. Overall, the sensitive and automated TAb and SNAb assays allow detection of early SARS-CoV-2 antibodies which associate with mortality.","Yang, H. S.; Racine-Brzostek, S.

AIMS: This was an observational retrospective cohort from electronic medical records of hospitalized patients (n = 2655) with confirmed COVID-19 between February 15, 2020, and April 15, 2020, in 182 hospitals from a large health system in the USA. The review of data yielded to a total of 79 patients in 20 hospitals who had CSF analysis. METHODS: Outcomes during hospitalization, including hospital length of stay, disease severity, ventilator time, and in-hospital death were recorded. Independent variables collected included patient demographics, diagnoses, laboratory values, and procedures. RESULTS: A total of 79 patients underwent CSF analysis. Of these, antigen testing was performed in 73 patients. Ten patients had CSF analysis for general markers such as total protein, cell count, glucose, clarity, and color. Seven of the 10 cases (70%) had normal total cell count and normal white blood cell count in CSF. Sixty-three percent (5/8) had elevated total protein. Two patients had normal levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and 1 patient had significantly elevated (fourfold) neuron-specific enolase (NSE) level in CSF. CONCLUSION: Unlike bacterial infections, viral infections are less likely to cause remarkable changes in CSF glucose, cell count, or protein. Our observations showed no pleocytosis, but mild increase in protein in the CSF of the COVID-19 patients. The fourfold elevation of NSE may have diagnostic/prognostic value as a biomarker in CSF for COVID-19 patients who have altered mental status.

It changed the view of global health and safety, trust in the healthcare system, and clients’ willingness to seek healthcare. To contain the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and its detrimental effects, understanding peoples’ health behavior, especially healthcare-seeking, and determining the community risk perception is very important. Thus, this study aimed to determine the health-seeking behavior, community’s risk perception to COVID-19 pandemics, and factors influencing the community risk perception in Harari regional state, Ethiopia. METHODS: Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 5 to 30 February 2021. A total of 1320 adult (>18 years) participants were selected using systematic random sampling. The data were collected using an online kobo collect toolbox and analyzed using descriptive statistical tests. Chi-square test and multiple binary logistic regression were applied to examine the difference between variables. A p-value < 0.05 was considered to be of statistical significance. RESULTS: The study included 1296 respondents >18 years old. The overall prevalence of willingness to seek healthcare in the study area was 35.6% (95% CI: 33%–38.3.0%). The mean cumulative score of risk perception was 30.5 (SD ± 7.25) with the minimum and maximum score of 13 and 63, respectively. A total of 656 (50.6%) of the participants had low-risk perceptions concerning COVID-19. The study found a statistically significant association between risk perception and sociodemographic characteristics (age, educational status, and income), and knowledge of the respondents. CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence of willingness to seek healthcare was 35.6%. Healthcare intervention aimed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic should consider the factors associated with the study area. Similarly, the study found a low-risk perception among the community that needs critical action to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and to protect the community as a whole. Thus, it is necessary to improve community risk perception through health education.","Eyeberu, Addis; Mengistu, Dechasa Adare; Negash, Belay; Alemu, Addisu; Abate, Degu; Raru, Temam Beshir; Wayessa, Alemayehu Deressa; Debela, Adera; Bahiru, Nebiyu; Heluf, Helina; Kure, Mohammed Abdurke; Abdu, Ahmedmenewer; Dulo, Amanuel Oljira; Bekele, Habtamu; Bayu, Kefelegn; Bogale, Saron; Atnafe, Genanaw; Assefa, Tewodros; Belete, Rabuma; Muzeyin, Mohammed; Asmerom, Haftu; Arkew, Mesay; Mohammed, Anumein; Asfaw, Henock; Taddesse, Barkot; Alemu, Daniel; Yihun, Dawit; Amare, Shambel Nigussie; Kebira, Jemal Yusuf; Adem, Siraj Aliyi; Dirirsa, Gebisa; Girmay, Saba Hailu; Godana, Abduro; Dechasa, Deribe Bekele; Dessie, Yadeta",SAGE Open Med,https://doi.org/10.1177/20503121211036132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377473/,251

To the best of our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the effects of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on recovered COVID-19 patients after weaning from mechanical ventilation. Therefore, this study assessed the efficacy of IMT on recovered COVID-19 patients following mechanical ventilation. METHODS. Forty-two recovered COVID-19 patients (33 men and 9 women) weaned from mechanical ventilation with a mean age of 48.05 ± 8.85 years were enrolled in this pilot control clinical study. Twenty-one patients were equipped to 2-week IMT (IMT group) and 21 matched peers were recruited as a control (control group). Forced vital capacity (FVC%), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1%), dyspnea severity index (DSI), quality of life (QOL), and six-minute walk test (6-MWT) were assessed initially before starting the study intervention and immediately after intervention. RESULTS. Significant interaction effects were observed in the IMT when compared to control group, FVC% (F = 5.31, P = .041, ηP(2) = 0.13), FEV1% (F = 4.91, P = .043, ηP(2) = 0.12), DSI (F = 4.56, P = .032, ηP(2) = 0.15), QOL (F = 6.14, P = .021, ηP(2) = 0.17), and 6-MWT (F = 9.34, P = .028, ηP(2) = 0.16). Within-group analysis showed a significant improvement in the IMT group (FVC%, P = .047, FEV1%, P = .039, DSI, P = .001, QOL, P < .001, and 6-MWT, P < .001), whereas the control group displayed nonsignificant changes (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS. A 2-week IMT improves pulmonary functions, dyspnea, functional performance, and QOL in recovered intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 patients after consecutive weaning from mechanical ventilation. IMT program should be encouraged in the COVID-19 management protocol, specifically with ICU patients.","Abodonya, Ahmed M.; Abdelbasset, Walid Kamal; Awad, Elsayed A.; Elalfy, Ibrahim E.; Salem, Hosni A.; Elsayed, Shereen H.",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33787632/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000025339,251

It is suspected that selected mutations in the associated Fusion (F) protein may also be important in regulating fusion activity. To better understand the underlying mechanisms involved in ISAV fusion, several mutated F proteins were generated from the Scottish Nevis and Norwegian SK779/06 HPR0. Co-transfection with constructs encoding HE and F were performed, fusion activity assessed by content mixing assay and the degree of proteolytic cleavage by western blot. Substitutions in Nevis F demonstrated that K276 was the most likely cleavage site in the protein. Furthermore, amino acid substitutions at three sites and two insertions, all slightly upstream of K276, increased fusion activity. Co-expression with HE harbouring a full-length HPR produced high fusion activities when trypsin and low pH were applied. In comparison, under normal culture conditions, groups containing a mutated HE with an HPR deletion were able to generate moderate fusion levels, while those with a full length HPR HE could not induce fusion. This suggested that HPR length may influence how the HE primes the F protein and promotes fusion activation by an ubiquitous host protease and/or facilitate subsequent post-cleavage refolding steps. Variations in fusion activity through accumulated mutations on surface glycoproteins have also been reported in other orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses. This may in part contribute to the different virulence and tissue tropism reported for HPR0 and HPR deleted ISAV genotypes.","Fourrier, Mickael; Lester, Katherine; Markussen, Turhan; Falk, Knut; Secombes, Christopher J.; McBeath, Alastair; Collet, Bertrand",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0142020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26517828/,251

Cellular immunotherapy with virus-specific cytotoxic T cells have yielded promising results but requires donor/recipient matching. Gamma delta (γδ) T cells are involved in antiviral immunity and can recognize antigens independently of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and may not require the same level of matching. We assessed the phenotype of circulating γδ T cells following LTx to identify candidate populations for CMV immunotherapy. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from LTx recipients pre-transplant and at routine bronchoscopies post-LTx. Patients were stratified by risk of CMV disease into moderate risk (MR, recipient CMV seropositive, n=15) or high-risk (HR, recipient CMV seronegative/donor CMV seropositive, n=10). CMV replication was classified as PCR positive (>150 copies/ml) in blood and/or bronchoalveolar lavage within the first 18-months. The phenotype of γδ T cells was assessed by multi-colour flow cytometry and T cell receptor (TCR) sequences were determined deep sequencing. RESULTS: In HR LTx recipients with CMV replication, we observed striking phenotypic changes in γδ T cells, marked by an increase in the proportion of effector Vδ1+ γδ T cells expressing the activating natural killer cell receptor NKG2C. Moreover, we observed a remarkable increase in TCR diversity. CONCLUSION: NKG2C+ Vδ1+ γδ T cells were associated with CMV replication and may indicate their potential to control infection. As such, we propose they could be a potential target for cellular therapy against CMV.","Stankovic, Sanda; Davey, Martin S.; Shaw, Evangeline M.; von Borstel, Anouk; Cristiano, Yvonne; Levvey, Bronwyn J.; Rossjohn, Jamie; Westall, Glen P.; Snell, Gregory I.; Brooks, Andrew G.; Sullivan, Lucy C.",J Heart Lung Transplant,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053249820317034?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962919/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2020.08.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053249820317034,251
670778,Incorporating foot assessment in the comprehensive geriatric assessment,2021-04-01,"SARS-CoV-2 attacks various organs, most destructively the lung, and cellular entry requires two host cell surface proteins: ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Downregulation of one or both of these is thus a potential therapeutic approach for COVID-19. TMPRSS2 is a known target of the androgen receptor, a ligand-activated transcription factor; androgen receptor activation increases TMPRSS2 levels in various tissues, most notably prostate. We show here that treatment with the antiandrogen enzalutamide—a well-tolerated drug widely used in advanced prostate cancer—reduces TMPRSS2 levels in human lung cells and in mouse lung. Importantly, antiandrogens significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection in lung cells. In support of this experimental data, analysis of existing datasets shows striking co-expression of AR and TMPRSS2, including in specific lung cell types targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Together, the data presented provides strong evidence to support clinical trials to assess the efficacy of antiandrogens as a treatment option for COVID-19.","Leach, D. A.; Mohr, A.; Giotis, E.

Thus, in the RESTART study we compared antigen and RT-PCR testing methods on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and salivary samples. We conducted a prospective observational study among COVID-19 hospitalized patients between 10 December 2020 and 1 February 2021. Paired saliva and NP samples were investigated by RT-PCR (Cobas 6800, Roche-Switzerland, Basel, Switzerland) and by two rapid antigen tests: One Step Immunoassay Exdia(®) COVID-19 Ag (Precision Biosensor, Daejeon, Korea) and Standard Q(®) COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test (Roche-Switzerland). A total of 58 paired NP-saliva specimens were collected. A total of 32 of 58 (55%) patients were hospitalized in the intensive care unit, and the median duration of symptoms was 11 days (IQR 5-19). NP and salivary RT-PCR exhibited sensitivity of 98% and 69% respectively, whereas the specificity of these RT-PCRs assays was 100%. The NP RATs exhibited much lower diagnostic performance, with sensitivities of 35% and 41% for the Standard Q(®) and Exdia(®) assays, respectively, when a wet-swab approach was used (i.e., when the swab was diluted in the viral transport medium (VTM) before testing). The sensitivity of the dry-swab approach was slightly better (47%). These antigen tests exhibited very low sensitivity (4% and 8%) when applied to salivary swabs. Nasopharyngeal RT-PCR is the most accurate test for COVID-19 diagnosis in hospitalized patients. RT-PCR on salivary samples may be used when nasopharyngeal swabs are contraindicated.

Currently, telehealth experiences and encounters are being described but not yet extensively evaluated by palliative care teams. OBJECTIVES: To locate survey instruments available to assess telehealth interactions, to determine the content and constructs covered by the available instruments, and to describe the patient populations previously surveyed by the existing instruments. METHODS: This study and its reporting followed PRISMA guidelines with the protocol registered in PROSPERO. Three databases were searched with over 3,100 articles analyzed for use of a telehealth survey instrument. RESULTS: Twelve telehealth communication assessment instruments were identified with mean length 20 questions, primarily Likert-scale responses with one inclusive of free-text and one qualitative inquiry survey. Three inquired only into modality, four queried communication, and five studied both modality and communication experience. Existing telehealth survey instruments are uni-directional in exploring patient or family experience with two inclusive of provider perspectives. Participant demographics are notably under-reported in telehealth experience studies with a frank lack of diversity in ethnic/racial, geographic, age, educational, and income representativeness in current telehealth survey instrument respondents. CONCLUSION: Palliative care teams may consider familiarity with telehealth survey instrument as an essential component to progress from description of telehealth use to evaluation of telehealth encounters.

674544,Cardiac problem and MERS,2015-10-11,"PURPOSE: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels discriminate between patients with mild and severe COVID-19, making IL-6 inhibition an attractive therapeutic strategy. We conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis, trial sequential analysis (TSA), and meta-regression of randomized-controlled trials to ascertain the benefit of IL-6 blockade with tocilizumab for COVID-19. METHODS: We included randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) allocating patients with COVID-19 to tocilizumab. Our control group included standard care or placebo. Trials co-administering other pharmacological interventions for COVID-19 were not excluded. Primary outcome was 2830day mortality. Secondary outcomes included progression-to-severe disease defined as need for mechanical ventilation, intensive-care unit (ICU) admission, or a composite. RESULTS: We identified 10 RCTs using tocilizumab, 9 of which reported primary outcome data (mortality), recruiting 6493 patients with 3358 (52.2%) allocated to tocilizumab. Tocilizumab may be associated with an improvement in mortality (24.4% vs. 29.0%; OR 0.87 [0.741.01]; p=0.07; I(2)=10%; TSA adjusted CI 0.661.14). Meta-regression suggested a relationship between treatment effect and mortality risk, with benefit at higher levels of risk (logOR vs %risk beta=0.018 [0.037 to 0.002]; p=0.07). Tocilizumab did reduce the need for mechanical ventilation and was associated with a benefit in the composite secondary outcome but did not reduce ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: For hospitalized COVID-19 patients, there is some evidence that tocilizumab use may be associated with a short-term mortality benefit, but further high-quality data are required. Its benefits may also lie in reducing the need for mechanical ventilation.

CD200R1 signaling inhibits the expression of proinflammatory molecules including tumor necrosis factor, interferons, and inducible nitric oxide synthase in response to selected stimuli. Unsurprisingly, due to the regulatory role that CD200R1 plays in multiple inflammatory pathways, an increasing number of parasitic, bacterial, and viral pathogens exploit this pathway to suppress host defenses. A complete understanding of the pathways regulated by CD200R1 signaling and the diverse mechanisms that pathogens have evolved to manipulate the CD200:CD200R1 pathway can help identify clinical situations where targeting this interaction can be of therapeutic benefit. In this review, we compare CD200R1 to other pathogen-targeted inhibitory receptors and highlight how this signaling pathway is utilized by a diverse number of pathogens and, therefore, may represent a novel targeting strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases.","Vaine, Christine A.; Soberman, Roy J.",Advances in Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-800100-4.00005-2; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128001004000052; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128001004000052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24388216/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4617684?pdf=render,251
676579,Laparoscopic Major Hepatectomy—Technique and Outcomes,2015-09-11,"INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory infections (ARI), including influenza, comprise a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Influenza surveillance provides important information to inform policy on influenza control and vaccination. While the epidemiology of influenza has been well characterized in western countries, few data exist on influenza epidemiology in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. We describe the epidemiology of influenza virus in Oman. METHODS: Using syndromic case definitions and protocols, patients from four regional hospitals in Oman were enrolled in a descriptive prospective study to characterize the burden of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza. Eligible patients provided demographic information as well as oropharyngeal (OP) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. Specimens were tested for influenza A and influenza B; influenza A viruses were subtyped using RT-PCR. RESULTS: From January 2008 through June 2013, a total of 5,147 cases were enrolled and tested for influenza. Influenza strains were detected in 8% of cases for whom samples were available. Annual incidence rates ranged from 0.5 to 15.4 cases of influenza-associated SARI per 100,000 population. The median age of influenza patients was 6 years with children 0–2 years accounting for 34% of all influenza-associated hospitalizations. By contrast, the median age of non-influenza SARI cases was 1 year with children 0–2 years comprising 59% of SARI. Compared to non-influenza SARI cases, a greater proportion of influenza cases had pre-existing chronic conditions and underwent ventilation during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza virus is associated with a substantial proportion of SARI in Oman. Influenza in Oman approximately follows northern hemisphere seasonality, with major peaks in October to December and a lesser peak around April. The burden of influenza was greatest in children and the elderly. Future efforts should examine the burden of influenza in other potential risk groups such as pregnant women to inform interventions including targeted vaccination.","Al-Awaidy, Salah; Hamid, Sarah; Al Obaidani, Idris; Al Baqlani, Said; Al Busaidi, Suleiman; Bawikar, Shyam; El-Shoubary, Waleed; Dueger, Erica L.; Said, Mayar M.; Elamin, Emdeldin; Shah, Parag; Talaat, Maha",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26642055/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144186,251

We aimed to investigate which specific responses from either cellular or humoral immunity associate to severity and progression of COVID-19. Methods: A cohort of 276 patients classified in mild, moderate and severe, was studied. Peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations were quantified by flow cytometry, and immunoglobulins and complement proteins by nephelometry. Results: At admission, dramatic lymphopenia of T, B and NK cells associated to severity. However, only the proportion of B cells increased, while T and NK cells appeared unaffected. Accordingly, the number of plasma cells and circulating follicular helper T cells (cTfh) increased, but levels of IgM, IgA and IgG were unaffected. When degrees of severity were considered, IgG was lower in severe patients, suggesting an IgG consumption by complement activation or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Activated CD56-CD16+ NK-cells, which mediate ADCC, were increased. Regarding complement, C3 and C4 protein levels were higher in mild and moderate, but not in severe patients, compared to healthy donors. Moreover, IgG and C4 decreased from day 0 to day 10 in patients who were hospitalized for more than two weeks, but not in patients who were discharged earlier. Conclusion: Our study provides important clues to understand the immune response observed in COVID-19 patients, which is probably related to viral clearance, but also underlies its pathogenesis and severity. This study associates for the first time COVID-19 severity with an imbalanced humoral immune response characterized by excessive consumption of IgG and C4, identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention.","Marcos-Jimenez, A.; Sanchez-Alonso, S.; Alcaraz-Serna, A.; Esparcia, L.; Lopez-Sanz, C.; Sampedro-Nunez, M.; Mateu-Albero, T.; Sanchez-Cerrillo, I.; Martinez-Fleta, P.; Gabrie, L.; Del Campo, L.; Lopez-Trascasa, M.; Martin-Gayo, E.; Calzada, M.; Castaneda, S.; de la Fuente, H.; Gonzalez-Alvaro, I.; Sanchez-Madrid, F.; Munoz-Calleja, C.; Alfranca, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.15.20131706v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.20131706,251

The duration of scholarly journals’ publication process is one of the main factors hindering quick delivery of new information. While proper editorial assessment and peer review obviously require some time, turnaround times for medical journals can be up to several months, which is undesirable in the era of a crisis. Following initiatives of medical journals and scholarly publishers to accelerate their publication process, this study assesses whether medical journals have indeed managed to speed up their publication process for Covid-19 related articles. It studies the duration of 14 medical journals’ publication process both during and prior to the current pandemic. Assessing a total of 669 articles, the study concludes that medical journals have indeed drastically accelerated the publication process for Covid-19 related articles since the outbreak of the pandemic. Compared to articles published in the same journals before the pandemic, turnaround times have decreased on average by 49%. The largest decrease in number of days between submission and publication of articles was due to a decrease in the number of days required for peer review. For articles not related to Covid-19, no acceleration of the publication process is found. While the acceleration of journals’ publication process is laudable from the perspective of quick information dissemination, it also raises concerns relating to the quality of the peer review process and the quality of the resulting publications.","Horbach, Serge P.J.M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.18.045963,251

Passive immune therapy including anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (hIVIG) was a logical candidate for COVID-19 therapeutic trials, given past success treating emerging pathogens with endogenous neutralizing antibodies. We established a plasma collection protocol for persons recovered from COVID-19. To speed recruitment in the first U.S. hotspot, Seattle, Washington, federal and state public health agencies collaborated with Bloodworks Northwest to collect convalescent plasma (CP) for manufacturing hIVIG. During March-December 2020, we identified and recruited prospective CP donors via letters to persons recovered from COVID-19 with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Prospective donors were pre-screened and administered a medical history survey. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers were classified as qualifying (≥1:80) or non-qualifying (<1:80) for enrollment based on a live virus neutralization assay. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify characteristics of donors associated with qualifying versus nonqualifying NAb titers. Overall, 21,359 letters resulted in 3207 inquiries, 2159 prescreenings with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 573 donors (27% of all pre-screenings with confirmed infection) who provided a screening plasma donation. Of 573 donors screened, 254 (44%) provided plasma with qualifying NAb titers, resulting in 1284 units for hIVIG manufacture. In a multivariable model, after adjusting for other factors, time (60 days) from COVID-19 symptom onset to screening was associated with lower odds of qualifying NAb (adjusted odds ratio = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.48-0.94). The collaboration facilitated a rapid response to develop and provide hIVIG for clinical trials and CP for transfusion. Only 1 in 12 donor inquiries resulted in a qualifying plasma donation. Challenges included recruitment and the relatively low percentage of persons with high NAb titers and limited screening capacity. This resource-intensive collaboration may not be scalable but informs preparedness and response strategies for plasma collection in future epidemics. Operational readiness plans with templates for screening, consent, and data collection forms are recommended.","Miller, Maureen J; Skrzekut, Adam; Kracalik, Ian; Jones, Jefferson M; Lofy, Kathryn H; Konkle, Barbara A; Haley, N Rebecca; Duvenhage, Michael; Bonnett, Tyler; Holbrook, Michael; Higgs, Elizabeth; Basavaraju, Sridhar V; Paranjape, Suman",Transfusion,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34510475/; https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16630,251

Time spent outside is associated with positive mental health; however, opportunities to be outside were likely affected by the COVID-19 public health restrictions that encouraged people not to leave their homes unless it was required. This study investigated the impact of acute COVID-19 public health restrictions on outside time in April 2020, and quantified the association between outside time and both stress and positive mental health, using secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from the COVID and Well-being Study.

680435,COVID-19 and cancer: do we really know what we think we know?,2020-05-18,"Pathological vascular wall remodeling refers to the structural and functional changes of the vessel wall that occur in response to injury that eventually leads to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Vessel wall are composed of two major primary cells types, endothelial cells (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The physiological communications between these two cell types (EC–VSMCs) are crucial in the development of the vasculature and in the homeostasis of mature vessels. Moreover, aberrant EC–VSMCs communication has been associated to the promotor of various disease states including vascular wall remodeling. Paracrine regulations by bioactive molecules, communication via direct contact (junctions) or information transfer via extracellular vesicles or extracellular matrix are main crosstalk mechanisms. Identification of the nature of this EC–VSMCs crosstalk may offer strategies to develop new insights for prevention and treatment of disease that curse with vascular remodeling. Here, we will review the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between EC and VSMCs. Additionally, we highlight the potential applicable methodologies of the co-culture systems to identify cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in pathological vascular wall remodeling, opening questions about the future research directions.","Méndez-Barbero, Nerea; Gutiérrez-Muñoz, Carmen; Colio, Luis Miguel Blanco",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34298897/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22147284,251

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and persistence of the immune response after vaccination against pandemic influenza A (H1N1pdm09) with an adjuvanted vaccine in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults using two single and two double doses. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Open label, randomized trial to evaluate the immune response following H1N1pdm09 vaccination in HIV-infected participants compared to HIV-negative controls (NCT01155037). HIV-infected participants were randomized to receive 2 single (3.75 µg hemagglutinin) or 2 double (7.5 µg hemagglutinin) doses of the vaccine, 21 days apart. Controls received one dose of the vaccine. The primary endpoint was seroconversion as measured by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Two hundred fifty six HIV-infected participants (129 and 127 randomized to single and double doses, respectively) and 71 HIV-negative controls were enrolled. Among HIV-infected participants, seroconversion increased from 46.7% and 51.7% after the first dose to 77.2% and 83.8% after the second dose of the vaccine using single and double doses, respectively. Participants aged >40 years showed higher seroconversion compared to younger participants. Seroconversion among HIV-infected women and those with nadir CD4<200 cells/mm(3) was significantly higher with double doses. Persistence of protective antibodies six months after vaccination was achieved by 80% and 89.9% of the HIV-infected participants who received single and double doses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results support the recommendation of two double doses of adjuvanted H1N1pdm09 vaccine for HIV-infected individuals, particularly women, and those aged >40 years or with nadir CD4<200 cells/mm(3), to achieve antibody levels that are both higher and more sustained.

This study examined the long‐term outcome of pulmonary function, exercise capacity, health and work status among SARS survivors. Methods: A prospective cohort study of SARS patients at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong was conducted, with serial assessments of lung function, 6MWD and 36 item Short Form General Health Survey at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after disease onset. The work status was also recorded. Results: Serial assessments were completed by 55 of the 123 (39.9%) subjects, of whom 27 were health‐care workers (HCW). The mean age of the group was 44.4 (SD 13.2) years and 19 (34.5%) were males. At 24 months, 10 (18.2%), 9 (16.4%), 6 (10.9%) and 29 (52.7%) subjects had FEV(1), FVC, TLC and DL(CO) < 80% of predicted values, respectively. The mean (SD) 6MWD increased significantly from 439.0 (89.1) m at 3 months to 460.1 (102.8) m at 6 months (P 0.016) and became steady after 6 months. However, 6MWD and 36 item Short Form General Health Survey scores were lower than the normal population throughout the study.

Our aim was to analyze and present the clinical outcomes of EES for the management of these lesions in a community hospital setting. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 56 patients with sellar, suprasellar, and anterior skull base lesions who underwent EES between 2010 and 2018. RESULTS: There was male predominance (53.6%) with a mean age of 54.9 ± 13.7 years. Lesions were 45 pituitary adenomas, 5 meningiomas, 3 metastatic, 1 craniopharyngioma, 1 Rathke cyst, and 1 mucocele. Gross total excision was achieved in 57.1%, subtotal excision occurred in 37.5%, and decompression and biopsy were achieved in 5.4% patients. Postoperative vision normalized or improved in 27 patients (86.1%) and was stable in 4 patients (13.9%). Recovery of a preexisting hormonal deficit occurred in 13 (23.2%) patients, and a new hormonal deficit occurred in 9 patients (16.1%). The mean hospital stay was 6.1 ± 4.9 days. Postoperative complications included cerebrospinal fluid leak in 8 patients (14.3%). Four patients (7.1%) had meningitis. Diabetes insipidus was present in 19 patients (33.9%), and postoperative intracranial hematoma requiring evacuation was necessary in 2 patients (3.6%). The mean follow-up duration was 47.5 ± 25.8 months. Lesion progression or recurrence requiring redo surgery occurred in 5 patients (8.9%). Regarding the learning curve, the postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak, meningitis, new hormonal deficits, and diabetes insipidus decreased in the second half of the patients.

Respiratory component of the infectious disease program against SARS-CoV-2 incorporates use of protective airborne respiratory equipment. In this narrative review, we explore the features of Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPR) as well as logistical and evidence based advantages and disadvantages. Simulation study findings support increased heat tolerance and wearer comfort with a PAPR. Although PAPRs have been recommended for high risk procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, this recommendation remains controversial due to lack of evidence. International regulatory bodies do not mandate the use of PAPR for high risk aerosol generating procedures in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Current reports of the choice of protective respiratory technology during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are disparate. Patterns of use appear to be related to geographical locations. Field observational studies do not indicate a difference in healthcare worker infection utilizing PAPR devices versus other compliant respiratory equipment in healthcare workers performing AGPs. Whether a higher PAPR filtration factor translates to decreased infection rates of HCWs remains to be elucidated. Utilization of PAPR with high filtration efficiency may represent an example of “precautionary principle”. Action taken to reduce risk may be guided by logistical advantages of the PAPR system, rather than high level evidence.","Licina, Dr Ana; Silvers, Dr Andrew",Am J Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33186678/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.11.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320309925?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655320309925,251

In addition to those camelids held in captivity, there are domesticated populations of camelids (except vicuña and guanaco) maintained throughout the world. Most are fairly hardy animals, but there are some specific disease concerns. Domesticated llamas and alpacas have become hobby pets and thus management and genetic issues are an increasing source of disease. These include obesity, vitamin and mineral deficiencies and intoxications, metabolic derangements, and congenital malformations (particularly in the young). Domesticated animals are also more prone to degenerative arthropathy and dental disease as they age than wild camelids. Ovarian hydrobursitis is an important source of infertility in dromedaries.

Anti-inflammatory effects of hypoglycemic agents have been reported, and their beneficial or harmful effects in patients with diabetes and COVID-19 remain controversial. Purpose: This study was performed to clarify this association. Data Sources: Relevant literature was searched on China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, Chinese periodical service platform VIP Database, Sinomed (China Biology Medicine, CBM), MedRxiv, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Ovid Databases (LWW), Springer Link, Wiley Online Library, Oxford Academic, Nature Press Group, Cochrane Library and BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine up to November 14, 2020. Study Selection: Only observational studies of hypoglycemic agents vs. drugs or therapy without hypoglycemic agents in adult diabetic patients with COVID-19 were included. Data Extraction: Data of death and poor composite outcomes were extracted. Data Synthesis: The pooled effects were calculated using the fixed-effects or random-effects models based on heterogeneity assessment. Limitation: Most studies were retrospective cohort studies with relative weak capability to verify causality. Conclusion: Home use of metformin might be beneficial in decreasing mortality in diabetic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Spike glycan processing and cleavage, which occur in the Golgi network, are important for fusion at the plasma membrane, promoting both virion infectivity and cell‐to‐cell viral spreading. We show that a KxHxx motif in the cytosolic tail of spike weakly binds the COPβ’ subunit of COPI coatomer, which facilitates some recycling of spike within the Golgi, while releasing the remainder to the cell surface. Although histidine (KxHxx) has been proposed to be equivalent to lysine within di‐lysine endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrieval sequences, we show that histidine‐to‐lysine substitution (KxKxx) retains spike at the ER and prevents glycan processing, protease cleavage, and transport to the plasma membrane.","Jennings, Benjamin C.; Kornfeld, Stuart; Doray, Balraj",FEBS Lett,https://doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.14109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33991349/,251

OBJECTIVES: To qualitatively explore the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of palliative care clinicians. Specifically we sought to: 1) Describe the strategies adopted by palliative care clinicians to cope with new challenges including patient and clinician isolation, prognostication of an emergent disease, and rapidly rising numbers of severely ill patients; 2) Identify additions or adjustments to in-person and system-related palliative care training, methods, and tools made during pandemics. METHODS: This descriptive qualitative study utilized a thematic approach for data analysis of individual, semi-structured interviews with palliative care clinicians (n=25). Codes, categories, and emerging themes were identified through an iterative, comparative method. Methods align with the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) RESULTS: A theme of “Expanding the reach of palliative care for today and the future” was identified with three subthemes: 1) Redefining attitudes and hardship due to collective uncertainty, 2) Breaking with the past towards integrated concept of palliative care, and 3) Building capacity through primary palliative care training. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 forced hospital systems to consider the inclusion of palliative care in unforeseen ways due to an uncontrollable, unpredictable disease. Faced with unprecedented uncertainty, palliative care clinicians utilized strategies for integration and innovation across hospitals, particularly in intensive care units and emergency departments.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the interactive RMT and Conventional Balance Training (CBT) on chronic stroke survivors’ overall balance and balance recovery reaction. METHODS: In this assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial, chronic stroke survivors were randomized to receive twenty training sessions (60-min each) of either RMT or CBT. Pre- and post-training assessments included clinical tests, as well as kinematic measurements and electromyography during simulated forward fall through a “lean-and-release” perturbation system. RESULTS: Thirty participants were recruited (RMT = 16, CBT = 14). RMT led to significant improvement in balance control (Berg Balance Scale: pre = 49.13, post = 52.75; P = .001), gait control (Timed-Up-and-Go Test: pre = 14.66 s, post = 12.62 s; P = .011), and motor functions (Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery: pre = 60.63, post = 65.19; P = .015), which matched the effectiveness of CBT. Both groups preferred to use their non-paretic leg to take the initial step to restore stability, and their stepping leg’s rectus femoris reacted significantly faster post-training (P = .036). CONCLUSION: The RMT was as effective as conventional balance training to provide beneficial effects on chronic stroke survivors’ overall balance, motor function and improving balance recovery with faster muscle response. Trial registration: The study was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03183635, NCT03183635) on 12 June 2017.","Junata, Melisa; Cheng, Kenneth Chik-Chi; Man, Hok Sum; Lai, Charles Wai-Kin; Soo, Yannie Oi-Yan; Tong, Raymond Kai-Yu",J Neuroeng Rehabil,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12984-021-00922-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34635141/,251

688912,Has osteopathy a role to play in treatment of flu?,2009-10-21,"This paper studies the contribution of the workplace to the SES-health gradient. Our analysis is based on a unique dataset that tracks various health outcomes and workplace risks among healthcare workers during the first four months of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The setting provides an exceptional opportunity to test for work-related disparities in health, while controlling for confounding determinants of the SES-health gradient. We find that low-SES nurses were systematically more likely to contract COVID-19 as a result of workplace exposure. These differentials existed in all healthcare institutions, but were particularly large in non-hospital settings. In contrast, we find no relationship between SES and non work-related infection rates. The differences in workplace infection rates are substantially larger than those implied by standard 'task-based' indices of transmission risk, and cannot be attributable to easily identifiable metrics of workplace risk. Together, our results show how subtle differences in work conditions or job duties can substantially contribute to the SES-health gradient.","Godefroy, R.; Lewis, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.21254170v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.23.21254170,251
689819,Dysregulation of lipid metabolism and pathological inflammation in patients with COVID-19,2021-02-03,"Zinc is an essential trace element that is crucial for growth, development, and the maintenance of immune function. Its influence reaches all organs and cell types, representing an integral component of approximately 10% of the human proteome, and encompassing hundreds of key enzymes and transcription factors. Zinc deficiency is strikingly common, affecting up to a quarter of the population in developing countries, but also affecting distinct populations in the developed world as a result of lifestyle, age, and disease-mediated factors. Consequently, zinc status is a critical factor that can influence antiviral immunity, particularly as zinc-deficient populations are often most at risk of acquiring viral infections such as HIV or hepatitis C virus. This review summarizes current basic science and clinical evidence examining zinc as a direct antiviral, as well as a stimulant of antiviral immunity. An abundance of evidence has accumulated over the past 50 y to demonstrate the antiviral activity of zinc against a variety of viruses, and via numerous mechanisms. The therapeutic use of zinc for viral infections such as herpes simplex virus and the common cold has stemmed from these findings; however, there remains much to be learned regarding the antiviral mechanisms and clinical benefit of zinc supplementation as a preventative and therapeutic treatment for viral infections.","Read, Scott A; Obeid, Stephanie; Ahlenstiel, Chantelle; Ahlenstiel, Golo",Adv Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305906/; https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmz013,251
690584,Initial evaluation of a novel electrocardiography sensor-embedded fabric wear during a full marathon,2021-09-14,"Cryptosporidium spp. infections in neonatal dairy calves can cause diarrhoea and, in rare cases, death. The infection is usually self-limiting, but halofuginone lactate (HL) can be used prophylactically. Calves (n = 144) in the study were born during a 2-month period on one farm. A total of 901 serum and 767 faecal samples were collected. Based on HL treatment, the calves were divided into 3 groups: I) not treated, II) treated incorrectly (treatment started > 48 h after birth, or lasted < 7 days), and III) treated correctly (started < 48 h after birth, and lasted ≥ 7 days). Over the 3-month observation period, 14.6% (n = 21) of the calves died, of which most (67%) had not been treated with HL. Correctly performed treatment of cryptosporidiosis significantly delayed the onset of oocysts shedding (P < 0.001) and reduced haptoglobin (HP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) concentrations in the second week of life. HP concentration and HL treatment were negatively associated with weight gain at 3 months of age. Cryptosporidium positive faecal samples were significantly (P < 0.001) more likely to be diarrhoeic but Giardia or Eimeria positive samples were not. Correct prophylactic treatment with HL delayed the shedding of Cryptosporidium oocysts and improved survival, but was negatively associated with weight gain. Incorrect treatment had a low impact on mortality and resembled no treatment regarding the proportion of calves shedding oocysts. Acute phase response (APR) in the second week of life seemed to be positively associated with shedding high amounts of Cryptosporidium oocysts.","Niine, Tarmo; Dorbek-Kolin, Elisabeth; Lassen, Brian; Orro, Toomas",Res Vet Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528817304642; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2017.12.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29304439/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528817304642,251
