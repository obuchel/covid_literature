Further, when attempting to integrate data, differences in existing datasets also impose challenges that limit opportunities for data integration. As a result, the pace of scientific advancements is suboptimal. Synthetic data and virtual cohorts generated using innovative computational techniques represent an opportunity to overcome some of these limitations and consequently, to advance scientific developments. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of virtual cohorts techniques to generate a synthetic dataset that mirrors a deeply phenotyped sample of preclinical dementia research participants.","Muniz-Terrera, Graciela; Mendelevitch, Ofer; Barnes, Rodrigo; Lesh, Michael D.",Front Artif Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34079930/; https://doi.org/10.3389/frai.2021.613956,984
