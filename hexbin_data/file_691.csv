257064,Infection à VIH et vaccination anti-SARS-Cov2,2021,"PURPOSE: We conducted two World Health Organization-commissioned reviews to inform use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We synthesized the evidence regarding efficacy and safety (review 1), as well as risks of droplet dispersion, aerosol generation, and associated transmission (review 2) of viral products. SOURCE: Literature searches were performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Chinese databases, and medRxiv. Review 1: we synthesized results from randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HFNC to conventional oxygen therapy (COT) in critically ill patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Review 2: we narratively summarized findings from studies evaluating droplet dispersion, aerosol generation, or infection transmission associated with HFNC. For both reviews, paired reviewers independently conducted screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. We evaluated certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: No eligible studies included COVID-19 patients. Review 1: 12 RCTs (n = 1,989 patients) provided low-certainty evidence that HFNC may reduce invasive ventilation (relative risk [RR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 0.99) and escalation of oxygen therapy (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.98) in patients with respiratory failure. Results provided no support for differences in mortality (moderate certainty), or in-hospital or intensive care length of stay (moderate and low certainty, respectively). Review 2: four studies evaluating droplet dispersion and three evaluating aerosol generation and dispersion provided very low certainty evidence. Two simulation studies and a crossover study showed mixed findings regarding the effect of HFNC on droplet dispersion. Although two simulation studies reported no associated increase in aerosol dispersion, one reported that higher flow rates were associated with increased regions of aerosol density. CONCLUSIONS: High-flow nasal cannula may reduce the need for invasive ventilation and escalation of therapy compared with COT in COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. This benefit must be balanced against the unknown risk of airborne transmission.","Agarwal, Arnav; Basmaji, John; Muttalib, Fiona; Granton, David; Chaudhuri, Dipayan; Chetan, Devin; Hu, Malini; Fernando, Shannon M; Honarmand, Kimia; Bakaa, Layla; Brar, Sonia; Rochwerg, Bram; Adhikari, Neill K; Lamontagne, Francois; Murthy, Srinivas; Hui, David S C; Gomersall, Charles; Mubareka, Samira; Diaz, Janet V; Burns, Karen E A; Couban, Rachel; Ibrahim, Quazi; Guyatt, Gordon H; Vandvik, Per O",Can J Anaesth,,691

There is a clear need to establish a gold standard diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans using respiratory tract specimens. METHODS: Searches will be conducted in the bibliographic databases Medline, Embase, bioRxiv, medRxiv, F1000, ChemRxiv, PeerJ Preprints, Preprints.org, Beilstein Archive, and Research Square. Relevant government documents and grey literature will be sought on the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorizations website, the ECDC’s website, and the website of the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics. Finally, papers categorized as diagnosis papers by the EPPI Centre’s COVID-19 living systematic map will be added to our screening process; those papers are tagged with the diagnosis topic based on human review, rather than database searches, and thus this set of papers might include ones that have not been captured by our search strategy.","Moore, Adam J.; Nakahata, Maura I.; Kalinich, Chaney C.; Nyhan, Kate; Bromberg, Daniel J.; Shi, Xiaoting; Ko, Albert I.; Grubaugh, Nathan D.; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Wyllie, Anne L.",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.02.20144543v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.02.20144543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32637978/,691
644611,Infection à VIH et vaccination anti-SARS-Cov2()(),2021-02-12,"Symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) range from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia and death. A deep understanding of the variation of biological characteristics in severe COVID-19 patients is crucial for the detection of individuals at high risk of critical condition for the clinical management of the disease. Herein, by profiling the gene expression spectrum deduced from DNA coverage in regions surrounding transcriptional start site in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of COVID-19 patients, we deciphered the altered biological processes in the severe cases and demonstrated the feasibility of cfDNA in measuring the COVID-19 progression. The up- and downregulated genes in the plasma of severe patient were found to be closely related to the biological processes and functions affected by COVID-19 progression. More importantly, with the analysis of transcriptome data of blood cells and lung cells from control group and cases with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we revealed that the upregulated genes were predominantly involved in the viral and antiviral activity in blood cells, reflecting the intense viral replication and the active reaction of immune system in the severe patients. Pathway analysis of downregulated genes in plasma DNA and lung cells also demonstrated the diminished adenosine triphosphate synthesis function in lung cells, which was evidenced to correlate with the severe COVID-19 symptoms, such as a cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress. Overall, this study revealed tissue involvement, provided insights into the mechanism of COVID-19 progression, and highlighted the utility of cfDNA as a noninvasive biomarker for disease severity inspections.","Chen, Xinping; Wu, Tao; Li, Lingguo; Lin, Yu; Ma, Zhichao; Xu, Jinjin; Li, Hui; Cheng, Fanjun; Chen, Ruoyan; Sun, Kun; Luo, Yuxue; Zhang, Chen; Chen, Fang; Wang, Jiao; Kuo, Tingyu; Li, Xiaojuan; Geng, Chunyu; Lin, Feng; Huang, Chaojie; Hu, Junjie; Yin, Jianhua; Liu, Ming; Tao, Ye; Zhang, Jiye; Ou, Rijing; Zheng, Fang; Jin, Yan; Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jian; Xu, Xun; Fu, Shengmiao; Jiang, Hongyan; Jin, Xin; Zhang, Haiqiang",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34122515/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.663098,691

This virus is highly transmissible among individuals through both droplets and aerosol leading to determine severe pneumonia. Among the various factors that can influence both the onset of disease and the severity of its complications, the microbiome composition has also been investigated. Recent evidence showed the possible relationship between gut, lung, nasopharyngeal, or oral microbiome and COVID-19, but very little is known about it. Therefore, we aimed to verify the relationships between nasopharyngeal microbiome and the development of either COVID-19 or the severity of symptoms. To this purpose, we analyzed, by next generation sequencing, the hypervariable V1-V2-V3 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA in nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (n=18) and control (CO) individuals (n=12) using Microbiota solution A (Arrow Diagnostics). We found a significant lower abundance of Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria in COVID-19 patients in respect to CO (p=0.003 and p<0.0001, respectively) from the phylum up to the genus (p<0.001). The Fusobacterium periodonticum (FP) resulted as the most significantly reduced species in COVID-19 patients respect to CO. FP is reported as being able to perform the surface sialylation. Noteworthy, some sialic acids residues on the cell surface could work as additional S protein of SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 could use sialic acids as receptors to bind to the epithelium of the respiratory tract, promoting its clustering and the disease development. We can therefore speculate that the significant reduction of FP in COVID-19 patients could be directly or indirectly linked to the modulation of sialic acid metabolism. Finally, viral or environmental factors capable of interfering with sialic metabolism could determine a fall in the individual protection from SARS-CoV-2. Further studies are necessary to clarify the precise role of FP in COVID-19.","Nardelli, Carmela; Gentile, Ivan; Setaro, Mario; Di Domenico, Carmela; Pinchera, Biagio; Buonomo, Antonio Riccardo; Zappulo, Emanuela; Scotto, Riccardo; Scaglione, Giovanni Luca; Castaldo, Giuseppe; Capoluongo, Ettore",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.625581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33659220/,691
